15165,while dam construction supports social and economic development changes in hydraulic conditions can also affect natural aquatic ecosystems especially microbial ecosystems the compositional and functional traits of multi trophic microbiota can be altered by dam construction which may result in changes in aquatic predator prey interactions to understand this process we performed a large scale sampling campaign in the urban reaches of the dam impacted yangtze river 1 995 km and obtained 211 metagenomic datasets and water quality data we first compared the compositional traits of planktonic microbial communities upstream downstream and in a dam reservoir results showed that bacteroidetes r strategy bacteria were more likely to survive upstream whilst the reservoir and downstream regions were more conducive to the survival of k strategy bacteria such as actinobacteria eukaryotic predators tended to be enriched upstream whilst phototrophs tended to be enriched in the reservoir and downstream regions based on bipartite networks we inferred that the potential microbial predator prey interactions gradually and significantly decreased from upstream to the downstream and dam regions affecting 56 of keystone microbial species remarkably functional analysis showed that the abundance of the photosynthetic gene psbo was higher in the reservoir and downstream regions whilst the abundance of the kegg carbohydrate metabolic pathway was higher upstream these results indicate that dam construction in the yangtze river induced planktonic microbial ecosystem transformation from

economic development as of 2020 more than 58 000 large dams have been documented worldwide https www icold cigb org gb world register general synthesis asp however dam construction is one of the most damaging human activities conducted in river basins dams profoundly modify watershed physiography e g sedimentation and raised water tables threaten water quality increase the risk of reservoir pollution and significantly affect the structure and metabolic function of biological communities in riverine ecosystems fan et al 2015 guo et al 2023 schmutz and sendzimir 2018 furthermore dams prevent fish from traversing their natural routes between feeding and spawning grounds thus interrupting their life cycle and limiting their ability to reproduce barbarossa et al 2020 these shifts in physicochemical conditions and fish activity also alter the structure of organisms at other trophic levels in recent years studies have explored how dam construction impacts microbial communities in river networks luo et al 2020 serrana et al 2021 tobias hünefeldt et al 2021 demonstrating a direct causal relationship between dam construction and shifts in microbial composition and nitrogen transformation gao et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however most studies have focused on individual groups or trophic levels e g bacterial or eukaryotic community composition largely overlooking how dam construction affects ecological interactions among microorganisms from different groups and trophic levels which may trigger cascading effects via top down predation and bottom up resource availability forces in aquatic ecosystems predator prey interactions and their eco evolutionary dynamics are crucial for maintaining microbial diversity and food web stability through top down control predators can maintain high bacterial growth rates and enhance nutrient re mineralization carbon respiration and pollutant degradation otto et al 2017 ratsak et al 1996 yu et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 several factors also affect predator prey relationships for instance higher nutrient levels mitigate the effects of predation on prey survival through bottom up effects peralta maraver et al 2022 increasing temperatures activate individual metabolic processes and enhance growth rates thereby stimulating various biotic interactions including predation rocca et al 2022 flow velocity can affect the movement capacity of organisms and modify the ability that prey to detect chemical alarm cues from predators hayman et al 2020 the presence of acrylate can alter the grazing preference of ciliate to other bacteria in the community thereby influencing community structure teng et al 2021 as dam construction affects environmental change hydrological and nutrient variables affect all levels of the biological hierarchy via both top down and bottom up forces with profound effects on ecosystem function predator grazing can stimulate nitrogen cycling by increasing the abundance of recycled limiting nutrients removing senescent cells and reducing bacterial competition tso and taghon 2006 heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates are direct predators of bacteria in aquatic habitats and predator grazing on bacteria is an important source of regenerated nitrogen pernthaler 2005 recent research has revealed that cascade dam construction may decrease higher trophic level predator biomass and restrain trophic transfer efficiencies in river benthic microbial food webs yang et al 2020 to date however the reshaping of ecosystem function by microbial interactions at different trophic levels altered by dam construction remains unclear in this study we hypothesized that dam construction would affect microbial predator prey interactions by reducing predation pressure due to flow velocity decrease and nutrient retention maavara et al 2017 2015 using shotgun metagenomic sequencing we assessed planktonic microbial communities without primer bias and profiled the functional potential in different urban reaches of the dam impacted yangtze river in china we explored potential causal relationships between dam construction and changes in cross trophic microbial interactions in the yangtze river this study sheds light on the impacts of anthropogenic activities on aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling campaign the yangtze river is the largest river in china and the third longest river in the world with a total length of 6 300 km and a watershed area of 1 800 000 km2 several urban agglomerations exist in the river drainage basin accounting for more than 50 cities above the prefecture level to investigate the planktonic microbial communities of different urban river segments of the yangtze river we collected water samples in january and october 2020 fig 1 all study sites were partitioned into three regions according to their location relative to the three gorges dam and urban reaches a human footprint dataset reflecting different aspects of human pressure was used to illustrate the validity of the urban reaches mu et al 2022 details are provided in text s1 in total we obtained 211 surface water samples no extreme weather occurred during the sampling periods the physicochemical properties of water e g nitrogen and phosphate were analyzed as described in text s2 overall the nutrient concentrations in river water were higher in january than in october in addition nutrient concentrations were higher in the downstream region than in the upstream and reservoir regions in january but there was no significant difference between the upstream and downstream regions in october fig 1 fig s1 details published elsewhere 2 2 dna extraction and shotgun metagenomic sequencing approximately 900 1 800 ml of surface water was

deposited in the china national center for bioinformation database https www cncb ac cn under accession numbers cra008231 and cra006054 2 3 bioinformatics analysis of sequences to identify prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa we extracted small subunit ribosomal rna ssu rrna gene 16s and 18s rrna genes fragments from the filtered clean reads using metaxa2 bengtsson palme et al 2015 the recovered 16s and 18s fragments were clustered to generate an operational taxonomic unit otu table using usearch v10 0 240 edgar 2018 taxonomic classification was performed against the silva 132 database quast et al 2013 and protist ribosomal reference database pr2 v4 13 0 guillou et al 2013 using uclust at a similarity of 97 in qiime v1 9 1 kuczynski et al 2011 alpha and beta diversity indices were calculated in qiime for convenience we referred to the assessed communities as microbial communities although they also included microscopic fauna to characterize the microbial food web pattern we divided bacteria into two functional groups i e autotrophic cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria excluding cyanobacteria yang et al 2018 heterotrophic bacteria hb were considered as prey in microbial food web analysis we further assigned the eukaryotic otus into different functional groups based on feeding mode guo et al 2021 xiong et al 2019 i e phototrophs predators parasites and saprotrophs the photosynthetic gene psbo was used as a proxy for relative cell abundance across the whole phytoplankton community to provide insight into photosynthesis the psbo gene profile in each sample was calculated by aligning the clean shotgun metagenomic sequencing reads to a curated database of 18 000 annotated psbo sequences pierella karlusich et al 2022 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg carbohydrate metabolic pathways were determined by functional annotation in eggnog mapper v5 0 to evaluate microbial heterotrophic respiration huerta cepas et al 2019 details are provided in text s3 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed in r v4 1 1 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was performed using the vegan package v2 5 7 in r analysis of similarity anosim was performed to test differences in prokaryotic and microeukaryotic composition using the vegan package linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was applied to identify differentially abundant taxa which were visualized using the metacoder r package v 0 3 5 foster et al 2017 further details are provided in text s4 all other data visualization tasks were performed using ggplot2 package v3 3 6 to quantify the degree of microbial community connectivity we used the recently developed cohesion framework herren and mcmahon 2017 as described in text s5 we obtained two metrics of cohesion i e positive cohesion reflecting the degree of cooperative behaviors in a sample and negative cohesion indicating the magnitude of competitive behaviors among community members community stability was expressed as the ratio of the absolute value of negative cohesion to positive cohesion molecular ecological networks mens and inter domain ecological networks idens were constructed to determine potential microbial interactions analyses were conducted using the integrated network analysis pipeline inap http mem rcees ac cn 8081 feng et al 2022 including the molecular ecological network analysis mena pipeline and inter domain ecological network analysis pipeline idenap details are described in text s6 networks were visualized in gephi v0 9 2 variance partitioning analysis vpa was used to evaluate the relative contributions of environmental variables physicochemical properties of water reflecting limited environmental selection and spatial variables reflecting spatial autocorrelation in shaping microbial communities using the vegan package v2 5 7 in r spatial variables were expressed using the principal coordinates of neighbor matrices pcnm in r with the vegan package structural equation models sems were used to explore direct and indirect relationships among all variables envisaged in the model using the lavaan package in r rosseel 2012 the experimental data were not completely independent due to repeated measurements for every city in the three dam partitioned regions therefore linear mixed effects models lmms were used to assess the effects of dams on network hubs the lme4 r package was used to implement lmms bates et al 2015 details are described in text s7 3 results 3 1 prokaryotic community composition and coherence we first analyzed the compositional traits of planktonic prokaryotes in the upstream reservoir and downstream sites no significant differences in the alpha diversity indices including shannon chao1 simpson and pd whole tree of planktonic prokaryotes were found between the upstream and reservoir areas however the alpha diversity indices were higher downstream than upstream in january but lower in october fig s2 and table s1 the nmds results showed obvious prokaryotic community clustering in the different regions upstream reservoir and downstream in january and october fig 2 a as confirmed by anosim january r 0 8464 p 0 001 october r 0 7186 p 0 001 in terms of prokaryotic community composition the abundances of actinobacteria and acidobacteria markedly increased in the reservoir and downstream regions while bacteroidetes abundance significantly decreased in january and october fig s3 fig 2b cohesion and ecological networks were used to quantify the degree of connectivity complexity and stability of the ecological communities in both january and october the absolute values of positive and negative cohesion of the prokaryotic communities were lower in the reservoir than in the upstream region fig 2c table s3 average connectivity clustering coefficient and density were also higher upstream than in the reservoir in both january and october table s5 prokaryotic community stability defined as the absolute value of negative cohesion positive cohesion hernandez et al 2021 was significantly higher in the reservoir than downstream in january and was significantly higher in the reservoir than upstream in october fig s4 table s3 network modularity showed a similar trend table s5 overall cohesion and network topological parameter analyses indicated that the reservoir prokaryotic community had lower connectivity and complexity but higher stability than upstream 3 2 eukaryotic community composition and coherence the alpha diversity indices of the planktonic eukaryotic community were higher downstream than in the reservoir and upstream regions in january and october but there was no significant difference between the reservoir and upstream regions fig s5 table s2 similarly the nmds results fig 3 a indicated that eukaryotic communities formed obvious geographic clusters in the different regions in both january and october as confirmed by anosim january r 0 5721 p 0 001 october r 0 5441 p 0 001 the eukaryotic communities were mainly comprised of protists metazoans and fungi fig s6 the protists were dominated by ochrophyta cryptophyta ciliophora cercozoa and chlorophyta the metazoans were dominated by mollusca arthropoda annelida and rotifera in both january and october the relative abundance of cryptophyceae significantly increased in the reservoir and downstream regions the lefse results of the eukaryotic community fig 3b indicated that the otus enriched in the reservoir and downstream regions were almost all phototrophs including cryptomonas thalassiosira and skeletonema the otus enriched upstream were mostly predators and mixotrophs such as poterioochromonas we also calculated the cohesion and ecological network topological parameters of the eukaryotic community results showed that the absolute values of positive and negative cohesions were higher in upstream eukaryotic communities than in reservoir and downstream regions in both january and october fig 3c table s4 so were network average connectivity average clustering coefficient and density table s5 eukaryotic community stability was significantly lower upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions in january and october fig s7 table s4 similarly network modularity was higher in the reservoir in january and october table s5 thus these findings indicate that the upstream eukaryotic community exhibited more complex interactions but less stability 3 3 potential ecological interactions between eukaryotes and prokaryotes we constructed bipartite networks between prokaryotes and eukaryotes to disentangle differences in potential ecological interactions among trophic levels within aquatic food webs in different regions fig 4 a f we further calculated the corresponding network topological and structural indices table s6 results showed significant differences in network properties among the three regions there were fewer network nodes upstream than in the reservoir in january and october but average degree connection and cluster coefficients were higher in the upstream network than in the reservoir and downstream networks in both january and october in addition results showed that the upstream eukaryotic prokaryotic network was smaller and more clustered and the microbial taxa were more closely associated with each other higher eukaryotic and prokaryotic robustness was observed in the upstream network table s6 suggesting that interactions between eukaryotes and prokaryotes were resistant and stable upstream based on their topological roles keystone taxa were identified from the six networks including 343 connector hubs 56 module hubs and 20 network hubs fig s8 regardless of their role table s7 the number of keystone otus in the upstream network was consistently lower than in the reservoir and downstream networks in january and october remarkably 95 of network hubs were eukaryotes belonging to predators or phototrophs given that predators in microbial communities can transfer material and energy to higher trophic levels we extracted subnetworks from predatory eukaryotes and prokaryotes fig 4a1 f1 in all predatory eukaryote and prokaryote networks the percentage of negative links decreased from upstream to downstream in both months fig s9 january 56 to 43 october 64 to 48 indicating a decrease in predation pressure from upstream to downstream spirotrichea predators affiliated with ciliophora were present in all networks and were observed in the largest number in all subnetworks they also interacted most extensively with prokaryotes in all subnetworks 3 4 contribution of dam construction to planktonic community composition and keystone microbes to explore the influence of various factors on the distribution of planktonic microbial communities in the upstream and downstream regions noncollinear environmental variables and spatial variables represented as pcnm were used for vpa results showed that spatial variables or the interaction of environmental and spatial variables were the most important factors driving microbial community assembly fig 5 a however in both january and october at least 45 of the variation in the eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbial communities remained unexplained we therefore conducted sem analysis to quantify the effects of the dam on the microbial communities fig 5b results showed that the direct shaping effect of the dam on prokaryotic and eukaryotic shannon diversity was strongest in january b 0 38 and b 0 63 respectively in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes diversity directly affected the composition of their respective microbial communities in contrast spatial and environmental variables had little direct or indirect impact on microbial communities in october the dam shaped microbial composition directly rather than diversity similarly the effects of spatial and environmental variables on microbial communities were almost negligible consistent with the vpa results notably the prokaryotic microbial communities significantly influenced the eukaryotic microbial communities in both january and october the composition of prokaryotes largely dominated the diversity and composition of the eukaryotic microbial community overall the variables explained 75 90 and 86 91 of the variation in the prokaryotic eukaryotic communities in january and october respectively we explored the influence of the dam on prokaryote eukaryote bipartite networks we used lmms to test the effects of the dam environmental variables and spatial variables on network hubs by comparing effect sizes the dam showed dominant effects of keystone taxa 56 compared to environmental variables fig 5c 3 5 characterization of microbial community food web functional structure and associated ecosystem processes we further analyzed the components of the food web in the planktonic ecosystem the relative abundance of microeukaryotic predators was much higher in the upstream region than in the reservoir and downstream sites in january and october with a decrease of 36 and 22 from upstream to the reservoir respectively fig s10a table s9 the relative abundance of hb showed a similar trend fig s10b table s9 the relative abundance of microeukaryotic predators was also positively correlated with the relative abundance of hb in the reservoir and downstream regions but not in the upstream region fig s11 we used the ratio of microeukaryotic predators to hb to represent trophic transfer efficiency and found that the ratio was higher upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions fig s12 table s9 these results indicate that the dam changed the predator prey relationship in the microbial food web and reduced the efficiency of nutrient transfer in the reservoir to understand how changes in microbial composition and networks affect microbial community functional structure and associated ecosystem processes we performed three analyses first the nmds results showed significant differences in microbial functions among the different regions in january and october fig s13 as confirmed by anosim january r 0 6119 p 0 001 october r 0 7411 p 0 001 secondly psbo gene abundance was determined to estimate relative phytoplankton cell abundance fig 6 a as phytoplankton are responsible for considerable primary production in aquatic ecosystems and have an enormous impact on food webs field et al 1998 results showed that psbo abundance was significantly higher in the reservoir and downstream regions than in the upstream region finally using metagenomic data against the kegg database we found significantly higher enrichment of the carbohydrate metabolic pathways in the upstream region than in the reservoir and downstream regions fig 6b table s10 these findings suggest that the dam enhanced the photoautotrophs and decreased potential heterotrophic respiration in the reservoir and downstream regions 4 discussion in this study we demonstrated that dam induced changes in hydraulic conditions altered microbial community composition and predator prey interactions resulting in altered primary production and heterotrophic respiration of the microbial communities 4 1 impact of dam on planktonic and eukaryotic community structure we found no significant difference in prokaryotic and eukaryotic alpha diversity between the upstream and reservoir regions in january and october but prokaryotic and eukaryotic alpha diversities were lower in the upstream and reservoir regions than downstream in january fig s2 and fig s5 previous studies have also confirmed that microbial diversity increases downstream of dams lu et al 2022 wang et al 2021 one possible reason is that upstream and reservoir areas face greater disturbance than downstream regions for example relatively high discharge and velocity conditions may occur upstream resulting in frequent changes in the reservoir water level and higher stress on planktonic microbial communities in october eukaryotic alpha diversity was higher downstream than upstream while prokaryotic alpha diversity was lower downstream than upstream this inconsistency between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial diversity may be due to the position of prokaryotes at the base of the ecosystem and their rapid change in dynamics in the face of environmental change meinhard et al 2002 our results also showed that microbial community composition was shaped by the dam with significant differences found among the three regions bacteroidetes showed higher relative abundance upstream while actinobacteria and acidobacteria showed higher relative abundance in the reservoir and downstream regions fig 2a fig s3 these findings are consistent with previous studies showing similar patterns in dam affected rivers li et al 2022a wang et al 2018b bacteroidetes are considered r strategists and opportunists weinbauer and hofle 1998 exploiting available resources and growing rapidly in upstream river areas thus colonizing new environments where competition levels may be low read et al 2015 in contrast k strategist bacteria such as actinobacteria and acidobacteria are more competitive but exhibit lower growth rates and narrower ecological niches and are thus more likely to survive in reservoirs and downstream areas experiencing sediment deposition and slow flow velocities read et al 2015 yang et al 2022b previous studies on the effects of dams on river planktonic eukaryotes have reported that the relative abundances of cryptophyceae and alveolata significantly increase downstream of dams li et al 2022a lu et al 2020 our results showed that many eukaryotes with higher relative abundance in the upstream region were predators e g ciliophora choanoflagellida and cercozoa whereas eukaryotes with relatively high relative abundance in the reservoir and downstream regions were phototrophs e g bacillariophyta cryptophyceae and chlorophyceae this may be due to dam regulation resulting in reduced flow velocity and increased hydraulic retention time yang et al 2017 which may increase nutrient retention thereby favoring the reproduction of phototrophic eukaryotes in reservoirs wang et al 2018a changes in hydraulic conditions caused by dams inevitably alter microbial interactions cruaud et al 2019 consistent with previous results lu et al 2022 our study showed that the reservoir microbial community exhibited lower connectivity and complexity and higher stability according to cohesion and network topological parameters figs 2c 3c s4 and s7 tables s3 s4 and s5 indicating that dams may diminish taxon connectedness and biotic interactions interactions across trophic levels also dramatically shifted fig 4 table s6 the relatively low prokaryotic and eukaryotic robustness in the reservoir and downstream networks indicated that the interactions between eukaryotes and prokaryotes were not resistant to dam induced changes in hydraulic conditions suggesting that the reservoir and downstream areas may be at risk of ecological collapse notably reservoirs are prone to eutrophication and algal blooms under the influence of water conservancy and hydropower projects chen et al 2018 maavara et al 2020 4 2 impact of dam on predator prey interactions in the food web predator prey relationships in microbial food webs are determined by simultaneous top down and bottom up effects in this study the subnetworks extracted from predatory eukaryotes and prokaryotes showed a decrease in the proportion of negative connections from upstream to downstream suggesting reduced predator to prey pressure in the river ecosystem the relative abundance of microeukaryotic predators and hb in the food web was also lower in the reservoir than in the upstream and downstream regions fig s10 as also reported in other studies guasto et al 2012 yang et al 2020 this may be related to changes in water velocity caused by dam construction in marine intertidal communities greater predator density occurs at high flow sites than at low flow sites leonard et al 1998 high velocity also increases the daily integrated feeding of the ciliate community by a factor of 3 2 compared to still waters shimeta et al 2001 high water residence time caused by dam impoundment can also limit hb growth domingues et al 2017 a positive relationship between predation pressure and prey is often reported gauzens et al 2016 worm et al 2002 but negative effects have also been documented terborgh 2015 in our study there was no correlation between the relative abundance of microeukaryotic predators and hb upstream but there was a positive correlation in the reservoir and downstream regions thus even though upstream predation pressure is high upstream bacterial communities may be influenced more from the bottom up than from the top down by predators this may be related to differences in hydraulic conditions and water quality among the upstream downstream and reservoir regions several studies have shown that the relative effects of predation and competition on bacterial survival depend on nutrient levels corno and jürgens 2008 hiltunen and laakso 2013 with predation being the most important factor regulating bacterial biomass in eutrophic environments and competition being a more important factor in oligotrophic environments gasol et al 2002 matz and jürgens 2003 pernthaler 2005 in addition actinobacteria are generally free living ultramicrobacteria that can avoid grazing hahn et al 2003 whereas bacteroidetes species are vulnerable to predation salcher et al 2005 the succession from a bacteroidetes to actinobacteria dominated community from the headwaters to downstream may be related to higher levels of top down predation in the lower reaches read et al 2015 however our study suggests another possible explanation under higher predation pressure upstream actinobacteria reproduction decreased to resist predation while opportunistic bacteroidetes proliferated notably several studies have reported tradeoffs between reproductive capacity and survivability to resist grazing from predation bohannan et al 2002 li et al 2022b 4 3 impact of dam on aquatic ecosystem functions the hydraulic conditions changed by dam construction may ultimately affect key ecological processes such as primary production carbon flux and nutrient cycling palmer and ruhi 2019 in our study primary production represented by the abundance of psbo was lower whereas heterotrophic respiration represented by the abundance of the microbial carbon cycle pathway was higher upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions fig 6a moreover nutrient delivery efficiency was higher upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions these results are consistent with previous research showing that microbial food web components contribute significantly to the carbon cycle in systems with low primary production domingues et al 2017 our results also demonstrated dam induced ecosystem shifts at the functional level from a riverine lotic system to a lacustrine static system correspondingly planktonic microbial ecosystems gradually shifted from brown detritus based food webs to green autotrophic based food webs lu et al 2020 wang et al 2018a yang et al 2022a however our findings should be interpreted in the context of study limitations while we calculated the extent to which the dam affected the planktonic microbial community we did not determine exactly which process was dominant in addition while network analysis inferred the existence of species interactions we could not distinguish interaction types 5 conclusions we evaluated the impact of a dam on planktonic prokaryotes and eukaryotes based on metagenomic sequencing our results showed that unique microbial communities formed upstream and downstream of the dam as well as in the reservoir itself the lefse results showed that r strategy bacteria such as bacteroidetes were more likely to survive upstream of the dam however conditions in the reservoir and downstream regions were more conducive for the survival of k strategy bacteria such as actinobacteria eukaryotic predators tended to be enriched upstream while phototrophs tended to be enriched in the reservoir and downstream regions the dam resulted in a reduction in the complexity and an increase in the stability of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in the reservoir subnetworks between predatory eukaryotes and prokaryotes indicated that while the reservoir and downstream networks were more complex they showed a reduced proportion of negative interactions representing predation vpa sem and lmms further indicated that the dam was the key factor affecting microbial community composition rather than the physicochemical properties of water or spatial variables the abundance of the psbo gene was lower and the abundance of the microbial carbon cycle pathway was higher upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions these results support the concept that dams gradually induce transformation from detritus based food webs to autotrophic based food webs in

functional traits of multi trophic microbiota can be altered by dam construction which may result in changes in aquatic predator prey interactions to understand this process we performed a large scale

deposited in the china national center for bioinformation database https www cncb ac cn under accession numbers cra008231 and cra006054 2 3 bioinformatics analysis of sequences to identify prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa we extracted small subunit ribosomal rna ssu rrna gene 16s and 18s rrna genes fragments from the filtered clean reads using metaxa2 bengtsson palme et al 2015 the recovered 16s and 18s fragments were clustered to generate an operational taxonomic unit otu table using usearch v10 0 240 edgar 2018 taxonomic classification was performed against the silva 132 database quast et al 2013 and protist ribosomal reference database pr2 v4 13 0 guillou et al 2013 using uclust at a similarity of 97 in qiime v1 9 1 kuczynski et al 2011 alpha and beta diversity indices were calculated in qiime for convenience we referred to the assessed communities as microbial communities although they also included microscopic fauna to characterize the microbial food web pattern we divided bacteria into two functional groups i e autotrophic cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria excluding cyanobacteria yang et al 2018 heterotrophic bacteria hb were considered as prey in microbial food web analysis we further assigned the eukaryotic otus into different functional groups based on feeding mode guo et al 2021 xiong et al 2019 i e phototrophs predators parasites and saprotrophs the photosynthetic gene psbo was used as a proxy for relative cell abundance across the whole phytoplankton community to provide insight into photosynthesis the psbo gene profile in each sample was calculated by aligning the clean shotgun metagenomic sequencing reads to a curated database of 18 000 annotated psbo sequences pierella karlusich et al 2022 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg carbohydrate metabolic pathways were determined by functional annotation in eggnog mapper v5 0 to evaluate microbial heterotrophic respiration huerta cepas et al 2019 details are provided in text s3 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed in r v4 1 1 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was performed using the vegan package v2 5 7 in r analysis of similarity anosim was performed to test differences in prokaryotic and microeukaryotic composition using the vegan package linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was applied to identify differentially abundant taxa which were visualized using the metacoder r package v 0 3 5 foster et al 2017 further details are provided in text s4 all other data visualization tasks were performed using ggplot2 package v3 3 6 to quantify the degree of microbial community connectivity we used the recently developed cohesion framework herren and mcmahon 2017 as described in text s5 we obtained two metrics of cohesion i e positive cohesion reflecting the degree of cooperative behaviors in a sample and negative cohesion indicating the magnitude of competitive behaviors among community members community stability was expressed as the ratio of the absolute value of negative cohesion to positive cohesion molecular ecological networks mens and inter domain ecological networks idens were constructed to determine potential microbial interactions analyses were conducted using the integrated network analysis pipeline inap http mem rcees ac cn 8081 feng et al 2022 including the molecular ecological network analysis mena pipeline and inter domain ecological network analysis pipeline idenap details are described in text s6 networks were visualized in gephi v0 9 2 variance partitioning analysis vpa was used to evaluate the relative contributions of environmental variables physicochemical properties of water reflecting limited environmental selection and spatial variables reflecting spatial autocorrelation in shaping microbial communities using the vegan package v2 5 7 in r spatial variables were expressed using the principal coordinates of neighbor matrices pcnm in r with the vegan package structural equation models sems were used to explore direct and indirect relationships among all variables envisaged in the model using the lavaan package in r rosseel 2012 the experimental data were not completely independent due to repeated measurements for every city in the three dam partitioned regions therefore linear mixed effects models lmms were used to assess the effects of dams on network hubs the lme4 r package was used to implement lmms bates et al 2015 details are described in text s7 3 results 3 1 prokaryotic community composition and coherence we first analyzed the compositional traits of planktonic prokaryotes in the upstream reservoir and downstream sites no significant differences in the alpha diversity indices including shannon chao1 simpson and pd whole tree of planktonic prokaryotes were found between the upstream and reservoir areas however the alpha diversity indices were higher downstream than upstream in january but lower in october fig s2 and table s1 the nmds results showed obvious prokaryotic community clustering in the different regions upstream reservoir and downstream in january and october fig 2 a as confirmed by anosim january r 0 8464 p 0 001 october r 0 7186 p 0 001 in terms of prokaryotic community composition the abundances of actinobacteria and acidobacteria markedly increased in the reservoir and downstream regions while bacteroidetes abundance significantly decreased in january and october fig s3 fig 2b cohesion and ecological networks were used to quantify the degree of connectivity complexity and stability of the ecological communities in both january and october the absolute values of positive and negative cohesion of the prokaryotic communities were lower in the reservoir than in the upstream region fig 2c table s3 average connectivity clustering coefficient and density were also higher upstream than in the reservoir in both january and october table s5 prokaryotic community stability defined as the absolute value of negative cohesion positive cohesion hernandez et al 2021 was significantly higher in the reservoir than downstream in january and was significantly higher in the reservoir than upstream in october fig s4 table s3 network modularity showed a similar trend table s5 overall cohesion and network topological parameter analyses indicated that the reservoir prokaryotic community had lower connectivity and complexity but higher stability than upstream 3 2 eukaryotic community composition and coherence the alpha diversity indices of the planktonic eukaryotic community were higher downstream than in the reservoir and upstream regions in january and october but there was no significant difference between the reservoir and upstream regions fig s5 table s2 similarly the nmds results fig 3 a indicated that eukaryotic communities formed obvious geographic clusters in the different regions in both january and october as confirmed by anosim january r 0 5721 p 0 001 october r 0 5441 p 0 001 the eukaryotic communities were mainly comprised of protists metazoans and fungi fig s6 the protists were dominated by ochrophyta cryptophyta ciliophora cercozoa and chlorophyta the metazoans were dominated by mollusca arthropoda annelida and rotifera in both january and october the relative abundance of cryptophyceae significantly increased in the reservoir and downstream regions the lefse results of the eukaryotic community fig 3b indicated that the otus enriched in the reservoir and downstream regions were almost all phototrophs including cryptomonas thalassiosira and skeletonema the otus enriched upstream were mostly predators and mixotrophs such as poterioochromonas we also calculated the cohesion and ecological network topological parameters of the eukaryotic community results showed that the absolute values of positive and negative cohesions were higher in upstream eukaryotic communities than in reservoir and downstream regions in both january and october fig 3c table s4 so were network average connectivity average clustering coefficient and density table s5 eukaryotic community stability was significantly lower upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions in january and october fig s7 table s4 similarly network modularity was higher in the reservoir in january and october table s5 thus these findings indicate that the upstream eukaryotic community exhibited more complex interactions but less stability 3 3 potential ecological interactions between eukaryotes and prokaryotes we constructed bipartite networks between prokaryotes and eukaryotes to disentangle differences in potential ecological interactions among trophic levels within aquatic food webs in different regions fig 4 a f we further calculated the corresponding network topological and structural indices table s6 results showed significant differences in network properties among the three regions there were fewer network nodes upstream than in the reservoir in january and october but average degree connection and cluster coefficients were higher in the upstream network than in the reservoir and downstream networks in both january and october in addition results showed that the upstream eukaryotic prokaryotic network was smaller and more clustered and the microbial taxa were more closely associated with each other higher eukaryotic and prokaryotic robustness was observed in the upstream network table s6 suggesting that interactions between eukaryotes and prokaryotes were resistant and stable upstream based on their topological roles keystone taxa were identified from the six networks including 343 connector hubs 56 module hubs and 20 network hubs fig s8 regardless of their role table s7 the number of keystone otus in the upstream network was consistently lower than in the reservoir and downstream networks in january and october remarkably 95 of network hubs were eukaryotes belonging to predators or phototrophs given that predators in microbial communities can transfer material and energy to higher trophic levels we extracted subnetworks from predatory eukaryotes and prokaryotes fig 4a1 f1 in all predatory eukaryote and prokaryote networks the percentage of negative links decreased from upstream to downstream in both months fig s9 january 56 to 43 october 64 to 48 indicating a decrease in predation pressure from upstream to downstream spirotrichea predators affiliated with ciliophora were present in all networks and were observed in the largest number in all subnetworks they also interacted most extensively with prokaryotes in all subnetworks 3 4 contribution of dam construction to planktonic community composition and keystone microbes to explore the influence of various factors on the distribution of planktonic microbial communities in the upstream and downstream regions noncollinear environmental variables and spatial variables represented as pcnm were used for vpa results showed that spatial variables or the interaction of environmental and spatial variables were the most important factors driving microbial community assembly fig 5 a however in both january and october at least 45 of the variation in the eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbial communities remained unexplained we therefore conducted sem analysis to quantify the effects of the dam on the microbial communities fig 5b results showed that the direct shaping effect of the dam on prokaryotic and eukaryotic shannon diversity was strongest in january b 0 38 and b 0 63 respectively in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes diversity directly affected the composition of their respective microbial communities in contrast spatial and environmental variables had little direct or indirect impact on microbial communities in october the dam shaped microbial composition directly rather than diversity similarly the effects of spatial and environmental variables on microbial communities were almost negligible consistent with the vpa results notably the prokaryotic microbial communities significantly influenced the eukaryotic microbial communities in both january and october the composition of prokaryotes largely dominated the diversity and composition of the eukaryotic microbial community overall the variables explained 75 90 and 86 91 of the variation in the prokaryotic eukaryotic communities in january and october respectively we explored the influence of the dam on prokaryote eukaryote bipartite networks we used lmms to test the effects of the dam environmental variables and spatial variables on network hubs by comparing effect sizes the dam showed dominant effects of keystone taxa 56 compared to environmental variables fig 5c 3 5 characterization of microbial community food web functional structure and associated ecosystem processes we further analyzed the components of the food web in the planktonic ecosystem the relative abundance of microeukaryotic predators was much higher in the upstream region than in the reservoir and downstream sites in january and october with a decrease of 36 and 22 from upstream to the reservoir respectively fig s10a table s9 the relative abundance of hb showed a similar trend fig s10b table s9 the relative abundance of microeukaryotic predators was also positively correlated with the relative abundance of hb in the reservoir and downstream regions but not in the upstream region fig s11 we used the ratio of microeukaryotic predators to hb to represent trophic transfer efficiency and found that the ratio was higher upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions fig s12 table s9 these results indicate that the dam changed the predator prey relationship in the microbial food web and reduced the efficiency of nutrient transfer in the reservoir to understand how changes in microbial composition and networks affect microbial community functional structure and associated ecosystem processes we performed three analyses first the nmds results showed significant differences in microbial functions among the different regions in january and october fig s13 as confirmed by anosim january r 0 6119 p 0 001 october r 0 7411 p 0 001 secondly psbo gene abundance was determined to estimate relative phytoplankton cell abundance fig 6 a as phytoplankton are responsible for considerable primary production in aquatic ecosystems and have an enormous impact on food webs field et al 1998 results showed that psbo abundance was significantly higher in the reservoir and downstream regions than in the upstream region finally using metagenomic data against the kegg database we found significantly higher enrichment of the carbohydrate metabolic pathways in the upstream region than in the reservoir and downstream regions fig 6b table s10 these findings suggest that the dam enhanced the photoautotrophs and decreased potential heterotrophic respiration in the reservoir and downstream regions 4 discussion in this study we demonstrated that dam induced changes in hydraulic conditions altered microbial community composition and predator prey interactions resulting in altered primary production and heterotrophic respiration of the microbial communities 4 1 impact of dam on planktonic and eukaryotic community structure we found no significant difference in prokaryotic and eukaryotic alpha diversity between the upstream and reservoir regions in january and october but prokaryotic and eukaryotic alpha diversities were lower in the upstream and reservoir regions than downstream in january fig s2 and fig s5 previous studies have also confirmed that microbial diversity increases downstream of dams lu et al 2022 wang et al 2021 one possible reason is that upstream and reservoir areas face greater disturbance than downstream regions for example relatively high discharge and velocity conditions may occur upstream resulting in frequent changes in the reservoir water level and higher stress on planktonic microbial communities in october eukaryotic alpha diversity was higher downstream than upstream while prokaryotic alpha diversity was lower downstream than upstream this inconsistency between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial diversity may be due to the position of prokaryotes at the base of the ecosystem and their rapid change in dynamics in the face of environmental change meinhard et al 2002 our results also showed that microbial community composition was shaped by the dam with significant differences found among the three regions bacteroidetes showed higher relative abundance upstream while actinobacteria and acidobacteria showed higher relative abundance in the reservoir and downstream regions fig 2a fig s3 these findings are consistent with previous studies showing similar patterns in dam affected rivers li et al 2022a wang et al 2018b bacteroidetes are considered r strategists and opportunists weinbauer and hofle 1998 exploiting available resources and growing rapidly in upstream river areas thus colonizing new environments where competition levels may be low read et al 2015 in contrast k strategist bacteria such as actinobacteria and acidobacteria are more competitive but exhibit lower growth rates and narrower ecological niches and are thus more likely to survive in reservoirs and downstream areas experiencing sediment deposition and slow flow velocities read et al 2015 yang et al 2022b previous studies on the effects of dams on river planktonic eukaryotes have reported that the relative abundances of cryptophyceae and alveolata significantly increase downstream of dams li et al 2022a lu et al 2020 our results showed that many eukaryotes with higher relative abundance in the upstream region were predators e g ciliophora choanoflagellida and cercozoa whereas eukaryotes with relatively high relative abundance in the reservoir and downstream regions were phototrophs e g bacillariophyta cryptophyceae and chlorophyceae this may be due to dam regulation resulting in reduced flow velocity and increased hydraulic retention time yang et al 2017 which may increase nutrient retention thereby favoring the reproduction of phototrophic eukaryotes in reservoirs wang et al 2018a changes in hydraulic conditions caused by dams inevitably alter microbial interactions cruaud et al 2019 consistent with previous results lu et al 2022 our study showed that the reservoir microbial community exhibited lower connectivity and complexity and higher stability according to cohesion and network topological parameters figs 2c 3c s4 and s7 tables s3 s4 and s5 indicating that dams may diminish taxon connectedness and biotic interactions interactions across trophic levels also dramatically shifted fig 4 table s6 the relatively low prokaryotic and eukaryotic robustness in the reservoir and downstream networks indicated that the interactions between eukaryotes and prokaryotes were not resistant to dam induced changes in hydraulic conditions suggesting that the reservoir and downstream areas may be at risk of ecological collapse notably reservoirs are prone to eutrophication and algal blooms under the influence of water conservancy and hydropower projects chen et al 2018 maavara et al 2020 4 2 impact of dam on predator prey interactions in the food web predator prey relationships in microbial food webs are determined by simultaneous top down and bottom up effects in this study the subnetworks extracted from predatory eukaryotes and prokaryotes showed a decrease in the proportion of negative connections from upstream to downstream suggesting reduced predator to prey pressure in the river ecosystem the relative abundance of microeukaryotic predators and hb in the food web was also lower in the reservoir than in the upstream and downstream regions fig s10 as also reported in other studies guasto et al 2012 yang et al 2020 this may be related to changes in water velocity caused by dam construction in marine intertidal communities greater predator density occurs at high flow sites than at low flow sites leonard et al 1998 high velocity also increases the daily integrated feeding of the ciliate community by a factor of 3 2 compared to still waters shimeta et al 2001 high water residence time caused by dam impoundment can also limit hb growth domingues et al 2017 a positive relationship between predation pressure and prey is often reported gauzens et al 2016 worm et al 2002 but negative effects have also been documented terborgh 2015 in our study there was no correlation between the relative abundance of microeukaryotic predators and hb upstream but there was a positive correlation in the reservoir and downstream regions thus even though upstream predation pressure is high upstream bacterial communities may be influenced more from the bottom up than from the top down by predators this may be related to differences in hydraulic conditions and water quality among the upstream downstream and reservoir regions several studies have shown that the relative effects of predation and competition on bacterial survival depend on nutrient levels corno and jürgens 2008 hiltunen and laakso 2013 with predation being the most important factor regulating bacterial biomass in eutrophic environments and competition being a more important factor in oligotrophic environments gasol et al 2002 matz and jürgens 2003 pernthaler 2005 in addition actinobacteria are generally free living ultramicrobacteria that can avoid grazing hahn et al 2003 whereas bacteroidetes species are vulnerable to predation salcher et al 2005 the succession from a bacteroidetes to actinobacteria dominated community from the headwaters to downstream may be related to higher levels of top down predation in the lower reaches read et al 2015 however our study suggests another possible explanation under higher predation pressure upstream actinobacteria reproduction decreased to resist predation while opportunistic bacteroidetes proliferated notably several studies have reported tradeoffs between reproductive capacity and survivability to resist grazing from predation bohannan et al 2002 li et al 2022b 4 3 impact of dam on aquatic ecosystem functions the hydraulic conditions changed by dam construction may ultimately affect key ecological processes such as primary production carbon flux and nutrient cycling palmer and ruhi 2019 in our study primary production represented by the abundance of psbo was lower whereas heterotrophic respiration represented by the abundance of the microbial carbon cycle pathway was higher upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions fig 6a moreover nutrient delivery efficiency was higher upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions these results are consistent with previous research showing that microbial food web components contribute significantly to the carbon cycle in systems with low primary production domingues et al 2017 our results also demonstrated dam induced ecosystem shifts at the functional level from a riverine lotic system to a lacustrine static system correspondingly planktonic microbial ecosystems gradually shifted from brown detritus based food webs to green autotrophic based food webs lu et al 2020 wang et al 2018a yang et al 2022a however our findings should be interpreted in the context of study limitations while we calculated the extent to which the dam affected the planktonic microbial community we did not determine exactly which process was dominant in addition while network analysis inferred the existence of species interactions we could not distinguish interaction types 5 conclusions we evaluated the impact of a dam on planktonic prokaryotes and eukaryotes based on metagenomic sequencing our results showed that unique microbial communities formed upstream and downstream of the dam as well as in the reservoir itself the lefse results showed that r strategy bacteria such as bacteroidetes were more likely to survive upstream of the dam however conditions in the reservoir and downstream regions were more conducive for the survival of k strategy bacteria such as actinobacteria eukaryotic predators tended to be enriched upstream while phototrophs tended to be enriched in the reservoir and downstream regions the dam resulted in a reduction in the complexity and an increase in the stability of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in the reservoir subnetworks between predatory eukaryotes and prokaryotes indicated that while the reservoir and downstream networks were more complex they showed a reduced proportion of negative interactions representing predation vpa sem and lmms further indicated that the dam was the key factor affecting microbial community composition rather than the physicochemical properties of water or spatial variables the abundance of the psbo gene was lower and the abundance of the microbial carbon cycle pathway was higher upstream than in the reservoir and downstream regions these results support the concept that dams gradually induce transformation from detritus based food webs to autotrophic based food webs in

15166,the growing applications of cuo nanoparticles nps in industrial and agriculture has increased their concentrations in wastewater and subsequently accumulated in waste activated sludge was raising concerns about their impact on reutilization of was especially on the medium chain carboxylates mccs production from anaerobic fermentation of was here we showed that cuo nps at 10 50 mg g ts can significantly inhibit mccs production and reactive oxygen species generation was revealed to be the key factor linked to the phenomena at lower cuo nps concentrations 0 5 2 5 mg g ts however mccs production was enhanced with a maximum level of 37 compared to the control the combination of molecular approaches and metaproteomic analysis revealed that although low dosage cuo nps 2 5 mg g ts weakly inhibited chain elongation process they displayed contributive characteristics both in was solubilization and transport metabolism of carbohydrate these results demonstrated that the complex microbial processes for mccs production in the anaerobic fermentation of was can be affected by cuo nps in a dosage dependent manner via regulating microbial protein expression level our findings can provide new insights into the influence of cuo nps on anaerobic fermentation process and shed light on the treatment option for the resource utilization of cuo nps polluted was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation cuo nanoparticles medium chain carboxylate metaproteomic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rapid innovation and commercialization of nanotechnology large amounts of nanoparticles nps have been incorporated into consumer and industrial products particularly as a p type semiconductor cuo nps were produced world widely at a dosage of 570 t in 2014 and would be 1600 t by the year 2025 hou et al 2017 due to the unique physicochemical properties cuo nps have been widely used in various fields such as industrial catalysis and sustainable agriculture otero gonzález et al 2014 ingle 2021 the large production and widespread utilization of cuo nps can lead to their environmental release and accumulation in fact cuo np are commonly found in different environmental media and matrices e g polluted sludge and water particularly waste activated sludge was is considered as a reservoir for cuo nps accumulation since many of nps ultimately enter the wastewater treatment plants wwtp and concentrated in was kiser et al 2010 limbach et al 2008 for instance the content of cuo nps in sludge is estimated to be approximately 2 5 mg g of total solids ts according to the sample collected worldwide abdulsada et al 2021 mu et al 2011 and the value can be higher in china as the concentration of cu in 193 sludge samples was detected to be about 908 4 mg kg 1 tou et al 2017 furthermore a much greater level of cuo nps may be measured in the near future considering their increasing production and use cuo nps have been reported to exhibit diverse adverse effects on individual organisms by causing oxidative stress cell membrane disruption and inactivation of key enzymes gonzalez estrella et al 2013 tian et al 2017 therefore treatment and resource utilization of the large amount of was also faces risk posed by cuo nps anaerobic conversion occurred in a syntrophic microbial community has been strategically used as a cost effective method to achieve simultaneously was reduction and valuable end products production methane ch4 hydrogen h2 short chain carboxylates sccs mainly c2 c5 carboxylic acids are the common products of anaerobic was fermentation whereas medium chain carboxylates mccs is emerged recently as a class of novel product with a higher utilization value as it carries more energy and has better separability as a type of fatty acid that contain 6 to 12 carbon atoms mccs can be produced through sccs upgrading accompanying with electron donors e g ethanol by carboxylate platform in anaerobic reactor the pivotal biochemical reactions for these bioproducts generation in anaerobic reactor involve solubilization hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation methanogenesis wu et al 2020b the solubilization step has been considered the bottleneck of was anaerobic conversion as most organic content such as carbohydrates and proteins is enclosed inside the microbial cell membranes zheng et al 2014 this soluble organic matter should be released and accessed by hydrolytic bacteria to produce polymers and monomers yang et al 2020 subsequently acidogenic bacteria metabolize the polymer and monomers to yield sccs especially acetate for further mccs or ch4 synthesis conducted by chain elongation microbe or methanogens respectively angenent et al 2016 in this regard the variation of operated conditions can induce the dissimilarities in any aforementioned reactions liu and ghosh 1997 zheng et al 2014 although experimental setups could influence mccs production from was the characteristic of was such as its composition is regarded as the foundational and key factor influencing the fermentation performance liu et al 2012 wang et al 2020a cuo nps as an accumulated material in was can potentially affect functional microbial groups and catalytic reaction activity for was anaerobic conversion therefore it is worth investigating the effect of cuo np on mccs generation and then providing information for further study to improve mccs production and shorten fermentation duration in case of some particle occurrence in the experimental sludge like most other syntrophic communities it should be emphasized that the anaerobic conversion could not only be influenced by the activity of individual microorganisms but also the syntrophic community it has been reported that the negative effect of cuo nps on ch4 production was mainly attributed to their inhibition on methanogenesis ajay et al 2020 chen et al 2020 however a recent report by wei et al 2021 suggested that cuo at 5 mg g ts significantly promoted h2 production due to the enhanced was solubilization these studies revealed that the effect of cuo nps on the anaerobic fermentation are greatly influenced by the unique biological process required for the production of each product however a comprehensive understanding of mccs production in was anaerobic fermentation influenced by cuo nps is lacking such as how does cuo np dosage in was impact its anaerobic fermentation what is the mechanism of the effect of cuo nps on various processes involved in mcc generation besides only microbial community composition was used to explore the mechanisms behind the effect of cuo nps on anaerobic conversion process which was still not convincible huang et al 2019 luna delrisco et al 2011 wang et al 2017 in this study we explored the potential effects of cuo nps on mccs production from was anaerobic fermentation and the underlying mechanisms based on molecular approaches and label free quantitative proteomic analysis as a quantitative metaproteomic technology label free quantitative proteomic analysis could provides direct proof on the expressed genes and quantify the key proteins from multiple differential samples associated with various operations abram et al 2011 lü et al 2014 the current study will focus on 1 systematically exploring the dosage response relationship between cuo nps and mccs production and the involved each step 2 identification the contribution of generated intracellular reactive oxygen species ros released ions as well as disturbed electron transfer activity to the change of mccs yield and 3 revealing the possible mechanism for the production of mccs in the presence of cuo nps from protein and genes aspects this study is expected to contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the impact of cuo nps on was anaerobic fermentation through complex microbial process and provide important clues for resource utilization of cuo nps containing sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum was and cuo nps the inoculum used in this study was derived from a well characterized reactor with an operating period of more than one year fed with was and ethanol to produce mccs the characteristics of the inoculum were as follows total solid ts 21 3 0 7 g l volatile solid vs 16 9 1 1 g l

present study was purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china the transmission electron microscopy tem image of cuo nps was obtained using a fei talos f200s hillsboro or usa using a voltage of 200 kv to visualize their shape and particle size 40 nm fig s1 si 2 2 effects of cuo nps on the mccs production from was the experiments were conducted in 150 ml serum bottles with working volume of 70 ml 20 ml of inoculum and 50 ml of was together with 300 mm c ethanol for mccs potential tests and the concentration of ethanol as electron donor was determined according to previous studies wang et al 2020b wu et al 2018 one reactor was labeled as the control without cuo nps addition while the other four reactors were dosage with cuo nps 0 464 2 464 9 964 and 49 964 mg g ts to the final concentrations of 0 5 2 5 10 and 50 mg g ts based on the initial cuo nps in was in addition the reactors with only inoculum and basic anaerobic medium ba medium were used as negative controls the detailed composition of ba medium was described in our previous study yang et al 2019 all reactors were performed in triplicates and lasted for 34 days the ph was adjusted to 7 in all the reactors by adding 4 m naoh and 4 m hcl 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes 100 mm was added initially to inhibit methanogens the above reactors were flushed with n2 for 5 min to create an anaerobic environment sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and then placed in a 35 c incubator with a shaking speed of 150 rpm the electron transport system ets activity analysis and ros production were also evaluated according to the reference limbach et al 2007 tian et al 2017 in order to explore the influencing mechanism of cuo nps their impacts on four processes solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and chain elongation involved in mccs production were assessed with model substrates supporting information the significance of results was evaluated using the analysis of variance anova and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 2 3 effect of cu2 on the mccs production the effect of cu2 on the mccs production were tested cucl2 instead of cuo nps was injected into the reactors according to the cu2 concentrations determined at the end of cuo nps experiment in section 2 2 the other operation conditions were similar to the cuo nps experiment the mccs concentration were determined after 34 days all the tests were performed in triplicates 2 4 microbial community compositions analyses to characterize time dependent microbial composition changes among inoculum group control group and 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps group the microbial communities in the three groups were analyzed at different operational times samples control 7 control 15 control 30 and control 34 were obtained from reactor c on days 7 15 30 and 34 respectively samples cuo 7 cuo 15 cuo 30 and cuo 34 were obtained from reactor 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps on days 7 15 30 and 34 respectively then the microbial community composition between the control and the 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps exposed fermenter on day 34 at stable state were compared detailedly to gain more insight into how low dosage of cuo nps influenced mccs production detailed information was described in si 2 5 label free quantitative proteomic analyses samples from control group 0 mg cuo g ts and the experimental group 2 5 mg cuo g ts were also collected at the end of the experiment for label free quantitative proteomic analysis the total protein in the samples was extracted and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page and the total protein concentration was determined through the bradford method sengupta et al 2011 0 5 μg μl of the peptide was taken out of each sample for protein identification by liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer mass spectrometer analysis the raw data were processed using peaksstudio version 8 5 against the ncbi database detailed information can be found in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 dosage dependent promotion and suppression of mcc production by cuo nps with ethanol as electron donor the production of carboxylates sccs and mccs from was at different dosages of cuo nps were investigated and shown in fig 1 and fig s2 after operation for 34 days the concentration of carboxylates and microbial community composition in all reactors reached a stationary level fig s3 as the concentrations of n heptanoate and n caprylate were almost negligible 8 mg cod l n caproate was thus considered as the sole mcc product in this study as shown in fig 1 it was clear that cuo nps affect the production of carboxylates and the consumption of ethanol in a dosage dependent manner the production of carboxylates increased significantly with the dosage of cuo nps in the range of 0 2 5 mg g ts and achieved the highest at 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps the generation of mccs and consumption of ethanol displayed similar trend and the maximum mccs concentration achieved 6600 mg cod l at 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps which was 37 higher than that of the untreated control 4800 mg cod l p 0 05 nevertheless the yield of sccs valerate butyrate propionate acetate increased up to a maximum of only 5 7 when cuo nps content was 2 5 mg g ts these results suggested that low cuo nps dosage 2 5 mg g ts could mainly stimulate mccs production from sccs and ethanol angenent et al 2016 with further increase of the cuo nps dosages to 50 mg g ts however the total yield of carboxylates decreased to 45 6 sccs to 52 9 and mccs to 28 of that observed in the control p 0 05 respectively meanwhile the consumption of ethanol decreased to 4600 mg cod l which only correspond to 56 1 of that in the control group overall these results suggested that low cuo nps dosage 2 5 mg g ts addition could lead to significantly enhanced production of mccs from was but extended exposure to cuo nps would cause severe toxicity and inhibition effect to date most previous studies reported the inhibitory effects of cuo nps even at low dosage on the anaerobic microorganisms chen et al 2014b otero gonzález et al 2014 wang et al 2017 different with previous reports our results showed that cuo nps 0 50 mg g ts displayed enhancement to inhibition effect on was anaerobic fermentation for mccs production based on these distinct phenomena it is of great and enlightening significance to explore the mechanisms on anaerobic conversion of was for mccs production under different cuo np stresses which were carried out in the following section 3 2 cuo nps affected each stage of was anaerobic fermentation to better understand the role of cuo nps the effects of cuo nps on key processes i e solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and chain elongation were further conducted as the bottleneck steps of was anaerobic fermentation solubilization is a non bioprocess with the release of soluble substances as the organic matters mainly existed in the solid phase of was liu and fang 2002 therefore the extent of was solubilization could be expressed by the variations of soluble organic matters as shown in fig s4a all dosages of cuo nps addition promoted the release of organic matters with the amount of polysaccharide protein and scod in the bioreactor increased with the increasing cuo nps dosage after initial 2 d fermentation three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was also used to characterize the soluble organic matters in fermentation liquor at different dosage of cuo nps as shown in fig s4 b f the ex em peaks at 250 280 200 380 nm which represented the areas related to the biodegradable soluble substances chen et al 2003 was positively correlated with the dosage of cuo nps similarly the free lactate dehydrogenase ldh and dna associated with the cell membrane integrity also increased fig s4g and was 74 5 and 76 1 higher than that of the control when the cuo nps dosage was up to 50 mg g ts all these results indicated that addition of cuo nps improved solubilization of was and the trend were positively related to cuo nps dosage based on the characteristics of cuo nps three possibilities are proposed to explain the improved was solubilization first as a catalyst cuo np destroys the structure of was to make it easy to mix with water chen et al 2014a also demonstrated that cunps could ruin the layout of sludge and reduce its particle size by environmental scanning electron microscopy analysis second cuo nps improve the interaction between hydrophobic insoluble organic matters mainly protein like substances in was and aqueous solution by its surface reactive property in future research determining the solubility and structure of protein like substances in an abiotic environment and their interactions with cuo nps may verify the hypothesis third partially broken cells in was by cuo nps may cause the release of internal macromolecular organics into the fermentation reactor this has been shown by the sem images and higher released ldh free dna fig s5 and fig s4g the soluble organic matters released from was solubilization would be further biodegraded by the hydrolysis and acidification process and further converted to mccs through chain elongation step the effect of cuo nps on the hydrolysis step was examined using model proteins bovine serum albumin bsa and model polysaccharide dextran fig s6 a showed the degradation efficiency of bsa and dextran at different concentration of cuo nps at dosages of 0 5 and 2 5 mg g ts the influences of cuo nps on degradations of bsa and dextran were both insignificant compared to untreated control however the degradations rate of bsa and dextran at 10 mg g ts of cuo nps were lower than that in the control 9 2 and 39 versus 24 5 and 81 1 respectively and the lowest degradations rate of both molecules was obtained at 50 mg g ts of cuo nps took only 17 9 and 24 8 of the control respectively fig s6 a illustrated similar result for the acidogenesis of l glutamate as model amino acid and glucose as model monosaccharide the degradation rate of l glutamate and glucose at dosages of 0 5 and 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps were almost the same with that of control whereas it started to decrease when cuo nps concentration was above 10 mg g ts the inhibition effect observed in the degradation assays suggested that high dosage of cuo nps 10 mg g ts can disturb the hydrolysis and acidogenesis process in the chain elongation step with ethanol as electron donors sccs produced in fermentation are further converted to mccs by using acetate as model sccs it can be seen in fig s6b that the production of mccs and consumption of ethanol at low concentration of cuo nps 2 5 mg g ts was slightly lower than that of the control group however the mccs production further decreased to 57 3 and 26 1 of the control at 10 and 50 mg g ts of cuo nps respectively these indicated that the cuo nps pose negative effect on the chain elongation process and the extent was highly concentration dependent taken together all above results revealed that although chain elongation was weakly inhibited with cuo nps at 2 5 mg g ts was solubilization was enhanced finally leading to the improved mccs production during was fermentation in contrast high dosages of cuo nps highly enhanced was solubilization but hydrolysis acidogenesis and chain elongation were all significantly inhibited thus the improvement were not enough to offset inhibition resulting negative impact on overall mccs production as hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation are key bioprocess in anaerobic was fermentation these findings suggested that the activity of related reactions and microorganisms has been significantly influenced by cuo nps 3 3 ros generated in the bioreactor inhibited electron transport activity all respiring microorganisms possess an active ets which is an indicator of the biological activity of activated sludge blenkinsopp and lock 1990 wang et al 2013 therefore the ets activity with cuo nps was determined at the end of experiment 34th day the relative activities of ets which were dependent on cuo np dosage were illustrated in fig 2 a in the presence of 0 5 and 2 5 mg g ts of cuo nps the relative ets activity was increased by 2 and 6 compared with that of the control which was consistent with improved production of carboxylates shown in fig 1 however the presence of 10 and 50 mg g ts of cuo nps significantly inhibited the ets activity for instance the ets activity at 50 mg g ts cuo nps addition was about 51 2 lower than that of the control these results consisted well with the inhibition findings for mccs production from was indicating that the impact of cuo nps on the electron transfer activity directly related with the palmy or decay in was ethanol conversion and carboxylates production it has been demonstrated that the electron transfer efficiency in anaerobic fermentation is highly correlated with the viability of microorganisms currently the soluble metal ions were considered as an important parameter concerning the nps biotoxicity to microorganisms tang et al 2016 therefore the concentrations of cu ions in all the reactors containing 0 5 to 50 mg g ts cuo nps were measured and the results revealed that the dissolution of cuo nps was only 0 5 1 5 0 15 36 mg l cu2 released fig 2b moreover the effects of the cu ions on the mccs production from was were explored the results showed that such low concentrations of cu ions 0 15 36 mg l cause negligible changes in anaerobic fermentation metabolism and mccs production from was fig 2b indicating the effect of released ions on the performance of the bioreactor can be excluded it is well known that nps can influence the metabolism activity and viability of microcosm through generation of ros degli esposti and mclennan 1998 tian et al 2019 usually ros including superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh are produced under aerobic anaerobic conditions and show an increasing trend with increased amount of nps degli esposti and mclennan 1998 mu and chen 2011 these ros could be depleted through reactions with some cellular components e g phospholipids and proteins and thus microbes can maintain normal metabolic activities wang and chen 2016 however an excessive oxidative stress can lead to the reduction of cell viability and even cell death once this antioxidant self defense is breached jeong et al 2016 in the present study ros produced in the fermentation assay with or without cuo nps were detected as shown in fig 2c cuo nps promoted ros generation in a concentration dependent manner in comparison with the control the amount of ros in system amended with 0 5 and 2 5 mg g ts of cuo nps was increased only by 1 1 and 3 5 respectively combined with the electron transfer activity intracellular ros generation at this level should not have impact on the microbial metabolism and the carboxylates production nevertheless in the presence of 10 and 50 mg g ts of cuo nps the amount of intracellular ros generated in the anaerobic system was dramatically 25 9 and 47 9 higher than that of the control respectively under such conditions a negative correlation between the intracellular ros level and the electron transfer activity was observed the results suggested that the decrease in electron transfer activity and thus declined carboxylates production with the dosage of cuo nps exceeded 10 mg g ts could be mainly attributed to the generation of excessive ros meanwhile the underlying mechanism of electron transfer activity and carboxylates production facilitated by lower dosages of cuo nps was unclear and need to be further investigated 3 4 cuo np induced alterations in microbial community to gain more insight into how low dosage of cuo nps influenced mccs production the microbial community composition between the control and the 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps exposed fermenter were compared using high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna genes the rarefaction curves fig s7 a si of the two samples gradually flattened suggesting that the sequencing depth was enough to cover the whole diversity the shannon and chao indices in 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps group were 4 58 0 03 and 1443 11 respectively which were a little lower to those in the control group 4 86 0 07 and 1450 7 the results indicated that cuo nps addition could decrease the microbial diversity which was consistent with previous studies tang et al 2016 wei et al 2021 venn diagram based on 0 03 distance showed that the number of otus were 984 and 1176 in experimental and control groups respectively which further demonstrated that the microbial diversity was reduced with cuo np addition fig s7b fig s8 a b showed the phylum and order levels distributions in control and experimental groups the main phyla in both groups included synergistota proteobacteria actinobacteriota firmicutes bacteroidetes caldatribacteriota planctomycetota and chloroflexi which totally accounted above 90 of the microbial population more specially actinobacteriota and chloroflexi were the dominate phyla in both two samples and the dominance of two phyla was also found in other studies for the anaerobic fermentation of was wan et al 2016 wei et al 2021 firmicutes were also frequently found in the anaerobic digestion of was and chain elongation process angenent et al 2016 and their abundance in experimental reactor was little lower than that obtained in the control 12 6 vs 13 9 which indicated that the addition of 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps might weakly inhibit the chain elongation process in contrast the abundances of caldatribacteriota and synergistota in the experimental group increased by 7 2 and 6 3 compared to those in the control group the above phyla are closely related to the hydrolysis of organic matter hania et al 2016 it was worth to note that a higher relative abundance of phylum planctomycetota both obligate and facultative aerobic chemoheterotrophs was observed in the experimental group which was probably related to the generation of ros induced by addition of cuo nps glöckner et al 2003 therefore the results revealed that the cuo np addition could alter the overall taxonomic structure of bacterial communities in anaerobic fermentation of was fig 3 showed the genus level identification of the sequences and cuo nps increased the relative abundances of functional microorganisms related to hydrolysis and acidogenesis for example the relative abundance of georgenia sp capable of performing hydrolysis in the cuo np was 15 8 which showed an increase of 4 2 compared to the control group li et al 2007 moreover the candidatus caldatribacterium sp is considered to participate in hydrolysis and acidogenesis vickers 2017 and cuo nps addition increased its abundances clostridium sp was reported to be responsible for chain elongation angenent et al 2016 and its abundances in the cuo np reactor was also little lower than that in the control group hence cuo np of 2 5 mg g ts could affect the microbial diversity and thus promote both the hydrolysis and acidogenesis steps while weakly inhibit chain elongation process 3 5 cuo np induced changes in proteomic profiles related to carboxylates production to deeply disclose the mechanism for the promotion of mccs in the presence of 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps the identified and differentially expressed proteins based on label free quantitative proteomic were analysed samples were obtained from control reactor and 2 5 mg g ts reactor at the end of the batch experiment and total 1785 proteins were identified from the samples 483 of the 1785 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins therein 294 proteins were up regulated and 189 proteins were down regulated the changes of metabolic pathways induced by 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps were further analyzed by kegg database table s1 listed the significant enriched pathways p 0 05 and differentially expressed proteins were found to be enriched in glycolysis gluconeogenesis 24 7 pyruvate metabolism 12 1 carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes 5 4 abc transporters 9 5 and butanoate metabolism 13 5 the above results can be attributed to that cuo nps induced the changes of protein expression levels involved in various pathways for the conversion of was to mccs therefore the identified proteins were manually inspected and key enzymes were selected for analyzing the main metabolic reactions involved in the conversion of was and mccs production i e polysaccharide hydrolysis proteolysis central carbon metabolism and chain elongation pathway fig 4 and 5 table s2 s6 3 5 1 hydrolysis related expressional trait consistent with was being the main substrate for the incubations proteins potentially involved in polysaccharide hydrolysis and proteolysis were identified table s2 according to the annotation to the cazy database 11 enzymes assigned to the glycoside hydrolases ghs and carbohydrate binding modules cbms families were detected it was obvious the differently expressed proteins relating with the key hydrolysis enzymes e g 4 α glucanotransferase and β 1 4 glucan were up regulated the result was inconsistent with the dextran degradation rate as shown in fig s5 which might be due to the diversity of polysaccharide and more abundant substrate regarding to the improved was solubilization the enriched genus candidatus caldatribacterium and species acetomicrobium mobile with the addition of cuo nps appeared as key actors for polysaccharide hydrolysis which also had been studied as polysaccharide hydrolysis species fig 3 vickers 2017 meanwhile the differently expressed proteins relating with the flagella and pilin monomer assigned to genus ca caldatribacterium were up regulated genus ca caldatribacterium was motile through on flagella lin et al 2014 and the higher expressed level of pilin monomer could help the microorganisms to move forward to nutrients thereby promoting synthesis and metabolism of genus ca caldatribacterium overall the 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps induced the up regulated expression level of key enzymes involved in polysaccharide hydrolysis which could be one reason for the promotion of mccs production the extracellular protease activity was first supported by the identification of a putative extracellular protease which could break proteins bonds to form peptides rawlings et al 2014 table s3 additionally a membrane bound serine protease and carboxypeptidase protein which could induce the fragmentation of proteins polypeptide and formation of amino acids were also detected however there were no significant regulation of these mentioned proteins involved in proteolysis demonstrating that the addition of cuo nps did not affect the proteolysis the different expression level of proteins for polysaccharide hydrolysis and proteolysis might be due to the interaction between the functional microbial species and cuo nps and thereby indirectly affect the proteins expression levels 3 5 2 metabolism of monosaccharides related expressional trait after polysaccharide hydrolysis and proteolysis monosaccharides and amino acids were channeled to the central catabolic pathways to generate pyruvate it is known that the transmembrane transport and intracellular metabolism are the indispensable steps for the utilization of monosaccharides and amino acids the analysis of proteomic data revealed that the identified proteins related to monosaccharides e g glucose and pentose transporters was significantly up regulated in contrast there were no significant changes of protein expression levels related to amino acids transporters this was consistent with the results of hydrolysis indicating that the exposure to low dosages of cuo nps could promoted the monosaccharides transmembrane transport process while shows no impact on the transport process of amino acids regarding the intracellular metabolism of monosaccharides for pyruvate synthesis only one enzyme assigned to the enter doudoroff pathway for the production of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate was detected fig 4 in contrast proteins from the complete embden meyerhof pathway glycolysis were identified along with the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway almost all identified proteins involved in glycolysis pathway were up regulated except the enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase while the identified proteins in pentose phosphate pathway were adverse fig 4 and table s4 these observations indicated that cuo nps addition could change the metabolism pathway of monosaccharides in addition pyruvate synthase is a key enzyme involved in the glucose metabolism leiyu et al 2009 which assigned 7 differentially expressed proteins as shown in table s4 5 up regulated and 2 down regulated according to the sourced microorganisms of each differentially expressed protein via proteomic the up regulated differentially expressed proteins involved in pyruvate synthase were originated from the species anaerolinea thermophila while the down regulated proteins could be assigned to genus acetomicrobium the results indicated that cuo nps selectively induced the expression of proteins involved in pyruvate synthase from some bacteria in the mixed culture interestingly several identified proteins assigned to superoxide dismutase from a thermophila were highly expressed with 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps table s6 as demonstrated by previous studies superoxide dismutase is capable of scavenging ros hu and tirelli 2012 nantapong et al 2019 the high expression level of superoxide dismutase could avoid the negative impact of intracellular ros on the microbial metabolism with low dosage of cuo nps this phenomenon was in accordance with the result of electron transfer activity in addition the up regulation of v f type reversible atpases subunit atpa and atpb were also observed in cuo np group table s6 which can transport protons or sodium cations across the membrane junge and nelson 2005 the up regulated atpases two three fold higher than the control was originated from the species a thermophila which further indicated that a thermophila was the functional microorganism for the metabolism of monosaccharides taken together the addition of low cuo nps displayed contributive characteristics in transport and metabolism of monosaccharides among the identified proteins involved in amino acid metabolism 26 could be assigned to proline metabolism 16 to arginine biosynthesis and 3 to serine metabolism the proteins for glutamate serine and arginine biosynthesis were all identified except arginine succinate synthase arginine serine and asparate could be converted into pyruvate and acetyl coa after oxidative decarboxylation for carboxylates biosynthesis the proteins involved in glutamate serine and asparate metabolism into tca cycle intermediates and pyruvate were also identified however there were no significant up regulation or down regulation of these identified proteins almost all the identified proteins related to amino acids degradation except arginine mainly attributed to strains from the aminivibrio pyruvatiphilus the relative abundances of this genus were similar in two samples both in 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and proteomic analysis fig 3 therefore there was strong evidence that cuo nps addition has negligible effect on amino acids consumption 3 5 3 carboxylates production related expressional trait there were 9 enzymes identified in the pyruvate metabolism fig 5 and table s5 the pathway module involved in pyruvate converted to acetyl coa was complete and the pyruvate synthase subunit porabcd was observed in high expression level 1 5 3 fold higher than the control the highly expressed pyruvate synthase could be a key reason for the promotion of sccs production acetyl coa and other intermediates involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle would be further catalyzed into different products according to the identified proteins a variety of fermentation products including acetate propionate butyrate could be generated it is known that acetate is usually the end fermentation product thus the activities of key acetate forming enzymes phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase were determined as shown in fig 5 the expression of phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase in the experimental sample were up regulated relatively to the control indicating that the acetogenesis could be stimulated in experimental group our previous study demonstrated that higher concentration of sccs could accelerate the production of mccs liu et al 2020 thus the promotion of acetogenesis and acetate generation should be the main reason for the enhanced mcc n caproate production in addition alcohol dehydrogenase responsible for acetyl coa formation from ethanol in chain elongation process related proteins originated from clostridium sp which known as chain elongation bacteria was also up regulated this phenomenon was consistent with a higher ethanol consumption rate observed in experimental sample acetyl coa acyltransferase acetoacetyl coa reductase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase and acyl coa thioesterase involved in cycle pathway were also essential for mccs production from acyl coa han et al 2018 wu et al 2020a in total 17 proteins relating to above 5 essential enzymes were identified and they were weakly down regulated took 0 7 0 8 of the control except acetyl coa acyltransferase and acyl coa thioesterase results were shown in table s5 overall although cuo nps at 2 5 mg g weakly inhibited chain elongation process they induced high expression level of key enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism and acetogenesis ultimately leading to the enhanced mccs production 3 6 current understandings of dosage dependent effects of cuo nps on mccs production based on the above observations and discussions the mechanism for the effect of cuo nps on mccs production from was during anaerobic fermentation was concluded it has become a consensus that cuo nps could cause inhibition on the anaerobic production of ch4 from was and the present study also found that the mccs production was inhibited by cuo nps exceeded 10 mg g ts the ros produced in anaerobic conversion system was inferred to be the primary cause of the phenomena in contrast to the inhibition effect the present study demonstrated that at cuo nps lower than 2 5 mg g ts mccs production could be efficiently promoted combining metaproteomic analyses chemical and molecular approaches a model for the studied ecosystem is proposed fig 6 its main features with low dosage of cuo nps exposure are as follows 1 significant enhancement of was solubilization 2 increased abundance of key microorganisms and enzymes associated with polysaccharide hydrolysis 3 improved transport metabolism of monosaccharides and acetogenesis 4 higher expression level of superoxide dismutase despite the generation of ros in was anaerobic fermentation and finally 5 only a weak inhibition of chain elongation the information gained on the studied ecosystem highlights the possibility of regulation of functional microbial groups and catalytic reaction activity with cuo nps for mccs production and complements the results gained from previous 16s rrna genes or metagenomic studies huang et al 2019 luna delrisco et al 2011 wei et al 2021 while the current finding highlights the differential response and mechanism involved in the exposure of cuo nps to mcc production fermentation system future work is needed to determine the expression level of proteins for carbohydrate degradation and proteolysis and understand how to steer the community further towards mccs to increase the efficiency and selectivity of these systems and reduce the adverse effect of cuo nps currently several companies are paying attention to mccs production from organic wastes for example a spin off company named chaincraft has made a great effort to establish setup and design for mass production of mccs from was www chaincraft nl thus mccs production from organic wastes is deemed as a promising and economic biotechnology and the increase obtained in present study could be quite helpful for recovery extraction in the further processing as a proof of concept study here the highest selectivity of mccs 36 obtained at 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps was relatively low some strategies such as continuous product extraction and improving the ratio of ethanol to was can also be adopted in future to improve the selectivity and production of mccs from cuo np containing sludge and last but certainly not least repeated batch test or long term continuous flow experiment should be conducted in the future study to explore more precise microbial mechanism and evaluate the long term stability of mcc production process promoted by 2 5 mg g ts cuo to shed light for safer management and better practical utilization of cuo nps polluted sludge 4 conclusion this study comprehensively revealed that cuo nps displayed dosage dependent enhancement to inhibition effect on was anaerobic fermentation for mccs production it was found that the mccs generation was inhibited by cuo nps exceeded 10 mg g ts and ros produced in anaerobic conversion system was inferred to be the primary cause of the phenomena however the present study demonstrated that at cuo nps lower than 2 5 mg g ts environmentally relevant concentrations the sccs and mccs production could be efficiently promoted combining metaproteomic analyses chemical and molecular approaches the underlying mechanism may involve the enhanced was solubilization increased electron transfer activities increased abundances of key microorganisms and expression level of key enzymes associated with hydrolysis and acetogenesis process overall this study provides important

15166,the growing applications of cuo nanoparticles nps in industrial and agriculture has increased their concentrations in wastewater and subsequently accumulated in waste activated sludge was raising concerns about their impact on reutilization of was especially on the medium chain carboxylates mccs production from anaerobic fermentation of was here we showed that cuo nps at 10 50 mg g ts can significantly inhibit mccs production and reactive oxygen species generation was revealed to be the key factor linked to the phenomena at lower cuo nps concentrations 0 5 2 5 mg g ts however mccs production was enhanced with a maximum level of 37 compared to the control the combination of molecular approaches and metaproteomic analysis revealed that although low dosage cuo nps 2 5 mg g ts weakly inhibited chain elongation process they displayed contributive characteristics both in was solubilization and transport metabolism of carbohydrate these results demonstrated that the complex microbial processes for mccs production in the anaerobic fermentation of was can be affected by cuo nps in a dosage dependent manner via regulating microbial protein expression level our findings can provide new insights into the influence of cuo nps on anaerobic fermentation process and shed light on the treatment option for the resource utilization of cuo nps polluted was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation cuo nanoparticles medium chain carboxylate metaproteomic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rapid innovation and commercialization of nanotechnology large amounts of nanoparticles nps have been incorporated into consumer and industrial products particularly as a p type semiconductor cuo nps were produced world widely at a dosage of 570 t in 2014 and would be 1600 t by the year 2025 hou et al 2017 due to the unique physicochemical properties cuo nps have been widely used in various fields such as industrial catalysis and sustainable agriculture otero gonzález et al 2014 ingle 2021 the large production and widespread utilization of cuo nps can lead to their environmental release and accumulation in fact cuo np are commonly found in different environmental media and matrices e g polluted sludge and water particularly waste activated sludge was is considered as a reservoir for cuo nps accumulation since many of nps ultimately enter the wastewater treatment plants wwtp and concentrated in was kiser et al 2010 limbach et al 2008 for instance the content of cuo nps in sludge is estimated to be approximately 2 5 mg g of total solids ts according to the sample collected worldwide abdulsada et al 2021 mu et al 2011 and the value can be higher in china as the concentration of cu in 193 sludge samples was detected to be about 908 4 mg kg 1 tou et al 2017 furthermore a much greater level of cuo nps may be measured in the near future considering their increasing production and use cuo nps have been reported to exhibit diverse adverse effects on individual organisms by causing oxidative stress cell membrane disruption and inactivation of key enzymes gonzalez estrella et al 2013 tian et al 2017 therefore treatment and resource utilization of the large amount of was also faces risk posed by cuo nps anaerobic conversion occurred in a syntrophic microbial community has been strategically used as a cost effective method to achieve simultaneously was reduction and valuable end products production methane ch4 hydrogen h2 short chain carboxylates sccs mainly c2 c5 carboxylic acids are the common products of anaerobic was fermentation whereas medium chain carboxylates mccs is emerged recently as a class of novel product with a higher utilization value as it carries more energy and has better separability as a type of fatty acid that contain 6 to 12 carbon atoms mccs can be produced through sccs upgrading accompanying with electron donors e g ethanol by carboxylate platform in anaerobic reactor the pivotal biochemical reactions for these bioproducts generation in anaerobic reactor involve solubilization hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation methanogenesis wu et al 2020b the solubilization step has been considered the bottleneck of was anaerobic conversion as most organic content such as carbohydrates and proteins is enclosed inside the microbial cell membranes zheng et al 2014 this soluble organic matter should be released and accessed by hydrolytic bacteria to produce polymers and monomers yang et al 2020 subsequently acidogenic bacteria metabolize the polymer and monomers to yield sccs especially acetate for further mccs or ch4 synthesis conducted by chain elongation microbe or methanogens respectively angenent et al 2016 in this regard the variation of operated conditions can induce the dissimilarities in any aforementioned reactions liu and ghosh 1997 zheng et al 2014 although experimental setups could influence mccs production from was the characteristic of was such as its composition is regarded as the foundational and key factor influencing the fermentation performance liu et al 2012 wang et al 2020a cuo nps as an accumulated material in was can potentially affect functional microbial groups and catalytic reaction activity for was anaerobic conversion therefore it is worth investigating the effect of cuo np on mccs generation and then providing information for further study to improve mccs production and shorten fermentation duration in case of some particle occurrence in the experimental sludge like most other syntrophic communities it should be emphasized that the anaerobic conversion could not only be influenced by the activity of individual microorganisms but also the syntrophic community it has been reported that the negative effect of cuo nps on ch4 production was mainly attributed to their inhibition on methanogenesis ajay et al 2020 chen et al 2020 however a recent report by wei et al 2021 suggested that cuo at 5 mg g ts significantly promoted h2 production due to the enhanced was solubilization these studies revealed that the effect of cuo nps on the anaerobic fermentation are greatly influenced by the unique biological process required for the production of each product however a comprehensive understanding of mccs production in was anaerobic fermentation influenced by cuo nps is lacking such as how does cuo np dosage in was impact its anaerobic fermentation what is the mechanism of the effect of cuo nps on various processes involved in mcc generation besides only microbial community composition was used to explore the mechanisms behind the effect of cuo nps on anaerobic conversion process which was still not convincible huang et al 2019 luna delrisco et al 2011 wang et al 2017 in this study we explored the potential effects of cuo nps on mccs production from was anaerobic fermentation and the underlying mechanisms based on molecular approaches and label free quantitative proteomic analysis as a quantitative metaproteomic technology label free quantitative proteomic analysis could provides direct proof on the expressed genes and quantify the key proteins from multiple differential samples associated with various operations abram et al 2011 lü et al 2014 the current study will focus on 1 systematically exploring the dosage response relationship between cuo nps and mccs production and the involved each step 2 identification the contribution of generated intracellular reactive oxygen species ros released ions as well as disturbed electron transfer activity to the change of mccs yield and 3 revealing the possible mechanism for the production of mccs in the presence of cuo nps from protein and genes aspects this study is expected to contribute to the comprehensive understanding of the impact of cuo nps on was anaerobic fermentation through complex microbial process and provide important clues for resource utilization of cuo nps containing sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum was and cuo nps the inoculum used in this study was derived from a well characterized reactor with an operating period of more than one year fed with was and ethanol to produce mccs the characteristics of the inoculum were as follows total solid ts 21 3 0 7 g l volatile solid vs 16 9 1 1 g l

present study was purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china the transmission electron microscopy tem image of cuo nps was obtained using a fei talos f200s hillsboro or usa using a voltage of 200 kv to visualize their shape and particle size 40 nm fig s1 si 2 2 effects of cuo nps on the mccs production from was the experiments were conducted in 150 ml serum bottles with working volume of 70 ml 20 ml of inoculum and 50 ml of was together with 300 mm c ethanol for mccs potential tests and the concentration of ethanol as electron donor was determined according to previous studies wang et al 2020b wu et al 2018 one reactor was labeled as the control without cuo nps addition while the other four reactors were dosage with cuo nps 0 464 2 464 9 964 and 49 964 mg g ts to the final concentrations of 0 5 2 5 10 and 50 mg g ts based on the initial cuo nps in was in addition the reactors with only inoculum and basic anaerobic medium ba medium were used as negative controls the detailed composition of ba medium was described in our previous study yang et al 2019 all reactors were performed in triplicates and lasted for 34 days the ph was adjusted to 7 in all the reactors by adding 4 m naoh and 4 m hcl 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes 100 mm was added initially to inhibit methanogens the above reactors were flushed with n2 for 5 min to create an anaerobic environment sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and then placed in a 35 c incubator with a shaking speed of 150 rpm the electron transport system ets activity analysis and ros production were also evaluated according to the reference limbach et al 2007 tian et al 2017 in order to explore the influencing mechanism of cuo nps their impacts on four processes solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and chain elongation involved in mccs production were assessed with model substrates supporting information the significance of results was evaluated using the analysis of variance anova and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 2 3 effect of cu2 on the mccs production the effect of cu2 on the mccs production were tested cucl2 instead of cuo nps was injected into the reactors according to the cu2 concentrations determined at the end of cuo nps experiment in section 2 2 the other operation conditions were similar to the cuo nps experiment the mccs concentration were determined after 34 days all the tests were performed in triplicates 2 4 microbial community compositions analyses to characterize time dependent microbial composition changes among inoculum group control group and 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps group the microbial communities in the three groups were analyzed at different operational times samples control 7 control 15 control 30 and control 34 were obtained from reactor c on days 7 15 30 and 34 respectively samples cuo 7 cuo 15 cuo 30 and cuo 34 were obtained from reactor 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps on days 7 15 30 and 34 respectively then the microbial community composition between the control and the 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps exposed fermenter on day 34 at stable state were compared detailedly to gain more insight into how low dosage of cuo nps influenced mccs production detailed information was described in si 2 5 label free quantitative proteomic analyses samples from control group 0 mg cuo g ts and the experimental group 2 5 mg cuo g ts were also collected at the end of the experiment for label free quantitative proteomic analysis the total protein in the samples was extracted and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page and the total protein concentration was determined through the bradford method sengupta et al 2011 0 5 μg μl of the peptide was taken out of each sample for protein identification by liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer mass spectrometer analysis the raw data were processed using peaksstudio version 8 5 against the ncbi database detailed information can be found in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 dosage dependent promotion and suppression of mcc production by cuo nps with ethanol as electron donor the production of carboxylates sccs and mccs from was at different dosages of cuo nps were investigated and shown in fig 1 and fig s2 after operation for 34 days the concentration of carboxylates and microbial community composition in all reactors reached a stationary level fig s3 as the concentrations of n heptanoate and n caprylate were almost negligible 8 mg cod l n caproate was thus considered as the sole mcc product in this study as shown in fig 1 it was clear that cuo nps affect the production of carboxylates and the consumption of ethanol in a dosage dependent manner the production of carboxylates increased significantly with the dosage of cuo nps in the range of 0 2 5 mg g ts and achieved the highest at 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps the generation of mccs and consumption of ethanol displayed similar trend and the maximum mccs concentration achieved 6600 mg cod l at 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps which was 37 higher than that of the untreated control 4800 mg cod l p 0 05 nevertheless the yield of sccs valerate butyrate propionate acetate increased up to a maximum of only 5 7 when cuo nps content was 2 5 mg g ts these results suggested that low cuo nps dosage 2 5 mg g ts could mainly stimulate mccs production from sccs and ethanol angenent et al 2016 with further increase of the cuo nps dosages to 50 mg g ts however the total yield of carboxylates decreased to 45 6 sccs to 52 9 and mccs to 28 of that observed in the control p 0 05 respectively meanwhile the consumption of ethanol decreased to 4600 mg cod l which only correspond to 56 1 of that in the control group overall these results suggested that low cuo nps dosage 2 5 mg g ts addition could lead to significantly enhanced production of mccs from was but extended exposure to cuo nps would cause severe toxicity and inhibition effect to date most previous studies reported the inhibitory effects of cuo nps even at low dosage on the anaerobic microorganisms chen et al 2014b otero gonzález et al 2014 wang et al 2017 different with previous reports our results showed that cuo nps 0 50 mg g ts displayed enhancement to inhibition effect on was anaerobic fermentation for mccs production based on these distinct phenomena it is of great and enlightening significance to explore the mechanisms on anaerobic conversion of was for mccs production under different cuo np stresses which were carried out in the following section 3 2 cuo nps affected each stage of was anaerobic fermentation to better understand the role of cuo nps the effects of cuo nps on key processes i e solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and chain elongation were further conducted as the bottleneck steps of was anaerobic fermentation solubilization is a non bioprocess with the release of soluble substances as the organic matters mainly existed in the solid phase of was liu and fang 2002 therefore the extent of was solubilization could be expressed by the variations of soluble organic matters as shown in fig s4a all dosages of cuo nps addition promoted the release of organic matters with the amount of polysaccharide protein and scod in the bioreactor increased with the increasing cuo nps dosage after initial 2 d fermentation three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was also used to characterize the soluble organic matters in fermentation liquor at different dosage of cuo nps as shown in fig s4 b f the ex em peaks at 250 280 200 380 nm which represented the areas related to the biodegradable soluble substances chen et al 2003 was positively correlated with the dosage of cuo nps similarly the free lactate dehydrogenase ldh and dna associated with the cell membrane integrity also increased fig s4g and was 74 5 and 76 1 higher than that of the control when the cuo nps dosage was up to 50 mg g ts all these results indicated that addition of cuo nps improved solubilization of was and the trend were positively related to cuo nps dosage based on the characteristics of cuo nps three possibilities are proposed to explain the improved was solubilization first as a catalyst cuo np destroys the structure of was to make it easy to mix with water chen et al 2014a also demonstrated that cunps could ruin the layout of sludge and reduce its particle size by environmental scanning electron microscopy analysis second cuo nps improve the interaction between hydrophobic insoluble organic matters mainly protein like substances in was and aqueous solution by its surface reactive property in future research determining the solubility and structure of protein like substances in an abiotic environment and their interactions with cuo nps may verify the hypothesis third partially broken cells in was by cuo nps may cause the release of internal macromolecular organics into the fermentation reactor this has been shown by the sem images and higher released ldh free dna fig s5 and fig s4g the soluble organic matters released from was solubilization would be further biodegraded by the hydrolysis and acidification process and further converted to mccs through chain elongation step the effect of cuo nps on the hydrolysis step was examined using model proteins bovine serum albumin bsa and model polysaccharide dextran fig s6 a showed the degradation efficiency of bsa and dextran at different concentration of cuo nps at dosages of 0 5 and 2 5 mg g ts the influences of cuo nps on degradations of bsa and dextran were both insignificant compared to untreated control however the degradations rate of bsa and dextran at 10 mg g ts of cuo nps were lower than that in the control 9 2 and 39 versus 24 5 and 81 1 respectively and the lowest degradations rate of both molecules was obtained at 50 mg g ts of cuo nps took only 17 9 and 24 8 of the control respectively fig s6 a illustrated similar result for the acidogenesis of l glutamate as model amino acid and glucose as model monosaccharide the degradation rate of l glutamate and glucose at dosages of 0 5 and 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps were almost the same with that of control whereas it started to decrease when cuo nps concentration was above 10 mg g ts the inhibition effect observed in the degradation assays suggested that high dosage of cuo nps 10 mg g ts can disturb the hydrolysis and acidogenesis process in the chain elongation step with ethanol as electron donors sccs produced in fermentation are further converted to mccs by using acetate as model sccs it can be seen in fig s6b that the production of mccs and consumption of ethanol at low concentration of cuo nps 2 5 mg g ts was slightly lower than that of the control group however the mccs production further decreased to 57 3 and 26 1 of the control at 10 and 50 mg g ts of cuo nps respectively these indicated that the cuo nps pose negative effect on the chain elongation process and the extent was highly concentration dependent taken together all above results revealed that although chain elongation was weakly inhibited with cuo nps at 2 5 mg g ts was solubilization was enhanced finally leading to the improved mccs production during was fermentation in contrast high dosages of cuo nps highly enhanced was solubilization but hydrolysis acidogenesis and chain elongation were all significantly inhibited thus the improvement were not enough to offset inhibition resulting negative impact on overall mccs production as hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation are key bioprocess in anaerobic was fermentation these findings suggested that the activity of related reactions and microorganisms has been significantly influenced by cuo nps 3 3 ros generated in the bioreactor inhibited electron transport activity all respiring microorganisms possess an active ets which is an indicator of the biological activity of activated sludge blenkinsopp and lock 1990 wang et al 2013 therefore the ets activity with cuo nps was determined at the end of experiment 34th day the relative activities of ets which were dependent on cuo np dosage were illustrated in fig 2 a in the presence of 0 5 and 2 5 mg g ts of cuo nps the relative ets activity was increased by 2 and 6 compared with that of the control which was consistent with improved production of carboxylates shown in fig 1 however the presence of 10 and 50 mg g ts of cuo nps significantly inhibited the ets activity for instance the ets activity at 50 mg g ts cuo nps addition was about 51 2 lower than that of the control these results consisted well with the inhibition findings for mccs production from was indicating that the impact of cuo nps on the electron transfer activity directly related with the palmy or decay in was ethanol conversion and carboxylates production it has been demonstrated that the electron transfer efficiency in anaerobic fermentation is highly correlated with the viability of microorganisms currently the soluble metal ions were considered as an important parameter concerning the nps biotoxicity to microorganisms tang et al 2016 therefore the concentrations of cu ions in all the reactors containing 0 5 to 50 mg g ts cuo nps were measured and the results revealed that the dissolution of cuo nps was only 0 5 1 5 0 15 36 mg l cu2 released fig 2b moreover the effects of the cu ions on the mccs production from was were explored the results showed that such low concentrations of cu ions 0 15 36 mg l cause negligible changes in anaerobic fermentation metabolism and mccs production from was fig 2b indicating the effect of released ions on the performance of the bioreactor can be excluded it is well known that nps can influence the metabolism activity and viability of microcosm through generation of ros degli esposti and mclennan 1998 tian et al 2019 usually ros including superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh are produced under aerobic anaerobic conditions and show an increasing trend with increased amount of nps degli esposti and mclennan 1998 mu and chen 2011 these ros could be depleted through reactions with some cellular components e g phospholipids and proteins and thus microbes can maintain normal metabolic activities wang and chen 2016 however an excessive oxidative stress can lead to the reduction of cell viability and even cell death once this antioxidant self defense is breached jeong et al 2016 in the present study ros produced in the fermentation assay with or without cuo nps were detected as shown in fig 2c cuo nps promoted ros generation in a concentration dependent manner in comparison with the control the amount of ros in system amended with 0 5 and 2 5 mg g ts of cuo nps was increased only by 1 1 and 3 5 respectively combined with the electron transfer activity intracellular ros generation at this level should not have impact on the microbial metabolism and the carboxylates production nevertheless in the presence of 10 and 50 mg g ts of cuo nps the amount of intracellular ros generated in the anaerobic system was dramatically 25 9 and 47 9 higher than that of the control respectively under such conditions a negative correlation between the intracellular ros level and the electron transfer activity was observed the results suggested that the decrease in electron transfer activity and thus declined carboxylates production with the dosage of cuo nps exceeded 10 mg g ts could be mainly attributed to the generation of excessive ros meanwhile the underlying mechanism of electron transfer activity and carboxylates production facilitated by lower dosages of cuo nps was unclear and need to be further investigated 3 4 cuo np induced alterations in microbial community to gain more insight into how low dosage of cuo nps influenced mccs production the microbial community composition between the control and the 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps exposed fermenter were compared using high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna genes the rarefaction curves fig s7 a si of the two samples gradually flattened suggesting that the sequencing depth was enough to cover the whole diversity the shannon and chao indices in 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps group were 4 58 0 03 and 1443 11 respectively which were a little lower to those in the control group 4 86 0 07 and 1450 7 the results indicated that cuo nps addition could decrease the microbial diversity which was consistent with previous studies tang et al 2016 wei et al 2021 venn diagram based on 0 03 distance showed that the number of otus were 984 and 1176 in experimental and control groups respectively which further demonstrated that the microbial diversity was reduced with cuo np addition fig s7b fig s8 a b showed the phylum and order levels distributions in control and experimental groups the main phyla in both groups included synergistota proteobacteria actinobacteriota firmicutes bacteroidetes caldatribacteriota planctomycetota and chloroflexi which totally accounted above 90 of the microbial population more specially actinobacteriota and chloroflexi were the dominate phyla in both two samples and the dominance of two phyla was also found in other studies for the anaerobic fermentation of was wan et al 2016 wei et al 2021 firmicutes were also frequently found in the anaerobic digestion of was and chain elongation process angenent et al 2016 and their abundance in experimental reactor was little lower than that obtained in the control 12 6 vs 13 9 which indicated that the addition of 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps might weakly inhibit the chain elongation process in contrast the abundances of caldatribacteriota and synergistota in the experimental group increased by 7 2 and 6 3 compared to those in the control group the above phyla are closely related to the hydrolysis of organic matter hania et al 2016 it was worth to note that a higher relative abundance of phylum planctomycetota both obligate and facultative aerobic chemoheterotrophs was observed in the experimental group which was probably related to the generation of ros induced by addition of cuo nps glöckner et al 2003 therefore the results revealed that the cuo np addition could alter the overall taxonomic structure of bacterial communities in anaerobic fermentation of was fig 3 showed the genus level identification of the sequences and cuo nps increased the relative abundances of functional microorganisms related to hydrolysis and acidogenesis for example the relative abundance of georgenia sp capable of performing hydrolysis in the cuo np was 15 8 which showed an increase of 4 2 compared to the control group li et al 2007 moreover the candidatus caldatribacterium sp is considered to participate in hydrolysis and acidogenesis vickers 2017 and cuo nps addition increased its abundances clostridium sp was reported to be responsible for chain elongation angenent et al 2016 and its abundances in the cuo np reactor was also little lower than that in the control group hence cuo np of 2 5 mg g ts could affect the microbial diversity and thus promote both the hydrolysis and acidogenesis steps while weakly inhibit chain elongation process 3 5 cuo np induced changes in proteomic profiles related to carboxylates production to deeply disclose the mechanism for the promotion of mccs in the presence of 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps the identified and differentially expressed proteins based on label free quantitative proteomic were analysed samples were obtained from control reactor and 2 5 mg g ts reactor at the end of the batch experiment and total 1785 proteins were identified from the samples 483 of the 1785 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins therein 294 proteins were up regulated and 189 proteins were down regulated the changes of metabolic pathways induced by 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps were further analyzed by kegg database table s1 listed the significant enriched pathways p 0 05 and differentially expressed proteins were found to be enriched in glycolysis gluconeogenesis 24 7 pyruvate metabolism 12 1 carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes 5 4 abc transporters 9 5 and butanoate metabolism 13 5 the above results can be attributed to that cuo nps induced the changes of protein expression levels involved in various pathways for the conversion of was to mccs therefore the identified proteins were manually inspected and key enzymes were selected for analyzing the main metabolic reactions involved in the conversion of was and mccs production i e polysaccharide hydrolysis proteolysis central carbon metabolism and chain elongation pathway fig 4 and 5 table s2 s6 3 5 1 hydrolysis related expressional trait consistent with was being the main substrate for the incubations proteins potentially involved in polysaccharide hydrolysis and proteolysis were identified table s2 according to the annotation to the cazy database 11 enzymes assigned to the glycoside hydrolases ghs and carbohydrate binding modules cbms families were detected it was obvious the differently expressed proteins relating with the key hydrolysis enzymes e g 4 α glucanotransferase and β 1 4 glucan were up regulated the result was inconsistent with the dextran degradation rate as shown in fig s5 which might be due to the diversity of polysaccharide and more abundant substrate regarding to the improved was solubilization the enriched genus candidatus caldatribacterium and species acetomicrobium mobile with the addition of cuo nps appeared as key actors for polysaccharide hydrolysis which also had been studied as polysaccharide hydrolysis species fig 3 vickers 2017 meanwhile the differently expressed proteins relating with the flagella and pilin monomer assigned to genus ca caldatribacterium were up regulated genus ca caldatribacterium was motile through on flagella lin et al 2014 and the higher expressed level of pilin monomer could help the microorganisms to move forward to nutrients thereby promoting synthesis and metabolism of genus ca caldatribacterium overall the 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps induced the up regulated expression level of key enzymes involved in polysaccharide hydrolysis which could be one reason for the promotion of mccs production the extracellular protease activity was first supported by the identification of a putative extracellular protease which could break proteins bonds to form peptides rawlings et al 2014 table s3 additionally a membrane bound serine protease and carboxypeptidase protein which could induce the fragmentation of proteins polypeptide and formation of amino acids were also detected however there were no significant regulation of these mentioned proteins involved in proteolysis demonstrating that the addition of cuo nps did not affect the proteolysis the different expression level of proteins for polysaccharide hydrolysis and proteolysis might be due to the interaction between the functional microbial species and cuo nps and thereby indirectly affect the proteins expression levels 3 5 2 metabolism of monosaccharides related expressional trait after polysaccharide hydrolysis and proteolysis monosaccharides and amino acids were channeled to the central catabolic pathways to generate pyruvate it is known that the transmembrane transport and intracellular metabolism are the indispensable steps for the utilization of monosaccharides and amino acids the analysis of proteomic data revealed that the identified proteins related to monosaccharides e g glucose and pentose transporters was significantly up regulated in contrast there were no significant changes of protein expression levels related to amino acids transporters this was consistent with the results of hydrolysis indicating that the exposure to low dosages of cuo nps could promoted the monosaccharides transmembrane transport process while shows no impact on the transport process of amino acids regarding the intracellular metabolism of monosaccharides for pyruvate synthesis only one enzyme assigned to the enter doudoroff pathway for the production of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate was detected fig 4 in contrast proteins from the complete embden meyerhof pathway glycolysis were identified along with the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway almost all identified proteins involved in glycolysis pathway were up regulated except the enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase while the identified proteins in pentose phosphate pathway were adverse fig 4 and table s4 these observations indicated that cuo nps addition could change the metabolism pathway of monosaccharides in addition pyruvate synthase is a key enzyme involved in the glucose metabolism leiyu et al 2009 which assigned 7 differentially expressed proteins as shown in table s4 5 up regulated and 2 down regulated according to the sourced microorganisms of each differentially expressed protein via proteomic the up regulated differentially expressed proteins involved in pyruvate synthase were originated from the species anaerolinea thermophila while the down regulated proteins could be assigned to genus acetomicrobium the results indicated that cuo nps selectively induced the expression of proteins involved in pyruvate synthase from some bacteria in the mixed culture interestingly several identified proteins assigned to superoxide dismutase from a thermophila were highly expressed with 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps table s6 as demonstrated by previous studies superoxide dismutase is capable of scavenging ros hu and tirelli 2012 nantapong et al 2019 the high expression level of superoxide dismutase could avoid the negative impact of intracellular ros on the microbial metabolism with low dosage of cuo nps this phenomenon was in accordance with the result of electron transfer activity in addition the up regulation of v f type reversible atpases subunit atpa and atpb were also observed in cuo np group table s6 which can transport protons or sodium cations across the membrane junge and nelson 2005 the up regulated atpases two three fold higher than the control was originated from the species a thermophila which further indicated that a thermophila was the functional microorganism for the metabolism of monosaccharides taken together the addition of low cuo nps displayed contributive characteristics in transport and metabolism of monosaccharides among the identified proteins involved in amino acid metabolism 26 could be assigned to proline metabolism 16 to arginine biosynthesis and 3 to serine metabolism the proteins for glutamate serine and arginine biosynthesis were all identified except arginine succinate synthase arginine serine and asparate could be converted into pyruvate and acetyl coa after oxidative decarboxylation for carboxylates biosynthesis the proteins involved in glutamate serine and asparate metabolism into tca cycle intermediates and pyruvate were also identified however there were no significant up regulation or down regulation of these identified proteins almost all the identified proteins related to amino acids degradation except arginine mainly attributed to strains from the aminivibrio pyruvatiphilus the relative abundances of this genus were similar in two samples both in 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and proteomic analysis fig 3 therefore there was strong evidence that cuo nps addition has negligible effect on amino acids consumption 3 5 3 carboxylates production related expressional trait there were 9 enzymes identified in the pyruvate metabolism fig 5 and table s5 the pathway module involved in pyruvate converted to acetyl coa was complete and the pyruvate synthase subunit porabcd was observed in high expression level 1 5 3 fold higher than the control the highly expressed pyruvate synthase could be a key reason for the promotion of sccs production acetyl coa and other intermediates involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle would be further catalyzed into different products according to the identified proteins a variety of fermentation products including acetate propionate butyrate could be generated it is known that acetate is usually the end fermentation product thus the activities of key acetate forming enzymes phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase were determined as shown in fig 5 the expression of phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase in the experimental sample were up regulated relatively to the control indicating that the acetogenesis could be stimulated in experimental group our previous study demonstrated that higher concentration of sccs could accelerate the production of mccs liu et al 2020 thus the promotion of acetogenesis and acetate generation should be the main reason for the enhanced mcc n caproate production in addition alcohol dehydrogenase responsible for acetyl coa formation from ethanol in chain elongation process related proteins originated from clostridium sp which known as chain elongation bacteria was also up regulated this phenomenon was consistent with a higher ethanol consumption rate observed in experimental sample acetyl coa acyltransferase acetoacetyl coa reductase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase and acyl coa thioesterase involved in cycle pathway were also essential for mccs production from acyl coa han et al 2018 wu et al 2020a in total 17 proteins relating to above 5 essential enzymes were identified and they were weakly down regulated took 0 7 0 8 of the control except acetyl coa acyltransferase and acyl coa thioesterase results were shown in table s5 overall although cuo nps at 2 5 mg g weakly inhibited chain elongation process they induced high expression level of key enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism and acetogenesis ultimately leading to the enhanced mccs production 3 6 current understandings of dosage dependent effects of cuo nps on mccs production based on the above observations and discussions the mechanism for the effect of cuo nps on mccs production from was during anaerobic fermentation was concluded it has become a consensus that cuo nps could cause inhibition on the anaerobic production of ch4 from was and the present study also found that the mccs production was inhibited by cuo nps exceeded 10 mg g ts the ros produced in anaerobic conversion system was inferred to be the primary cause of the phenomena in contrast to the inhibition effect the present study demonstrated that at cuo nps lower than 2 5 mg g ts mccs production could be efficiently promoted combining metaproteomic analyses chemical and molecular approaches a model for the studied ecosystem is proposed fig 6 its main features with low dosage of cuo nps exposure are as follows 1 significant enhancement of was solubilization 2 increased abundance of key microorganisms and enzymes associated with polysaccharide hydrolysis 3 improved transport metabolism of monosaccharides and acetogenesis 4 higher expression level of superoxide dismutase despite the generation of ros in was anaerobic fermentation and finally 5 only a weak inhibition of chain elongation the information gained on the studied ecosystem highlights the possibility of regulation of functional microbial groups and catalytic reaction activity with cuo nps for mccs production and complements the results gained from previous 16s rrna genes or metagenomic studies huang et al 2019 luna delrisco et al 2011 wei et al 2021 while the current finding highlights the differential response and mechanism involved in the exposure of cuo nps to mcc production fermentation system future work is needed to determine the expression level of proteins for carbohydrate degradation and proteolysis and understand how to steer the community further towards mccs to increase the efficiency and selectivity of these systems and reduce the adverse effect of cuo nps currently several companies are paying attention to mccs production from organic wastes for example a spin off company named chaincraft has made a great effort to establish setup and design for mass production of mccs from was www chaincraft nl thus mccs production from organic wastes is deemed as a promising and economic biotechnology and the increase obtained in present study could be quite helpful for recovery extraction in the further processing as a proof of concept study here the highest selectivity of mccs 36 obtained at 2 5 mg g ts cuo nps was relatively low some strategies such as continuous product extraction and improving the ratio of ethanol to was can also be adopted in future to improve the selectivity and production of mccs from cuo np containing sludge and last but certainly not least repeated batch test or long term continuous flow experiment should be conducted in the future study to explore more precise microbial mechanism and evaluate the long term stability of mcc production process promoted by 2 5 mg g ts cuo to shed light for safer management and better practical utilization of cuo nps polluted sludge 4 conclusion this study comprehensively revealed that cuo nps displayed dosage dependent enhancement to inhibition effect on was anaerobic fermentation for mccs production it was found that the mccs generation was inhibited by cuo nps exceeded 10 mg g ts and ros produced in anaerobic conversion system was inferred to be the primary cause of the phenomena however the present study demonstrated that at cuo nps lower than 2 5 mg g ts environmentally relevant concentrations the sccs and mccs production could be efficiently promoted combining metaproteomic analyses chemical and molecular approaches the underlying mechanism may involve the enhanced was solubilization increased electron transfer activities increased abundances of key microorganisms and expression level of key enzymes associated with hydrolysis and acetogenesis process overall this study provides important

15167,the applicability of chemical actinometry to characterize the fluence in uv reactors with reflections non parallel light and variable water transmittance is limited due to the unknown effective path length or hydraulic shortcuts within the reactor in this study the effects of reflection and transmittance on actinometry were examined and a new optimized and easy method for determining fluence was developed ki kio3 and uridine actinometry experiments were carried out under controlled conditions using a collimated beam apparatus and a completely mixed batch reactor with or without diffuse reflection and compared to biodosimetry results whereas optically opaque actinometers such as ki kio3 are not directly capable of predicting the fluence of reflecting reactors the results of uridine actinometry are influenced by reflection and transmission to precisely predict the fluence rate in uv reactors with uridine knowledge about the effective optical path length of the light is needed here an existing method to mathematically calculate the optical path length was adopted and optimized for uridine actinometry results for average fluence were validated by biodosimetry using ms2 phages under different degrees of reflection and transmission it could be shown that by modifying the bottom of the reactor with diffusely reflecting polytetrafluoroethylene foil the fluence rate was increased by a factor of approximately 2 6 and the path length by factor of 2 4 when only half of the bottom was covered with reflective foil fluence rate increased by a factor of 1 8 and path length by 1 8 although this new approach cannot replace biodosimetry to predict the fluence distribution received by microorganisms it can provide means to characterize more complex reactor designs validate results of advanced reactor modeling and quantify fluence for non parallel irradiation and reflective light especially for the application of high fluence e g advanced oxidation processes where biodosimetry may be too sensitive further comparing the fluence obtained with actinometry to the results of biodosimetry might qualitatively indicate hydraulic short cuts or unideal fluence distributions for flow through reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet irradiation chemical actinometry biodosimetry reflection water treatment 1 introduction photo reactors are used for a wide range of applications ranging from synthesis in the field of chemistry to the treatment of water photo reactors or especially uv reactors are applied in water treatment with the intent of catalytic degradation of contaminants including radical formation in advanced oxidation processes aops or the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms a huge problem in the scale up of photo reactors is that just increasing the reactor dimensions can lead to nonuniform light distributions due to the absorption of light kayahan et al 2020 in the design of photo reactors used in the field of chemical synthesis the estimation of the local volumetric rate of photon absorption lvrpa plays a central role kayahan et al 2020 in contrast to this in photo reactors used to degrade organic micropollutants or to inactivate microorganisms the target might only represent a small fraction of the total absorbance for these reactors the most important design parameter is not the lvrpa but rather the fluence h representing the radiant energy from all sides on a sphere divided by its area reaching the target chemical or pathogen bolton and linden 2003 bolton and stefan 2002 braslavsky 2007 biodosimetry is the most commonly applied method to characterize the fluence or more precisely the reduction equivalent fluence ref in a uv reactor for certifying a uv reactor for water disinfection its disinfection capability needs to be tested using biodosimetry as standard nsf ansi 2019 u s epa 2003 in a biodosimetry experiment the inactivation of a suitable surrogate organism like ms2 phage is measured under the desired conditions i e flow rate uv transmittance the measured inactivation is compared to a fluence response curve pathogen inactivation expressed as the logarithmic removal value lrv as a function of fluence recorded under controlled conditions typically a quasi collimated beam apparatus cba equipped with a calibrated radiometer bolton and linden 2003 nsf ansi 2019 biodosimetry has the advantage that it directly predicts the capability of the reactor to disinfect water sun et al 2022 however major shortcomings include potential variability between laboratories differences between the inactivation of the surrogate organism and the target pathogens in real water limited information about the fluence distribution within the reactor the elevated costs and the effort for the cultivation and analysis of the microorganisms sun et al 2022 in addition the high sensitivity of microorganisms to uv irradiation limits the applicability of biodosimetry for processes that employ high uv fluence e g aops alternative methods for determining fluence in flowing reactors include modeling of uv reactors particle dosimetry using dyed microspheres or the model detector method sun et al 2022 uv reactor modeling can provide information about the distribution of fluence and the optical field without expensive testing jenny et al 2014 jin et al 2005 sun et al 2022 but complex reactor designs still need to be validated using a different approach like biodosimetry sun et al 2022 the dyed microsphere method also called lagrangian actinometry covers particles in the micrometer μm range with a fluorescing actinometer on the particle surface that provides a representation of the fluence distribution in the reactor using flow cytometry but background noise and scavenging by other particles or substances may interfere with the fluorescence determination blatchley et al 2008 sun et al 2022 wols et al 2012 for the model detector method a micro fluorescent silica detector can be used in situ in the uv reactor together with a cfd and optical model to achieve real time fluence monitoring li et al 2011 2017 sun et al 2022 despite the promise of real time and long term monitoring positioning of the sensor can be challenging and uniform fouling for lamp and sleeve are assumed which needs further investigations li et al 2017 sun et al 2022 in the field of water treatment chemical actinometry is mainly applied for calibration of radiometers or fluence determination under highly controlled conditions bolton et al 2011 jin et al 2006 song et al 2018 wang et al 2017 actinometry uses the photolytic reaction of a chemical with a known quantum yield to estimate the photons absorbed in a defined space per time braslavsky 2007 kuhn et al 2004 rabani et al 2021 most actinometers available for liquid phase either measure the decrease of the chemical concentration e g uridine or the stoichiometric formation of a product e g formation of i3 from ki kio3 rabani et al 2021 within the use of an actinometer either all photons should be absorbed or there needs to be detailed knowledge about the absorbance and the solution should be mixed effectively kuhn et al 2004 rabani et al 2021 the current application of chemical actinometry to characterize flow through reactors for water treatment is limited on the one side actinometry is a well suited tool to validate model results at distinct points within a reactor jin et al 2005 or to estimate the fluence or light intensity entering a system which can further be used for instance in the radiative transfer equation to estimate the lvrpa zalazar et al 2005 on the other side complex reactor geometries reflections or non parallel irradiation leading to unknown path lengths of the light traveling through the reactor can cause problems in average fluence determination in addition hydraulic shortcuts leading to reduced disinfection performance might not be detected using actinometry overall the current state of the art using actinometry alone is unable to predict fluence distribution and ref in uv reactors for disinfection sun et al 2022 even though it might not be possible to solve all the challenges of actinometry the aim of this study was to develop an easy and low cost actinometrical procedure which directly estimates the average fluence and effective path length of non parallel and reflective light within uv reactors used for water treatment while not replacing biodosimetry for application in water disinfection the aim was to provide an alternative method for reactor characterization if biodosimetry is not available or too sensitive to fluence e g for aops in addition the method might be applied to predict the performance of mixed reactors under various uv transmittances due to estimated path length identify weaknesses in reactor design and validate optical reactor models 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup uridine and ki kio3 actinometry as well as biodosimetry experiments were conducted under controlled conditions in a cba as described by bolton and linden 2003 the cba consisted of three low pressure mercury lamps uv fresh a001373 philips with a stable output at 254 nm black collimator tubes of different length 65 cm or 30 cm and a polystyrene petri dish with a measured inner diameter of 5 3 cm the petri dish was filled with 0 022 l of sample to reach a water depth of 1 cm and stirred variomag micro stirrer with telemodul 40 c h p labortechnik germany at 190 rpm using a 10 3 mm stir bar covered with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe the irradiance was measured before each experiment and at regular intervals during the experiment with a radiometer uv surface d sglux germany calibrated and plane placed at the same height as the water level of the petri dish it shall be noted that irradiance is referred to as e whereas fluence rate is abbreviated with e in this study as used by bolton and stefan 2002 a detailed list of symbols and abbreviations is provided in the supplementary information to differentiate the fluence rate at the radiometer position and the average fluence within the water sample correction factors according to bolton and linden 2003 were applied when needed according to the refractive indices of water and air a reflection factor rf of 0 98 was used for path lengths of less than 5 cm correction factors for divergence and absorbance can be treated separately hence eq 1 was used for the divergence factor df bolton and linden 2003 1 d f l l l where l equals the distance of the lamps to the water surface and l the path length perpendicular to the lamp of the cell suspension in cm most experiments were conducted with the 65 cm tube and a df of approximately 0 99 l 70 cm l 1 cm only one uridine experiment utilized the shorter tube of 30 cm l 35 cm df 0 97 a petri factor pf of approximately 0 99 was determined with both collimator tubes eq 2 was used to calculate the water factor wf bolton and linden 2003 morowitz 1950 2 w f 1 10 a 254 l i r r a 254 l i r r ln 10 where a 254 represents the decadic absorption coefficient cm 1 at the irradiated wavelength in our case 254 nm and lirr the path length of the light within the solution cm 2 2 experimental procedures to test the effect of reflection on the fluence rate for actinometry and biodosimetry the bottom of the petri dish was modified apart from the standard case without reflection r0 either half r05 or the whole bottom r1 of the petri dish was lined with a 2 mm thick highly diffuse reflective ptfe foil optopolymer berghof fluoroplastic technology gmbh germany the foil showed a reflection of approximately 96 at a wavelength of 254 nm measured by sphereoptics 2021 germany as 8 hemispherical spectral reflectance details are given in the supporting information whereas for specular reflection the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection for diffuse reflection as it is occurring with the ptfe foil light is scattered to all directions berghof fluoroplastic technology gmbh n d u s epa 2003 when half of the petri dish was covered with ptfe the other half was lined with a transparent pvc plate with the same thickness it should be noted that some reflection might occur on other parts than the ptfe foil like the magnetic stir bar or the side walls of the petri dish to test the effect of transmission the solution prior to adding ms2 or actinometer was spiked with 2 62 mg l 1 or 5 72 mg l 1 of humic acids sodium salt ha carl roth germany to reach a transmittance of 85 t85 and 70 t70 respectively if ha was added the blank absorption of ha was subtracted from the absorbance readings for actinometry calculations but the overall absorbance of the solutions was used for wf corrections in fluence determinations in general uridine actinometries were performed in triplicate whereas ki kio3 actinometry and ms2 biodosimetry were performed in single kinetic experiments at selected representative settings results of actinometry were normalized to radiometer readings to correct for daily variations of lamp behavior exposure time for uridine experiments was five times 4 min 36 s and five times 1 min 32 s for ki kio3 for actinometry experiments the fluences were tested in consecutive order after an uv exposure step approximately 3 5 ml of solution were transferred to a silica glass cuvette and absorbance was determined afterward the sample volume was transferred back to the petri dish by using a pipette by weighing the cuvette it was ensured that the sample was completely transferred less than 0 04 g of samples remained in the cuvette for biodosimetry fluences of 13 27 40 and 53 mj cm ² measured with the radiometer and corrected as described by nsf ansi 2019 were tested in randomized order 2 3 uridine actinometry conventional uridine actinometry experiments u1 have been conducted analogous as described by jin et al 2006 and von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 within a 1 mm phosphate buffer pbs a 0 012 mm uridine applichem germany solution was prepared pbs was prepared from potassium chloride merck germany sodium chloride carl roth germany disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate merck germany and sodium dihydrogen phosphate merck germany the ph of the solution was maintained at 7 the uridine degradation during uv exposure was monitored by measuring the change of absorbance at 262 nm by using an aqualog horiba jobin yvon germany following the approach of bolton and stefan 2002 jin et al 2006 and von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 the average fluence rate within the actinometer solution e u1 mw cm 2 was calculated using eq 3 3 e u 1 m w c m 2 ln a 262 0 a 262 t u 2 303 1000 ε u 254 φ 254 t where the term ln a 262 0 a 262 t t represents the slope of the logarithmic absorbance readings at 262 nm plotted over time φ 254 and ε u 254 are the quantum yield 0 0185 mol einstein 1 as will be derived in section 3 2 and the molar absorption coefficient 8820 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm respectively quantum yield per definition describes the number of events over number of photons absorbed and hence is unitless kuhn et al 2004 for better comprehensibility of derived equations the unit as stated by jin et al 2006 of mol number of events einstein 1 number of photons will be kept as it basically renders unitless ε u 254 was determined by multiplying the molar absorption coefficient given by the study of jin et al 2006 with the absorbance at 254 nm normalized to the absorbance at 262 nm measured at three different concentrations 10 185 m 1 cm 1 0 866 8820 m 1 cm 1 uv transmittance of prepared actinometer solution after 1 cm is around 78 and 55 with added ha in highest concentration u is the photon energy at 254 nm which was taken as 4 71 108 mj einstein 1 to calculate the fluence rate at the center and surface of the petri dish e 0 u1 the average fluence rate e u1 from the actinometer must be corrected with rf pf df wf eq 4 further it must be kept in mind that eq 3 is based on a simplification of a taylor series expansion and therefore might be problematic for high absorbances optical path lengths bolton and stefan 2002 jin et al 2006 4

spectrophotometer hach lange germany the fluence rate at the surface of the actinometer solution was calculated using eq 5 based on the studies of bolton et al 2011 jin et al 2006 rahn 1997 and rahn

temperature of the actinometer solution was tracked during the experiment and the quantum yield was corrected according to bolton et al 2011 to calculate the fluence rate at the center of the petri dish the fluence rate was corrected for rf and pf bolton and stefan 2002 eq 6 as the actinometer has an absorption coefficient of 100 cm 1 müller et al 2017 correction for wf and df is not needed as all photons are absorbed directly at the surface 6 e 0 k i k i o 3 m w c m 2 e k i k i o 3 p f r f 2 5 biodosimetry to verify the actinometry results for the disinfection efficiency biodosimetry was performed using ms2 phage dsm 13 767 phage were plated using the double agar technique as described in nsf ansi 2019 using e coli dsm 5210 as host strain to compare the actinometry results for biodosimetry the normalized fluence rates found with actinometry were multiplied with the radiometer reading during biodosimetry and corrected for the relevant factors 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of transmittance and reflection on chemical actinometry to facilitate comparison of actinometry results in different experiments fluence rates at the center and surface of the petri dish e o were determined using eqs 3 6 and normalized using radiometer readings from the respective experiment results of the ki kio3 actinometer were not affected by the degree of reflection with normalized fluence rates of 1 08 r0 1 10 r05 and 1 10 r1 as expected due to the complete absorbance of photons before the light could penetrate to the reflective parts therefore the ki kio3 actinometer results represent the total irradiance input power to the solution e0 only considering radiant power from an upwind direction and not the average fluence rate e 0 the adjustment of transmittance with 5 72 mg l 1 of ha t70 to the non reflective case r0 showed only a negligible influence normalized fluence rate of 1 06 this is likely caused by the high absorbance of the actinometer a254 100 cm 1 in comparison to the one of ha a254 1 cm 1 leading to less than 1 of the light being absorbed by the ha and hence not considerably influencing results overall the results fit well with the radiometer reading with a minor overestimation 1 08 0 02 to increase comparability to other studies the radiometer readings from now on were multiplied with 1 08 as calibration bolton et al 2011 in comparison to the ki kio3 actinometry the results from uridine exhibit significantly enhanced normalized fluence rates e 0 u1 when reflection of the petri dish was increased to 50 and 100 fig 1 the fluence rates at the surface and center of the petri dish e 0 u1 were calculated from average fluence rates determined by the actinometer e u1 using eq 4 however whereas e 0 u1 in the setting without reflections was comparable for different solution transmittance values adjusted by addition of ha decreasing transmittance led to decreased e 0 u1 fluence rates in a reflective petri dish the effect of solution transmittance was corrected for using the wf in eq 2 with a path length of 1 cm the larger deviations for higher reflection scenarios indicate that the effective path length is increased and the wf correction assuming a 1 cm pathlength is not suitable in those cases to compare the actinometry results with biodosimetry the incident irradiance radiometer readings from individual biodosimetry experiments were multiplied by irradiation time and the normalized fluence rates from actinometry as well as corrected for rf df pf and wf for 1 cm path length to determine the average fluence in the completely mixed water sample when using the ki kio3 actinometer for fluence determination the measured lrvs for the non reflective cases t100 r0 and t70 r0 mostly lie within the quality control qc of nsf ansi 2019 as soon as reflections are introduced the measured lrvs are higher than the qc of nsf ansi 2019 for the estimated fluence h ki kio3 fig 2 a this demonstrates that fully absorbing actinometers like ki kio3 are not suitable to characterize uv reactors with reflections as they are not affected by the effective path lengths of the light furthermore non parallel light could lead to a similar phenomenon as seen with reflections longer or shorter path lengths of the light traveling through the water body can lead to changed inactivation but might not be detected due to high absorbance the lrvs of t70 r0 are slightly higher than for t100 r0 but this might be explained by uncertainties of the biodosimetry itself correction of radiometer readings during biodosimetry with normalized fluence rates from uridine actinometry considerably reduced differences between the measured lrvs and the estimated fluence h u1 fig 2b as additional reference the red dotted line standard case represents the fitted linear model of lrv vs the fluence determined using ki kio3 for t100 r0 and extrapolated to higher fluences for experiments with the reflective petri dish the lrvs from biodosimetry are still slightly higher than qc of nsf55 nsf ansi 2019 at the estimated fluences with uridine but already close to the standard case this effect can be explained by the uv absorbance of the added ha and the actinometer itself aside from the simplification using a taylor series in eq 3 the correction with wf is not adequately addressed to calculate e 0 u1 from the average fluence within the actinometer solution e u1 eq 4 the changed path length of the light traveling through the medium after introducing reflections is needed 3 2 uridine actinometry correction with effective path length to determine the effective path length of the light traveling through the solution an optimized procedure u2 was developed based on previous studies maafi and maafi 2013 2015 pousty et al 2022 roibu et al 2018 uridine experiments with different reflections were repeated with two additional uridine concentrations 5 0 012 mm 0 06 mm and 9 0 012 mm 0 108 mm the selected concentrations lead to equality distanced a254 values of uridine with differences of 0 42 cm 1 uv transmittances for 1 cm is around 30 for 0 06 and 11 for 0 108 mm solution until recently it was assumed that during the degradation of uridine no photoproduct with considerable absorbance in germicidal wavelength is formed rabani et al 2021 von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 however pousty et al 2022 observed a photoproduct absorbing at 254 and 262 nm as described in their study the photoproduct can be quantified when irradiating with high enough fluence until no change in absorbance can be detected anymore as shown in the supplementary information the found photoproduct exhibits a molar absorption coefficient of 8 at 254 nm and 6 at 262 nm compared to the one of uridine to encounter the effect of the formed photoproduct and instead of applying eq 3 based on a taylor series simplification mathematical analysis followed a semi empirical model for a unimolecular photodegradation with the formed product showing an absorbance at irradiated and observed wavelength maafi and maafi 2013 2015 deduction of eq 7 and recommendations for calculations are reported in the supplementary information 7 l n

should include corrections for wf and df to determine the average irradiance the average irradiance directly below the surface of the water in the petri dish eu2 mw cm 2 can be calculated from photon flux using the photon energy u and the surface area in order to get the irradiance at the center and on the water surface as it is measured with the radiometer e0 u2 mw cm 2 the correction of pf and rf need to be considered additionally eq 10 and 11 10 e 0 u 2 m w c m 2 q 0 254 u a p f r f 11 e 0 u 2 m w c m 2 v s l o p e u ε u 254 l i r r φ 254 a p f r f eq 11 was also solved for quantum yield and the quantum yields calculated for the three uridine concentrations for case without reflection and using a l i r r 1 cm results are 0 0185 0 0012 0 0201 0 006 and 0 0208 0 007 mol einstein 1 for the concentrations of 0 012 0 06 and und 0 108 mm respectively those values are similar to the study of jin et al 2006 however interesting to note is the increase of quantum yield with concentration this could possibly be caused by reversal of degradation being more prominent at lower concentrations such reversal was suspected to cause changes of quantum yield at lower irradiances linden and darby 1997 for the determination of the fluence rate at the center and surface of the petri dish the irradiance from eq 11 needs to be transformed to account for the effective volume v e f f a l i r r resulting in eq 12 the factor 1000 is caused by conversion of l to cm³ the newly proposed eq 12 allows direct calculation of fluence rate e 0 u2 and effective path length lirr slope of lhs from eq 7 this can be an enormous advantage in complex reactor designs with unknown surface area and volume as a note for calculating the average fluence rate in a reactor volume e u2 rather than the fluence rate at the center and surface of the petri dish dividing by pf and rf needs to be skipped 12 e 0 u 2 m w c m 2 e 0 u 2 v e f f v s l o p e u ε 254 φ 254 1000 p f r f analogous to roibu et al 2018 the three equations from different uridine concentrations were used to solve the two unknown variables e 0 u2 and l i r r within each case of reflection the effective path length l i r r is assumed to be constant e 0 u2 can be assumed constant for the duration of an experiment or like in our case to encounter small variations the fluence rate e 0 u2 normalized to the radiometer reading was assumed to be constant the irradiated path lengths in eqs 7 8 and 12 were varied over a range of 0 5 to 5 cm with a step size of 0 01 cm the effective path length in the water was identified by minimizing standard deviation of normalized e 0 u2 for the three uridine concentrations the behavior of lhs in eq 7 as well as the standard deviation of normalized e 0 u2 over path length changes during computation is visualized in figure s3 and s4 in the supplementary information for the three reflective cases e 0 u2 and the average effective light path length are shown in fig 3 e0 u2 is also depicted calculated using eq 11 and the found effective path length expressed as l i r r whereas for r0 effective path lengths is around 1 cm path lengths for 50 reflection r05 and 100 reflection r1 are 1 83 and 2 40 cm respectively which implies an increase by roughly a factor of 1 84 for r05 and 2 41 for r1 this high increase can be explained by the diffuse reflection in the case of a beam perpendicular to the bottom of the petri dish that is being specular reflected path length would double in case of diffuse reflection having a broad range of reflection angles the path length can more than double as for instance a light beam at the right side of the petri dish could be reflected by 30 to the left side traveling a longer distance through the solution the estimated irradiance at the center and surface of the petri dish e0 u2 shows similar results for the two reflective scenarios close to the radiometer readings this further supports the validity of the set up eq 11 as q 0 254 represents the photons coming from the lamp to the solution input power the average increase of e 0 u2 between the different reflections is similar as the increase in effective path length factors of 1 84 and 2 57 for r05 and r1 respectively experiments in this study were conducted at relatively low irradiance of approximately 0 1 mw cm ² radiometer readings linden and darby 1997 observed a changed quantum yield of uridine below a fluence rate of 0 4 mw cm ² which might have been caused by longer exposure time under the heat of the uv lamp leading to a reversing of the degradation therefore the experiments with three different concentrations without reflection were repeated with a shorter collimator tube of 30 cm and an irradiance of approximately 0 5 mw cm ² following the same approach as described above an effective path length of 0 98 cm was determined with normalized irradiance e0 u2 and fluence rate e 0 u2 of 1 12 and 1 10 the results are slightly higher which could indicate higher quantum yields of 0 021 0 022 and 0 023 mol einstein 1 for the three concentrations 0 012 0 06 and 0 108 mm even though quantum yields in general seemed to be increased the same trend of higher quantum yield with higher concentration can be seen 3 3 correction of uridine actinometry for different transmittance and reflection the estimated effective path lengths were used for wf correction eq 2 4 to determine the fluence rate at the center and surface of the petri dish in experiments with different transmittance and reflections fig 4 using this correction no significant differences were found for various transmittances within the three cases of reflection p values of one way anova testing were 0 28 for all cases the corrected fluence rates for the reflective cases are slightly higher compared to wf correction with 1 cm and similar to the e 0 u2 from experiments with different uridine concentrations following this approach df correction was not included in eq 3 as its behavior with the diffuse reflections is not known and it was assumed that the df factor is already included in the calculated average path length the df for field reactor applications is not of great importance as the fluence in the water body and not that emitted from the lamp is of interest overall the findings support that the calculated effective path lengths represent the real average path lengths and that e 0 u2 indicates the actual average fluence rate in reflecting uv reactors average fluence rates in biodosimetry experiments were now determined from normalized e 0 u2 values as shown in fig 3 multiplied with the radiometer readings during the biodosimetry and corrected for wf with the use of l i r r pf and rf using the corrected fluence rates the determined lrvs lie within the qc fig 5 a and close to the curve of the standard case linear model of lrv vs fluence determined with ki kio3 for case t100 r0 extrapolated to higher fluences further confirming validity of the fluence rate adjustments the correlation of the slope of lrv over irradiation time kms2 and the average fluence rate estimated using e 0 u2 also confirms the strong similarity of results across different transmittance and reflection scenarios fig 5b while this new method showed promising results for the evaluated settings it still needs to be validated for flow through systems in practice several different ways to conduct the actinometry for flow through systems might be possible but recirculation of the actinometer solution as described by zalazar et al 2005 seems promising in summary a simple setup includes the uv reactor a storage tank with the possibility of sampling a pump and a heat exchanger using this setup stable temperature large recirculation rates sufficient mixing and small conversion per pass should be ensured in addition the volume of the uv reactor should be considerably smaller than the volume of recirculated solution under those conditions irradiation time in eq 7 might be estimated by multiplying the recirculation time with the ratio of uv reactor volume to total volume of actinometer solution the actinometry in recycling mode has been applied by the authors in another study with promising results sperle et al this study in review for a comprehensive validation of the actinometric method it is recommended to validate a cfd and optical model with results of biodosimetry and compare the results of average fluence rate with actinometry for further improvement investigation of the optimal uridine concentrations is important similarly as described by roibu et al 2018 a high absorbance of the light under a specified uridine actinometer concentration could lead to lower influence of the path length on degradation of the actinometer as most of the light has already vanished after a short distance similar to the extreme case of the ki kio3 actinometer this effect might be minimized for instance by ensuring that the highest uridine concentration still shows a transmittance of at least 10 for the average path length to additionally validate the estimated path lengths another experiment with a higher water depth was performed and is shown in the supporting information water depth could be well estimated when using polychromatic irradiation coefficients used in the calculation might need to be weighted by the relative spectral output as described by roibu et al 2018 and the calculations would be more complex due to the variation of the germicidal action of wavelengths additional points to consider are the effects of evaluated temperatures or behavior of the quantum yield at the boarders of uridine absorbance λ 280 nm besides the current study applied a maximum fluence estimated directly with the radiometer h 0 radio of 740 mj cm 2 as aop processes might be conducted in the range of 1000 mj cm 2 roback et al 2021 another run with the 0 012 mm concentration and the long collimator tube was performed after irradiation with 2600 mj cm 2 calculated normalized irradiance e0 u2 and fluence rate e 0 u2 were 1 10 and 1 11 with a path length of 1 cm this indicates that the method should be suitable for aop processes but the slight increase might be caused by a change in quantum yield according to linden and darby 1997 quantum yield should not change at irradiances higher than 0 4 mw cm 2 so probably the values derived with the short collimator tube should be applicable for studies with higher intensities still it is advised to additionally investigate and validate the behavior of quantum yield at different fluences and fluence rates coupled with more extreme temperatures and over varying uridine concentrations 3 4 implications for practice it was shown that the estimated fluence rate e 0 u2 with the estimated path length is a well suited tool to predict the inactivation of ms2 phage for the diffusely reflected uv irradiation in the cba setting for real reactors however the actinometry might indicate the average fluence but as it is not predicting the fluence distribution received by microorganisms it cannot replace biodosimetry for water disinfection nevertheless the proposed actinometry can provide valuable information and has several implications for practice 3 4 1 simple method to characterize alternative lab scale uv reactors standardized cba with parallel light and well defined path length is not accessible for researchers worldwide in addition boundary conditions e g the integration into treatment concepts or the need of larger sample volumes may require the utilization of alternative reactor designs for a full characterization of such reactors labor and time intense biodosimetry is required the new method to determine the effective path length and average fluence rate of the reactor is cost effective does not require handling of toxic chemicals and is fast to implement in addition biodosimetry might be too sensitive for reactor characterization e g when applying high fluences as in uv aops further with knowledge about the effective path length of the light it might be possible to calculate the average fluence rate for different water matrixes and transmittances predicting the inactivation performance for the cba setting worked well but it must be considered that a correction for wf assumes a completely mixed solution bolton and linden 2003 morowitz 1950 which might not always be the case in real reactors in lab scale operation this limitation might be overcome by recycling the water through the reactor to ensure equal exposure to uv light however future experiments are needed to determine required recycling rates and validate the wf correction for the average fluence for flow through reactors and for reflections with longer path lengths 3 4 2 fluence determination for non parallel light sources and reflective reactors it should be emphasized that it was possible to predict the fluence under diffuse reflection and therefore also non parallel light this is extremely helpful for examining the fluence when using light sources such as uv leds where quasi collimation might not be achieved due to patterned light output non parallel light can cause problems for radiometer measurements and any increased path length within a reactor could lead to varied disinfection performance in addition for a given reactor the ratio of fluence rate to irradiance could be used to quantitatively estimate the degree of reflection or gain in efficiency due to reflections and path length increases furthermore when reflections are used in an industrial reactor the proposed method might be able to detect if fouling of reflective parts is occurring 3 4 3 characterization of flow through reactors by combining actinometry with hydraulic reactor and optical field modeling the modeling of complex reactor geometries requires validation sun et al 2022 next to biodosimetry the proposed method could serve as an alternative for model validation being easy and fast to implement without expensive testing facilities both average fluence rate as well as the optical path length could be parameters for model comparison with a validated model the inactivation of microorganisms under different water qualities might be predicted 3 4 4 qualitatively characterize the fluence distribution in full scale reactors together with the results of biodosimetry additional information about the reactor performance and possible strategies to enhance future design can be gained by comparing the fluence estimated with the uridine actinometry using three different uridine concentrations h u2 and the measured inactivation of ms2 at a certain fluence flowrate it is possible to check if the fluence distribution is behaving similarly as in a cba the ratio of ref and average fluence h u2 can be seen as mixing efficiency eq 13 a figure of merit for the quality of fluence distribution further described by bolton and cotton 2022 and usually calculated by modeling the reactor to calculate mixing efficiency a certain fluence ηh a linear model or an interpolation might be used to predict the lrv at a design fluence if lrv kinetics over several fluences was recorded but not at the fluence of interest e g predict the lrv at 40 mj cm 2 by an interpolation of the lrv at 30 and 50 mj cm 2 from this lrv the ref can be calculated using the ms2 inactivation kinetics under standard conditions in a cba for wavelengths other than 254 nm actinometry results might need correction for germicidal efficiency as compared to 254 nm a ηh of 1 indicates equal or better fluence distribution as in a cba likely the best case possible whereas ηh considerably smaller than 1 can indicate hydraulic shortcuts or an unequal fluence distribution occurring in an uv reactor the investigated settings of reflection and transmittance showed an average η40 of 1 02 0 09 at a fluence of 40 mj cm 2 indicating that in all the experiments the fluence is equally distributed to the phage as it is suspected as they were performed in a mixed petri dish overall ηh can be seen as the efficiency to transfer the light energy within the reactor to the microorganisms maximizing ηh is a primary goal of engineers designing uv reactors bolton and cotton 2022 however it should be noted that changing absorbance of the water might also change ηh values in a reactor as part of the streamlines might receive significantly less irradiation 13 η h r e f h u 2 4 conclusion this study assessed the ability of chemical actinometry to account for effects of reflections and water transmittance in a completely mixed batch reactor under a collimated beam apparatus the following main conclusions can be drawn knowledge about the path length of the light is essential for conventional and the optimized actinometry the developed actinometry demonstrated an easy and fast method to not only quantify irradiance and path length but also by the newly proposed eq 12 to accurately calculate average fluence rate in completely mixed batch uvc reactors used for water treatment without needing any prior knowledge of surface area or volume the proposed method to predict the average fluence could be validated by biodosimetry using ms2 phage in a cba setting for different degrees of transmittance and reflection and can be expected to also apply to non parallel light sources such as those emitted by uv leds nevertheless the method needs to be additionally validated in flow through and industry standard reactors the estimated average fluence rate could provide valuable information for all uv reactors for water treatment but could be especially useful where biodosimetry is too sensitive e g uv aop processes to enhance results attributes of uridine should be validated over diverse fluence rate ranges uridine concentrations and more extreme temperatures the optimized actinometry method is not designed to determine fluence distribution in reactors used for water disinfection but could be used for model validation and a first performance estimation using the new actinometric method together with biodosimetry mixing efficiency might be directly calculated without modeling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15167,the applicability of chemical actinometry to characterize the fluence in uv reactors with reflections non parallel light and variable water transmittance is limited due to the unknown effective path length or hydraulic shortcuts within the reactor in this study the effects of reflection and transmittance on actinometry were examined and a new optimized and easy method for determining fluence was developed ki kio3 and uridine actinometry experiments were carried out under controlled conditions using a collimated beam apparatus and a completely mixed batch reactor with or without diffuse reflection and compared to biodosimetry results whereas optically opaque actinometers such as ki kio3 are not directly capable of predicting the fluence of reflecting reactors the results of uridine actinometry are influenced by reflection and transmission to precisely predict the fluence rate in uv reactors with uridine knowledge about the effective optical path length of the light is needed here an existing method to mathematically calculate the optical path length was adopted and optimized for uridine actinometry results for average fluence were validated by biodosimetry using ms2 phages under different degrees of reflection and transmission it could be shown that by modifying the bottom of the reactor with diffusely reflecting polytetrafluoroethylene foil the fluence rate was increased by a factor of approximately 2 6 and the path length by factor of 2 4 when only half of the bottom was covered with reflective foil fluence rate increased by a factor of 1 8 and path length by 1 8 although this new approach cannot replace biodosimetry to predict the fluence distribution received by microorganisms it can provide means to characterize more complex reactor designs validate results of advanced reactor modeling and quantify fluence for non parallel irradiation and reflective light especially for the application of high fluence e g advanced oxidation processes where biodosimetry may be too sensitive further comparing the fluence obtained with actinometry to the results of biodosimetry might qualitatively indicate hydraulic short cuts or unideal fluence distributions for flow through reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet irradiation chemical actinometry biodosimetry reflection water treatment 1 introduction photo reactors are used for a wide range of applications ranging from synthesis in the field of chemistry to the treatment of water photo reactors or especially uv reactors are applied in water treatment with the intent of catalytic degradation of contaminants including radical formation in advanced oxidation processes aops or the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms a huge problem in the scale up of photo reactors is that just increasing the reactor dimensions can lead to nonuniform light distributions due to the absorption of light kayahan et al 2020 in the design of photo reactors used in the field of chemical synthesis the estimation of the local volumetric rate of photon absorption lvrpa plays a central role kayahan et al 2020 in contrast to this in photo reactors used to degrade organic micropollutants or to inactivate microorganisms the target might only represent a small fraction of the total absorbance for these reactors the most important design parameter is not the lvrpa but rather the fluence h representing the radiant energy from all sides on a sphere divided by its area reaching the target chemical or pathogen bolton and linden 2003 bolton and stefan 2002 braslavsky 2007 biodosimetry is the most commonly applied method to characterize the fluence or more precisely the reduction equivalent fluence ref in a uv reactor for certifying a uv reactor for water disinfection its disinfection capability needs to be tested using biodosimetry as standard nsf ansi 2019 u s epa 2003 in a biodosimetry experiment the inactivation of a suitable surrogate organism like ms2 phage is measured under the desired conditions i e flow rate uv transmittance the measured inactivation is compared to a fluence response curve pathogen inactivation expressed as the logarithmic removal value lrv as a function of fluence recorded under controlled conditions typically a quasi collimated beam apparatus cba equipped with a calibrated radiometer bolton and linden 2003 nsf ansi 2019 biodosimetry has the advantage that it directly predicts the capability of the reactor to disinfect water sun et al 2022 however major shortcomings include potential variability between laboratories differences between the inactivation of the surrogate organism and the target pathogens in real water limited information about the fluence distribution within the reactor the elevated costs and the effort for the cultivation and analysis of the microorganisms sun et al 2022 in addition the high sensitivity of microorganisms to uv irradiation limits the applicability of biodosimetry for processes that employ high uv fluence e g aops alternative methods for determining fluence in flowing reactors include modeling of uv reactors particle dosimetry using dyed microspheres or the model detector method sun et al 2022 uv reactor modeling can provide information about the distribution of fluence and the optical field without expensive testing jenny et al 2014 jin et al 2005 sun et al 2022 but complex reactor designs still need to be validated using a different approach like biodosimetry sun et al 2022 the dyed microsphere method also called lagrangian actinometry covers particles in the micrometer μm range with a fluorescing actinometer on the particle surface that provides a representation of the fluence distribution in the reactor using flow cytometry but background noise and scavenging by other particles or substances may interfere with the fluorescence determination blatchley et al 2008 sun et al 2022 wols et al 2012 for the model detector method a micro fluorescent silica detector can be used in situ in the uv reactor together with a cfd and optical model to achieve real time fluence monitoring li et al 2011 2017 sun et al 2022 despite the promise of real time and long term monitoring positioning of the sensor can be challenging and uniform fouling for lamp and sleeve are assumed which needs further investigations li et al 2017 sun et al 2022 in the field of water treatment chemical actinometry is mainly applied for calibration of radiometers or fluence determination under highly controlled conditions bolton et al 2011 jin et al 2006 song et al 2018 wang et al 2017 actinometry uses the photolytic reaction of a chemical with a known quantum yield to estimate the photons absorbed in a defined space per time braslavsky 2007 kuhn et al 2004 rabani et al 2021 most actinometers available for liquid phase either measure the decrease of the chemical concentration e g uridine or the stoichiometric formation of a product e g formation of i3 from ki kio3 rabani et al 2021 within the use of an actinometer either all photons should be absorbed or there needs to be detailed knowledge about the absorbance and the solution should be mixed effectively kuhn et al 2004 rabani et al 2021 the current application of chemical actinometry to characterize flow through reactors for water treatment is limited on the one side actinometry is a well suited tool to validate model results at distinct points within a reactor jin et al 2005 or to estimate the fluence or light intensity entering a system which can further be used for instance in the radiative transfer equation to estimate the lvrpa zalazar et al 2005 on the other side complex reactor geometries reflections or non parallel irradiation leading to unknown path lengths of the light traveling through the reactor can cause problems in average fluence determination in addition hydraulic shortcuts leading to reduced disinfection performance might not be detected using actinometry overall the current state of the art using actinometry alone is unable to predict fluence distribution and ref in uv reactors for disinfection sun et al 2022 even though it might not be possible to solve all the challenges of actinometry the aim of this study was to develop an easy and low cost actinometrical procedure which directly estimates the average fluence and effective path length of non parallel and reflective light within uv reactors used for water treatment while not replacing biodosimetry for application in water disinfection the aim was to provide an alternative method for reactor characterization if biodosimetry is not available or too sensitive to fluence e g for aops in addition the method might be applied to predict the performance of mixed reactors under various uv transmittances due to estimated path length identify weaknesses in reactor design and validate optical reactor models 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup uridine and ki kio3 actinometry as well as biodosimetry experiments were conducted under controlled conditions in a cba as described by bolton and linden 2003 the cba consisted of three low pressure mercury lamps uv fresh a001373 philips with a stable output at 254 nm black collimator tubes of different length 65 cm or 30 cm and a polystyrene petri dish with a measured inner diameter of 5 3 cm the petri dish was filled with 0 022 l of sample to reach a water depth of 1 cm and stirred variomag micro stirrer with telemodul 40 c h p labortechnik germany at 190 rpm using a 10 3 mm stir bar covered with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe the irradiance was measured before each experiment and at regular intervals during the experiment with a radiometer uv surface d sglux germany calibrated and plane placed at the same height as the water level of the petri dish it shall be noted that irradiance is referred to as e whereas fluence rate is abbreviated with e in this study as used by bolton and stefan 2002 a detailed list of symbols and abbreviations is provided in the supplementary information to differentiate the fluence rate at the radiometer position and the average fluence within the water sample correction factors according to bolton and linden 2003 were applied when needed according to the refractive indices of water and air a reflection factor rf of 0 98 was used for path lengths of less than 5 cm correction factors for divergence and absorbance can be treated separately hence eq 1 was used for the divergence factor df bolton and linden 2003 1 d f l l l where l equals the distance of the lamps to the water surface and l the path length perpendicular to the lamp of the cell suspension in cm most experiments were conducted with the 65 cm tube and a df of approximately 0 99 l 70 cm l 1 cm only one uridine experiment utilized the shorter tube of 30 cm l 35 cm df 0 97 a petri factor pf of approximately 0 99 was determined with both collimator tubes eq 2 was used to calculate the water factor wf bolton and linden 2003 morowitz 1950 2 w f 1 10 a 254 l i r r a 254 l i r r ln 10 where a 254 represents the decadic absorption coefficient cm 1 at the irradiated wavelength in our case 254 nm and lirr the path length of the light within the solution cm 2 2 experimental procedures to test the effect of reflection on the fluence rate for actinometry and biodosimetry the bottom of the petri dish was modified apart from the standard case without reflection r0 either half r05 or the whole bottom r1 of the petri dish was lined with a 2 mm thick highly diffuse reflective ptfe foil optopolymer berghof fluoroplastic technology gmbh germany the foil showed a reflection of approximately 96 at a wavelength of 254 nm measured by sphereoptics 2021 germany as 8 hemispherical spectral reflectance details are given in the supporting information whereas for specular reflection the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection for diffuse reflection as it is occurring with the ptfe foil light is scattered to all directions berghof fluoroplastic technology gmbh n d u s epa 2003 when half of the petri dish was covered with ptfe the other half was lined with a transparent pvc plate with the same thickness it should be noted that some reflection might occur on other parts than the ptfe foil like the magnetic stir bar or the side walls of the petri dish to test the effect of transmission the solution prior to adding ms2 or actinometer was spiked with 2 62 mg l 1 or 5 72 mg l 1 of humic acids sodium salt ha carl roth germany to reach a transmittance of 85 t85 and 70 t70 respectively if ha was added the blank absorption of ha was subtracted from the absorbance readings for actinometry calculations but the overall absorbance of the solutions was used for wf corrections in fluence determinations in general uridine actinometries were performed in triplicate whereas ki kio3 actinometry and ms2 biodosimetry were performed in single kinetic experiments at selected representative settings results of actinometry were normalized to radiometer readings to correct for daily variations of lamp behavior exposure time for uridine experiments was five times 4 min 36 s and five times 1 min 32 s for ki kio3 for actinometry experiments the fluences were tested in consecutive order after an uv exposure step approximately 3 5 ml of solution were transferred to a silica glass cuvette and absorbance was determined afterward the sample volume was transferred back to the petri dish by using a pipette by weighing the cuvette it was ensured that the sample was completely transferred less than 0 04 g of samples remained in the cuvette for biodosimetry fluences of 13 27 40 and 53 mj cm ² measured with the radiometer and corrected as described by nsf ansi 2019 were tested in randomized order 2 3 uridine actinometry conventional uridine actinometry experiments u1 have been conducted analogous as described by jin et al 2006 and von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 within a 1 mm phosphate buffer pbs a 0 012 mm uridine applichem germany solution was prepared pbs was prepared from potassium chloride merck germany sodium chloride carl roth germany disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate merck germany and sodium dihydrogen phosphate merck germany the ph of the solution was maintained at 7 the uridine degradation during uv exposure was monitored by measuring the change of absorbance at 262 nm by using an aqualog horiba jobin yvon germany following the approach of bolton and stefan 2002 jin et al 2006 and von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 the average fluence rate within the actinometer solution e u1 mw cm 2 was calculated using eq 3 3 e u 1 m w c m 2 ln a 262 0 a 262 t u 2 303 1000 ε u 254 φ 254 t where the term ln a 262 0 a 262 t t represents the slope of the logarithmic absorbance readings at 262 nm plotted over time φ 254 and ε u 254 are the quantum yield 0 0185 mol einstein 1 as will be derived in section 3 2 and the molar absorption coefficient 8820 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm respectively quantum yield per definition describes the number of events over number of photons absorbed and hence is unitless kuhn et al 2004 for better comprehensibility of derived equations the unit as stated by jin et al 2006 of mol number of events einstein 1 number of photons will be kept as it basically renders unitless ε u 254 was determined by multiplying the molar absorption coefficient given by the study of jin et al 2006 with the absorbance at 254 nm normalized to the absorbance at 262 nm measured at three different concentrations 10 185 m 1 cm 1 0 866

einstein 1 to calculate the fluence rate at the center and surface of the petri dish e 0 u1 the average fluence rate e u1 from the actinometer must be corrected with rf pf df wf eq 4 further it must be kept in mind that eq 3 is based on a simplification of a taylor series expansion and therefore might be problematic for high absorbances optical path lengths bolton and stefan 2002 jin et al 2006 4

spectrophotometer hach lange germany the fluence rate at the surface of the actinometer solution was calculated using eq 5 based on the studies of bolton et al 2011 jin et al 2006 rahn 1997 and rahn

temperature of the actinometer solution was tracked during the experiment and the quantum yield was corrected according to bolton et al 2011 to calculate the fluence rate at the center of the petri dish the fluence rate was corrected for rf and pf bolton and stefan 2002 eq 6 as the actinometer has an absorption coefficient of 100 cm 1 müller et al 2017 correction for wf and df is not needed as all photons are absorbed directly at the surface 6 e 0 k i k i o 3 m w c m 2 e k i k i o 3 p f r f 2 5 biodosimetry to verify the actinometry results for the disinfection efficiency biodosimetry was performed using ms2 phage dsm 13 767 phage were plated using the double agar technique as described in nsf ansi 2019 using e coli dsm 5210 as host strain to compare the actinometry results for biodosimetry the normalized fluence rates found with actinometry were multiplied with the radiometer reading during biodosimetry and corrected for the relevant factors 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of transmittance and reflection on chemical actinometry to facilitate comparison of actinometry results in different experiments fluence rates at the center and surface of the petri dish e o were determined using eqs 3 6 and normalized using radiometer readings from the respective experiment results of the ki kio3 actinometer were not affected by the degree of reflection with normalized fluence rates of 1 08 r0 1 10 r05 and 1 10 r1 as expected due to the complete absorbance of photons before the light could penetrate to the reflective parts therefore the ki kio3 actinometer results represent the total irradiance input power to the solution e0 only considering radiant power from an upwind direction and not the average fluence rate e 0 the adjustment of transmittance with 5 72 mg l 1 of ha t70 to the non reflective case r0 showed only a negligible influence normalized fluence rate of 1 06 this is likely caused by the high absorbance of the actinometer a254 100 cm 1 in comparison to the one of ha a254 1 cm 1 leading to less than 1 of the light being absorbed by the ha and hence not considerably influencing results overall the results fit well with the radiometer reading with a minor overestimation 1 08 0 02 to increase comparability to other studies the radiometer readings from now on were multiplied with 1 08 as calibration bolton et al 2011 in comparison to the ki kio3 actinometry the results from uridine exhibit significantly enhanced normalized fluence rates e 0 u1 when reflection of the petri dish was increased to 50 and 100 fig 1 the fluence rates at the surface and center of the petri dish e 0 u1 were calculated from average fluence rates determined by the actinometer e u1 using eq 4 however whereas e 0 u1 in the setting without reflections was comparable for different solution transmittance values adjusted by addition of ha decreasing transmittance led to decreased e 0 u1 fluence rates in a reflective petri dish the effect of solution transmittance was corrected for using the wf in eq 2 with a path length of 1 cm the larger deviations for higher reflection scenarios indicate that the effective path length is increased and the wf correction assuming a 1 cm pathlength is not suitable in those cases to compare the actinometry results with biodosimetry the incident irradiance radiometer readings from individual biodosimetry experiments were multiplied by irradiation time and the normalized fluence rates from actinometry as well as corrected for rf df pf and wf for 1 cm path length to determine the average fluence in the completely mixed water sample when using the ki kio3 actinometer for fluence determination the measured lrvs for the non reflective cases t100 r0 and t70 r0 mostly lie within the quality control qc of nsf ansi 2019 as soon as reflections are introduced the measured lrvs are higher than the qc of nsf ansi 2019 for the estimated fluence h ki kio3 fig 2 a this demonstrates that fully absorbing actinometers like ki kio3 are not suitable to characterize uv reactors with reflections as they are not affected by the effective path lengths of the light furthermore non parallel light could lead to a similar phenomenon as seen with reflections longer or shorter path lengths of the light traveling through the water body can lead to changed inactivation but might not be detected due to high absorbance the lrvs of t70 r0 are slightly higher than for t100 r0 but this might be explained by uncertainties of the biodosimetry itself correction of radiometer readings during biodosimetry with normalized fluence rates from uridine actinometry considerably reduced differences between the measured lrvs and the estimated fluence h u1 fig 2b as additional reference the red dotted line standard case represents the fitted linear model of lrv vs the fluence determined using ki kio3 for t100 r0 and extrapolated to higher fluences for experiments with the reflective petri dish the lrvs from biodosimetry are still slightly higher than qc of nsf55 nsf ansi 2019 at the estimated fluences with uridine but already close to the standard case this effect can be explained by the uv absorbance of the added ha and the actinometer itself aside from the simplification using a taylor series in eq 3 the correction with wf is not adequately addressed to calculate e 0 u1 from the average fluence within the actinometer solution e u1 eq 4 the changed path length of the light traveling through the medium after introducing reflections is needed 3 2 uridine actinometry correction with effective path length to determine the effective path length of the light traveling through the solution an optimized procedure u2 was developed based on previous studies maafi and maafi 2013 2015 pousty et al 2022 roibu et al 2018 uridine experiments with different reflections were repeated with two additional uridine concentrations 5 0 012 mm 0 06 mm and 9 0 012 mm 0 108 mm the selected concentrations lead to equality distanced a254 values of uridine with differences of 0 42 cm 1 uv transmittances for 1 cm is around 30 for 0 06 and 11 for 0 108 mm solution until recently it was assumed that during the degradation of uridine no photoproduct with considerable absorbance in germicidal wavelength is formed rabani et al 2021 von sonntag and schuchmann 1992 however pousty et al 2022 observed a photoproduct absorbing at 254 and 262 nm as described in their study the photoproduct can be quantified when irradiating with high enough fluence until no change in absorbance can be detected anymore as shown in the supplementary information the found photoproduct exhibits a molar absorption coefficient of 8 at 254 nm and 6 at 262 nm compared to the one of uridine to encounter the effect of the formed photoproduct and instead of applying eq 3 based on a taylor series simplification mathematical analysis followed a semi empirical model for a unimolecular photodegradation with the formed

should include corrections for wf and df to determine the average irradiance the average irradiance directly below the surface of the water in the petri dish eu2 mw cm 2 can be calculated from photon flux using the photon energy u and the surface area in order to get the irradiance at the center and on the water surface as it is measured with the radiometer e0 u2 mw cm 2 the correction of pf and rf need to be considered additionally eq 10 and 11 10 e 0 u 2 m w c m 2 q 0 254 u a p f r f 11 e 0 u 2 m w c m 2 v s l o p e u ε u 254 l i r r φ 254 a p f r f eq 11 was also solved for quantum yield and the quantum yields calculated for the three uridine concentrations for case without reflection and using a l i r r 1 cm results are 0 0185 0 0012 0 0201 0 006 and 0 0208 0 007 mol einstein 1 for the concentrations of 0 012 0 06 and und 0 108 mm respectively those values are similar to the study of jin et al 2006 however interesting to note is the increase of quantum yield with concentration this could possibly be caused by reversal of degradation being more prominent at lower concentrations such reversal was suspected to cause changes of quantum yield at lower irradiances linden and darby 1997 for the determination of the fluence rate at the center and surface of the petri dish the irradiance from eq 11 needs to be transformed to account for the effective volume v e f f a l i r r resulting in eq 12 the factor 1000 is caused by conversion of l to cm³ the newly proposed eq 12 allows direct calculation of fluence rate e 0 u2 and effective path length lirr slope of lhs from eq 7 this can be an enormous advantage in complex reactor designs with unknown surface area and volume as a note for calculating the average fluence rate in a reactor volume e u2 rather than the fluence rate at the center and surface of the petri dish dividing by pf and rf needs to be skipped 12 e 0 u 2 m w c m 2 e 0 u 2 v e f f v s l o p e u ε 254 φ 254 1000 p f r f analogous to roibu et al 2018 the three equations from different uridine concentrations were used to solve the two unknown variables e 0 u2 and l i r r within each case of reflection the effective path length l i r r is assumed to be constant e 0 u2 can be assumed constant for the duration of an experiment or like in our case to encounter small variations the fluence rate e 0 u2 normalized to the radiometer reading was assumed to be constant the irradiated path lengths in eqs 7 8 and 12 were varied over a range of 0 5 to 5 cm with a step size of 0 01 cm the effective path length in the water was identified by minimizing standard deviation of normalized e 0 u2 for the three uridine concentrations the behavior of lhs in eq 7 as well as the standard deviation of normalized e 0 u2 over path length changes during computation is visualized in figure s3 and s4 in the supplementary information for the three reflective cases e 0 u2 and the average effective light path length are shown in fig 3 e0 u2 is also depicted calculated using eq 11 and the found effective path length expressed as l i r r whereas for r0 effective path lengths is around 1 cm path lengths for 50 reflection r05 and 100 reflection r1 are 1 83 and 2 40 cm respectively which implies an increase by roughly a factor of 1 84 for r05 and 2 41 for r1 this high increase can be explained by the diffuse reflection in the case of a beam perpendicular to the bottom of the petri dish that is being specular reflected path length would double in case of diffuse reflection having a broad range of reflection angles the path length can more than double as for instance a light beam at the right side of the petri dish could be reflected by 30 to the left side traveling a longer distance through the solution the estimated irradiance at the center and surface of the petri dish e0 u2 shows similar results for the two reflective scenarios close to the radiometer readings this further supports the validity of the set up eq 11 as q 0 254 represents the photons coming from the lamp to the solution input power the average increase of e 0 u2 between the different reflections is similar as the increase in effective path length factors of 1 84 and 2 57 for r05 and r1 respectively experiments in this study were conducted at relatively low irradiance of approximately 0 1 mw cm ² radiometer readings linden and darby 1997 observed a changed quantum yield of uridine below a fluence rate of 0 4 mw cm ² which might have been caused by longer exposure time under the heat of the uv lamp leading to a reversing of the degradation therefore the experiments with three different concentrations without reflection were repeated with a shorter collimator tube of 30 cm and an irradiance of approximately 0 5 mw cm ² following the same approach as described above an effective path length of 0 98 cm was determined with normalized irradiance e0 u2 and fluence rate e 0 u2 of 1 12 and 1 10 the results are slightly higher which could indicate higher quantum yields of 0 021 0 022 and 0 023 mol einstein 1 for the three concentrations 0 012 0 06 and 0 108 mm even though quantum yields in general seemed to be increased the same trend of higher quantum yield with higher concentration can be seen 3 3 correction of uridine actinometry for different transmittance and reflection the estimated effective path lengths were used for wf correction eq 2 4 to determine the fluence rate at the center and surface of the petri dish in experiments with different transmittance and reflections fig 4 using this correction no significant differences were found for various transmittances within the three cases of reflection p values of one way anova testing were 0 28 for all cases the corrected fluence rates for the reflective cases are slightly higher compared to wf correction with 1 cm and similar to the e 0 u2 from experiments with different uridine concentrations following this approach df correction was not included in eq 3 as its behavior with the diffuse reflections is not known and it was assumed that the df factor is already included in the calculated average path length the df for field reactor applications is not of great importance as the fluence in the water body and not that emitted from the lamp is of interest overall the findings support that the calculated effective path lengths represent the real average path lengths and that e 0 u2 indicates the actual average fluence rate in reflecting uv reactors average fluence rates in biodosimetry experiments were now determined from normalized e 0 u2 values as shown in fig 3 multiplied with the radiometer readings during the biodosimetry and corrected for wf with the use of l i r r pf and rf using the corrected fluence rates the determined lrvs lie within the qc fig 5 a and close to the curve of the standard case linear model of lrv vs fluence determined with ki kio3 for case t100 r0 extrapolated to higher fluences further confirming validity of the fluence rate adjustments the correlation of the slope of lrv over irradiation time kms2 and the average fluence rate estimated using e 0 u2 also confirms the strong similarity of results across different transmittance and reflection scenarios fig 5b while this new method showed promising results for the evaluated settings it still needs to be validated for flow through systems in practice several different ways to conduct the actinometry for flow through systems might be possible but recirculation of the actinometer solution as described by zalazar et al 2005 seems promising in summary a simple setup includes the uv reactor a storage tank with the possibility of sampling a pump and a heat exchanger using this setup stable temperature large recirculation rates sufficient mixing and small conversion per pass should be ensured in addition the volume of the uv reactor should be considerably smaller than the volume of recirculated solution under those conditions irradiation time in eq 7 might be estimated by multiplying the recirculation time with the ratio of uv reactor volume to total volume of actinometer solution the actinometry in recycling mode has been applied by the authors in another study with promising results sperle et al this study in review for a comprehensive validation of the actinometric method it is recommended to validate a cfd and optical model with results of biodosimetry and compare the results of average fluence rate with actinometry for further improvement investigation of the optimal uridine concentrations is important similarly as described by roibu et al 2018 a high absorbance of the light under a specified uridine actinometer concentration could lead to lower influence of the path length on degradation of the actinometer as most of the light has already vanished after a short distance similar to the extreme case of the ki kio3 actinometer this effect might be minimized for instance by ensuring that the highest uridine concentration still shows a transmittance of at least 10 for the average path length to additionally validate the estimated path lengths another experiment with a higher water depth was performed and is shown in the supporting information water depth could be well estimated when using polychromatic irradiation coefficients used in the calculation might need to be weighted by the relative spectral output as described by roibu et al 2018 and the calculations would be more complex due to the variation of the germicidal action of wavelengths additional points to consider are the effects of evaluated temperatures or behavior of the quantum yield at the boarders of uridine absorbance λ 280 nm besides the current study applied a maximum fluence estimated directly with the radiometer h 0 radio of 740 mj cm 2 as aop processes might be conducted in the range of 1000 mj cm 2 roback et al 2021 another run with the 0 012 mm concentration and the long collimator tube was performed after irradiation with 2600 mj cm 2 calculated normalized irradiance e0 u2 and fluence rate e 0 u2 were 1 10 and 1 11 with a path length of 1 cm this indicates that the method should be suitable for aop processes but the slight increase might be caused by a change in quantum yield according to linden and darby 1997 quantum yield should not change at irradiances higher than 0 4 mw cm 2 so probably the values derived with the short collimator tube should be applicable for studies with higher intensities still it is advised to additionally investigate and validate the behavior of quantum yield at different fluences and fluence rates coupled with more extreme temperatures and over varying uridine concentrations 3 4 implications for practice it was shown that the estimated fluence rate e 0 u2 with the estimated path length is a well suited tool to predict the inactivation of ms2 phage for the diffusely reflected uv irradiation in the cba setting for real reactors however the actinometry might indicate the average fluence but as it is not predicting the fluence distribution received by microorganisms it cannot replace biodosimetry for water disinfection nevertheless the proposed actinometry can provide valuable information and has several implications for practice 3 4 1 simple method to characterize alternative lab scale uv reactors standardized cba with parallel light and well defined path length is not accessible for researchers worldwide in addition boundary conditions e g the integration into treatment concepts or the need of larger sample volumes may require the utilization of alternative reactor designs for a full characterization of such reactors labor and time intense biodosimetry is required the new method to determine the effective path length and average fluence rate of the reactor is cost effective does not require handling of toxic chemicals and is fast to implement in addition biodosimetry might be too sensitive for reactor characterization e g when applying high fluences as in uv aops further with knowledge about the effective path length of the light it might be possible to calculate the average fluence rate for different water matrixes and transmittances predicting the inactivation performance for the cba setting worked well but it must be considered that a correction for wf assumes a completely mixed solution bolton and linden 2003 morowitz 1950 which might not always be the case in real reactors in lab scale operation this limitation might be overcome by recycling the water through the reactor to ensure equal exposure to uv light however future experiments are needed to determine required recycling rates and validate the wf correction for the average fluence for flow through reactors and for reflections with longer path lengths 3 4 2 fluence determination for non parallel light sources and reflective reactors it should be emphasized that it was possible to predict the fluence under diffuse reflection and therefore also non parallel light this is extremely helpful for examining the fluence when using light sources such as uv leds where quasi collimation might not be achieved due to patterned light output non parallel light can cause problems for radiometer measurements and any increased path length within a reactor could lead to varied disinfection performance in addition for a given reactor the ratio of fluence rate to irradiance could be used to quantitatively estimate the degree of reflection or gain in efficiency due to reflections and path length increases furthermore when reflections are used in an industrial reactor the proposed method might be able to detect if fouling of reflective parts is occurring 3 4 3 characterization of flow through reactors by combining actinometry with hydraulic reactor and optical field modeling the modeling of complex reactor geometries requires validation sun et al 2022 next to biodosimetry the proposed method could serve as an alternative for model validation being easy and fast to implement without expensive testing facilities both average fluence rate as well as the optical path length could be parameters for model comparison with a validated model the inactivation of microorganisms under different water qualities might be predicted 3 4 4 qualitatively characterize the fluence distribution in full scale reactors together with the results of biodosimetry additional information about the reactor performance and possible strategies to enhance future design can be gained by comparing the fluence estimated with the uridine actinometry using three different uridine concentrations h u2 and the measured inactivation of ms2 at a certain fluence flowrate it is possible to check if the fluence distribution is behaving similarly as in a cba the ratio of ref and average fluence h u2 can be seen as mixing efficiency eq 13 a figure of merit for the quality of fluence distribution further described by bolton and cotton 2022 and usually calculated by modeling the reactor to calculate mixing efficiency a certain fluence ηh a linear model or an interpolation might be used to predict the lrv at a design fluence if lrv kinetics over several fluences was recorded but not at the fluence of interest e g predict the lrv at 40 mj cm 2 by an interpolation of the lrv at 30 and 50 mj cm 2 from this lrv the ref can be calculated using the ms2 inactivation kinetics under standard conditions in a cba for wavelengths other than 254 nm actinometry results might need correction for germicidal efficiency as compared to 254 nm a ηh of 1 indicates equal or better fluence distribution as in a cba likely the best case possible whereas ηh considerably smaller than 1 can indicate hydraulic shortcuts or an unequal fluence distribution occurring in an uv reactor the investigated settings of reflection and transmittance showed an average η40 of 1 02 0 09 at a fluence of 40 mj cm 2 indicating that in all the experiments the fluence is equally distributed to the phage as it is suspected as they were performed in a mixed petri dish overall ηh can be seen as the efficiency to transfer the light energy within the reactor to the microorganisms maximizing ηh is a primary goal of engineers designing uv reactors bolton and cotton 2022 however it should be noted that changing absorbance of the water might also change ηh values in a reactor as part of the streamlines might receive significantly less irradiation 13 η h r e f h u 2 4 conclusion this study assessed the ability of chemical actinometry to account for effects of reflections and water transmittance in a completely mixed batch reactor under a collimated beam apparatus the following main conclusions can be drawn knowledge about the path length of the light is essential for conventional and the optimized actinometry the developed actinometry demonstrated an easy and fast method to not only quantify irradiance and path length but also by the newly proposed eq 12 to accurately calculate average fluence rate in completely mixed batch uvc reactors used for water treatment without needing any prior knowledge of surface area or volume the proposed method to predict the average fluence could be validated by biodosimetry using ms2 phage in a cba setting for different degrees of transmittance and reflection and can be expected to also apply to non parallel light sources such as those emitted by uv leds nevertheless the method needs to be additionally validated in flow through and industry standard reactors the estimated average fluence rate could provide valuable information for all uv reactors for water treatment but could be especially useful where biodosimetry is too sensitive e g uv aop processes to enhance results attributes of uridine should be validated over diverse fluence rate ranges uridine concentrations and more extreme temperatures the optimized actinometry method is not designed to determine fluence distribution in reactors used for water disinfection but could be used for model validation and a first performance estimation using the new actinometric method together with biodosimetry mixing efficiency might be directly calculated without modeling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15168,the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides plays a crucial role in controlling their interfacial reactions for which various surface complexation models have been developed the diversity of mineralogical properties of iron hydr oxides has resulted in a redundancy of model parameters which hampers the modeling of iron hydr oxides in soils and sediments where goethite hematite and ferrihydrite dominate the iron hydr oxide mass fraction to capture their combined surface reactivity optimized generic protonation parameters of the charge distribution multisite complexation cd music extended stern gouy chapman esgc model were derived by reanalyzing literature datasets and tested with some newly synthesized iron hydr oxides it was observed that the proton and monovalent ion affinity constants of the different iron hydr oxides were located in a narrow range for the singly and triply coordinated hydroxyl sites the obtained generic log affinity constants were 8 3 and 11 7 for the protonation reaction and 0 5 for the reaction with the monovalent background ions their combination with fixed site densities of singly triply coordinated hydroxyl sites of 3 45 2 70 5 00 2 50 and 5 80 1 40 sites nm2 for goethite hematite and ferrihydrite respectively provided good results the stern layer capacitances of the inner and outer stern layers were set equal and could be acquired by an empirical correlation with the sample specific surface area ssa the cd music esgc model with the generic model parameters enables good quality predictions of the proton reactivity of iron hydr oxides in 1 1 electrolyte solutions regardless of the sample heterogeneity the advantages of the generic cd music esgc model are twofold 1 protonation of iron hydr oxides can be described without making use of spectroscopic measurements and proton titrations and 2 the model calculations are greatly simplified graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron hydr oxides surface charge surface complexation model generic protonation parameters database data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction naturally occurring iron hydr oxides exist in a variety of chemical compositions mineral structures and crystallinities navrotsky et al 2008 high contents of iron hydr oxides are especially observed in highly weathered soils and sediments in general the mass fractions of well crystalline goethite and hematite and poorly crystalline ferrihydrite dominate natural iron hydr oxide in soils and sediments hochella et al 2008 tartaj et al 2011 natural iron hydr oxides play a vital role in the mobility and bioavailability of nutrients and contaminants in the environment atalay et al 2014 brown 2001 ong et al 2020 the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides is inevitably affected by the diversity and abundance of the hydroxyl surface sites morphology the specific surface area ssa and or particle size and the solution conditions that determine the protonation and deprotonation of the surface sites and surface charge density liu et al 2021 mendez et al 2022 hence the speciation distribution of elements on the surface sites of iron hydr oxides varies considerably depending on the particle types and solution composition one of the challenges is an adequate prediction of the protonation state of the surface sites and subsequently the surface charge density which are required to gain insight into the fate of elements in soils or sediments containing iron hydr oxides the focus of the current paper is therefore on protonation reactions surface complexation models scms have been widely applied to describe and predict the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides wang and giammar 2013 the charge distribution multisite complexation cd music model in combination with an extended stern gouy chapman esgc model for the electrical double layer is the most popular scm for metal hydr oxides bahr et al 2020 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1996 koopal et al 2020 with the esgc model the stern layer is subdivided into an inner and outer stern layer the predictive quality of cd music esgc modeling of the interfacial reactions at the natural iron hydr oxide aqueous electrolyte solution interface is determined by the reliability of the basic model parameters for protonation adams et al 2021 although most applied material specific parameters mimic the interfacial protonation reactions of specific iron hydr oxides and provide a good description of the charge density curves the diversity of mineralogical composition of natural iron hydr oxides results in a redundancy of model parameters which complicates the application of a detailed cd music esgc model to natural environments bompoti et al 2019 detailed insight into the morphology to identify the surface sites and their densities and the availability of high quality charge density ph data derived from acid base titrations are indispensable prerequisite to establish the point of zero charge pzc and to optimize the stern layer capacitances by fitting the model to the data consequently detailed application of the model is mainly constrained to laboratory synthesized well characterized iron hydr oxides provided that there is an off the shelf set of generic model parameters to describe the surface reactivity of natural iron hydr oxides in soils and sediments a laborious detailed characterization can be omitted some studies have derived generic model parameters for specific iron hydr oxides based on the unique site composition and spatial distribution bompoti et al 2017 han and katz 2019 michael et al 2018 to derive generic model parameters and to minimize their number parameter correlation and fixation has been used as mathematical methods for goethite goe generic model parameters were established and correlations were observed between some model parameters and the ssa han and katz 2019 mangold et al 2014 for ferrihydrite fh both the proton affinities logk h and site densities n s were fixed as a constant bompoti et al 2017 the derivation of generic model parameters for hematite hem has been thwarted by variable morphologies huang et al 2018 yan et al 2022 to further simplify the situation the question arises based on similarities of the iron hydr oxides at microscopic level is it possible to derive a single generic set of optimized cd music esgc parameters that is capable of capturing the protonation reactions of goe hem and fh the protonation of these iron hydr oxides can then be predicted without detailed characterization especially the acid base titration moreover protonation of natural iron hydr oxide can then be approximated using the generic model when the fractions of goe hem and fh are known according to schwertmann and cornel 2008 goe consists of double bands of edge sharing feo3 oh 3 octahedra while hem consists of layers of feo6 octahedra that are connected by edge and face sharing and stacked perpendicular to the c axis the ideal structure for fh comprises 80 hexa coordinated fe fe1 and fe2 and 20 tetra coordinated fe fe3 michel et al 2010 despite the diverse crystallographic properties among these hydr oxides octahedron fe can be identified as a similar structural unit schwertmann and cornell 2008 shi et al 2021 song et al 2015 this implies that 1 similar fe o distances dominate the surface reactivity of the different iron hydr oxides and 2 the protonation of singly and triply coordinated surface sites is dominant for surface charge development according to the bond valence approach of brown 1978 and the calculation formula of intrinsic logk h hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1996 hiemstra et al 1996 this points to a similarity of the median proton affinity constants of goe hem and fh the doubly coordinated fe sites may be considered nonreactive and the site densities will depend on the type of hydr oxide therefore a set of generic protonation parameters may theoretically exist to describe the surface reactivity of goe hem and fh however it is still a challenge to develop a set of generic parameters of the cd music esgc model for protonation of different iron hydr oxides with a limited number of parameters see table s7 which indicates the surface reactions and parameters the derivation of a set of generic parameters of the cd music esgc model for goe hem and fh is in practice a delicate balance between the accuracy and practical operability for describing natural iron hydr oxides a set of generic model parameters should not only mitigate the computational intensity of the model but also conveniently guarantee a good prediction quality of the protonation reactions and charge density ph of naturally present iron hydr oxides without needing laborious spectroscopic and protonation measurements such a set of generic parameters would greatly enhance the application of the cd music esgc model to iron hydr oxides in soils and sediments therefore the main objective of this study is to expand the application boundaries of the cd music esgc model to natural ion hydr oxides by providing a set of generic model parameters that allow the description of the proton charge vs ph when the nature and the specific surface area of the sample are known goe hem or estimated fh this is achieved in two steps i investigating the predictive quality of modeling the charge density curves of various goe hem and fh samples with an optimized set of cd music proton binding parameters for goe hem and fh and ii investigating a simple way to obtain the esgc stern layer capacitances 2 materials and methods 2 1 surface charge density database charge density data of iron hydr oxides were sourced from the isi web of knowledge database as of june 2021 with specific search terms goethite or hematite or ferrihydrite and surface charge or proton binding or acid base titration this resulted in 1253 studies of goethite goe 1925 of hematite hem and 399 of ferrihydrite fh these studies were then carefully reviewed to meet two inclusion criteria 1 iron hydr oxides were of pure phase and 2 co2 free conditions were explicitly mentioned this methodology extracted 63 studies containing charge density data of goe 38 samples hem 18 samples and fh 17 samples as some studies contained information on different samples the selected studies covered a wide range of ssa values i e 23 105 m2 g for goe 6 60 m2 g for hem and 229 710 m2 g for fh and for each hydr oxide a range of sorbent concentration ph and type and concentration of background electrolyte were covered since the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides can be strongly affected by particle size boily et al 2001 crystal morphology huang et al 2018 and aging time mendez and hiemstra 2020b related information for all samples was also recorded detailed information on each iron hydr oxide can be found in the supplementary information si table s1 s3 and s10 the experimental surface charge densities of the samples were obtained by scanning the published results and the data points were obtained by image analysis first a sensitivity analysis of the adjustable parameters of the cd music esgc model was carried out with a set of optimal parameters derived from a goe sample antelo et al 2005 a hem sample venema et al 1998 and a fh sample fukushi et al 2013 subsequently to derive the generic model parameters 35 goe samples 16 hem samples and 16 fh samples indicated in fig s1 s3 were used the 6 remaining samples 3 goe liang et al 2021c venema et

employment of two sources of datasets increased the diversity of data sources and avoided anthropogenic influences the verification experiments were further carried out with 6 samples prepared in the lab goe with low medium and high ssa denoted as goe 23new goe 65new and goe 85 xiong et al 2018 respectively hem with nanoplate hem 30 1 and nanocube hem 22 2 morphology liang et al 2021b and freshly

varies among different iron hydr oxides mendez and hiemstra 2020a therefore its value should be regarded as adjustable the reactive sites feoh 0 5 and fe3o 0 5 were used as reference states for each oxide and the charges due to proton binding were conventionally placed at the 0 plane that of the monovalent background electrolyte ions at the 1 plane and the 2 plane is the start of the diffuse

lyklema 1968 due to irreversible aggregation of the fh nanoparticles by the drying and outgassing process required for n2 adsorption bet ssafh is generally underestimated strehlau et al 2017 a theoretically derived ssafh is 600 m2 g davis et al 1978 a reliable ssafh can be experimentally obtained by employing the probe ion method using either phosphate ions hiemstra et al 2010 mendez et al

et al 2013 the ssa of the fh samples was considered a parameter to be optimized by fitting the model to the adsorption data with this optimization a novel approach was used in which ssafh and c st fh were simultaneously fitted by iterative cd music esgc calculations using a consistent set of molar mass m nano mass density ρ nano and surface curvature of the fh particles mendez and hiemstra 2020b the site densities of feoh n sfeoh and fe3o n sfe3o for goe and hem were derived by the weighted sum of the site densities of each crystal facet and the corresponding cfcs the site density n sfeoh fh was determined by the surface depletion sd model and the value of n sfe3o fh was determined by fitting the charge density curves to the model hiemstra 2013 preliminary proton affinity constants of feoh logk h feoh and fe3o logk h fe3o for goe hem and fh were determined by the bond valence approach and optimized by fitting the model to the charge density curves the ion pair affinity constants logk ip a c of the monovalent background anions a and cations c were set equal and given a fixed value in the implementation of scms simultaneously fitting many model parameters may result in multiple combinations of optimal parameters that provide a reasonably good description of specific data bompoti et al 2018 lenoir et al 2010 this problem can be avoided by fixing relatively insensitive parameters so that a remaining limited number of parameters can be adjusted by regression analysis in the present study this procedure was followed fitting of the model to the various data for each hydr oxide resulted in optimized parameter values n sfeoh and n sfe3o were separately calculated logk h fe3o and logk ip were regarded as relatively insensitive parameters with fixed optimal values and logk h feoh c st and for fh ssafh were optimized by fitting the model to the data the detailed considerations are provided in the results section the values for each sample and the detailed iterative cd music esgc modeling for fh to obtain c st and ssafh are presented in the si to systematically evaluate and quantify the effect of parameter variation on the surface charge density a sensitivity analysis of the adjustable parameters was then carried out using a sample of goe antelo et al 2005 hem venema et al 1998 and fh fukushi et al 2013 the sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the targeted parameter in a reasonable range and fixing other parameters at their optimal values the sensitivity of the parameters was identified by the deviations of the calculated charge density curves from the data points at different parameter values as a complement the effect of variable parameter values on the targeted parameters was also evaluated with the sample of goe antelo et al 2005 in the sensitivity analysis si four scenarios of constant values were considered for each variable parameter and then the sensitivity could be inferred from the change of the target parameter values 2 3 generic model parameters according to the above analysis only two parameters c st and logk h feoh must be optimized with goe and hem and three parameters ssafh c st and logk h feoh must be optimized with fh these model parameters were derived by using the cd music esgc model to fit the charge density data of each oxide sample as indicated above an iterative method was used to obtain c st fh and ssafh a combination of the computer program ecosat keizer and van riemsdijk 1998 and external software fit kinniburgh and tang 1993 were used for fitting the cd music esgc model to the 35 goe 16 hem and 16 fh samples some studies have testified that the ssa had a linear correlation with the parameters bompoti et al 2018 han and katz 2019 villalobos et al 2009 the correlation potentially reflects the variation in the crystal face contributions cfcs of goethite the different dominant crystal facets of hematite and the particle size of fh following these studies the optimized parameters logk h feoh and c st were further investigated for a correlation with the measured ssa goe hem or optimized ssa fh of the samples the corresponding relationships to crystal structure particle morphology diversity and abundance of hydroxyl surface sites were comprehensively compared and analyzed to simplify the acquisition of the remaining variable parameters 2 4 parameter verification the set of generic parameters of the cd music esgc model should essentially reflect the variation in protonation reactions of the three types of iron hydr oxides and the model should accurately predict their charge density vs ph over a wide range of ionic strength values therefore to verify the applicability of the generic model parameters the charge density data of 12 samples that have not been used for the derivation of the generic model parameters see materials section and table s10 were calculated using the generic cd music esgc model and the results were compared with the measured charge densities 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis results of the effect of variable parameters on the surface charge density of goe are shown in fig 1 while those of hem and fh are depicted in fig s1 a detailed sensitivity analysis of the effect of variable parameters on the target parameters can also be found in the si 3 1 1 proton affinity constants a simple approach used for predicting the surface charge of iron hydr oxides has been to fix both logk h feoh and logk h fe3o to the pzc hiemstra et al 1996 in the present study this route has not been followed since i an indispensable prerequisite is that the pzc must be required from laborious titration data for each iron hydr oxide and ii based on the bond valence approach the two affinities differ most literature values of logk h feoh and logk h fe3o varied from 7 5 to 9 0 and from 10 5 to 12 0 respectively boily 2012 liang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 therefore for the sensitivity analysis of logk h the surface charge curves at the given conditions were calculated with logk h feoh varying from 7 5 to 9 0 fig 1a f and fig s1a f g l or logk h fe3o varying from 10 5 to 12 0 fig 1b f and fig s1b f h l similar changes in the surface charge of goe hem and fh resulted implying a comparable effect of logk h feoh or logk h fe3o in modeling the charge density of the three iron hydr oxides the calculated charge curves with logk h feoh 7 5 showed a lower pzc almost 2 units and a lower charge density than the curves calculated with logk h feoh 9 0 fig 1a and fig s1a g however the calculated charge curves with logk h fe3o at 10 5 and 12 0 almost overlapped with each other indicating that the surface charge curves were relatively insensitive to logk h fe3o fig 1b and fig s1b h the different contribution of these two surface groups to the charge development has also been found in the study of hiemstra et al 1996 attributed to two distinct logk h values for two reactive groups since logk h feoh could strongly affect the charging behavior of iron hydr oxides it was recognized as an adjustable parameter of the model the logk h fe3o was regarded as an insensitive parameter and set equal to the theoretical value of 11 7 calculated for goethite hiemstra et al 1996 evaluation of the effect of variable parameters on target parameters also led to the conclusion that the parameter logk h feoh was sensitive and logk h fe3o and logk ip were relatively insensitive see si 3 1 2 stern layer capacitances the sensitivity analysis of c st was performed within the literature range of 0 60 to 1 45 f m2 bompoti et al 2019 as shown in fig 1c f and fig s1c f i l there was a similar variation in the surface charge curves of goe hem and fh fig 1a and fig s1a g a higher c st resulted in better screening and a higher charge density while the pzc was not affected the variation in charge density was more pronounced at lower ph which demonstrated that the c st effect was ph dependent fig 1c and fig s1c i overall c st has a significant influence on the prediction of surface charge and should be set as an adjustable parameter in parameter optimization evaluation of the effect of variable parameters on target parameters also led to the conclusion that c st was a sensitive parameter see si 3 1 3 specific surface areas ssa to transform the specific charge densities c g into surface densities c m2 ssa was needed therefore the calculated charge densities were linearly affected by the ssa for goe and hem measured n2 bet ssas were used but the ssa of fh is less well known a value of ssafh 650 m2 g was used as the regular value and the literature range of 450 to 750 m2 g chen et al 2020 hiemstra 2018 wang et al 2013 was investigated in the sensitivity analysis the ssafh of 650 m2 g transformed the specific charge densities c g at relatively low surface densities c m2 fig s1 l as the charge density curves c m2 are linearly correlated with ssa this parameter should be optimized for fh unless the phosphate method hiemstra and zhao 2016 hiemstra et al 2010 is used to determine ssafh 3 1 4 site densities typically goe nanoparticles exhibit a needle shaped morphology that elongates along the crystallographic c axis they are terminated by 110 or 100 facets on the elongated facets and capped by 021 or 001 facets at the ends liang et al 2021c prélot et al 2003 the most reported fraction of 110 or 100 facets in goe varied from 90 to 70 while that of 021 or 100 facets changed from 10 to 30 livi et al 2017 salazar camacho and villalobos 2010 in this case the n sfeoh and n sfe3o of goe were in the range of 3 45 to 4 35 sites nm2 and 2 70 to 2 10 sites nm2 respectively the sensitivity analysis of n sfeoh and n sfe3o was conducted by testing two cfc combinations 90 10 and 30 70 resulting in total site densities n s goe 6 15 3 45 2 70 sites nm2 and 6 45 4 35 2 10 sites nm2 as shown in fig 1d and 1f the charge density did not change substantially by varying n s goe this result implied that n s goe n sfeoh n sfe3o was an insensitive parameter which agreed well with the results reported in previous studies sverjensky 2003 xu et al 2019 the generic values of n sfeoh and n sfe3o used with the parameter optimization were 3 45 and 2 70 site nm2 cfc90 10 for goe respectively in the present study several hem nanocrystals with known cfcs were employed and the calculated n sfeoh and n sfe3o ranged from 2 20 to 7 30 sites nm2 and 1 10 to 4 00 sites nm2 respectively the sensitivity analysis of n sfeoh and n sfe3o of hem indicated that the predicted charge curves were somewhat affected by the selected values fig s1d and f however their influence was much less significant than the effect of a variation in logk h or c st in the literature christl and kretzschmar 1999 hwang and lenhart 2008 it has been testified that for hem nanoparticles with different ssas the optimized c st values varied significantly at low ns hem 5 00 site nm2 while they were hardly affected at the high ns hem 5 00 site nm2 this result indicated that only low ns hem and c st have complementary effects in the modeling of surface charge curves in hem studies christl and kretzschmar 1999 venema et al 1998 with a total site density of approximately 7 5 sites nm2 the model could give a reasonable description for the experimental charging curves following venema et al 1998 n sfeoh 5 00 sites nm2 and n sfe3o 2 50 sites nm2 were selected as the generic site densities of hem the polyhedral composition of the fh structure was found to be particle size dependent but the average value of n sfeoh was invariant to size and obtained by the surface depletion sd model as 5 80 0 30 sites nm2 hiemstra 2013 furthermore by using n sfeoh 5 80 sites nm2 the average n sfe3o fh value acquired from fitting the charge density curves was 1 40 0 50 site nm2 these values correspond well with previous studies hiemstra 2018 mendez and hiemstra 2020c the relatively low value can be attributed to the mutual charge compensation of the sites with different types of coordinated o atoms hiemstra and zhao 2016 therefore n sfeoh fh 5 80 site nm2 and n sfe3o fh 1 40 site nm2 were adopted as generic values 3 1 5 ion pair affinity constant the literature range of logk ip of common monovalent background ions is from 1 00 to 0 36 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2006 mendez and hiemstra 2020b compared to the effect of varying logk h feoh and c st values the slight deviation from the 1 1 line of logk ip demonstrated its relative insensitivity to the prediction of the charge density of goe hem and fh fig 1e f and fig s1e f k l similar observations were reported in previous work rahnemaie et al 2006 rietra et al 2000 additional model calculations were also conducted with the six iron hydr oxide samples to analyze the effect of asymmetric logk ip values in modeling the surface charge densities si the results indicated only a very weak influence of asymmetric logk ip on the charge densities table s6 therefore logk ip was fixed as a generic constant and the commonly used value of 0 50 for most 1 1 background electrolytes was employed for both cations and anions 3 2 optimal parameters and correlations with the specific surface areas 3 2 1 optimized parameters the model parameter settings of the cd music esgc model are summarized in table s7 each sample in the surface charge database was separately modeled to obtain the adjustable parameters logk h feoh and c st for goe and hem and ssa logk h feoh and c st for fh by fitting the model to the data a comparison of the calculated and experimental results can be found in figs s3 s5 and the optimized parameters have been collected in table s8 in the subsequent sections the correlations between logk h feoh or c st and ssa are investigated 3 2 2 logkh feoh and ssa according to the result of a p value test in the correlation analysis there was no linear relationship between the ssa and logk h feoh therefore the values of logk h feoh were considered to be independent of the ssa the distribution of optimal logk h feoh values for different types of iron hydr oxides is depicted in fig 2 a the values of logk h feoh vary from 7 8 to 8 8 among different iron hydr oxide samples this result corresponds well with the range of logk h feoh for different types of iron hydr oxides reported in the literature in fact compared to the logk h of other metal oxides such as logk h aloh 9 87 for gibbsite park 2018 and logk h mnoⅰ 16 0 16 5 logk h mn2oⅱ ⅲ 0 3 1 4 logk h mn2mnioⅳ 2 5 3 4 and logk h mn3mnⅴ 9 8 11 4 for birnessite zhao et al 2018 the range of logk h feoh was sufficiently narrow to reflect the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides the descriptive statistics suggested a mean value of logk h feoh of 8 30 0 30 standard deviation for the three types of iron hydr oxides based on the bond valence approach logk h of a specific site is predominated by the type and number of coordinating ions of o atoms rather than the structural differences among the iron hydr oxides boily 2012 bompoti et al 2019 specifically the value of logk h feoh was linked to the distance between the o atom and coordinating fe atoms hiemstra et al 1996 due to the similar octahedron fe presented at the surface of different iron hydr oxides and the similar fe o distance 1 94 2 10 å in the octahedron fe it was reasonable that different types of iron hydr oxides have an approximate logk h feoh villalobos et al 2009 although the range of logk h feoh of fh was slightly larger than that of goe and hem the median value was similar to that of goe and hem according to michel et al 2007 2010 logk h feoh of fh is somewhat affected by the structural relaxation in lattice dimensions of fh nanoparticles which may result in somewhat lower values than that of goe or hem the relatively small differences in octahedron fe arrangements among the iron hydr oxides imply some difference in the location of surface groups in the octahedral crystal chain and local microenvironment schwertmann and cornel 2008 accordingly logk h feoh was only slightly affected by the microstructure of the surface sites of the iron hydr oxides but located in a relatively narrow range 3 2 3 cst and ssa the correlation between c st and ssa is depicted in figs 2b to 2d for goe hem and fh respectively the ssa of goe and hem was negatively correlated with the c st while that of fh was positively correlated with the c st the linear correlations between c st and ssa were c st 0 0058 ssa 1 52 n 35 for goe c st 0 038 ssa 2 39 n 16 for hem and c st 0 00027 ssa 0 976 n 16 for fh thus a lower ssa of goe or hem corresponded to a higher c st value the ssa depends on the crystal structure which in turn affects the site density n s as n s is fixed in the model actual variations in n s will be at least partly accounted for by variations in c st goe crystals generally showed a high ratio of length to width fig s7 and a decreasing ssa with increasing length table s1 simultaneously the cfcs of the 001 facet notably increased due to the replacement of the original 110 facet by the step like growth of alternating 110 and 001 facets salazar camacho and villalobos 2010 weidler et al 1996 this resulted in higher site densities for goe with increasing length decreasing ssa charging is promoted by both high n s and high c st as n s is fixed an increase in c st is needed according to lützenkirchen et al 2008 and sverjensky 2005 a high surface potential leads to a strong attraction of the counterions which leads to a small distance between counterions on the goethite surface and a high c st however this would make the c st potential and charge dependent and increase the specific counterion adsorption with increasing electrostatic attraction which also enhances proton dissociation which is included in the model hem nanocubes and nanospheres were commonly enclosed by the 012 facet while hem nanoplates and rhombohedrons were dominated by the 001 facet huang et al 2018 more importantly the 001 facets of hem only contain the doubly coordinated fe2oh sites which were considered nonactive in contrast with the 012 facet with abundant feoh and fe3o sites lv et al 2018 in addition the feoh and fe3o sites were arranged in a series of ridges and valleys on the surface of the 012 facets which was observably different from the flat arrangement of surface sites on the 001 and 110 facets catalano et al 2007 thus it can be inferred that the variation in c st of hem particles was related to their cfcs according to previous studies huang et al 2016 lv et al 2018 hematite nanoparticles dominated by 012 facets generally exhibited a lower ssa value than those dominated by 001 facets this difference is likely the main reason for the correlation between c st and ssa in addition to the difference in site composition on individual hem facets the spatial configuration of surface o atoms and the surface rugosity may affect the c st of hem nanoparticles as indicated in refs hwang and lenhart 2008 schudel et al 1997 for hematite nanocrystals with the same morphology an increased surface roughness and particle porosity larger ssa resulted in decreased c st hiemstra et al 2013 indicated that idealized fh particles developed a nearly spherical or hexagonal morphology constructed by the 110 and 021 like facets with 001 like terminations the mineral and surface structure of fh was found to be particle size dependent hiemstra and zhao 2016 according to ssafh 6 ρ nano d where ρ nano is the mass density and d is the spherical particle diameter a decrease in particle size d corresponds with an increased ssafh according to the capacitance equation of a spherical condenser c st c st flat d δd d hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2009 where δd is the thickness of the total stern layer and c st flat is the capacitance of a flat surface hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2006 c st will increase with decreasing particle size since ρ nano and δd are approximately constant it follows that c st will tend to increase with increasing ssafh the approximately spherical shape of fh causes a trend that is opposite to that of goe and hem 3 3 generic model parameters the generic model parameters derived after the evaluation of sensitivity analysis and the parameter optimization are summarized in table 1 together with the correlations the insensitive parameters logk h fe3o n s goe n sfeoh n sfe3o goe n s hem n sfeoh n sfe3o hem and logk ip a logk ip c were set as constant values of 11 7 3 45 2 70 5 00 2 50 and 0 5 respectively the median logk h feoh of goe hem and fh was 8 3 0 3 and the recommended values for goe hem and fh were 8 3 8 6 and 8 0 respectively the ssas of goe and hem should be measured by the n2 bet method brunauer et al 1938 van den hul and lyklema 1968 while that of fh should be measured by the phosphate method hiemstra et al 2010 mendez et al 2020 rather than using the standard value of davis et al 1978 with known ssa c st can be calculated using the iron hydr oxide specific correlation between c st and ssa the generic proton constants indicated the similarity in intrinsic surface properties i e similar octahedral fe presented at the surface of different iron hydr oxides the differences in site density can be attributed to the differences in the octahedral fe arrangements schwertmann and cornell 2008 and cfcs lützenkirchen et al 2008 differences in the stern layer capacitance are due to actual differences in site density surface roughness schudel et al 1997 composition and spatial distribution of the surface sites lv et al 2018 and particle shape hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2009 the set of generic model parameters can greatly mitigate the computational intensity and describe the surface reactivity of goe hem and fh 3 4 parameter verification to verify the quality of the generic parameters the parameters were substituted into the cd music esgc model to predict the charge density curves of a series of 12 samples specified in table s10 6 goe 4 hem and 2 fh at different ionic strengths the comparison of the predicted and experimental charge densities is displayed in fig 3 the correlation between the predicted charge density y and experimental charge density x could be fitted by a linear equation y 0 96x 0 005 i e the slope was close to 1 the intercept was approximately 0 and most data points fell into the 95 prediction interval this indicated that the cd music esgc model with generic parameters provided a satisfactory prediction of the charge density behavior of the three iron hydr oxides further information can be found in fig s8 where the experimental and predicted charge density curves are depicted these results indicate that the deviation of the model primarily occurred at low ph where the experimental error of surface charge determination with acid base titration was relatively high the charge density c m2 of goe fig s8a f and hem fig s8g j decreased with increasing ssa whereas that of fh fig s8k and l only slightly increased this corresponds with the observed correlations between c st and the ssa similar trends have also been indicated in the literature bompoti et al 2017 villalobos and antelo 2011 due to the fixed logk h logk ip and n s values for goe hem and fh differences in structure and or shape that led to differences in ssa also led to differences in c st 4 conclusions the present study provides a set of generic parameters for the cd music esgc model which allows prediction of the surface charge density of iron hydr oxides once their ssa is known this result is a good balance between simplification of the model calculation and an adequate prediction of the proton activity of iron hydr oxides the generic parameters have been obtained by a comprehensive reanalysis of literature datasets of goe hem and fh by the cd music esgc model with fixed site densities for each iron hydr oxide similar proton and monovalent ion pair affinity constants were established for the different iron hydr oxides for a good correspondence with experimental results an adjustable stern layer capacitance was needed the obtained capacitances showed a simple linear correlation with the ssa therefore it can simply be obtained when the ssa of the iron hydr oxide is known the applicability of the generic parameters has been verified by comparing the model results with the charge density data of 12 additional samples the generic parameters encapsulate the variation in surface sites face distributions and the similarities in the basic structural unit of various iron hydr oxides and greatly relaxed the connection between the model parameters and the diverse mineralogical properties compared to the material specific parameters of the traditional cd music model the significance of generic parameters in this study is that complicated characterization and acid base titration were unnecessary for the prediction of surface reactivity table s11 the cd music esgc model using the generic parameters for iron hydr oxides can also be a valuable tool in modeling iron hydr oxides in natural systems especially when a detailed characterization of the samples is absent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15168,the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides plays a crucial role in controlling their interfacial reactions for which various surface complexation models have been developed the diversity of mineralogical properties of iron hydr oxides has resulted in a redundancy of model parameters which hampers the modeling of iron hydr oxides in soils and sediments where goethite hematite and ferrihydrite dominate the iron hydr oxide mass fraction to capture their combined surface reactivity optimized generic protonation parameters of the charge distribution multisite complexation cd music extended stern gouy chapman esgc model were derived by reanalyzing literature datasets and tested with some newly synthesized iron hydr oxides it was observed that the proton and monovalent ion affinity constants of the different iron hydr oxides were located in a narrow range for the singly and triply coordinated hydroxyl sites the obtained generic log affinity constants were 8 3 and 11 7 for the protonation reaction and 0 5 for the reaction with the monovalent background ions their combination with fixed site densities of singly triply coordinated hydroxyl sites of 3 45 2 70 5 00 2 50 and 5 80 1 40 sites nm2 for goethite hematite and ferrihydrite respectively provided good results the stern layer capacitances of the inner and outer stern layers were set equal and could be acquired by an empirical correlation with the sample specific surface area ssa the cd music esgc model with the generic model parameters enables good quality predictions of the proton reactivity of iron hydr oxides in 1 1 electrolyte solutions regardless of the sample heterogeneity the advantages of the generic cd music esgc model are twofold 1 protonation of iron hydr oxides can be described without making use of spectroscopic measurements and proton titrations and 2 the model calculations are greatly simplified graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron hydr oxides surface charge surface complexation model generic protonation parameters database data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction naturally occurring iron hydr oxides exist in a variety of chemical compositions mineral structures and crystallinities navrotsky et al 2008 high contents of iron hydr oxides are especially observed in highly weathered soils and sediments in general the mass fractions of well crystalline goethite and hematite and poorly crystalline ferrihydrite dominate natural iron hydr oxide in soils and sediments hochella et al 2008 tartaj et al 2011 natural iron hydr oxides play a vital role in the mobility and bioavailability of nutrients and contaminants in the environment atalay et al 2014 brown 2001 ong et al 2020 the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides is inevitably affected by the diversity and abundance of the hydroxyl surface sites morphology the specific surface area ssa and or particle size and the solution conditions that determine the protonation and deprotonation of the surface sites and surface charge density liu et al 2021 mendez et al 2022 hence the speciation distribution of elements on the surface sites of iron hydr oxides varies considerably depending on the particle types and solution composition one of the challenges is an adequate prediction of the protonation state of the surface sites and subsequently the surface charge density which are required to gain insight into the fate of elements in soils or sediments containing iron hydr oxides the focus of the current paper is therefore on protonation reactions surface complexation models scms have been widely applied to describe and predict the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides wang and giammar 2013 the charge distribution multisite complexation cd music model in combination with an extended stern gouy chapman esgc model for the electrical double layer is the most popular scm for metal hydr oxides bahr et al 2020 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1996 koopal et al 2020 with the esgc model the stern layer is subdivided into an inner and outer stern layer the predictive quality of cd music esgc modeling of the interfacial reactions at the natural iron hydr oxide aqueous electrolyte solution interface is determined by the reliability of the basic model parameters for protonation adams et al 2021 although most applied material specific parameters mimic the interfacial protonation reactions of specific iron hydr oxides and provide a good description of the charge density curves the diversity of mineralogical composition of natural iron hydr oxides results in a redundancy of model parameters which complicates the application of a detailed cd music esgc model to natural environments bompoti et al 2019 detailed insight into the morphology to identify the surface sites and their densities and the availability of high quality charge density ph data derived from acid base titrations are indispensable prerequisite to establish the point of zero charge pzc and to optimize the stern layer capacitances by fitting the model to the data consequently detailed application of the model is mainly constrained to laboratory synthesized well characterized iron hydr oxides provided that there is an off the shelf set of generic model parameters to describe the surface reactivity of natural iron hydr oxides in soils and sediments a laborious detailed characterization can be omitted some studies have derived generic model parameters for specific iron hydr oxides based on the unique site composition and spatial distribution bompoti et al 2017 han and katz 2019 michael et al 2018 to derive generic model parameters and to minimize their number parameter correlation and fixation has been used as mathematical methods for goethite goe generic model parameters were established and correlations were observed between some model parameters and the ssa han and katz 2019 mangold et al 2014 for ferrihydrite fh both the proton affinities logk h and site densities n s were fixed as a constant bompoti et al 2017 the derivation of generic model parameters for hematite hem has been thwarted by variable morphologies huang et al 2018 yan et al 2022 to further simplify the situation the question arises based on similarities of the iron hydr oxides at microscopic level is it possible to derive a single generic set of optimized cd music esgc parameters that is capable of capturing the protonation reactions of goe hem and fh the protonation of these iron hydr oxides can then be predicted without detailed characterization especially the acid base titration moreover protonation of natural iron hydr oxide can then be approximated using the generic model when the fractions of goe hem and fh are known according to schwertmann and cornel 2008 goe consists of double bands of edge sharing feo3 oh 3 octahedra while hem consists of layers of feo6 octahedra that are connected by edge and face sharing and stacked perpendicular to the c axis the ideal structure for fh comprises 80 hexa coordinated fe fe1 and fe2 and 20 tetra coordinated fe fe3 michel et al 2010 despite the diverse crystallographic properties among these hydr oxides octahedron fe can be identified as a similar structural unit schwertmann and cornell 2008 shi et al 2021 song et al 2015 this implies that 1 similar fe o distances dominate the surface reactivity of the different iron hydr oxides and 2 the protonation of singly and triply coordinated surface sites is dominant for surface charge development according to the bond valence approach of brown 1978 and the calculation formula of intrinsic logk h hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1996 hiemstra et al 1996 this points to a similarity of the median proton affinity constants of goe hem and fh the doubly coordinated fe sites may be considered nonreactive and the site densities will depend on the type of hydr oxide therefore a set of generic protonation parameters may theoretically exist to describe the surface reactivity of goe hem and fh however it is still a challenge to develop a set of generic parameters of the cd music esgc model for protonation of different iron hydr oxides with a limited number of parameters see table s7 which indicates the surface reactions and parameters the derivation of a set of generic parameters of the cd music esgc model for goe hem and fh is in practice a delicate balance between the accuracy and practical operability for describing natural iron hydr oxides a set of generic model parameters should not only mitigate the computational intensity of the model but also conveniently guarantee a good prediction quality of the protonation reactions and charge density ph of naturally present iron hydr oxides without needing laborious spectroscopic and protonation measurements such a set of generic parameters would greatly enhance the application of the cd music esgc model to iron hydr oxides in soils and sediments therefore the main objective of this study is to expand the application boundaries of the cd music esgc model to natural ion hydr oxides by providing a set of generic model parameters that allow the description of the proton charge vs ph when the nature and the specific surface area of the sample are known goe hem or estimated fh this is achieved in two steps i investigating the predictive quality of modeling the charge density curves of various goe hem and fh samples with an optimized set of cd music proton binding parameters for goe hem and fh and ii investigating a simple way to obtain the esgc stern layer capacitances 2 materials and methods 2 1 surface charge density database charge density data of iron hydr oxides were sourced from the isi web of knowledge database as of june 2021 with specific search terms goethite or hematite or ferrihydrite and surface charge or proton binding or acid base titration this resulted in 1253 studies of goethite goe 1925 of hematite hem and 399 of ferrihydrite fh these studies were then carefully reviewed to meet two inclusion criteria 1 iron hydr oxides were of pure phase and 2 co2 free conditions were explicitly mentioned this methodology extracted 63 studies containing charge density data of goe 38 samples hem 18 samples and fh 17 samples as some studies contained information on different samples the selected studies covered a wide range of ssa values i e 23 105 m2 g for goe 6 60 m2 g for hem and 229 710 m2 g for fh and for each hydr oxide a range of sorbent concentration ph and type and concentration of background electrolyte were covered since the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides can be strongly affected by particle size boily et al 2001 crystal morphology huang et al 2018 and aging time mendez and hiemstra 2020b related information for all samples was also recorded detailed information on each iron hydr oxide can be found in the supplementary information si table s1 s3 and s10 the experimental surface charge densities of the samples were obtained by scanning the published results and the data points were obtained by image analysis first a sensitivity analysis of the adjustable parameters of the cd music esgc model was carried out with a set of optimal parameters derived from a goe sample antelo et al 2005 a hem sample venema et al 1998 and a fh sample fukushi et al 2013 subsequently to derive the generic model parameters 35 goe samples 16 hem samples and 16 fh samples indicated in fig s1 s3 were used the 6 remaining samples 3 goe liang et al 2021c venema et al 1996 zhong et al 2007 2 hem liang 1988 schudel et al 1997 1 fh chen et al 2020 in fig s10 were used for parameter verification the latter samples were randomly selected from the three subsets the employment of two sources of datasets increased the diversity of data sources and avoided anthropogenic influences the verification experiments were further carried out with 6 samples prepared in the lab goe with low medium and high ssa denoted as goe 23new goe 65new and goe 85 xiong et al 2018 respectively hem with nanoplate hem 30 1 and nanocube hem 22 2 morphology liang et al 2021b and freshly synthesized fh fh 275new the brunauer emmett teller bet ssas of these goe and hem samples were derived from n2 adsorption isotherms at 77 k quantachrome autosorb 1 usa the ssa of fh 275 was calculated from phosphate adsorption data using the transfer functions mendez et al 2020b all characterization results including ssa xrd sem and potentiometric titrations can be found in the si 2 2 parameter determination and sensitivity analysis the parameters that apply to the cd music esgc model for the proton binding to each iron hydr oxide consist of specific surface area ssa cfc crystal face contribution site densities n s proton affinity constants logk h ion pair affinity constants logk ip charge distribution coefficients and stern layer capacitances the inner c 1 and outer c 2 stern layer capacitances were set equal c 1 c 2 c st hiemstra et al 2007 rahnemaie et al 2007 table s7 provides an example of the parameters that are needed the value of c st is known as a parameter that varies among different iron hydr oxides mendez and hiemstra 2020a therefore its value should be regarded as adjustable the reactive sites feoh 0 5 and fe3o 0 5 were used as reference states for each oxide and the charges due to proton binding were conventionally placed at the 0 plane that of the monovalent background electrolyte ions at the 1 plane and the 2 plane is the start of the diffuse layer hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2006 the ssas of goe ssagoe and hem ssahem are considered to be known by n2 gas adsorption measurements using the bet method brunauer et al 1938 van den hul and lyklema 1968 due to irreversible aggregation of the fh nanoparticles by the drying and outgassing process required for n2 adsorption bet ssafh is generally underestimated strehlau et al 2017 a theoretically derived ssafh is 600 m2 g davis et al 1978 a reliable ssafh can be experimentally obtained by employing the probe ion method using either phosphate ions hiemstra et al 2010 mendez et al 2020 see also si or protons hiemstra 2018 and applying a self consistent modeling framework ssafh values from 450 to 750 m2 g span the range found in the literature chen et al 2020 hiemstra 2018 wang et al 2013 the ssa of the fh samples was considered a parameter to be optimized by fitting the model to the adsorption data with this optimization a novel approach was used in which ssafh and c st fh were simultaneously fitted by iterative cd music esgc calculations using a consistent set of molar mass m nano mass density ρ nano and surface curvature of the fh particles mendez and hiemstra 2020b the site densities of feoh n sfeoh and fe3o n sfe3o for goe and hem were derived by the weighted sum of the site densities of each crystal facet and the corresponding cfcs the site density n sfeoh fh was determined by the surface depletion sd model and the value of n sfe3o fh was determined by fitting the charge density curves to the model hiemstra 2013 preliminary proton affinity constants of feoh logk h feoh and fe3o logk h fe3o for goe hem and fh were determined by the bond valence approach and optimized by fitting the model to the charge density curves the ion pair affinity constants logk ip a c of the monovalent background anions a and cations c were set equal and given a fixed value in the implementation of scms simultaneously fitting many model parameters may result in multiple combinations of optimal parameters that provide a reasonably good description of specific data bompoti et al 2018 lenoir et al 2010 this problem can be avoided by fixing relatively insensitive parameters so that a remaining limited number of parameters can be adjusted by regression analysis in the present study this procedure was followed fitting of the model to the various data for each hydr oxide resulted in optimized parameter values n sfeoh and n sfe3o were separately calculated logk h fe3o and logk ip were regarded as relatively insensitive parameters with fixed optimal values and logk h feoh c st and for fh ssafh were optimized by fitting the model to the data the detailed considerations are provided in the results section the values for each sample and the detailed iterative cd music esgc modeling for fh to obtain c st and ssafh are presented in the si to systematically evaluate and quantify the effect of parameter variation on the surface charge density a sensitivity analysis of the adjustable parameters was then carried out using a sample of goe antelo et al 2005 hem venema et al 1998 and fh fukushi et al 2013 the sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the targeted parameter in a reasonable range and fixing other parameters at their optimal values the sensitivity of the parameters was identified by the deviations of the calculated charge density curves from the data points at different parameter values as a complement the effect of variable parameter values on the targeted parameters was also evaluated with the sample of goe antelo et al 2005 in the sensitivity analysis si four scenarios of constant values were considered for each variable parameter and then the sensitivity could be inferred from the change of the target parameter values 2 3 generic model parameters according to the above analysis only two parameters c st and logk h feoh must be optimized with goe and hem and three parameters ssafh c st and logk h feoh must be optimized with fh these model parameters were derived by using the cd music esgc model to fit the charge density data of each oxide sample as indicated above an iterative method was used to obtain c st fh and ssafh a combination of the computer program ecosat keizer and van riemsdijk 1998 and external software fit kinniburgh and tang 1993 were used for fitting the cd music esgc model to the 35 goe 16 hem and 16 fh samples some studies have testified that the ssa had a linear correlation with the parameters bompoti et al 2018 han and katz 2019 villalobos et al 2009 the correlation potentially reflects the variation in the crystal face contributions cfcs of goethite the different dominant crystal facets of hematite and the particle size of fh following these studies the optimized parameters logk h feoh and c st were further investigated for a correlation with the measured ssa goe hem or optimized ssa fh of the samples the corresponding relationships to crystal structure particle morphology diversity and abundance of hydroxyl surface sites were comprehensively compared and analyzed to simplify the acquisition of the remaining variable parameters 2 4 parameter verification the set of generic parameters of the cd music esgc model should essentially reflect the variation in protonation reactions of the three types of iron hydr oxides and the model should accurately predict their charge density vs ph over a wide range of ionic strength values therefore to verify the applicability of the generic model parameters the charge density data of 12 samples that have not been used for the derivation of the generic model parameters see materials section and table s10 were calculated using the generic cd music esgc model and the results were compared with the measured charge densities 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis results of the effect of variable parameters on the surface charge density of goe are shown in fig 1 while those of hem and fh are depicted in fig s1 a detailed sensitivity analysis of the effect of variable parameters on the target parameters can also be found in the si 3 1 1 proton affinity constants a simple approach used for predicting the surface charge of iron hydr oxides has been to fix both logk h feoh and logk h fe3o to the pzc hiemstra et al 1996 in the present study this route has not been followed since i an indispensable prerequisite is that the pzc must be required from laborious titration data for each iron hydr oxide and ii based on the bond valence approach the two affinities differ most literature values of logk h feoh and logk h fe3o varied from 7 5 to 9 0 and from 10 5 to 12 0 respectively boily 2012 liang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 therefore for the sensitivity analysis of logk h the surface charge curves at the given conditions were calculated with logk h feoh varying from 7 5 to 9 0 fig 1a f and fig s1a f g l or logk h fe3o varying from 10 5 to 12 0 fig 1b f and fig s1b f h l similar changes in the surface charge of goe hem and fh resulted implying a comparable effect of logk h feoh or logk h fe3o in modeling the charge density of the three iron hydr oxides the calculated charge curves with logk h feoh 7 5 showed a lower pzc almost 2 units and a lower charge density than the curves calculated with logk h feoh 9 0 fig 1a and fig s1a g however the calculated charge curves with logk h fe3o at 10 5 and 12 0 almost overlapped with each other indicating that the surface charge curves were relatively insensitive to logk h fe3o fig 1b and fig s1b h the different contribution of these two surface groups to the charge development has also been found in the study of hiemstra et al 1996 attributed to two distinct logk h values for two reactive groups since logk h feoh could strongly affect the charging behavior of iron hydr oxides it was recognized as an adjustable parameter of the model the logk h fe3o was regarded as an insensitive parameter and set equal to the theoretical value of 11 7 calculated for goethite hiemstra et al 1996 evaluation of the effect of variable parameters on target parameters also led to the conclusion that the parameter logk h feoh was sensitive and logk h fe3o and logk ip were relatively insensitive see si 3 1 2 stern layer capacitances the sensitivity analysis of c st was performed within the literature range of 0 60 to 1 45 f m2 bompoti et al 2019 as shown in fig 1c f and fig s1c f i l there was a similar variation in the surface charge curves of goe hem and fh fig 1a and fig s1a g a higher c st resulted in better screening and a higher charge density while the pzc was not affected the variation in charge density was more pronounced at lower ph which demonstrated that the c st effect was ph dependent fig 1c and fig s1c i overall c st has a significant influence on the prediction of surface charge and should be set as an adjustable parameter in parameter optimization evaluation of the effect of variable parameters on target parameters also led to the conclusion that c st was a sensitive parameter see si 3 1 3 specific surface areas ssa to transform the specific charge densities c g into surface densities c m2 ssa was needed therefore the calculated charge densities were linearly affected by the ssa for goe and hem measured n2 bet ssas were used but the ssa of fh is less well known a value of ssafh 650 m2 g was used as the regular value and the literature range of 450 to 750 m2 g chen et al 2020 hiemstra 2018 wang et al 2013 was investigated in the sensitivity analysis the ssafh of 650 m2 g transformed the specific charge densities c g at relatively low surface densities c m2 fig s1 l as the charge density curves c m2 are linearly correlated with ssa this parameter should be optimized for fh unless the phosphate method hiemstra and zhao 2016 hiemstra et al 2010 is used to determine ssafh 3 1 4 site densities typically goe nanoparticles exhibit a needle shaped morphology that elongates along the crystallographic c axis they are terminated by 110 or 100 facets on the elongated facets and capped by 021 or 001 facets at the ends liang et al 2021c prélot et al 2003 the most reported fraction of 110 or 100 facets in goe varied from 90 to 70 while that of 021 or 100 facets changed from 10 to 30 livi et al 2017 salazar camacho and villalobos 2010 in this case the n sfeoh and n sfe3o of goe were in the range of 3 45 to 4 35 sites nm2 and 2 70 to 2 10 sites nm2 respectively the sensitivity analysis of n sfeoh and n sfe3o was conducted by testing two cfc combinations 90 10 and 30 70 resulting in total site densities n s goe 6 15 3 45 2 70 sites nm2 and 6 45 4 35 2 10 sites nm2 as shown in fig 1d and 1f the charge density did not change substantially by varying n s goe this result implied that n s goe n sfeoh n sfe3o was an insensitive parameter which agreed well with the results reported in previous studies sverjensky 2003 xu et al 2019 the generic values of n sfeoh and n sfe3o used with the parameter optimization were 3 45 and 2 70 site nm2 cfc90 10 for goe respectively in the present study several hem nanocrystals with known cfcs were employed and the calculated n sfeoh and n sfe3o ranged from 2 20 to 7 30 sites nm2 and 1 10 to 4 00 sites nm2 respectively the sensitivity analysis of n sfeoh and n sfe3o of hem indicated that the predicted charge curves were somewhat affected by the selected values fig s1d and f however their influence was much less significant than the effect of a variation in logk h or c st in the literature christl and kretzschmar 1999 hwang and lenhart 2008 it has been testified that for hem nanoparticles with different ssas the optimized c st values varied significantly at low ns hem 5 00 site nm2 while they were hardly affected at the high ns hem 5 00 site nm2 this result indicated that only low ns hem and c st have complementary effects in the modeling of surface charge curves in hem studies christl and kretzschmar 1999 venema et al 1998 with a total site density of approximately 7 5 sites nm2 the model could give a reasonable description for the experimental charging curves following venema et al 1998 n sfeoh 5 00 sites nm2 and n sfe3o 2 50 sites nm2 were selected as the generic site densities of hem the polyhedral composition of the fh structure was found to be particle size dependent but the average value of n sfeoh was invariant to size and obtained by the surface depletion sd model as 5 80 0 30 sites nm2 hiemstra 2013 furthermore by using n sfeoh 5 80 sites nm2 the average n sfe3o fh value acquired from fitting the charge density curves was 1 40 0 50 site nm2 these values correspond well with previous studies hiemstra 2018 mendez and hiemstra 2020c the relatively low value can be attributed to the mutual charge compensation of the sites with different types of coordinated o atoms hiemstra and zhao 2016 therefore n sfeoh fh 5 80 site nm2 and n sfe3o fh 1 40 site nm2 were adopted as generic values 3 1 5 ion pair affinity constant the literature range of logk ip of common monovalent background ions is from 1 00 to 0 36 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2006 mendez and hiemstra 2020b compared to the effect of varying logk h feoh and c st values the slight deviation from the 1 1 line of logk ip demonstrated its relative insensitivity to the prediction of the charge density of goe hem and fh fig 1e f and fig s1e f k l similar observations were reported in previous work rahnemaie et al 2006 rietra et al 2000 additional model calculations were also conducted with the six iron hydr oxide samples to analyze the effect of asymmetric logk ip values in modeling the surface charge densities si the results indicated only a very weak influence of asymmetric logk ip on the charge densities table s6 therefore logk ip was fixed as a generic constant and the commonly used value of 0 50 for most 1 1 background electrolytes was employed for both cations and anions 3 2 optimal parameters and correlations with the specific surface areas 3 2 1 optimized parameters the model parameter settings of the cd music esgc model are summarized in table s7 each sample in the surface charge database was separately modeled to obtain the adjustable parameters logk h feoh and c st for goe and hem and ssa logk h feoh and c st for fh by fitting the model to the data a comparison of the calculated and experimental results can be found in figs s3 s5 and the optimized parameters have been collected in table s8 in the subsequent sections the correlations between logk h feoh or c st and ssa are investigated 3 2 2 logkh feoh and ssa according to the result of a p value test in the correlation analysis there was no linear relationship between the ssa and logk h feoh therefore the values of logk h feoh were considered to be independent of the ssa the distribution of optimal logk h feoh values for different types of iron hydr oxides is depicted in fig 2 a the values of logk h feoh vary from 7 8 to 8 8 among different iron hydr oxide samples this result corresponds well with the range of logk h feoh for different types of iron hydr oxides reported in the literature in fact compared to the logk h of other metal oxides such as logk h aloh 9 87 for gibbsite park 2018 and logk h mnoⅰ 16 0 16 5 logk h mn2oⅱ ⅲ 0 3 1 4 logk h mn2mnioⅳ 2 5 3 4 and logk h mn3mnⅴ 9 8 11 4 for birnessite zhao et al 2018 the range of logk h feoh was sufficiently narrow to reflect the surface reactivity of iron hydr oxides the descriptive statistics suggested a mean value of logk h feoh of 8 30 0 30 standard deviation for the three types of iron hydr oxides based on the bond valence approach logk h of a specific site is predominated by the type and number of coordinating ions of o atoms rather than the structural differences among the iron hydr oxides boily 2012 bompoti et al 2019 specifically the value of logk h feoh was linked to the distance between the o atom and coordinating fe atoms hiemstra et al 1996 due to the similar octahedron fe presented at the surface of different iron hydr oxides and the similar fe o distance 1 94 2 10 å in the octahedron fe it was reasonable that different types of iron hydr oxides have an approximate logk h feoh villalobos et al 2009 although the range of logk h feoh of fh was slightly larger than that of goe and hem the median value was similar to that of goe and hem according to michel et al 2007 2010 logk h feoh of fh is somewhat affected by the structural relaxation in lattice dimensions of fh nanoparticles which may result in somewhat lower values than that of goe or hem the relatively small differences in octahedron fe arrangements among the iron hydr oxides imply some difference in the location of surface groups in the octahedral crystal chain and local microenvironment schwertmann and cornel 2008 accordingly logk h feoh was only slightly affected by the microstructure of the surface sites of the iron hydr oxides but located in a relatively narrow range 3 2 3 cst and ssa the correlation between c st and ssa is depicted in figs 2b to 2d for goe hem and fh respectively the ssa of goe and hem was negatively correlated with the c st while that of fh was positively correlated with the c st the linear correlations between c st and ssa were c st 0 0058 ssa 1 52 n 35 for goe c st 0 038 ssa 2 39 n 16 for hem and c st 0 00027 ssa 0 976 n 16 for fh thus a lower ssa of goe or hem corresponded to a higher c st value the ssa depends on the crystal structure which in turn affects the site density n s as n s is fixed in the model actual variations in n s will be at least partly accounted for by variations in c st goe crystals generally showed a high ratio of length to width fig s7 and a decreasing ssa with increasing length table s1 simultaneously the cfcs of the 001 facet notably increased due to the replacement of the original 110 facet by the step like growth of alternating 110 and 001 facets salazar camacho and villalobos 2010 weidler et al 1996 this resulted in higher site densities for goe with increasing length decreasing ssa charging is promoted by both high n s and high c st as n s is fixed an increase in c st is needed according to lützenkirchen et al 2008 and sverjensky 2005 a high surface potential leads to a strong attraction of the counterions which leads to a small distance between counterions on the goethite surface and a high c st however this would make the c st potential and charge dependent and increase the specific counterion adsorption with increasing electrostatic attraction which also enhances proton dissociation which is included in the model hem nanocubes and nanospheres were commonly enclosed by the 012 facet while hem nanoplates and rhombohedrons were dominated by the 001 facet huang et al 2018 more importantly the 001 facets of hem only contain the doubly coordinated fe2oh sites which were considered nonactive in contrast with the 012 facet with abundant feoh and fe3o sites lv et al 2018 in addition the feoh and fe3o sites were arranged in a series of ridges and valleys on the surface of the 012 facets which was observably different from the flat arrangement of surface sites on the 001 and 110 facets catalano et al 2007 thus it can be inferred that the variation in c st of hem particles was related to their cfcs according to previous studies huang et al 2016 lv et al 2018 hematite nanoparticles dominated by 012 facets generally exhibited a lower ssa value than those dominated by 001 facets this difference is likely the main reason for the correlation between c st and ssa in addition to the difference in site composition on individual hem facets the spatial configuration of surface o atoms and the surface rugosity may affect the c st of hem nanoparticles as indicated in refs hwang and lenhart 2008 schudel et al 1997 for hematite nanocrystals with the same morphology an increased surface roughness and particle porosity larger ssa resulted in decreased c st hiemstra et al 2013 indicated that idealized fh particles developed a nearly spherical or hexagonal morphology constructed by the 110 and 021 like facets with 001 like terminations the mineral and surface structure of fh was found to be particle size dependent hiemstra and zhao 2016 according to ssafh 6 ρ nano d where ρ nano is the mass density and d is the spherical particle diameter a decrease in particle size d corresponds with an increased ssafh according to the capacitance equation of a spherical condenser c st c st flat d δd d hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2009 where δd is the thickness of the total stern layer and c st flat is the capacitance of a flat surface hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2006 c st will increase with decreasing particle size since ρ nano and δd are approximately constant it follows that c st will tend to increase with increasing ssafh the approximately spherical shape of fh causes a trend that is opposite to that of goe and hem 3 3 generic model parameters the generic model parameters derived after the evaluation of sensitivity analysis and the parameter optimization are summarized in table 1 together with the correlations the insensitive parameters logk h fe3o n s goe n sfeoh n sfe3o goe n s hem n sfeoh n sfe3o hem and logk ip a logk ip c were set as constant values of 11 7 3 45 2 70 5 00 2 50 and 0 5 respectively the median logk h feoh of goe hem and fh was 8 3 0 3 and the recommended values for goe hem and fh were 8 3 8 6 and 8 0 respectively the ssas of goe and hem should be measured by the n2 bet method brunauer et al 1938 van den hul and lyklema 1968 while that of fh should be measured by the phosphate method hiemstra et al 2010 mendez et al 2020 rather than using the standard value of davis et al 1978 with known ssa c st can be calculated using the iron hydr oxide specific correlation between c st and ssa the generic proton constants indicated the similarity in intrinsic surface properties i e similar octahedral fe presented at the surface of different iron hydr oxides the differences in site density can be attributed to the differences in the octahedral fe arrangements schwertmann and cornell 2008 and cfcs lützenkirchen et al 2008 differences in the stern layer capacitance are due to actual differences in site density surface roughness schudel et al 1997 composition and spatial distribution of the surface sites lv et al 2018 and particle shape hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2009 the set of generic model parameters can greatly mitigate the computational intensity and describe the surface reactivity of goe hem and fh 3 4 parameter verification to verify the quality of the generic parameters the parameters were substituted into the cd music esgc model to predict the charge density curves of a series of 12 samples specified in table s10 6 goe 4 hem and 2 fh at different ionic strengths the comparison of the predicted and experimental charge densities is displayed in fig 3 the correlation between the predicted charge density y and experimental charge density x could be fitted by a linear equation y 0 96x 0 005 i e the slope was close to 1 the intercept was approximately 0 and most data points fell into the 95 prediction interval this indicated that the cd music esgc model with generic parameters provided a satisfactory prediction of the charge density behavior of the three iron hydr oxides further information can be found in fig s8 where the experimental and predicted charge density curves are depicted these results indicate that the deviation of the model primarily occurred at low ph where the experimental error of surface charge determination with acid base titration was relatively high the charge density c m2 of goe fig s8a f and hem fig s8g j decreased with increasing ssa whereas that of fh fig s8k and l only slightly increased this corresponds with the observed correlations between c st and the ssa similar trends have also been indicated in the literature bompoti et al 2017 villalobos and antelo 2011 due to the fixed logk h logk ip and n s values for goe hem and fh differences in structure and or shape that led to differences in ssa also led to differences in c st 4 conclusions the present study provides a set of generic parameters for the cd music esgc model which allows prediction of the surface charge density of iron hydr oxides once their ssa is known this result is a good balance between simplification of the model calculation and an adequate prediction of the proton activity of iron hydr oxides the generic parameters have been obtained by a comprehensive reanalysis of literature datasets of goe hem and fh by the cd music esgc model with fixed site densities for each iron hydr oxide similar proton and monovalent ion pair affinity constants were established for the different iron hydr oxides for a good correspondence with experimental results an adjustable stern layer capacitance was needed the obtained capacitances showed a simple linear correlation with the ssa therefore it can simply be obtained when the ssa of the iron hydr oxide is known the applicability of the generic parameters has been verified by comparing the model results with the charge density data of 12 additional samples the generic parameters encapsulate the variation in surface sites face distributions and the similarities in the basic structural unit of various iron hydr oxides and greatly relaxed the connection between the model parameters and the diverse mineralogical properties compared to the material specific parameters of the traditional cd music model the significance of generic parameters in this study is that complicated characterization and acid base titration were unnecessary for the prediction of surface reactivity table s11 the cd music esgc model using the generic parameters for iron hydr oxides can also be a valuable tool in modeling iron hydr oxides in natural systems especially when a detailed characterization of the samples is absent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15169,with the frequent occurrence of extreme floods under global climate change induced storm events reservoir operation has been highlighted for river flood control complicating the transport and transformation of riverine dissolved organic matter dom one of the largest reactive carbon pools on earth in particular the response of riverine dom chemistry to reservoir flood control during extreme storm events is still unclear to fill this knowledge gap the mechanism of dom variation in yangtze river with the world s largest three gorges reservoir tgr operation during an extreme storm event was explored optical and molecular properties of dom varied significantly from upstream to downstream in non tgr area while no significant variation in dom chemistry was observed in tgr area the results uncovered a short time transformation of dom from non tgr area to tgr area demonstrating that although storm event induced chemodiversity bloom of riverine dom flood control of tgr re constrained dom to more similar chemistry mainly under the influence of turbidity involved dom transformation e g adsorption desorption and flocculation furthermore combined with the hydrological information we found that although tgr temporarily blocked dissolved organic carbon doc flow during the flood event the abundance of biologically recalcitrant doc increased in tgr which would contribute to its further transportation to downstream watershed this study emphasizes the impact of tgr on extreme storm event induced dom dynamics which also hints a better understanding of the crucial role of anthropogenic

pattern change has increased severely in recent years milly et al 2002 prein et al 2017 in the flood control mode of a reservoir flood peak upstream would be whittled by rapid water storage in the reservoir and be drained gradually to downstream watershed the flood control of reservoir would offset the shock of flood on the stability of the river system and reduce the flood risk downstream boulange et al 2021 however the ecological and biogeochemical influence of flood control of reservoir especially the response of organic matter om chemistry is still unclear as one of the most reactive carbon pools dissolved organic matter dom is involved extensively in nearly all biogeochemical processes and its chemistry e g composition and sources would be a crucial indicator of aquatic ecosystem variation leenheer and croué 2003 stedmon et al 2003 to be specific the peptide compounds in dom are usually biolabile cory and kaplan 2012 he et al 2020b and devote significantly to the transmission of chemical energy in the biological chain and greenhouse gasses ghg emissions in aquatic ecosystems dinsmore et al 2013 meanwhile aromatic compounds in dom are resistant to microbial processing and relate closely to the long time turnover of organic carbon pool jiao et al 2010 zhang et al 2018a furthermore storm induced high discharge has been proved to devote to the general increase of dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in stream and river systems e g raymond et al 2016 besides dom composition also could be altered by storm events for instance there was an increasing trend of aromaticity and humification of dom for surficial source input e g soil leachate induced by storm events inamdar et al 2011 while the relative abundance of protein like component of dom also increased in a wetland dominated watershed during stormflows fellman et al 2009 meanwhile reservoir operation is demonstrated to introduce a large amount of autochthonous doc through water retention time alteration burford et al 2007 hur et al 2014 therefore the combination of natural storm events and artificial reservoir operation would complex the hydrological variations and alter the dom dynamic more severely nevertheless systematic research on the dom chemistry under flood control of reservoirs during storm events remains lacking the complicated composition and sources of dom

kujawinski 2002 nebbioso and piccolo 2013 in this study we focus on the extreme storm event in july 2018 recorded as the largest flood event since 2012 on yangtze river zhang et al 2018b three gorges reservoir tgr the world s largest reservoir located on the yangtze river activates the flood control mode and is operated to rapidly raise the reservoir water level by ca 10 m in 7 days to store water and alleviate the flood impact chen et al 2018 with tgr operation water retention time increases while the flux decreases significantly from non tgr area to tgr area in a short time dong et al 2019 in our previous works the hydrological variation induced by the routinely gradual operation of tgr has been proven to significantly influence dom composition reactivity and biogeochemical processes wang et al 2019 2021 however in flood control mode of tgr with the more extreme variation of hydrological conditions than routine operation dom dynamic is likely more complex but has yet to be explored therefore we investigate the dom dynamic from non tgr area to tgr area during the extreme flood event in addition considering the outstanding performance of eems and ft icr ms in characterizing dom property we use a series of techniques from bulk to molecular levels to trace the complex transportation and transformation behaviors of different dom components the goal is to characterize the response of dom chemistry to tgr flood control during an extreme storm event and probe a better understanding of carbon cycling during extreme climate changes 2 methodology 2 1 investigated area

selection was applied to the coefficient of variation calculation of dom among non tgr area and tgr area for chemodiversity comparison specifically 5 of 13 dom samples in non tgr area were randomly selected for 1000 times and the coefficient of variation was compared among 5 selected dom samples in non tgr area and 5 dom samples in tgr area for dom variation among non tgr area and tgr area

significantly different variation regime among non tgr area and tgr area higher turbidity value was observed downstream than upstream in non tgr area meanwhile lower turbidity value was observed downstream than upstream in tgr area which might result from reservoir operation induced enhancement of sinking of particles table s1 concentrations of na mg2 k ca2 ranged from 0 18 to 2 43 mmol

and a decreasing trend of δ13c along the upstream to downstream transect were observed in non tgr area while no apparent variation was observed in tgr area fig s4 in terms of optical properties fi hix fri and bix were 1 58 1 77 0 84 0 91 0 69 0 81 and 0 72 0 83 respectively in non tgr area while 1 70 1 75 0 87 0 89 0 73 0 75 and 0 74 0 78 respectively in tgr area figs 2 a s3d f although there were similar average values of fi hix fri and bix among non tgr area and tgr area wider ranges of fi hix fri and bix in non tgr area than those in tgr area were observed figs 2a s3d f in the parafac model of eems three humic like components c1 ex em 250 280 380 480 nm c2 ex em 250 380 470 nm c3 ex em 265 300 340 380 nm and two protein like components c4 ex em 260 280 300 360 nm c5 ex em 245 255 290 340

unit all showed wider ranges in non tgr area than those in tgr area fig 2b c in addition in non tgr area abundances of humic like and protein like components increased from upstream to downstream while no general variation in tgr area fig 3 a b e f potentially clarifying that the composition of dom was altered during its mobilization from non tgr area to tgr area during the flood event in terms of molecular parameters 9346 formulas 3340 of cho 3876 of chon 1513 of chos 617 of chons were identified in non tgr area and tgr area total of 8561 formulas 2951 of cho 3617 of chon 1427 of chos 566 of chons and 7385 formulas 2746 of cho 3135 of chon 1102 of chos 402 of chons were identified in non tgr area and tgr area respectively fig s6 with 6600 formulas 2357 of cho 2876 of chon 1016 of chos 351 of chons shared the relatively higher ratio value of common unique formulas in tgr area 42 than that in non tgr area 23 demonstrated that although similar molecular composition was observed dom in tgr area generally shared more similar chemistry than in non tgr area the relative abundance of cho chon chos and chons varied little among non tgr area cho 39 4 0 1 chon 41 6 0 1 chos 15 2 0 1 chons 3 9 0 1 and tgr area cho 38 9 0 1 chon 42 0 0 1 chos 14 6 0 1 chons 4 5 0 1 aimod dbe and m z exhibited wider ranges with relatively lower average values in non tgr area aimod 0 286 0 002 dbe 9

84 0 55 than in tgr area 11 17 0 55 in terms of molecular groups the average relative abundances of pcas hu poly and ua peptides were 92 27 0 46 and 5 86 0 40 respectively in non tgr area while 93 16 0 27 and 5 07 0 24 respectively in tgr area fig 2e f relative abundance of pcas hu poly increased from upstream to downstream in non tgr area 89 09 to 95 13 while ua peptides varied oppositely 3 37 to

formulas varied from 48 07 to 53 63 in non tgr area while 52 03 to 54 25 in tgr area 4 discussion 4 1 storm event induced chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area to characterize the storm event influenced dom chemistry and probe its dynamic mechanism in non tgr area comprehensively the optical molecular linkage assessment of dom during the storm event and its comparison with that of dom during normal discharge he et al 2020b were carried out fig s8 there were limited associations between optical and molecular characteristics of dom during the storm event which is different from dom during normal discharge significant association among nearly all relevant optical and molecular parameters fig s8 indicating the relatively independent source input of fluorescent dom and spe dom pools during the storm event blough et al 1993 köhler et al 2013 in particular hix and aimod the parameters relating to humification degree of fluorescent dom and aromaticity of spe dom respectively have been shown to track the similar dom pool during normal discharge wagner et al 2015 he et al 2020b nevertheless exhibited no significant correlation indicating the limited overlap between humified and aromatic compounds during the flood period fig s8 moreover fri and bix which represent fresh dom by autochthonous production tracked a few molecular information and demonstrated limited overlapping between fresh fluorescent dom and molecular formula identified from spe dom fig s8a the inconsistent variation of optical and molecular properties might also be related to the chemodiversity enhancement of dom during the storm event which was further supported by the pca analysis fig s9 pc1 exhibited positive loadings relating to aliphatic compounds of spe dom and parafac components of fluorescent dom while negative loadings relating to aromatic dom associated parameters e g aromatic compounds dbe and aimod of spe dom and humification degree of fluorescent dom pc2 exhibited positive loadings relating to fresh dom associated parameters e g bix and fri the positive and negative loadings of pc1 and pc2 separated all samples from each other indicating high composition heterogeneity and chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area during the storm event besides that pca further suggested that environmental factors also affected dom chemistry in non tgr area during the storm event fig s9 specifically sio3 2 po4 3 and din showed positive loading of pc1 and were located in similar positions of parafac components indicating that the nutrient input related closely to the abundances of fluorescent dom during the storm event unlike nutrient status influenced fluorescent dom addition through primary productivity e g algal bloom under normal hydrological conditions yamashita et al 2007 the short water residence time during storm event would limit the linkage between nutrients and primary productivity bargu et al 2019 which indicated that nutrient and fluorescent dom are likely derived from similar sources considering the enrichment of nutrients and terrestrially colored dom in riparian soils heffernan and sponseller 2004 storm event induced soil erosion and runoff reinforcing would significantly influence nutrient and fluorescent dom addition in river systems fellman et al 2008 with the scattered distribution of dom samples from non tgr area in pca land types and ions also affected the dom chemistry at the molecular level fig s9 ca2 k vegetational land and urban land had positive loadings on pc1 demonstrating their potential influences on the composition of fluorescent dom in contrast mg2 na bare land and farmland had negative loadings on pc1 which related closely to the molecular composition and characteristics of spe dom mg2 and na are located at a similar position with m z dbe and pcas hu poly suggesting that the input of mg2 and na are consistent with the enrichment of pcas hu poly with high molecular weight and unsaturation which could also be accounted by the storm event induced contribution enhancement of rock weathering and soil erosion oliva et al 1999 li et al 2011 in addition bare land and farmland are located at a similar position to aimod with negative loadings of pc1 indicating their positive correlation with the aromaticity of spe dom this relationship was further confirmed by the positive spearman correlation between bare land and farmland and individual molecular formulas with high o c and low h c values fig s10 considering aromatic molecules of dom exhibited low h c values koch and dittmar 2006 since bare land and farmland are subjected to severe soil erosion for its limited water and land conservation ouyang et al 2010 as well as the enrichment of aromatic dom formulas masese et al 2017 he et al 2021 storm event induced soil scour would contribute to the association between bare land and farmland and aromaticity of dom in non tgr area in general with comprehensive analyses of environmental factors and dom variations the storm event induced high chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area 4 2 flood control of reservoir reconstrained dom to more similar chemistry in contrast to significant variations of dom chemistry e g bulk optical and molecular levels in non tgr area more homogeneous characteristics of dom in tgr area were observed figs 2 3 s3 s4 increasing trends of doc and tdn and a decreasing trend of δ13c were observed along upstream to downstream transect in non tgr area suggesting the increasing of terrestrial derived doc with storm event induced flood cifuentes and eldridge 1998 the abundances of c1 c2 c3 and c4 c5 also increased from upstream to downstream suggesting humic like and protein like fluorescent components accelerated more downstream than upstream fig 3a b a decreasing trend of the relative abundance of pcas hu poly was observed while ua peptides varied oppositely indicating the spatial dynamic of the molecular composition of dom in non tgr area fig 3c d nevertheless unlike in non tgr area a slight variation of these parameters was observed in tgr area fig 3e h moreover the coefficient of variation comparison of dom parameters among non tgr area and tgr area was conducted uniformly distributed random numbers selection n 5 equivalent to the number of dom samples in tgr area among samples in non tgr area for 1000 times still exhibit higher coefficient of variation of dom parameters e g δ13c c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 mlbl pcas hu poly ua peptides in non tgr area than those in tgr area demonstrating higher chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area than in tgr area fig s7 the variation of dom chemistry between non tgr area and tgr area was also characterized by pca fig 4 the loadings of pc1 and pc2 represented 58 of the variations compared to the scattered distribution of dom samples in non tgr area dom samples in tgr area are centered in a small area indicating more heterogeneous and homogeneous properties of dom in non tgr area and tgr area respectively dom in non tgr area was transported rapidly by flood which lasted for 6 days to tgr area during the storm event it was subject to retention in tgr area under the flood control mode of tgr resulting in a rapid and significant transformation of dom chemistry from non tgr area to tgr area to explore the potential underlying transformation behaviors e g biodegradation and photodegradation of dom stubbins et al 2010 catalán et al 2017 a comparison of molecular formulas constrained from biodegradation and photodegradation incubation experiments 7 days was performed detailed in supplementary materials only a few formulas were identified as biodegradable 4 or photodegradable 10 in the unique molecule pool in non tgr area compared to tgr area fig s11 this indicated that although biodegradation and photodegradation were crucial ways of dom transformation the quick transportation from non tgr area to tgr area induced by the flood might not allow enough time for significant microbial or photochemical degradation saadi et al 2006 hansen et al 2016 moreover a significant correlation between doc and turbidity was observed indicating that turbidity might involve significantly in the dom chemistry from non tgr area to tgr area fig s12a which was further supported by the spearman correlation between turbidity and numerous molecular formulas fig s12b the interaction between dom and particulate organic matter pom has been considered an essential part of biogeochemical processes he et al 2016 lee et al 2021 valiente et al 2022 the adsorption desorption or flocculation of specific compounds could significantly modulate dom composition helms et al 2013 asmala et al 2014 integrated with the significant correlation between dom characteristics and turbidity the turbidity involved dom transformation e g adsorption desorption and flocculation might be a key factor regulating higher chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area to lower chemodiversity in tgr area during the storm event fig s13 therefore a conceptual model was presented to show the response of dom chemistry to flood control of tgr during the extreme storm event fig 5 storm event induced flood resulted in the chemodiversity bloom of dom in non tgr area under high velocity nevertheless the control mode activation of tgr re constrained dom to more similar chemistry under lower velocity through the modulation mainly by turbidity involved dom transformation e g adsorption desorption and flocculation and photodegradation and biodegradation contributed partly to the variation of dom 4 3 biogeochemical implications and limitations characterizing dom property at multiple levels demonstrated the dynamic processes of dom from non tgr area to tgr area during the storm event to assess the dom variation more comprehensively we compared the dom chemistry of this study with other rivers during storm events the molecular comparison of dom among storm event influenced yangtze river and other rivers was further conducted based on h c and o c fig s14 lee et al 2019 wagner et al 2019 wide ranges of h c and o c values were observed in storm influenced river systems also supporting the chemodiversity bloom induced by storm events while reservoir samples flocked together closely indicated the constraint of reservoir flood control to dom chemistry as a crucial component of organic carbon dom is related closely to most carbon transformation processes and the flood control influenced dom dynamic would exert influence on regional carbon cycling hansell and carlson 2001 cram compounds the primary component of refractory marine dom have been estimated to widely persist in inland waters and play a key role in carbon flux among aquatic ecosystems hertkorn et al 2006 lam et al 2007 therefore we used cram as an index for the refractory part of dom despite various factors e g spe efficiency influencing molecular identification molecular flux comparison could still provide non negligible information on carbon cycling kurek et al 2022 during the storm event the discharge flow in tgr is up to 60 000 m3 s combined with the cram content averaged 51 doc concentration averaged 2 0 mg l and spe extraction efficiency 65 the highest cram flux flow in non tgr area was 0 39 105 g c s 1 which was lower than the average values in amazon river 2 99 105 g c s and congo river 1 76 105 g c s kurek et al 2022 table s2 under flood control mode tgr retained flood water of ca 6 3 billion m3 chen et al 2018 combined with the dom property in non tgr area doc 2 0 mg l cram 51 and tgr area doc 2 5 mg l cram 53 we estimated that extra cram of ca 1 2 109 g c was formed in tgr due to the flood control which was resistant to biodegradation and would be drained to recalcitrant doc pool downstream therefore our investigation uncovered that although limiting flood transport and cushioning the shock on riverine ecosystems flood control of reservoirs likely enhanced the transport of recalcitrant doc although we purposely designed and carried out the investigation in this study limitations still exist for instance the sampling sites are set according to topography for logistical and security reasons resulting in limited coverage of the upstream area furthermore for the high velocity of the flood only surface water samples are collected and a vertical sampling including middle and bottom water samples and sediment samples is needed to better clarification of the vertical dynamic of dom from water column to sediment moreover further comprehensive analysis e g fe3 measurement and quantitative evaluation of various factors adsorption desorption photodegradation and biodegradation potentially regulating dom dynamics are still needed nevertheless considering investigation security during the extreme flood this study utilized a valuable field sample set to explore the dom dynamic in the context of flood control of reservoirs our study provides a novel insight into the biogeochemical role of reservoir operation during the flood which would help to better constrain the influence of extreme climate change on riverine carbon cycling and the role of anthropogenic activity e g reservoir operation in tackling extreme climate change 5 conclusion this work carried out a comprehensive investigation of the response of dom chemistry to tgr flood control during an extreme storm event different variations of dom chemistry from bulk optical and molecular levels among non tgr area and tgr area were uncovered increasing trends of doc and tdn concentrations and a decreasing trend of δ13c from upstream to downstream were observed in non tgr area in contrast no significant variation in dom chemistry was observed in tgr area in addition based on optical and molecular information provided by eems and ft icr ms the chemodiversity bloom of dom in non tgr area was observed which might result from the addition of storm event induced organic matter nevertheless flood control of tgr was observed to re constrain dom to more similar chemistry in tgr area mainly through turbidity involved dom transformation e g adsorption desorption and flocculation integrated with the hydrological information we further suggested that flood control of tgr not only influenced the dom chemistry but also enhanced the transport amount of recalcitrant molecular formulas during the extreme storm event with global climate changes extreme storm event induced floods will likely increase widely further highlighting the function of reservoirs in flood control the comprehensive investigation of reservoir influenced dom dynamics during storm events would therefore hint at a new insight into understanding how extreme climate change influenced carbon

15169,with the frequent occurrence of extreme floods under global climate change induced storm events reservoir operation has been highlighted for river flood control complicating the transport and transformation of riverine dissolved organic matter dom one of the largest reactive carbon pools on earth in particular the response of riverine dom chemistry to reservoir flood control during extreme storm events is still unclear to fill this knowledge gap the mechanism of dom variation in yangtze river with the world s largest three gorges reservoir tgr operation during an extreme storm event was explored optical and molecular properties of dom varied significantly from upstream to downstream in non tgr area while no significant variation in dom chemistry was observed in tgr area the results uncovered a short time transformation of dom from non tgr area to tgr area demonstrating that although storm event induced chemodiversity bloom of riverine dom flood control of tgr re constrained dom to more similar chemistry mainly under the influence of turbidity involved dom transformation e g adsorption desorption and flocculation furthermore combined with the hydrological information we found that although tgr temporarily blocked dissolved organic carbon doc flow during the flood event the abundance of biologically recalcitrant doc increased in tgr which would contribute to its further transportation to downstream watershed this study emphasizes the impact of tgr on extreme storm event induced dom dynamics which also hints a better understanding of the crucial role of anthropogenic

of dom also increased in a wetland dominated watershed during stormflows fellman et al 2009 meanwhile reservoir operation is demonstrated to introduce a large amount of autochthonous doc through water retention time alteration burford et al 2007 hur et al 2014 therefore the combination of natural storm events and artificial reservoir operation would complex the hydrological variations and alter the dom dynamic more severely nevertheless systematic research on the dom chemistry under flood control of reservoirs during storm events remains lacking the complicated composition and sources of dom always limit our understanding of dom cycling leenheer and croué 2003 therefore for a comprehensive depiction of dom property multiple characterization methods are introduced in addition to the conventional bulk approach e g stable carbon isotope for source tracing cawley et al 2012 optical techniques e g excitation emission matrixes eems have been widely applied to the quantification and

kujawinski 2002 nebbioso and piccolo 2013 in this study we focus on the extreme storm event in july 2018 recorded as the largest flood event since 2012 on yangtze river zhang et al 2018b three gorges reservoir tgr the world s largest reservoir located on the yangtze river activates the flood control mode and is operated to rapidly raise the reservoir water level by ca 10 m in 7 days to store water and alleviate the flood impact chen et al 2018 with tgr operation water retention time increases while the flux decreases significantly from non tgr area to tgr area in a short time dong et al 2019 in our previous works the hydrological variation induced by the routinely gradual operation of tgr has been proven to significantly influence dom composition reactivity and biogeochemical processes wang et al 2019 2021 however in flood control mode of tgr with the more extreme variation of hydrological conditions than routine operation dom dynamic is likely more complex but has yet to be explored therefore we investigate the dom dynamic from non tgr area to tgr area during the extreme flood event in addition considering the outstanding performance of eems and ft icr ms in characterizing dom property we use a series of techniques from bulk to molecular levels to trace the complex transportation and transformation behaviors of different dom components the goal is to characterize the response of dom chemistry to tgr flood control during an extreme storm event and probe a better understanding of carbon cycling during extreme climate changes 2 methodology 2 1 investigated area

selection was applied to the coefficient of variation calculation of dom among non tgr area and tgr area for chemodiversity comparison specifically 5 of 13 dom samples in non tgr area were randomly selected for 1000 times and the coefficient of variation was compared among 5 selected dom samples in non tgr area and 5 dom samples in tgr area for dom variation among non tgr area and tgr area principal component analysis pca was conducted based on bulk optical and molecular indexes e g land types ions nutrients δ13c doc tdn optical and molecular parameters in addition spearman s correlation between dom formulas and bulk indexes e g land types was carried out to explore the underlying controlling mechanism of dom chemistry 3 results 3 1 hydrological variation of non tgr area

104 m3 s on july 16th 2018 with ca 5 0 104 m3 s for nearly 50 h chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b dong et al 2019 the suspended particulate concentration reached 4 47 kg m3 on july 13th 2018 the second highest value since 2011 yangtze river water resources commission the data was observed at the cuntan station fig 1 in tgr area tgr has increased draining flux and decreased water level for flood control capacity preparation before the flood qin et al 2020 during the flood period with tgr operation the outflow flux from tgr maintained at around 4 2 104 m3 s and suspended particulate concentration was reduced to 1 4 kg m3 badong observation station fig 1 dong et al 2019 yuan et al 2022 in addition tgr enhanced water storage and increased water level up to ca 10 m in 7 days to alleviate the flood 3 2 water quality characteristics temperature ranged from 20 2 to 27 9 c with higher values downstream than upstream in non tgr area while exhibiting a relative homogeneousness in tgr area 24 3 to 25 8 c table s1 no spatial variation of ph was observed in both non tgr area averaged value 8 38 0 12 and tgr area averaged value 8 47 0 09 table s1 in contrast turbidity showed a significantly different variation regime among non tgr area and tgr area higher turbidity value was observed downstream than upstream in non tgr area meanwhile lower turbidity value was observed downstream than upstream in tgr area which might result from reservoir operation induced enhancement of sinking of particles table s1 concentrations of na mg2 k ca2 ranged from 0 18 to 2 43 mmol

ranges and higher average values of na mg2 k ca2 in non tgr area than in tgr area indicating more contribution of rock and soil in flood influenced non tgr area li et al 2011 nutrient concentrations

tgr area fig s2 3 3 properties of dom from bulk to the molecular level there were relatively wider ranges of doc concentrations δ13c and tdn concentrations in non tgr area than those in tgr area fig

and a decreasing trend of δ13c along the upstream to downstream transect were observed in non tgr area while no apparent variation was observed in tgr area fig s4 in terms of optical properties fi hix fri and bix were 1 58 1 77 0 84 0 91 0 69 0 81 and 0 72 0 83 respectively in non tgr area while 1 70 1 75 0 87 0 89 0 73 0 75 and 0 74 0 78 respectively in tgr area figs 2 a s3d f although there were similar average values of fi hix fri and bix among non tgr area and tgr area wider ranges of fi hix fri and bix in non tgr area than those in tgr area were observed figs 2a s3d f in the parafac model of eems three humic like components c1 ex em 250 280 380 480 nm c2 ex em 250 380 470 nm c3 ex em 265 300 340 380 nm and two protein like components c4 ex em 260 280 300 360 nm c5 ex em 245 255 290 340 nm were identified fig s5 yamashita et al 2010a 2010b jørgensen et al 2011 murphy et al 2011 osburn et al 2012 abundances of humic like c1 c2 c3 and protein like components c4 c5 normalized as raman unit all showed wider ranges in non tgr area than those in tgr area fig 2b c in addition in non tgr area abundances of humic like and protein like components increased from upstream to downstream while no general variation in tgr area fig 3 a b e f potentially clarifying that the composition of dom was altered during its mobilization from non tgr area to tgr area during the flood event in terms of molecular parameters 9346 formulas 3340 of cho 3876 of chon 1513 of chos 617 of chons were identified in non tgr area and tgr area total of 8561 formulas 2951 of cho 3617 of chon 1427 of chos 566 of chons and 7385 formulas 2746 of cho 3135 of chon 1102 of chos 402 of chons were identified in non tgr area and tgr area respectively fig s6 with 6600 formulas 2357 of cho 2876 of chon 1016 of chos 351 of chons shared the relatively higher ratio value of common unique formulas in tgr area 42 than that in non tgr area 23 demonstrated that although similar molecular composition was observed dom in tgr area generally shared more similar chemistry than in non tgr area the relative abundance of cho chon chos and chons varied little among non tgr area cho 39 4 0 1 chon 41 6 0 1 chos 15 2 0 1 chons 3 9 0 1 and tgr area cho 38 9 0 1 chon 42 0 0 1 chos 14 6 0 1 chons 4 5 0 1 aimod dbe and m z exhibited wider ranges with relatively lower average values in non tgr area aimod 0 286 0 002 dbe 9

84 0 55 than in tgr area 11 17 0 55 in terms of molecular groups the average relative abundances of pcas hu poly and ua peptides were 92 27 0 46 and 5 86 0 40 respectively in non tgr area while 93 16 0 27 and 5 07 0 24 respectively in tgr area fig 2e f relative abundance of pcas hu poly increased from upstream to downstream in non tgr area 89 09 to 95 13 while ua peptides varied oppositely 3 37 to

formulas varied from 48 07 to 53 63 in non tgr area while 52 03 to 54 25 in tgr area 4 discussion 4 1 storm event induced chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area to characterize the storm event influenced dom chemistry and probe its dynamic mechanism in non tgr area comprehensively the optical molecular linkage assessment of dom during the storm event and its comparison with that of dom during normal discharge he et al 2020b were carried out fig s8 there were limited associations between optical and molecular characteristics of dom during the storm event which is different from dom during normal discharge significant association among nearly all relevant optical and molecular parameters fig s8 indicating the relatively independent source input of fluorescent dom and spe dom pools during the storm event blough et al 1993 köhler et al 2013 in particular hix and aimod the parameters relating to humification degree of fluorescent dom and aromaticity of spe dom respectively have been shown to track the similar dom pool during normal discharge wagner et al 2015 he et al 2020b nevertheless exhibited no significant correlation indicating the limited overlap between humified and aromatic compounds during the flood period fig s8 moreover fri and bix which represent fresh dom by autochthonous production tracked a few molecular information and demonstrated limited overlapping between fresh fluorescent dom and molecular formula identified from spe dom fig s8a the inconsistent variation of optical and molecular properties might also be related to the chemodiversity enhancement of dom during the storm event which was further supported by the pca analysis fig s9 pc1 exhibited positive loadings relating to aliphatic compounds of spe dom and parafac components of fluorescent dom while negative loadings relating to aromatic dom associated parameters e g aromatic compounds dbe and aimod of spe dom and humification degree of fluorescent dom pc2 exhibited positive loadings relating to fresh dom associated parameters e g bix and fri the positive and negative loadings of pc1 and pc2 separated all samples from each other indicating high composition heterogeneity and chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area during the storm event besides that pca further suggested that environmental factors also affected dom chemistry in non tgr area during the storm event fig s9 specifically sio3 2 po4 3 and din showed positive loading of pc1 and were located in similar positions of parafac components indicating that the nutrient input related closely to the abundances of fluorescent dom during the storm event unlike nutrient status influenced fluorescent dom addition through primary productivity e g algal bloom under normal hydrological conditions yamashita et al 2007 the short water residence time during storm event would limit the linkage between nutrients and primary productivity bargu et al 2019 which indicated that nutrient and fluorescent dom are likely derived from similar sources considering the enrichment of nutrients and terrestrially colored dom in riparian soils heffernan and sponseller 2004 storm event induced soil erosion and runoff reinforcing would significantly influence nutrient and fluorescent dom addition in river systems fellman et al 2008 with the scattered distribution of dom samples from non tgr area in pca land types and ions also affected the dom chemistry at the molecular level fig s9 ca2 k vegetational land and urban land had positive loadings on pc1 demonstrating their potential influences on the composition of fluorescent dom in contrast mg2 na bare land and farmland had negative loadings on pc1 which related closely to the molecular composition and characteristics of spe dom mg2 and na are located at a similar position with m z dbe and pcas hu poly suggesting that the input of mg2 and na are consistent with the enrichment of pcas hu poly with high molecular weight and unsaturation which could also be accounted by the storm event induced contribution enhancement of rock weathering and soil erosion oliva et al 1999 li et al 2011 in addition bare land and farmland are located at a similar position to aimod with negative loadings of pc1 indicating their positive correlation with the aromaticity of spe dom this relationship was further confirmed by the positive spearman correlation between bare land and farmland and individual molecular formulas with high o c and low h c values fig s10 considering aromatic molecules of dom exhibited low h c values koch and dittmar 2006 since bare land and farmland are subjected to severe soil erosion for its limited water and land conservation ouyang et al 2010 as well as the enrichment of aromatic dom formulas masese et al 2017 he et al 2021 storm event induced soil scour would contribute to the association between bare land and farmland and aromaticity of dom in non tgr area in general with comprehensive analyses of environmental factors and dom variations the storm event induced high chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area 4 2 flood control of reservoir reconstrained dom to more similar chemistry in contrast to significant variations of dom chemistry e g bulk optical and molecular levels in non tgr area more homogeneous characteristics of dom in tgr area were observed figs 2 3 s3 s4 increasing trends of doc and tdn and a decreasing trend of δ13c were observed along upstream to downstream transect in non tgr area suggesting the increasing of terrestrial derived doc with storm event induced flood cifuentes and eldridge 1998 the abundances of c1 c2 c3 and c4 c5 also increased from upstream to downstream suggesting humic like and protein like fluorescent components accelerated more downstream than upstream fig 3a b a decreasing trend of the relative abundance of pcas hu poly was observed while ua peptides varied oppositely indicating the spatial dynamic of the molecular composition of dom in non tgr area fig 3c d nevertheless unlike in non tgr area a slight variation of these parameters was observed in tgr area fig 3e h moreover the coefficient of variation comparison of dom parameters among non tgr area and tgr area was conducted uniformly distributed random numbers selection n 5 equivalent to the number of dom samples in tgr area among samples in non tgr area for 1000 times still exhibit higher coefficient of variation of dom parameters e g δ13c c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 mlbl pcas hu poly ua peptides in non tgr area than those in tgr area demonstrating higher chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area than in tgr area fig s7 the variation of dom chemistry between non tgr area and tgr area was also characterized by pca fig 4 the loadings of pc1 and pc2 represented 58 of the variations compared to the scattered distribution of dom samples in non tgr area dom samples in tgr area are centered in a small area indicating more heterogeneous and homogeneous properties of dom in non tgr area and tgr area respectively dom in non tgr area was transported rapidly by flood which lasted for 6 days to tgr area during the storm event it was subject to retention in tgr area under the flood control mode of tgr resulting in a rapid and significant transformation of dom chemistry from non tgr area to tgr area to explore the potential underlying transformation behaviors e g biodegradation and photodegradation of dom stubbins et al 2010 catalán et al 2017 a comparison of molecular formulas constrained from biodegradation and photodegradation incubation experiments 7 days was performed detailed in supplementary materials only a few formulas were identified as biodegradable 4 or photodegradable 10 in the unique molecule pool in non tgr area compared to tgr area fig s11 this indicated that although biodegradation and photodegradation were crucial ways of dom transformation the quick transportation from non tgr area to tgr area induced by the flood might not allow enough time for significant microbial or photochemical degradation saadi et al 2006 hansen et al 2016 moreover a significant correlation between doc and turbidity was observed indicating that turbidity might involve significantly in the dom chemistry from non tgr area to tgr area fig s12a which was further supported by the spearman correlation between turbidity and numerous molecular formulas fig s12b the interaction between dom and particulate organic matter pom has been considered an essential part of biogeochemical processes he et al 2016 lee et al 2021 valiente et al 2022 the adsorption desorption or flocculation of specific compounds could significantly modulate dom composition helms et al 2013 asmala et al 2014 integrated with the significant correlation between dom characteristics and turbidity the turbidity involved dom transformation e g adsorption desorption and flocculation might be a key factor regulating higher chemodiversity of dom in non tgr area to lower chemodiversity in tgr area during the storm event fig s13 therefore a conceptual model was presented to show the response of dom chemistry to flood control of tgr during the extreme storm event fig 5 storm event induced flood resulted in the chemodiversity bloom of dom in non tgr area under high velocity nevertheless the control mode activation of tgr re constrained dom to more similar chemistry under lower velocity through the modulation mainly by turbidity involved dom transformation e g adsorption desorption and flocculation and photodegradation and biodegradation contributed partly to the variation of dom 4 3 biogeochemical implications and limitations characterizing dom property at multiple levels demonstrated the dynamic processes of dom from non tgr area to tgr area during the storm event to assess the dom variation more comprehensively we compared the dom chemistry of this study with other rivers during storm events the molecular comparison of dom among storm event influenced yangtze river and other rivers was further conducted based on h c and o c fig s14 lee et al 2019 wagner et al 2019 wide ranges of h c and o c values were observed in storm influenced river systems also supporting the chemodiversity bloom induced by storm events while reservoir samples flocked together closely indicated the constraint of reservoir flood control to dom chemistry as a crucial component of organic carbon dom is related closely to most carbon transformation processes and the flood control influenced dom dynamic would exert influence on regional carbon cycling hansell and carlson 2001 cram compounds the primary component of refractory marine dom have been estimated to widely persist in inland waters and play a key role in carbon flux among aquatic ecosystems hertkorn et al 2006 lam et al 2007 therefore we used cram as an index for the refractory part of dom despite various factors e g spe efficiency influencing molecular identification molecular flux comparison could still provide non negligible information on carbon cycling kurek et al 2022 during the storm event the discharge flow in tgr is up to 60 000 m3 s combined with the cram content averaged 51 doc concentration averaged 2 0 mg l and spe extraction efficiency 65 the highest cram flux flow in non tgr area was 0 39 105 g c s 1 which was lower than the average values in amazon river 2 99 105 g c s and congo river 1 76 105 g c s kurek et al 2022 table s2 under flood control mode tgr retained flood water of ca 6 3 billion m3 chen et al 2018 combined with the dom property in non tgr area doc 2 0 mg l cram 51 and tgr area doc 2 5 mg l cram 53 we estimated that extra cram of ca 1 2 109 g c was formed in tgr due to the flood control which was resistant to biodegradation and would be drained to recalcitrant doc pool downstream therefore our investigation uncovered that although limiting flood transport and cushioning the shock on riverine ecosystems flood control of reservoirs likely enhanced the transport of recalcitrant doc although we purposely designed and carried out the investigation in this study limitations still exist for instance the sampling sites are set according to topography for logistical and security reasons resulting in limited coverage of the upstream area furthermore for the high velocity of the flood only surface water samples are collected and a vertical sampling including middle and bottom water samples and sediment samples is needed to better clarification of the vertical dynamic of dom from water column to sediment moreover further comprehensive analysis e g fe3 measurement and quantitative evaluation of various factors adsorption desorption photodegradation and biodegradation potentially regulating dom dynamics are still needed nevertheless considering investigation security during the extreme flood this study utilized a valuable field sample set to explore the dom dynamic in the context of flood control of reservoirs our study provides a novel insight into the biogeochemical role of reservoir operation during the flood which would help to better constrain the influence of extreme climate change on riverine carbon cycling and the role of anthropogenic activity e g reservoir operation in tackling extreme climate change 5 conclusion this work carried out a comprehensive investigation of the response of dom chemistry to tgr flood control during an extreme storm event different variations of dom chemistry from bulk optical and molecular levels among non tgr area and tgr area were uncovered increasing trends of doc and tdn concentrations and a decreasing trend of δ13c from upstream to downstream were observed in non tgr area in contrast no significant variation in dom chemistry was observed in tgr area in addition based on optical and molecular information provided by eems and ft icr ms the chemodiversity bloom of dom in non tgr area was observed which might result from the addition of storm event induced organic matter nevertheless flood control of tgr was observed to re constrain dom to more similar chemistry in tgr area mainly through turbidity involved dom transformation e g adsorption desorption and flocculation integrated with the hydrological information we further suggested that flood control of tgr not only influenced the dom chemistry but also enhanced the transport amount of recalcitrant molecular formulas during the extreme storm event with global climate changes extreme storm event induced floods will likely increase widely further highlighting the function of reservoirs in flood control the comprehensive investigation of reservoir influenced dom dynamics during storm events would therefore hint at a new insight into understanding how extreme climate change influenced carbon
