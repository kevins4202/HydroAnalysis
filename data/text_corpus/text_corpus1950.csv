9750,the scarcity of irrigation water has now become the main constraint for crop production globally potato growth in arid and semiarid regions is facing increasing challenges due to water deficit potato productivity is generally influenced by water and fertilizer and the requirements for these factors vary depending on the soil type and potato variety field experiments were conducted during 2019 2020 to select the suitable potato varieties with the best combination of irrigation and fertilization levels the three irrigation amounts were w1 100 crop evapotranspiration etc w2 80 etc and w3 60 etc the three fertilizer rates were f1 n p2o5 k2o 240 120 300 kg ha 1 f2 180 90 225 kg ha 1 and f3 120 60 150 kg ha 1 the three locally cultivated potato varieties were v1 feiurita v2 xiapoti and v3 yushu 4 the results showed that irrigation amount fertilizer amount and potato variety had significant effects on potato growth yield quality and water and fertilizer productivity the average potato yield and irrigation water use efficiency iwue in feiurita were 12 5 11 9 and 14 2 13 3 higher than those in xiapoti in 2019 2020 respectively on average the tuber yield and partial factor productivity pfp in w1 were 27 8 35 and 26 8 34 7 higher than those in w3 in 2019 2020 respectively tuber yield iwue and polyphenol oxidase activity poa were most subject to irrigation amount followed by potato variety and fertilizer rate potato tuber yield was significantly correlated with soil available potassium soil actinomycete quantity soil catalase activity and soil sucrase activity ssa the w2f3v1 treatment had the highest pfp starch content reducing sugar content and vitamin c content vc and the tuber yield and crude protein content were relatively high the w3f2v1 treatment had the highest iwue and vitamin c and the starch content and poa were relatively high among them the soil actinomycete quantity soil cellulose decomposition bacteria quantity scdbq soil catalase activity soil urease activity sua and ssa in the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments were moderate the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments are recommended as the best water and fertilizer management in sandy loam soils in northwest china keywords arid and semi arid region crude protein soil nitrate nitrogen soil available potassium soil bacteria soil urease activity 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is widely grown around the world because of its rich nutrition ease of cultivation and high yield wang et al 2020b it is now the fourth most important food crop in the world after wheat rice and maize covering 19 3 million hectares and producing 388 2 million tons waqas et al 2021 it is now grown in more than 100 countries and feeds more than a billion people worldwide islam et al 2020 potato tubers provide a large amount of dietary carbohydrates and protein most of which are represented by starch 60 80 of dry matter reducing sugars and organic acids whose content is significantly affected by variety soil environment and their interactions romano et al 2018 potato quality varies significantly with variety and growing conditions jama rodzeńska et al 2020 therefore it is a key measure to improve the quality and yield of potato tubers to identify different potato varieties and soil environments and their interaction effects most potato varieties have shallow roots and rarely stretch so they are more subject to water supply than most other crops wagg et al 2021 the potato plant s first response to water deficit is stomatal closure büssis et al 1998 stomatal closure reduces the gas exchange between leaf cells and the environment thus reducing water loss wilkinson and davies 2002 however stomatal closure increases leaf temperature and reduces the diffusion of carbon dioxide into the leaves therefore reducing photosynthesis schapendonk et al 1989 water deficit also reduces water pressure in plant cells miranda et al 2021 without adequate photosynthesis and water pressure the growth and quality of potato tubers will be limited wagg et al 2021 short term water deficit has a negative effect on potato growth and development especially during tuber germination and tuber expansion demirel et al 2020 the effect of water deficit on potato tuber yield depends on stress severity soil nutrient supply and the tolerance of potato varieties grados et al 2020 jacques et al 2020 water deficit in the early stage of potato growth mainly resulted in a decrease in potato leaf area and tuber number while water deficit in the late stage reduced the degree of leaf area reduction but had significant effects on tuber size and quality ávila valdés et al 2020 however another view holds that early stress is the most unfavorable to nodulation and expansion and the decrease in tuber yield is the result of the decrease in the carbon assimilation rate aliche et al 2020 water deficiency causes physiological disorder of potato and a decrease in dry matter and tuber starch content carli et al 2014 potatoes are grown mainly for their tubers the source leaves synthesize carbohydrates through photosynthesis and the final product of photosynthesis is sucrose which is transferred to the stolon and converted to starch which is the key physiological process of potato tuber germination and growth dahal et al 2019 effective coordination among these processes determines the yield and quality of tubers therefore studying the interaction between soil moisture and nutrients is an effective way to reveal the influence of water deficit on potato yield and quality in addition potato is a nitrogen intensive plant with low nitrogen uptake efficiency gitari et al 2018 potato planting under overfertilization conditions in pursuit of high yield has a high potential for n loss jahanzad et al 2017 nutrient growth and yield were not significantly improved when the n application rate was more than 250 kg ha 1 ayyub et al 2019 the high nitrate nitrogen content in the potato root zone caused by excessive fertilization is the main problem faced by farmers abdo et al 2020 the increase in nitrate accumulation in potato tubers caused by excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer will cause many diseases to humans and pose a threat to the health of the whole society jovovic et al 2021 excessive nitrogen and potassium application as well as excessive soil nutrient levels may reduce tuber yield and quality ayyub et al 2019 excessive nitrogen fertilization not only pollutes water systems and the environment but also causes economic loss to farmers when nitrogen is not absorbed by crops ierna and mauromicale 2019 to obtain adequate biomass yield a balanced application of nitrogen is required which leads to a stable yield and the production of good quality tubers koch et al 2020 therefore finding the optimal application rate to reduce nitrate accumulation to acceptable limits is an important issue appropriate soil moisture can promote the absorption and utilization of soil nutrients by potatoes mugo et al 2020 modern production practices include optimizing the use of nitrogen and water to optimize crop production and minimize the risk of leaching nitrogen into groundwater badr et al 2012 water deficiency leads to smaller potato tubers and lower yield but there are significant differences in varieties to cope with water stress ahmadi et al 2014 mattar et al 2021 spring potato cv draga yields were almost twice as high as fall potato cv diamont yields under both irrigation methods and all nitrogen treatments janat 2007 the effects of water and nitrogen fertilizer on potato crop growth have been widely reported yet the results differ this may be due to different crop varieties plant densities soil types and climatic conditions to address water scarcity problems and increase yields coupled field management techniques of water and fertilizer are often recommended for potato planting in the sandy loam soils of northwest china despite the widespread use of irrigation and fertilization in this area few studies have reported the interaction of irrigation amount fertilizer rate and potato variety in china or other regions worldwide in particular the effects of irrigation and fertilization on the growth yield and resource use efficiency of different potato varieties in northwest china have not been investigated the evaluation of soil physical chemical and biological indicators under different irrigation amounts and fertilizer application rates with three main potato varieties is a new method to precisely assess field management on farms principal component analysis pca was used to evaluate and select potato field management methods in this study field experiments were conducted to study the effects of different irrigation rates and nitrogen fertilizer application rates on potato yield and quality in sandy loam soils in northwest china the aim of this paper is to provide a scientific basis for the effective management of irrigation and fertilization of optimal potato varieties 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field trials during the potato growing season were conducted

than that in the w2 and w3 treatments in 2019 respectively and by 12 4 and 31 4 in 2020 respectively table 3 the irrigation amount had a significant effect on the scdbq in 2019 and the fertilizer rate had a significant effect on the scdbq in 2020 table 3 irrigation amount had a significant effect on soil catalase activity sca and fertilizer rate had a significant effect on sca in 2020 table 3 saq was most subject to irrigation amount followed by fertilizer rate and potato variety table s4 the fertilizer rate had a significant effect on sua and ssa in 2019 and 2020 table 3 sua and ssa were most subject to fertilizer rate followed by variety and irrigation amount table s4 averaging across all irrigation amounts and varieties the sua in f1 was 17 and 33 6 lower than that in f2 and f3 in 2019 respectively and by 18 3 and 32 6 in 2020 respectively table 3 averaging across all irrigation amounts and fertilizer rates the sua in feiurita was 12 2 and 10 8 higher than that in yushu 4 in 2019 and 2020 respectively table 3 the similar result was observed in ssa averaging across all irrigation amounts and varieties the ssa in f1 was 24 and 23 6 lower than that in f2 and f3 in 2019 respectively and by 30 7 and 31 1 in 2020 respectively table 3 3 6 correlation analysis and pca there were significant p 0 05 correlations between potato tuber yield and k saq sca and ssa in the bivariate correlation analyses and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 298 to 0 629 fig 5 fig s2 in particular the potato tuber yield was negatively correlated with tss and poa fig 5 iwue was significantly related to swc ph saq and sca and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 278 to 0 614 fig 5 fig s2 iwue was negatively correlated with sec and scdbq fig 5 there were significant p 0

ph r2 0 44 and saq r2 0 51 fig s2 there were highly significant p 0 01 correlations between the rsc and snnc sanc som p k sfq and scdbq in the bivariate correlation analyses and the rsc was most correlated with the scdbq figs s2 s3 cpc was significantly related to sec k saq and ssa and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 296 to 0 569 fig 5 fig s3 vc was significantly related to ph r2 0

tss rsc cpc vc poa and bi in both years it was theoretically possible to consider the standardized values as variables representing fruit quality tables s5 and s10 a correlation matrix was calculated from the standardized values tables s6 and s11 then the total variance explained by cr and acr based on eigenvalues was obtained by pca tables s7 and s12 in this analysis three components were extracted from the matrix of fruit quality parameters tables s8 and s13 three component scores were also extracted from the matrix of fruit quality parameters tables s9 and s14 fig 6 the comprehensive parameter rankings based on the pca are shown in table 4 w2f3v3 and w3f2v1 were ranked first and second in 2019 w3f2v1 and w2f3v3 were ranked first and second in 2020 fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting potato tuber yield iwue and pfp water and fertilizer supply are important factors controlling potato production levels especially in arid and semiarid regions badr et al 2012 this study showed that the amount of irrigation had the greatest effect on potato tuber yield followed by variety and fertilizer rate on average the tuber yield in w1 was 27 8 and 35 higher than that in w3 in 2019 and 2020 respectively successful field management depends on the crop and variety growth period evaporation requirements soil texture and soil nutrient balance wang et al 2019c in sandy soils potato tuber yield is often limited by a lack of water and soil nutrients wang et al 2020b therefore more accurate farmland management techniques are an effective way to increase potato yield in this study it was found that potato tuber yield was most subject to irrigation amount followed by potato variety and fertilizer rate soil moisture is one of the important factors affecting potato yield and quality which is mainly related to the significant effect of irrigation amount on decreasing canopy temperature and increasing potato tuber number yuan et al 2003 in addition the amount of irrigation and fertilizer were the main factors affecting the soil nutrient content microbial community and enzyme activities this study showed that there was a significant correlation between yield and k saq sca and ssa similar results suggest that the positive response of potato tuber yield is due to potassium rather than nitrogen since only tuber potassium concentration and uptake are significantly affected haase et al 2007 the irrigation amount had the greatest effect on potato tuber yield which may be due to the increase in irrigation amount leading to the decrease in saq and sca and the increase in ssa in addition suitable fertilizer application could increase the content of saprophytic fungi and the basal respiration rate and significantly increase the initial soil organic carbon content heinze et al 2011 this study showed that the change in irrigation water amount level had an important effect on potato plant height lai dma and yield except for lai at the germination stage lai and dma at other growth stages were significantly correlated with potato tuber yield the lai dma and potato tuber yield significantly increased with increasing irrigation amount however other studies have shown that irrigation method had no significant effect on potato growth but irrigation mount level has a significant effect on potato tuber yield onder et al 2005 mattar et al 2021 basically the correlation between plant growth and yield and the amount of water received suggested that the more water applied the better the potato crop performed wagg et al 2021 at the same deficit irrigation level the mean tuber yield in feiurita was 12 5 and 11 9 higher than that in xiapoti in 2019 and 2020 respectively considering only potato yield the results of this study can be used to guide the selection of feiurita in areas with insufficient irrigation water however the iwue and pfp are also very important factors fig 8 this study shows that irrigation amount and potato variety have a significant influence on iwue and the iwue was the most subject to irrigation amount followed by potato variety irrigation can increase potato tuber yield and there were genotypic differences in water use in potatoes with differences in maturity and water requirements between traditional and modern potatoes fandika et al 2016 djaman et al 2021 potato tuber yield increased with increasing fertilizer rate under the w1 irrigation level while potato tuber yield increased first and then decreased with increasing fertilizer rate under the w2 and w3 treatments the iwue of potato decreased with increasing irrigation amount and increased with increasing fertilizer rate wang et al 2020b it was found that iwue was most subject to irrigation amount followed by potato variety and fertilizer rate the iwue was significantly related to swc ph sec sfq saq scdbq and sca this result may be related to the increase in iwue by fertilization but the effect gradually decreased with the increase in irrigation amount badr et al 2012 the application of urea and ammonium bicarbonate decreased the nitrogen preference and quick availability of crops but increased the soil ph value wang et al 2020a soil microbial diversity is critical to sustainable agriculture because microbes mediate many of the biochemical processes that support agricultural production sahu et al 2019 rational irrigation and fertilization management has positive effects on the soil microbial community such as improving the functional diversity of the soil microbial community yang et al 2021 it was concluded that improvement in iwue requires consideration of the regulation of the functional diversity of the soil microbial community and soil enzyme activities on average the iwue in feiurita was 14 2 and 13 3 higher than that in xiapoti in 2019 and 2020 respectively feiurita was better adapted to water deficiency than xiapoti at the same fertilization level therefore growers need to understand the growth stages of those potato varieties and the associated daily water use to improve yield and water use efficiency this study showed that pfp was the most subject to the fertilizer application rate followed by the irrigation amount and the variety ranked last in intensive agriculture the pfp is generally regarded as the simplest and most direct indicator of nitrogen use efficiency grzebisz et al 2020 pfp increased with increasing irrigation amount and decreased with increasing fertilizer amount on average the pfp in w1 was 26 8 and 34 7 higher than that in w3 in 2019 and 2020 respectively meanwhile the mean pfp in feiurita was 24 and 15 5 higher than that in xiapoti and yushu 4 respectively there may be two reasons for this phenomenon potato yield increased with the increase of fertilizer application yet the increase rate of potato yield did not match the increase rate in fertilizer application wang et al 2021b conversely high irrigation amounts in sandy loam soil are prone to deep leakage which removes soil nutrients resulting in inadequate absorption of soil nutrients by potatoes wang et al 2021a in this study pfp was most subject to the amount of fertilizer followed by the amount of irrigation and finally the variety under the same fertilization level the pfp of deficit irrigation treatment increased with increasing irrigation frequency wang et al 2019a similar results showed that pfp first increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation amount wang et al 2020b in addition different potato varieties have different nutrient metabolism which is related to fertilizer use efficiency anas et al 2020 in future studies the gene network related to nitrogen uptake transportation utilization mobilization and storage in different potato varieties will be an effective way to improve pfp 4 2 factors affecting potato tuber quality in recent years with the improvement in people s living standards potato tuber quality has become a necessary index to evaluate field management sha et al 2021 the higher the starch content of potato tuber is the better the quality of the potato processing industry especially large scale potato chip production ayyub et al 2019 potato sc was significantly affected by irrigation amount fertilizer rate and varieties on average sc decreased with increasing irrigation amount and fertilizer application rate this study showed that sc was most subject to the irrigation amount followed by the fertilizer application rate and finally the variety this study showed that the sc in f1 was 12 1 and 18 7 lower than that in f2 and f3 in 2020 respectively this holds particularly true for element n because potato cultivation bears high risks of n leaching due to its high demand for readily available n in soil and the small root system of the crop bachmann pfabe and dehmer 2020 tuber yield sc and vc contents increased with increasing irrigation frequency but increased with increasing irrigation amount wang et al 2011 ávila valdés et al 2020 reported that the tuber yield of the native genotype was higher and the contents of protein starch and phenol were higher this phenomenon may be related to the influence of irrigation and fertilization on soil physical and chemical properties and biological characteristics the results indicated that sc was significantly related to swc ph saq scdbq and ssa in particular the determination coefficient of potato sc and saq reached 0 67 it was speculated that a new way to improve potato sc is to regulate the soil microbial community in addition the general response to hydrothermal stress also appears to be highly genotypic dependent and suitable future varieties must have a higher tuber growth rate during tuber filling to compensate for the accelerated crop senescence caused by water scarcity banik et al 2016 this study showed that irrigation amount had a significant effect on tss and tss decreased with increasing irrigation amount tss was most subject to irrigation amount followed by fertilizer rate and finally variety this phenomenon may be due to tss contributing to osmotic adjustment during ongoing stress rudack et al 2017 under mild and long term drought stress as in this study tss accumulation was not associated with the drought tolerance of different potato varieties similar results showed that irrigation amount had a significant effect on the tss content of potato tubers ávila valdés et al 2020 in this study tss was most subject to irrigation amount followed by fertilizer rate and finally variety this phenomenon was related to irrigation and fertilization regulating soil ph and microbial biomass in the potato root zone van dingenen et al 2019 reported that nitrogen restriction had no significant effect on tuber yield and starch content but significantly reduced tuber sugar content our results indicated that tss was significantly related to ph r2 0 44 and saq r2 0 51 this may be determined by the role of soil actinomycetes which can degrade various insoluble organic substances in the soil to obtain various nutrients needed for cell metabolism and play an important role in the mineralization of organic matter and soil improvement bhatti et al 2017 lipczynska kochany 2018 excessive fertilizer application reduced the maturity of potato tubers thus affecting the accumulation of tss and sugar at harvest zhang et al 2020 in this study the rsc was most subject to the fertilizer rate followed by the variety and irrigation amount the greater the amount of positive alleles in the genotype the lower the rsc is which was related to potato variety xiao et al 2018 wang et al 2019b fertilization had a synergistic effect on regulating rs content and starch accumulation and transformation in potato tubers furrer et al 2018 the increase in the fertilizer application rate resulted in a decrease in the crude protein of most amino acids such as lysine threonine methionine and tryptophan eppendorfer et al 1979 similar results showed that the rsc decreased with increasing fertilizer application under deficient irrigation wang et al 2021a under the same fertilization level the decrease in rsc decreased with increasing irrigation amount the changing trend of reducing sugar was opposite to that of starch which might be due to the influence of irrigation and fertilization on the conversion of sugar to starch wang et al 2019a this is consistent with the findings of this study that rsc was significantly related to snnc sanc som p k sfq and scdbq soil microorganisms play numerous roles in soil fertility by decomposing and mineralizing organic carbon components and recycling essential plant nutrients haddad et al 2019 in this study the rsc was most correlated with the scdbq and the correlation coefficient was 0 72 potato protein is an important source of essential amino acids for plants and its composition is similar to that of egg protein wichrowska and szczepanek 2020 it was also found that potato yield was negatively correlated with tss and positively correlated with cpc cpc was most subject to variety followed by irrigation amount and fertilizer rate this may be related to the amount of fertilizer applied with a maximum nitrogen application rate of 240 kg ha 1 that had little effect on cpc on the other hand inorganic fertilizer had little effect on the crude protein content of potato tubers some studies showed that the contents of tyrosine methionine and asparagine in potato tuber protein were significantly increased by applying biological fertilizer and organic fertilizer wen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 on average the cpc in feiurita was 36 8 higher than that in xiapoti similar results showed that the protein content was determined by the inherent genetic characteristics of each variety the variety had certain adaptability to the region and the ecological conditions had no significant effect on the protein content arvanitoyannis et al 2008 ngobese et al 2017 the processing of high protein tubers has high economic value and has important economic significance for the potato starch industry dourado et al 2019 genetic loci are an important factor affecting soluble protein content in potato tubers xing et al 2020 the results showed that cpc was most subject to variety followed by irrigation amount and fertilizer rate similar results showed that there were significant differences in potato quality parameters among different potato varieties zhou et al 2019 it was found that cpc was significantly related to sec k saq and ssa sec is an index to measure soil water soluble salts which is an important property of soil and a factor to judge whether salt ions in soil limit crop growth barman et al 2021 lei et al 2021 it can be inferred that cpc is related to soil salt concentration and the regulation mechanism of soil salt concentration on cpc should be further studied in the future in addition the soil k concentration was also an important soil nutrient factor affecting potato tuber cpc finally saq and ssa were the main factors affecting potato tuber cpc this can be caused by soil sucrase promoting the transformation of some soil substances in the root range which is beneficial to the absorption and utilization of rhizosphere microorganisms wei et al 2020 in the future researchers need to pay more attention to the effects of the soil microbial community and soil enzymes on potato tuber quality the vc content in potato tuber is an important index of tuber quality and mainly exists in oxidized form and reduced form yadav et al 2017 in this study the potato tuber vc content was most subject to variety followed by fertilizer rate and irrigation amount the vc in yushu 4 was 21 5 and 20 3 higher than that in feiurita and xiapoti respectively the variation in vc content in potato tuber may be related to the genetic potential of the genotype li et al 2020 the variation in vc content in potato varieties may be related to the inherent ability of potato genotypes to produce vitamins kadaja and saue 2016 polyphenol oxidase has been widely detected in most fruits and vegetables and the leading factor in inducing enzymatic browning catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds to melanin queiroz et al 2008 in potatoes browning is associated with black spots formed during storage from internally damaged and or peeling tubers jun et al 2019 reducing the water supply can significantly increase and decrease sc and vc carli et al 2014 the results showed that vc was most subject to variety followed by fertilizer rate and irrigation amount the content of vc in potato tuber is most closely related to the genetic characteristics of potato soil ph and sec had the most significant effect on vc content therefore to improve the content of vc in potato tubers it is a better choice to select potato varieties with higher vc contents in this study the amount of irrigation had a significant effect on poa but potato variety and fertilizer amount had no significant effect on poa this may be due to changes in poa related to salinity heavy metal exposure drought and heat stress kim et al 2014 the results of this study show that poa was most subject to irrigation amount followed by variety and fertilizer rate the reaction of free amino acids with the carbonyl end of polysaccharides produces schiff bases at the early stage of the maillard reaction and at the advanced stage of the reaction some of the intermediate products might undergo polymerization to form brown pigments this browning intensity has often been used as an index of the extent of the maillard reaction arogundade et al 2021 in addition this study showed that bi was most subject to variety followed by irrigation amount and fertilizer rate similar studies showed that there were significant differences in browning intensity and polyphenol oxidase activity among potato varieties cabezas serrano et al 2009 xing et al 2020 bøjer rasmussen et al 2021 4 3 evaluate and select the best field management high yield is the goal of farmers high quality is the requirement of consumers and iwue and pfp are the core components of the efficient utilization of agricultural water and fertilizer resources in practice it is difficult to maximize yield quality iwue and pfp at the same time in this study the pca method was used to evaluate the potato tuber yield quality iwue and pfp of the nine treatments this method can provide an effective solution for the optimization of different traits and comprehensive evaluation of target populations wang et al 2020b many researchers suggest the use of pca for data analysis when selecting the optimal combination of parameters in various fields jain et al 2007 zebarth et al 2019 quan et al 2021 pca was used to screen out the best genotypes and environmental factors suitable for yield stability and bacterial wilt resistance of potato tuber in kenya muthoni et al 2015 pca of this study showed that w2f3v1 irrigation amount 80 etc fertilizer rate n p2o5 k2o 120 60 150 kg ha 1 potato variety feiurita ranked first and w3f2v1 irrigation amount 60 etc fertilizer rate n p2o5 k2o 180 90 225 kg ha 1 potato variety feiurita ranked second in 2019 in 2020 w3f2v1 ranked first and w2f3v1 ranked second the w2f3v1 treatment had the highest pfp sc rsc and vc and the tuber yield and cpc were relatively high the w3f2v1 treatment had the highest iwue and vc and the sc and poa were relatively high among them the saq scdbq sca sua and ssa in the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments were moderate therefore the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments are recommended as the best water and fertilizer management in sandy soil the purpose of this study was to select the best field management measures and explore the importance of irrigation amount and fertilizer amount in regulating potato tuber quality and water and fertilizer use efficiency 5 conclusion increasing the activities of soil available potassium soil actinomycetes soil catalase and sucrase was an effective measure to improve potato yield iwue can be improved by increasing soil ph soil actinomycete quantity and soil catalase activity and decreasing soil electrical conductivity and scdbq the pca results showed that the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments are recommended as the best water and fertilizer management in sandy soil this method clarified the contribution and impact of these measures and provided a basis for evaluating and selecting better potato planting management measures the results are of great significance for strengthening the

9750,the scarcity of irrigation water has now become the main constraint for crop production globally potato growth in arid and semiarid regions is facing increasing challenges due to water deficit potato productivity is generally influenced by water and fertilizer and the requirements for these factors vary depending on the soil type and potato variety field experiments were conducted during 2019 2020 to select the suitable potato varieties with the best combination of irrigation and fertilization levels the three irrigation amounts were w1 100 crop evapotranspiration etc w2 80 etc and w3 60 etc the three fertilizer rates were f1 n p2o5 k2o 240 120 300 kg ha 1 f2 180 90 225 kg ha 1 and f3 120 60 150 kg ha 1 the three locally cultivated potato varieties were v1 feiurita v2 xiapoti and v3 yushu 4 the results showed that irrigation amount fertilizer amount and potato variety had significant effects on potato growth yield quality and water and fertilizer productivity the average potato yield and irrigation water use efficiency iwue in feiurita were 12 5 11 9 and 14 2 13 3 higher than those in xiapoti in 2019 2020 respectively on average the tuber yield and partial factor productivity pfp in w1 were 27 8 35 and 26 8 34 7 higher than those in w3 in 2019 2020 respectively tuber yield iwue and polyphenol oxidase activity poa were most subject to irrigation amount followed by potato variety and fertilizer rate potato tuber yield was significantly correlated with soil available potassium soil actinomycete quantity soil catalase activity and soil sucrase activity ssa the w2f3v1 treatment had the highest pfp starch content reducing sugar content and vitamin c content vc and the tuber yield and crude protein content were relatively high the w3f2v1 treatment had the highest iwue and vitamin c and the starch content and poa were relatively high among them the soil actinomycete quantity soil cellulose decomposition bacteria quantity scdbq soil catalase activity soil urease activity sua and ssa in the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments were moderate the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments are recommended as the best water and fertilizer management in sandy loam soils in northwest china keywords arid and semi arid region crude protein soil nitrate nitrogen soil available potassium soil bacteria soil urease activity 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is widely grown around the world because of its rich nutrition ease of cultivation and high yield wang et al 2020b it is now the fourth most important food crop in the world after wheat rice and maize covering 19 3 million hectares and producing 388 2 million tons waqas et al 2021 it is now grown in more than 100 countries and feeds more than a billion people worldwide islam et al 2020 potato tubers provide a large amount of dietary carbohydrates and protein most of which are represented by starch 60 80 of dry matter reducing sugars and organic acids whose content is significantly affected by variety soil environment and their interactions romano et al 2018 potato quality varies significantly with variety and growing conditions jama rodzeńska et al 2020 therefore it is a key measure to improve the quality and yield of potato tubers to identify different potato varieties and soil environments and their interaction effects most potato varieties have shallow roots and rarely stretch so they are more subject to water supply than most other crops wagg et al 2021 the potato plant s first response to water deficit is stomatal closure büssis et al 1998 stomatal closure reduces the gas exchange between leaf cells and the environment thus reducing water loss wilkinson and davies 2002 however stomatal closure increases leaf temperature and reduces the diffusion of carbon dioxide into the leaves therefore reducing photosynthesis schapendonk et al 1989 water deficit also reduces water pressure in plant cells miranda et al 2021 without adequate photosynthesis and water pressure the growth and quality of potato tubers will be limited wagg et al 2021 short term water deficit has a negative effect on potato growth and development especially during tuber germination and tuber expansion demirel et al 2020 the effect of water deficit on potato tuber yield depends on stress severity soil nutrient supply and the tolerance of potato varieties grados et al 2020 jacques et al 2020 water deficit in the early stage of potato growth mainly resulted in a decrease in potato leaf area and tuber number while water deficit in the late stage reduced the degree of leaf area reduction but had significant effects on tuber size and quality ávila valdés et al 2020 however another view holds that early stress is the most unfavorable to nodulation and expansion and the decrease in tuber yield is the result of the decrease in the carbon assimilation rate aliche et al 2020 water deficiency causes physiological disorder of potato and a decrease in dry matter and tuber starch content carli et al 2014 potatoes are grown mainly for their tubers the source leaves synthesize carbohydrates through photosynthesis and the final product of photosynthesis is sucrose which is transferred to the stolon and converted to starch which is the key physiological process of potato tuber germination and growth dahal et al 2019 effective coordination among these processes determines the yield and quality of tubers therefore studying the interaction between soil moisture and nutrients is an effective way to reveal the influence of water deficit on potato yield and quality in addition potato is a nitrogen intensive plant with low nitrogen uptake efficiency gitari et al 2018 potato planting under overfertilization conditions in pursuit of high yield has a high potential for n loss jahanzad et al 2017 nutrient growth and yield were not significantly improved when the n application rate was more than 250 kg ha 1 ayyub et al 2019 the high nitrate nitrogen content in the potato root zone caused by excessive fertilization is the main problem faced by farmers abdo et al 2020 the increase in nitrate accumulation in potato tubers caused by excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer will cause many diseases to humans and pose a threat to the health of the whole society jovovic et al 2021 excessive nitrogen and potassium application as well as excessive soil nutrient levels may reduce tuber yield and quality ayyub et al 2019 excessive nitrogen fertilization not only pollutes water systems and the environment but also causes economic loss to farmers when nitrogen is not absorbed by crops ierna and mauromicale 2019 to obtain adequate biomass yield a balanced application of nitrogen is required which leads to a stable yield and the production of good quality tubers koch et al 2020 therefore finding the optimal application rate to reduce nitrate accumulation to acceptable limits is an important issue appropriate soil moisture can promote the absorption and utilization of soil nutrients by potatoes mugo et al 2020 modern production practices include optimizing the use of nitrogen and water to optimize crop production and minimize the risk of leaching nitrogen into groundwater badr et al 2012 water deficiency leads to smaller potato tubers and lower yield but there are significant differences in varieties to cope with water stress ahmadi et al 2014 mattar et al 2021 spring potato cv draga yields were almost twice as high as fall potato cv diamont yields under both irrigation methods and all nitrogen treatments janat 2007 the effects of water and nitrogen fertilizer on potato crop growth have been widely reported yet the results differ this may be due to different crop varieties plant densities soil types and climatic conditions to address water scarcity problems and increase yields coupled field management techniques of water and fertilizer are often recommended for potato planting in the sandy loam soils of northwest china despite the widespread use of irrigation and fertilization in this area few studies have reported the interaction of irrigation amount fertilizer rate and potato variety in china or other regions worldwide in particular the effects of irrigation and fertilization on the growth yield and resource use efficiency of different potato varieties in northwest china have not been investigated the evaluation of soil physical chemical and biological indicators under different irrigation amounts and fertilizer application rates with three main potato varieties is a new method to precisely assess field management on farms principal component analysis pca was used to evaluate and select potato field management methods in this study field experiments were conducted to study the effects of different irrigation rates and nitrogen fertilizer application rates on potato yield and quality in sandy loam soils in northwest china the aim of this paper is to provide a scientific basis for the effective management of irrigation and fertilization of optimal potato varieties 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field trials during the potato growing season were conducted in 2019 and 2020 in the modern agricultural science and technology demonstration park of yulin of shaanxi province n38 23 e109 43 china the region experiences a temperate arid and semiarid continental monsoon climate it is 1050 m above sea level and has an average annual precipitation of 411 mm the groundwater depth was below 15 m the annual temperature was 8 5 and the frost free period was 168 days during each growing period a rainfall recorder wi92859 beijing east west instrument technology co ltd was used to measure the precipitation at each rainfall event site and calculate the annual precipitation the total precipitation in 2019 and 2020 was 362 mm and 429 mm respectively fig s1 but the distribution of these two years was quite different the total precipitation of the potato growing seasons in 2019 and 2020 was 298 mm and 341 mm respectively the soil at the test site was sandy loam limestone formation according to the usda soil classification system and the soil at the experimental site was sandy loam generated from limestone wang et al 2020b before the implementation of the test the soil bulk density of cultivated soil 0 60 cm was 1 42 g cm 3 field water capacity was 20 7 soil ph value was 8 3 1 5 soil water soil ammonium nitrogen content was 4 77 mg kg 1 soil nitrate nitrogen content was 9 51 mg kg 1 soil available phosphorus content was 5 73 mg kg 1 and soil available potassium content was 37 27 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design the experimental design applied nine treatments the experiment was arranged as a three factor irrigation fertilization variety orthogonal design with three levels the three irrigation levels were w1 100 the crop evapotranspiration etc w2 80 etc and w3 60 etc the three fertilizer rates were f1 n p2o5 k2o 240 120 300 kg ha 1 f2 180 90 225 kg ha 1 and f3 120 60 150 kg ha 1 the three locally cultivated potato varieties were v1 feiurita v2 xiapoti and v3 yushu 4 the nine treatments were w1f1v1 w1f2v2 w1f3v3 w2f1v2 w2f2v3 w2f3v1

m2 the experiments were conducted during two potato growing seasons in 2019 and 2020 the potato was sown on 15 may in 2019 and 11 may in 2020 the potato growth period was 128 days in 2019 the harvest date was 20 september and 124 days in 2020 the harvest date was 12 september the planting method was mechanical ridging the local traditional row planting method single row layout row spacing of 90 cm

affecting potato tuber yield iwue and pfp water and fertilizer supply are important factors controlling potato production levels especially in arid and semiarid regions badr et al 2012 this study showed that the amount of irrigation had the greatest effect on potato tuber yield followed by variety and fertilizer rate on average the tuber yield in w1 was 27 8 and 35 higher than that in w3 in 2019 and 2020 respectively successful field management depends on the crop and variety growth period evaporation requirements soil texture and soil nutrient balance wang et al 2019c in sandy soils potato tuber yield is often limited by a lack of water and soil nutrients wang et al 2020b therefore more accurate farmland management techniques are an effective way to increase potato yield in this study it was found that potato tuber yield was most subject to irrigation amount followed by potato variety and fertilizer rate soil moisture is one of the important factors affecting potato yield and quality which is mainly related to the significant effect of irrigation amount on decreasing canopy temperature and increasing potato tuber number yuan et al 2003 in addition the amount of irrigation and fertilizer were the main factors affecting the soil nutrient content microbial community and enzyme activities this study showed that there was a significant correlation between yield and k saq sca and ssa similar results suggest that the positive response of potato tuber yield is due to potassium rather than nitrogen since only tuber potassium concentration and uptake are significantly affected haase et al 2007 the irrigation amount had the greatest effect on potato tuber yield which may be due to the increase in irrigation amount leading to the decrease in saq and sca and the increase in ssa in addition suitable fertilizer application could increase the content of saprophytic fungi and the basal respiration rate and significantly increase the initial soil organic carbon content heinze et al 2011 this study showed that the change in irrigation water amount level had an important effect on potato plant height lai dma and yield except for lai at the germination stage lai and dma at other growth stages were significantly correlated with potato tuber yield the lai dma and potato tuber yield significantly increased with increasing irrigation amount however other studies have shown that irrigation method had no significant effect on potato growth but irrigation mount level has a significant effect on potato tuber yield onder et al 2005 mattar et al 2021 basically the correlation between plant growth and yield and the amount of water received suggested that the more water applied the better the potato crop performed wagg et al 2021 at the same deficit irrigation level the mean tuber yield in feiurita was 12 5 and 11 9 higher than that in xiapoti in 2019 and 2020 respectively considering only potato yield the results of this study can be used to guide the selection of feiurita in areas with insufficient irrigation water however the iwue and pfp are also very important factors fig 8 this study shows that irrigation amount and potato variety have a significant influence on iwue and the iwue was the most subject to irrigation amount followed by potato variety irrigation can increase potato tuber yield and there were genotypic differences in water use in potatoes with differences in maturity and water requirements between traditional and modern potatoes fandika et al 2016 djaman et al 2021 potato tuber yield increased with increasing fertilizer rate under the w1 irrigation level while potato tuber yield increased first and then decreased with increasing fertilizer rate under the w2 and w3 treatments the iwue of potato decreased with increasing irrigation amount and increased with increasing fertilizer rate wang et al 2020b it was found that iwue was most subject to irrigation amount followed by potato variety and fertilizer rate the iwue was significantly related to swc ph sec sfq saq scdbq and sca this result may be related to the increase in iwue by fertilization but the effect gradually decreased with the increase in irrigation amount badr et al 2012 the application of urea and ammonium bicarbonate decreased the nitrogen preference and quick availability of crops but increased the soil ph value wang et al 2020a soil microbial diversity is critical to sustainable agriculture because microbes mediate many of the biochemical processes that support agricultural production sahu et al 2019 rational irrigation and fertilization management has positive effects on the soil microbial community such as improving the functional diversity of the soil microbial community yang et al 2021 it was concluded that improvement in iwue requires consideration of the regulation of the functional diversity of the soil microbial community and soil enzyme activities on average the iwue in feiurita was 14 2 and 13 3 higher than that in xiapoti in 2019 and 2020 respectively feiurita was better adapted to water deficiency than xiapoti at the same fertilization level therefore growers need to understand the growth stages of those potato varieties and the associated daily water use to improve yield and water use efficiency this study showed that pfp was the most subject to the fertilizer application rate followed by the irrigation amount and the variety ranked last in intensive agriculture the pfp is generally regarded as the simplest and most direct indicator of nitrogen use efficiency grzebisz et al 2020 pfp increased with increasing irrigation amount and decreased with increasing fertilizer amount on average the pfp in w1 was 26 8 and 34 7 higher than that in w3 in 2019 and 2020 respectively meanwhile the mean pfp in feiurita was 24 and 15 5 higher than that in xiapoti and yushu 4 respectively there may be two reasons for this phenomenon potato yield increased with the increase of fertilizer application yet the increase rate of potato yield did not match the increase rate in fertilizer application wang et al 2021b conversely high irrigation amounts in sandy loam soil are prone to deep leakage which removes soil nutrients resulting in inadequate absorption of soil nutrients by potatoes wang et al 2021a in this study pfp was most subject to the amount of fertilizer followed by the amount of irrigation and finally the variety under the same fertilization level the pfp of deficit irrigation treatment increased with increasing irrigation frequency wang et al 2019a similar results showed that pfp first increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation amount wang et al 2020b in addition different potato varieties have different nutrient metabolism which is related to fertilizer use efficiency anas et al 2020 in future studies the gene network related to nitrogen uptake transportation utilization mobilization and storage in different potato varieties will be an effective way to improve pfp 4 2 factors affecting potato tuber quality in recent years with the improvement in people s living standards potato tuber quality has become a necessary index to evaluate field management sha et al 2021 the higher the starch content of potato tuber is the better the quality of the potato processing industry especially large scale potato chip production ayyub et al 2019 potato sc was significantly affected by irrigation amount fertilizer rate and varieties on average sc decreased with increasing irrigation amount and fertilizer application rate this study showed that sc was most subject to the irrigation amount followed by the fertilizer application rate and finally the variety this study showed that the sc in f1 was 12 1 and 18 7 lower than that in f2 and f3 in 2020 respectively this holds particularly true for element n because potato cultivation bears high risks of n leaching due to its high demand for readily available n in soil and the small root system of the crop bachmann pfabe and dehmer 2020 tuber yield sc and vc contents increased with increasing irrigation frequency but increased with increasing irrigation amount wang et al 2011 ávila valdés et al 2020 reported that the tuber yield of the native genotype was higher and the contents of protein starch and phenol were higher this phenomenon may be related to the influence of irrigation and fertilization on soil physical and chemical properties and biological characteristics the results indicated that sc was significantly related to swc ph saq scdbq and ssa in particular the determination coefficient of potato sc and saq reached 0 67 it was speculated that a new way to improve potato sc is to regulate the soil microbial community in addition the general response to hydrothermal stress also appears to be highly genotypic dependent and suitable future varieties must have a higher tuber growth rate during tuber filling to compensate for the accelerated crop senescence caused by water scarcity banik et al 2016 this study showed that irrigation amount had a significant effect on tss and tss decreased with increasing irrigation amount tss was most subject to irrigation amount followed by fertilizer rate and finally variety this phenomenon may be due to tss contributing to osmotic adjustment during ongoing stress rudack et al 2017 under mild and long term drought stress as in this study tss accumulation was not associated with the drought tolerance of different potato varieties similar results showed that irrigation amount had a significant effect on the tss content of potato tubers ávila valdés et al 2020 in this study tss was most subject to irrigation amount followed by fertilizer rate and finally variety this phenomenon was related to irrigation and fertilization regulating soil ph and microbial biomass in the potato root zone van dingenen et al 2019 reported that nitrogen restriction had no significant effect on tuber yield and starch content but significantly reduced tuber sugar content our results indicated that tss was significantly related to ph r2 0 44 and saq r2 0 51 this may be determined by the role of soil actinomycetes which can degrade various insoluble organic substances in the soil to obtain various nutrients needed for cell metabolism and play an important role in the mineralization of organic matter and soil improvement bhatti et al 2017 lipczynska kochany 2018 excessive fertilizer application reduced the maturity of potato tubers thus affecting the accumulation of tss and sugar at harvest zhang et al 2020 in this study the rsc was most subject to the fertilizer rate followed by the variety and irrigation amount the greater the amount of positive alleles in the genotype the lower the rsc is which was related to potato variety xiao et al 2018 wang et al 2019b fertilization had a synergistic effect on regulating rs content and starch accumulation and transformation in potato tubers furrer et al 2018 the increase in the fertilizer application rate resulted in a decrease in the crude protein of most amino acids such as lysine threonine methionine and tryptophan eppendorfer et al 1979 similar results showed that the rsc decreased with increasing fertilizer application under deficient irrigation wang et al 2021a under the same fertilization level the decrease in rsc decreased with increasing irrigation amount the changing trend of reducing sugar was opposite to that of starch which might be due to the influence of irrigation and fertilization on the conversion of sugar to starch wang et al 2019a this is consistent with the findings of this study that rsc was significantly related to snnc sanc som p k sfq and scdbq soil microorganisms play numerous roles in soil fertility by decomposing and mineralizing organic carbon components and recycling essential plant nutrients haddad et al 2019 in this study the rsc was most correlated with the scdbq and the correlation coefficient was 0 72 potato protein is an important source of essential amino acids for plants and its composition is similar to that of egg protein wichrowska and szczepanek 2020 it was also found that potato yield was negatively correlated with tss and positively correlated with cpc cpc was most subject to variety followed by irrigation amount and fertilizer rate this may be related to the amount of fertilizer applied with a maximum nitrogen application rate of 240 kg ha 1 that had little effect on cpc on the other hand inorganic fertilizer had little effect on the crude protein content of potato tubers some studies showed that the contents of tyrosine methionine and asparagine in potato tuber protein were significantly increased by applying biological fertilizer and organic fertilizer wen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 on average the cpc in feiurita was 36 8 higher than that in xiapoti similar results showed that the protein content was determined by the inherent genetic characteristics of each variety the variety had certain adaptability to the region and the ecological conditions had no significant effect on the protein content arvanitoyannis et al 2008 ngobese et al 2017 the processing of high protein tubers has high economic value and has important economic significance for the potato starch industry dourado et al 2019 genetic loci are an important factor affecting soluble protein content in potato tubers xing et al 2020 the results showed that cpc was most subject to variety followed by irrigation amount and fertilizer rate similar results showed that there were significant differences in potato quality parameters among different potato varieties zhou et al 2019 it was found that cpc was significantly related to sec k saq and ssa sec is an index to measure soil water soluble salts which is an important property of soil and a factor to judge whether salt ions in soil limit crop growth barman et al 2021 lei et al 2021 it can be inferred that cpc is related to soil salt concentration and the regulation mechanism of soil salt concentration on cpc should be further studied in the future in addition the soil k concentration was also an important soil nutrient factor affecting potato tuber cpc finally saq and ssa were the main factors affecting potato tuber cpc this can be caused by soil sucrase promoting the transformation of some soil substances in the root range which is beneficial to the absorption and utilization of rhizosphere microorganisms wei et al 2020 in the future researchers need to pay more attention to the effects of the soil microbial community and soil enzymes on potato tuber quality the vc content in potato tuber is an important index of tuber quality and mainly exists in oxidized form and reduced form yadav et al 2017 in this study the potato tuber vc content was most subject to variety followed by fertilizer rate and irrigation amount the vc in yushu 4 was 21 5 and 20 3 higher than that in feiurita and xiapoti respectively the variation in vc content in potato tuber may be related to the genetic potential of the genotype li et al 2020 the variation in vc content in potato varieties may be related to the inherent ability of potato genotypes to produce vitamins kadaja and saue 2016 polyphenol oxidase has been widely detected in most fruits and vegetables and the leading factor in inducing enzymatic browning catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds to melanin queiroz et al 2008 in potatoes browning is associated with black spots formed during storage from internally damaged and or peeling tubers jun et al 2019 reducing the water supply can significantly increase and decrease sc and vc carli et al 2014 the results showed that vc was most subject to variety followed by fertilizer rate and irrigation amount the content of vc in potato tuber is most closely related to the genetic characteristics of potato soil ph and sec had the most significant effect on vc content therefore to improve the content of vc in potato tubers it is a better choice to select potato varieties with higher vc contents in this study the amount of irrigation had a significant effect on poa but potato variety and fertilizer amount had no significant effect on poa this may be due to changes in poa related to salinity heavy metal exposure drought and heat stress kim et al 2014 the results of this study show that poa was most subject to irrigation amount followed by variety and fertilizer rate the reaction of free amino acids with the carbonyl end of polysaccharides produces schiff bases at the early stage of the maillard reaction and at the advanced stage of the reaction some of the intermediate products might undergo polymerization to form brown pigments this browning intensity has often been used as an index of the extent of the maillard reaction arogundade et al 2021 in addition this study showed that bi was most subject to variety followed by irrigation amount and fertilizer rate similar studies showed that there were significant differences in browning intensity and polyphenol oxidase activity among potato varieties cabezas serrano et al 2009 xing et al 2020 bøjer rasmussen et al 2021 4 3 evaluate and select the best field management high yield is the goal of farmers high quality is the requirement of consumers and iwue and pfp are the core components of the efficient utilization of agricultural water and fertilizer resources in practice it is difficult to maximize yield quality iwue and pfp at the same time in this study the pca method was used to evaluate the potato tuber yield quality iwue and pfp of the nine treatments this method can provide an effective solution for the optimization of different traits and comprehensive evaluation of target populations wang et al 2020b many researchers suggest the use of pca for data analysis when selecting the optimal combination of parameters in various fields jain et al 2007 zebarth et al 2019 quan et al 2021 pca was used to screen out the best genotypes and environmental factors suitable for yield stability and bacterial wilt resistance of potato tuber in kenya muthoni et al 2015 pca of this study showed that w2f3v1 irrigation amount 80 etc fertilizer rate n p2o5 k2o 120 60 150 kg ha 1 potato variety feiurita ranked first and w3f2v1 irrigation amount 60 etc fertilizer rate n p2o5 k2o 180 90 225 kg ha 1 potato variety feiurita ranked second in 2019 in 2020 w3f2v1 ranked first and w2f3v1 ranked second the w2f3v1 treatment had the highest pfp sc rsc and vc and the tuber yield and cpc were relatively high the w3f2v1 treatment had the highest iwue and vc and the sc and poa were relatively high among them the saq scdbq sca sua and ssa in the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments were moderate therefore the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments are recommended as the best water and fertilizer management in sandy soil the purpose of this study was to select the best field management measures and explore the importance of irrigation amount and fertilizer amount in regulating potato tuber quality and water and fertilizer use efficiency 5 conclusion increasing the activities of soil available potassium soil actinomycetes soil catalase and sucrase was an effective measure to improve potato yield iwue can be improved by increasing soil ph soil actinomycete quantity and soil catalase activity and decreasing soil electrical conductivity and scdbq the pca results showed that the w2f3v1 and w3f2v1 treatments are recommended as the best water and fertilizer management in sandy soil this method clarified the contribution and impact of these measures and provided a basis for evaluating and selecting better potato planting management measures the results are of great significance for strengthening the

9751,film mulching and nitrogen fertilization are two effective practices to promote maize production in northwest china but their impacts on environment in terms of greenhouse gas emission remain unclear two year field trials were conducted to 1 explore the effect of the film mulching pattern and n fertilization rate on maize production gaseous n emission and utilization of n and water 2 find an optimal mulching pattern and n fertilization rate to achieve green development trial ⅰ included flat planting with non mulching nm ridge furrow with plastic film mulch pm ridge furrow with biodegradable film mulch bm and flat planting with full plastic film mulching fm trial ⅱ involved bm with n fertilization rates 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 denoted as bmn0 bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively the results showed that film mulching significantly decreased the daily flux and cumulative flux of gaseous n by an average of 32 02 35 17 nh3 78 70 75 83 n2o respectively as compared with nm film mulching also significantly increased the amount of soil residual mineral n after harvest plant n uptake and soil water storage but decreased evapotranspiration by an average of 8 31 9 42 17 45 and 25 34 respectively as compared with nm in addition grain yield water use efficiency wue n uptake efficiency upe except for bm n harvest index nhi n use efficiency nue and partial productivity of n pnp were significantly higher in the mulching treatments and yield scaled nh3 emission ysn was significantly lower in pm and bm as compared with nm compared with fm soil residual mineral n after harvest plant n uptake grain yield wue nue and pnp were significantly lower but nhi was significantly higher in pm and bm the daily ﬂux and cumulative flux of n2o emission and the amount of soil residual no3 n after harvest were significantly lower but plant n uptake was significantly higher in pm than in bm collectively bm was the best mulching treatment in this study with increase of n fertilization rate the daily flux and cumulative flux of nh3 volatilization the peak period and the cumulative flux of n2o emission the grain yield wue nue except for n3 and ysn were significantly increased but nhi pnp and upe were significantly decreased the optimum n fertilization rate under bm was found at 173 kg ha 1 which could achieve the goal of high yield efficient utilization of water and nitrogen and environmental friendliness graphical abstract ga1 keywords nitrous oxide emission ammonia volatilization soil mineral n biodegradable film loess plateau 1 introduction nitrogen n is the most demanded nutrient for the growth of cereal crops and plays an important role in improving yield hou et al 2012 however n loss is an essential issue in the field alewoye getie et al 2020 it is well known that ammonia nh3 volatilization nitrous oxide n2o emission and leaching are the main ways to n loss studies have reported that nh3 volatilization reached 8 8 109 kg n yr 1 in the chinese cropland fu et al 2020 n2o emission in agriculture accounted for about 84 of the global anthropogenic emissions ipcc 2013 and soil no3 n in the 0 4 m soil profile was as high as 453 kg ha 1 and 749 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize field in semi humid cropland respectively zhou et al 2016 these will cause serious environmental problems such as haze pm2 5 van donkelaar et al 2016 global warming valipour et al 2021 and groundwater pollution ju et al 2006 therefore it is of great importance to reduce n loss and increase n utilization of crops over fertilization caused by the pursuit of high yield is widespread in china data showed that the consumption of total n in china synthetic n accounted for over 30 increased from 8 80 105 tons in 1961 3 17 107 tons in 2013 but still as high as 2 33 107 tons in 2018 since the policy of zero increase action plan released by the central government http ifadata fertilizer org ucsearch aspx however over 25 of the applied n was lost through nh3 volatilization xu et al 2019 and about 68 of the applied n was stored in the soil as no3 n yadav 1997 resulting in a decrease of nitrogen use efficiency nue from about 65 in the 1960s to about 25 in the 2010s zhang et al 2015 previous studies have also explored the direct or indirect method of reducing n application the direct method was gradient n application li et al 2019 and the indirect methods included critical n concentration dilution curve nc aw b gastal and lemaire 2002 the relationship between n rate and increase of grain fang et al 2020 and multiple regression of two indices chlorophyll and n balance index and n nutrition index dong et al 2021 however the different objective was considered using a different method and failed to obtain a consistent or closed amount of n application in northwest china yin et al 2015 lian et al 2016 fang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to comprehensively consider factors such as yield n utilization and environmental impact to obtain an optimal n application rate the loess plateau of northwest china accounting for about 44 of the national dryland area is one of the main rainfed production areas of maize zea mays l jin et al 2007 due to insufficient 400 600 mm and uneven distribution 65 occurs in july to september of precipitation ren et al 2017 water saving practices such as film mulching are widely adopted in this area daryanto et al 2017 gu et al 2019 fang et al 2021b film mulching technology has developed rapidly since it was introduced into china in the 1970s there are many kinds of film combined with planting methods liu et al 2014 dong et al 2019a 2019b fang et al 2021a and the ridge furrow with plastic film mulch on the ridge pm has been widely adopted in northwest china gan et al 2013 studies have shown that pm could increase soil water content soil temperature plant growth shoot biomass grain yield and water use efficiency wue while reducing soil evaporation ren et al 2008 gan et al 2013 fang et al 2021a 2021b however hitherto there is little knowledge about the potential impact of pm on the environment especially the greenhouse gas emission in the field for example compared with flat planting with non mulching zheng et al 2021a 2021b reported that pm significantly increased partial productivity of n nue n2o emission greenhouse gas intensity ghgi and global warming potential gwp but decreased residual soil mineral n in the 0 200 cm besides zhang et al 2021 found that pm at the same n application level decreased n2o emission gwp and ghgi pm also could improve n absorption by plants and reduce n leaching gan et al 2013 therefore pm in combination with a suitable n fertilization rate could potentially reduce n loss in recent years biodegradable film which is expected to replace plastic film has been used in maize fang et al 2021b oilseed rape brassica napus l gu et al 2017a tomato lycopersicon esculentum moreno and moreno 2008 and peanut arachis hypogaea linn sun et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that ridge furrow with film mulching would reduce n loss by mitigating gaseous n nh3 and n2o emissions and soil mineral n leaching and maintaining soil moisture thereby improving yield and utilization of nitrogen and water the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the effect of the film mulching and n application rate on maize production gaseous n emission and nitrogen and water utilization 2 find an optimal mulching pattern and n rate to achieve green development to examine this a two year field experiment with maize crop subjected to four mulching patterns and four n application rates was conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site field trials were conducted in maize growing seasons of 2019 and 2020 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas 34 18 n 108 24 e and 521 m a s l northwest a f university china this area belongs to typical dryland in northwest china with a subhumid drought prone climate the annual meteorological data and the physicochemical properties within the 0 40 cm of soil for the study site are described in table 1 meteorological data daily maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation and sunshine hours during the maize growing seasons was recorded by a weather station yangling national meteorological observing station located about 50 m away from the field 2 2 experimental design the field trials 2019 and 2020 consisting of two parts were a completely randomized design with three replicates the first part comprised four treatments with a recommended n amount of 180 kg n ha 1 i e flat planting with non mulching nm ridge furrow with plastic film mulch over the ridge pm ridge furrow with biodegradable film mulch over the ridge bm and flat planting with full plastic film mulching fm the second part involved bm treatment with four n fertilization rates 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 denoted as bmn0 bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively the area of each plot was 28 m2 7 0 m 4 0 m and details of the planting pattern are displayed in fig 1 both the plastic polyethylene and biodegradable films which were colorless 1 0 m

of 50 80 days consisted of maize starch 40 polycaprolactone 50 grease 5 and adjuvants 5 rotary tillage was conducted at each season before maize sowing for pm and bm the ridges were formed and covered with the film before fertilization as for fm the flat surface was mulched with plastic film after fertilization n fertilizer urea phosphate fertilizer p2o5 120 kg ha 1 and potash fertilizer k2o 60 kg ha 1 were all as basal fertilizer applied by broadcasting in each plot and then raked into the soil manually no irrigation was added across the maize growing season the maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was sown with a density of 60 000 plants ha 1 and a plant spacing of 30 cm in a row on june 14 2019 and june 10 2020 and both were harvested on september 29 in the respective year weeds and diseases were controlled according to local practices during the growing seasons 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 nh3 volatilization the daily flux of nh3 volatilization from each plot except for fm treatment was measured in three replicates using the ventilation method wang et al 2004 after sowing the pvc chamber both height and diameter were 15 cm was pushed about 1 cm into the soil then two identical phosphoglycerol volume ratio of phosphoric acid to glycerol was 5 4 soaked sponges each was 2 cm in thick and 15 cm in diameter were placed in the top middle of the chamber the nh3 was collected daily after applying n fertilizer for the first week and was then collected at an interval of 2 3 d for the second week at an interval of 5 7 d for the third and fourth week and thereafter at an interval of 15 20 d until the harvest at each measurement the phosphoglycerol soaked sponges were placed at 18 00 and collected at 18 00 the next day after collection the sponges in the middle of the chamber were immediately immersed in 300 ml of 1 0 mol l 1 kcl solution in containers and were shaken for 60 min then the extracted solutions were analyzed by a continuous flow autoanalyzer autoanalyzer 3 seal analytical gmbh germany using colorimetric method hood nowotny et al 2010 the daily flux of nh3 volatilization nh 3 flux kg 1 ha 1 d 1 was calculated by 1 n h 3 f l u x a n s t f where the an is the mean amount of nh3 absorbed by the phosphoglycerol soaked sponges kg s is the cross sectional area of the pvc chamber ha t is the time of each continuous capture d f is the bare soil ratio in the plot 2 3 2 nitrous oxide emission nitrous oxide n2o emission from each plot except for fm treatment was measured in three replicates using the static closed chamber gas chromatography method zheng et al 2021b the static closed chamber included a stainless steel frame with a groove 40 40 10 cm and a stainless steel chamber 40 40 40 cm the stainless steel chamber with thermal insulation on the outside equipped with a thermometer and electric fan for gas mixing there was a pipe with a valve on the side of the chamber to connect the syringe after sowing the stainless steel frames were inserted 5 cm into the soil the collection frequency was the same as that of nh3 volatilization at each measurement the chambers were placed into the frame groove filled with water and then the gas samples were collected using a 50 ml syringe at an interval of 12 min between 9 00 and 10 00 a m alves et al 2012 the temperature in the chamber was also recorded during each gas extraction the gas samples were then analyzed using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 a agilent technologies santa clara ca equipped with an electron capture detector ecd the daily ﬂux of n2o emissions n 2 o flux was determined by 2 n 2 o f l u x ρ h d y d t 273 273 t f where the ρ is standardized state gas density of n2o kg m 3 h is the chamber height m dy dt is the ratio of n2o accumulation in the chamber t is chamber temperature and f is the bare soil ratio in the plot during the collection of n2o emissions the soil temperatures in the 10 cm layer at 5 cm intervals for nm pm and bm were recorded soil samples 0 20 cm were also collected by an auger each soil sample was divided into two parts one was to determine gravimetric soil water content using the oven dried method dried at 105 c gu et al 2019 and the other was air dried to measure ph and soil nh4 n and no3 n using colorimetric methods hood nowotny et al 2010 2 3 3 soil properties and plant n soil gravimetric water content s w c i was determined before sowing at main growth stages seedling jointing anthesis grain filling and maturity and after harvest three replicate samples were taken from the 0 200 cm soil layer at 10 cm intervals in the 0 100 cm layer and 20 cm intervals in the 100 200 cm layer before sowing and after harvest and from 0 to 100 cm soil layer at an interval of 10 cm during the growth stages in addition soil samples that were taken before sowing and after harvest were divided into two parts one was to determine the soil water content and the other was air dried to determine the content of soil mineral n nh4 n and no3 n soil water storage sws mm was calculated by eq 3 evapotranspiration et mm was calculated through the soil water balance equation eq 4 soil nh4 n or no3 n accumulation smn kg ha 1 before sowing and after harvest was calculated by eq 5 3 s w s s w c i h i γ i 4 e t p i d r δ s w s 5 s m n c i h i γ i where the γ i h i c i is the soil bulk density g cm 3 soil thickness cm and the content of nh4 n

respectively 3 2 gaseous n nh3 and n2o emissions 3 2 1 nh3 volatilization the daily fluxes of nh3 volatilization for nm pm bm bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 treatments all showed first an upward and then a downward trend reached a peak at about 3 days post sowing and stabilized at a low value two weeks post sowing during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020 fig 3a and b and fig 4a and b the daily fluxes of nh3 volatilization in pm and bm were lower than in nm across the two seasons especially in the first week after sowing during the first week post sowing compared with nm the daily flux of nh3 volatilization was significantly lowered by 16 92 36 88 in pm and 22 83 38 13 in bm during the two growing seasons furthermore the daily flux of nh3 volatilization in pm was 2 44 13 46 higher in the 2019 season but was 3 08 10 49 lower in 2020 season than in bm and there was no significant difference between them after 2 days post sowing within the first week of n application the daily flux of nh3 volatilization significantly increased with the increase of the n fertilization rate from 0 26 kg ha 1 d 1 to 6 05 kg ha 1 d 1 comparing the two years the daily flux of nh3 volatilization in the first week was 50 98 on average greater for the film mulching trials and was 39 40 greater for the n fertilization rate trials in 2019 than in 2020 the cumulative flux of nh3 volatilization was significantly lowered by 35 35 in pm and 38 32 in bm on average than in nm respectively fig 3a and b the cumulative flux of nh3 volatilization was significantly increased by n application and increased from 5 35 kg ha 1 to 35 88 kg ha 1 fig 4a and b 3 2 2 n2o emission the daily ﬂuxes of n2o emission for nm pm bm bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 treatments showed a similar trend during the 2019 and 2020 seasons and all peaked about 8 days post sowing fig 3c and d and fig 4c and d basically the daily ﬂux of n2o emission was higher in nm than in pm and bm except for after 8 days post sowing in the 2020 season during the peak period of n2o emission 5 25 days post sowing in 2019 the daily ﬂux of n2o emission was significantly lowered by 83 19 in pm and 74 20 in bm on average than in nm however

from 5 day to 25 days post sowing in 2020 the daily ﬂux of n2o emission was 97 94 and 61 14 significantly higher in bm than in pm respectively however during the 25 40 days post sowing in 2020 the daily ﬂux of n2o emission was 36 45 significantly higher in pm than in bm the peak value peak period and mean daily ﬂux of n2o emission were significantly increased with increasing the n fertilization

lower in pm and bm respectively than in fm for n fertilization rate trials the amount of soil residual nh4 n after harvest was only significantly lowered by 5 28 on average in bmn0compared to other treatments table 2 furthermore compared to bmn0 the amount of soil residual no3 n after harvest was 29 11 67 35 and 108 09 significantly higher in bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively therefore the amount

average of 9 62 in pm 3 96 in bm and 14 67 in fm in relation to nm table 2 furthermore plant n uptake was 5 44 significantly higher in pm than in bm and was 4 41 and 9 34 significantly lower in pm and bm respectively compared to fm therefore the n surplus was significantly lowered by an average of 46 94 in pm 17 32 in bm and 72 81 in fm in relation to nm furthermore n surplus in bm 24 05 kg ha 1 on average was significantly higher than in pm 15 55 kg ha 1 and fm 7 99 kg ha 1 n application significantly increased plant n uptake and n surplus from 111 90 kg ha 1 to 176 52 kg ha 1 and from 111 9 kg ha 1 to 93 48 kg ha 1 respectively 3 4 soil water storage and consumption film mulching significantly increased soil water storage and reduced soil water consumption during the growth stages of the 2019 and 2020 seasons fig 5a and b compared to nm the soil water storage in pm bm and fm was increased by 12 43 11 89 and 28 95 at seedling 13 27 12 70 and 21 32 at jointing 20 61 20 07 and 26 67 at

furthermore et was 21 35 lower in pm than in bm and was 6 81 and 36 90 higher in pm and bm respectively than in fm n application decreased soil water storage and increased soil water consumption fig 5c and d at the seedling jointing grain filling and maturity stages soil water storage was 6 83 9 39 and 12 57 lower in bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively than in bmn0 however at the anthesis stage soil

bmn2 and bmn3 respectively compared with bmn0 3 5 yield wue and n use grain yield was significantly increased by 9 59 6 71 and 21 65 on average in pm bm and fm respectively during the 2019 and 2020 seasons as compared with nm table 3 furthermore grain yield was 9 82 and 12 18 lower in pm and bm than in fm for the n fertilization trial grain yield was 31 43 50 68 and 47 17 greater in bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively than in bmn0 however excessive n application n3 also led to a 2 33 decrease in grain yield as compared with bmn2 compared to nm wue was 58 98 20 27 and 88 64 greater in pm bm and fm respectively table 3 wue was also 31 86 greater in pm than in bm while it was 15 31 and 35 14 lower in pm and bm respectively compared with fm n application also significantly increased wue wue was significantly increased by 24 06 39 24 and 34 40 in bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively in relation to bmn0 the upe was significantly higher with an average of 8 90 in pm and 13 92 in fm than in nm table

lower with 42 53 in pm and 43 55 in bm compared with nm furthermore compared with fm nhi was significantly higher with 7 43 in pm and 5 49 in bm while nue and pnp were significantly lower with 5 41 and 9 57 in pm and 4 61 except for the 2020 season and 12 18 in bm respectively for the n fertilization trial ysn was significantly higher with 170 60 in bmn1 266 85 in bmn2 and 354 46 in bmn3 but nue was only significantly higher with 4 76 in bmn1and 8 13 in bmn2 compared with bmn0 however nhi was 6 25 12 56 and 23 11 lower in bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively than in bmn0 furthermore upe and pnp were significantly decreased with increasing the n fertilization rate from 1 56 kg ha 1 to 0 65 kg ha 1 and from 86 08 kg ha 1 to 32 12 kg ha 1 respectively 3 6 relationships between soil properties and nh3 volatilization and n2o emission and relationships between yield and water and n use the data of nh3 volatilization within 10 days post sowing was selected to conduct an analysis of structural equation modeling sem fig 6a the results of sem indicated that nh3 volatilization was positively affected by soil temperature and ph but negatively affected by soil water content p 0 05 moreover soil temperature soil water content and ph together explained 69 of the total variance in nh3 volatilization soil water content negatively affected soil temperature then increased nh3 volatilization both soil water content and ph negatively affected soil nh4 n but there was no significant effect of soil nh4 n on nh3 volatilization the data of n2o emission within 20 days post sowing was selected to conduct an analysis of structural equation modeling sem fig 6b the results showed that n2o emission was positively affected by soil water content but negatively affected by soil temperature and soil nh4 n furthermore soil temperature soil water content and soil nh4 n together explained 63 of the total variance in n2o emission soil water content negatively affected soil temperature and positively affected soil nh4 n but soil temperature and soil nh4 n both limited n2o emission soil no3 n was positively affected by ph and soil nh4 n but it did not significantly affect n2o emission the relationships between yield and utilization of water and n showed that wue nue nue and pnp both pnu and upe were closely related to pnp under film mulching were all linearly correlated with yield except for nhi which had a polynomial relationship with yield fig 7 therefore reasonable utilization of n and water responding to yield was calculated by the intersection of fitting curves of nhi and nue or wue the wue nue pnu nue upe and pnp all kept high when the yield was about 9757 51 kg ha 1 the relationships between n fertilization rate and wue nue and yield indicated that wue nue and yield all firstly increased and then decreased with n rate increased from n0 to n3 but nue decreased sharply when n rate reached n3 fig 8 furthermore the relationship between wue and n rate closed to that between yield and n rate therefore an optimum n rate could be found by calculating the intersection of the fitting curves of nue and wue or yield the optimum n fertilization rate was 173 00 kg ha 1 the corresponding yield wue and nue was 8622 84 kg ha 1 17 09 kg ha 1mm 1 and 61 50 kg kg 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effect of film mulching and nitrogen fertilization rate on the loss of gaseous n in this study the nh3 volatilization under film mulching and n fertilization mainly deployed a high daily flux in the first week post sowing and reached a peak about 3 days post sowing consistent with the results of previous studies guo et al 2021 zheng et al 2021a the daily flux and cumulative flux of nh3 volatilization could be significantly decreased by film mulching but it was reversed when the n fertilization rate increased abdo et al 2021 as exemplified by the results observed here nonetheless hitherto no report on the impact of plastic and biodegradable films on nh3 volatilization in the current study the biodegradable film showed a potential to decrease nh3 volatilization previous studies have reported that greater soil nh4 n content li et al 2021a suitable rainfall sanz cobena et al 2011 high ph ma et al 2010 and increased temperature abdo et al 2021 all were conducive to high nh3 volatilization here the nh3 volatilization was positively affected by soil temperature and ph but negatively affected by the soil water content this is because rainfall after sowing fig 2 increased soil water content which reduced soil aeration thereby limiting nh3 volatilization zheng et al 2021b in the present study the daily ﬂux of n2o emission under film mulching and n fertilization treatments peaked about 8 days post sowing in line with the findings by li et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 reported that compared with flat planting with non mulching film mulching under the same n fertilization rate decreased the n2o emission but this was contrary to the results observed by he et al 2018 here both pm and bm significantly decreased the daily ﬂux of n2o during the peak period and the cumulative flux of n2o emission except for after 8 days post sowing in the 2020 season this may be due to the 25 8 1 0 and 89 5 higher rainfall temperature and sunshine hours respectively during the first month post sowing in 2020 compared to those in 2019 fig 2 this study showed that the daily ﬂux and cumulative flux of n2o emission were generally higher in bm than in pm over the two growing seasons furthermore the increase of n application significantly increased the peak value peak period and cumulative flux of n2o emission in agreement with the results of previous studies zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021a under the action of microbes soil nh4 n can be sequentially transferred to nh2oh no2 n and no3 n through nitrification while no3 n can be sequentially transferred to no2 n no n2o and n2 via denitrification zhu et al 2013 butterbach bahl et al 2013 these two processes were mainly affected by soil moisture temperature ph zheng et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 soil organic matter thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021b and soil management thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021a in this study n2o emissions among film mulching treatments were positively affected by soil water content but negatively affected by soil temperature and soil nh4 n this could be due to the fact that high soil water content negatively affected soil temperature but positively affected soil nh4 n constraining the process of denitrification by suppressing soil enzyme activity kong et al 2017 soil no3 n was positively affected by ph and soil nh4 n but it did not significantly affect n2o emission this may be related to the coupled nitrification denitrification butterbach bahl et al 2013 4 2 effect of film mulching and nitrogen application rate on soil mineral n contents and plant n uptake in the study the amount of soil residual mineral n after harvest and plant n uptake both were the highest in fm followed by pm and lowest in bm this agrees with previous studies wang et al 2019 fang et al 2021a li et al 2021a however a high amount of soil residual mineral n after harvest would cause a high risk of soil salinization especially for full film mulching or groundwater pollution for non mulching treatment halvorson et al 2005 furthermore the amount of soil residual no3 n after harvest was significantly lower while plant n uptake was significantly higher in pm as compared with bm this is because compared with bm pm increased n demand uptake for plant growth table 2 and n loss through nh3 volatilization fig 3 therefore the soil n surplus opposite to plant n uptake zheng et al 2021b which was the highest in nm and followed by bm indicating that the n fertilization rate under bm could be reduced for n fertilization treatments the amount of soil residual mineral n after harvest plant n uptake and n surplus all increased as the n fertilization rate increased from n0 to n3 this is in good agreement with the findings of previous studies quan et al 2020 chen et al 2020 zheng et al 2021a therefore an optimal n fertilization rate was essential to simultaneously achieve both enhanced crop growth and environmental friendliness 4 3 effect of film mulching and nitrogen application rate on soil water storage and crop water consumption film mulching significantly increases soil water storage during the growing seasons and reduces et especially for full film mulching wang et al 2019 consistent with this here the soil water storage in fm was the highest at most of the growth stages except for grain filling and maturity in 2020 this is probably due to the less rainfall in the later stages of growth especially in 2020 fig 2 furthermore soil water storage was only significantly higher in pm than in bm at maturity saglam et al 2017 this could be related to the disintegration of biodegradable film and less rainfall therefore the et was lowest in fm followed by pm in contrast to film mulching high n fertilization rate decreased soil water storage and increased et in line with the findings by wang et al 2019 however at the seedling stage soil water storage was the highest in bmn0 but lowest in bmn1 the reason behind this could be that low n application n1 was conducive to seedling growth zhang et al 2016 at anthesis there was no significant difference in soil water storage among bmn0 bmn1 and bmn3 which was significantly lower than in bmn2 this could be owing to that the rainfall occurred recently and the high leaf area index in bmn2 prevented the soil evaporation 4 4 effect of film mulching and nitrogen application rate on yield nitrogen use and wue film mulching could enhance plant growth and nutrient absorption but reduce soil evaporation therefore grain yield nue and wue increased wang et al 2019 previous studies mainly use nue and pnp to evaluate n use in this study more indicators were used to express the absorption and utilization of n compared with nm grain yield wue upe except for bm nhi nue and pnp were significantly higher in pm bm and fm but ysn was significantly lower in pm and bm these results were supported by previous studies wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021a 2021b li et al 2021a guo et al 2021 compared with fm grain yield wue nue and pnp were significantly lower but nhi was significantly higher in pm and bm which could be attributed to the high soil moisture and temperature of fm and full mulching that prevented n loss and leaching and increased plant growth wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 compared with pm the et was significantly higher in line with the finding by chen et al 2019 but upe nhi and wue were significantly lower in bm supported by chen et al 2021 compared with n0 grain yield wue nue except for n3 and ysn were significantly increased but nhi pnp and upe significantly decreased with increasing the n fertilization rate while excessive n application above n3 had little effect on increasing grain yield and wue similar to the findings reported in previous studies zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 li et al 2020 zheng et al 2021a it also indicated that an appropriate n fertilization rate could be found according to the relationships among yield n use and wue 4 5 optimizing film mulching treatment and n application rate previous studies have explored the effect of different film mulching treatments on yield nue and wue zheng et al 2021b fang et al 2021a however to date it remains unknown what the yield is under the film mulching when both the water and nitrogen use efficiency is higher according to the relationships between yield and n use and water use here the wue nue nue and pnp under film mulching could be kept high when the yield was about 9757 51 kg ha 1 meaning that fm full film mulching could be best mulching treatment however high pnu and soil residual mineral n after harvest but low nhi and soil water storage during the late growing period in fm would increase the risk of soil salinization and require supplementary irrigation the effects of bm on soil water storage during the main stages n utilization and yield were similar to those of pm and bm was an environmentally friendly material because it disintegrates under natural conditions this study also provided an approach to optimize the n fertilization rate based on the relationships between n rate and nue and wue or yield the results showed that the optimum n fertilization rate was 173 00 kg ha 1 and the corresponding yield wue and nue was 8622 84 kg ha 1 17 09 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 61 50 kg kg 1 respectively however fang et al 2020 found an optimal n fertilization rate under bm was 205 00 kg ha 1 according to the increase in grain weight during the grain filling stage whereas chen et al 2020 found an appropriate n fertilization rate under bm was 210 00 kg ha 1 according to soil residual no3 n and nue thus in addition to yield the optimization n fertilization rate could be influenced by the water and nitrogen utilization efficiency and a compromise could be reached therefore bm combined with 173 00 kg n ha 1could achieve the goal of high yield efficient utilization of water and nitrogen and environmental friendliness 5 conclusions film mulching was beneficial to maintain soil residual mineral n after harvest increase plant n uptake and soil water storage and reduce gaseous n emission and et compared with nm grain yield wue upe except for bm nhi nue and pnp were significantly higher in mulching treatments and ysn was significantly lower in pm and bm collectively bm was found to be the best mulching treatment in this study the gaseous n emission grain yield wue nue except for n3 and ysn all significantly increased with n rate rose however nhi pnp and upe significantly decreased with the n rate rising therefore the optimum n fertilization rate under bm was found at 173 kg ha 1 which was recommended for maize cultivation to increase yield save water and reduce environmental pollution in northwest china the n fertilization rate will be further reduced

9751,film mulching and nitrogen fertilization are two effective practices to promote maize production in northwest china but their impacts on environment in terms of greenhouse gas emission remain unclear two year field trials were conducted to 1 explore the effect of the film mulching pattern and n fertilization rate on maize production gaseous n emission and utilization of n and water 2 find an optimal mulching pattern and n fertilization rate to achieve green development trial ⅰ included flat planting with non mulching nm ridge furrow with plastic film mulch pm ridge furrow with biodegradable film mulch bm and flat planting with full plastic film mulching fm trial ⅱ involved bm with n fertilization rates 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 denoted as bmn0 bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively the results showed that film mulching significantly decreased the daily flux and cumulative flux of gaseous n by an average of 32 02 35 17 nh3 78 70 75 83 n2o respectively as compared with nm film mulching also significantly increased the amount of soil residual mineral n after harvest plant n uptake and soil water storage but decreased evapotranspiration by an average of 8 31 9 42 17 45 and 25 34 respectively as compared with nm in addition grain yield water use efficiency wue n uptake efficiency upe except for bm n harvest index nhi n use efficiency nue and partial productivity of n pnp were significantly higher in the mulching treatments and yield scaled nh3 emission ysn was significantly lower in pm and bm as compared with nm compared with fm soil residual mineral n after harvest plant n uptake grain yield wue nue and pnp were significantly lower but nhi was significantly higher in pm and bm the daily ﬂux and cumulative flux of n2o emission and the amount of soil residual no3 n after harvest were significantly lower but plant n uptake was significantly higher in pm than in bm collectively bm was the best mulching treatment in this study with increase of n fertilization rate the daily flux and cumulative flux of nh3 volatilization the peak period and the cumulative flux of n2o emission the grain yield wue nue except for n3 and ysn were significantly increased but nhi pnp and upe were significantly decreased the optimum n fertilization rate under bm was found at 173 kg ha 1 which could achieve the goal of high yield efficient utilization of water and nitrogen and environmental friendliness graphical abstract ga1 keywords nitrous oxide emission ammonia volatilization soil mineral n biodegradable film loess plateau 1 introduction nitrogen n is the most demanded nutrient for the growth of cereal crops and plays an important role in improving yield hou et al 2012 however n loss is an essential issue in the field alewoye getie et al 2020 it is well known that ammonia nh3 volatilization nitrous oxide n2o emission and leaching are the main ways to n loss studies have reported that nh3 volatilization reached 8 8 109 kg n yr 1 in the chinese cropland fu et al 2020 n2o emission in agriculture accounted for about 84 of the global anthropogenic emissions ipcc 2013 and soil no3 n in the 0 4 m soil profile was as high as 453 kg ha 1 and 749 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize field in semi humid cropland respectively zhou et al 2016 these will cause serious environmental problems such as haze pm2 5 van donkelaar et al 2016 global warming valipour et al 2021 and groundwater pollution ju et al 2006 therefore it is of great importance to reduce n loss and increase n utilization of crops over fertilization caused by the pursuit of high yield is widespread in china data showed that the consumption of total n in china synthetic n accounted for over 30 increased from 8 80 105 tons in 1961 3 17 107 tons in 2013 but still as high as 2 33 107 tons in 2018 since the policy of zero increase action plan released by the central government http ifadata fertilizer org ucsearch aspx however over 25 of the applied n was lost through nh3 volatilization xu et al 2019 and about 68 of the applied n was stored in the soil as no3 n yadav 1997 resulting in a decrease of nitrogen use efficiency nue from about 65 in the 1960s to about 25 in the 2010s zhang et al 2015 previous studies have also explored the direct or indirect method of reducing n application the direct method was gradient n application li et al 2019 and the indirect methods included critical n concentration dilution curve nc aw b gastal and lemaire 2002 the relationship between n rate and increase of grain fang et al 2020 and multiple regression of two indices chlorophyll and n balance index and n nutrition index dong et al 2021 however the different objective was considered using a different method and failed to obtain a consistent or closed amount of n application in northwest china yin et al 2015 lian et al 2016 fang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to comprehensively consider factors such as yield n utilization and environmental impact to obtain an optimal n application rate the loess plateau of northwest china accounting for about 44 of the national dryland area is one of the main rainfed production areas of maize zea mays l jin et al 2007 due to insufficient 400 600 mm and uneven distribution 65 occurs in july to september of precipitation ren et al 2017 water saving practices such as film mulching are widely adopted in this area daryanto et al 2017 gu et al 2019 fang et al 2021b film mulching technology has developed rapidly since it was introduced into china in the 1970s there are many kinds of film combined with planting methods liu et al 2014 dong et al 2019a 2019b fang et al 2021a and the ridge furrow with plastic film mulch on the ridge pm has been widely adopted in northwest china gan et al 2013 studies have shown that pm could increase soil water content soil temperature plant growth shoot biomass grain yield and water use efficiency wue while reducing soil evaporation ren et al 2008 gan et al 2013 fang et al 2021a 2021b however hitherto there is little knowledge about the potential impact of pm on the environment especially the greenhouse gas emission in the field for example compared with flat planting with non mulching zheng et al 2021a 2021b reported that pm significantly increased partial productivity of n nue n2o emission greenhouse gas intensity ghgi and global warming potential gwp but decreased residual soil mineral n in the 0 200 cm besides zhang et al 2021 found that pm at the same n application level decreased n2o emission gwp and ghgi pm also could improve n absorption by plants and reduce n leaching gan et al 2013 therefore pm in combination with a suitable n fertilization rate could potentially reduce n loss in recent years biodegradable film which is expected to replace plastic film has been used in maize fang et al 2021b oilseed rape brassica napus l gu et al 2017a tomato lycopersicon esculentum moreno and moreno 2008 and peanut arachis hypogaea linn sun et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that ridge furrow with film mulching would reduce n loss by mitigating gaseous n nh3 and n2o emissions and soil mineral n leaching and maintaining soil moisture thereby improving yield and utilization of nitrogen and water the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the effect of the film mulching and n application rate on maize production gaseous n emission and nitrogen and water utilization 2 find an optimal mulching pattern and n rate to achieve green development to examine this a two year field experiment with maize crop subjected to four mulching patterns and four n application rates was conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site field trials were conducted in maize growing seasons of 2019 and 2020 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas 34 18 n 108 24 e and 521 m a s l northwest a f university china this area belongs to typical dryland in northwest china with a subhumid drought prone climate the annual meteorological data and the physicochemical properties within the 0 40 cm of soil for the study site are described in table 1 meteorological data daily maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation and sunshine hours during the maize growing seasons was recorded by a weather station yangling national meteorological observing station located about 50 m away from the field 2 2 experimental design the field trials 2019 and 2020 consisting of two parts were a completely randomized design with three replicates the first part comprised four treatments with a recommended n amount of 180 kg n ha 1 i e flat planting with non mulching nm ridge furrow with plastic film mulch over the ridge pm ridge furrow with biodegradable film mulch over the ridge bm and flat planting with full plastic film mulching fm the second part involved bm treatment with four n fertilization rates 0 90 180 and 270 kg n ha 1 denoted as bmn0 bmn1 bmn2 and bmn3 respectively the area of each plot was 28 m2 7 0 m 4 0 m and details of the planting pattern are displayed in fig 1 both the plastic polyethylene and biodegradable films which were colorless 1 0 m

of 50 80 days consisted of maize starch 40 polycaprolactone 50 grease 5 and adjuvants 5 rotary tillage was conducted at each season before maize sowing for pm and bm the ridges were formed and covered with the film before fertilization as for fm the flat surface was mulched with plastic film after fertilization n fertilizer urea phosphate fertilizer p2o5 120 kg ha 1 and potash fertilizer k2o 60 kg ha 1 were all as basal fertilizer applied by broadcasting in each plot and then raked into the soil manually no irrigation was added across the maize growing season the maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was sown with a density of 60 000 plants ha 1 and a plant spacing of 30 cm in a row on june 14 2019 and june 10 2020 and both were harvested on september 29 in the respective year weeds and diseases were controlled according to local practices during the growing seasons 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 nh3 volatilization the daily flux of nh3 volatilization from each plot except for fm treatment was measured in three replicates using the ventilation method wang et al 2004 after sowing the pvc chamber both height and diameter were 15 cm was pushed about 1 cm into the soil then two identical phosphoglycerol volume ratio of phosphoric acid to glycerol was 5 4 soaked sponges each was 2 cm in thick and 15 cm in diameter were placed in the top middle of the chamber the nh3 was collected daily

and nh3 volatilization and n2o emission and relationships between yield and water and n use the data of nh3 volatilization within 10 days post sowing was selected to conduct an analysis of structural equation modeling sem fig 6a the results of sem indicated that nh3 volatilization was positively affected by soil temperature and ph but negatively affected by soil water content p 0 05 moreover soil temperature soil water content and ph together explained 69 of the total variance in nh3 volatilization soil water content negatively affected soil temperature then increased nh3 volatilization both soil water content and ph negatively affected soil nh4 n but there was no significant effect of soil nh4 n on nh3 volatilization the data of n2o emission within 20 days post sowing was selected to conduct an analysis of structural equation modeling sem fig 6b the results showed that n2o emission was positively affected by soil water content but negatively affected by soil temperature and soil nh4 n furthermore soil temperature soil water content and soil nh4 n together explained 63 of the total variance in n2o emission soil water content negatively affected soil temperature and positively affected soil nh4 n but soil temperature and soil nh4 n both limited n2o emission soil no3 n was positively affected by ph and soil nh4 n but it did not significantly affect n2o emission the relationships between yield and utilization of water and n showed that wue nue nue and pnp both pnu and upe were closely related to pnp under film mulching were all linearly correlated with yield except for nhi which had a polynomial relationship with yield fig 7 therefore reasonable utilization of n and water responding to yield was calculated by the intersection of fitting curves of nhi and nue or wue the wue nue pnu nue upe and pnp all kept high when the yield was about 9757 51 kg ha 1 the relationships between n fertilization rate and wue nue and yield indicated that wue nue and yield all firstly increased and then decreased with n rate increased from n0 to n3 but nue decreased sharply when n rate reached n3 fig 8 furthermore the relationship between wue and n rate closed to that between yield and n rate therefore an optimum n rate could be found by calculating the intersection of the fitting curves of nue and wue or yield the optimum n fertilization rate was 173 00 kg ha 1 the corresponding yield wue and nue was 8622 84 kg ha 1 17 09 kg ha 1mm 1 and 61 50 kg kg 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effect of film mulching and nitrogen fertilization rate on the loss of gaseous n in this study the nh3 volatilization under film mulching and n fertilization mainly deployed a high daily flux in the first week post sowing and reached a peak about 3 days post sowing consistent with the results of previous studies guo et al 2021 zheng et al 2021a the daily flux and cumulative flux of nh3 volatilization could be significantly decreased by film mulching but it was reversed when the n fertilization rate increased abdo et al 2021 as exemplified by the results observed here nonetheless hitherto no report on the impact of plastic and biodegradable films on nh3 volatilization in the current study the biodegradable film showed a potential to decrease nh3 volatilization previous studies have reported that greater soil nh4 n content li et al 2021a suitable rainfall sanz cobena et al 2011 high ph ma et al 2010 and increased temperature abdo et al 2021 all were conducive to high nh3 volatilization here the nh3 volatilization was positively affected by soil temperature and ph but negatively affected by the soil water content this is because rainfall after sowing fig 2 increased soil water content which reduced soil aeration thereby limiting nh3 volatilization zheng et al 2021b in the present study the daily ﬂux of n2o emission under film mulching and n fertilization treatments peaked about 8 days post sowing in line with the findings by li et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 reported that compared with flat planting with non mulching film mulching under the same n fertilization rate decreased the n2o emission but this was contrary to the results observed by he et al 2018 here both pm and bm significantly decreased the daily ﬂux of n2o during the peak period and the cumulative flux of n2o emission except for after 8 days post sowing in the 2020 season this may be due to the 25 8 1 0 and 89 5 higher rainfall temperature and sunshine hours respectively during the first month post sowing in 2020 compared to those in 2019 fig 2 this study showed that the daily ﬂux and cumulative flux of n2o emission were generally higher in bm than in pm over the two growing seasons furthermore the increase of n application significantly increased the peak value peak period and cumulative flux of n2o emission in agreement with the results of previous studies zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021a under the action of microbes soil nh4 n can be sequentially transferred to nh2oh no2 n and no3 n through nitrification while no3 n can be sequentially transferred to no2 n no n2o and n2 via denitrification zhu et al 2013 butterbach bahl et al 2013 these two processes were mainly affected by soil moisture temperature ph zheng et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 soil organic matter thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021b and soil management thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021a in this study n2o emissions among film mulching treatments were positively affected by soil water content but negatively affected by soil temperature and soil nh4 n this could be due to the fact that high soil water content negatively affected soil temperature but positively affected soil nh4 n constraining the process of denitrification by suppressing soil enzyme activity kong et al 2017 soil no3 n was positively affected by ph and soil nh4 n but it did not significantly affect n2o emission this may be related to the coupled nitrification denitrification butterbach bahl et al 2013 4 2 effect of film mulching and nitrogen application rate on soil mineral n contents and plant n uptake in the study the amount of soil residual mineral n after harvest and plant n uptake both were the highest in fm followed by pm and lowest in bm this agrees with previous studies wang et al 2019 fang et al 2021a li et al 2021a however a high amount of soil residual mineral n after harvest would cause a high risk of soil salinization especially for full film mulching or groundwater pollution for non mulching treatment halvorson et al 2005 furthermore the amount of soil residual no3 n after harvest was significantly lower while plant n uptake was significantly higher in pm as compared with bm this is because compared with bm pm increased n demand uptake for plant growth table 2 and n loss through nh3 volatilization fig 3 therefore the soil n surplus opposite to plant n uptake zheng et al 2021b which was the highest in nm and followed by bm indicating that the n fertilization rate under bm could be reduced for n fertilization treatments the amount of soil residual mineral n after harvest plant n uptake and n surplus all increased as the n fertilization rate increased from n0 to n3 this is in good agreement with the findings of previous studies quan et al 2020 chen et al 2020 zheng et al 2021a therefore an optimal n fertilization rate was essential to simultaneously achieve both enhanced crop growth and environmental friendliness 4 3 effect of film mulching and nitrogen application rate on soil water storage and crop water consumption film mulching significantly increases soil water storage during the growing seasons and reduces et especially for full film mulching wang et al 2019 consistent with this here the soil water storage in fm was the highest at most of the growth stages except for grain filling and maturity in 2020 this is probably due to the less rainfall in the later stages of growth especially in 2020 fig 2 furthermore soil water storage was only significantly higher in pm than in bm at maturity saglam et al 2017 this could be related to the disintegration of biodegradable film and less rainfall therefore the et was lowest in fm followed by pm in contrast to film mulching high n fertilization rate decreased soil water storage and increased et in line with the findings by wang et al 2019 however at the seedling stage soil water storage was the highest in bmn0 but lowest in bmn1 the reason behind this could be that low n application n1 was conducive to seedling growth zhang et al 2016 at anthesis there was no significant difference in soil water storage among bmn0 bmn1 and bmn3 which was significantly lower than in bmn2 this could be owing to that the rainfall occurred recently and the high leaf area index in bmn2 prevented the soil evaporation 4 4 effect of film mulching and nitrogen application rate on yield nitrogen use and wue film mulching could enhance plant growth and nutrient absorption but reduce soil evaporation therefore grain yield nue and wue increased wang et al 2019 previous studies mainly use nue and pnp to evaluate n use in this study more indicators were used to express the absorption and utilization of n compared with nm grain yield wue upe except for bm nhi nue and pnp were significantly higher in pm bm and fm but ysn was significantly lower in pm and bm these results were supported by previous studies wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021a 2021b li et al 2021a guo et al 2021 compared with fm grain yield wue nue and pnp were significantly lower but nhi was significantly higher in pm and bm which could be attributed to the high soil moisture and temperature of fm and full mulching that prevented n loss and leaching and increased plant growth wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 compared with pm the et was significantly higher in line with the finding by chen et al 2019 but upe nhi and wue were significantly lower in bm supported by chen et al 2021 compared with n0 grain yield wue nue except for n3 and ysn were significantly increased but nhi pnp and upe significantly decreased with increasing the n fertilization rate while excessive n application above n3 had little effect on increasing grain yield and wue similar to the findings reported in previous studies zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 li et al 2020 zheng et al 2021a it also indicated that an appropriate n fertilization rate could be found according to the relationships among yield n use and wue 4 5 optimizing film mulching treatment and n application rate previous studies have explored the effect of different film mulching treatments on yield nue and wue zheng et al 2021b fang et al 2021a however to date it remains unknown what the yield is under the film mulching when both the water and nitrogen use efficiency is higher according to the relationships between yield and n use and water use here the wue nue nue and pnp under film mulching could be kept high when the yield was about 9757 51 kg ha 1 meaning that fm full film mulching could be best mulching treatment however high pnu and soil residual mineral n after harvest but low nhi and soil water storage during the late growing period in fm would increase the risk of soil salinization and require supplementary irrigation the effects of bm on soil water storage during the main stages n utilization and yield were similar to those of pm and bm was an environmentally friendly material because it disintegrates under natural conditions this study also provided an approach to optimize the n fertilization rate based on the relationships between n rate and nue and wue or yield the results showed that the optimum n fertilization rate was 173 00 kg ha 1 and the corresponding yield wue and nue was 8622 84 kg ha 1 17 09 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 61 50 kg kg 1 respectively however fang et al 2020 found an optimal n fertilization rate under bm was 205 00 kg ha 1 according to the increase in grain weight during the grain filling stage whereas chen et al 2020 found an appropriate n fertilization rate under bm was 210 00 kg ha 1 according to soil residual no3 n and nue thus in addition to yield the optimization n fertilization rate could be influenced by the water and nitrogen utilization efficiency and a compromise could be reached therefore bm combined with 173 00 kg n ha 1could achieve the goal of high yield efficient utilization of water and nitrogen and environmental friendliness 5 conclusions film mulching was beneficial to maintain soil residual mineral n after harvest increase plant n uptake and soil water storage and reduce gaseous n emission and et compared with nm grain yield wue upe except for bm nhi nue and pnp were significantly higher in mulching treatments and ysn was significantly lower in pm and bm collectively bm was found to be the best mulching treatment in this study the gaseous n emission grain yield wue nue except for n3 and ysn all significantly increased with n rate rose however nhi pnp and upe significantly decreased with the n rate rising therefore the optimum n fertilization rate under bm was found at 173 kg ha 1 which was recommended for maize cultivation to increase yield save water and reduce environmental pollution in northwest china the n fertilization rate will be further reduced

9752,in europe most of vineyards are managed under rainfed conditions where water deficit has become increasingly an issue the flowering veraison phenophase represents an important period for vine response to water stress which is known to depend on variety characteristics soil and climate conditions in this paper we have carried out a retrospective analysis for important european wine regions over 1986 2015 with objectives to assess the mean crop water stress indicator cwsi during flowering veraison phase and potential yield lose rate ylr due to seasonal cumulative water stress moreover we also investigate if advanced flowering veraison phase can lead to alleviated cwsi under recent past conditions thus contributing to reduced ylr a process based grapevine model is employed which has been extensively calibrated for simulating both flowering and veraison stages using location specific observations representing 10 different varieties subsequently grid based modelling is implemented with gridded climate and soil datasets and calibrated phenology parameters the findings suggest wine regions with higher mean cwsi of flowering veraison phase tend to have higher potential ylr however contrasting patterns are found between wine regions in france germany luxembourg and italy portugal spain the former tends to have slight to moderate drought conditions cwsi 0 5 along with a negligible to moderate ylr 30 whereas the latter is found to have severe to extreme drought cwsi 0 5 and substantial ylr 40 wine regions prone to a high drought risk cwsi 0 75 are also identified which are concentrated in southern mediterranean europe advanced flowering veraison phase over 1986 2015 could have benefited from more spring precipitation and cooler temperatures for wine regions of italy portugal spain leading to reduced mean cwsi and ylr for those of france germany luxembourg this can have reduced flowering veraison precipitation but prevalent reductions of ylr are also found possibly due to shifted phase towards a cooler growing season with reduced evaporative demands our study demonstrates flowering verasion water deficit is critical for potential yield which can have different impacts between central and southern european wine regions this phase can be advanced under a warmer climate thus having important implications for european rainfed vineyards the overall outcome may provide new insights for appropriate viticultural management of seasonal water deficits under climate change keywords grapevine modelling drought stress yield gap phenology network stics regional crop modelling 1 introduction grapevine vitis vinifera is a major fruit crop of economic importance worldwide europe is the world leader in wine production which accounts for about 63 of world wine production in 2020 oiv 2021 most of the winegrowing regions in europe are currently cultivated under rainfed conditions with only 10 of vineyards irrigated as a consequence of policy restriction e g regulation rules in denominations of origin do and concerns for sustainable water use costa et al 2016 for rainfed viticulture water deficit stress has become increasingly an issue even in relatively cooler and wetter european countries such as france germany and luxembourg santos et al 2020 van leeuwen et al 2019 this can be possibly attributed to the rising temperatures in the last decades accompanied by more extreme weather events such as heatwaves fraga et al 2020 accordingly the evapotranspiration from plant and soil has increased which results in increasingly negative soil water balance van leeuwen et al 2019 in southern mediterranean countries such as italy portugal spain vine growth is frequently exposed to drought stress leading to reductions in yield and if with severe water stress impaired wine quality attributes costa et al 2016 van leeuwen et al 2018 in these wine regions water deficit combined with high temperatures in summer during the berry ripening period can represent a major limiting factor for vineyard productivity chacón vozmediano et al 2020 costa et al 2016 moreover water deficits can be further exacerbated under climate change in terms of frequency and intensity which can be particularly pronounced in currently most vulnerable regions e g southern mediterranean regions costa et al 2016 giorgi and lionello 2008 santos et al 2020 mild or moderate water deficits generally favour the berry accumulation of sugar and some phenolics e g anthocyanin whereas severe water stresses can lead to significantly reduced berry quality sugar aroma and grape yield van leeuwen et al 2018 2009 the effect of water availability varies with the variety limited water supply can increase skin phenolics e g anthocyanins which is crucial for the production of high quality red grapes whereas this may negatively affect the aromas of white grapes van leeuwen et al 2019 2018 however the effects of water deficit also depend on its timing and duration gambetta et al 2020 before veraison berries are hydraulically connected to vine and are sensitive to drought induced shrivelling but they are largely insensitive at after veraison since berries become buffered from changes in vine s water status gambetta et al 2020 water shortage before veraison can have strong negative impacts on leaf growth berry weight and final yield per vine chacón vozmediano et al 2020 gambetta et al 2020 van leeuwen et al 2018 wenter et al 2018 one of the most important pre veraison phenophase corresponds to the flowering veraison phase which proves to be an important period for berry weight and yield determinations chacón vozmediano et al 2020 gaudin et al 2014 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 for instance ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 found grape yield to be particularly sensitive to water availability of bloom veraison period during which a yield increase of about 46 kg ha per mm water input is observed therefore it is of importance to focus on how to increase water availability and mitigate possible water stress over this period while not using irrigation when it is restricted in southern mediterranean countries it is presumed an early occurrence of this phase can benefit from higher precipitations as a considerable fraction of annual precipitation can occur between bud break and flowering period ramos et al 2020 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 besides advanced flowering veraison phase can reduce crop exposure to extreme high summer temperature that frequently exceeds 35 c in these regions giorgi and lionello 2008 yang et al 2018 however the magnitudes of these effects on alleviating water stress of flowering veraison period are not quantified to our knowledge especially over a large geographic area moreover the potential impacts of such shifted phenophase in those relatively cooler and wetter european wine regions are yet to be well understood to determine the level of water deficit experienced by plants measurements of leaf water potential at pre dawn ψpd and midday ψmid and the stem water potentials ψstem are often carried out which are standard field methods to monitor vine water status van leeuwen et al 2018 2009 although these are useful plant water stress indicators they need frequent field measurements to obtain meaningful results which are often laborious and costly as an alternative an empirical crop water stress indicator cwsi developed by idso et al 1981 and jackson 1982 is also frequently applied to diagnose vine water status by relating the difference of canopy air temperature to the air vapor pressure deficit of a non water stressed baseline bellvert et al 2015 cwsi can be conveniently estimated from remote sensed thermal image data which can allow us to accurately monitor vine water status throughout the growing season bellvert et al 2015 however to develop appropriate guidelines or agricultural policies for better management of seasonal water deficits water stress indicators like cwsi need to be applied at the regional level to consider possible differences between vineyards in soil properties and climate conditions for this purpose several studies have applied biophysical models to simulate cwsi for example to monitor drought variability over the koshi river basin in central asia wu et al 2019 or for constructing the drought vulnerability curve for six main maize growing regions in china zhu et al 2021 process based crop models have proven to be useful tools to simulate the complex interactions among genotypes management and environment g m e and their impacts on desired outputs e g water use and yield coucheney et al 2015 rötter et al 2018 the advantages of model derived water stress indicators are being continuous over the season which allow comparison between sites with different environmental conditions by coupling with high resolution gridded datasets these models can be implemented at regional level to simulate crop water status and water stress conditions taking into account genotype dependent crop response to water deficits while integrating the effects of site dependent climate variability and soil characteristics ceglar et al 2019 fraga et al 2016 zhu et al 2021 some of these models that have been successfully adapted to grapevine are unifi grapeml leolini et al 2018a phenologyvv stock et al 2007 uniphen molitor et al 2020 and stics brisson et al 2009 garcía de cortázar atauri 2006 in particular fraga et al 2015 and valdés gómez et al 2009 have demonstrated a good agreement between water stress indices simulated by stics and those measured in the field ψpd and ψmid stics has also extensively shown its capacities in reliably simulating soil water content plant water stress phenology and yield for grapevine under various environmental conditions coucheney et al 2015 fraga et al 2016 2015 valdés gómez et al 2009 for regional model applications phenology parameters are the most common parameters to be calibrated adjusted angulo et al 2013 ceglar et al 2019 particularly for simulating phenology dependent water stress besides reliable phenology simulations can also contribute to improving estimations of potential yield that is closely related to the length of the growing season van ittersum et al 2013 for winegrowers it is not always beneficial to pursue higher yields because they can compromise wine quality but a reasonable production level should be safeguarded for wine growing estates to be economically sustainable therefore it is of practical importance to understand and quantify to what extent the seasonal water stress can impose limitations on potentially attainable yields especially to evaluate the role of a drought sensitive period i e flowering veraison phase ramos et al 2020 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 such yield gap analysis is often carried out for annual field crops like wheat and maize van ittersum et al 2013 it is however rarely performed for grapevine as overall more attention is given to quality attributes hence our study may contribute to fill the gap in this regard in europe the leading five wine producing countries are italy 49 1 million hectoliter i e mhl france 46 6 mhl spain 40 7 mhl germany 8 4 mhl and portugal 6 4 mhl respectively oiv 2021 these countries together account for about 58 of world wine production in 2020 with a total exported wine worth 19 billion euros oiv 2021 adequate production of high quality wines plays an important role in the local economy therefore these countries were chosen in our analysis additionally we have added luxembourg that shares a wider wine region with germany the moselle valley important wine regions are identified within these countries accordingly for these wine regions over a study period of 1986 2015 we aim to i assess vine drought stress conditions exclusively during the flowering veraison phase using cwsi that is constructed from model simulation outputs ii assess the potential yield lose rate ylr due to seasonal cumulative water stress yield refers to mean cluster weight at harvest the possible link between cwsi and ylr is also analyzed lastly as a retrospective analysis we also aim to iii investigate if shifted flowering veraison phase can lead to both alleviated cwsi and ylr under recent past conditions 2 data and methods 2 1 workflow summary an extensive site based model calibration is performed using stics model across studied wine regions before being up scaled to regional level with grid based simulations for cwsi and potential ylr over 1986 2015 based on the setup we also investigated potential impacts of early shifted flowering veraison phase a schematic overview of the workflow is presented in fig 1 which will be described in details in subsequent sections 2 2 studied wine regions and selected sites in europe the major wine regions in the studied six european countries were identified fig 2 in accordance with those in fraga et al 2020 previous analysis revealed several wine regions in france germany and luxembourg tended to be vulnerable to heatwave fraga et al 2020 however they are yet to be selected for a drought impact analysis which are often connected with high temperature episodes on the other hand southern mediterranean europe such as italy portugal and spain were already exposed to increasingly warmer and drier climate accompanied by more frequent and longer weather extremes costa et al 2016 mediterranean region was projected to be one of the meteorological drought hot spots giorgi and lionello 2008 across these wine regions 38 sites were selected fig 2 where the flowering bbch65 and veraison data bbch81 were obtained for 10 different grapevine varieties representing locally dominant varieties table s1 the data was mainly collected within the framework of the clim4vitis project https clim4vitis eu from vineyard based observations but also complemented by data from the pan european phenology project pep725 templ et al 2018 and from the italian phenological network iphen mariani et al 2013 however it shall be emphasized that pep725 data lacked specific variety information for our selected sites while iphen data generally covered short periods observed data was only used for calibration when fulfilled the following criteria 1 data was measured within the study period 1986 2015 and 2 flowering and veraison stages were recorded in the same year except sites with only flowering or veraison data detailed information on the site coordinates and names related varieties data length and source were summarized in table s1 2 3 stics grapevine modules this section presented stics grapevine modules v9 2 that were most relevant in this study while a more comprehensive presentation of the model structure and formalisms can be found in several other studies brisson et al 2003 2009 garcía de cortázar atauri et al 2009a b garcía de cortázar atauri 2006 2 3 1 phenology module the phenophase between dormancy onset and budbreak was simulated using the brin model which successively calculated the period from dormancy onset to dormancy break and from dormancy break to budbreak garcía de cortázar atauri et al 2009a the dormancy period calculation was based on bidabe s cold action model bidabe 1965 taking into account the genotype dependent chilling requirement expressed as chilling units or effective dormancy days dd the post dormancy period after dormancy break was calculated based on richardson s chilling hour units richardson et al 1974 with cardinal temperatures defined to limit the function of a linear response a critical sum of growing degree hours pd post dormancy thermal requirement was considered and assumed to be genotype dependent the subsequent stages such as flowering veraison and fruit maturity were all simulated using the classic growing degree day gdd celsius degree day model with a 10 base temperature brisson et al 2009 the flowering stage was mainly controlled by two parameters which defined budbreak to fruit setting and flowering to fruit setting period respectively the former one was generally a sensitive parameter with substantial influence on other simulation outputs e g lai biomass and yield whereas the latter one was only built for additional adjustment of flowering stage without any effects on the other processes brisson et al 2009 thus we only chose to calibrate the gdd requirement between the budbreak and fruit setting onset which was denoted as fl for the veraison onset the parameter for gdd requirement between the end of juvenile phase and veraison onset was chosen for calibration defined as vr these phenology parameters are all genotype dependent 2 3 2 water use module soil water balance simulations represented an essential component of soil crop system modeling the resulting simulated maximum et max and actual evapotranspiration et largely determine the soil water content and the crop water stress conditions which in turn affects the potential canopy growth biomass accumulation and yield at harvest the et max can be divided into maximum soil evaporation e max and crop transpiration t max for grapevine the e max was estimated by available energy in the soil surface following the energy balance approach brisson et al 2009 cf supplementary material for details the actual soil evaporation e was calculated by a semi empirical model developed by brisson and perrier 1991 soil evaporation is maximum e max until reaching a cumulative threshold estimated by particle size distribution then e is calculated considering the soil type weather influence and most importantly the actual soil water availability brisson et al 2009 t max represents the crop water requirement which was calculated using the shuttleworth and wallace s w model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 s w is a resistance model that characterizes the soil plant atmosphere system with a resistance network which proved to be effective in explaining the canopy energy budget brisson et al 1998 the advantage of using the s w model consists in its ability to consider the influence of soil evaporation on t max whereas this is absent in other approaches e g dual crop coefficient allen et al 1998 however s w is a complex model holding many parameters and assumptions while a variety of input data on meteorology and crop characteristics e g canopy height is required brisson et al 1998 cf supplementary material for detailed t max calculations the actual transpiration t is calculated based on the available soil water content in the root zone crop transpiration is at the maximum rate t max unless the available soil water content is below a certain threshold such threshold was calculated at a daily time step depending on the root density a plant stomatal function and t max brisson et al 2009 the ratio t t max was computed as the crop water stress index which was shown to be closely correlated with measured ψpd and ψmid with a variety dependent r2 up to 0 89 and 0 94 respectively fraga et al 2015 valdés gómez et al 2009 2 3 3 yield module yield formation was essentially a process of dry matter allocation to fruits during the fruit setting to maturity period a boxcar train technique was applied to account for the asynchronous nature of berry maturation with the concept of fruit age class number of artificially imposed berry growth compartments goudriaan and van roermund 1993 it attempted to mimic the physiological changes occurring over the berry ripening process for each compartment the berry growth a dry matter allocation coefficient was differently calculated depending on the number of setting berries potential berry growth rate cell division and expansion and possibly any abiotic stress effects garcía de cortázar atauri et al 2009b 2 4 simulation setup 2 4 1 automatic model calibrations at selected 38 sites the purpose of the phenology calibration partial calibration was to partly account for sampling the considerable spatial variabilities of genotypes used in these wine regions for each study site fig 2 and table s1 the four phenology parameters explained in section 2 3 1 were calibrated a range was predefined for each of these parameters dd 40 205 pd 6000 11500 fl 230 560 and vr 600 1700 these ranges generally covered a large genotypic variability garcía de cortázar atauri 2006 which were evenly sampled with 11 intervals per parameter resulting in a total of 20 000 parameter combinations tested per site parameter induced variations represented a major source of uncertainties in crop model simulations while estimations of best fit parameters rely on a clearly outlined calibration approach seidel et al 2018 wallach et al 2011 we estimated parameter values by minimizing the sum of mean squared error mse between observations and simulations over the two successive stages following the ordinary least square approach wallach et al 2011 previous analysis revealed that minimizing the sum of mse was an appropriate goodness of fit criterion particularly when there were multiple measurements over time in the same plot containing prediction error correlation and heteroscedasticity wallach et al 2011 however when only flowering or veraison data was available total 8 sites the mse was minimized for a single stage accordingly following the model calibration the goodness of fit between observations and simulations with estimated parameters were evaluated using mean biased errors mbe mean absolute errors mae root mean squared errors rmse and pearson correlation coefficient r refer to yang et al 2021 for more details on the overall calibration approach the calibrated parameters shown in fig s1 can generally well reproduce the inter annual variability of observed data with negligible mean bias fig s2 s6 detailed description of overall calibration results including the goodness of fit between observations and simulations for each site was presented in the supplementary material 2 4 2 input data for grid based simulations grid based simulations were feed with inputs from estimated phenology parameters from the closest measured by euclidean distance calibration site and from gridded climate soil and terrain datasets fig 1 the required daily surface temperature c and precipitation sum mm were directly obtained from the recent release of the e obs dataset v22 0e at an enhanced resolution of 0 1 0 1 cornes et al 2018 mean seasonal april september temperature c and precipitation sum mm were calculated over 1986 2015 besides we also calculated maximum consecutive number of hot days chd consecutive days with daily maximum temperature 25 c and of dry days cdd consecutive days with daily total precipitation 1 mm to characterize the duration of extreme events over 1986 2015 daily surface solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 wind speed m s 1 and actual vapor pressure hpa were obtained and processed from era5 land hourly reanalysis data 0 1 0 1 muñoz sabater 2019 the hourly 10 m wind speed was firstly calculated from respective zonal and meridional wind components before being adjusted to the standard 2 m height following logarithmic profile allen et al 1998 daily mean vapor pressure was estimated from the dew point temperature at daily minimum and maximum with the exponential function allen et al 1998 for soil inputs some important soil properties such as soil texture particle size distribution ph bulk density and surface dry albedo were retrieved from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 2 at 1 km resolution fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 soil hydraulic properties e g field capacity and wilting point were derived from eu soilhydrogrids 1 km v1 0 which provided european wide estimates at seven standard soil depths up to 2 m tóth et al 2017 to account for complex terrain conditions the european digital elevation model eu dem v1 1 at 25 m grid resolution was employed to supply surface slope information more detailed information on how gridded soil datasets were assimilated into stics is available in yang et al 2020 by overlaying the climatic grids soil and terrain maps the simulation unit was determined at a regular grid of 0 1 0 1 resolution taking into account the trade off between accuracy in resolving spatial gradients and computation workloads avoid excessive and repetitive soil information appearing within a given climatic grid it was noteworthy the gridded data was also used for aforementioned site based calibrations 2 4 3 assessing the cwsi and ylr over 1986 2015 mean cwsi of the flowering veraison phase hereafter cwsi was computed at each grid point for each year over 1986 2015 the cwsi was computed according to zhu et al 2021 1 cwsi 1 et et max where et and et max were daily model outputs with detailed calculation procedures explained in section 2 3 2 it integrated the effect of climate soil and crop characteristics which has been widely applied for drought monitoring and assessment wu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 according to wu et al 2019 cwsi can be divided into four categories 0 0 25 as slight drought 0 25 0 5 as moderate drought 0 5 0 75 as severe drought and 0 75 1 as extreme drought wu et al 2019 similar to zhu et al 2021 cwsi was calculated as the mean instead of sum over a target phase with the advantages to preserve its physical meanings and allow comparison of drought intensities among regions the potential ylr was also simulated for each grid over 1986 2015 which in accordance with zhu et al 2021 was computed as follow 2 ylr 1 y stress y potential 100 where y stress and y potential were the potential cluster weight g at harvest simulated with and without water stress respectively to reduce uncertainties of spatial simulations associated with heterogeneous vineyard managements we focused only on mean cluster weight g at harvest hereafter referred to as yield the advantage was to avoid the need to specify the other two yield components local planting density vines ha and mean harvestable cluster numbers per vine dependent on the variety training system and viticulture practices y potential represented potentially attainable yield in absence of any abiotic and biotic stresses together with optimum farming practices van ittersum et al 2013 it is only affected by seasonal temperature radiation co2 level and crop genetic traits e g potential fruit size number for rainfed crop y potential can also be interpreted as yield under full watered conditions while keeping the other field managements optimal y stress represented water limited potential yield in which y potential is additionally limited by seasonal water supply van ittersum et al 2013 therefore ylr aimed to quantify the effects of seasonal cumulative water stress on potential yield for impact assessment on top of average effects over a time series particular attentions should be paid to extreme events e g drought heatwave that can cause significant yield reductions therefore possible extreme events for cwsi and ylr were assessed over 1986 2015 based on the fixed exceeding probability of 5 and 20 year return periods respectively the return period calculation was based on the empirical cumulative distribution function fitted for each grid point over 1986 2015 2 4 4 evaluate the effects of shifting the phenophase flowering veraison water stress during the flowering veraison phase can represent a major contribution to total water stress effects ramos et al 2020 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 therefore it was of interest to examine if potential ylr can be reduced by alleviating the cwsi during this period specifically we have modified the calibrated phenology parameters for each grid point at which the required thermal demand gdd for flowering fl and veraison stage vr was simultaneously reduced by 5 15 25 respectively accordingly the phenophase between two stages was shifted earlier where the resulting advancements in days were calculated in vineyards this can be achieved by introducing different grapevine varieties 15 25 shift or different clones of the same variety 5 shift to preserve local wine typicity parker et al 2013 van leeuwen et al 2019 the difference for cwsi and ylr without and with the shifted phenophase was calculated respectively note for ylr only variations on y stress were considered while y potential remained constant equation 2 the mann whitney rank test mann and whitney 1947 was performed to assess if their distributions over 1986 2015 became different statistical significance at p 0 05 after the shifted phenophase consequently we estimated potential ylr as a function of mean cwsi over the flowering veraison phase to evaluate respective drought vulnerability 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological characteristics in major wine regions most of the studied wine regions were well confined within suitable viticulture regions worldwide defined by the isotherms of the mean seasonal temperature of 12 24 c schultz and jones 2010 however the mean seasonal april september temperature over 1986 2015 is markedly higher 16 22 c in i p s countries whereas it is lower 12 18 c in f g l countries fig 3a some wine regions in southern spain e g extremadura have a high seasonal temperature 22 c close to the upper boundary of optimal range fig 3a for mean seasonal total precipitation mm over 1986 2015 there are considerable spatial heterogeneities fig 3b precipitation 300 mm is generally observed in f g l countries whereas dry areas with precipitation 150 mm are identified in regions of i p s countries e g alentejo extremadura la mancha puglia sicily fig 3 b however precipitation between 300 and 600 mm is also found in areas in northwest portugal e g minho and northern italy e g friuli venezia giulia fig 3 b for the identified dry regions such as la mancha do impacts of severe water stress are already pronounced particularly during summer chacón vozmediano et al 2020 for the calculated chd and cdd they are generally 60 days for most of the wine regions in f g l countries fig 3 c d in contrast for southern mediterranean countries i p s chd and cdd are mostly 60 120 and 90 150 days respectively fig 3c d in central and southern spain chd can last for more than 4 months fig 3 c it is thus corroborating that regions with averagely warmer and drier climates are more prone to prolonged extreme events over 1986 2015 fig 3 extreme weather events such as heatwaves and dry spells are not only important in terms of frequency and intensity but also the continuousness that was shown to pose substantial threats to vineyard s productivity across europe fraga et al 2020 3 2 mean cwsi of the flowering veraison phase cwsi for mean cwsi cwsi for brevity the median and possible extreme values return period calculations are assessed over 1986 2015 fig 4a c the median values over 1986 2015 generally vary from 0 to 0 5 slight to moderate drought in f g l countries except some areas in southern france to 0 5 1 0 severe to extreme drought in i p s countries except some areas in northern italy and northwest portugal fig 4a rare cwsi events with 5 and 20 year return periods 20 and 5 chance of being exceeded in magnitude for any given year primarily correspond to widespread severe drought 0 5 and severe to extreme drought 0 625 respectively fig 4b c yet higher cwsi values are mostly found in i p s countries where extreme cwsi 0 75 is detected for most of the iberian peninsula fig 4b c the associated zonal average of each wine region shows an increase of drought severity from north to south within each country except for g l fig s7 overall wine regions prone to a high drought risk of the flowering veraison phase cwsi 0 75 hereafter drought prone regions are identified as those in iberian peninsula except north western portugal southern areas in france languedoc provence rhone and italy apulia sardinia sicily fig 4a c fig s7 among these regions cwsi is the highest 0 875 with extreme drought for wine regions in central and south eastern spain e g extremadura la mancha manchuela fig 4a c fig s7 these results can be mostly associated with the spatial pattern of precipitation during the flowering veraison phase which is particularly limited for those drought prone regions with median values 50 mm accompanied by strong inter annual variability cv 80 fig s8 notably these regions also have high cdd and chd fig 3c d which implies the absence of precipitation can frequently occur over the flowering veraison phase during which et is close to 0 i e cwsi close to 1 in most wine regions of spain fig s7 for rainfed mediterranean viticulture most of the berry growth and ripening periods are frequently exposed to conditions of high temperature and soil water deficits which are particularly pronounced for iberian peninsula chacón vozmediano et al 2020 costa et al 2016 in particular ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 highlighted water deficit was consistently more severe during bloom veraison period than in other growing phase for cabernet sauvignon in penedès do spain over 1998 2012 the overall spatial pattern of cwsi is consistent with that in fraga et al 2016 which simulated water stress index from fruit setting onset to maturity concluding that stronger water stress was mainly found in iberian peninsula and italy compared to the previous work we have additionally tried to consider sample spatial variations of local varieties in cwsi simulations as well as incorporating recent gridded datasets with a finer spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 however it shall be cautioned that cwsi calculations rely on the s w resistive model for estimating evapotranspiration which might require additional verifications but available lysimeter measurements with quality records are very scarce across these wine regions on the other hand since water stress can be associated with excessively high temperatures a previous analysis revealed most of these drought prone regions are also frequently exposed to detrimental impacts of heatwaves fraga et al 2020 3 3 potential ylr due to seasonal water stress ylr the quantified median ylr over 1986 2015 shows a similar spatial pattern as that of cwsi with higher ylr in i p s countries than in f g l countries fig 4 d the median ylr mainly varies at about 20 45 in italy 10 40 in portugal and 30 50 in spain to about 20 40 in france 10 30 in germany and negligible 5 in luxembourg fig 4 d and fig s9 rare ylr events with a 5 year return period mainly correspond to prevalent ylr at about 30 50 in i p s some areas 50 in spain and 20 40 in f g countries some areas 40 in southern france fig 4 e and fig s9 with a 20 year return period ylr mostly amounts to around or greater than 50 in i p s some areas 60 in spain whereas it is about 40 50 for most of france some southern areas 50 and generally 40 for germany fig 4 f fig s9 potential ylr is generally not important for the studied wine region in luxembourg with an extreme ylr of only around 20 fig s9 for the aforementioned drought prone regions the potential ylr is essentially around 30 60 close to 60 for rare events fig 4 d f and fig s9 these results reveal wine regions with stronger cwsi during flowering veraison phase tend to have higher potential ylr particularly for the identified drought prone regions fig 4 compared to observations the quantified median ylr is comparable to a recent meta analysis which reported approximately 7 45 reductions in berry weight of cabernet sauvignon merlot and tempranillo involved in our analysis under moderate to severe water deficits 1 4 ψstem 0 9 as compared to non stressed conditions gambetta et al 2020 in a mediterranean region northern italy wenter et al 2018 showed about 46 51 reductions in berry weight of sauvignon blanc between rainfed and full irrigated conditions however it shall be emphasized though grid based simulations already assimilate phenology data the growth parameters such as potential leaf growth and photosynthesis capacity are not adjusted locally to reflect yield response to water deficits at variety level thus some uncertainties exist in the simulated magnitudes of potential ylr 3 4 effects of shifting the flowering veraison phase over 1986 2015 3 4 1 advanced flowering and veraison stages the grid based phenology simulations driven by sited based observations of local varieties show the mean flowering and veraison doy are mostly 135 180 and 180 240 respectively fig s10 these ranges are in line with fraga et al 2016 who reported that flowering generally occurred from the 2nd week of may until the end of june while veraison occurred from the end of june to the end of august across major european wine regions in response to 5 15 25 advanced phenophase at each grid point median flowering doy is respectively advanced by 5 days 5 10 days 5 15 days throughout while median veraison doy is advanced by 5 days 5 20 days 10 30 days fig s10 the simulated magnitudes of these advancements can be achieved for example by introducing different cultivars as existing difference among cultivars already shows 16 and 31 days between earliest and latest for flowering and veraison stage respectively parker et al 2013 similarly van leeuwen et al 2019 also found the average veraison date can span up to 34 days among 52 grapevine varieties on the other hand under climate change with rising temperature all phenology stages are projected to occur earlier for both early and late varieties leolini et al 2018b ramos 2017 the flowering veraison phase is expected to be shortened which can have important implications on cwsi increased evaporative demand under a warmer climate but with a shorter time window for water stress consequently advanced phenology has important repercussions on wine quality because the grape composition can be unbalanced e g between sugar and polyphenols if grape achieves full ripeness in the warmest part of the season july august ramos and martinez de toda 2020 van leeuwen et al 2019 van leeuwen and seguin 2006 besides advanced phenology also implies a shorter growing phase with early maturity which can lead to changes in the sensation attribute e g more astringent wine due to inadequate ripeness garcía estévez et al 2017 minimal pruning or semi minimal pruned hedge can help delay the fruit maturity with improved fruit quality e g with increased anthocyanin concentration or higher degree of organic acids schäfer et al 2021 zheng et al 2017 however delayed fruit maturity might still be exposed to an increased frequency of high temperature episodes that could be extended from august to september under climate warming with increased incidence of fruit sunburns particularly in those southern mediterranean regions 3 4 2 variations of mean cwsi in flowering veraison period for median precipitation of the flowering veraison phase over 1986 2015 advanced phenology seems to result in an overall decrease 25 mm for f g l except some areas in southern france but a small increase 12 5 mm for i p s except some areas in northern italy and central spain countries respectively fig s8 these small median changes indeed result from strong inter annual variability of changes in flowering veraison precipitation with shifted phenophase fig s11 significant median changes of precipitation are only evident with 25 shifted phenophase primarily in germany significant less and southern spain significant more fig s8 across all wine regions it can have widespread decreases by up to 75 mm 5th percentile for a given year while having prevalent increases by up to 125 mm 95th percentile in another year fig s11 the 90 uncertainty range difference between 5th and 95th percentile over 1986 2015 for each grid point generally indicates a higher chance of precipitation gains 25 to 100 mm in the drought prone regions as compared to a range of 75 to 75 mm in f g l countries fig s11 the results suggest despite remarkably larger inter annual variability of flowering veraison precipitation in i p s 60 160 cv than in f g l 60 cv countries shown in fig s8 shifted phenophase still favours more precipitation in the former case this is mainly because precipitation is concentrated in autumn winter and spring seasons for southern mediterranean europe costa et al 2016 giorgi and lionello 2008 where a significant fraction of annual rainfall can occur before grapevine flowering stage ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 however this might not be effective for f g l countries with a relatively even seasonal precipitation distribution although increased precipitation during flowering veraison phase is not as important as that in i p s countries with respect to the effects of shifted phenophase on cwsi there are also considerable uncertainties across all wine regions fig s12 which can be mainly linking to the marked inter annual variability of flowering veraison precipitation fig s8 and fig s11 however cwsi shows a tendency of reductions by up to 0 2 for i p s countries but mainly with 25 shifted phenophase while being more uncertain 0 2 to 0 2 90 uncertainty range in f g l countries fig s12 as a result of inter annual variability median variations for cwsi over 1986 2015 primarily range from 0 05 to 0 05 across all wine regions fig 5 slight reductions alleviations of cwsi are detected throughout i p s countries and southern france in which statistical significances p 0 05 are only discovered under 25 shifted phenophase and mainly in those drought prone regions fig 5 e f in contrast slight increase in median cwsi is found for f g l countries but without statistical significance fig 5 it also should be emphasized that shifted phenophase could have led to cooler temperatures with reduced evaporative demand et max in wine regions of i p s thus contributing to reduced cwsi chacón vozmediano et al 2020 costa et al 2016 such effects can also be expected for those of f g l although the magnitude of cooling can be smaller than those in i p s not shown for the drought prone regions in i p s countries changes in the water deficits during the flowering veraison phase could especially affect the grape quality for not irrigated vines rainfall is the unique water input and the time in which it fells can affect the acidity and phenolic composition particularly in the context of global warming for instance in some of the spanish wine regions where most of vines are cultivated with red varieties and early phenology and without irrigation lower water deficits in the flowering veraison period favour an increase in acidity ramos et al 2015 while an increase in water deficits in this period favours an increase in anthocyanins ramos and martínez de toda 2020 these effects depending on how the water deficits can vary could potentially balance the decreases on grape quality parameters that are induced by anticipated higher temperatures consequently the effects of flowering veraison water deficits on grapevine quality parameters will be dependent on the locations ramos and martínez de toda 2020 and the varieties 3 4 3 variations of potential ylr advanced phenophase seems to result in widespread reductions alleviations in potential ylr throughout all studied wine regions fig 6 reductions of statistical significance are simulated for 15 and 25 shifted phenophase hence this indicates positive effects on water limited potential yield see section 2 4 4 for i p s countries especially for the drought prone regions the median reductions on ylr are generally moderate 15 i e moderate increase of water limited potential yields fig 6 it is also accompanied by considerable inter annual variability where the 90 uncertainty range is between 20 and 40 fig s13 for f g l countries significant median reductions of ylr mainly correspond to 5 20 under 15 and 25 shifted phenophase fig 6 c f the respective upper 95th percentile indicates ylr can be potentially reduced by up to 80 e g in germany fig s13 lastly a linear negative relationship is found between cwsi and water limited potential yield both without and with shifted phenophase fig s14 clearly this relationship depends on the year and annual climate conditions fig s14 yet it is consistently found shifted phenophase can lead to increased yield sensitivities to drought stress which is evidenced by increased slope values of linear regressions without and with 25 shifted phenophase the estimated potential cluster weight yield reductions as per 0 1 increase in cwsi are 29 49 g and 33 59 g 90 uncertainty range over 1986 2015 respectively fig s14 these results suggest advanced phenology tends to have positive effects for water limited potential yield for most wine regions which are more effective with 25 shifted phenophase the flowering verasion phase represents a crucial period for yield responses to water stress which has been observed in the fields chacón vozmediano et al 2020 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 and successfully reflected in our simulations fig s14 gaudin et al 2014 explicitly report the negative linear relationship between flowering veraison water stress and berry weight for i p s countries especially for drought prone regions the overall moderate increase of water limited potential yield can be associated with the shifted phenophase towards a wetter and cooler period leading to small but significantly reduced cwsi fig 5 e f these beneficial effects can outweigh the negative impacts on potential yield associated with reduced growth season length i e early ripening and maturity with advanced phenophase however for f g l countries increases of water limited potential yield can be mainly owing to the shifted growing phase not only flowering veraison period towards a cooler climate with reduced evaporative demand along the season this can partly offset the adverse effects on yield due to reduced growing length and flowering veraison precipitation fig s8 it is also because water stress is overall less pronounced in these wine regions fig 4 thus reduced precipitation with advanced phenology has less influence in addition for these regions such as bordeaux moselle rheinhessen advanced phenophase can help avoid crop exposure to possible heatwave peaks during the ripening period fraga et al 2020 despite generally potential yield gains with shifted phenophase drought sensitivities are increased this is possibly attributed to a shorter growing season with less time for photosynthesis and biomass accumulation where plant growth and yield formation becomes more sensitive and vulnerable to water stress van ittersum et al 2013 on the other hand the linear relationship between cwsi and water limited potential yield is shown to vary with annual climate conditions it can also depend on genotypic characteristics gaudin et al 2014 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 which should be further distinguished in subsequent studies 4 conclusion the present study essentially is a retrospective analysis for important wine regions in six different european countries over 1986 2015 the analysis focuses on estimating the mean crop water stress indicator cwsi during a drought sensitive flowering veraison period cwsi for brevity and potential yield loss rate ylr yield refers to cluster weight resulting from cumulative seasonal water stress our findings suggest wine regions prone to a high drought risk cwsi 0 75 are identified as those in iberian peninsula except north western portugal southern italy apulia sardinia sicily and southern france languedoc provence rhone the corresponding ylr can range from 30 to 60 in general wine regions with stronger cwsi during flowering veraison phase tend to have higher ylr however contrasting patterns are found between wine regions in france germany luxembourg and italy portugal spain which highlights the spatial complexity and contextual dependent nature for viticulture in the former case the test of advanced flowering veraison phase suggests advanced phenology could have benefited from cooler temperatures and a higher fraction of spring precipitation resulting in alleviated cwsi with moderate reductions of ylr conversely this may result in decreased flowering veraison precipitation with more uncertain effects on cwsi in those of france germany luxembourg however since water stress in these regions is generally less severe than those in southern mediterranean europe the shifted phenology towards a cooler season might also lead to increased potential yields i e reduced ylr in extreme years nevertheless effects of shifted phenophase are subject to uncertainties across all wine regions which might be associated with the strong inter annual variability of local precipitation overall we demonstrate the flowering verasion water availability can be critical to potential vineyard productivity which is dependent on local soil and climate conditions and genoptyic characteristics with global warming such phenophase is expected to be advanced the obtained positive effects on water stress reductions and potential yields under past conditions depending on the magnitude of warming can be reversed for local vineyards such a trade off due to interactions between shifting a drought sensitive phase into a relatively cooler and wetter growing season and changes in local temperature and precipitation patterns should be explicitly considered in climate impact assessment studies on the other hand the underlying implications on grapevine quality parameters are more complex and should be further examined such a retrospective analysis might provide new insights towards better management of seasonal water deficit for conventionally vulnerable mediterranean wine regions but also for relatively cooler and wetter central european regions where water stress is becoming increasingly important

9752,in europe most of vineyards are managed under rainfed conditions where water deficit has become increasingly an issue the flowering veraison phenophase represents an important period for vine response to water stress which is known to depend on variety characteristics soil and climate conditions in this paper we have carried out a retrospective analysis for important european wine regions over 1986 2015 with objectives to assess the mean crop water stress indicator cwsi during flowering veraison phase and potential yield lose rate ylr due to seasonal cumulative water stress moreover we also investigate if advanced flowering veraison phase can lead to alleviated cwsi under recent past conditions thus contributing to reduced ylr a process based grapevine model is employed which has been extensively calibrated for simulating both flowering and veraison stages using location specific observations representing 10 different varieties subsequently grid based modelling is implemented with gridded climate and soil datasets and calibrated phenology parameters the findings suggest wine regions with higher mean cwsi of flowering veraison phase tend to have higher potential ylr however contrasting patterns are found between wine regions in france germany luxembourg and italy portugal spain the former tends to have slight to moderate drought conditions cwsi 0 5 along with a negligible to moderate ylr 30 whereas the latter is found to have severe to extreme drought cwsi 0 5 and substantial ylr 40 wine regions prone to a high drought risk cwsi 0 75 are also identified which are concentrated in southern mediterranean europe advanced flowering veraison phase over 1986 2015 could have benefited from more spring precipitation and cooler temperatures for wine regions of italy portugal spain leading to reduced mean cwsi and ylr for those of france germany luxembourg this can have reduced flowering veraison precipitation but prevalent reductions of ylr are also found possibly due to shifted phase towards a cooler growing season with reduced evaporative demands our study demonstrates flowering verasion water deficit is critical for potential yield which can have different impacts between central and southern european wine regions this phase can be advanced under a warmer climate thus having important implications for european rainfed vineyards the overall outcome may provide new insights for appropriate viticultural management of seasonal water deficits under climate change keywords grapevine modelling drought stress yield gap phenology network stics regional crop modelling 1 introduction grapevine vitis vinifera is a major fruit crop of economic importance worldwide europe is the world leader in wine production which accounts for about 63 of world wine production in 2020 oiv 2021 most of the winegrowing regions in europe are currently cultivated under rainfed conditions with only 10 of vineyards irrigated as a consequence of policy restriction e g regulation rules in denominations of origin do and concerns for sustainable water use costa et al 2016 for rainfed viticulture water deficit stress has become increasingly an issue even in relatively cooler and wetter european countries such as france germany and luxembourg santos et al 2020 van leeuwen et al 2019 this can be possibly attributed to the rising temperatures in the last decades accompanied by more extreme weather events such as heatwaves fraga et al 2020 accordingly the evapotranspiration from plant and soil has increased which results in increasingly negative soil water balance van leeuwen et al 2019 in southern mediterranean countries such as italy portugal spain vine growth is frequently exposed to drought stress leading to reductions in yield and if with severe water stress impaired wine quality attributes costa et al 2016 van leeuwen et al 2018 in these wine regions water deficit combined with high temperatures in summer during the berry ripening period can represent a major limiting factor for vineyard productivity chacón vozmediano et al 2020 costa et al 2016 moreover water deficits can be further exacerbated under climate change in terms of frequency and intensity which can be particularly pronounced in currently most vulnerable regions e g southern mediterranean regions costa et al 2016 giorgi and lionello 2008 santos et al 2020 mild or moderate water deficits generally favour the berry accumulation of sugar and some phenolics e g anthocyanin whereas severe water stresses can lead to significantly reduced berry quality sugar aroma and grape yield van leeuwen et al 2018 2009 the effect of water availability varies with the variety limited water supply can increase skin phenolics e g anthocyanins which is crucial for the production of high quality red grapes whereas this may negatively affect the aromas of white grapes van leeuwen et al 2019 2018 however the effects of water deficit also depend on its timing and duration gambetta et al 2020 before veraison berries are hydraulically connected to vine and are sensitive to drought induced shrivelling but they are largely insensitive at after veraison since berries become buffered from changes in vine s water status gambetta et al 2020 water shortage before veraison can have strong negative impacts on leaf growth berry weight and final yield per vine chacón vozmediano et al 2020 gambetta et al 2020 van leeuwen et al 2018 wenter et al 2018 one of the most important pre veraison phenophase corresponds to the flowering veraison phase which proves to be an important period for berry weight and yield determinations chacón vozmediano et al 2020 gaudin et al 2014 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 for instance ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 found grape yield to be particularly sensitive to water availability of bloom veraison period during which a yield increase of about 46 kg ha per mm water input is observed therefore it is of importance to focus on how to increase water availability and mitigate possible water stress over this period while not using irrigation when it is restricted in southern mediterranean countries it is presumed an early occurrence of this phase can benefit from higher precipitations as a considerable fraction of annual precipitation can occur between bud break and flowering period ramos et al 2020 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 besides advanced flowering veraison phase can reduce crop exposure to extreme high summer temperature that frequently exceeds 35 c in these regions giorgi and lionello 2008 yang et al 2018 however the magnitudes of these effects on alleviating water stress of flowering veraison period are not quantified to our knowledge especially over a large geographic area moreover the potential impacts of such shifted phenophase in those relatively cooler and wetter european wine regions are yet to be well understood to determine the level of water deficit experienced by plants measurements of leaf water potential at pre dawn ψpd and midday ψmid and the stem water potentials ψstem are often carried out which are standard field methods to monitor vine water status van leeuwen et al 2018 2009 although these are useful plant water stress indicators they need frequent field measurements to obtain meaningful results which are often laborious and costly as an alternative an empirical crop water stress indicator cwsi developed by idso et al 1981 and jackson 1982 is also frequently applied to diagnose vine water status by relating the difference of canopy air temperature to the air vapor pressure deficit of a non water stressed baseline bellvert et al 2015 cwsi can be conveniently estimated from remote sensed thermal image data which can allow us to accurately monitor vine water status throughout the growing season bellvert et al 2015 however to develop appropriate guidelines or agricultural policies for better management of seasonal water deficits water stress indicators like cwsi need to be applied at the regional level to consider possible differences between vineyards in soil properties and climate conditions for this purpose several studies have applied biophysical models to simulate cwsi for example to monitor drought variability over the koshi river basin in central asia wu et al 2019 or for constructing the drought vulnerability curve for six main maize growing regions in china zhu et al 2021 process based crop models have proven to be useful tools to simulate the complex interactions among genotypes management and environment g m e and their impacts on desired outputs e g water use and yield coucheney et al 2015 rötter et al 2018 the advantages of model derived water stress indicators are being continuous over the season which allow comparison between sites with different environmental conditions by coupling with high resolution gridded datasets these models can be implemented at regional level to simulate crop water status and water stress conditions taking into account genotype dependent crop response to water deficits while integrating the effects of site dependent climate variability and soil characteristics ceglar et al 2019 fraga et al 2016 zhu et al 2021 some of these models that have been successfully adapted to grapevine are unifi grapeml leolini et al 2018a phenologyvv stock et al 2007 uniphen molitor et al 2020 and stics brisson et al 2009 garcía de cortázar atauri 2006 in particular fraga et al 2015 and valdés gómez et al 2009 have demonstrated a good agreement between water stress indices simulated by stics and those measured in the field ψpd and ψmid stics has also extensively shown its capacities in reliably simulating soil water content plant water stress phenology and yield for grapevine under various environmental conditions coucheney et al 2015 fraga et al 2016 2015 valdés gómez et al 2009 for regional model applications phenology parameters are the most common parameters to be calibrated adjusted angulo et al 2013 ceglar et al 2019 particularly for simulating phenology dependent water stress besides reliable phenology simulations can also contribute to improving estimations of potential yield that is closely related to the length of the growing season van ittersum et al 2013 for winegrowers it is not always beneficial to pursue higher yields because they can compromise wine quality but a reasonable production level should be safeguarded for wine growing estates to be economically sustainable therefore it is of practical importance to understand and quantify to what extent the seasonal water stress can impose limitations on potentially attainable yields especially to evaluate the role of a drought sensitive period i e flowering veraison phase ramos et al 2020 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 such yield gap analysis is often carried out for annual field crops like wheat and maize van ittersum et al 2013 it is however rarely performed for grapevine as overall more attention is given to quality attributes hence our study may contribute to fill the gap in this regard in europe the leading five wine producing countries are italy 49 1 million hectoliter i e mhl france 46 6 mhl spain 40 7 mhl germany 8 4 mhl and portugal 6 4 mhl respectively oiv 2021 these countries together account for about 58 of world wine production in 2020 with a total exported wine worth 19 billion euros oiv 2021 adequate production of high quality wines plays an important role in the local economy therefore these countries were chosen in our analysis additionally we have added luxembourg that shares a wider wine region with germany the moselle valley important wine regions are identified within these countries accordingly for these wine regions over a study period of 1986 2015 we aim to i assess vine drought stress conditions exclusively during the flowering veraison phase using cwsi that is constructed from model simulation outputs ii assess the potential yield lose rate ylr due to seasonal cumulative water stress yield refers to mean cluster weight at harvest the possible link between cwsi and ylr is also analyzed lastly as a retrospective analysis we also aim to iii investigate if shifted flowering veraison phase can lead to both alleviated cwsi and ylr under recent past conditions 2 data and methods 2 1 workflow summary an extensive site based model calibration is performed using stics model across studied wine regions before being up scaled to regional level with grid based simulations for cwsi and potential ylr over 1986 2015 based on the setup we also investigated potential impacts of early shifted flowering veraison phase a schematic overview of the workflow is presented in fig 1 which will be described in details in subsequent sections 2 2 studied wine regions and selected sites in europe the major wine regions in the studied six european countries were identified fig 2 in accordance with those in fraga et al 2020 previous analysis revealed several wine regions in france germany and luxembourg tended to be vulnerable to heatwave fraga et al 2020 however they are yet to be selected for a drought impact analysis which are often connected with high temperature episodes on the other hand southern mediterranean europe such as italy portugal and spain were already exposed to increasingly warmer and drier climate accompanied by more frequent and longer weather extremes costa et al 2016 mediterranean region was projected to be one of the meteorological drought hot spots giorgi and lionello 2008 across these wine regions 38 sites were selected fig 2 where the flowering bbch65 and veraison data bbch81 were obtained for 10 different grapevine varieties representing locally dominant varieties table s1 the data was mainly collected within the framework of the clim4vitis project https clim4vitis eu from vineyard based observations but also complemented by data from the pan european phenology project pep725 templ et al 2018 and from the italian phenological network iphen mariani et al 2013 however it shall be emphasized that pep725 data lacked specific variety information for our selected sites while iphen data generally covered short periods observed data was only used for calibration when fulfilled the following criteria 1 data was measured within the study period 1986 2015 and 2 flowering and veraison stages were recorded in the same year except sites with only flowering or veraison data detailed information on the site coordinates and names related varieties data length and source were summarized in table s1 2 3 stics grapevine modules this section presented stics grapevine modules v9 2 that were most relevant in this study while a more comprehensive presentation of the model structure and formalisms can be found in several other studies brisson et al 2003 2009 garcía de cortázar atauri et al 2009a b garcía de cortázar atauri 2006 2 3 1 phenology module the phenophase between dormancy onset and budbreak was simulated using the brin model which successively calculated the period from dormancy onset to dormancy break and from dormancy break to budbreak garcía de cortázar atauri et al 2009a the dormancy period calculation was based on bidabe s cold action model bidabe 1965 taking into account the genotype dependent chilling requirement expressed as chilling units or effective dormancy days dd the post dormancy period after dormancy break was calculated based on richardson s chilling hour units richardson et al 1974 with cardinal temperatures defined to limit the function of a linear response a critical sum of growing degree hours pd post dormancy thermal requirement was considered and assumed to be genotype dependent the subsequent stages such as flowering veraison and fruit maturity were all simulated using the classic growing degree day gdd celsius degree day model with a 10 base temperature brisson et al 2009 the flowering stage was mainly controlled by two parameters which defined budbreak to fruit setting and flowering to fruit setting period respectively the former one was generally a sensitive parameter with substantial influence on other simulation outputs e g lai biomass and yield whereas the latter one was only built for additional adjustment of flowering stage without any effects on the other processes brisson et al 2009 thus we only chose to calibrate the gdd requirement between the budbreak and fruit setting onset which was denoted as fl for the veraison onset the parameter for gdd requirement between the end of juvenile phase and veraison onset was chosen for calibration defined as vr these phenology parameters are all genotype dependent 2 3 2 water use module soil water balance simulations represented an essential component of soil crop system modeling the resulting simulated maximum et max and actual evapotranspiration et largely determine the soil water content and the crop water stress conditions which in turn affects the potential canopy growth biomass accumulation and yield at harvest the et max can be divided into maximum soil evaporation e max and crop transpiration t max for grapevine the e max was estimated by available energy in the soil surface following the energy balance approach brisson et al 2009 cf supplementary material for details the actual soil evaporation e was calculated by a semi empirical model developed by brisson and perrier 1991 soil evaporation is maximum e max until reaching a cumulative threshold estimated by particle size distribution then e is calculated considering the soil type weather influence and most importantly the actual soil water availability brisson et al 2009 t max represents the crop water requirement which was calculated using the shuttleworth and wallace s w model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 s w is a resistance model that characterizes the soil plant atmosphere system with a resistance network which proved to be effective in explaining the canopy energy budget brisson et al 1998 the advantage of using the s w model consists in its ability to consider the influence of soil evaporation on t max whereas this is absent in other approaches e g dual crop coefficient allen et al 1998 however s w is a complex model holding many parameters and assumptions while a variety of input data on meteorology and crop characteristics e g canopy height is required brisson et al 1998 cf supplementary material for detailed t max calculations the actual transpiration t is calculated based on the available soil water content in the root zone crop transpiration is at the maximum rate t max unless the available soil water content is below a certain threshold such threshold was calculated at a daily time step depending on the root density a plant stomatal function and t max brisson et al 2009 the ratio t t max was computed as the crop water stress index which was shown to be closely correlated with measured ψpd and ψmid with a variety dependent r2 up to 0 89 and 0 94 respectively fraga et al 2015 valdés gómez et al 2009 2 3 3 yield module yield formation was essentially a process of dry matter allocation to fruits during the fruit setting to maturity period a boxcar train technique was applied to account for the asynchronous nature of berry maturation with the concept of fruit age class number of artificially imposed berry growth compartments goudriaan and van roermund 1993 it attempted to mimic the physiological changes occurring over the berry ripening process for each compartment the berry growth a dry matter allocation coefficient was differently calculated depending on the number of setting berries potential berry growth rate cell division and expansion and possibly any abiotic stress effects garcía de cortázar atauri et al 2009b 2 4 simulation setup 2 4 1 automatic model calibrations at selected 38 sites the purpose of the phenology calibration partial calibration was to partly account for sampling the considerable spatial variabilities of genotypes used in these wine regions for each study site fig 2 and table s1 the four phenology parameters explained in section 2 3 1 were calibrated a range was predefined for each of these parameters dd 40 205 pd 6000 11500 fl 230 560 and vr 600 1700 these ranges generally covered a large genotypic variability garcía de cortázar atauri 2006 which were evenly sampled with 11 intervals per parameter resulting in a total of 20 000 parameter combinations tested per site parameter induced variations represented a major source of uncertainties in crop model simulations while estimations of best fit parameters rely on a clearly outlined calibration approach seidel et al 2018 wallach et al 2011 we estimated parameter values by minimizing the sum of mean squared error mse between observations and simulations over the two successive stages following the ordinary least square approach wallach et al 2011 previous analysis revealed that minimizing the sum of mse was an appropriate goodness of fit criterion particularly when there were multiple measurements over time in the same plot containing prediction error correlation and heteroscedasticity wallach et al 2011 however when only flowering or veraison data was available total 8 sites the mse was minimized for a single stage accordingly following the model calibration the goodness of fit between observations and simulations with estimated parameters were evaluated using mean biased errors mbe mean absolute errors mae root mean squared errors rmse and pearson correlation coefficient r refer to yang et al 2021 for more details on the overall calibration approach the calibrated parameters shown in fig s1 can generally well reproduce the inter annual variability of observed data with negligible mean bias fig s2 s6 detailed description of overall calibration results including the goodness of fit between observations and simulations for each site was presented in the supplementary material 2 4 2 input data for grid based simulations grid based simulations were feed with inputs from estimated phenology parameters from the closest measured by euclidean distance calibration site and from gridded climate soil and terrain datasets fig 1 the required daily surface temperature c and precipitation sum mm were directly obtained from the recent release of the e obs dataset v22 0e at an enhanced resolution of 0 1 0 1 cornes et al 2018 mean seasonal april september temperature c and precipitation sum mm were calculated over 1986 2015 besides we also calculated maximum consecutive

hourly 10 m wind speed was firstly calculated from respective zonal and meridional wind components before being adjusted to the standard 2 m height following logarithmic profile allen et al 1998 daily mean vapor pressure was estimated from the dew point temperature at daily minimum and maximum with the exponential function allen et al 1998 for soil inputs some important soil properties such as soil

gridded soil datasets were assimilated into stics is available in yang et al 2020 by overlaying the climatic grids soil and terrain maps the simulation unit was determined at a regular grid of 0 1 0 1 resolution taking into account the trade off between accuracy in resolving spatial gradients and computation workloads avoid excessive and repetitive soil information appearing within a given climatic grid it was noteworthy the gridded data was also used for aforementioned site based calibrations 2 4 3 assessing the cwsi and ylr over 1986 2015 mean cwsi of the flowering veraison phase hereafter cwsi was computed at each grid point for each year over 1986 2015 the cwsi was computed according to zhu et al 2021 1 cwsi 1 et et max where et and et max were daily model outputs with detailed calculation procedures explained in section 2 3 2 it integrated the effect of climate soil and crop characteristics which has been widely applied for drought monitoring and assessment wu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 according to wu et al 2019 cwsi can be divided into four categories 0 0 25 as slight drought 0 25 0 5 as moderate drought 0 5 0 75 as severe drought and 0 75 1 as extreme drought wu et al 2019 similar to zhu et al 2021 cwsi was calculated as the mean instead of sum over a target phase with the advantages to preserve its physical meanings and allow comparison of drought intensities among regions the potential ylr was also simulated for each grid over 1986 2015 which in accordance with zhu et al 2021 was computed as follow 2 ylr 1 y stress y potential 100 where y stress and y potential were the potential cluster weight g at harvest simulated with and without water stress respectively to reduce uncertainties of spatial simulations associated with heterogeneous vineyard managements we focused only on mean cluster weight g at harvest hereafter referred to as yield the advantage was to avoid the need to specify the other two yield components local planting density vines ha and mean harvestable cluster numbers per vine dependent on the variety training system and viticulture practices y potential represented potentially attainable yield in absence of any abiotic and biotic stresses together with optimum farming practices van ittersum et al 2013 it is only affected by seasonal temperature radiation co2 level and crop genetic traits e g potential fruit size number for rainfed crop y potential can also be interpreted as yield under full watered conditions while keeping the other field managements optimal y stress represented water limited potential yield in which y potential is additionally limited by seasonal water supply van ittersum et al 2013 therefore ylr aimed to quantify the effects of seasonal cumulative water stress on potential yield for impact assessment on top of average effects over a time series particular attentions should be paid to extreme events e g drought heatwave that can cause significant yield reductions therefore possible extreme events for cwsi and ylr were assessed over 1986 2015 based on the fixed exceeding probability of 5 and 20 year return periods respectively the return period calculation was based on the empirical cumulative distribution function fitted for each grid point over 1986 2015 2 4 4 evaluate the effects of shifting the phenophase flowering veraison water stress during the flowering veraison phase can represent a major contribution to total water stress effects ramos et al 2020 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 therefore it was of interest to examine if potential ylr can be reduced by alleviating the cwsi during this period specifically we have modified the calibrated phenology parameters for each grid point at which the required thermal demand gdd for flowering fl and veraison stage vr was simultaneously reduced by 5 15 25 respectively accordingly the phenophase between two stages was shifted earlier where the resulting advancements in days were calculated in vineyards this can be achieved by introducing different grapevine varieties 15 25 shift or different clones of the same variety 5 shift to preserve local wine typicity parker et al 2013 van leeuwen et al 2019 the difference for cwsi and ylr without and with the shifted phenophase was calculated respectively note for ylr only variations on y stress were considered while y potential remained constant equation 2 the mann whitney rank test mann and whitney 1947 was performed to assess if their distributions over 1986 2015 became different statistical significance at p 0 05 after the shifted phenophase consequently we estimated potential ylr as a function of mean cwsi over the flowering veraison phase to evaluate respective drought vulnerability 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological characteristics in major wine regions most of the studied wine regions were well confined within suitable viticulture regions worldwide defined by the isotherms of the mean seasonal temperature of 12 24 c schultz and jones 2010 however the mean seasonal april september temperature over 1986 2015 is markedly higher 16 22 c in i p s countries whereas it is lower 12 18 c in f g l countries fig 3a some wine regions in southern spain e g extremadura have a high seasonal temperature 22 c close to the upper boundary of optimal range fig 3a for mean seasonal total precipitation mm over 1986 2015 there are considerable spatial heterogeneities fig 3b precipitation 300 mm is generally observed in f g l countries whereas dry areas with precipitation 150 mm are identified in regions of i p s countries e g alentejo extremadura la mancha puglia sicily fig 3 b however precipitation between 300 and 600 mm is also found in areas in northwest portugal e g minho and northern italy e g friuli venezia giulia fig 3 b for the identified dry regions such as la mancha do impacts of severe water stress are already pronounced particularly during summer chacón vozmediano et al 2020 for the calculated chd and cdd they are generally 60 days for most of the wine regions in f g l countries fig 3 c d in contrast for southern mediterranean countries i p s chd and cdd are mostly 60 120 and 90 150 days respectively fig 3c d in central and southern spain chd can last for more than 4 months fig 3 c it is thus corroborating that regions with averagely warmer and drier climates are more prone to prolonged extreme events over 1986 2015 fig 3 extreme weather events such as heatwaves and dry spells are not only important in terms of frequency and intensity but also the continuousness that was shown to pose substantial threats to vineyard s productivity across europe fraga et al 2020 3 2 mean cwsi of the flowering veraison phase cwsi for mean cwsi cwsi for brevity the median and possible extreme values return period calculations are assessed over 1986 2015 fig 4a c the median values over 1986 2015 generally vary from 0 to 0 5 slight to moderate drought in f g l countries except some areas in southern france to 0 5 1 0 severe to extreme drought in i p s countries except some areas in northern italy and northwest portugal fig 4a rare cwsi events with 5 and 20 year return periods 20 and 5 chance of being exceeded in magnitude for any given year primarily correspond to widespread severe drought 0 5 and severe to extreme drought 0 625 respectively fig 4b c yet higher cwsi values are mostly found in i p s countries where extreme cwsi 0 75 is detected for most of the iberian peninsula fig 4b c the associated zonal average of each wine region shows an increase of drought severity from north to south within each country except for g l fig s7 overall wine regions prone to a high drought risk of the flowering veraison phase cwsi 0 75 hereafter drought prone regions are identified as those in iberian peninsula except north western portugal southern areas in france languedoc provence rhone and italy apulia sardinia sicily fig 4a c fig s7 among these regions cwsi is the highest 0 875 with extreme drought for wine regions in central and south eastern spain e g extremadura la mancha manchuela fig 4a c fig s7 these results can be mostly associated with the spatial pattern of precipitation during the flowering veraison phase which is particularly limited for those drought prone regions with median values 50 mm accompanied by strong inter annual variability cv 80 fig s8 notably these regions also have high cdd and chd fig 3c d which implies the absence of precipitation can frequently occur over the flowering veraison phase during which et is close to 0 i e cwsi close to 1 in most wine regions of spain fig s7 for rainfed mediterranean viticulture most of the berry growth and ripening periods are frequently exposed to conditions of high temperature and soil water deficits which are particularly pronounced for iberian peninsula chacón vozmediano et al 2020 costa et al 2016 in particular ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 highlighted water deficit was consistently more severe during bloom veraison period than in other growing phase for cabernet sauvignon in penedès do spain over 1998 2012 the overall spatial pattern of cwsi is consistent with that in fraga et al 2016 which simulated water stress index from fruit setting onset to maturity concluding that stronger water stress was mainly found in iberian peninsula and italy compared to the previous work we have additionally tried to consider sample spatial variations of local varieties in cwsi simulations as well as incorporating recent gridded datasets with a finer spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 however it shall be cautioned that cwsi calculations rely on the s w resistive model for estimating evapotranspiration which might require additional verifications but available lysimeter measurements with quality records are very scarce across these wine regions on the other hand since water stress can be associated with excessively high temperatures a previous analysis revealed most of these drought prone regions are also frequently exposed to detrimental impacts of heatwaves fraga et al 2020 3 3 potential ylr due to seasonal water stress ylr the quantified median ylr over 1986 2015 shows a similar spatial pattern as that of cwsi with higher ylr in i p s countries than in f g l countries fig 4 d the median ylr mainly varies at about 20 45 in italy 10 40 in portugal and 30 50 in spain to about 20 40 in france 10 30 in germany and negligible 5 in luxembourg fig 4 d and fig s9 rare ylr events with a 5 year return period mainly correspond to prevalent ylr at about 30 50 in i p s some areas 50 in spain and 20 40 in f g countries some areas 40 in southern france fig 4 e and fig s9 with a 20 year return period ylr mostly amounts to around or greater than 50 in i p s some areas 60 in spain whereas it is about 40 50 for most of france some southern areas 50 and generally 40 for germany fig 4 f fig s9 potential ylr is generally not important for the studied wine region in luxembourg with an extreme ylr of only around 20 fig s9 for the aforementioned drought prone regions the potential ylr is essentially around 30 60 close to 60 for rare events fig 4 d f and fig s9 these results reveal wine regions with stronger cwsi during flowering veraison phase tend to have higher potential ylr particularly for the identified drought prone regions fig 4 compared to observations the quantified median ylr is comparable to a recent meta analysis which reported approximately 7 45 reductions in berry weight of cabernet sauvignon merlot and tempranillo involved in our analysis under moderate to severe water deficits 1 4 ψstem 0 9 as compared to non stressed conditions gambetta et al 2020 in a mediterranean region northern italy wenter et al 2018 showed about 46 51 reductions in berry weight of sauvignon blanc between rainfed and full irrigated conditions however it shall be emphasized though grid based simulations already assimilate phenology data the growth parameters such as potential leaf growth and photosynthesis capacity are not adjusted locally to reflect yield response to water deficits at variety level thus some uncertainties exist in the simulated magnitudes of potential ylr 3 4 effects of shifting the flowering veraison phase over 1986 2015 3 4 1 advanced flowering and veraison stages the grid based phenology simulations driven by sited based observations of local varieties show the mean flowering and veraison doy are mostly 135 180 and 180 240 respectively fig s10 these ranges are in line with fraga et al 2016 who reported that flowering generally occurred from the 2nd week of may until the end of june while veraison occurred from the end of june to the end of august across major european wine regions in response to 5 15 25 advanced phenophase at each grid point median flowering doy is respectively advanced by 5 days 5 10 days 5 15 days throughout while median veraison doy is advanced by 5 days 5 20 days 10 30 days fig s10 the simulated magnitudes of these advancements can be achieved for example by introducing different cultivars as existing difference among cultivars already shows 16 and 31 days between earliest and latest for flowering and veraison stage respectively parker et al 2013 similarly van leeuwen et al 2019 also found the average veraison date can span up to 34 days among 52 grapevine varieties on the other hand under climate change with rising temperature all phenology stages are projected to occur earlier for both early and late varieties leolini et al 2018b ramos 2017 the flowering veraison phase is expected to be shortened which can have important implications on cwsi increased evaporative demand under a warmer climate but with a shorter time window for water stress consequently advanced phenology has important repercussions on wine quality because the grape composition can be unbalanced e g between sugar and polyphenols if grape achieves full ripeness in the warmest part of the season july august ramos and martinez de toda 2020 van leeuwen et al 2019 van leeuwen and seguin 2006 besides advanced phenology also implies a shorter growing phase with early maturity which can lead to changes in the sensation attribute e g more astringent wine due to inadequate ripeness garcía estévez et al 2017 minimal pruning or semi minimal pruned hedge can help delay the fruit maturity with improved fruit quality e g with increased anthocyanin concentration or higher degree of organic acids schäfer et al 2021 zheng et al 2017 however delayed fruit maturity might still be exposed to an increased frequency of high temperature episodes that could be extended from august to september under climate warming with increased incidence of fruit sunburns particularly in those southern mediterranean regions 3 4 2 variations of mean cwsi in flowering veraison period for median precipitation of the flowering veraison phase over 1986 2015 advanced phenology seems to result in an overall decrease 25 mm for f g l except some areas in southern france but a small increase 12 5 mm for i p s except some areas in northern italy and central spain countries respectively fig s8 these small median changes indeed result from strong inter annual variability of changes in flowering veraison precipitation with shifted phenophase fig s11 significant median changes of precipitation are only evident with 25 shifted phenophase primarily in germany significant less and southern spain significant more fig s8 across all wine regions it can have widespread decreases by up to 75 mm 5th percentile for a given year while having prevalent increases by up to 125 mm 95th percentile in another year fig s11 the 90 uncertainty range difference between 5th and 95th percentile over 1986 2015 for each grid point generally indicates a higher chance of precipitation gains 25 to 100 mm in the drought prone regions as compared to a range of 75 to 75 mm in f g l countries fig s11 the results suggest despite remarkably larger inter annual variability of flowering veraison precipitation in i p s 60 160 cv than in f g l 60 cv countries shown in fig s8 shifted phenophase still favours more precipitation in the former case this is mainly because precipitation is concentrated in autumn winter and spring seasons for southern mediterranean europe costa et al 2016 giorgi and lionello 2008 where a significant fraction of annual rainfall can occur before grapevine flowering stage ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 however this might not be effective for f g l countries with a relatively even seasonal precipitation distribution although increased precipitation during flowering veraison phase is not as important as that in i p s countries with respect to the effects of shifted phenophase on cwsi there are also considerable uncertainties across all wine regions fig s12 which can be mainly linking to the marked inter annual variability of flowering veraison precipitation fig s8 and fig s11 however cwsi shows a tendency of reductions by up to 0 2 for i p s countries but mainly with 25 shifted phenophase while being more uncertain 0 2 to 0 2 90 uncertainty range in f g l countries fig s12 as a result of inter annual variability median variations for cwsi over 1986 2015 primarily range from 0 05 to 0 05 across all wine regions fig 5 slight reductions alleviations of cwsi are detected throughout i p s countries and southern france in which statistical significances p 0 05 are only discovered under 25 shifted phenophase and mainly in those drought prone regions fig 5 e f in contrast slight increase in median cwsi is found for f g l countries but without statistical significance fig 5 it also should be emphasized that shifted phenophase could have led to cooler temperatures with reduced evaporative demand et max in wine regions of i p s thus contributing to reduced cwsi chacón vozmediano et al 2020 costa et al 2016 such effects can also be expected for those of f g l although the magnitude of cooling can be smaller than those in i p s not shown for the drought prone regions in i p s countries changes in the water deficits during the flowering veraison phase could especially affect the grape quality for not irrigated vines rainfall is the unique water input and the time in which it fells can affect the acidity and phenolic composition particularly in the context of global warming for instance in some of the spanish wine regions where most of vines are cultivated with red varieties and early phenology and without irrigation lower water deficits in the flowering veraison period favour an increase in acidity ramos et al 2015 while an increase in water deficits in this period favours an increase in anthocyanins ramos and martínez de toda 2020 these effects depending on how the water deficits can vary could potentially balance the decreases on grape quality parameters that are induced by anticipated higher temperatures consequently the effects of flowering veraison water deficits on grapevine quality parameters will be dependent on the locations ramos and martínez de toda 2020 and the varieties 3 4 3 variations of potential ylr advanced phenophase seems to result in widespread reductions alleviations in potential ylr throughout all studied wine regions fig 6 reductions of statistical significance are simulated for 15 and 25 shifted phenophase hence this indicates positive effects on water limited potential yield see section 2 4 4 for i p s countries especially for the drought prone regions the median reductions on ylr are generally moderate 15 i e moderate increase of water limited potential yields fig 6 it is also accompanied by considerable inter annual variability where the 90 uncertainty range is between 20 and 40 fig s13 for f g l countries significant median reductions of ylr mainly correspond to 5 20 under 15 and 25 shifted phenophase fig 6 c f the respective upper 95th percentile indicates ylr can be potentially reduced by up to 80 e g in germany fig s13 lastly a linear negative relationship is found between cwsi and water limited potential yield both without and with shifted phenophase fig s14 clearly this relationship depends on the year and annual climate conditions fig s14 yet it is consistently found shifted phenophase can lead to increased yield sensitivities to drought stress which is evidenced by increased slope values of linear regressions without and with 25 shifted phenophase the estimated potential cluster weight yield reductions as per 0 1 increase in cwsi are 29 49 g and 33 59 g 90 uncertainty range over 1986 2015 respectively fig s14 these results suggest advanced phenology tends to have positive effects for water limited potential yield for most wine regions which are more effective with 25 shifted phenophase the flowering verasion phase represents a crucial period for yield responses to water stress which has been observed in the fields chacón vozmediano et al 2020 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 and successfully reflected in our simulations fig s14 gaudin et al 2014 explicitly report the negative linear relationship between flowering veraison water stress and berry weight for i p s countries especially for drought prone regions the overall moderate increase of water limited potential yield can be associated with the shifted phenophase towards a wetter and cooler period leading to small but significantly reduced cwsi fig 5 e f these beneficial effects can outweigh the negative impacts on potential yield associated with reduced growth season length i e early ripening and maturity with advanced phenophase however for f g l countries increases of water limited potential yield can be mainly owing to the shifted growing phase not only flowering veraison period towards a cooler climate with reduced evaporative demand along the season this can partly offset the adverse effects on yield due to reduced growing length and flowering veraison precipitation fig s8 it is also because water stress is overall less pronounced in these wine regions fig 4 thus reduced precipitation with advanced phenology has less influence in addition for these regions such as bordeaux moselle rheinhessen advanced phenophase can help avoid crop exposure to possible heatwave peaks during the ripening period fraga et al 2020 despite generally potential yield gains with shifted phenophase drought sensitivities are increased this is possibly attributed to a shorter growing season with less time for photosynthesis and biomass accumulation where plant growth and yield formation becomes more sensitive and vulnerable to water stress van ittersum et al 2013 on the other hand the linear relationship between cwsi and water limited potential yield is shown to vary with annual climate conditions it can also depend on genotypic characteristics gaudin et al 2014 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2014 which should be further distinguished in subsequent studies 4 conclusion the present study essentially is a retrospective analysis for important wine regions in six different european countries over 1986 2015 the analysis focuses on estimating the mean crop water stress indicator cwsi during a drought sensitive flowering veraison period cwsi for brevity and potential yield loss rate ylr yield refers to cluster weight resulting from cumulative seasonal water stress our findings suggest wine regions prone to a high drought risk cwsi 0 75 are identified as those in iberian peninsula except north western portugal southern italy apulia sardinia sicily and southern france languedoc provence rhone the corresponding ylr can range from 30 to 60 in general wine regions with stronger cwsi during flowering veraison phase tend to have higher ylr however contrasting patterns are found between wine regions in france germany luxembourg and italy portugal spain which highlights the spatial complexity and contextual dependent nature for viticulture in the former case the test of advanced flowering veraison phase suggests advanced phenology could have benefited from cooler temperatures and a higher fraction of spring precipitation resulting in alleviated cwsi with moderate reductions of ylr conversely this may result in decreased flowering veraison precipitation with more uncertain effects on cwsi in those of france germany luxembourg however since water stress in these regions is generally less severe than those in southern mediterranean europe the shifted phenology towards a cooler season might also lead to increased potential yields i e reduced ylr in extreme years nevertheless effects of shifted phenophase are subject to uncertainties across all wine regions which might be associated with the strong inter annual variability of local precipitation overall we demonstrate the flowering verasion water availability can be critical to potential vineyard productivity which is dependent on local soil and climate conditions and genoptyic characteristics with global warming such phenophase is expected to be advanced the obtained positive effects on water stress reductions and potential yields under past conditions depending on the magnitude of warming can be reversed for local vineyards such a trade off due to interactions between shifting a drought sensitive phase into a relatively cooler and wetter growing season and changes in local temperature and precipitation patterns should be explicitly considered in climate impact assessment studies on the other hand the underlying implications on grapevine quality parameters are more complex and should be further examined such a retrospective analysis might provide new insights towards better management of seasonal water deficit for conventionally vulnerable mediterranean wine regions but also for relatively cooler and wetter central european regions where water stress is becoming increasingly important

9753,soil water and fertilizer are two main factors affecting tomato yield and quality and their optimization management is crucial for sustainable production there are many studies about the response of tomato growth and fruit yield formation to irrigation level and potassium k fertilizer but few studies have been conducted on the responses of irrigation level and controlled release potassium chloride crk not to mention the different irrigation levels and crk to kcl blending ratios in this study two consecutive growing seasons 2020 2021 tomato pot experiments were presented with three irrigation levels w100 w80 and w60 and three blending ratios of crk to kcl 100 80 20 60 40 under the condition that the amount of potassium fertilizer was reduced by 40 compared with conventional application rate the results revealed that under w80 water conditions 80 crk mixed with 20 kcl application led to a significant increase in tomato yield by 4 1 11 9 and 4 6 18 9 k use efficiency by 11 5 34 2 and 6 1 32 3 fruit vitamin c content by 9 3 25 3 and 5 6 28 3 fruit soluble sugar content by 10 2 20 0 and 10 2 24 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively compared with the other k fertilization treatments meanwhile the water use efficiency and fruit soluble solid content of w80k80 treatment were also maintained at a high level molecular analysis shows that the w80k80 treatment had a higher photosynthetic rate rubisco content cytokinin content and osmotic regulation substances content and lower abscisic acid aba malondialdehyde mda and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 contents our results indicated that 80 irrigation level and 80 crk 20 kcl blending ratio were the optimal water and k supply mode for tomato production in this study the result provided useful information regarding greenhouse tomato production that would allow the achievement of higher fruit yield quality and resource use efficiencies and provided theoretical and technical support for greenhouse tomato irrigation and k fertilizer application technologies keywords irrigation level controlled release potassium chloride crk to kcl blending ratio endogenous hormones osmotic regulation substances 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is one of the most popular vegetables cultivated worldwide which has rich in lycopene vitamins amino acid organic acids antioxidants and minerals savić et al 2008 erba et al 2013 world demand for tomatoes increases annually creating considerable space for tomato cultivation lahoz et al 2016 the yellow river basin is the largest greenhouse tomato planting area in china which plays an essential role in the supply of fresh tomatoes bao and li 2010 however with the widespread planting of greenhouse tomatoes a variety of adverse effects followed the economic benefits of greenhouse tomato cultivation drive farmers to use irrigation water and fertilizers in large quantities to achieve higher yields which results in a series of problems such as wasting agricultural water and fertilizer resources undermining tomato yield and causing economic and environmental problems li et al 2017a 2017b meanwhile with global challenges imposed by the increasing population and the negative impacts of climate change agricultural water shortages are becoming more frequent ye et al 2015 therefore a reasonable irrigation and fertilization strategy that reduces water and fertilizer resources waste improves water and fertilizer production and maintains yield is needed drip irrigation is one of the most popular water saving irrigation techniques in the world which provides the required quantity of water directly to the root zone of plants mattar et al 2020 drip irrigation is superior to traditional furrow irrigation in improving water use efficiency wue and saving agricultural water resources with ideal effects on large area planting choudhary et al 2010 however as the most common irrigation method in greenhouse vegetable planting in china furrow irrigation is widely used especially in economically backward areas mohammadi et al 2019 the small area family planting model makes the high investment of drip irrigation technology unable to be accepted by farmers therefore there is an urgent need for economic and simple irrigation technology to meet the requirement of farmers for water saving irrigation in the last few decades deficit irrigation has been proposed with the consideration of water shortage in the yellow river basin which is the important water saving irrigation strategy in semi arid areas yuan et al 2019 li et al 2010 deficit irrigation is a suitable method with less investment and simple operation which has the characteristics of saving agricultural water and improve wue zou et al 2020 ma et al 2019 it s a practice that makes plants tolerate or resist drought stress by reducing irrigation during the entire crop cycle or by withdrawing irrigation at certain stages sun et al 2014 deficit irrigation has been proved to increase tomato fruit quality and wue cantore et al 2016 wang et al 2015 a previous study on tomatoes demonstrated that when the irrigation amount was reduced by 50 at the ripening stage the irrigation amount could be saved by 30 4 however yield penalty due to drought stress under deficit irrigation has frequently been noticed in different crop species including tomatoes agbna et al 2017 lu et al 2019 analyzed 25 research articles with 561 experimental groups found that deficit irrigation decreased tomato yield with a mean difference of 18 6 t ha 1 meanwhile compared with conventional irrigation deficit irrigation significantly reduced tomato leaves stoma conductance and photosynthetic rate akhtar et al 2014 reducing irrigation amount while maintaining a high tomato yield is required for the sustainable development of agriculture cui et al 2020 previous studies have shown that water and nutrient may interact with each other to produce a coupling effect pan et al 2017 therefore formulating an appropriate fertilization strategy to offset the negative impact of deficit irrigation on tomato growth and yield is a necessary condition to improve its applicability and sustainability potassium k is the most essential and abundant inorganic cation in the plant which can make up 10 of plant dry weight it is a primary cellular osmotic regulation substance and plays an imperative role in plant water relations and is involved in numerous physiological processes related to plant tolerance drought stress including stomatal movement turgor pressure maintenance cytosolic ph homeostasis and etc tavakol et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zahoor et al 2017 previous studies show that k fertilizer application enhanced photosynthetic rate plant growth and drought resistance under water stress egilla et al 2001 meanwhile the role of k in osmotic regulation promotes the accumulation of more k ions in plant tissues and enhances the water acquisition by plants under drought stress zhang et al 2019 in recent years the importance of k in crop yield has been and reported pervez et al 2004 zain and ismail 2016 reported that the application of potassium alleviated the negative effect of drought on crops and improved crop yield and drought resistance this knowledge has stimulated substantial k fertilizer application in tomatoes cultivation resulting in leading to reducing kue unbalancing nutrient supply increasing environmental pollution risk and decreasing tomato fruit quality by enhancing the incidence of blossom end rot ju et al 2007 chen et al 2017 liu et al 2011 based on the large scale of vegetable production and the excessive application rate of potassium fertilizer in china 20 9 million ha and 5 6 million t in 2019 china statistical yearbook 2019 appropriate k fertilizer management is urgently needed to ensure optimum crop yields and the conservation k fertilizer resources the controlled release potassium chloride crk as a novel environmentally friendly k fertilizer was coated with a polymer a biobased polyurethane polymer it can reduce the fertilizer particle contact with soil and water and has advantages of high kue low labor input and time saving yang et al 2017 when crk usually was applied once previous studies showed that polymer coated potassium chloride application promoted tomato plant growth and increased tomato yield quality water use efficiency wue and kue compared with potassium chloride kcl application qu et al 2020 although crk has many advantages it still has some problems such as the slow release of potassium at the early stage of application which cannot meet the k demand of crop seedlings furthermore the high manufacturing cost of crk makes it difficult to be widely used to make up for the shortcomings of the crk application the problem of slow initial release and high price can be solved by mixing crk with kcl in a particular proportion yang et al 2017 reported that the release rate of crk and kcl compound had the characteristics of synchronization with cotton plants nutrient uptake in the whole growth period and increased cotton yield and quality compared to crk meanwhile fertilizer prices and labor costs have fallen sharply therefore crk and kcl compound has great potential for decreasing input and increasing crop yield quality net come and kue both water and fertilizer are considered to be the most important and manageable environmental factors affecting crop growth effective water and k fertilizer management strategy are essential to guarantee the wue and kue as well as maintain yield hence for the sake of improving irrigation efficiency and reducing the yield and environmental damage caused by excessive k fertilizer application in the process of tomato planting two years of pot experiments were conducted in this study to learn the best combination of different irrigation levels and the proportion of crk mixed with kcl to maximize the synergy under the 40 k application rate reduction conditions the purposes of this experiment are1 to explore the tomato plant growth and fruit yield response to different irrigation levels and crk to kcl

endogenous hormones on tomato roots and leaves phytohormones respond to drought as signal molecules that regulate plant water relations among them aba and ctk are two hormones that feature prominently in current drought stress research we analyzed the contents of aba and ctk in tomato roots and leaves the results indicated that the w100 and w60 treatments increased the roots and leaves aba content p 0 05 while it reduced ctk content p 0 05 compared with w80 treatments fig 7 the k80 treatments decreased the aba content p 0 05 and increased ctk content p 0 05 compared with k100 and k60 treatments

roots and leaves respectively 3 7 lipid peroxidation on tomato roots and leaves drought stress triggered excessive accumulation of h2o2 which causes damage to a wide range of cellular components and membrane lipids mda is one of the membrane lipids peroxides in plant cells and its content can reflect the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation at the fruit enlargement and ripening stages h2o2 and mda contents in tomato leaves and roots decreased first and increased with the decrease of irrigation level fig 8 under the w80 water conditions the h2o2 and mda contents were 0 582 μmol g 1 85 3 nmol g 1 in leaves and 0 596 μmol g 1 86 2 nmol g 1 in roots in the fruit enlargement stage and 0 672 μmol g 1 89 8 nmol g 1 in leaves and 0 649 μmol g 1 92 7 nmol g 1 in roots in the fruit ripening stage respectively the h2o2 and mda contents in tomato leaves and roots decreased first and increased with the decrease of crk blending ratio under the 80 crk mixed with 20 kcl conditions the h2o2 and mda contents in leaves and roots were the lowest which were 0 592 μmol g 1 86 3 nmol g 1 in leaves and 0 615 μmol g 1 87 5 nmol g 1 in roots in the fruit enlargement stage and 0 722 μmol g 1 90 5 nmol g 1

enlargement and ripening stages compared with the other k fertilization treatments the w80k80 treatment decreased roots h2o2 and mda contents by 4 0 20 6 and 6 9 22 1 at the fruit enlargement stage 4 0 32 1 and 4 5 20 9 at the fruit ripening stage while it decreased leaves h2o2 and mda contents by 9 8 28 0 and 1 2 13 3 at the fruit enlargement stage 2 0 22 3 and 4 7 20 6 at the fruit ripening stage respectively 3 8 osmotic regulation substances on tomato leaves osmotic regulation is an important way for plants to improve the synthesis ability of osmotic regulation substances maintain cell turgor reduce osmotic potential and resist stress under drought stress proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein are important osmotic regulation substances in plants which play an important role in maintaining the normal osmotic pressure of cells maintaining the stability of the membrane system and improving the stress resistance of plants we analyzed the proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein contents in tomato leaves our data indicate that decreased drought significantly increased the osmotic regulation substances content and its content gradually increased with the increase of drought degree fig 9 the w60 treatments exhibited the highest proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein contents which were 1178 3 ng g 1 2523 2 ug g 1 2486 9 ng g 1 30 6 mg g 1in the fruit enlargement stage and 1055 6 ng g 1 2561 7 ug g 1 3106 4 ng g 1 33 0 mg g 1 in the fruit ripening stage respectively the crk application significantly increased the osmotic regulation substances content in leaves which firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of crk blending ratio the k80 treatments exhibited the highest proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein contents which were 1065 0 ng g 1 2431 7 ug g 1 2463 2 ng g 1 29 1 mg g 1 in the fruit enlargement stage and 991 6 ng g 1 2539 9 ug g 1 2902 1 ng g 1 31 5 mg g 1 in the fruit ripening stage respectively the w60k80 treatment exhibited the highest osmotic regulation substances contents in leaves at the two growth stages compared with the other k fertilization treatments the w60k80 treatment increased leaves proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein contents by 6 7 44 9 6 9 36 5 4 8 23 9 and 1 8 31 7 at the fruit enlargement stage and 10 6 37 7 5 3 21 0 2 3 28 6 and 11 4 41 7 at the fruit ripening stage respectively 4 discussion tomato is an important vegetable that demands a lot of water li et al 2021 as the only source of soil water for greenhouse tomatoes irrigation has a great impact on tomato yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency chen et al 2014 the result of the present study showed that tomato yield and kue increased significantly with the increase of irrigation amount maximum yield and kue 2777 1 g pot 1 and 57 8 in 2020 and 2992 9 g pot 1 and 62 0 in 2021 respectively occurred in 87 l pot 1 and 90 6 l pot 1 irrigation amounts table 1 however a further increase in the irrigation level from w80 to w100 caused a decrease in tomato yield and kue the result is illustrated by the findings of bhattacharyya et al 2018 and li et al 2017b who reported that crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency first increased and then decreased with an increase in irrigation amounts cammarano et al 2020 study in field tomato found that the decrease in rainfall caused an overall 15 reduction in tomato yield to offset the negative impact of rainfall decreases additional irrigation water from 85 to 110 mm and nitrogen rate from 20 to 30 kg n ha 1 is needed however the large increase in irrigation water does not translate in significant yield increase and caused an increase in water and nitrogen use efficiency of less than 10 this was likely due to deficit irrigation leading to root to shoot hormonal signals mainly xylem sap aba concentration was accumulated in the drying roots and transported to the leaf resulting in stomatal closure lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate brunetti et al 2019 meanwhile the h2o2 and mda concentration increased in leaf and roots fig 8 the leaf plasma membrane damaged the cell osmotic disordered the photosynthetic rate decreased and ultimately decreased tomato yield and kue similar observations were made by liu et al 2019 excessive irrigation led to rapid k release from the crk or crk and kcl mixtures which reduced k absorption by roots in the peak of tomato k demand period and decreased ctk syntheses increased aba syntheses and ultimately inhibited tomato plant growth and fruit development zahoor et al 2017 found the similar result in cotton however appropriate water deficit can keep the water within a small volume of soil in the root zone to improve the soil aeration conditions and promote more nutrient supply from soil or more oxygen supply to the root system produce and supply more assimilates to reproductive organs sun et al 2012 and thereby increase fruit yield and kue table 1 meanwhile appropriate water deficit can also promote roots water absorption and improved wue a previous study by zamora re et al 2020 reported deficit irrigation or excessive irrigation reduced wue and slight drought stress could facilitate wue the same rule was also found in tomato fruit quality indicators table 2 the positive impact of appropriate irrigation amounts and the negative impact of high irrigation amounts on fruit quality were reported by li et al 2021 this was mainly attributed to the adequate water deficit conditions increased tomato leaves proline betaine soluble sugar soluble protein and rubisco contents figs 5 and 9 which improved photosynthetic rate promoted more transfer of photosynthetic products directed into the fruits enhancing the vc soluble sugar and soluble solid contents in fruit agbna et al 2017 potassium contributes to plant resistance to drought stresses by improving osmotic adjustment controlling stomatal pore size activating photosynthesis detoxicating reactive oxygen species ros and loading phloem photosynthates wang et al 2014 our previous study has shown that the application of polymer coated potassium chloride significantly increased soil available k content improved tomato plants growth fruit yield and wue under drought conditions qu et al 2020 in our present experiments we found that 80 crk 20 kcl mixtures have a better yield increasing effect than 100 crk and 60 crk 40 kcl mixtures compared with 100 crk and 60 crk 40 kcl mixtures application 80 crk 20 kcl mixtures application increased tomato yield kue and wue by 2 5 5 4 10 0 13 6 and 2 8 5 4 in 2020 and 3 2 7 4 3 7 9 8 and 3 7 8 4 in 2021 respectively table 1 yang et al 2017 found similar results in cotton cultivation this is mainly determined by the release characteristics of crk the nutrient release rate of controlled release fertilizers is significantly affected by soil moisture lamont et al 1987 in w100 water conditions the higher soil moisture resulted in the rapid release of k in crk and two crk to kcl mixtures leading to the rapid increase of soil available k content fig 3 the rapid release of k in fertilizer significantly reduced the soil available k content in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages inhibited roots k absorption caused k deficiency and premature senility at the late fruit ripening stage the w60 water conditions were in a water shortage state for a long time and the k release rate of 100 crk was slower than that of w100 and w80 water conditions which resulted in a long term deficiency of soil available k and inhibited plant growth although 80 crk 20 kcl mixtures and 60 crk 40 kcl mixtures were released faster in the tomato seedling stage the k release rate decreased rapidly after the flowering stage which leads to a lower soil available k content in the peak of tomato k demand period resulting in a decline in fruit yield and quality the same results were documented in previous studies which compared with normal k application treatment k deficiency treatment severely decreased tomato plant biomass and fruit yield kanai et al 2007 in w80 water conditions k100 treatments released less k in the seeding stage which could not meet the k requirement of tomato seedling growth k60 treatments had less k supply after the flowering stage which could not meet the k demand of tomato fruit expansion however k80 treatments were partially released k in the tomato seedling stage and accelerated during the peak of tomato k demand period well matching the k absorption need of tomato fig 3 appropriate soil available k supply promoted roots k absorption increased rubisco and osmotic regulation substances contents in leaves decreased h2o2 contents and lipid peroxidation and resulted in a photosynthetic rate increase figs 5 and 8 table 3 wang et al 2014 also found similar results that appropriate k content in soil increased rubisco content in soybean leaves and resulted in photosynthesis increase strong tomato leaves photosynthesis promoted photosynthetic products transfer to fruit to ensure fruit growth and then increased fruit yield and quality water use efficiency is positively correlated with irrigation level and tomato yield under the same irrigation level the increase in tomato yield increased the wue wang et al 2015 compared with the single effect of irrigation level or crk to kcl blending ratio their interaction had a more significant impact on tomato growth high fruit yield better quality in tomato production should be attributed to the maximum comprehensive benefit of kue wue and physiological indexes this study showed that the w80k80 treatment had the optimal comprehensive benefit which had higher tomato yield kue wue quality and physiological indexes the w80k80 treatment achieved the highest yield in both years the vc soluble sugar and soluble solids in w80k80 treatment were 9 3 25 3 10 2 20 0 and 3 3 13 9 higher in 2020 and 5 6 28 3 10 2 24 1 and 0 1 10 0 higher in 2021 than those in the others k fertilization treatments respectively meanwhile the kue and wue were higher in the w80k80 treatment this was because that the suitable soil water conditions combined with 80 crk 20 kcl improved ctk contents in tomato roots and leaves and promoted the growth of tomato plants and the development of fruits at the same time favorable growth conditions promoted the increase of leaf rubisco content inhibited the increase of h2o2 and mda contents improved the net photosynthetic rate and increased nutrient accumulation similar observations were made by wang et al 2015 5 conclusions this study showed that irrigation level and crk to kcl blending ratio strategies had an obvious interaction on tomato yield quality and water k use efficiency under the interactive effect of 80 irrigation level 80 crk and 20 kcl mixtures combination the soil available k supply was consistent with the demand of tomato in the process of greenhouse tomato furthermore the aba and ctk contents h2o2 and mda contents in leaves and roots and the rubisco and osmotic regulation substances content in leaves reached the proper level which significantly improved leaves photosynthetic rate and increased the fruit yield and quality meanwhile the w80k80 treatment saved irrigation water by 20 and enhanced kue wue by 11 5 7 9 in 2020 and 9 3 8 6 in 2021 respectively compared with w100k80 treatment considering the tradeoff between yields quality kue and wue the w80k80 treatment was the best water and k management strategy for greenhouse tomato cultivation in the yellow river basin of china in the future greenhouse tomato cultivation farmers can apply controlled release mixed potassium fertilizer 80 crk and 20 kcl while

9753,soil water and fertilizer are two main factors affecting tomato yield and quality and their optimization management is crucial for sustainable production there are many studies about the response of tomato growth and fruit yield formation to irrigation level and potassium k fertilizer but few studies have been conducted on the responses of irrigation level and controlled release potassium chloride crk not to mention the different irrigation levels and crk to kcl blending ratios in this study two consecutive growing seasons 2020 2021 tomato pot experiments were presented with three irrigation levels w100 w80 and w60 and three blending ratios of crk to kcl 100 80 20 60 40 under the condition that the amount of potassium fertilizer was reduced by 40 compared with conventional application rate the results revealed that under w80 water conditions 80 crk mixed with 20 kcl application led to a significant increase in tomato yield by 4 1 11 9 and 4 6 18 9 k use efficiency by 11 5 34 2 and 6 1 32 3 fruit vitamin c content by 9 3 25 3 and 5 6 28 3 fruit soluble sugar content by 10 2 20 0 and 10 2 24 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively compared with the other k fertilization treatments meanwhile the water use efficiency and fruit soluble solid content of w80k80 treatment were also maintained at a high level molecular analysis shows that the w80k80 treatment had a higher photosynthetic rate rubisco content cytokinin content and osmotic regulation substances content and lower abscisic acid aba malondialdehyde mda and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 contents our results indicated that 80 irrigation level and 80 crk 20 kcl blending ratio were the optimal water and k supply mode for tomato production in this study the result provided useful information regarding greenhouse tomato production that would allow the achievement of higher fruit yield quality and resource use efficiencies and provided theoretical and technical support for greenhouse tomato irrigation and k fertilizer application technologies keywords irrigation level controlled release potassium chloride crk to kcl blending ratio endogenous hormones osmotic regulation substances 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is one of the most popular vegetables cultivated worldwide which has rich in lycopene vitamins amino acid organic acids antioxidants and minerals savić et al 2008 erba et al 2013 world demand for tomatoes increases annually creating considerable space for tomato cultivation lahoz et al 2016 the yellow river basin is the largest greenhouse tomato planting area in china which plays an essential role in the supply of fresh tomatoes bao and li 2010 however with the widespread planting of greenhouse tomatoes a variety of adverse effects followed the economic benefits of greenhouse tomato cultivation drive farmers to use irrigation water and fertilizers in large quantities to achieve higher yields which results in a series of problems such as wasting agricultural water and fertilizer resources undermining tomato yield and causing economic and environmental problems li et al 2017a 2017b meanwhile with global challenges imposed by the increasing population and the negative impacts of climate change agricultural water shortages are becoming more frequent ye et al 2015 therefore a reasonable irrigation and fertilization strategy that reduces water and fertilizer resources waste improves water and fertilizer production and maintains yield is needed drip irrigation is one of the most popular water saving irrigation techniques in the world which provides the required quantity of water directly to the root zone of plants mattar et al 2020 drip irrigation is superior to traditional furrow irrigation in improving water use efficiency wue and saving agricultural water resources with ideal effects on large area planting choudhary et al 2010 however as the most common irrigation method in greenhouse vegetable planting in china furrow irrigation is widely used especially in economically backward areas mohammadi et al 2019 the small area family planting model makes the high investment of drip irrigation technology unable to be accepted by farmers therefore there is an urgent need for economic and simple irrigation technology to meet the requirement of farmers for water saving irrigation in the last few decades deficit irrigation has been proposed with the consideration of water shortage in the yellow river basin which is the important water saving irrigation strategy in semi arid areas yuan et al 2019 li et al 2010 deficit irrigation is a suitable method with less investment and simple operation which has the characteristics of saving agricultural water and improve wue zou et al 2020 ma et al 2019 it s a practice that makes plants tolerate or resist drought stress by reducing irrigation during the entire crop cycle or by withdrawing irrigation at certain stages sun et al 2014 deficit irrigation has been proved to increase tomato fruit quality and wue cantore et al 2016 wang et al 2015 a previous study on tomatoes demonstrated that when the irrigation amount was reduced by 50 at the ripening stage the irrigation amount could be saved by 30 4 however yield penalty due to drought stress under deficit irrigation has frequently been noticed in different crop species including tomatoes agbna et al 2017 lu et al 2019 analyzed 25 research articles with 561 experimental groups found that deficit irrigation decreased tomato yield with a mean difference of 18 6 t ha 1 meanwhile compared with conventional irrigation deficit irrigation significantly reduced tomato leaves stoma conductance and photosynthetic rate akhtar et al 2014 reducing irrigation amount while maintaining a high tomato yield is required for the sustainable development of agriculture cui et al 2020 previous studies have shown that water and nutrient may interact with each other to produce a coupling effect pan et al 2017 therefore formulating an appropriate fertilization strategy to offset the negative impact of deficit irrigation on tomato growth and yield is a necessary condition to improve its applicability and sustainability potassium k is the most essential and abundant inorganic cation in the plant which can make up 10 of plant dry weight it is a primary cellular osmotic regulation substance and plays an imperative role in plant water relations and is involved in numerous physiological processes related to plant tolerance drought stress including stomatal movement turgor pressure maintenance cytosolic ph homeostasis and etc tavakol et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zahoor et al 2017 previous studies show that k fertilizer application enhanced photosynthetic rate plant growth and drought resistance under water stress egilla et al 2001 meanwhile the role of k in osmotic regulation promotes the accumulation of more k ions in plant tissues and enhances the water acquisition by plants under drought stress zhang et al 2019 in recent years the importance of k in crop yield has been and reported pervez et al 2004 zain and ismail 2016 reported that the application of potassium alleviated the negative effect of drought on crops and improved crop yield and drought resistance this knowledge has stimulated substantial k fertilizer application in tomatoes cultivation resulting in leading to reducing kue unbalancing nutrient supply increasing environmental pollution risk and decreasing tomato fruit quality by enhancing the incidence of blossom end rot ju et al 2007 chen et al 2017 liu et al 2011 based on the large scale of vegetable production and the excessive application rate of potassium fertilizer in china 20 9 million ha and 5 6 million t in 2019 china statistical yearbook 2019 appropriate k fertilizer management is urgently needed to ensure optimum crop yields and the conservation k fertilizer resources the controlled release potassium chloride crk as a novel environmentally friendly k fertilizer was coated with a polymer a biobased polyurethane polymer it can reduce the fertilizer particle contact with soil and water and has advantages of high kue low labor input and time saving yang et al 2017 when crk usually was applied once previous studies showed that polymer coated potassium chloride application promoted tomato plant growth and increased tomato yield quality water use efficiency wue and kue compared with potassium chloride kcl application qu et al 2020 although crk has many advantages it still has some problems such as the slow release of potassium at the early stage of application which cannot meet the k demand of crop seedlings furthermore the high manufacturing cost of crk makes it difficult to be widely used to make up for the shortcomings of the crk application the problem of slow initial release and high price can be solved by mixing crk with kcl in a particular proportion yang et al 2017 reported that the release rate of crk and kcl compound had the characteristics of synchronization with cotton plants nutrient uptake in the whole growth period and increased cotton yield and quality compared to crk meanwhile fertilizer prices and labor costs have fallen sharply therefore crk and kcl compound has great potential for decreasing input and increasing crop yield quality net come and kue both water and fertilizer are considered to be the most important and manageable environmental factors affecting crop growth effective water and k fertilizer management strategy are essential to guarantee the wue and kue as well as maintain yield hence for the sake of improving irrigation efficiency and reducing the yield and environmental damage caused by excessive k fertilizer application in the process of tomato planting two years of pot experiments were conducted in this study to learn the best combination of different irrigation levels and the proportion of crk mixed with kcl to maximize the synergy under the 40 k application rate reduction conditions the purposes of this experiment are1 to explore the tomato plant growth and fruit yield response to different irrigation levels and crk to kcl blending ratio 2 to find an optimum assembly of water and k fertilizer to maximize tomato fruit yield and quality 3 to establish reasonable water and potassium management strategy for the greenhouse tomato cultivation in the yellow river basin of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site experiments and cropping details a tomato pot experiment was conducted during two consecutive growing seasons apr

p 0 05 while it reduced ctk content p 0 05 compared with w80 treatments fig 7 the k80 treatments decreased the aba content p 0 05 and increased ctk content p 0 05 compared with k100 and k60 treatments there was a significant irrigation level crk to kcl blending ratio interaction in the response of aba p 0 05 and ctk contents p 0 05 on roots and leaves the w80k80 treatment exhibited the lowest aba content and highest ctk content in the roots and leaves compared with the other k fertilization treatments the w80k80 treatment decreased aba content by 8 1 35 1 and 3 5 31 4 at the fruit enlargement stage 3 3 28 3 and 7 6 26 9 at the fruit ripening stage while it increased ctk content by 1 8 25 5 and 3 0 17 5 at the fruit enlargement stage 1 1 14 2 and 2 8 16 2 at the fruit ripening stage in roots and leaves respectively 3 7 lipid peroxidation on tomato roots and leaves drought stress triggered excessive accumulation of h2o2 which causes damage to a wide range of cellular components and membrane lipids mda is one of the membrane lipids peroxides in plant cells and its content can reflect the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation at the fruit enlargement and ripening stages h2o2 and mda contents in tomato leaves and roots decreased first and increased with the decrease of irrigation level fig 8 under the w80 water conditions the h2o2 and mda contents were 0 582 μmol g 1 85 3 nmol g 1 in leaves and 0 596 μmol g 1 86 2 nmol g 1 in roots in the fruit enlargement stage and 0 672 μmol g 1 89 8 nmol g 1 in leaves and 0 649 μmol g 1 92 7 nmol g 1 in roots in the fruit ripening stage respectively the h2o2 and mda contents in tomato leaves and roots decreased first and increased with the decrease of crk blending ratio under the 80 crk mixed with 20 kcl conditions the h2o2 and mda contents in leaves and roots were the lowest which were 0 592 μmol g 1 86 3 nmol g 1 in leaves and 0 615 μmol g 1 87 5 nmol g 1 in roots in the fruit enlargement stage and 0 722 μmol g 1 90 5 nmol g 1 in leaves and 0 689 μmol g 1 92 9 nmol g 1 in roots in the fruit ripening stage respectively the w80k80 treatment exhibited the lowest h2o2 and mda contents in the roots and leaves at the fruit enlargement and ripening stages compared with the other k fertilization treatments the w80k80 treatment decreased roots h2o2 and mda contents by 4 0 20 6 and 6 9 22 1 at the fruit enlargement stage 4 0 32 1 and 4 5 20 9 at the fruit ripening stage while it decreased leaves h2o2 and mda contents by 9 8 28 0 and 1 2 13 3 at the fruit enlargement stage 2 0 22 3 and 4 7 20 6 at the fruit ripening stage respectively 3 8 osmotic regulation substances on tomato leaves osmotic regulation is an important way for plants to improve the synthesis ability of osmotic regulation substances maintain cell turgor reduce osmotic potential and resist stress under drought stress proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein are important osmotic regulation substances in plants which play an important role in maintaining the normal osmotic pressure of cells maintaining the stability of the membrane system and improving the stress resistance of plants we analyzed the proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein contents in tomato leaves our data indicate that decreased drought significantly increased the osmotic regulation substances content and its content gradually increased with the increase of drought degree fig 9 the w60 treatments exhibited the highest proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein contents which were 1178 3 ng g 1 2523 2 ug g 1 2486 9 ng g 1 30 6 mg g 1in the fruit enlargement stage and 1055 6 ng g 1 2561 7 ug g 1 3106 4 ng g 1 33 0 mg g 1 in the fruit ripening stage respectively the crk application significantly increased the osmotic regulation substances content in leaves which firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of crk blending ratio the k80 treatments exhibited the highest proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein contents which were 1065 0 ng g 1 2431 7 ug g 1 2463 2 ng g 1 29 1 mg g 1 in the fruit enlargement stage and 991 6 ng g 1 2539 9 ug g 1 2902 1 ng g 1 31 5 mg g 1 in the fruit ripening stage respectively the w60k80 treatment exhibited the highest osmotic regulation substances contents in leaves at the two growth stages compared with the other k fertilization treatments the w60k80 treatment increased leaves proline soluble sugar betaine and soluble protein contents by 6 7 44 9 6 9 36 5 4 8 23 9 and 1 8 31 7 at the fruit enlargement stage and 10 6 37 7 5 3 21 0 2 3 28 6 and 11 4 41 7 at the fruit ripening stage respectively 4 discussion tomato is an important vegetable that demands a lot of water li et al 2021 as the only source of soil water for greenhouse tomatoes irrigation has a great impact on tomato yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency chen et al 2014 the result of the present study showed that tomato yield and kue increased significantly with the increase of irrigation amount maximum yield and kue 2777 1 g pot 1 and 57 8 in 2020 and 2992 9 g pot 1 and 62 0 in 2021 respectively occurred in 87 l pot 1 and 90 6 l pot 1 irrigation amounts table 1 however a further increase in the irrigation level from w80 to w100 caused a decrease in tomato yield and kue the result is illustrated by the findings of bhattacharyya et al 2018 and li et al 2017b who reported that crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency first increased and then decreased with an increase in irrigation amounts cammarano et al 2020 study in field tomato found that the decrease in rainfall caused an overall 15 reduction in tomato yield to offset the negative impact of rainfall decreases additional irrigation water from 85 to 110 mm and nitrogen rate from 20 to 30 kg n ha 1 is needed however the large increase in irrigation water does not translate in significant yield increase and caused an increase in water and nitrogen use efficiency of less than 10 this was likely due to deficit irrigation leading to root to shoot hormonal signals mainly xylem sap aba concentration was accumulated in the drying roots and transported to the leaf resulting in stomatal closure lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate brunetti et al 2019 meanwhile the h2o2 and mda concentration increased in leaf and roots fig 8 the leaf plasma membrane damaged the cell osmotic disordered the photosynthetic rate decreased and ultimately decreased tomato yield and kue similar observations were made by liu et al 2019 excessive irrigation led to rapid k release from the crk or crk and kcl mixtures which reduced k absorption by roots in the peak of tomato k demand period and decreased ctk syntheses increased aba syntheses and ultimately inhibited tomato plant growth and fruit development zahoor et al 2017 found the similar result in cotton however appropriate water deficit can keep the water within a small volume of soil in the root zone to improve the soil aeration conditions and promote more nutrient supply from soil or more oxygen supply to the root system produce and supply more assimilates to reproductive organs sun et al 2012 and thereby increase fruit yield and kue table 1 meanwhile appropriate water deficit can also promote roots water absorption and improved wue a previous study by zamora re et al 2020 reported deficit irrigation or excessive irrigation reduced wue and slight drought stress could facilitate wue the same rule was also found in tomato fruit quality indicators table 2 the positive impact of appropriate irrigation amounts and the negative impact of high irrigation amounts on fruit quality were reported by li et al 2021 this was mainly attributed to the adequate water deficit conditions increased tomato leaves proline betaine soluble sugar soluble protein and rubisco contents figs 5 and 9 which improved photosynthetic rate promoted more transfer of photosynthetic products directed into the fruits enhancing the vc soluble sugar and soluble solid contents in fruit agbna et al 2017 potassium contributes to plant resistance to drought stresses by improving osmotic adjustment controlling stomatal pore size activating photosynthesis detoxicating reactive oxygen species ros and loading phloem photosynthates wang et al 2014 our previous study has shown that the application of polymer coated potassium chloride significantly increased soil available k content improved tomato plants growth fruit yield and wue under drought conditions qu et al 2020 in our present experiments we found that 80 crk 20 kcl mixtures have a better yield increasing effect than 100 crk and 60 crk 40 kcl mixtures compared with 100 crk and 60 crk 40 kcl mixtures application 80 crk 20 kcl mixtures application increased tomato yield kue and wue by 2 5 5 4 10 0 13 6 and 2 8 5 4 in 2020 and 3 2 7 4 3 7 9 8 and 3 7 8 4 in 2021 respectively table 1 yang et al 2017 found similar results in cotton cultivation this is mainly determined by the release characteristics of crk the nutrient release rate of controlled release fertilizers is significantly affected by soil moisture lamont et al 1987 in w100 water conditions the higher soil moisture resulted in the rapid release of k in crk and two crk to kcl mixtures leading to the rapid increase of soil available k content fig 3 the rapid release of k in fertilizer significantly reduced the soil available k content in the fruit enlargement and ripening stages inhibited roots k absorption caused k deficiency and premature senility at the late fruit ripening stage the w60 water conditions were in a water shortage state for a long time and the k release rate of 100 crk was slower than that of w100 and w80 water conditions which resulted in a long term deficiency of soil available k and inhibited plant growth although 80 crk 20 kcl mixtures and 60 crk 40 kcl mixtures were released faster in the tomato seedling stage the k release rate decreased rapidly after the flowering stage which leads to a lower soil available k content in the peak of tomato k demand period resulting in a decline in fruit yield and quality the same results were documented in previous studies which compared with normal k application treatment k deficiency treatment severely decreased tomato plant biomass and fruit yield kanai et al 2007 in w80 water conditions k100 treatments released less k in the seeding stage which could not meet the k requirement of tomato seedling growth k60 treatments had less k supply after the flowering stage which could not meet the k demand of tomato fruit expansion however k80 treatments were partially released k in the tomato seedling stage and accelerated during the peak of tomato k demand period well matching the k absorption need of tomato fig 3 appropriate soil available k supply promoted roots k absorption increased rubisco and osmotic regulation substances contents in leaves decreased h2o2 contents and lipid peroxidation and resulted in a photosynthetic rate increase figs 5 and 8 table 3 wang et al 2014 also found similar results that appropriate k content in soil increased rubisco content in soybean leaves and resulted in photosynthesis increase strong tomato leaves photosynthesis promoted photosynthetic products transfer to fruit to ensure fruit growth and then increased fruit yield and quality water use efficiency is positively correlated with irrigation level and tomato yield under the same irrigation level the increase in tomato yield increased the wue wang et al 2015 compared with the single effect of irrigation level or crk to kcl blending ratio their interaction had a more significant impact on tomato growth high fruit yield better quality in tomato production should be attributed to the maximum comprehensive benefit of kue wue and physiological indexes this study showed that the w80k80 treatment had the optimal comprehensive benefit which had higher tomato yield kue wue quality and physiological indexes the w80k80 treatment achieved the highest yield in both years the vc soluble sugar and soluble solids in w80k80 treatment were 9 3 25 3 10 2 20 0 and 3 3 13 9 higher in 2020 and 5 6 28 3 10 2 24 1 and 0 1 10 0 higher in 2021 than those in the others k fertilization treatments respectively meanwhile the kue and wue were higher in the w80k80 treatment this was because that the suitable soil water conditions combined with 80 crk 20 kcl improved ctk contents in tomato roots and leaves and promoted the growth of tomato plants and the development of fruits at the same time favorable growth conditions promoted the increase of leaf rubisco content inhibited the increase of h2o2 and mda contents improved the net photosynthetic rate and increased nutrient accumulation similar observations were made by wang et al 2015 5 conclusions this study showed that irrigation level and crk to kcl blending ratio strategies had an obvious interaction on tomato yield quality and water k use efficiency under the interactive effect of 80 irrigation level 80 crk and 20 kcl mixtures combination the soil available k supply was consistent with the demand of tomato in the process of greenhouse tomato furthermore the aba and ctk contents h2o2 and mda contents in leaves and roots and the rubisco and osmotic regulation substances content in leaves reached the proper level which significantly improved leaves photosynthetic rate and increased the fruit yield and quality meanwhile the w80k80 treatment saved irrigation water by 20 and enhanced kue wue by 11 5 7 9 in 2020 and 9 3 8 6 in 2021 respectively compared with w100k80 treatment considering the tradeoff between yields quality kue and wue the w80k80 treatment was the best water and k management strategy for greenhouse tomato cultivation in the yellow river basin of china in the future greenhouse tomato cultivation farmers can apply controlled release mixed potassium fertilizer 80 crk and 20 kcl while performing deficit irrigation 20 reduction of irrigation amount compared with conventional irrigation amount which will not only help to reduce the input of water and fertilizer resources but also achieve the goal of stable increased tomato yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

9754,efficient utilization of the limited water and land resources is critical for global development with a growing population the widespread saline land remains an important reserved land resource for food security this study investigated the performance of the raised field shallow trench pattern on salt removal and water budget in the cotton field by a virtual experiment the widely used physically based hydrus 2d 3d model was used to implement different raise field elevations and slopes results showed that the raised land could control the soil salinity in the unsaturated root zone by intensifying the drainage compared with the flat land the desalination effect of the raised land was more effective with the gentler slope and higher raised elevation without irrigation the 30 and 45 slope raised lands had slight effect on the soil salinity in the unsaturated root zone salt removal would be more effective with the addition of irrigation with the desalination ratio ranging from 10 60 to 41 01 under fresh irrigation or from 6 76 to 25 92 under saline irrigation respectively more importantly the implementation of irrigation effectively improved the cotton root water uptake and saline water irrigation for the 15 slope raised field was proved to nearly meets the cotton water requirement therefore the raised field shallow trench pattern combined with saline water irrigation may provide local farmers with an alternative solution to saline land reclamation under fresh water scarcity keywords raised field saline water use root water uptake yellow river delta hydrus 2d 3d 1 introduction global food security remains a significant challenge with the rapid growth of the worldwide population united nations 2019 in china the population will peak in 2030 and then 776 mt of grain is needed to feed its people li et al 2014c considering the crop yield stagnation and yield ceiling tao et al 2015 chen et al 2017a 2017b the critical reserved land resource such as the saline land could expand the cultivated area and contribute to total food production however salinity and waterlogging in the saline land have limited agricultural production in many areas for more than 2000 years yellow river delta yrd at the lowest reaches of the yellow river is one of china s most typical saline land areas the salinization in yrd is mainly caused by shallow groundwater with high salinity besides short of fresh water resources also restricts local food production in the yrd the total water supply amount is 37 8 108 m3 yr of which 21 7 108 m3 yr 53 4 is withdrawn from the yellow river the percentage of agricultural water use reaches up to 80 4 pang et al 2014 ouyang et al 2020 additionally to promote the ecological conservation and high quality development of the yellow river basin more water would be allocated to ecology construction which would aggravate the water shortage for agriculture to meet the crop water demand the brackish or saline water resources of 2 10 g l whose distribution accounts for 56 71 in yrd pang et al 2016 catches the attention of agricultural scientists the conjunctive use of surface water and shallow groundwater shows great potential to guarantee the agricultural production however the use of shallow saline groundwater has both positive and negative effects on crop production xue et al 2018 on the one hand the shallow groundwater can alleviate the water stress in the crop root zone on the other hand the soluble salt in groundwater will also aggravate the root zone salt accumulation limit the root water uptake and even decrease crop yield previous studies on shallow saline groundwater contribution to crop growth evapotranspiration have revealed that groundwater table depth is the primary determinant factor for crop production rather than the water salinity kruse et al 1993 xue et al 2018 that is properly controlling the groundwater table could help to maintain normal crop growth and production under heavy saline groundwater conditions the yrd is a low gradient floodplain most parts are 10 m with a plain slope of 0 0001 shi et al 2003 lying at the transitional zone of the bohai sea and the north china plain there is always a continuous supplement of salts and water from the sea thus it is challenging to effectively control groundwater table through traditional measures such as the construction of drainage canal tile drainage etc in this case microtopography modification is more ecological and water cost effective as an indirect way to change groundwater table depth and to restore the saline land wang et al 2020 as one main measure of microtopography modification the raised field is actually a large elevated planting platform with improved soil condition and has been applied in the saline alkali land reclamation in hai river basin since the 1960s chen 1965 li 1965a 1965b wang et al 1965 the raised field combined with a shallow trench has recently been proposed as an integrated land use pattern li et al 2014b in this pattern the water resource preservation ability is also improved by collecting both the discharged water from the raised field and the rainfall wang et al 2020 generally crop growth greatly relies on root water uptake the rooting depth is highly sensitive to local soil water distribution determined by precipitation infiltration characteristics reflecting influence of local climate and soil and groundwater table dynamics reflecting topography driven land drainage fan et al 2017 which provided the essential basis for agricultural water management therefore it was assumed that the raised field could prolong the root depth and provide a larger area for water uptake groundwater recharge amount and salinity are significant for groundwater dependent ecosystems and various land use patterns the height of the raised field is the key factor to control soil salinity however the appropriate height derived from different studies are variable li et al 2014 reviewed the previous studies on the raised field and concluded that the height increment should be at least 1 7 m over the original soil surface for crop growth the raised field with a distance of 1 9 m from the groundwater table was suitable jia et al 2018 while in the application of saline land restoration the relatively high soil altitude of 1 2 m is beneficial to salt removal wang et al 2020 besides the edge of the raised land is shaped as a slope to reduce the risk of soil slide and the slope gradient ranges from 1 1 to 1 2 varying with different soil textures li 1965a given the limited fresh water resources in the yrd the raised field s size need to be further optimized based on the crop water demand and its salt tolerance calculating the amount of soil available water to the plant is difficult because of lacking information of plant root distribution depth and architecture and crop root interactions with soil water under salt stress condition for this the hydrological model could be used to predict long term soil water dynamics under different land use patterns and provide useful guideline for agricultural water management in water limited areas burnett et al 2020 to understand the underlying mechanisms and prepare for a practical application it might benefit from having a virtual experiment e g by a model scenarios analysis for this purpose a widely used physically based hydrus model is preferred šimůnek et al 2012 2018 therefore the main objectives of this study are 1 to compare the salt removing effects of different raised field shallow trench setup including the height and edge slope 2 to analyze the crop evapotranspiration supplied from the raised field shallow trench pattern and 3 to optimize the detailed parameters of the raised field shallow trench pattern by a physical based model simulation 2 methods and materials 2 1 general situation of the yrd the yrd is situated at the northeast of shandong province china fig 1 the climate in yrd is a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 12 9 with minimum and maximum mean daily temperatures of 2 8 in january and 26 7 in july the average annual precipitation is 530 630 mm of which 70 is in the summer the average annual evaporation is 1900 2400 mm there are six landform types and eight land cover types in the yrd cotton and cornfields are mainly distributed in the inland area and the pasture grassland and planted forest robina pseudoacacia and salix matsudana koidz in the central part the swamp and salt marsh are widespread in the north and east parts of yrd fig 1 the soil type gradually varies from fluvo aquic to saline soil and the soil texture is mainly sandy clay loam yu et al 2014 han et al 2018 the groundwater table is shallow with an average depth of 1 14 m and the salinity averaging 14 3 g l influenced by the tidal process and the yellow river runoff fan et al 2010 during the dry season april july the strong evaporation drives water and soluble salt in the shallow water table transporting upward to the root zone therefore the surface soil moisture and salinity are relatively high 2 2 raised field design the raised field is constructed by digging around soil and pile at the center which produces a height increment for the raised soil surface compared with the original flat land as a result the groundwater table depth increases at the raised field the edge of the raised field is usually shaped as a slope for stability so the raised field in geometric view is a cone frustum fig 2 simultaneously the dug part surrounding the raised field forms a trench that collects the discharged water and rainfall to figure out the optimal size parameter of the raised field that could support crop growth and control soil salinization three height increments δh 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m and three slopes θslope 15 30 and 45 are set for simulation scenarios all these modifications are based on the initial flat land with a radius of 10 m table 1 meanwhile the initial flat land condition is also simulated to compare and illustrate the salt removing effects of different raised fields cotton is chosen to present the crop field evapotranspiration dynamics because of its high salt tolerance moreover three irrigation regimes no irrigation irrigation with fresh water irrigation with saline water are applied before and during the crop growing season given that the seasonal drought in yrd is pronounced there will be two pre sowing irrigations before the growing season to flush the salt in the root zone and provide water content during the seedling stage the salt content of the fresh and saline irrigation water is 0 5 g l and 14 3 g l respectively table 2 shows the schedule of the irrigation events and amounts that are based on the local practices 2 3 numerical model the 2d axisymmetrical vertical flow module is used to simulate the water and salt distributions under the conditions of different raised field designs coupled with varying irrigation regimes the governing equation for variably saturated water flow is a modified version of richard equation richards 1931

distribution function cm 2 and a logistic growth function characterizes the root growth the maximum root depths in different raised lands and flat land are specified at the depth where remains 14 cm above from the water table considering the capillary rise he et al 2017 except that in the 2 m height increment raised fields the maximum root depth in the 2 m height increment raised fields keeps the same as that in 1 5 m height increments reaching the most depth of cotton root in this study area li 2001 s t is the soil surface area associated with transpiration confined at the platform part of the raised field and t p is the potential transpiration rate cm day the actual crop root water uptake is taken as the actual transpiration in the hydrus model the multiplicative model is used to simulate the combined effect of water and salinity stress the water uptake reduction function feddes et al 1978 is used to quantify the effect of water stress on evapotranspiration the parameters related to water uptake reduction include p 0 the pressure head below which roots start to extract soil water 10 cm p opt the pressure head below which roots extract water at the maximum possible rate

et al 2014 the threshold slope model maas and hoffman 1977 is used to simulate salinity stress the threshold salinity for cotton is 7 7 ms cm electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract and the corresponding slope value is 5 2 it is worth noting that these values should be converted into salt concentration of soil water according to the investigated relationship between the electrical

the hysteresis effect was not considered in the study the salt concentration in soil water c was used as the non reactive solute to determine the variations in salinity throughout the simulated soil

is the effective dispersion coefficient cm2 day the longitudinal dispersivity is set at 50 cm according to the similar soil conditions in li et al 2015 and transverse dispersivity is set at 1 10 of longitudinal dispersivity molecular diffusion was assumed to be negligible in the study and then q i is the water flux cm2 day computed from eq 1 the subscripts i and j denote either x or z coordinates plant solute uptake was also not considered in the study the initial soil water content is set as field capacity and the initial soil salinity is specified as the average salt content of the whole soil profile based on the field observation the salt content is assumed to be completely dissolved by the soil water the platform part of the soil surface is set as an atmospheric boundary condition while the slope part of the soil surface above the water table is set as a seepage face boundary given that the slope surface of the raised field receives rainfall and evaporates soil water when there is no seepage the boundary condition is further set as apply atmospheric boundary condition to nonactive seepage face which is the new feature of version 3 of the hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2018 the bottom of the simulation domain is appointed as a constant head boundary condition the immersed slope under the water table is defined as a constant head condition in hydrostatic equilibrium with the pressure head of the lowest boundary the left vertical boundary is treated as no flux boundary because of the raised field s symmetrical characteristic the third type cauchy boundary condition is defined across the platform soil surface the whole slope and the bottom for solute transport potential evaporation e p and transpiration t p in the hydrus model were calculated ritchie

the local cotton cultivation li 2001 the multi year meteorological data from china meteorological data sharing service system at kenli meteorological station is used in the simulation lowry and loheide 2010 defined the extra water transpired by the plant from shallow groundwater as a groundwater subsidy calculated as the difference between root water uptake under shallow groundwater conditions and free drainage conditions the hydrus model is rerun by assigning the lower boundary as a free drainage condition assuming no groundwater influence to determine the contribution to crop evapotranspiration from the shallow groundwater and the former immersed slope part is changed to the seepage face simultaneously as imposed on the slope part above the water table then the difference of evaporation or transpiration between shallow groundwater and free drainage conditions is the contribution from groundwater the differential water flow equation in hydrus 2d 3d was solved using the galerkin type linear finite element method for a triangular network šimůnek et al 2012 the whole model domain was discretized into 812 1501 finite elements varying with different raised fields sizes with fine grids 20 cm at the atmospheric boundary which gradually increased to 50 cm with increasing depth to the bottom of the simulation domain all irrigation scenarios were simulated in the hydrus model for 5 consecutive years and the 5th growing season was analyzed for a stable drainage water output and soil salinity distribution the desalination ratio refers to the salinity reduction percentage in the crop root zone during the growing season eq 10 which is used to compare the salt removal effects in this study 10 d r s w s r z s t a r t s w s r z e n d s w s r z s t a r t where dr is the desalination ratio sws rz start and sws rz end are the soil water salinity g l in the root zone at the start and end of the growing season respectively 3 results 3 1 salt removing effects of the raised field shallow trench pattern fig 3 shows the soil salinity distribution at the end of the growing season in the flat land the average soil water salinity of the unsaturated zone where crop root develops is 27 19 g l under no irrigation condition with a desalination ratio of 17 96 table 3 when irrigation is applied on the heavily saline land the average soil water salinity in the unsaturated zone decreases to 7 37 g l under fresh irrigation condition showing a prominent salt removal effect after five year reclamation the desalination ratio under fresh irrigation is only 0 87 because of the relatively low soil salinity within the root zone the salt removing effect remains limited under saline irrigation condition the average soil water salinity in the root zone is 20 45 g l and the desalination ratio is 0 49 at the end of the growing season the negative desalination ratio under saline irrigation means that the soluble salt has accumulated in the root zone during the growing season which might be caused by the shallow and saline groundwater the raised land could control the salt distribution within the root zone by prolonging the depth to the groundwater table under no irrigation conditions fig 4 the 30 50 cm soil layer presents a relatively low salinity zone especially at the slope of the raised field where no root water uptake occurs the relatively low salinity area expands with the increasing height increments δh but shrinks with the steeper slopes the soil salt flocks down to the lower soil layer influencing crop root development and water uptake when the slope of the raised field is 15 the average soil salinity in the unsaturated profile is lower than that in flat land and decreases with the increasing height with the desalination ratio rising from 24 01 at 1 m height increment to 30 71 at 2 m height increment when the slope is added up to 30 or 45 the average soil salinity reaches more than 27 g l and the corresponding desalination ratio decreases to nearly 18 table 3 it means that the salt removing effect of the raised field is restricted at steeper slope conditions when there is no extra irrigation combined with irrigation the raised land could control soil salinity better fig 5 6 the trend of soil salinity varies similarly to that under no irrigation conditions increasing with the steeper slopes nevertheless the height increments show different effects on the soil salinity under various slope conditions the soil salinity decreases with the higher height under 15 and 30 slope conditions but increases under 45 slope conditions the average soil water salinity of the root zone at 15 30 and 45 slopes under fresh irrigation are 1 77 5 33 and 7 51 g l respectively those under saline irrigation conditions are 11 56 16 40 and 18 55 g l respectively table 3 compared with the irrigated flat land the average soil salinity under fresh and saline irrigation conditions reduces by 76 0 and 43 5 at 15 slope by 27 7 and 19 8 at 30 slope at the 45 slope raised field the average soil salinity of the root zone under saline irrigation reduces by only 9 3 compared with the irrigated flat land while that under fresh irrigation increases by 1 9 due to the extended root zone the salt removing effects of the raised field at 15 slope is the most obvious with the desalination ratios averaging 33 85 and 21 44 under fresh and saline irrigation conditions the average desalination ratio decreases to 16 59 and 10 82 at 30 slope to 11 10 and 7 48 at 45 slope under fresh and saline irrigation conditions with the extending depth to groundwater the desalination ratio of different raised fields shows an increasing trend under both fresh and saline irrigation conditions table 3 moreover the soil water content in different raised lands remains relatively high at the end of the growing season ranging from 32 8 to 37 1 the average soil water content slightly decreases with the steeper slope and the extended depth to the groundwater table but without significant differences data not shown the flat land condition performs the largest soil moisture of 38 4 due to the shallowest groundwater 3 2 influences of the raised field shallow trench pattern on crop transpiration intensive evaporation is one of the main drivers of salinization the evaporation is nearly 282 6 mm no matter in flat land or raised lands nevertheless transpiration varies among different raised fields under no irrigation scenario the transpiration in flat land is 150 37 mm and ranges from 180 01 to 218 12 mm in the 15 slope raised fields increasing with the higher height the transpiration in the 30 and 45 slope raised field conditions is lower than flat land ranging from 107 47 to 134 86 mm and decreasing with the higher height table 4 the transpiration increases considerably with the salt flushing effect of irrigation water infiltration under fresh and saline water irrigation conditions the increased percentage of transpiration in flat land is 168 04 and 85 03 under fresh and saline irrigation conditions furthermore crop transpiration improvement is more obvious in the raised fields under fresh and saline irrigation conditions the average transpiration in the 15 slope raised field is 403 18 and 350 69 mm when the slope of the raised field is added up to 30 or 45 the average transpiration decreases slightly to 403 06 or 402 20 mm under fresh water irrigation to 303 37 or 287 55 mm under saline water irrigation condition table 4 compared with the irrigated flat land the percentage of improved transpiration in the saline irrigated raised fields of 15 30 and 45 slopes are 26 04 9 03 and 3 35 respectively while the improvement percentage of transpiration is relatively small in fresh irrigated raised fields compared to the fresh irrigated flat land these results mean that crop root water uptake in saline land could be improved significantly by irrigation when fresh water resources are available the improvement is prominent in both flat land or raised lands when saline water is applied due to scarce fresh water the improvement of transpiration would be better combined with a gentle slope 15 or 30 raised field construction 3 3 contribution of groundwater to crop evapotranspiration in the raised field shallow trench pattern the similar water budget in different raised fields and flat land is analyzed by assigning the lower boundary as a free drainage condition assuming no groundwater influence table 5 when there is no irrigation the evaporation in flat land is 249 30 mm lowering by 11 77 compared to shallow groundwater conditions the evaporation in raised fields reduces to 251 79 255 98 mm with a reduction percentage of about 10 meanwhile the transpiration under free drainage conditions increases significantly compared to shallow saline groundwater conditions resulting from the effective rainfall leaching along with the free drainage water the average transpiration increases by 6 56 in flat land and over 60 00 in the raised fields when irrigation is applied the evaporation under both fresh and saline water irrigation conditions shows little difference between free drainage and shallow groundwater conditions compared to saline irrigation with shallow groundwater conditions the transpiration for free drainage conditions decreases by 15 95 mm in the flat land and increases by several millimeters in the raised fields on the contrary the fresh irrigated flat land and raised fields transpiration under free drainage conditions are lower than shallow groundwater conditions the reason could be the improved soil conditions with shallow groundwater facilitated by fresh irrigation which promotes an increase in root water uptake from shallow groundwater it is worth noting that the changes in soil water storage δs are all negative in the raised fields under free drainage conditions which is caused by the larger quantity of drainage water table 5 the evapotranspiration originated from the shallow groundwater etg can be determined from the differences between the evapotranspiration with shallow groundwater conditions and under free drainage conditions the etg and its separation of eg evaporation from groundwater and tg transpiration from groundwater are shown in table 6 the shallow groundwater supplies considerable evaporation through capillary rise under no irrigation scenarios the eg is 33 26 mm in flat land and ranges from 26 55 to 30 74 mm in the raised land under no irrigation conditions decreasing slightly along with the rising height the irrigation events may suppress the capillary rise thus the eg is ignorable under both fresh and saline water irrigation conditions the intensive evaporation under no irrigation condition may bring out heavy salt cumulation in the root zone inhibiting crop root water uptake and then the actual transpiration table 3 the negative values of tg in table 6 suggest that the shallow saline groundwater restricts crop transpiration rather than contributes to it when there is no irrigation the transpiration reduces by 9 87 mm in flat land by 96 33 133 11 mm at 15 slope by 77 05 103 57 mm at 30 slope and by 67 93 85 90 mm at 45 slope raised fields in the presence of shallow groundwater compared to that under free drainage conditions respectively table 4 5 the decrement in transpiration goes more serious with higher height and becomes smaller with the steeper slopes under saline irrigation conditions the magnitude of tg still be negative increases to several millimeters in raised land indicating that shallow groundwater inhibition to crop transpiration is mitigated by saline irrigation the tg in different raised lands and flat land under fresh water irrigation performs positive values ranging from 5 15 to 14 83 mm which means groundwater contribution to crop transpiration etg is the comprehensive effects of groundwater on cotton evapotranspiration table 6 under no irrigation condition 23 40 mm of etg is supplied from the groundwater in flat land while etg becomes negative in the raised field due to the dominant inhibition effect on root water uptake the inhibition effect on et from the shallow groundwater is ameliorated under both fresh and saline water irrigations especially under fresh irrigation the inhibition effect changes to be the contribution effect the inhibition on etg caused by shallow groundwater is also improved by the increasing height at the 15 slope raised land under saline irrigation conditions however the increasing height increment can not alleviate the inhibition effect on etg any more at the 30 and 45 slope raised land with saline irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 the mechanism of the raised field on salt removal the nature of saline land reclamation is to remove the soluble salt from the root zone through the infiltration and discharge of a certain amount of precipitation irrigation water it is extremely difficult to flush the salt out of the root zone with continuously saline shallow groundwater there is no way out for the drainage water across the flat land coupled with the extensively distributed saline shallow groundwater akça et al 2020 found that microtopographic condition is one of the most effective factors for salinity building up apart from soil texture and saline shallow water table it has been reported that raised field can facilitate salt removal in coastal saline areas li et al 2014b jing et al 2011 dong et al 2011 the artificial islands a specially raised field with slope have been implemented to restore degraded wetlands the island s slope is believed to play a critical role in enabling effective drainage and promoting the release of soil salt wang et al 2020 however our study reveals that the salinity in the slope of the raised field remains at a relatively low level at the end of the growing season figs 5 7 that means the leachate with high salinity after irrigation or rainfall is not discharged through the slope in this study the slope above the water table is set as an atmospheric boundary condition when the seepage face is nonactive which is more realistic considering the precipitation infiltration and soil evaporation on the slope interestingly the water flux across the slope above the water table is similar to the platform part with a mere atmospheric boundary which means no significant seepage flow out across the slope it is verified by assigning a mere seepage face at the slope the results of seepage flux still are zero furthermore the velocity vectors after pre sowing irrigation are illustrated in fig 7 which displays the flow direction in the raised field and provides another evidence for the outlet of the saline drainage thus we can conclude that the raised land s desalination is not easy to discharge salt through the slope this study s general results show that the higher raised field is beneficial for salt removal positively correlated with the drainage amount especially under fresh irrigation conditions r 0 74 p 0 05 moreover the gentler slope gradient of the raised field is also conductive to drainage due to the wider outlet in the trench the salt removal effect in raised land is based on the intensified drainage across the lower boundary this agrees well with the nature as mentioned above of saline land reclamation 4 2 the influence of shallow groundwater to crop evapotranspiration shallow groundwater could contribute to the crop evapotranspiration and yield through the capillary rise forming a groundwater subsidy zipper et al 2015 soylu et al 2014 earlier scientists have quantified the groundwater subsidy to cotton evapotranspiration by lysimeter experiments for instance namken et al 1969 found that groundwater contributed 54 26 and 17 of the total cotton evapotranspiration with the water tables at 0 91 1 83 and 2 74 m respectively hutmacher et al 1996 noted that the total cotton evapotranspiration contribution from the shallow groundwater 120 cm water depth of 20 ds m was about 30 42 and declined to 12 19 at higher salinity levels the contribution percentage of groundwater to the evapotranspiration is much strongly affected by water table depth than groundwater salinity kruse et al 1993 xue et al 2018 however groundwater contribution to cotton evapotranspiration under saline irrigation is inhibited in this study the relatively high initial soil salinity leads to the inhibition effect the average soil water salinity in the root zone is greater than cotton s salt tolerance threshold in some scenarios even the reclamation has been conducting for five years it is worth noting that the inhibition effects still exsited even at 15 slope raised fields with small height increment the cotton evapotranspiration at 15 slope raised fields averages 633 25 mm decreasing to 585 95 mm at 30 slope and to 570 10 mm at 45 slope under saline irrigation conditions the results indicate that the raised field with a gentle slope 15 and large height increment δh 1 5 or 2 m combined with saline irrigation could nearly meet the local cotton water requirement 650 7 mm under full irrigation conditions duan 2004 besides when the simulation is extended to 10 years we find that the desalination ratio in the raised fields with saline irrigation will stabilize after 5 year reclamation without obvious salt building up fig 8 note that the shallow trench around the raised field can also harvest the natural rainfall or even runoff from around sites that may be added as fresh water for irrigation which is out of this study s research scope and will be studied in the future in summary raised field shallow trench provides an alternative solution to saline land reclamation under fresh water scarcity 4 3 implications and limitations of the study this study indicates that the raised field shallow trench pattern could extend large crop cultivated area to ensure food security in the saline areas with shallow groundwater the cotton is planted only at the platform part in the raised field which results in lower land use efficiency than traditional plantation in the flat land nevertheless this study presents the production potential at the slope with relatively low soil salinity it will offset the lower land use efficiency and strengthen the slope stability by growing crop the virtual experiment by model simulation is a convenient fast and cost effective way to optimize the size parameters of the raised field design however several limitations should be considered in evaluating the saline land reclamation in addition to the model verification by field data firstly the shallow groundwater is set constant in terms of the water table and water salinity the assumption is different from the real situation because this boundary condition allows drainage water to flow out of the domain without raising the water table or changing salinity while the groundwater table and salinity will fluctuate when irrigation or rainfall occurs future research should include the fluctuation of the groundwater table and the varying salinity in the heavily saline cotton planting area sun et al 2012 has demonstrated the feasibility of changing drainage into impoundment in the raised field shallow trench pattern and identified the mechanism of salt removal by cycling water between the waterbody in a trench and the soil along with changes in water level secondly the effects of the groundwater fluctuation to crop root water uptake remains unknown which is limited to a great extent by the vague understanding and parameterization of the interaction between root and soil certainly this is also a crop type dependent hence future research should also reveal groundwater replenishment to the soil root zone and its contribution to soil evaporation and crop transpiration using more crop types and quantify the impact of different groundwater conditions on groundwater subsidies thirdly the soil texture is taken as homogeneous throughout the field profile in this study soil textural heterogeneity which caused the differences in soil water potential has been associated with salt and water transport wang et al 2017 li et al 2014a li 1965a also suggested the distribution of different soil textures would influence crop growth nevertheless it is interesting to investigate how different soil types in one research area influence the salt removal mechanism due to the construction of the raised field 5 conclusion the raised field is an effective measure for the reclamation of saline land with shallow groundwater the raised land prolongs the depth to the groundwater table and enhances the drainage at the lower boundary the gentler slope and higher height are more favorable for salt removal the 30 and 45 slope raised lands without irrigation cannot reduce the soil salinity in the unsaturated root zone any more compared with the flat land considering the current fresh water scarcity situation the raised field shallow trench combined with saline water irrigation could meet the water requirement of some salt tolerant crops such as cotton this production pattern creates great potential for water saving and food security acknowledgments the research was funded by the national

9754,efficient utilization of the limited water and land resources is critical for global development with a growing population the widespread saline land remains an important reserved land resource for food security this study investigated the performance of the raised field shallow trench pattern on salt removal and water budget in the cotton field by a virtual experiment the widely used physically based hydrus 2d 3d model was used to implement different raise field elevations and slopes results showed that the raised land could control the soil salinity in the unsaturated root zone by intensifying the drainage compared with the flat land the desalination effect of the raised land was more effective with the gentler slope and higher raised elevation without irrigation the 30 and 45 slope raised lands had slight effect on the soil salinity in the unsaturated root zone salt removal would be more effective with the addition of irrigation with the desalination ratio ranging from 10 60 to 41 01 under fresh irrigation or from 6 76 to 25 92 under saline irrigation respectively more importantly the implementation of irrigation effectively improved the cotton root water uptake and saline water irrigation for the 15 slope raised field was proved to nearly meets the cotton water requirement therefore the raised field shallow trench pattern combined with saline water irrigation may provide local farmers with an alternative solution to saline land reclamation under fresh water scarcity keywords raised field saline water use root water uptake yellow river delta hydrus 2d 3d 1 introduction global food security remains a significant challenge with the rapid growth of the worldwide population united nations 2019 in china the population will peak in 2030 and then 776 mt of grain is needed to feed its people li et al 2014c considering the crop yield stagnation and yield ceiling tao et al 2015 chen et al 2017a 2017b the critical reserved land resource such as the saline land could expand the cultivated area and contribute to total food production however salinity and waterlogging in the saline land have limited agricultural production in many areas for more than 2000 years yellow river delta yrd at the lowest reaches of the yellow river is one of china s most typical saline land areas the salinization in yrd is mainly caused by shallow groundwater with high salinity besides short of fresh water resources also restricts local food production in the yrd the total water supply amount is 37 8 108 m3 yr of which 21 7 108 m3 yr 53 4 is withdrawn from the yellow river the percentage of agricultural water use reaches up to 80 4 pang et al 2014 ouyang et al 2020 additionally to promote the ecological conservation and high quality development of the yellow river basin more water would be allocated to ecology construction which would aggravate the water shortage for agriculture to meet the crop water demand the brackish or saline water resources of 2 10 g l whose distribution accounts for 56 71 in yrd pang et al 2016 catches the attention of agricultural scientists the conjunctive use of surface water and shallow groundwater shows great potential to guarantee the agricultural production however the use of shallow saline groundwater has both positive and negative effects on crop production xue et al 2018 on the one hand the shallow groundwater can alleviate the water stress in the crop root zone on the other hand the soluble salt in groundwater will also aggravate the root zone salt accumulation limit the root water uptake and even decrease crop yield previous studies on shallow saline groundwater contribution to crop growth evapotranspiration have revealed that groundwater table depth is the primary determinant factor for crop production rather than the water salinity kruse et al 1993 xue et al 2018 that is properly controlling the groundwater table could help to maintain normal crop growth and production under heavy saline groundwater conditions the yrd is a low gradient floodplain most parts are 10 m with a plain slope of 0 0001 shi et al 2003 lying at the transitional zone of the bohai sea and the north china plain there is always a continuous supplement of salts and water from the sea thus it is challenging to effectively control groundwater table through traditional measures such as the construction of drainage canal tile drainage etc in this case microtopography modification is more ecological and water cost effective as an indirect way to change groundwater table depth and to restore the saline land wang et al 2020 as one main measure of microtopography modification the raised field is actually a large elevated planting platform with improved soil condition and has been applied in the saline alkali land reclamation in hai river basin since the 1960s chen 1965 li 1965a 1965b wang et al 1965 the raised field combined with a shallow trench has recently been proposed as an integrated land use pattern li et al 2014b in this pattern the water resource preservation ability is also improved by collecting both the discharged water from the raised field and the rainfall wang et al 2020 generally crop growth greatly relies on root water uptake the rooting depth is highly sensitive to local soil water distribution determined by precipitation infiltration characteristics reflecting influence of local climate and soil and groundwater table dynamics reflecting topography driven land drainage fan et al 2017 which provided the essential basis for agricultural water management therefore it was assumed that the raised field could prolong the root depth and provide a larger area for water uptake groundwater recharge amount and salinity are significant for groundwater dependent ecosystems and various land use patterns the height of the raised field is the key factor to control soil salinity however the appropriate height derived from different studies are variable li et al 2014 reviewed the previous studies on the raised field and concluded that the height increment should be at least 1 7 m over the original soil surface for crop growth the raised field with a distance of 1 9 m from the groundwater table was suitable jia et al 2018 while in the application of saline land restoration the relatively high soil altitude of 1 2 m is beneficial to salt removal wang et al 2020 besides the edge of the raised land is shaped as a slope to reduce the risk of soil slide and the slope gradient ranges from 1 1 to 1 2 varying with different soil textures li 1965a given the limited fresh water resources in the yrd the raised field s size need to be further optimized based on the crop water demand and its salt tolerance calculating the amount of soil available water to the plant is difficult because of lacking information of plant root distribution depth and architecture and crop root interactions with soil water under salt stress condition for this the hydrological model could be used to predict long term soil water dynamics under different land use patterns and provide useful guideline for agricultural water management in water limited areas burnett et al 2020 to understand the underlying mechanisms and prepare for a practical application it might benefit from having a virtual experiment e g by a model scenarios analysis for this purpose a widely used physically based hydrus model is preferred šimůnek et al 2012 2018 therefore the main objectives of this study are 1 to compare the salt removing effects of different raised field shallow trench setup including the height and edge slope 2 to analyze the crop evapotranspiration supplied from the raised field shallow trench pattern and 3 to optimize the detailed parameters of the raised field shallow trench pattern by a physical based model simulation 2 methods and materials 2 1 general situation of the yrd the yrd is situated at the northeast of shandong province china fig 1 the climate in yrd is a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 12 9 with minimum and maximum mean daily temperatures of 2 8 in january and 26 7 in july the average annual precipitation is 530 630 mm of which 70 is in the summer the average annual evaporation is 1900 2400 mm there are six landform types and eight land cover types in the yrd cotton and cornfields are mainly distributed in the inland area and the pasture grassland and planted forest robina pseudoacacia and salix matsudana koidz in the central part the swamp and salt marsh are widespread in the north and east parts of yrd fig 1 the soil type gradually varies from fluvo aquic to saline soil and the soil texture is mainly sandy clay loam yu et al 2014 han et al 2018 the groundwater table is shallow with an average depth of 1 14 m and the salinity averaging 14 3 g l influenced by the tidal process and the yellow river runoff fan et al 2010 during the dry season april july the strong evaporation drives water and soluble salt in the shallow water table transporting upward to the root zone therefore the surface soil moisture and salinity are relatively high 2 2 raised field design the raised field is constructed by digging around soil and pile at the center which produces a height increment for the raised soil surface compared with the original flat land as a result the groundwater table depth increases at the raised field the edge of the raised field is usually shaped as a slope for stability so the raised field in geometric view is a cone frustum fig 2 simultaneously the dug part surrounding the raised field forms a trench that collects the discharged water and rainfall to figure out the optimal size parameter of the raised field that could support crop growth and control soil salinization three height increments δh 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m and three slopes θslope 15 30 and 45 are set for simulation scenarios all these modifications are based on the initial flat land with a radius of 10 m table 1 meanwhile the initial flat land condition is also simulated to compare and illustrate the salt removing effects of different raised fields cotton is chosen to present the crop field evapotranspiration dynamics because of its high salt tolerance moreover three irrigation regimes no irrigation irrigation with fresh water irrigation with saline water are applied before and during the crop growing season given that the seasonal drought in yrd is pronounced there will be two pre sowing irrigations before the growing season to flush the salt in the root zone and provide water content during the seedling stage the salt content of the fresh and saline irrigation water is 0 5 g l and 14 3 g l respectively table 2 shows the schedule of the irrigation events and amounts that are based on the local practices 2 3 numerical model the 2d axisymmetrical vertical flow module is used to simulate the water and salt distributions under the conditions of different raised field designs coupled with varying irrigation regimes the governing equation for variably saturated water flow is a modified version of richard equation richards 1931

et al 2014 the threshold slope model maas and hoffman 1977 is used to simulate salinity stress the threshold salinity for cotton is 7 7 ms cm electrical conductivity of soil saturation extract and the corresponding slope value is 5 2 it is worth noting that these values should be converted into salt concentration of soil water according to the investigated relationship between the electrical

coordinates plant solute uptake was also not considered in the study the initial soil water content is set as field capacity and the initial soil salinity is specified as the average salt content of the whole soil profile based on the field observation the salt content is assumed to be completely dissolved by the soil water the platform part of the soil surface is set as an atmospheric boundary condition while the slope part of the soil surface above the water table is set as a seepage face boundary given that the slope surface of the raised field receives rainfall and evaporates soil water when there is no seepage the boundary condition is further set as apply atmospheric boundary condition to nonactive seepage face which is the new feature of version 3 of the hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2018 the bottom of the simulation domain is appointed as a constant head boundary condition the immersed slope under the water table is defined as a constant head condition in hydrostatic equilibrium

loheide 2010 defined the extra water transpired by the plant from shallow groundwater as a groundwater subsidy calculated as the difference between root water uptake under shallow groundwater conditions and free drainage conditions the hydrus model is rerun by assigning the lower boundary as a free drainage condition assuming no groundwater influence to determine the contribution to crop evapotranspiration from the shallow groundwater and the former immersed slope part is changed to the seepage face simultaneously as imposed on the slope part above the water table then the difference of evaporation or transpiration between shallow groundwater and free drainage conditions is the contribution from groundwater the differential water flow equation in hydrus 2d 3d was solved using the galerkin type linear finite element method for a triangular network šimůnek et al 2012 the whole model domain was discretized into 812 1501 finite elements varying with different raised fields sizes with fine grids 20 cm at the atmospheric boundary which gradually increased to 50 cm with increasing depth to the bottom of the simulation domain all irrigation scenarios were simulated in the hydrus model for 5 consecutive years and the 5th growing season was analyzed for a stable drainage water output and soil salinity distribution the desalination ratio refers to the salinity reduction percentage in the crop root zone during the growing season eq 10 which is used to compare the salt removal effects in this study 10 d r s w s r z s t a r t s w s r z e n d s w s r z s t a r t where dr is the desalination ratio sws rz start and sws rz end are the soil water salinity g l in the root zone at the start and end of the growing season respectively 3 results 3 1 salt removing effects of the raised field shallow trench pattern fig 3 shows the soil salinity distribution at the end of the growing season in the flat land the average soil water salinity of the unsaturated zone where crop root develops is 27 19 g l under no irrigation condition with a desalination ratio of 17 96 table 3 when irrigation is applied on the heavily saline land the average soil water salinity in the unsaturated zone decreases to 7 37 g l under fresh irrigation condition showing a prominent salt removal effect after five year reclamation the desalination ratio under fresh irrigation is only 0 87 because of the relatively low soil salinity within the root zone the salt removing effect remains limited under saline irrigation condition the average soil water salinity in the root zone is 20 45 g l and the desalination ratio is 0 49 at the end of the growing season the negative desalination ratio under saline irrigation means that the soluble salt has accumulated in the root zone during the growing season which might be caused by the shallow and saline groundwater the raised land could control the salt distribution within the root zone by prolonging the depth to the groundwater table under no irrigation conditions fig 4 the 30 50 cm soil layer presents a relatively low salinity zone especially at the slope of the raised field where no root water uptake occurs the relatively low salinity area expands with the increasing height increments δh but shrinks with the steeper slopes the soil salt flocks down to the lower soil layer influencing crop root development and water uptake when the slope of the raised field is 15 the average soil salinity in the unsaturated profile is lower than that in flat land and decreases with the increasing height with the desalination ratio rising from 24 01 at 1 m height increment to 30 71 at 2 m height increment when the slope is added up to 30 or 45 the average soil salinity reaches more than 27 g l and the corresponding desalination ratio decreases to nearly 18 table 3 it means that the salt removing effect of the raised field is restricted at steeper slope conditions when there is no extra irrigation combined with irrigation the raised land could control soil salinity better fig 5 6 the trend of soil salinity varies similarly to that under no irrigation conditions increasing with the steeper slopes nevertheless the height increments show different effects on the soil salinity under various slope conditions the soil salinity decreases with the higher height under 15 and 30 slope conditions but increases under 45 slope conditions the average soil water salinity of the root zone at 15 30 and 45 slopes under fresh irrigation are 1 77 5 33 and 7 51 g l respectively those under saline irrigation conditions are 11 56 16 40 and 18 55 g l respectively table 3 compared with the irrigated flat land the average soil salinity under fresh and saline irrigation conditions reduces by 76 0 and 43 5 at 15 slope by 27 7 and 19 8 at 30 slope at the 45 slope raised field the average soil salinity of the root zone under saline irrigation reduces by only 9 3 compared with the irrigated flat land while that under fresh irrigation increases by 1 9 due to the extended root zone the salt removing effects of the raised field at 15 slope is the most obvious with the desalination ratios averaging 33 85 and 21 44 under fresh and saline irrigation conditions the average desalination ratio decreases to 16 59 and 10 82 at 30 slope to 11 10 and 7 48 at 45 slope under fresh and saline irrigation conditions with the extending depth to groundwater the desalination ratio of different raised fields shows an increasing trend under both fresh and saline irrigation conditions table 3 moreover the soil water content in different raised lands remains relatively high at the end of the growing season ranging from 32 8 to 37 1 the average soil water content slightly decreases with the steeper slope and the extended depth to the groundwater table but without significant differences data not shown the flat land condition performs the largest soil moisture of 38 4 due to the shallowest groundwater 3 2 influences of the raised field shallow trench pattern on crop transpiration intensive evaporation is one of the main drivers of salinization the evaporation is nearly 282 6 mm no matter in flat land or raised lands nevertheless transpiration varies among different raised fields under no irrigation scenario the transpiration in flat land is 150 37 mm and ranges from 180 01 to 218 12 mm in the 15 slope raised fields increasing with the higher height the transpiration in the 30 and 45 slope raised field conditions is lower than flat land ranging from 107 47 to 134 86 mm and decreasing with the higher height table 4 the transpiration increases considerably with the salt flushing effect of irrigation water infiltration under fresh and saline water irrigation conditions the increased percentage of transpiration in flat land is 168 04 and 85 03 under fresh and saline irrigation conditions furthermore crop transpiration improvement is more obvious in the raised fields under fresh and saline irrigation conditions the average transpiration in the 15 slope raised field is 403 18 and 350 69 mm when the slope of the raised field is added up to 30 or 45 the average transpiration decreases slightly to 403 06 or 402 20 mm under fresh water irrigation to 303 37 or 287 55 mm under saline water irrigation condition table 4 compared with the irrigated flat land the percentage of improved transpiration in the saline irrigated raised fields of 15 30 and 45 slopes are 26 04 9 03 and 3 35 respectively while the improvement percentage of transpiration is relatively small in fresh irrigated raised fields compared to the fresh irrigated flat land these results mean that crop root water uptake in saline land could be improved significantly by irrigation when fresh water resources are available the improvement is prominent in both flat land or raised lands when saline water is applied due to scarce fresh water the improvement of transpiration would be better combined with a gentle slope 15 or 30 raised field construction 3 3 contribution of groundwater to crop evapotranspiration in the raised field shallow trench pattern the similar water budget in different raised fields and flat land is analyzed by assigning the lower boundary as a free drainage condition assuming no groundwater influence table 5 when there is no irrigation the evaporation in flat land is 249 30 mm lowering by 11 77 compared to shallow groundwater conditions the evaporation in raised fields reduces to 251 79 255 98 mm with a reduction percentage of about 10 meanwhile the transpiration under free drainage conditions increases significantly compared to shallow saline groundwater conditions resulting from the effective rainfall leaching along with the free drainage water the average transpiration increases by 6 56 in flat land and over 60 00 in the raised fields when irrigation is applied the evaporation under both fresh and saline water irrigation conditions shows little difference between free drainage and shallow groundwater conditions compared to saline irrigation with shallow groundwater conditions the transpiration for free drainage conditions decreases by 15 95 mm in the flat land and increases by several millimeters in the raised fields on the contrary the fresh irrigated flat land and raised fields transpiration under free drainage conditions are lower than shallow groundwater conditions the reason could be the improved soil conditions with shallow groundwater facilitated by fresh irrigation which promotes an increase in root water uptake from shallow groundwater it is worth noting that the changes in soil water storage δs are all negative in the raised fields under free drainage conditions which is caused by the larger quantity of drainage water table 5 the evapotranspiration originated from the shallow groundwater etg can be determined from the differences between the evapotranspiration with shallow groundwater conditions and under free drainage conditions the etg and its separation of eg evaporation from groundwater and tg transpiration from groundwater are shown in table 6 the shallow groundwater supplies considerable evaporation through capillary rise under no irrigation scenarios the eg is 33 26 mm in flat land and ranges from 26 55 to 30 74 mm in the raised land under no irrigation conditions decreasing slightly along with the rising height the irrigation events may suppress the capillary rise thus the eg is ignorable under both fresh and saline water irrigation conditions the intensive evaporation under no irrigation condition may bring out heavy salt cumulation in the root zone inhibiting crop root water uptake and then the actual transpiration table 3 the negative values of tg in table 6 suggest that the shallow saline groundwater restricts crop transpiration rather than contributes to it when there is no irrigation the transpiration reduces by 9 87 mm in flat land by 96 33 133 11 mm at 15 slope by 77 05 103 57 mm at 30 slope and by 67 93 85 90 mm at 45 slope raised fields in the presence of shallow groundwater compared to that under free drainage conditions respectively table 4 5 the decrement in transpiration goes more serious with higher height and becomes smaller with the steeper slopes under saline irrigation conditions the magnitude of tg still be negative increases to several millimeters in raised land indicating that shallow groundwater inhibition to crop transpiration is mitigated by saline irrigation the tg in different raised lands and flat land under fresh water irrigation performs positive values ranging from 5 15 to 14 83 mm which means groundwater contribution to crop transpiration etg is the comprehensive effects of groundwater on cotton evapotranspiration table 6 under no irrigation condition 23 40 mm of etg is supplied from the groundwater in flat land while etg becomes negative in the raised field due to the dominant inhibition effect on root water uptake the inhibition effect on et from the shallow groundwater is ameliorated under both fresh and saline water irrigations especially under fresh irrigation the inhibition effect changes to be the contribution effect the inhibition on etg caused by shallow groundwater is also improved by the increasing height at the 15 slope raised land under saline irrigation conditions however the increasing height increment can not alleviate the inhibition effect on etg any more at the 30 and 45 slope raised land with saline irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 the mechanism of the raised field on salt removal the nature of saline land reclamation is to remove the soluble salt from the root zone through the infiltration and discharge of a certain amount of precipitation irrigation water it is extremely difficult to flush the salt out of the root zone with continuously saline shallow groundwater there is no way out for the drainage water across the flat land coupled with the extensively distributed saline shallow groundwater akça et al 2020 found that microtopographic condition is one of the most effective factors for salinity building up apart from soil texture and saline shallow water table it has been reported that raised field can facilitate salt removal in coastal saline areas li et al 2014b jing et al 2011 dong et al 2011 the artificial islands a specially raised field with slope have been implemented to restore degraded wetlands the island s slope is believed to play a critical role in enabling effective drainage and promoting the release of soil salt wang et al 2020 however our study reveals that the salinity in the slope of the raised field remains at a relatively low level at the end of the growing season figs 5 7 that means the leachate with high salinity after irrigation or rainfall is not discharged through the slope in this study the slope above the water table is set as an atmospheric boundary condition when the seepage face is nonactive which is more realistic considering the precipitation infiltration and soil evaporation on the slope interestingly the water flux across the slope above the water table is similar to the platform part with a mere atmospheric boundary which means no significant seepage flow out across the slope it is verified by assigning a mere seepage face at the slope the results of seepage flux still are zero furthermore the velocity vectors after pre sowing irrigation are illustrated in fig 7 which displays the flow direction in the raised field and provides another evidence for the outlet of the saline drainage thus we can conclude that the raised land s desalination is not easy to discharge salt through the slope this study s general results show that the higher raised field is beneficial for salt removal positively correlated with the drainage amount especially under fresh irrigation conditions r 0 74 p 0 05 moreover the gentler slope gradient of the raised field is also conductive to drainage due to the wider outlet in the trench the salt removal effect in raised land is based on the intensified drainage across the lower boundary this agrees well with the nature as mentioned above of saline land reclamation 4 2 the influence of shallow groundwater to crop evapotranspiration shallow groundwater could contribute to the crop evapotranspiration and yield through the capillary rise forming a groundwater subsidy zipper et al 2015 soylu et al 2014 earlier scientists have quantified the groundwater subsidy to cotton evapotranspiration by lysimeter experiments for instance namken et al 1969 found that groundwater contributed 54 26 and 17 of the total cotton evapotranspiration with the water tables at 0 91 1 83 and 2 74 m respectively hutmacher et al 1996 noted that the total cotton evapotranspiration contribution from the shallow groundwater 120 cm water depth of 20 ds m was about 30 42 and declined to 12 19 at higher salinity levels the contribution percentage of groundwater to the evapotranspiration is much strongly affected by water table depth than groundwater salinity kruse et al 1993 xue et al 2018 however groundwater contribution to cotton evapotranspiration under saline irrigation is inhibited in this study the relatively high initial soil salinity leads to the inhibition effect the average soil water salinity in the root zone is greater than cotton s salt tolerance threshold in some scenarios even the reclamation has been conducting for five years it is worth noting that the inhibition effects still exsited even at 15 slope raised fields with small height increment the cotton evapotranspiration at 15 slope raised fields averages 633 25 mm decreasing to 585 95 mm at 30 slope and to 570 10 mm at 45 slope under saline irrigation conditions the results indicate that the raised field with a gentle slope 15 and large height increment δh 1 5 or 2 m combined with saline irrigation could nearly meet the local cotton water requirement 650 7 mm under full irrigation conditions duan 2004 besides when the simulation is extended to 10 years we find that the desalination ratio in the raised fields with saline irrigation will stabilize after 5 year reclamation without obvious salt building up fig 8 note that the shallow trench around the raised field can also harvest the natural rainfall or even runoff from around sites that may be added as fresh water for irrigation which is out of this study s research scope and will be studied in the future in summary raised field shallow trench provides an alternative solution to saline land reclamation under fresh water scarcity 4 3 implications and limitations of the study this study indicates that the raised field shallow trench pattern could extend large crop cultivated area to ensure food security in the saline areas with shallow groundwater the cotton is planted only at the platform part in the raised field which results in lower land use efficiency than traditional plantation in the flat land nevertheless this study presents the production potential at the slope with relatively low soil salinity it will offset the lower land use efficiency and strengthen the slope stability by growing crop the virtual experiment by model simulation is a convenient fast and cost effective way to optimize the size parameters of the raised field design however several limitations should be considered in evaluating the saline land reclamation in addition to the model verification by field data firstly the shallow groundwater is set constant in terms of the water table and water salinity the assumption is different from the real situation because this boundary condition allows drainage water to flow out of the domain without raising the water table or changing salinity while the groundwater table and salinity will fluctuate when irrigation or rainfall occurs future research should include the fluctuation of the groundwater table and the varying salinity in the heavily saline cotton planting area sun et al 2012 has demonstrated the feasibility of changing drainage into impoundment in the raised field shallow trench pattern and identified the mechanism of salt removal by cycling water between the waterbody in a trench and the soil along with changes in water level secondly the effects of the groundwater fluctuation to crop root water uptake remains unknown which is limited to a great extent by the vague understanding and parameterization of the interaction between root and soil certainly this is also a crop type dependent hence future research should also reveal groundwater replenishment to the soil root zone and its contribution to soil evaporation and crop transpiration using more crop types and quantify the impact of different groundwater conditions on groundwater subsidies thirdly the soil texture is taken as homogeneous throughout the field profile in this study soil textural heterogeneity which caused the differences in soil water potential has been associated with salt and water transport wang et al 2017 li et al 2014a li 1965a also suggested the distribution of different soil textures would influence crop growth nevertheless it is interesting to investigate how different soil types in one research area influence the salt removal mechanism due to the construction of the raised field 5 conclusion the raised field is an effective measure for the reclamation of saline land with shallow groundwater the raised land prolongs the depth to the groundwater table and enhances the drainage at the lower boundary the gentler slope and higher height are more favorable for salt removal the 30 and 45 slope raised lands without irrigation cannot reduce the soil salinity in the unsaturated root zone any more compared with the flat land considering the current fresh water scarcity situation the raised field shallow trench combined with saline water irrigation could meet the water requirement of some salt tolerant crops such as cotton this production pattern creates great potential for water saving and food security acknowledgments the research was funded by the national
