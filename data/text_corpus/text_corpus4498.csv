effect of rudder roll stabilization on ship turning motion according to 21 the lqr controller has satisfactory course keeping and roll reduction performance in low sea conditions therefore the lqr controller is considered here to realize the rrs control during ship turning the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 establishes the mathematical models of the nonlinear 4 dof ship motion

based on the analysis results the controller design is given in section 4 section 5 is the results and discussion finally the conclusion is given 2 ship modeling as shown in fig 1 two coordinate systems the inertial coordinate system and the body fixed coordinate system are used to describe the motion of the ship the ship is usually considered as a rigid body in the modeling of ship motion according to newton law the 6 dof equations of ship motion can be obtained abkowitz 1964 these 6 dof motions are coupled with each other with different coupling strength and can be divided into several groups according to the study purpose the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of rrs on ship turning performance as for ship s turning under certain sea conditions without loss of generality it is assumed that a ship is steered to the left and is subjected to the action of the waves during the turning as shown in fig 2 it is easy to know that the ship experiences a period of head seas and following seas during the turning process where parametric rolling and strong coupling effect between heave pitch and roll can occur holden et al 2007 however 5 pointed out that the wave encounter frequency condition ω e 2 ω ϕ can be destroyed by controlling the ship speed and heading to avoid the occurrence of parametric roll it is known that the heading and sailing speed of the ship keep changing during the turning process in waves making it difficult to meet the wave encounter frequency condition 33 and 38 have shown through simulations and experiments that the parametric roll can also be reduced or even eliminated by controlling the rudder moreover the turning operation will not be carried out under high sea conditions to ensure the safety of the ship and the occurrence of parametric roll also requires the buildup of several roll cycles therefore the influence of the parametric roll can be neglected for the high speed large rudder angle turning in low sea conditions in this paper as the turning motion of the ship in horizontal plane is mainly considered in this paper therefore the pitch and heave attitudes in vertical plane can be neglected soder et al 2013 therefore the 4 dof ship model in surge sway roll and yaw is considered as 1 m u v r x g r 2 z g p r x e x h y d x p r o p x r u d m v u r x g r z g p y e y h y d y p r o p y r u d i x p m z g v u r k e k h y d k p r o p k r u d i z r m x g v u r n e n h y d n p r o p n r u d where m is the ship mass x g and z g are the coordinates of cg in x and z axes respectively i x and i z are the moment of inertia about the x and z axes respectively u v p and r are the surge velocity sway velocity roll angular velocity and yaw angular velocity respectively x y k and n with subscripts e h y d p r o p and r u d are the forces and moments induced by hydrodynamics propellers rudders and environment disturbance respectively 2 1 disturbance forces and moments compared with sea currents and winds sea waves have a greater impact on ship motion therefore the disturbance forces and moments induced by sea waves are mainly considered in this paper as the motion of sea waves is a complicated stochastic process it is difficult to model accurately to simplify the research the model proposed by 9 is adopted to simulate sea wave disturbance the disturbance forces and moments are given as 2 x

moments respectively a n b n c n d n g n and h n are the corresponding coefficients of the first order wave disturbance forces and moments c x w c y w and c n w are the corresponding coefficients of the second order wave disturbance forces and moments ω n and ω e are the wave frequency and encounter frequency respectively χ is the encounter angle l p p is the length between perpendiculars and d is the ship draft ε n λ n and a n are the random phase wave length and wave height of the n th regular wave respectively n n is the number of regular waves 2 2 hydrodynamic forces and moments the hydrodynamic forces and moments can be expressed in the form of nonlinear functions of the position velocity and acceleration of the ship and are influenced by the ship state and fluid characteristics abkowitz 1964 in this paper the following nonlinear hydrodynamic expression is adopted perez 2005 3 x h x u u x u u u u x v r v r y h y v v y p p y r r y u v u v y u r u r y v v v v y v r v r y r v r

acceleration is the displacement of the ship g z φ is the righting arm curve the multipliers are the ship s hydrodynamic coefficients 2 3 propeller forces and moments the vast majority of ships rely on one or more propellers to provide the propulsion of the ship the propeller induced lateral force and yaw moment are small and generally can be ignored fang et al 2012 the propulsive force generated on the propellers can be considered equal to the ship resistance martin 2003 29 suggested that the propulsive force can be set equal to x u u u 0 2 as a first approximation therefore the propeller forces and moments are 4 x p r o p x u u u 0 2 y p r o p 0 k p r o p 0 n p r o p 0 where x u u is the hydrodynamic coefficient related to the surge velocity and u 0 is the initial ship speed 2 4 rudder forces and moments the rudders are usually installed after the propeller below the stern line of the ship liang et al 2018 rudders are generally driven by hydraulic machinery according to the action command from the controller this machinery can impose constraints on the control action to describe the characteristics of the hydraulic machinery the mathematical model proposed by 2 as shown in fig 3 is adopted in this paper δ c δ m δ m a x and δ m a x are the control command mechanical angle maximum angle and maximum turning rate of the rudder respectively the forces generated on an angled rudder are shown in fig 4 u is the inflow velocity δ is the rudder angle of attack b is the chord a is the distance between the rudder shaft and the leading edge x c is the distance between the leading edge and the rudder s center of pressure cp f is the total hydrodynamic force l and d are the lift and drag force respectively and can be calculated as 29 5 l 0 5 ρ a u 2 c l δ d 0 5 ρ a u 2 c d 0 c l 2 δ 0 9 π λ where a is the rudder area λ is the rudder aspect ratio c l δ and c d 0 are the rudder side force coefficient and minimum section drag coefficient respectively the rudder forces and moments acting on the ship hull can be calculated as wang 2013 6 x r u d d y r u d l k r u d r r l n r u d l c g l where r r and l c g are the vertical and longitudinal distance between cp of the rudder and cg of the ship respectively 3 simulation analysis a multipurpose naval vessel with twin propellers and twin rudders is selected as the research object the main parameters of the ship and rudder are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively the hydrodynamic coefficients presented in section 2 1 can be found in 29 the rudder angle that turns the ship to port is defined as the positive rudder angle the fluid is the seawater with density of 1025 kg m 3 3 1 ship turning with static rudder angles 3 1 1 model verification before conducting the study it is necessary to verify the correctness of the established model in section 2 due to the lack of data from scaled model tests and full scale trials the accuracy of the established model is verified and confirmed by comparing the simulation results with the calculation results using the empirical formulas obtained through a large number of model tests and full scale trials 10 suggested the following formula to describe the relationship between the speed drop on turning and the steady turning radius 7 u 0 u s 3 sin π 2 u s u 0 5 9 r 0 l p p 2 1 where u s is the ship speed during steady turning period and r 0 is the steady turning radius the steady outward heel angle φ s during ship turns in calm water can be estimated using the following formula jia and yang 1999 8 φ s u s 2 v c g d 2 g h r 0 where vcg is the vertical distance between cg and the baseline of the ship and h is the transverse metacentric height without loss of generality the simulations of ship turning motion with rudder angle of 30 rudder turning rate of 10 s and initial sailing speed of 5 m s 10 m s and 15 m s in calm water are carried out and the corresponding results are shown in fig 5 and table 3 the total simulation time is 250 s the results of the first 100 s of the roll motion are given here to clearly show the transition process to preliminarily verify the correctness of the established mathematical model the simulation results are compared with the empirical formula calculation results as shown in table 4 the negative sign is used to describe the relative magnitude of the simulation and calculation values it can be seen from table 4 that the errors of the steady turning diameter between simulations and calculations are all below 4 5 the error between the simulated and calculated steady outward heel angle is relatively large however it is acceptable if we take into account the small value base of the outward heel angle and the simplification in the modeling process therefore the mathematical model established in section 2 has a certain degree of accuracy and the obtained results also have a certain degree of reference value 3 1 2 ship turning with different rudder turning rates fig 6 and table 5 show the simulation results of ship turning in calm water with different rudder rates the initial sailing speed is 15 m s and the turning rudder angle is set to 30 it should be noted that the limitation of the rudder rate is ignored here to facilitate the discussion and analysis the maximum rudder speed in the subsequent simulations was 10 s it can be seen from fig 6 and table 5 that the rudder turning rate mainly affects the initial inward heel and the advance and has no effect on other turning parameters the initial inward heel angle increases and the advance slightly decreases as the rudder turning rate increases this characteristics can be used to reduce the rolling during rudder turning process that is a lower rudder rate can be used during the steering phase to reduce the initial inward heel angle 3 1 3 ship turning under waver disturbance fig 7 presents the simulation results of ship turning motion under wave disturbance with different encounter angles the significant wave height is 2 m the initial ship speed is 15 m s the turning rudder angle is 30 and the rudder rate is 10 s nwd in the legend of fig 7 is the abbreviation for no wave disturbance it can be seen from fig 7 that the trajectory of the turning circle under wave disturbance is slightly shifted to the initial wave direction the wave disturbance also makes the heeling of the turning process unstable the outward heeling exhibits irregular fluctuations on the basis of the steady outward heel angle in calm water the heeling becomes more intense when the encounter angle is close to 90 it can be concluded that the outward heeling during ship turns under higher sea conditions will become large enough to threaten the safety of the ship therefore it should be avoided to turn the ship at large sailing speed and rudder angle in high sea conditions it is also necessary to reduce the unstable heeling caused by sea waves during the turning process 3 2 ship turning with dynamic rudder angles to investigate the effect of rudder movement on ship turning performance the simulations of ship turning with dynamic rudder angle of δ t u r n i n g δ r sin 2 π t t δ t u r n i n g δ r and t are the turning rudder angle fluctuation amplitude and period respectively are conducted it can be seen that the static rudder angle is a special case of the dynamic rudder angle with the fluctuation period t s and fluctuation amplitude δ r 0 s figs 8 and 9 are the simulation results of ship turning in calm water with rudder fluctuation amplitude of 5 and different fluctuation periods and with rudder fluctuation period of 5 5 s and different fluctuation amplitudes respectively the initial sailing speed is 15 m s the turning rudder angle is 25 and the rudder rate is 10 s it can be seen from figs 8 and 9 that the small high frequency steering has little effect on the turning circle and the rudder induced roll motion increases as the fluctuation period decreases and fluctuation amplitude increases that is to say we can use the rudder to reduce the roll motion during ship turning motion and the potential for rudder roll stabilization increases as the steering speed and amplitude increase 4 controller design it can be known from the analysis in section 3 that rudders can be used to reduce the roll motion during ship turns the diagram of rudder roll stabilization during ship turning is shown in fig 10 the principle of rudder roll stabilization control during turns is similar to that in normal straight navigation the difference is that the rudder keeps changing around the turning rudder angle and the ship rolls around the steady outward heel angle in calm water it can be seen from section 3 1 3 that sea waves mainly causes the ship to move around the steady state value in the calm water turning therefore the state of the ship in steady turning period in calm water can be considered as the modeling basis 12 suggested to separately control the course and roll motion using rudders therefore ignoring the coupling between the roll and the other three degrees of freedom motion the following equation can be obtained from eq 1 as 9 i x k p p k u p k p p ρ g g m φ k δ δ φ k e φ p where g z φ and k r u d are represented by g m φ and k δ δ φ respectively let x p φ t be the state variable and u δ φ be the input variable rewriting eq 9 into the state space representation as 10 x a x b u d the system matrix a and the input matrix b in eq 10 can be regarded as constant matrices for the ship in steady turning period in calm water in this paper the linear quadratic regulator lqr controller is adopted to realize the rudder roll stabilization control during ship turns lqr control is an optimal control strategy with the quadratic performance index and is widely applied to the active control of deterministic vibratory systems brunton and noack 2015 there is an automatic means of finding an appropriate state feedback controller that minimizes the performance index lee et al 2011 for the system described by eq 10 the control can be regarded as an infinite time state regulation problem according to 6 for an infinite time state regulator the terminal penalty is usually not considered in the performance index therefore to achieve the optimal roll reduction effect the linear quadratic performance index is selected as 11 j 1 2 0 x t q x u t r u d t where q is the semi positive definite symmetric weight matrix and r is the positive definite symmetric matrix the optimal control law that minimizes the performance index j can be calculated as 12 u r 1 b t p x k x where k is the optimal control gain and p is the symmetric positive definite solution of the following algebraic riccati equation are 13 p a a t p p b r 1 b t p q 0 where the boundary condition satisfies p t f 0 5 results and discussion in this section the simulations of ship turning under wave disturbance with rrs are performed to verify the effectiveness of the designed controller the simulation parameters are as follows the turning rudder angle is set to 30 the initial ship speed is 15 m s the significant wave height is 1 5 m the initial encounter angle is 135 the weighting matrices of the lqr controller are q d i a g 30 100 and r 1 which are obtained by trial and error according to the method presented by brian and john 1989 and our experience according to the parameters given in section 3 and 29 the system matrix a and the input matrix b can be easily obtained as 0 1636 1 2534 1 0 and 0 009 0 under the current simulation conditions according to eqs 12 and 13 the optimal control gain under the above simulation condition can be easily calculated as k l q r 2 8011 0 3586 the simulation results of ship turning with and without rrs are given in fig 11 marked as with rrs and without rrs respectively it can be seen from fig 11 that the designed lqr rrs controller can effectively reduce the roll motion during ship turns the mean square roll angles in the steady turning process without and with rrs control is 1 04 and 0 47 respectively the anti rolling effect is up to 54 5 it can also be seen that the trajectory of the turning circle with rrs has a certain offset compared to the trajectory without rrs it shows that while using the rudder to reduce the ship s roll it will inevitably have a certain impact on the turning circle that is the heading the maximum initial inward heel angle is reduced from 6 55 to 5 27 and the heel reduction effect is only 19 5 as discussed in section 3 1 2 we can use a lower rudder rate during the steering phase to reduce the initial inward heel angle based on this idea the simulation results with rudder rate of 5 s 7 5 s and 10 s at the steering phase are given in fig 12 in order to have an intuitive comparison the simulation results of the main turning circle parameters with and without rrs are given in table 6 the values before and after the slashes in fig 12 and table 6 respectively indicate the rudder speed before and after the steering is completed it can be seen from fig 12 and table 6 that the initial inward heel angle has a obvious reduction the maximum initial inward heel angles with rudder rate of 5 s and 7 5 s at the steering phase are 3 15 and 4 84 respectively and the inward heel reduction effects are 51 9 and 26 1 respectively however since the steering speed has an opposite effect on the initial inward heel and the advance the advance increases as the initial inward heel decreases the advance with rudder rate of 5 s at the steering phase is increased by about 16 m compared to that without control moreover it can be seen from fig 12 that a proper reduction in rudder speed seems to offset the effect of rrs on the turning circle nevertheless it can be concluded that the roll motion of the ship during turning can be effectively reduced using rudder with a properly designed control strategy 6 conclusion in this paper the effect of rudder roll stabilization on ship turning motion is investigated a multi purpose naval vessel is selected as the research object and the 4 dof mathematical model with forces and moments induced by hydrodynamics propellers rudders and waves is established the correctness of the established model is verified by comparing the results of simulations and empirical formula calculations based on the analysis of ship turning motion with static and dynamic rudder angle in calm water it is found that the rudder can be used to reduce the roll motion during ship turning the lqr controller is adopted to realize the rudder roll stabilization control during ship turns simulation results show that the designed rrs controller can effectively reduce the roll motion during ship turns on this basis a variable rudder rate rrs control strategy is proposed the simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can effectively reduce the roll motion during ship turns without much affecting the turning performance it can be concluded that rudders can also be used to reduce the roll motion during ship turns with a properly designed control strategy it also provides a new idea to the roll reduction control during ship turns especially

z g v u r k e k h y d k p r o p k r u d i z r m x g v u r n e n h y d n p r o p n r u d where m is the ship mass x g and z g are the coordinates of cg in x and z axes respectively i x and i z are the moment of inertia about the x and z axes respectively u v p and r are the surge velocity sway velocity roll angular velocity and yaw angular velocity respectively x y k and n with subscripts e h y d p r o p and r u d are the forces and moments induced by hydrodynamics propellers rudders and environment disturbance respectively 2 1 disturbance forces and moments compared with sea currents and winds sea waves have a greater impact on ship motion therefore the disturbance forces and moments induced by sea waves are mainly considered in this paper as the motion of sea waves is a complicated stochastic process it is difficult to model accurately to simplify the research the model proposed by 9 is adopted to simulate sea wave disturbance the disturbance forces and moments are given as 2 x

moments respectively a n b n c n d n g n and h n are the corresponding coefficients of the first order wave disturbance forces and moments c x w c y w and c n w are the corresponding coefficients of the second order wave disturbance forces and moments ω n and ω e are the wave frequency and encounter frequency respectively χ is the encounter angle l p p is the length between perpendiculars and d is the ship draft ε n λ n and a n are the random phase wave length and wave height of the n th regular wave respectively n n is the number of regular waves 2 2 hydrodynamic forces and moments the hydrodynamic forces and moments can be expressed in the form of nonlinear functions of the position velocity and acceleration of the ship and are influenced by the ship state and fluid characteristics abkowitz 1964 in this paper the following nonlinear hydrodynamic expression is adopted perez 2005 3 x h x u u x u u u u x v r v r y h y v v y p p y r r y u v u v y u r u r y v v v v y v r v r y r v r

acceleration is the displacement of the ship g z φ is the righting arm curve the multipliers are the ship s hydrodynamic coefficients 2 3 propeller forces and moments the vast majority of ships rely on one or more propellers to provide the propulsion of the ship the propeller induced lateral force and yaw moment are small and generally can be ignored fang et al 2012 the propulsive force generated on the propellers can be considered equal to the ship resistance martin 2003 29 suggested that the propulsive force can be set equal to x u u u 0 2 as a first approximation therefore the propeller forces and moments are 4 x p r o p x u u u 0 2 y p r o p 0 k p r o p 0 n p r o p 0 where x u u is the hydrodynamic coefficient related to the surge velocity and u 0 is the initial ship speed 2 4 rudder forces and moments the rudders are usually installed after the propeller below the stern line of the ship liang et al 2018 rudders are generally driven by hydraulic machinery according to the action command from the controller this machinery can impose constraints on the control action to describe the characteristics of the hydraulic machinery the mathematical model proposed by 2 as shown in fig 3 is adopted in this paper δ c δ m δ m a x and δ m a x are the control command mechanical angle maximum angle and maximum turning rate of the rudder respectively the forces generated on an angled rudder are shown in fig 4 u is the inflow velocity δ is the rudder angle of attack b is the chord a is the distance between the rudder shaft and the leading edge x c is the distance between the leading edge and the rudder s center of pressure cp f is the total hydrodynamic force l and d are the lift and drag force respectively and can be calculated as 29 5 l 0 5 ρ a u 2 c l δ d 0 5 ρ a u 2 c d 0 c l 2 δ 0 9 π λ where a is the rudder area λ is the rudder aspect ratio c l δ and c d 0 are the rudder side force coefficient and minimum section drag coefficient respectively the rudder forces and moments acting on the ship hull can be calculated as wang 2013 6 x r u d d y r u d l k r u d r r l n r u d l c g l where r r and l c g are the vertical and longitudinal distance between cp of the rudder and cg of the ship respectively 3 simulation analysis a multipurpose naval vessel with twin propellers and twin rudders is selected as the research object the main parameters of the ship and rudder are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively the hydrodynamic coefficients presented in section 2 1 can be found in 29 the rudder angle that turns the ship to port is defined as the positive rudder angle the fluid is the seawater with density of 1025 kg m 3 3 1 ship turning with static rudder angles 3 1 1 model verification before conducting the study it is necessary to verify the correctness of the established model in section 2 due to the lack of data from scaled model tests and full scale trials the accuracy of the established model is verified and confirmed by comparing the simulation results with the calculation results using the empirical formulas obtained through a large number of model tests and full scale trials 10 suggested the following formula to describe the relationship between the speed drop on turning and the steady turning radius 7 u 0 u s 3 sin π 2 u s u 0 5 9 r 0 l p p 2 1 where u s is the ship speed during steady turning period and r 0 is the steady turning radius the steady outward heel angle φ s during ship turns in calm water can be estimated using the following formula jia and yang 1999 8 φ s u s 2 v c g d 2 g h r 0 where vcg is the vertical distance between cg and the baseline of the ship and h is the transverse metacentric height without loss of generality the simulations of ship turning motion with rudder angle of 30 rudder turning rate of 10 s and initial sailing speed of 5 m s 10 m s and 15 m s in calm water are carried out and the corresponding results are shown in fig 5 and table 3 the total simulation time is 250 s the results of the first 100 s of the roll motion are given here to clearly show the transition process to preliminarily verify the correctness of the established mathematical model the simulation results are compared with the empirical formula calculation results as shown in table 4 the negative sign is used to describe the relative magnitude of the simulation and calculation values it can be seen from table 4 that the errors of the steady turning diameter between simulations and calculations are all below 4 5 the error between the simulated and calculated steady outward heel angle is relatively large however it is acceptable if we take into account the small value base of the outward heel angle and the simplification in the modeling process therefore the mathematical model established in section 2 has a certain degree of accuracy and the obtained results also have a certain degree of reference value 3 1 2 ship turning with different rudder turning rates fig 6 and table 5 show the simulation results of ship turning in calm water with different rudder rates the initial sailing speed is 15 m s and the turning rudder angle is set to 30 it should be noted that the limitation of the rudder rate is ignored here to facilitate the discussion and analysis the maximum rudder speed in the subsequent simulations was 10 s it can be seen from fig 6 and table 5 that the rudder turning rate mainly affects the initial inward heel and the advance and has no effect on other turning parameters the initial inward heel angle increases and the advance slightly decreases as the rudder turning rate increases this characteristics can be used to reduce the rolling during rudder turning process that is a lower rudder rate can be used during the steering phase to reduce the initial inward heel angle 3 1 3 ship turning under waver disturbance fig 7 presents the simulation results of ship turning motion under wave disturbance with different encounter angles the significant wave height is 2 m the initial ship speed is 15 m s the turning rudder angle is 30 and the rudder rate is 10 s nwd in the legend of fig 7 is the abbreviation for no wave disturbance it can be seen from fig 7 that the trajectory of the turning circle under wave disturbance is slightly shifted to the initial wave direction the wave disturbance also makes the heeling of the turning process unstable the outward heeling exhibits irregular fluctuations on the basis of the steady outward heel angle in calm water the heeling becomes more intense when the encounter angle is close to 90 it can be concluded that the outward heeling during ship turns under higher sea conditions will become large enough to threaten the safety of the ship therefore it should be avoided to turn the ship at large sailing speed and rudder angle in high sea conditions it is also necessary to reduce the unstable heeling caused by sea waves during the turning process 3 2 ship turning with dynamic rudder angles to investigate the effect of rudder movement on ship turning performance the simulations of ship turning with dynamic rudder angle of δ t u r n i n g δ r sin 2 π t t δ t u r n i n g δ r and t are the turning rudder angle fluctuation amplitude and period respectively are conducted it can be seen that the static rudder angle is a special case of the dynamic rudder angle with the fluctuation period t s and fluctuation amplitude δ r 0 s figs 8 and 9 are the simulation results of ship turning in calm water with rudder fluctuation amplitude of 5 and different fluctuation periods and with rudder fluctuation period of 5 5 s and different fluctuation amplitudes respectively the initial sailing speed is 15 m s the turning rudder angle is 25 and the rudder rate is 10 s it can be seen from figs 8 and 9 that the small high frequency steering has little effect on the turning circle and the rudder induced roll motion increases as the fluctuation period decreases and fluctuation amplitude increases that is to say we can use the rudder to reduce the roll motion during ship turning motion and the potential for rudder roll stabilization increases as the steering speed and amplitude increase 4 controller design it can be known from the analysis in section 3 that rudders can be used to reduce the roll motion during ship turns the diagram of rudder roll stabilization during ship turning is shown in fig 10 the principle of rudder roll stabilization control during turns is similar to that in normal straight navigation the difference is that the rudder keeps changing around the turning rudder angle and the ship rolls around the steady outward heel angle in calm water it can be seen from section 3 1 3 that sea waves mainly causes the ship to move around the steady state value in the calm water turning therefore the state of the ship in steady turning period in calm water can be considered as the modeling basis 12 suggested to separately control the course and roll motion using rudders therefore ignoring the coupling between the roll and the other three degrees of freedom motion the following equation can be obtained from eq 1 as 9 i x k p p k u p k p p ρ g g m φ k δ δ φ k e φ p where g z φ and k r u d are represented by g m φ and k δ δ φ respectively let x p φ t be the state variable and u δ φ be the input variable rewriting eq 9 into the state space representation as 10 x a x b u d the system matrix a and the input matrix b in eq 10 can be regarded as constant matrices for the ship in steady turning period in calm water in this paper the linear quadratic regulator lqr controller is adopted to realize the rudder roll stabilization control during ship turns lqr control is an optimal control strategy with the quadratic performance index and is widely applied to the active control of deterministic vibratory systems brunton and noack 2015 there is an automatic means of finding an appropriate state feedback controller that minimizes the performance index lee et al 2011 for the system described by eq 10 the control can be regarded as an infinite time state regulation problem according to 6 for an infinite time state regulator the terminal penalty is usually not considered in the performance index therefore to achieve the optimal roll reduction effect the linear quadratic performance index is selected as 11 j 1 2 0 x t q x u t r u d t where q is the semi positive definite symmetric weight matrix and r is the positive definite symmetric matrix the optimal control law that minimizes the performance index j can be calculated as 12 u r 1 b t p x k x where k is the optimal control gain and p is the symmetric positive definite solution of the following algebraic riccati equation are 13 p a a t p p b r 1 b t p q 0 where the boundary condition satisfies p t f 0 5 results and discussion in this section the simulations of ship turning under wave disturbance with rrs are performed to verify the effectiveness of the designed controller the simulation parameters are as follows the turning rudder angle is set to 30 the initial ship speed is 15 m s the significant wave height is 1 5 m the initial encounter angle is 135 the weighting matrices of the lqr controller are q d i a g 30 100 and r 1 which are obtained by trial and error according to the method presented by brian and john 1989 and our experience according to the parameters given in section 3 and 29 the system matrix a and the input matrix b can be easily obtained as 0 1636 1 2534 1 0 and 0 009 0 under the current simulation conditions according to eqs 12 and 13 the optimal control gain under the above simulation condition can be easily calculated as k l q r 2 8011 0 3586 the simulation results of ship turning with and without rrs are given in fig 11 marked as with rrs and without rrs respectively it can be seen from fig 11 that the designed lqr rrs controller can effectively reduce the roll motion during ship turns the mean square roll angles in the steady turning process without and with rrs control is 1 04 and 0 47 respectively the anti rolling effect is up to 54 5 it can also be seen that the trajectory of the turning circle with rrs has a certain offset compared to the trajectory without rrs it shows that while using the rudder to reduce the ship s roll it will inevitably have a certain impact on the turning circle that is the heading the maximum initial inward heel angle is reduced from 6 55 to 5 27 and the heel reduction effect is only 19 5 as discussed in section 3 1 2 we can use a lower rudder rate during the steering phase to reduce the initial inward heel angle based on this idea the simulation results with rudder rate of 5 s 7 5 s and 10 s at the steering phase are given in fig 12 in order to have an intuitive comparison the simulation results of the main turning circle parameters with and without rrs are given in table 6 the values before and after the slashes in fig 12 and table 6 respectively indicate the rudder speed before and after the steering is completed it can be seen from fig 12 and table 6 that the initial inward heel angle has a obvious reduction the maximum initial inward heel angles with rudder rate of 5 s and 7 5 s at the steering phase are 3 15 and 4 84 respectively and the inward heel reduction effects are 51 9 and 26 1 respectively however since the steering speed has an opposite effect on the initial inward heel and the advance the advance increases as the initial inward heel decreases the advance with rudder rate of 5 s at the steering phase is increased by about 16 m compared to that without control moreover it can be seen from fig 12 that a proper reduction in rudder speed seems to offset the effect of rrs on the turning circle nevertheless it can be concluded that the roll motion of the ship during turning can be effectively reduced using rudder with a properly designed control strategy 6 conclusion in this paper the effect of rudder roll stabilization on ship turning motion is investigated a multi purpose naval vessel is selected as the research object and the 4 dof mathematical model with forces and moments induced by hydrodynamics propellers rudders and waves is established the correctness of the established model is verified by comparing the results of simulations and empirical formula calculations based on the analysis of ship turning motion with static and dynamic rudder angle in calm water it is found that the rudder can be used to reduce the roll motion during ship turning the lqr controller is adopted to realize the rudder roll stabilization control during ship turns simulation results show that the designed rrs controller can effectively reduce the roll motion during ship turns on this basis a variable rudder rate rrs control strategy is proposed the simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can effectively reduce the roll motion during ship turns without much affecting the turning performance it can be concluded that rudders can also be used to reduce the roll motion during ship turns with a properly designed control strategy it also provides a new idea to the roll reduction control during ship turns especially for ships with rudders as the only maneuvering device acknowledgments this work is supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities china under grants heucfm170404 and harbin

shell is firstly decomposed to several narrow shell segments to be treated as conical shells by employing flügge shell theory and power series displacements and forces at any cross section of conical shells are expressed as eight unknown coefficients then expanding surface pressure and velocity as fourier series in circumferential direction the surface helmholtz integral equation is reduced to the line integral along the generator line and the pressure is further represented as displacements of all segments through meshing the generator line to some 3 node isoparametric elements and utilizing relationships of velocities and displacements last continuity conditions between adjacent segments which include modifications introduced by acoustic pressure and elastic boundary conditions are

accuracy of the semi analytic model are demonstrated meanwhile contributions of different circumferential modes and different compartments of the combined conical cylindrical spherical shell to vibro acoustic responses are investigated keywords shells of revolution vibro acoustic analysis helmholtz integral equation semi analytical method 1 introduction shells of revolution are very common structures in engineering and usually exist in the form of independent conical shells cylindrical shells spherical shells and combinations of those independent shells in many circumstances various kinds of dynamic loads act on the shells and generate serious vibrations and acoustic pressure is further radiated from the vibrating shells when the shells are coupled with fluid for most engineering structures about shells of revolution such as cooling towers water tanks and loudspeakers reducing vibrations is an efficient way to improve the performance and increase the service life of structures for some special engineering structures about shells of revolution e g submarines torpedoes aircrafts and rockets vibration and acoustic responses are vital and they must be controlled in accordance with the relative standards in consequence knowing vibro acoustic characteristics of shells of revolution is indispensable in design process however to the authors knowledge investigations about vibro acoustic problems of shells of revolution with arbitrary shapes are rare as the simplest forms of shells of revolution structural acoustic coupling problems of independent conical shells guo 1995 caresta and kessissoglou 2008 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2014 xie et al 2015 cylindrical shells stepanishen 1982 guo 1996 zhang 2002 lynch et al 2013 chen et al 2016 aslani et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and spherical shells junger 1952 hayek 1966 ding and chen 1998 choi et al 2012 lynch et al 2013 were extensively studied and only limited papers from hundreds and thousands of ones are referred above in contrast with independent shells of revolution studies about combined shells of revolution are relatively scant some researchers recently investigated vibro acoustic characteristics of combined conical cylindrical shells caresta et al 2008 caresta and kessissoglou 2010 zhang et al 2013 combined spherical cylindrical spherical shells maury and filippi 2001 peters et al 2014 2015 qu et al 2015 and combined conical cylindrical spherical shells liu et al 2010 pan et al 2011 leader et al 2013 jin et al 2018 it should be mentioned that for the cited papers about combined conical cylindrical spherical shells only jin and coworkers jin et al 2018 developed an energy based formulation conical cylindrical spherical shells on the basis of vibration governing equations of combined conical cylindrical shells ma et al 2014 and combined conical cylindrical spherical shells su and jin 2016 and the others were experiments however these studies are mainly limited to one special form of shells of revolution and they are no longer appropriate for general shells of revolution for general shells of revolution with arbitrary shapes the radius varies with axial coordinate and it is difficult or impossible to give analytic expressions of acoustic pressure acting on the shells boundary element method about helmholtz integral equation is widely adopted to solve acoustic radiation problems how to improve the efficiency solving the integral equation of shells of revolution has received widespread attention since the nineties of last century in these studies by taking full advantage of the axisymmetric property of shells of revolution researchers expanded surface pressure and velocity as fourier series with respect to the angle of revolution and reduced the surface integral to line integral along the generator line juhl 1993 soenarko 1993 grannell 1994 kuijpers et al 1997 wang et al 1997 provatidis 1998 tsinopoulos et al 1999 liu et al 2002 mohsen and ochmann 2010 ramesh et al 2012 xiang et al 2012 young et al 2012 to eliminate the non uniqueness the combined helmholtz integral equation chief developed by schenck 1968 was utilized by mohsen and ochmann 2010 whereas the composite helmholtz integral equation proposed by burton and miller 1971 was employed in the articles grannell 1994 wang et al 1997 tsinopoulos et al 1999 liu et al 2002 ramesh et al 2012 xiang et al 2012 introduced an approach the wave superposition method with complex radius vector to deal with the non uniqueness for singular integrals the problem was overcome by dividing the singular integrals about the angle of revolution into non singular and singular parts in most of the listed papers and the singular integrals were calculated via the elliptic integral and its recurrence formulas liu et al 2002 proposed the reproduction of diagonal terms rdt to avoid hyper singular integrals although the efficiency about the integral equation was improved by reducing the surface integral to line integral the fast fourier transform was utilized to more efficiently calculate the integrals about the angle of revolution in the papers kuijpers et al 1997 provatidis 1998 tsinopoulos et al 1999 xiang et al 2012 young et al 2012 in addition the integral along the generator line was calculated through a high order nyström discretization scheme young et al 2012 and the fast fourier transform xiang et al 2012 respectively unfortunately only acoustic radiation problems are discussed and structural acoustic coupling problems are not involved in due to the complexity in modeling and solving procedure about simultaneously considering both dynamic models of shells of revolution and acoustic models of external fluid opened works about theoretical approaches analytic and semi analytic approaches for vibro acoustic analysis of shells of revolution are rare chen and ginsberg 1993 combined the surface variational principle and the dynamic equations of shells to investigate acoustic radiation of shells of revolution and emphatically discussed vibro acoustic characteristics of a spheroidal shell chen and stepanishen 1994 used time dependent in vacuo eigenvector expansions to evaluate the acoustic transient radiation from fluid loaded shells of revolution which were excited by axisymmetric excitations by idealizing axisymmetric shells as two node ring finite elements and using the method of singularities to solve the boundary equation berot and peseux 1998 proposed a numerical model to study vibro acoustic behaviors of axisymmetric shells immersed in heavy fluid combining the modified variational method the multi segment technique and the spectral kirchhoff helmholtz integral formulation qu and meng 2015 2016 analyzed vibro acoustic behaviors of multilayered and functionally graded shells of revolution in light and heavy fluids the main purpose of present paper is to develop a unified semi analytic method to predict vibro acoustic responses of submerged shells of revolution which include independent shells and their combinations e g conical shells cylindrical shells spherical shells combined conical cylindrical spherical shells and so forth the shell is firstly divided into some shell segments and the segments are treated as conical shells by employing flügge shell theory and expanding displacements as power series displacements and forces at arbitrary cross section of conical shells can be expressed as 8 unknown coefficients these segments are easily assembled to the overall shell through continuity conditions and corresponding vibration governing equation is established by additionally considering boundary conditions helmholtz integral equation is adopted to describe motions of external acoustic pressure and it is reduced to the line integral along the generator line through expanding acoustic pressure and velocity as fourier series meshing the generator line into several 3 node elements and combining the surface velocities and displacements of segments vibro acoustic governing equation for structural acoustic coupling problems about shells of revolution is obtained by introducing acoustic pressure to continuity conditions between shell segments the proposed semi analytic method is believed to contain following novelties first it provides a unified approach to analyze vibro acoustic problems of general shells of revolution and both independent and combined shells of revolution are included second as compared with traditional finite element boundary element method the efficiency of present method is much higher especially for the shells with straight generator line last the method can be easily extended to analyze vibro acoustic behaviors of shells of revolution stiffened by bulkheads and rings with rectangular l and t cross sections as modeling stiffening members as combinations of annular plates with different semi vertex angles and radii 2 theory formulas a general shell of revolution with thickness h is shown in fig 1 and a global cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z is introduced to uniformly consider the shell model and external acoustic pressure the shell is divided into some shell segments according to dashed lines in the figure as segments are narrow enough segments can be treated as conical shells with different semi angles and radii and effects of external acoustic pressure are considered by adding the pressure to continuity conditions of shell segments 2 1 shell structures 2 1 1 conical shell segments fig 2 shows a conical shell and

derivations about the integrals g n and h n are not given and readers can refer to the paper wang et al 1997 as needed as the generator line is meshed into some 3 node isoparametric elements as shown in fig 3 local coordinates pressure and velocity in one element are expressed as 36 r i 1 3 n i ζ r i z i 1 3 n i ζ z i p i 1 3 n i ζ p i w i 1 3 n i ζ w i where r i z i p i and w i are parameters of

p n b n w n for nonclosed shells e g cylindrical shells without end plates the acoustic model is sealed by rigid baffles at two ends the chief method schenck 1968 is employed to eliminate the nonuniqueness since no singularity occurs for points inside the shell eq 33 about these points is easily solved by using similar procedure of eq 38 and it is 39 a n chief p n b n chief w n for field points outside the shell the procedure is the same with chief points excluding that the geometry constant c p becomes 1 from 0 combining eq 38 and eq 39 the final relationship about pressure and velocity becomes 40 a n p n b n w n where 41 a n a n a n chief b n b n b n chief eq 40 is overdetermined and it can be solved by the least square method 2 3 final vibro acoustic governing equation acoustic pressure acting on the shell is considered through adding the pressure to continuity conditions between segments as analyzing structural acoustic coupling problems to uniformly analyze the shell and acoustic pressure the discretization of generator line in acoustic pressure analysis is taken into account as dividing the shell to segments which means that axial locations of the shell segments and nodes are the same accordingly there are p 2 elements to be considered as the shell divided into p segments by virtue of the euler s formula eq 40 is appropriate for the two cases that surface pressure and velocity are expanded as fourier series represented in the trigonometric form and the exponential form considering the form of displacements in eq 3 eq 40 is transformed to 42 a n

mentioned that two rows in κ f n i c and κ f n i s are nonzero vectors which is attributed to that the sound pressure is perpendicular to the vibrating surface and it is decomposed into radial and axial parts in accordance with the global cylindrical coordinate introducing the extended matrices to the vibration governing equation 19 the final vibro acoustic governing equation of submerged shells of revolution is 50 κ h c 0 0 κ h s κ f c 0 0 κ f s x c x s f e c f e s where matrices κ f c and κ f s denote external acoustic pressure acting on the shell and they are 51 κ f c diag k f 0 c k

3 results and discussion in this part vibration and acoustic results of some typical shells of revolution are studied free vibrations of three independent shells including submerged cylindrical conical and spherical shells are firstly discussed to test convergence and validity of the proposed method then vibro acoustic responses of combined spherical cylindrical spherical and conical cylindrical spherical shells are compared with ones in appropriate references or calculated by fem bem to analyze accuracy of present method for complex shells and influences of parameters on vibro acoustic characteristics of combined conical spherical spherical shells are further discussed 3 1 free vibrations of independent shells free vibrations of three independent shells submerged in water are discussed for the independent shells sound speed and mass density of external water are 1500 m s and 1000 kg m 3 3 1 1 cylindrical shells a clamped cylindrical shell studied by zhang 2002 is firstly employed to test the convergence and validity of present method the length thickness and radius of the cylindrical shell are 20 m 0 01 m and 1 m respectively material parameters of the shell are young s modulus 2 1 10 11 n m 2 poisson s ratio 0 3 and density 7850 kg m 3 natural frequencies of the first eight modes are tabulated in table 1 to discuss the convergence of present method the cylindrical shell is uniformly divided into 60 80 and 100 segments from the table it is clearly found that natural frequencies of present method rapidly converge as the number of segments increases results of present method with 100 segments are in excellent agreement with the ones in literature in addition it can be concluded that present method is of higher accuracy after comparing frequencies of present method with the ones of two methods in the reference as the artificial spring technology is employed to uniformly analyze elastic and classic boundary conditions assigning appropriate stiffness constants is important effects of stiffness constants on frequencies of the first two modes are shown in fig 4 for each curve in the figure only one stiffness constant at the left edge increases from 10 to 10 16 and the other 7 ones are assigned as 10 16 it is found that frequencies dramatically increase as the stiffness constant k u increases whereas frequencies corresponding to other constants almost keep unchanged furthermore frequencies are not increased or decreased when the constants are too large or too small which means that free fixed and elastic boundary conditions can be dealt through adopting appropriate constants 3 1 2 conical shells the second independent shell of revolution is a conical shell which was studied by caresta and kessissoglou 2008 the radii of two ends of the conical shell are 0 5 m and 3 25 m the length in meridional direction and thickness of shell are 8 90 m and 0 014 m young s modulus poisson s ratio and density are 2 1 10 11 n m 2 0 3 and 78 0 0 kg m 3 in table 2 convergence and comparison of frequencies of the conical shell with different classic boundary conditions are listed in the table the number of segments adopted to discuss convergence of present method is p 40 60 and 80 for 3 kinds of boundaries the convergence of present method is rapid more importantly differences between results of present method and the literature are negligible except for a few modes 3 1 3 spherical shells free vibrations of a complete spherical shell with radius 2 5 m and thickness 0 01 m are discussed in this subsection material parameters are young s modulus 2 1 10 11 n m 2 poisson s ratio 0 3 and density 7850 kg m 3 differing from divisions of previous two shells a new parameter δ φ is introduced as shown in fig 5 and the axial length of different segments may be different on one hand to maintain the accuracy of present method segments around two poles should be narrow enough while segments at other parts may be longer on the other hand the efficiency of present method will be dramatically reduced as the length of all segments is consistent consequently different δ φ is adopted for different regions to guarantee both accuracy and efficiency δ φ 2 is adopted at the interval φ 1 φ 2 whereas δ φ 1 is adopted at the intervals 0 φ 1 and φ 2 180 to test the convergence of present method three different cases defined as cas1 cas2 and cas3 are analyzed for three cases φ 1 and φ 2 are uniform and they are 3 and 177 δ φ 1 and δ φ 2 are different in different cases and they are 1 and 3 for cas1 0 5 and 1 5 for cas2 and 0 2 and 1 for cas3 correspondingly the total number of segments is 64 128 and 204 for three cases natural frequencies of a complete spherical shell submerged in water are tabulated in table 3 it is found that the convergence of present method is rapid although discrepancies between cas2 and cas3 still exist they are smaller than the ones between cas1 and cas2 in the following analysis the division of cas3 will be adopted as spherical shells involved in what s more the discrepancy of frequencies of present method and the reference berot and peseux 1998 is negligible which demonstrates the high accuracy of present method 3 2 vibro acoustic responses of combined shells vibro acoustic responses of two combined shells combined spherical cylindrical spherical and combined conical cylindrical spherical shells will be studied hereafter 3 2 1 combined spherical cylindrical spherical shells vibro acoustic responses of the combined spherical cylindrical spherical shell studied by peters et al 2014 and qu et al 2015 are discussed in current sub section the radius and length of middle cylindrical shell is 3 25 m and 45 m the thickness of cylindrical shell and two hemispherical shells is equal and it is 0 04 m the combined shell is made of steel with young s modulus e 2 1 10 11 n m 2 poisson s ratio υ 0 3 and density ρ 7860 kg m 3 to consider structure damping η s 0 01 young s modulus e is replaced by a complex one e e 1 j η s axial ring force transverse ring force and axial point force are forced at the intersection between left hemispherical shell and cylindrical shell respectively the schematic diagram of three kinds of excitations is shown in fig 6 for ring and point excitations the magnitude is 1n the frequency range is 1 100 hz and frequency step is 0 5 hz the combined spherical cylindrical spherical shell is submerged in heavy or light acoustic medium respectively hemispherical and cylindrical shells are divided into 102 and 90 segments and the total number of segments is 294 the density and sound speed of heavy acoustic medium water are 1000 kg m 3 and 1482 m s and the ones of light acoustic medium air are 1 204 kg m 3 and 340 m s the sound power lever 10 log 10 p s 10 12 is adopted to discuss the validity of present method and p s denotes the amplitude of radiated sound power fig 7 presents radiated sound power of the combined spherical cylindrical spherical shell subjected to axial and transverse ring forces as the external fluid is air only breathing modes n 0 are excited by axial ring force whereas only beam modes bending modes n 1 are considered for transverse ring force for two forces curves of three methods are almost overlapped and some slight discrepancies appear at resonant peaks as it is known amplitudes of resonant peaks are mainly controlled by structure damping and the difference between natural and exciting frequencies on one hand different methods lead to small discrepancies of natural frequencies on the other hand structure damping is not considered by peters et al 2014 these reasons lead to negligible discrepancies of amplitudes of resonant peaks as the combined spherical cylindrical spherical shell is submerged in water the radiated sound power of the combined shell subjected to transverse ring force and axial point force is shown in fig 8 for transverse ring force the curve of present method highly coincides with the one of the reference peters et al 2014 for axial point force the truncated circumferential mode number of present method is 10 which satisfies the requirement of convergence at low frequencies three curves are consistent at high frequencies although apparent differences occur at some peaks especially two peaks of the reference in 90 100 hz the tendency of three curves is similar the reasons are similar with the ones of light acoustic medium in addition the heavy acoustic medium decreases natural frequencies of the combined shell and more modes appear in the same frequency range 1 100 hz since some modes may not be excited by using different methods the discrepancy of three curves will occur at some frequencies on the whole results of present method agree well with the reference and fem bem and it is concluded that present method can predict accurate vibro acoustic responses of combined spherical cylindrical spherical shells 3 2 2 combined conical cylindrical spherical shells vibro acoustic responses of a combined conical cylindrical spherical shell which was studied by jin et al 2018 are discussed the radius and length of cylindrical shell are 0 6 m and 4 5 m for the conical shell radii at two ends are 0 2 m and 0 6 m and the semi vertex angle is 15 the thickness of conical cylindrical and hemispherical shells is 0 008 m material parameters are young s modulus e 2 1 10 11 n m 2 poisson s ratio υ 0 3 and density ρ 78 0 0 kg m 3 to consider structure damping complex young s modulus e e 1 j η s is introduced and η s is 0 01 sound speed and mass density of external fluid are 1500 m s and 1000 kg m 3 the left end of conical shell is clamped the start and end frequencies are 1 hz and 100 hz and the frequency step is 0 5 hz the global coordinate of driving point r θ z is 0 6 0 3 7428 and it is defined as pointa excepting the driving point responses of pointb which is located at the junction of cylindrical and spherical shells are also discussed the coordinate of pointb is 0 6 0 5 9928 radiated sound pressure of one near field point feilda and one far field point feildb is considered and the global coordinates of two filed points are 1 0 3 7428 and 100 0 3 7428 for present method the conical cylindrical and spherical shells are divided into 30 90 and 102 segments respectively and the truncated circumferential mode number is 10 since results in the reference are incomplete fem bem is additionally employed to discuss the validity of present method the finite element model is developed in ansys16 0 through shell181 elements the conical cylindrical and spherical shells are meshed to 160 elements in circumferential direction in axial direction the conical and cylindrical shells are divided into 60 and 240 elements the total number of elements is 52800 the boundary element model is developed in virtual lab 13 6 and the total number of elements is 6912 to ensure the reliability of results of fem bem the first 800 modes of the finite element model are calculated and the maximum frequency is larger than 1000 hz displacement and sound pressure responses are expressed as 20 log 10 d 0 10 12 and 20 log 10 p a 10 6 in the following analysis and d 0 and p a denote amplitudes of displacement and sound pressure fig 9 compares radial displacements and radiated sound pressure of different methods for the radial displacement of driving point pointa results in the reference are also shown it is found that the curve of fem bem agrees well with the one of jin et al 2018 in 1 70 hz and some small discrepancies occur in 70 100 hz the discrepancies mainly result from differences of natural frequencies of two methods correspondingly it can be concluded that results of fem bem are reliable comparing displacements and sound pressure of present method and fem bem it is clearly observed that results of present method are in excellent agreement with the ones of fem bem excluding some shifts of resonant peaks at high frequencies in fig 10 surface displacements of the combined shell are shown for some resonant peaks which are labeled in fig 9 b although frequencies of resonant peaks are different surface displacements of two methods are almost identical to further discuss the validity of present method directivity patterns about radiated sound pressure of some frequencies are plotted in fig 11 field points of the directivity pattern are located at the plane of mid cross section of cylindrical shell and the distance between the field points and the axis of the combined shell is 1 m four sub figures correspond to the first four resonant peaks in fig 9 c in the figure curves of present method agree well with the ones of fem bem and the discrepancy results from small differences of amplitudes of resonant peaks as shown in fig 9 c besides the directivity pattern of four sub figures almost corresponds to the circumferential mode number 1 2 3 and 4 respectively to further discuss the phenomenon contributions of different circumferential modes to the radiated sound pressure are shown in fig 12 for fielda the first four circumferential mode numbers 1 2 3 and 4 are mainly contributed to the first four resonant peaks for sound pressure of far field point fieldb contributions of n 1 are dominant and other modes are negligible which illustrates the reason why the resonant peaks of fieldb are obviously less furthermore it can be deduced that beam modes n 1 may be more efficient to generate far field radiated sound pressure fig 13 compares radiated sound pressure of the combined conical cylindrical spherical shell subjected to radial and axial forces although sound pressure radiated from the combined shell excited by radial force is obviously greater than the one of axial force and more resonant peaks occur for radial excitation far field sound pressure radiated from the combined shell excited by axial force is closely equal to the one of radial force at some frequencies such as the resonant peak around 60 hz as a result far field sound pressure generated by axial force should be taken into account fig 14 and fig 15 compare sound pressure contributed by different compartments as the combined conical cylindrical spherical shell subjected to radial and axial forces respectively for both forces contributions of the cylindrical shell are dominant whereas the ones of the conical shell are insignificant on the other hand contributions of the spherical shell are non ignorable especially for the far field sound pressure as the combined shell subjected to axial force at high frequencies additionally amplitudes of cylindrical and spherical shells are larger than the total ones at some frequencies which is attributed to the phase difference of different compartments of the combined shell to more visually illustrate contributions of different compartments surface sound pressure of the combined shell is shown in fig 16 at 4 5 hz and 54 5 hz no matter what the excitation is surface sound pressure of the overall shell is similar and the one of the spherical shell is obvious at 78 5 hz surface sound pressure of the combined shell under two excitations is apparently different the surface sound pressure of spherical shell is obvious as the combined shell excited by axial force whereas the surface sound pressure of spherical shell is negligible for radial force which further states that the spherical shell significantly contributes to radiated sound pressure of the combined conical cylindrical spherical shell 4 conclusions a semi analytic method is developed to predict vibro acoustic responses of arbitrary shells of revolution for the shell it is firstly divided to some narrow shell segments in axial direction and all segments are treated as conical shells by utilizing flügge shell theory and expanding displacements as power series four displacements and four forces at any cross section of conical shells are expressed in terms of 8 unknown coefficients for acoustic pressure of external fluid the surface helmholtz integral equation is reduced to the line integral along the generator line through expanding pressure and velocity as fourier series after meshing the generator line into several 3 node isoparametric elements and considering relationships between displacements and velocities the acoustic pressure can be expressed as unknown coefficients of displacements of all segments to obtain the structure acoustic coupling system continuity conditions between adjacent segments which include modifications introduced by acoustic pressure and elastic boundary conditions are established and they can readily be assembled to the finial vibro acoustic governing equation of submerged shells of revolution to test the accuracy and convergence of present method natural frequencies of submerged cylindrical conical and spherical shells and vibro acoustic responses of combined spherical cylindrical spherical and conical cylindrical spherical shells are listed and sufficiently compared with the ones in appropriate references or calculated by fem bem which demonstrates rapid convergence and high accuracy of the semi analytic model for combined conical cylindrical spherical shells beam modes are more efficient to generate far field radiated sound pressure in addition the spherical shell significantly contributes to far field sound pressure as the combined shell subjected to axial forces as compared with theoretical models in references present model is of wider application for vibro acoustic analysis of shells of revolution with arbitrary shapes and both independent and combined shells of revolution are included in contrast to traditional finite element boundary element method the efficiency of present method is much higher and it will be more obvious for shells with straight generator line although ring stiffeners and bulkheads are not considered the model can be easily extended to include those stiffening members only if modeling bulkheads and rings with rectangular l and t cross sections as combinations of annular plates with different semi vertex angles and radii

acoustic responses are investigated keywords shells of revolution vibro acoustic analysis helmholtz integral equation semi analytical method 1 introduction shells of revolution are very common structures in engineering and usually exist in the form of independent conical shells cylindrical shells spherical shells and combinations of those independent shells in many circumstances various kinds of dynamic loads act on the shells and generate serious vibrations and acoustic pressure is further radiated from the vibrating shells when the shells are coupled with fluid for most engineering structures about shells of revolution such as cooling towers water tanks and loudspeakers reducing vibrations is an efficient way to improve the performance and increase the service life of structures for some special engineering structures about shells of revolution e g submarines torpedoes aircrafts and rockets vibration and acoustic responses are vital and they must be controlled in accordance with the relative standards in consequence knowing vibro acoustic characteristics of shells of revolution is indispensable in design process however to the authors knowledge investigations about vibro acoustic problems of shells of revolution with arbitrary shapes are rare as the simplest forms of shells of revolution structural acoustic coupling problems of independent conical shells guo 1995 caresta and kessissoglou 2008 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2014 xie et al 2015 cylindrical shells stepanishen 1982 guo 1996 zhang 2002 lynch et al 2013 chen et al 2016 aslani et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and spherical shells junger 1952 hayek 1966 ding and chen 1998 choi et al 2012 lynch et al 2013 were extensively studied and only limited papers from hundreds and thousands of ones are referred above in contrast with independent shells of revolution studies about combined shells of revolution are relatively scant some researchers recently investigated vibro acoustic characteristics of combined conical cylindrical shells caresta et al 2008 caresta and kessissoglou 2010 zhang et al 2013 combined spherical cylindrical spherical shells maury and filippi 2001 peters et al 2014 2015 qu et al 2015 and combined conical cylindrical spherical shells liu et al 2010 pan et al 2011 leader et al 2013 jin et al 2018 it should be mentioned that for the cited papers about combined conical cylindrical spherical shells only jin and coworkers jin et al 2018 developed an energy based formulation conical cylindrical spherical shells on the basis of vibration governing equations of combined conical cylindrical shells ma et al 2014 and combined conical cylindrical spherical shells su and jin 2016 and the others were experiments however these studies are mainly limited to one special form of shells of revolution and they are no longer appropriate for general shells of revolution for general shells of revolution with arbitrary shapes the radius varies with axial coordinate and it is difficult or impossible to give analytic expressions of acoustic pressure acting on the shells boundary element method about helmholtz integral equation is widely adopted to solve acoustic radiation problems how to improve the efficiency solving the integral equation of shells of revolution has received widespread attention since the nineties of last century in these studies by taking full advantage of the axisymmetric property of shells of revolution researchers expanded surface pressure and velocity as fourier series with respect to the angle of revolution and reduced the surface integral to line integral along the generator line juhl 1993 soenarko 1993 grannell 1994 kuijpers et al 1997 wang et al 1997 provatidis 1998 tsinopoulos et al 1999 liu et al 2002 mohsen and ochmann 2010 ramesh et al 2012 xiang et al 2012 young et al 2012 to eliminate the non uniqueness the combined helmholtz integral equation chief developed by schenck 1968 was utilized by mohsen and ochmann 2010 whereas the composite helmholtz integral equation proposed by burton and miller 1971 was employed in the articles grannell 1994 wang et al 1997 tsinopoulos et al 1999 liu et al 2002 ramesh et al 2012 xiang et al 2012 introduced an approach the wave superposition method with complex radius vector to deal with the non uniqueness for singular integrals the problem was overcome by dividing the singular integrals about the angle of revolution into non singular and singular parts in most of the listed papers and the singular integrals were calculated via the elliptic integral and its recurrence formulas liu et al 2002 proposed the reproduction of diagonal terms rdt to avoid hyper singular integrals although the efficiency about the integral equation was improved by reducing the surface integral to line integral the fast fourier transform was utilized to more efficiently calculate the integrals about the angle of revolution in the papers kuijpers et al 1997 provatidis 1998 tsinopoulos et al 1999 xiang et al 2012 young et al 2012 in addition the integral along the generator line was calculated through a high order nyström discretization scheme young et al 2012 and the fast fourier transform xiang et al 2012 respectively unfortunately only acoustic radiation problems are discussed and structural acoustic coupling problems are not involved in due to the complexity in modeling and solving procedure about simultaneously considering both dynamic models of shells of revolution and acoustic models of external fluid opened works about theoretical approaches analytic and semi analytic approaches for vibro acoustic analysis of shells of revolution are rare chen and ginsberg 1993 combined the surface variational principle and the dynamic equations of shells to investigate acoustic radiation of shells of revolution and emphatically discussed vibro acoustic characteristics of a spheroidal shell chen and stepanishen 1994 used time dependent in vacuo eigenvector expansions to evaluate the acoustic transient radiation from fluid loaded shells of revolution which were excited by axisymmetric excitations by idealizing axisymmetric shells as two node ring finite elements and using the method of singularities to solve the boundary equation berot and peseux 1998 proposed a numerical model to study vibro acoustic behaviors of axisymmetric shells immersed in heavy fluid combining the modified variational method the multi segment technique and the spectral kirchhoff helmholtz integral formulation qu and meng 2015 2016 analyzed vibro acoustic behaviors of multilayered and functionally graded shells of revolution in light and heavy fluids the main purpose of present paper is to develop a unified semi analytic method to predict vibro acoustic responses of submerged shells of revolution which include independent shells and their combinations e g conical shells cylindrical shells spherical shells combined conical cylindrical spherical shells and so forth the shell is firstly divided into some shell segments and the segments are treated as conical shells by employing flügge shell theory and expanding displacements as power series displacements and forces at arbitrary cross section of conical shells can be expressed as 8 unknown coefficients these segments are easily assembled to the overall shell through continuity conditions and corresponding vibration governing equation is established by additionally considering boundary conditions helmholtz integral equation is adopted to describe motions of external acoustic pressure and it is reduced to the line integral along the generator line through expanding acoustic pressure and velocity as fourier series meshing the generator line into several 3 node elements and combining the surface velocities and displacements of segments vibro acoustic governing equation for structural acoustic coupling problems about shells of revolution is obtained by introducing acoustic pressure to continuity conditions between shell segments the proposed semi analytic method is believed to contain following novelties first it provides a unified approach to analyze vibro acoustic problems of general shells of revolution and both independent and combined shells of revolution are included second as compared with traditional finite element boundary element method the efficiency of present method is much higher especially for the shells with straight generator line last the method can be easily extended to analyze vibro acoustic behaviors of shells of revolution stiffened by bulkheads and rings with rectangular l and t cross sections as modeling stiffening members as combinations of annular plates with different semi vertex angles and radii 2 theory formulas a general shell of revolution with thickness h is shown in fig 1 and a global cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z is introduced to uniformly consider the shell model and external acoustic pressure the shell is divided into some shell segments according to dashed lines in the figure as segments are narrow enough segments can be treated as conical shells with different semi angles and radii and effects of external acoustic pressure are considered by adding the pressure to continuity conditions of shell segments 2 1 shell structures 2 1 1 conical shell segments fig 2 shows a conical shell and

derivations about the integrals g n and h n are not given and readers can refer to the paper wang et al 1997 as needed as the generator line is meshed into some 3 node isoparametric elements as shown in fig 3 local coordinates pressure and velocity in one element are expressed as 36 r i 1 3 n i ζ r i z i 1 3 n i ζ z i p i 1 3 n i ζ p i w i 1 3 n i ζ w i where r i z i p i and w i are parameters of

p n b n w n for nonclosed shells e g cylindrical shells without end plates the acoustic model is sealed by rigid baffles at two ends the chief method schenck 1968 is employed to eliminate the nonuniqueness since no singularity occurs for points inside the shell eq 33 about these points is easily solved by using similar procedure of eq 38 and it is 39 a n chief p n b n chief w n for field points outside the shell the procedure is the same with chief points excluding that the geometry constant c p becomes 1 from 0 combining eq 38 and eq 39 the final relationship about pressure and velocity becomes 40 a n p n b n w n where 41 a n a n a n chief b n b n b n chief eq 40 is overdetermined and it can be solved by the least square method 2 3 final vibro acoustic governing equation acoustic pressure acting on the shell is considered through adding the pressure to continuity conditions between segments as analyzing structural acoustic coupling problems to uniformly analyze the shell and acoustic pressure the discretization of generator line in acoustic pressure analysis is taken into account as dividing the shell to segments which means that axial locations of the shell segments and nodes are the same accordingly there are p 2 elements to be considered as the shell divided into p segments by virtue of the euler s formula eq 40 is appropriate for the two cases that surface pressure and velocity are expanded as fourier series represented in the trigonometric form and the exponential form considering the form of displacements in eq 3 eq 40 is transformed to 42 a n p n c b n w n c a n p n s b n w n s where node velocity vectors of symmetric and antisymmetric modes w n c and w n s are 43 w n c t n c w x n 1 c x n 2 c x n p c t w n s t n s w x n 1 s x n 2 s x n p

and 22 p n c and p n s are further extended to matrices k f n c and k f n s and the expressions are 48 κ f n c κ f n 1 c 0 κ f n 2 c 0 κ f n 3 c 0 κ f n p c κ f n p 1 c 8 p 8 p κ f n s κ f n 1 s 0 κ f

mentioned that two rows in κ f n i c and κ f n i s are nonzero vectors which is attributed to that the sound pressure is perpendicular to the vibrating surface and it is decomposed into radial and axial parts in accordance with the global cylindrical coordinate introducing the extended matrices to the vibration governing equation 19 the final vibro acoustic governing equation of submerged shells of revolution is 50 κ h c 0 0 κ h s κ f c 0 0 κ f s x c x s f e c f e s where matrices κ f c and κ f s denote external acoustic pressure acting on the shell and they are 51 κ f c diag k f 0 c k

3 results and discussion in this part vibration and acoustic results of some typical shells of revolution are studied free vibrations of three independent shells including submerged cylindrical conical and spherical shells are firstly discussed to test convergence and validity of the proposed method then vibro acoustic responses of combined spherical cylindrical spherical and conical cylindrical spherical shells are compared with ones in appropriate references or calculated by fem bem to analyze accuracy of present method for complex shells and influences of parameters on vibro acoustic characteristics of combined conical spherical spherical shells are further discussed 3 1 free vibrations of independent shells free vibrations of three independent shells submerged in water are discussed for the independent shells sound speed and mass density of external water are 1500 m s and 1000 kg m 3 3 1 1 cylindrical shells a clamped cylindrical shell studied by zhang 2002 is firstly employed to test the convergence and validity of present method the length thickness and radius of the cylindrical shell are 20 m 0 01 m and 1 m respectively material parameters of the shell are young s modulus 2 1 10 11 n m 2 poisson s ratio 0 3 and density 7850 kg m 3 natural frequencies of the first eight modes are tabulated in table 1 to discuss the convergence of present method the cylindrical shell is uniformly divided into 60 80 and 100 segments from the table it is clearly found that natural frequencies of present method rapidly converge as the number of segments increases results of present method with 100 segments are in excellent agreement with the ones in literature in addition it can be concluded that present method is of higher accuracy after comparing frequencies of present method with the ones of two methods in the reference as the artificial spring technology is employed to uniformly analyze elastic and classic boundary conditions assigning appropriate stiffness constants is important effects of stiffness constants on frequencies of the first two modes are shown in fig 4 for each curve in the figure only one stiffness constant at the left edge increases from 10 to 10 16 and the other 7 ones are assigned as 10 16 it is found that frequencies dramatically increase as the stiffness constant k u increases whereas frequencies corresponding to other constants almost keep unchanged furthermore frequencies are not increased or decreased when the constants are too large or too small which means that free fixed and elastic boundary conditions can be dealt through adopting appropriate constants 3 1 2 conical shells the second independent shell of revolution is a conical shell which was studied by caresta and kessissoglou 2008 the radii of two ends of the conical shell are 0 5 m and 3 25 m the length in meridional direction and thickness of shell are 8 90 m and 0 014 m young s modulus poisson s ratio and density are 2 1 10 11 n m 2 0 3 and 78 0 0 kg m 3 in table 2 convergence and comparison of frequencies of the conical shell with different classic boundary conditions are listed in the table the number of segments adopted to discuss convergence of present method is p 40 60 and 80 for 3 kinds of boundaries the convergence of present method is rapid more importantly differences between results of present method and the literature are negligible except for a few modes 3 1 3 spherical shells free vibrations of a complete spherical shell with radius 2 5 m and thickness 0 01 m are discussed in this subsection material parameters are young s modulus 2 1 10 11 n m 2 poisson s ratio 0 3 and density 7850 kg m 3 differing from divisions of previous two shells a new parameter δ φ is introduced as shown in fig 5 and the axial length of different segments may be different on one hand to maintain the accuracy of present method segments around two poles should be narrow enough while segments at other parts may be longer on the other hand the efficiency of present method will be dramatically reduced as the length of all segments is consistent consequently different δ φ is adopted for different regions to guarantee both accuracy and efficiency δ φ 2 is adopted at the interval φ 1 φ 2 whereas δ φ 1 is adopted at the intervals 0 φ 1 and φ 2 180 to test the convergence of present method three different cases defined as cas1 cas2 and cas3 are analyzed for three cases φ 1 and φ 2 are uniform and they are 3 and 177 δ φ 1 and δ φ 2 are different in different cases and they are 1 and 3 for cas1 0 5 and 1 5 for cas2 and 0 2 and 1 for cas3 correspondingly the total number of segments is 64 128 and 204 for three cases natural frequencies of a complete spherical shell submerged in water are tabulated in table 3 it is found that the convergence of present method is rapid although discrepancies between cas2 and cas3 still exist they are smaller than the ones between cas1 and cas2 in the following analysis the division of cas3 will be adopted as spherical shells involved in what s more the discrepancy of frequencies of present method and the reference berot and peseux 1998 is negligible which demonstrates the high accuracy of present method 3 2 vibro acoustic responses of combined shells vibro acoustic responses of two combined shells combined spherical cylindrical spherical and combined conical cylindrical spherical shells will be studied hereafter 3 2 1 combined spherical cylindrical spherical shells vibro acoustic responses of the combined spherical cylindrical spherical shell studied by peters et al 2014 and qu et al 2015 are discussed in current sub section the radius and length of middle cylindrical shell is 3 25 m and 45 m the thickness of cylindrical shell and two hemispherical shells is equal and it is 0 04 m the combined shell is made of steel with young s modulus e 2 1 10 11 n m 2 poisson s ratio υ 0 3 and density ρ 7860 kg m 3 to consider structure damping η s 0 01 young s modulus e is replaced by a complex one e e 1 j η s axial ring force transverse ring force and axial point force are forced at the intersection between left hemispherical shell and cylindrical shell respectively the schematic diagram of three kinds of excitations is shown in fig 6 for ring and point excitations the magnitude is 1n the frequency range is 1 100 hz and frequency step is 0 5 hz the combined spherical cylindrical spherical shell is submerged in heavy or light acoustic medium respectively hemispherical and cylindrical shells are divided into 102 and 90 segments and the total number of segments is 294 the density and sound speed of heavy acoustic medium water are 1000 kg m 3 and 1482 m s and the ones of light acoustic medium air are 1 204 kg m 3 and 340 m s the sound power lever 10 log 10 p s 10 12 is adopted to discuss the validity of present method and p s denotes the amplitude of radiated sound power fig 7 presents radiated sound power of the combined spherical cylindrical spherical shell subjected to axial and transverse ring forces as the external fluid is air only breathing modes n 0 are excited by axial ring force whereas only beam modes bending modes n 1 are considered for transverse ring force for two forces curves of three methods are almost overlapped and some slight discrepancies appear at resonant peaks as it is known amplitudes of resonant peaks are mainly controlled by structure damping and the difference between natural and exciting frequencies on one hand different methods lead to small discrepancies of natural frequencies on the other hand structure damping is not considered by peters et al 2014 these reasons lead to negligible discrepancies of amplitudes of resonant peaks as the combined spherical cylindrical spherical shell is submerged in water the radiated sound power of the combined shell subjected to transverse ring force and axial point force is shown in fig 8 for transverse ring force the curve of present method highly coincides with the one of the reference peters et al 2014 for axial point force the truncated circumferential mode number of present method is 10 which satisfies the requirement of convergence at low frequencies three curves are consistent at high frequencies although apparent differences occur at some peaks especially two peaks of the reference in 90 100 hz the tendency of three curves is similar the reasons are similar with the ones of light acoustic medium in addition the heavy acoustic medium decreases natural frequencies of the combined shell and more modes appear in the same frequency range 1 100 hz since some modes may not be excited by using different methods the discrepancy of three curves will occur at some frequencies on the whole results of present method agree well with the reference and fem bem and it is concluded that present method can predict accurate vibro acoustic responses of combined spherical cylindrical spherical shells 3 2 2 combined conical cylindrical spherical shells vibro acoustic responses of a combined conical cylindrical spherical shell which was studied by jin et al 2018 are discussed the radius and length of cylindrical shell are 0 6 m and 4 5 m for the conical shell radii at two ends are 0 2 m and 0 6 m and the semi vertex angle is 15 the thickness of conical cylindrical and hemispherical shells is 0 008 m material parameters are young s modulus e 2 1 10 11 n m 2 poisson s ratio υ 0 3 and density ρ 78 0 0 kg m 3 to consider structure damping complex young s modulus e e 1 j η s is introduced and η s is 0 01 sound speed and mass density of external fluid are 1500 m s and 1000 kg m 3 the left end of conical shell is clamped the start and end frequencies are 1 hz and 100 hz and the frequency step is 0 5 hz the global coordinate of driving point r θ z is 0 6 0 3 7428 and it is defined as pointa excepting the driving point responses of pointb which is located at the junction of cylindrical and spherical shells are also discussed the coordinate of pointb is 0 6 0 5 9928 radiated sound pressure of one near field point feilda and one far field point feildb is considered and the global coordinates of two filed points are 1 0 3 7428 and 100 0 3 7428 for present method the conical cylindrical and spherical shells are divided into 30 90 and 102 segments respectively and the truncated circumferential mode number is 10 since results in the reference are incomplete fem bem is additionally employed to discuss the validity of present method the finite element model is developed in ansys16 0 through shell181 elements the conical cylindrical and spherical shells are meshed to 160 elements in circumferential direction in axial direction the conical and cylindrical shells are divided into 60 and 240 elements the total number of elements is 52800 the boundary element model is developed in virtual lab 13 6 and the total number of elements is 6912 to ensure the reliability of results of fem bem the first 800 modes of the finite element model are calculated and the maximum frequency is larger than 1000 hz displacement and sound pressure responses are expressed as 20 log 10 d 0 10 12 and 20 log 10 p a 10 6 in the following analysis and d 0 and p a denote amplitudes of displacement and sound pressure fig 9 compares radial displacements and radiated sound pressure of different methods for the radial displacement of driving point pointa results in the reference are also shown it is found that the curve of fem bem agrees well with the one of jin et al 2018 in 1 70 hz and some small discrepancies occur in 70 100 hz the discrepancies mainly result from differences of natural frequencies of two methods correspondingly it can be concluded that results of fem bem are reliable comparing displacements and sound pressure of present method and fem bem it is clearly observed that results of present method are in excellent agreement with the ones of fem bem excluding some shifts of resonant peaks at high frequencies in fig 10 surface displacements of the combined shell are shown for some resonant peaks which are labeled in fig 9 b although frequencies of resonant peaks are different surface displacements of two methods are almost identical to further discuss the validity of present method directivity patterns about radiated sound pressure of some frequencies are plotted in fig 11 field points of the directivity pattern are located at the plane of mid cross section of cylindrical shell and the distance between the field points and the axis of the combined shell is 1 m four sub figures correspond to the first four resonant peaks in fig 9 c in the figure curves of present method agree well with the ones of fem bem and the discrepancy results from small differences of amplitudes of resonant peaks as shown in fig 9 c besides the directivity pattern of four sub figures almost corresponds to the circumferential mode number 1 2 3 and 4 respectively to further discuss the phenomenon contributions of different circumferential modes to the radiated sound pressure are shown in fig 12 for fielda the first four circumferential mode numbers 1 2 3 and 4 are mainly contributed to the first four resonant peaks for sound pressure of far field point fieldb contributions of n 1 are dominant and other modes are negligible which illustrates the reason why the resonant peaks of fieldb are obviously less furthermore it can be deduced that beam modes n 1 may be more efficient to generate far field radiated sound pressure fig 13 compares radiated sound pressure of the combined conical cylindrical spherical shell subjected to radial and axial forces although sound pressure radiated from the combined shell excited by radial force is obviously greater than the one of axial force and more resonant peaks occur for radial excitation far field sound pressure radiated from the combined shell excited by axial force is closely equal to the one of radial force at some frequencies such as the resonant peak around 60 hz as a result far field sound pressure generated by axial force should be taken into account fig 14 and fig 15 compare sound pressure contributed by different compartments as the combined conical cylindrical spherical shell subjected to radial and axial forces respectively for both forces contributions of the cylindrical shell are dominant whereas the ones of the conical shell are insignificant on the other hand contributions of the spherical shell are non ignorable especially for the far field sound pressure as the combined shell subjected to axial force at high frequencies additionally amplitudes of cylindrical and spherical shells are larger than the total ones at some frequencies which is attributed to the phase difference of different compartments of the combined shell to more visually illustrate contributions of different compartments surface sound pressure of the combined shell is shown in fig 16 at 4 5 hz and 54 5 hz no matter what the excitation is surface sound pressure of the overall shell is similar and the one of the spherical shell is obvious at 78 5 hz surface sound pressure of the combined shell under two excitations is apparently different the surface sound pressure of spherical shell is obvious as the combined shell excited by axial force whereas the surface sound pressure of spherical shell is negligible for radial force which further states that the spherical shell significantly contributes to radiated sound pressure of the combined conical cylindrical spherical shell 4 conclusions a semi analytic method is developed to predict vibro acoustic responses of arbitrary shells of revolution for the shell it is firstly divided to some narrow shell segments in axial direction and all segments are treated as conical shells by utilizing flügge shell theory and expanding displacements as power series four displacements and four forces at any cross section of conical shells are expressed in terms of 8 unknown coefficients for acoustic pressure of external fluid the surface helmholtz integral equation is reduced to the line integral along the generator line through expanding pressure and velocity as fourier series after meshing the generator line into several 3 node isoparametric elements and considering relationships between displacements and velocities the acoustic pressure can be expressed as unknown coefficients of displacements of all segments to obtain the structure acoustic coupling system continuity conditions between adjacent segments which include modifications introduced by acoustic pressure and elastic boundary conditions are established and they can readily be assembled to the finial vibro acoustic governing equation of submerged shells of revolution to test the accuracy and convergence of present method natural frequencies of submerged cylindrical conical and spherical shells and vibro acoustic responses of combined spherical cylindrical spherical and conical cylindrical spherical shells are listed and sufficiently compared with the ones in appropriate references or calculated by fem bem which demonstrates rapid convergence and high accuracy of the semi analytic model for combined conical cylindrical spherical shells beam modes are more efficient to generate far field radiated sound pressure in addition the spherical shell significantly contributes to far field sound pressure as the combined shell subjected to axial forces as compared with theoretical models in references present model is of wider application for vibro acoustic analysis of shells of revolution with arbitrary shapes and both independent and combined shells of revolution are included in contrast to traditional finite element boundary element method the efficiency of present method is much higher and it will be more obvious for shells with straight generator line although ring stiffeners and bulkheads are not considered the model can be easily extended to include those stiffening members only if modeling bulkheads and rings with rectangular l and t cross sections as combinations of annular plates with different semi vertex angles and radii

22492,the localized corrosion behaviour of an x65 subsea pipeline weldment in co2 saturated formation water was studied using weldment coupon and a novelly designed weldment multi electrode array wmea the dynamic progression of localized corrosion on different welding areas i e base metal bm heat affected zone haz and welding metal wm was probed by wmea the influences of the solution temperature and the steel microstructure on the localized corrosion of subsea pipeline weldment were analysed the test results show that haz and wm would act as anodes registering a high corrosion rate which was controlled by both micro cell corrosion and macro cell corrosion below 50 c while if the temperature increased higher than 50 c wm would transfer from major anode to significant cathode due to the preferential deposition of feco3 crystal on wm part areas of haz would act as the main anodic sites and maintain a high local anodic dissolution rate due to the macro cell current which is induced by the inhomogeneous feco3 film covering keywords subsea pipeline weldment wmea micro cell corrosion macro cell corrosion feco3 film 1 introduction the injection of carbon dioxide into the offshore oil and gas fields is an effective method for the exploitation of subsea energy resources which is defined as co2 enhanced oil recovery co2 eor technique li et al 2015 azzolina et al 2015 the application of co2 eor method can significantly improve the profitability of the offshore energy industry due to the increase of the pressure and permeability of the oil and the decrease of the viscosity and surface tension li et al 2015 on the other hand co2 eor technique has a positive contribution to the geological storage of carbon which can mitigate the global warming handford et al 2014 eldevik et al 2009 a typical offshore oil and gas production system wang and melchers 2017 including a co2 injection system oil and gas wells and subsea pipelines is plotted in fig 1 along with the injection of co2 into the oil reservoir the oil and gas can be pumped into the production wells and thereafter the oil and gas are further transported to the offshore platform through the long distance subsea pipelines although the injection of co2 is beneficial for oil and gas production and environmental protection it may bring new challenges for the offshore energy industry the mix of the liquid water and the high pressure co2 gas in the injection system could immediately lead to the pitting initiation on the internal pipe wall as for the oil producer and transportation system the perforation of the subsea pipelines is very common due to the dissolution of corrosive co2 in the formation water and seawater kermani et al 2003 dugstad et al 2006 schmitt et al 2006 xia et al 2019a high strength carbon steels such as api x65 x70 and x80 are widely used to build the subsea pipelines nazari et al 2010 pessu et al 2015 it is reported in various studies that when co2 corrosion happens in subsea pipelines the anodic reaction is the dissolution of the pipeline steel kermani et al 2003 nesic et al 2007 1 fe fe 2 2 e while the dominant cathodic reaction is the reduction of hco3 2 2 hco 3 2 e 2 co 3 2 h 2 the ferrous carbonate feco3 corrosion product layer would form on the steel surface when the concentration of fe2 and co3 2 exceeds the solubility product of feco3 3 fe 2 co 3 2 feco 3 s it is investigated in previous researches that the fluid temperature plays an important role on co2 corrosion nazari et al 2010 tanupabrungsun et al 2013 the increase of the fluid temperature in the subsea pipeline can enhance the active dissolution of the steel kermani et al 2003 however when the temperature increases to a critical value a dense and compact feco3 layer can form on the pipeline internal surface which could physically block the diffusion of the corrosive agent barker et al 2018 liang et al 2015 resulting in the inhibition of corrosion besides the influence of the fluid temperature the microstructure and elemental composition of the pipeline steel also have a significant impact on the film formation in the subsea pipelines sk et al 2018 sk et al 2017 wang et al 2019a b xia et al 2019b sun et al 2012 huang et al 1994 deen et al 2010 hassan and co workers sk et al 2018 sk et al 2017 found that the addition of chromium could help to form chromium oxide enriched passive layers moreover the appearance of 0 15 0 25 wt concentration of mo in the steel can facilitate the formation of a better adhered and more protective corrosion product layer it is normally believed that preferential dissolution of ferrite induced by the micro cell current between the ferrite and cementite could facilitate the formation of a dense feco3 scale sun et al 2012 while coarsening of widmanstatten ferrite would delay the nucleation and precipitation of feco3 crystal huang et al 1994 meanwhile the appearance of acicular ferrite sometimes would lead to the formation of a non uniform corrosion product layer which might cause the initiation of localized corrosion deen et al 2010 it is known that a long distance subsea pipeline is composed by various short pipe sections and welding is one of the most common methods to connect the short pipe sections especially for the elbow joints davis et al 2006 qiao et al 2016 2017 it is reported that a long distance subsea pipeline would have a weldment every 12 m davis et al 2006 suggesting there would be at least 8000 weldments in a 100 km long subsea oil and gas transportation pipeline therefore the safety of the pipeline weldments would directly relate to the pipeline integrity management however as the metallurgical microstructure of the weldment can be dramatically influenced by the welding materials and welding operations the corrosion behaviour of the weldment might be more sensitive to localized corrosion in comparison with the other pipe segments lu et al 2016a lu et al 2016b due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the material composition and local microstructure the non uniform co2 corrosion of different welding areas i e base metal bm area heat affected zone haz and welding metal wm area were found in various cases davis et al 2006 qiao et al 2016 2017 barker et al 2013 moreover with the precipitation of protective feco3 crystal on the steel surface at a certain temperature the heterogeneous distribution of the feco3 film on the weldment could lead to significant galvanic macro cell currents flowing through the three welding areas which might aggravate the localized corrosion at anodic sites since the fluid temperature in the subsea pipeline could vary from seawater temperature to over 120 c the corrosion behaviour of the pipeline weldment is hard to be predicted under different pipeline working temperatures once the fluid temperature in the subsea pipeline has an intense fluctuation the propagation of the weldment corrosion would suffer a dynamic progression with anodic sites and cathodic sites continually changing on the steel surface zhu et al 2016 adegbite et al 2016 han 2009 huang et al 2014 the dynamic change of the localized corrosion of the pipeline weldment is hard to be probed by traditional corrosion monitoring techniques such as linear polarization resistance lpr electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and electrical resistance er methods which only can reflect the general corrosion performance xia et al 2019c lu et al 2016a b huang et al 2016 while it is reported in recent studies that local electrochemical methods such as scanning electrochemical microscopy and electrochemically integrated multi electrode arrays possess a high spatial and temporal resolution for probing the dynamic progression of the pipeline localized corrosion xia et al 2019d wang et al 2019b xu and tan 2019 in this work a special designed multi electrode sensor array which consisted of bm haz and wm was fabricated to visualize the dynamic progression of localized corrosion on the pipe weldment under different co2 corrosion conditions the influences of the local steel microstructure on the feco3 film formation were firstly analysed using image processing technique thereafter the corrosion propagation of x65 pipeline steel weldment under 30 c and 60 c and the dynamic corrosion process of the weldment with solution temperature gradually increased from 30 c to 60 c were studied using the novel designed sensor system 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication of the weldment coupon and the weldment multi electrode array the fabrication process of a complete weldment coupon and a novelly designed weldment multi electrode array wmea are presented in fig 2 the coupon and the electrodes used for the construction of wmea were directly machined from a real subsea pipeline weldment as shown in fig 2a the original pipe sections for welding were made of api x65 pipeline steel the processing of the welding groove between the two pipe sections was conducted according to api 1104 standard api 1104 2013 2013 and aws e7010 welding filler was used for shielded metal arc welding the welding voltage and the welding current were 25 v and 100 a respectively the welding speed was controlled as 150 mm min the compositions of x65 pipeline teel and the welding filler are listed in table 1 the dimensions of the steel coupon containing the whole pipeline weldment were 80 10 10 mm3 the weldment coupon was sealed by epoxy with the upper surface kept bare and the detailed lengths of bm haz and wm are plotted in fig 2b the fabrication process of the wmea which was composed of 100 individual electrodes is shown in fig 2c the electrodes were cut from the different areas of the pipeline weldment using wire cutting method and the dimensions of each electrode were machined as 3 3 10 mm3 after the cutting procedure the 100 electrodes were fixed in a special designed sample holder which was constructed by three dimension printing technology thereafter epoxy was used to seal the gaps between the sample holder and the electrodes leading the 100 electrodes to be insulated from each other as shown in fig 2c the sample holder had 20 rows row 1 row 20 and 5 columns column 1 column 5 the electrodes located at row 10 and row 11 corresponded to wm the electrodes located at row 9 and row 12 represented haz and the electrodes distributed at the rest rows represented bm the terminals of the electrodes could be electrically connected through copper wires which were soldered at the back side of the 100 electrodes allowing the wmea to mimic a real pipeline weldment the upper surfaces of the weldment coupon and the wmea were gradually grounded from 400 to 1200 grit silicon carbide paper before the corrosion test 2 2 the analysis of the microstructure among different welding areas three specimens which were cut from bm haz and wm were used for microstructural observation respectively the specimens were hot mounted by epoxy and then gradually grounded from 400 to 1200 grit silicon carbide paper then the specimens were fine polished with the diamond paste and etched in 2 nital for 15 s after the preparation the metallographic structures of the different areas of the weldment were observed using a keyence vhx metallographic microscope the x65 pipeline steel is basically composed of pearlite and ferrite it is well known that pearlite has obvious metallographic differences from ferrite sun et al 2012 in order to further analyze the metallographic distribution of different grains of bm haz and wm an image recognition program based on binary image method was developed the binary image was a digital image that had only two possible values for each pixel typically the two colours used for a binary image were black and white in this work the binary image method was used to distinguish pearlite black pixels from ferrite white pixels through the metallographic features after image binarization the contents of the different grains on the three welding areas could be obtained by the calculation of the pixels of the two kinds of grains 2 3 corrosion tests of the weldment under different conditions the corrosion of the weldment coupon and the wmea under different temperatures were conducted in the test cell shown in fig 3 a during the test the temperature of the solution could be adjusted from 20 c to 90 c using a water bath the simulated formation water for normal subsea oil and gas fields was prepared as the test solution which main ion components are listed in table 2 the test solution was deoxygenated by bubbling pure n2 for 12 h before the introduction of co2 the ph of the solution was adjusted to 6 6 through adding sodium bicarbonate the measurement circuit of the wmea is shown in fig 3b an electrochemical instrument cst520 was used for open circuit potentials ocps and galvanic currents scanning of the wmea the ocp of each electrode was mapped to help understand the propagation of the localized corrosion on the subsea pipe weldment the ocp of the selected electrode was measured through connecting the electrode to an inserted ag agcl reference electrode re using a voltage follower the corrosion processes of the weldment were monitored by mapping galvanic currents across the wmea to further understand the initiation and propagation of localized corrosion on the weldment galvanic currents flowing between one electrode the selected individual electrode terminal which was defined as we1 and the rest short circuited array system all other 99 terminals defined as we2 were measured by a zero resistance ammeter zra the switching circuit was controlled by a multiplexer and the switching interval of each potential or current measurement was 1 s it is known that the corrosion behaviour of the pipeline under co2 corrosion would be significantly influenced by the temperature variations nazari et al 2010 in order to study the corrosion behaviour of the weldment under different temperatures two series of tests were carried out i e the tests using the weldment coupon and the tests using the wmea the weldment coupon was used to observe the overall corrosion performance of the pipeline weldment and the wmea test was adopted to visualize the dynamic progression of localized corrosion on the weldment during the weldment coupon test two steel coupons were immersed in the solutions with the temperature fixed at 30 c and 60 c for 7 days to study the corrosion behaviour of the weldment under different fixed temperatures after 7 days of immersion the surface morphologies of the weldment coupons were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem and the phase identification of the corrosion product scales of different areas was characterized via x ray diffraction xrd the wmea was firstly tested under fixed temperatures of 30 c and 60 c respectively for 7 days which was totally the same with the immersion test using weldment coupon in addition the wmea was tested under the condition with the solution temperature dynamically increased from 30 c to 60 c to study the corrosion propagation of the weldment under a gradually changed temperature aiming to simulate a real subsea pipeline working condition having a temperature increasing step by step the temperature was adjusted every 10 c and each temperature was kept for 72 h which made the total test duration last for 12 days the dynamic variation of ocps and the galvanic current distribution were measured every 2 h after the test the surface morphology of the wmea was observed using an optical microscope 3 results 3 1 metallography observation the photo of a pipeline weldment and the metallographic of bm haz and wm are shown in fig 4 a typical microstructure of the x65 pipeline steel composed of fine grains of proeutectoid ferrite white and pearlite black was presented in fig 4b the pearlite was composed of eutectoid ferrite and cementite fec3 sun et al 2012 as shown in fig 4c although haz was still consisted of ferrite and pearlite the distribution of the two kinds of grains was heterogeneous it is seen from fig 4d that wm was composed by uniform distributed ferrite and pearlite and the grain sizes on wm and haz were smaller than those on bm using the image recognition program three regions were taken from each welding area of the weldment as shown in fig 4e fig g for content analysis the analysis results are presented in table 3 it is seen from table 3 that the concentrations of pearlite and ferrite on the selected three regions were similar on both bm and wm suggesting the microstructure of bm and wm were quite uniform however it is found that the concentrations of the pearlite and ferrite varied from 6 3 to 55 9 and 44 1 93 7 respectively as shown in fig 4f indicating an extremely inhomogeneous microstructure on haz the overall content of ferrite was the highest on bm and the overall content of pearlite was the highest on haz among the three different welding areas 3 2 the corrosion behaviour of the weldment coupon under different temperatures the surface morphologies of the weldment coupon after 7 days of immersion are presented in fig 5 and the compositions of the corrosion products on the three different welding areas measured by xrd are plotted in fig 6 it is seen from fig 5a that obvious boundary between bm and haz could be seen through the general morphology of the sample scratches still can be seen on bm suggesting only slight corrosion occurred on this area significant corrosion could be observed on haz and wm with the surface became intensely rough the corrosion product on the weldment coupon could be easily washed away by deionized water after 7 days of immersion in the 30 c solution indicating only porous corrosion product formed on the steel surface according to the xrd measurement results it is seen that fe and fe3c was captured on the steel surface which suggests the preferential dissolution of ferrite both proeutectoid ferrite and eutectoid ferrite leading to only fe3c skeletons remaining on the corroded steel surface as shown in fig 5b obvious corrosion product scale could be seen on bm and wm after 7 days of immersion in the 60 c solution according to the xrd measurement results plotted in fig 6 it is found that the corrosion product scale on bm and wm was composed by feco3 crystals however only fe and fe3c were observed on the local area of haz indicating the dense feco3 layer could not cover the whole surface of haz and some local areas of the haz would still undergo active corrosion under 60 c it is seen from fig 5b that the feco3 layer on wm was denser and thicker than that on the bm only feco3 was observed on wm from xrd measurement indicating the feco3 crystal nearly covered the whole wm area however besides feco3 fe and fe3c were also found on bm which suggests the feco3 layer on bm could not completely protect the steel from corrosion based on the test results using weldment coupon it is found that temperature had a significant influence on the corrosion behaviour of the different welding areas serious corrosion would happen on wm and haz at a lower temperature wm could be well protected at a higher temperature with the forming of a dense feco3 layer however haz would suffer serious localized corrosion under both lower and higher temperatures 3 3 the measurement results of the wmea although significant different corrosion performance could be found using weldment coupons the dynamic progression of localized corrosion of the weldment under different temperatures could not be measured limiting the understanding of the propagation of localized corrosion on the weldment therefore the wmea was used to further understand the dynamic process of the localized corrosion on the weldment through the potential and galvanic current mapping the potential and galvanic current distributions obtained from the wmea under different working conditions are shown in the fig 7 to fig 12 fig 7 presents time dependences of the variations of the potential distribution with the temperature fixed at 30 c at the beginning of the test the potential of bm around 705 mv was 20 mv higher than the potentials of haz and wm around 725 mv after 7 days of immersion the potential of bm increased to 685 mv and the potentials of haz and wm reached 710 mv during the 7 days of test the potential difference between the bm and haz wm was maintained around 20 mv the corresponding galvanic current distributions on the wmea are plotted in fig 8 it is seen that the electrodes registered a higher potential bm would act as the cathodes while the electrodes registered a lower potential haz and wm would act as the anodes in addition when the coupled potential is significantly higher than the corrosion potential of the electrode tan 2013 the corrosion rate of each electrode can be calculated through the anodic current charge which can be expressed as 4 v a i j i a i j m n f ρ a where v ai j is the corrosion rate of each electrode i is the row number and j is the column number m is the molecular weight of the iron n is the number of the transferred electrons i ai j is the anodic current of the electrode in one measurement cycle f is the faraday constant and ρ is the density of the steel a is the area of each electrode it is seen from fig 8 that the anodes were concentrated at haz and wm with the maximum anodic current keeping at 2 2 10 5 a corresponding to a corrosion rate of 2 8 mm y the cathodic current were mainly distributed at bm with the magnitude maintained around 1 0 10 5 a which was twice smaller than the maximum anodic current due to the larger cathodic area the distribution maps of potential and galvanic current measured by the wmea under 60 c are presented in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively it is seen from fig 9 that the potential differences among the electrodes were tiny at the initial test period after 2 days of immersion the corrosion potential of all the electrodes on the wmea began to increase and the potential of wm had a quicker increasing rate than those of bm and haz finally the potential of wm reached 650 mv which was nearly 40 mv higher than that of bm more details could be seen from the galvanic current distributions shown in fig 10 it is seen that after 2 days of immersion bm acted as the main anodic sites and both wm and haz became the cathodic sites wm kept as the cathodes until the end of the test however part of haz gradually transferred to main anodic sites after 5 days of immersion the highest anodic current increased to 1 85 10 5 a corresponding to a corrosion rate of 2 4 mm y on haz at the end of the test indicating a dramatic high localized corrosion rate it can be seen from the measurement results that the main anodic sites appeared on the wmea are well corresponding to the severe localized corrosion area on the weldment coupon under both 30 c and 60 c conditions indicating the wmea could be used as an effective method to mimic a complete pipeline weldment without destroy its electrochemical integrity the probed dynamic transitions of the anodic sites and cathodic sites allow visualizing the initiation and propagation of the localized corrosion which is hard to be revealed by the weldment coupon test therefore the wmea was tested under a more complex pipe working condition with the solution temperature dynamically increased from 30 c to 60 c to further understand the influence of the temperature on the localized corrosion behaviour of a pipeline weldment the monitored corrosion potential and galvanic current distribution maps are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively similar with that shown in fig 7 the corrosion potentials of haz and wm were lower than that of bm at the initial 3 days of immersion 30 c the potentials of all the electrodes had a 15 mv increase with the temperature increased to 40 c after 5 days of immersion the potentials of haz and wm were still lower than that of bm at 40 c however with the solution temperature further increased to 50 c for 3 days day 9 the corrosion potential of wm had a dramatic positive shift to 660 mv which became the highest value among the different welding areas the potential of wm became more positive which reached above 650 mv with the temperature increased to 60 c after 12 days of immersion the lowest potential was constantly located at haz after the temperature increased to 50 c the galvanic current distribution maps were well corresponding to the potential distribution maps as wm gradually transferred from main anodic site to significant cathodic site with the temperature gradually increased from 30 c to 60 c however the main anodic sites were concentrated at haz when the temperature increased above 50 c the maximum anodic current was about 3 80 10 5 a and the corresponding corrosion rate was 5 8 mm y the main cathodic areas appeared on bm at the first two days of immersion at 30 c and gradually moved to wm with the temperature increasing resulting in a tiny anodic current remained on bm at the end of the test fig 13 shows the surface morphologies of the wmea after tested under different conditions it is seen from fig 13a that general corrosion occurred on the wmea with the temperature fixed at 30 c and more serious corrosion appeared on haz and wm which was similar with the weldment coupon test as shown in fig 13b a dense protective film could be seen on wm when the solution temperature fixed at 60 c and serious localized corrosion was observed at haz which can be seen from the enlarged local electrode under the condition with the solution temperature dynamically increased from 30 c to 60 c the surfaces of haz and wm were both covered with a layer of black corrosion products after 12 days of immersion which can be seen from fig 13c the corrosion product on the surface of the local area of haz was loose and easy to be washed away while the corrosion product film on the surface of wm was dense and thicker which was hard to be eliminated after removing the porous corrosion products from the surface of haz obvious pitting corrosion could be found on some electrodes located at haz area 4 discussions it is clearly seen from the test results that wm would act as the anodes when the solution temperature was lower than 50 c wm transferred to the main cathode with the temperature increased to 60 c which is associated with the formation of a dense feco3 film on its surface it suggests wm would suffer serious corrosion under a lower temperature while it could be well protected when the temperature increased to 60 c bm would act as the cathode at 30 c and feco3 crystal also could precipitate on bm at 60 c leading to a slight general corrosion happen under both 30 c and 60 c indicating bm would not become the dangerous area in the subsea transportation pipeline however dense feco3 film could not cover the whole surface of haz under both 30 c and 60 c and some local areas of haz would always act as significant anodes which means haz would suffer serious localized corrosion and it should be carefully concerned for the subsea pipeline integrity management it is known that the solution temperature steel microstructure and element compositions would significantly influence the localized corrosion behaviour of pipeline steel sk et al 2018 sk et al 2017 wang et al 2019b xia et al 2019b sun et al 2012 huang et al 1994 deen et al 2010 bordbar et al 2013 it can be seen from table 1 that the chemical compositions of x65 carbon steel and the welding filler are almost the same therefore the elemental compositions would have little influence on the corrosion process the main factors leading to the non uniform corrosion of the pipeline weldment would be the temperature and the steel microstructure it is reported that the temperature would mainly influence the solubility product of the feco3 crystal kermani et al 2003 a higher solubility product below 50 c could only lead to the formation of a porous amorphous feco3 layer which cannot inhibit the corrosion pessu et al 2015 however when the solution temperature increased to 60 c the intense decrease of the solubility product kermani et al 2003 could facilitate the nucleation of the feco3 crystal which could act as a diffusion barrier for the corrosive agents nesic and lee 2003 nordsveen et al 2003 if the steel microstructure is composed by uniformly distributed pearlite and ferrite the film formed on the steel surface would also be uniform which could well protect the whole steel surface from corrosion sun et al 2012 however due to the significant different microstructures of bm haz and wm shown in fig 4 the corrosion propagation would become more complex involving both micro cell corrosion and macro cell corrosion rodríguez et al 1999 hansson et al 2006 fig 14 shows the dynamic progression of the corrosion on the pipeline weldment considering both micro cell current and macro cell current with the temperature gradually increased from 30 c to 60 c during the initial test period in the 30 c solution the lamellar eutectoid ferrite and proeutectoid ferrite would have a lower potential than the cementite fe3c sun et al 2012 leading to the micro cell corrosion as shown in fig 14a the preferential dissolution of ferrite has been reported in various studies sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2019 and it has been further verified by the weldment coupon test under 30 c with only fe3c skeletons remained on the highly corroded area as haz and wm had a much finer grain size the micro cell current would be enhanced due to the excessive grain boundaries leading to the generation of more fe2 at haz and wm along with the hydrolysis of the ferrous ions at haz and wm the local interfacial ph of haz and wm might be lower than bm resulting in haz and wm becoming major anodic sites as shown in fig 14b the macro cell current among haz wm and bm gradually increased to the maximum value under 40 c which was well probed by the wmea the galvanic current maps shown in fig 12 suggesting the localized corrosion behaviour of the pipeline weldment was both controlled by the micro cell corrosion and macro cell corrosion under a relative lower temperature the concentration of fe2 would be higher at wm due to the high micro cell current and macro cell current since wm had a higher corrosion rate and pearlite content than those of bm a large content of lamellar cementite would remain on wm which was induced by the micro cell corrosion it is reported that feco3 crystal is easy to anchor in the narrow gap of lamellar cementite remained in pearlite and the corrosion product film can further propagate on the pearlite sun et al 2012 liang et al 2015 consequently the higher concentration of fe2 and the higher content of lamellar cementite on wm would facilitate the formation of a dense feco3 film on wm as shown in fig 14c along with the solubility product of feco3 decreased to a lower value at 50 c feco3 crystal would firstly deposit on wm leading wm gradually transferring from major anodes to the cathodic sites although haz also possessed a higher concentration of fe2 and the overall highest content of pearlite the distribution of the pearlite and ferrite was extremely uneven which would lead to the feco3 film could not uniformly grow on haz dense feco3 film could be found on the local haz area having a high content of pearlite however the feco3 film was hard to form at the local haz area nearly having no pearlite it is seen from both figs 10 and 12 that macro cell current would generate on haz due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the feco3 film as the fe2 concentration and the pearlite content on bm was lower than those on haz and wm the delay of the film formation zhu et al 2019 would lead to part of bm become significant anodes under 50 c in this case the localized corrosion of the weldment would be mainly controlled by the macro cell corrosion when the temperature finally reached 60 c as shown in fig 14d the localized corrosion behaviour of the pipeline weldment was still controlled by the macro cell corrosion which the whole wm acted as the cathode and bm and parts of haz acted as the anodes with the enhanced precipitation of the feco3 crystal layer on bm at 60 c the macro cell current between bm and wm became tiny which would not lead to a high corrosion rate of bm however as no dense feco3 layer could form on the local haz area having a low pearlite content these local haz areas would continually act as the main anodic sites where maintained a high anodic dissolution rate resulting in the quick thinning of the pipe wall according to the test results it is seen that macro cell current is an important contributor for the localized corrosion behaviour of a subsea pipeline weldment during the transportation of oil and gas medium containing co2 under different working temperatures traditional corrosion probes are hard to on line monitor the local anodes and cathodes transitions however the macro cell current among the different welding areas could be well probed by the novel designed wmea sensor which allows visualizing the dynamic progression of the localized corrosion under different pipe working conditions the wmea could be directly fabricated from the target subsea pipeline weldment which could effectively simulate the localized corrosion behaviour of a real pipeline weldement considering the influences of the steel microstructure and the environmental factors moreover the localized corrosion rate of the different welding areas could be revealed by the measured local anodic current which could facilitate the identification of the most dangerous area of the subsea pipeline weldment 5 conclusions through the investigation of the localized corrosion of a real subsea pipeline weldment using both weldment coupon and specially designed wmea the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the solution temperature variation and the steel microstructure different would significantly influence the localized corrosion process of a subsea pipeline weldment serious localized corrosion would occur on wm and haz when the solution temperature is lower than 50 c however wm would become the main cathodic area at 60 c due to the preferential deposition of the feco3 crystal on this area which was induced by the high content of pearlite and fine grain size resulting in the anodic area moving to bm and haz haz would still suffer serious localized corrosion due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the steel microstructure 2 the corrosion propagation on the subsea pipeline weldment was controlled by both micro cell corrosion and macro cell corrosion when the solution temperature was lower than 50 c the micro cell corrosion would lead to the preferential dissolution of ferrite and leaving the fe3c skeleton remained on the steel surface the high corrosion rate of wm and haz having excessive grain boundaries would lead to macro cell corrosion due to the local acidification at wm and haz however when the solution temperature increased above 50 c the macro cell corrosion would be the main contributor for the propagation of localized corrosion due to the inhomogeneous deposition of the feco3 crystal on the pipe weldment the local area having a dense feco3 layer would become the cathodic sites which is immune from corrosion in contrast the area only having a porous feco3 layer would suffer serious localized corrosion due to the high anodic current 3 the wmea technique could successfully reconstruct the real subsea pipeline weldment and simulate the corrosion behaviour of the weldment without destroying the chemical and electrochemical integrity the dynamic progression of localized corrosion on the subsea pipeline weldment could be well visualized and the localized corrosion rate could be calculated from the local anodic current the wmea technique could be used as an effective method for the monitoring of the localized corrosion of subsea pipeline weldment and provide more detailed local information for subsea pipeline integrity management acknowledgements this research was supported by key projects in the national science technology pillar

22492,the localized corrosion behaviour of an x65 subsea pipeline weldment in co2 saturated formation water was studied using weldment coupon and a novelly designed weldment multi electrode array wmea the dynamic progression of localized corrosion on different welding areas i e base metal bm heat affected zone haz and welding metal wm was probed by wmea the influences of the solution temperature and the steel microstructure on the localized corrosion of subsea pipeline weldment were analysed the test results show that haz and wm would act as anodes registering a high corrosion rate which was controlled by both micro cell corrosion and macro cell corrosion below 50 c while if the temperature increased higher than 50 c wm would transfer from major anode to significant cathode due to the preferential deposition of feco3 crystal on wm part areas of haz would act as the main anodic sites and maintain a high local anodic dissolution rate due to the macro cell current which is induced by the inhomogeneous feco3 film covering keywords subsea pipeline weldment wmea micro cell corrosion macro cell corrosion feco3 film 1 introduction the injection of carbon dioxide into the offshore oil and gas fields is an effective method for the exploitation of subsea energy resources which is defined as co2 enhanced oil recovery co2 eor technique li et al 2015 azzolina et al 2015 the application of co2 eor method can significantly improve the profitability of the offshore energy industry due to the increase of the pressure and permeability of the oil and the decrease of the viscosity and surface tension li et al 2015 on the other hand co2 eor technique has a positive contribution to the geological storage of carbon which can mitigate the global warming handford et al 2014 eldevik et al 2009 a typical offshore oil and gas production system wang and melchers 2017 including a co2 injection system oil and gas wells and subsea pipelines is plotted in fig 1 along with the injection of co2 into the oil reservoir the oil and gas can be pumped into the production wells and thereafter the oil and gas are further transported to the offshore platform through the long distance subsea pipelines although the injection of co2 is beneficial for oil and gas production and environmental protection it may bring new challenges for the offshore energy industry the mix of the liquid water and the high pressure co2 gas in the injection system could immediately lead to the pitting initiation on the internal pipe wall as for the oil producer and transportation system the perforation of the subsea pipelines is very common due to the dissolution of corrosive co2 in the formation water and seawater kermani et al 2003 dugstad et al 2006 schmitt et al 2006 xia et al 2019a high strength carbon steels such as api x65 x70 and x80 are widely used to build the subsea pipelines nazari et al 2010 pessu et al 2015 it is reported in various studies that when co2 corrosion happens in subsea pipelines the anodic reaction is the dissolution of the pipeline steel kermani et al 2003 nesic et al 2007 1 fe fe 2 2 e while the dominant cathodic reaction is the reduction of hco3 2 2 hco 3 2 e 2 co 3 2 h 2 the ferrous carbonate feco3 corrosion product layer would form on the steel surface when the concentration of fe2 and co3 2 exceeds the solubility product of feco3 3 fe 2 co 3 2 feco 3 s it is investigated in previous researches that the fluid temperature plays an important role on co2 corrosion nazari et al 2010 tanupabrungsun et al 2013 the increase of the fluid temperature in the subsea pipeline can enhance the active dissolution of the steel kermani et al 2003 however when the temperature increases to a critical value a dense and compact feco3 layer can form on the pipeline internal surface which could physically block the diffusion of the corrosive agent barker et al 2018 liang et al 2015 resulting in the inhibition of corrosion besides the influence of the fluid temperature the microstructure and elemental composition of the pipeline steel also have a significant impact on the film formation in the subsea pipelines sk et al 2018 sk et al 2017 wang et al 2019a b xia et al 2019b sun et al 2012 huang et al 1994 deen et al 2010 hassan and co workers sk et al 2018 sk et al 2017 found that the addition of chromium could help to form chromium oxide enriched passive layers moreover the appearance of 0 15 0 25 wt concentration of mo in the steel can facilitate the formation of a better adhered and more protective corrosion product layer it is normally believed that preferential dissolution of ferrite induced by the micro cell current between the ferrite and cementite could facilitate the formation of a dense feco3 scale sun et al 2012 while coarsening of widmanstatten ferrite would delay the nucleation and precipitation of feco3 crystal huang et al 1994 meanwhile the appearance of acicular ferrite sometimes would lead to the formation of a non uniform corrosion product layer which might cause the initiation of localized corrosion deen et al 2010 it is known that a long distance subsea pipeline is composed by various short pipe sections and welding is one of the most common methods to connect the short pipe sections especially for the elbow joints davis et al 2006 qiao et al 2016 2017 it is reported that a long distance subsea pipeline would have a weldment every 12 m davis et al 2006 suggesting there would be at least 8000 weldments in a 100 km long subsea oil and gas transportation pipeline therefore the safety of the pipeline weldments would directly relate to the pipeline integrity management however as the metallurgical microstructure of the weldment can be dramatically influenced by the welding materials and welding operations the corrosion behaviour of the weldment might be more sensitive to localized corrosion in comparison with the other pipe segments lu et al 2016a lu et al 2016b due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the material composition and local microstructure the non uniform co2 corrosion of different welding areas i e base metal bm area heat affected zone haz and welding metal wm area were found in various cases davis et al 2006 qiao et al 2016 2017 barker et al 2013 moreover with the precipitation of protective feco3 crystal on the steel surface at a certain temperature the heterogeneous distribution of the feco3 film on the weldment could lead to significant galvanic macro cell currents flowing through the three welding areas which might aggravate the localized corrosion at anodic sites since the fluid temperature in the subsea pipeline could vary from seawater temperature to over 120 c the corrosion behaviour of the pipeline weldment is hard to be predicted under different pipeline working temperatures once the fluid temperature in the subsea pipeline has an intense fluctuation the propagation of the weldment corrosion would suffer a dynamic progression with anodic sites and cathodic sites continually changing on the steel surface zhu et al 2016 adegbite et al 2016 han 2009 huang et al 2014 the dynamic change of the localized corrosion of the pipeline weldment is hard to be probed by traditional corrosion monitoring techniques such as linear polarization resistance lpr electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and electrical resistance er methods which only can reflect the general corrosion performance xia et al 2019c lu et al 2016a b huang et al 2016 while it is reported in recent studies that local electrochemical methods such as scanning electrochemical microscopy and electrochemically integrated multi electrode arrays possess a high spatial and temporal resolution for probing the dynamic progression of the pipeline localized corrosion xia et al 2019d wang et al 2019b xu and tan 2019 in this work a special designed multi electrode sensor array which consisted of bm haz and wm was fabricated to visualize the dynamic progression of localized corrosion on the pipe weldment under different co2 corrosion conditions the influences of the local steel microstructure on the feco3 film formation were firstly analysed using image processing technique thereafter the corrosion propagation of x65 pipeline steel weldment under 30 c and 60 c and the dynamic corrosion process of the weldment with solution temperature gradually increased from 30 c to 60 c were studied using the novel designed sensor system 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication of the weldment coupon and the weldment multi electrode array the fabrication process of a complete weldment coupon and a novelly designed weldment multi electrode array wmea are presented in fig 2 the coupon and the electrodes used for the construction of wmea were directly machined from a real subsea pipeline weldment as shown in fig 2a the original pipe sections for welding were made of api x65 pipeline steel the processing of the welding groove between the two pipe sections was conducted according to api 1104 standard api 1104 2013 2013 and aws e7010 welding filler was used for shielded metal arc welding the welding voltage and the welding current were 25 v and 100 a respectively the welding speed was controlled as 150 mm min the compositions of x65 pipeline teel and the welding filler are listed in table 1 the dimensions of the steel coupon containing the whole pipeline weldment were 80 10 10 mm3 the weldment coupon was sealed by epoxy with the upper surface kept bare and the detailed lengths of bm haz and wm are plotted in fig 2b the fabrication process of the wmea which was composed of 100 individual electrodes is shown in fig 2c the electrodes were cut from the different areas of the pipeline weldment using wire cutting method and the dimensions of each electrode were machined as 3 3 10 mm3 after the cutting procedure the 100 electrodes were fixed in a special designed sample holder which was constructed by three dimension printing technology thereafter epoxy was used to seal the gaps between the sample holder and the electrodes leading the 100 electrodes to be insulated from each other as shown in fig 2c the sample holder had 20 rows row 1 row 20 and 5 columns column 1 column 5 the electrodes located at row 10 and row 11 corresponded to wm the electrodes located at row 9 and row 12 represented haz and the electrodes distributed at the rest rows represented bm the terminals of the electrodes could be electrically connected through copper wires which were soldered at the back side of the 100 electrodes allowing the wmea to mimic a real pipeline weldment the upper surfaces of the weldment coupon and the wmea were gradually grounded from 400 to 1200 grit silicon carbide paper before the corrosion test 2 2 the analysis of the microstructure among different welding areas three specimens which were cut from bm haz and wm were used for microstructural observation respectively the specimens were hot mounted by epoxy and then gradually grounded from 400 to 1200 grit silicon carbide paper then the specimens were fine polished with the diamond paste and etched in 2 nital for 15 s after the preparation the metallographic structures of the different areas of the weldment were observed using a keyence vhx metallographic microscope the x65 pipeline steel is basically composed of pearlite and ferrite it is well known that pearlite has obvious metallographic differences from ferrite sun et al 2012 in order to further analyze the metallographic distribution of different grains of bm haz and wm an image recognition program based on binary image method was developed the binary image was a digital image that had only two possible values for each pixel typically the two colours used for a binary image were black and white in this work the binary image method was used to distinguish pearlite black pixels from ferrite white pixels through the metallographic features after image binarization the contents of the different grains on the three welding areas could be obtained by the calculation of the pixels of the two kinds of grains 2 3 corrosion tests of the weldment under different conditions the corrosion of the weldment coupon and the wmea under different temperatures were conducted in the test cell shown in fig 3 a during the test the temperature of the solution could be adjusted from 20 c to 90 c using a water bath the simulated formation water for normal subsea oil and gas fields was prepared as the test solution which main ion components are listed in table 2 the test solution was deoxygenated by bubbling pure n2 for 12 h before the introduction of co2 the ph of the solution was adjusted to 6 6 through adding sodium bicarbonate the measurement circuit of the wmea is shown in fig 3b an electrochemical instrument cst520 was used for open circuit potentials ocps and galvanic currents scanning of the wmea the ocp of each electrode was mapped to help understand the propagation of the localized corrosion on the subsea pipe weldment the ocp of the selected electrode was measured through connecting the electrode to an inserted ag agcl reference electrode re using a voltage follower the corrosion processes of the weldment were monitored by mapping galvanic currents across the wmea to further understand the initiation and propagation of localized corrosion on the weldment galvanic currents flowing between one electrode the selected individual electrode terminal which was defined as we1 and the rest short circuited array system all other 99 terminals defined as we2 were measured by a zero resistance ammeter zra the switching circuit was controlled by a multiplexer and the switching interval of each potential or current measurement was 1 s it is known that the corrosion behaviour of the pipeline under co2 corrosion would be significantly influenced by the temperature variations nazari et al 2010 in order to study the corrosion behaviour of the weldment under different temperatures two series of tests were carried out i e the tests using the weldment coupon and the tests using the wmea the weldment coupon was used to observe the overall corrosion performance of the pipeline weldment and the wmea test was adopted to visualize the dynamic progression of localized corrosion on the weldment during the weldment coupon test two steel coupons were immersed in the solutions with the temperature fixed at 30 c and 60 c for 7 days to study the corrosion behaviour of the weldment under different fixed temperatures after 7 days of immersion the surface morphologies of the weldment coupons were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem and the phase identification of the corrosion product scales of different areas was characterized via x ray diffraction xrd the wmea was firstly tested under fixed temperatures of 30 c and 60 c respectively for 7 days which was totally the same with the immersion test using weldment coupon in addition the wmea was tested under the condition with the solution temperature dynamically increased from 30 c to 60 c to study the corrosion propagation of the weldment under a gradually changed temperature aiming to simulate a real subsea pipeline working condition having a temperature increasing step by step the temperature was adjusted every 10 c and each temperature was kept for 72 h which made the total test duration last for 12 days the dynamic variation of ocps and the galvanic current distribution were measured every 2 h after the test the surface morphology of the wmea was observed using an optical microscope 3 results 3 1 metallography observation the photo of a pipeline weldment and the metallographic of bm haz and wm are shown in fig 4 a typical microstructure of the x65 pipeline steel composed of fine grains of proeutectoid ferrite white and pearlite black was presented in fig 4b the pearlite was composed of eutectoid ferrite and cementite fec3 sun et al 2012 as shown in fig 4c although haz was still consisted of ferrite and pearlite the distribution of the two kinds of grains was heterogeneous it is seen from fig 4d that wm was composed by uniform distributed ferrite and pearlite and the grain sizes on wm and haz were smaller than those on bm using the image recognition program three regions were taken from each welding area of the weldment as shown in fig 4e fig g for content analysis the analysis results are presented in table 3 it is seen from table 3 that the concentrations of pearlite and ferrite on the selected three regions were similar on both bm and wm suggesting the microstructure of bm and wm were quite uniform however it is found that the concentrations of the pearlite and ferrite varied from 6 3 to 55 9 and 44 1 93 7 respectively as shown in fig 4f indicating an extremely inhomogeneous microstructure on haz the overall content of ferrite was the highest on bm and the overall content of pearlite was the highest on haz among the three different welding areas 3 2 the corrosion behaviour of the weldment coupon under different temperatures the surface morphologies of the weldment coupon after 7 days of immersion are presented in fig 5 and the compositions of the corrosion products on the three different welding areas measured by xrd are plotted in fig 6 it is seen from fig 5a that obvious boundary between bm and haz could be seen through the general morphology of the sample scratches still can be seen on bm suggesting only slight corrosion occurred on this area significant corrosion could be observed on haz and wm with the surface became intensely rough the corrosion product on the weldment coupon could be easily washed away by deionized water after 7 days of immersion in the 30 c solution indicating only porous corrosion product formed on the steel surface according to the xrd measurement results it is seen that fe and fe3c was captured on the steel surface which suggests the preferential dissolution of ferrite both proeutectoid ferrite and eutectoid ferrite leading to only fe3c skeletons remaining on the corroded steel surface as shown in fig 5b obvious corrosion product scale could be seen on bm and wm after 7 days of immersion in the 60 c solution according to the xrd measurement results plotted in fig 6 it is found that the corrosion product scale on bm and wm was composed by feco3 crystals however only fe and fe3c were observed on the local area of haz indicating the dense feco3 layer could not cover the whole surface of haz and some local areas of the haz would still undergo active corrosion under 60 c it is seen from fig 5b that the feco3 layer on wm was denser and thicker than that on the bm only feco3 was observed on wm from xrd measurement indicating the feco3 crystal nearly covered the whole wm area however besides feco3 fe and fe3c were also found on bm which suggests the feco3 layer on bm could not completely protect the steel from corrosion based on the test results using weldment coupon it is found that temperature had a significant influence on the corrosion behaviour of the different welding areas serious corrosion would happen on wm and haz at a lower temperature wm could be well protected at a higher temperature with the forming of a dense feco3 layer however haz would suffer serious localized corrosion under both lower and higher temperatures 3 3 the measurement results of the wmea although significant different corrosion performance could be found using weldment coupons the dynamic progression of localized corrosion of the weldment under different temperatures could not be measured limiting the understanding of the propagation of localized corrosion on the weldment therefore the wmea was used to further understand the dynamic process of the localized corrosion on the weldment through the potential and galvanic current mapping the potential and galvanic current distributions obtained from the wmea under different working conditions are shown in the fig 7 to fig 12 fig 7 presents time dependences of the variations of the potential distribution with the temperature fixed at 30 c at the beginning of the test the potential of bm around 705 mv was 20 mv higher than the potentials of haz and wm around 725 mv after 7 days of immersion the potential of bm increased to 685 mv and the potentials of haz and wm reached 710 mv during the 7 days of test the potential difference between the bm and haz wm was maintained around 20 mv the corresponding galvanic current distributions on the wmea are plotted in fig 8 it is seen that the electrodes registered a higher potential bm would act as the cathodes while the electrodes registered a lower potential haz and wm would act as the anodes in addition when the coupled potential is significantly higher than the corrosion potential of the electrode tan 2013 the corrosion rate of each electrode can be calculated through the anodic current charge which can be expressed as 4 v a i j i a i j m n f ρ a where v ai j is the corrosion rate of each electrode i is the row number and j is the column number m is the molecular weight of the iron n is the number of the transferred electrons i ai j is the anodic current of the electrode in one measurement cycle f is the faraday constant and ρ is the density of the steel a is the area of each electrode it is seen from fig 8 that the anodes were concentrated at haz and wm with the maximum anodic current keeping at 2 2 10 5 a corresponding to a corrosion rate of 2 8 mm y the cathodic current were mainly distributed at bm with the magnitude maintained around 1 0 10 5 a which was twice smaller than the maximum anodic current due to the larger cathodic area the distribution maps of potential and galvanic current measured by the wmea under 60 c are presented in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively it is seen from fig 9 that the potential differences among the electrodes were tiny at the initial test period after 2 days of immersion the corrosion potential of all the electrodes on the wmea began to increase and the potential of wm had a quicker increasing rate than those of bm and haz finally the potential of wm reached 650 mv which was nearly 40 mv higher than that of bm more details could be seen from the galvanic current distributions shown in fig 10 it is seen that after 2 days of immersion bm acted as the main anodic sites and both wm and haz became the cathodic sites wm kept as the cathodes until the end of the test however part of haz gradually transferred to main anodic sites after 5 days of immersion the highest anodic current increased to 1 85 10 5 a corresponding to a corrosion rate of 2 4 mm y on haz at the end of the test indicating a dramatic high localized corrosion rate it can be seen from the measurement results that the main anodic sites appeared on the wmea are well corresponding to the severe localized corrosion area on the weldment coupon under both 30 c and 60 c conditions indicating the wmea could be used as an effective method to mimic a complete pipeline weldment without destroy its electrochemical integrity the probed dynamic transitions of the anodic sites and cathodic sites allow visualizing the initiation and propagation of the localized corrosion which is hard to be revealed by the weldment coupon test therefore the wmea was tested under a more complex pipe working condition with the solution temperature dynamically increased from 30 c to 60 c to further understand the influence of the temperature on the localized corrosion behaviour of a pipeline weldment the monitored corrosion potential and galvanic current distribution maps are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively similar with that shown in fig 7 the corrosion potentials of haz and wm were lower than that of bm at the initial 3 days of immersion 30 c the potentials of all the electrodes had a 15 mv increase with the temperature increased to 40 c after 5 days of immersion the potentials of haz and wm were still lower than that of bm at 40 c however with the solution temperature further increased to 50 c for 3 days day 9 the corrosion potential of wm had a dramatic positive shift to 660 mv which became the highest value among the different welding areas the potential of wm became more positive which reached above 650 mv with the temperature increased to 60 c after 12 days of immersion the lowest potential was constantly located at haz after the temperature increased to 50 c the galvanic current distribution maps were well corresponding to the potential distribution maps as wm gradually transferred from main anodic site to significant cathodic site with the temperature gradually increased from 30 c to 60 c however the main anodic sites were concentrated at haz when the temperature increased above 50 c the maximum anodic current was about 3 80 10 5 a and the corresponding corrosion rate was 5 8 mm y the main cathodic areas appeared on bm at the first two days of immersion at 30 c and gradually moved to wm with the temperature increasing resulting in a tiny anodic current remained on bm at the end of the test fig 13 shows the surface morphologies of the wmea after tested under different conditions it is seen from fig 13a that general corrosion occurred on the wmea with the temperature fixed at 30 c and more serious corrosion appeared on haz and wm which was similar with the weldment coupon test as shown in fig 13b a dense protective film could be seen on wm when the solution temperature fixed at 60 c and serious localized corrosion was observed at haz which can be seen from the enlarged local electrode under the condition with the solution temperature dynamically increased from 30 c to 60 c the surfaces of haz and wm were both covered with a layer of black corrosion products after 12 days of immersion which can be seen from fig 13c the corrosion product on the surface of the local area of haz was loose and easy to be washed away while the corrosion product film on the surface of wm was dense and thicker which was hard to be eliminated after removing the porous corrosion products from the surface of haz obvious pitting corrosion could be found on some electrodes located at haz area 4 discussions it is clearly seen from the test results that wm would act as the anodes when the solution temperature was lower than 50 c wm transferred to the main cathode with the temperature increased to 60 c which is associated with the formation of a dense feco3 film on its surface it suggests wm would suffer serious corrosion under a lower temperature while it could be well protected when the temperature increased to 60 c bm would act as the cathode at 30 c and feco3 crystal also could precipitate on bm at 60 c leading to a slight general corrosion happen under both 30 c and 60 c indicating bm would not become the dangerous area in the subsea transportation pipeline however dense feco3 film could not cover the whole surface of haz under both 30 c and 60 c and some local areas of haz would always act as significant anodes which means haz would suffer serious localized corrosion and it should be carefully concerned for the subsea pipeline integrity management it is known that the solution temperature steel microstructure and element compositions would significantly influence the localized corrosion behaviour of pipeline steel sk et al 2018 sk et al 2017 wang et al 2019b xia et al 2019b sun et al 2012 huang et al 1994 deen et al 2010 bordbar et al 2013 it can be seen from table 1 that the chemical compositions of x65 carbon steel and the welding filler are almost the same therefore the elemental compositions would have little influence on the corrosion process the main factors leading to the non uniform corrosion of the pipeline weldment would be the temperature and the steel microstructure it is reported that the temperature would mainly influence the solubility product of the feco3 crystal kermani et al 2003 a higher solubility product below 50 c could only lead to the formation of a porous amorphous feco3 layer which cannot inhibit the corrosion pessu et al 2015 however when the solution temperature increased to 60 c the intense decrease of the solubility product kermani et al 2003 could facilitate the nucleation of the feco3 crystal which could act as a diffusion barrier for the corrosive agents nesic and lee 2003 nordsveen et al 2003 if the steel microstructure is composed by uniformly distributed pearlite and ferrite the film formed on the steel surface would also be uniform which could well protect the whole steel surface from corrosion sun et al 2012 however due to the significant different microstructures of bm haz and wm shown in fig 4 the corrosion propagation would become more complex involving both micro cell corrosion and macro cell corrosion rodríguez et al 1999 hansson et al 2006 fig 14 shows the dynamic progression of the corrosion on the pipeline weldment considering both micro cell current and macro cell current with the temperature gradually increased from 30 c to 60 c during the initial test period in the 30 c solution the lamellar eutectoid ferrite and proeutectoid ferrite would have a lower potential than the cementite fe3c sun et al 2012 leading to the micro cell corrosion as shown in fig 14a the preferential dissolution of ferrite has been reported in various studies sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2019 and it has been further verified by the weldment coupon test under 30 c with only fe3c skeletons remained on the highly corroded area as haz and wm had a much finer grain size the micro cell current would be enhanced due to the excessive grain boundaries leading to the generation of more fe2 at haz and wm along with the hydrolysis of the ferrous ions at haz and wm the local interfacial ph of haz and wm might be lower than bm resulting in haz and wm becoming major anodic sites as shown in fig 14b the macro cell current among haz wm and bm gradually increased to the maximum value under 40 c which was well probed by the wmea the galvanic current maps shown in fig 12 suggesting the localized corrosion behaviour of the pipeline weldment was both controlled by the micro cell corrosion and macro cell corrosion under a relative lower temperature the concentration of fe2 would be higher at wm due to the high micro cell current and macro cell current since wm had a higher corrosion rate and pearlite content than those of bm a large content of lamellar cementite would remain on wm which was induced by the micro cell corrosion it is reported that feco3 crystal is easy to anchor in the narrow gap of lamellar cementite remained in pearlite and the corrosion product film can further propagate on the pearlite sun et al 2012 liang et al 2015 consequently the higher concentration of fe2 and the higher content of lamellar cementite on wm would facilitate the formation of a dense feco3 film on wm as shown in fig 14c along with the solubility product of feco3 decreased to a lower value at 50 c feco3 crystal would firstly deposit on wm leading wm gradually transferring from major anodes to the cathodic sites although haz also possessed a higher concentration of fe2 and the overall highest content of pearlite the distribution of the pearlite and ferrite was extremely uneven which would lead to the feco3 film could not uniformly grow on haz dense feco3 film could be found on the local haz area having a high content of pearlite however the feco3 film was hard to form at the local haz area nearly having no pearlite it is seen from both figs 10 and 12 that macro cell current would generate on haz due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the feco3 film as the fe2 concentration and the pearlite content on bm was lower than those on haz and wm the delay of the film formation zhu et al 2019 would lead to part of bm become significant anodes under 50 c in this case the localized corrosion of the weldment would be mainly controlled by the macro cell corrosion when the temperature finally reached 60 c as shown in fig 14d the localized corrosion behaviour of the pipeline weldment was still controlled by the macro cell corrosion which the whole wm acted as the cathode and bm and parts of haz acted as the anodes with the enhanced precipitation of the feco3 crystal layer on bm at 60 c the macro cell current between bm and wm became tiny which would not lead to a high corrosion rate of bm however as no dense feco3 layer could form on the local haz area having a low pearlite content these local haz areas would continually act as the main anodic sites where maintained a high anodic dissolution rate resulting in the quick thinning of the pipe wall according to the test results it is seen that macro cell current is an important contributor for the localized corrosion behaviour of a subsea pipeline weldment during the transportation of oil and gas medium containing co2 under different working temperatures traditional corrosion probes are hard to on line monitor the local anodes and cathodes transitions however the macro cell current among the different welding areas could be well probed by the novel designed wmea sensor which allows visualizing the dynamic progression of the localized corrosion under different pipe working conditions the wmea could be directly fabricated from the target subsea pipeline weldment which could effectively simulate the localized corrosion behaviour of a real pipeline weldement considering the influences of the steel microstructure and the environmental factors moreover the localized corrosion rate of the different welding areas could be revealed by the measured local anodic current which could facilitate the identification of the most dangerous area of the subsea pipeline weldment 5 conclusions through the investigation of the localized corrosion of a real subsea pipeline weldment using both weldment coupon and specially designed wmea the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the solution temperature variation and the steel microstructure different would significantly influence the localized corrosion process of a subsea pipeline weldment serious localized corrosion would occur on wm and haz when the solution temperature is lower than 50 c however wm would become the main cathodic area at 60 c due to the preferential deposition of the feco3 crystal on this area which was induced by the high content of pearlite and fine grain size resulting in the anodic area moving to bm and haz haz would still suffer serious localized corrosion due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the steel microstructure 2 the corrosion propagation on the subsea pipeline weldment was controlled by both micro cell corrosion and macro cell corrosion when the solution temperature was lower than 50 c the micro cell corrosion would lead to the preferential dissolution of ferrite and leaving the fe3c skeleton remained on the steel surface the high corrosion rate of wm and haz having excessive grain boundaries would lead to macro cell corrosion due to the local acidification at wm and haz however when the solution temperature increased above 50 c the macro cell corrosion would be the main contributor for the propagation of localized corrosion due to the inhomogeneous deposition of the feco3 crystal on the pipe weldment the local area having a dense feco3 layer would become the cathodic sites which is immune from corrosion in contrast the area only having a porous feco3 layer would suffer serious localized corrosion due to the high anodic current 3 the wmea technique could successfully reconstruct the real subsea pipeline weldment and simulate the corrosion behaviour of the weldment without destroying the chemical and electrochemical integrity the dynamic progression of localized corrosion on the subsea pipeline weldment could be well visualized and the localized corrosion rate could be calculated from the local anodic current the wmea technique could be used as an effective method for the monitoring of the localized corrosion of subsea pipeline weldment and provide more detailed local information for subsea pipeline integrity management acknowledgements this research was supported by key projects in the national science technology pillar

22493,artificial upwelling potentially stimulates the primary production in the ocean by bringing the nutrient rich deep ocean water dow up to the surface concepts of wave pumps have been proposed to induce upwelling flow in both regular and irregular waves however the experimental study on the performance of a novel type of wave pump in irregular waves has not yet been reported this paper presents a theoretical model and experimental data for the wave pump under irregular waves of various spectra the theoretical model took into account both the flow characteristics of the wave pump and the effect of stratification experiments were carried out on a device with 1 40 scale in wave flume and the pump capacity of the wave pump was assessed the model prediction basically agrees with the experimental findings the results show that the upwelling flow rate strongly depends on significant wave heights significant wave periods and density differences between dow and the surface water an upwelling flow of 2 480 m3 h can be induced by the wave pump under a wide range of irregular waves further study will focus on the practical application of wave pump in the open sea keywords wave pump artificial upwelling deep ocean water irregular waves 1 introduction artificial upwelling concepts of bringing up nutrient rich dow to the euphotic layer have been proposed to promote phytoplankton growth and thus to enhance primary production in the ocean over the past few decades the development of energy conversion technologies makes possible engineering applications of artificial upwelling the viable artificial upwelling systems can be classified by their energy supplies as perpetual salt fountain air lift pump and wave pump isaacs and castel 1976 liang 1996 stommel and arons 1956 stommel and arons 1956 first proposed the concept of a perpetual salt fountain in many tropical and subtropical regions continuous upwelling could be maintained as long as the differences of temperature and salinity exists utilizing the concept tsubaki et al 2004 developed an apparatus to capture the upwelling flow the flow rate with a single pipe was estimated to be 45 m 3 day tsubaki et al 2007 to produce large scale ecological effects requires employing a large number of pipes williamson et al 2009 but expenses resulting from deployment and maintenance might be very high the air lift pump proposed by liang 1996 can produce significant upwelling flow rate by injecting air into water liangpeng 2005 however there is still difficulty for the long term application of the air lift pump since relatively complicated electromechanical systems used in the air lift pump are vulnerable to occasionally severe sea conditions ocean waves are a huge largely untapped energy resource and the potential of extracting energy from waves as the power source for artificial upwelling is considerable a few different techniques for artificial upwelling by using wave energy have been studied isaacs and castel 1976 took the first step to propose a simple wave powered pump liujin 1995 developed a wave driven artificial upwelling device consisting of a buoy and a vertical long pipe with a flow controlling valve when heaving in the ambient waves the device can keep the inside water moving upward because of inertial forces bringing the dow to surface kenyon 2007 simplified the wave pump into an apparatus that contains only the pipe the open ended rigid and impermeable pipe is oriented strictly vertical and held in a fixed position so that the pipe will not oscillate with the imposed wave motion kenyon 2007 see fig 1 the upper end of the pipe is placed below the lowest troughs to ensure the device could capture the wave energy and not being exposed to the atmosphere at the same time the lower end is located at the depth where the fluid motion and pressure variations cannot be influenced by surface ocean waves according to bernoulli s principle a negative pressure would be generated when particle motion due to the wave moves across the top ending of the pipe and the pressure difference along the length of the pipe caused the fluid flow consistently upward kenyon 2007 in our previous study we performed experiments and theoretical analyses to obtain the performance of the wave pump in regular waves fan et al 2016 the results showed that the pump capacity and efficiency are functions of the product of the wave amplitude and frequency geometrical parameters of the pipe and vertical distribution of water density an upwelling flow of 5 360 m3 h can be generated by the wave pump under a wide range of wave conditions however no experiment nor data on the performance of the novel wave pump in irregular waves was found in the literature the main objective of this paper is to estimate the performance of the wave pump in irregular waves the goal is reached by i the physical model tests were performed for case study where the jonswap spectrum was applied in the experiments ii a theoretical model was developed to predict the pumped water flow rate for a given random wave and was verified by the physical model tests the relationships between the irregular waves and the upwelling flow rate was clarified based on the model prediction which might be instructive to the application of wave pump in this paper the theoretical analysis and experimental setup are presented in section 2 and 3 respectively in section 4 the theoretical model is verified and three factors affecting upwelling flow rate density difference significant wave period and significant wave height are discussed conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 irregular waves the first order irregular waves can be decomposed into infinity many linear regular waves with different amplitudes frequencies and initial phases aggarwal et al 2016 finnegan and goggins 2015 li and lin 2012 yang et al 2013 the free surface elevation can be written as 1 η t i 1 n a i cos k i x

calculated by using the iterative method 3 experimental setup 3 1 experimental setup in order to reduce both the cost and the complication of the full scale system a scaled down model was utilized to investigate the behavior of the wave pump in irregular waves the model experiments were conducted in a wave flume which is 75 m long 0 8 m wide and 1 2 m high in the hydraulic laboratory at zhejiang university china a schematic view of the experiments is shown in fig 2 the flume facility consists of a wave generator a wave absorber four wave gauges and a control center the wave generator relies on the wave height data from the wave gauges to execute negative feedback adjustment a servo driver germany s siemens pm340b and an ac servo motor are selected in the motor system of the generator and the rated power is 2 2 kw the wave absorber has the capability of efficiently absorbing reflected waves and eliminating the influence from unexpected waves control center is used to calculate the wave spectrum and control the wave generator to make irregular waves the other laboratory equipment includes an upwelling pipe an on off valve a test tank a pvc thin film bag full of the high density water which was mixed with the dye an electronic scale and a camera used to record the hydrodynamic process the diameter of the upwelling pipe is selected to be much smaller than the wave length of the surface gravity waves so as to minimize the disturbance to the wave motion by the pipe and to insure that the only forces inside the pipe is directed parallel to the pipe kenyon 2007 the test tank here is used to make sure that the pipe with an on off valve is always oriented vertically and to confirm that the velocity of the water in the tank is close to zero so that the hydrologic conditions of model is similar to the water in deep layer the upper cover of the test tank was designed to be openable and closable with a hole having a diameter slightly larger than the outer diameter of the pipe the rigid upwelling pipe inserted into the hole was fixed solidly to the cover the pvc thin film bag filled with high density water is tightly connected with the lower end of the pipe moreover the test tank is firmly fixed to the bottom of the flume so it cannot roll or vibrate even in very violent wave conditions by drilling a few small holes in the outer wall of the tank the water in the tank can be exchanged with the outside water guaranteeing the continuity of water inside and outside the tank besides the pvc thin film bag is used to continuously transfer the pressure of low density water in the tank to the high density water in the bag or the opposite the other function of the bag is to ensure that the high density water will not be polluted by the ambient water with the functions of the pvc thin film bag the pumped water flow rate then can be calculated by dividing the quantity of water that is drained out from the film bag by the experimental time fan et al 2016 a digital camera sony ilce 7rm2 a7rm2 was used to grab the image of upwelling flow the camera has a 42 4 megapixel photo resolution and exposure time is 1 8000 s each frame of image is digitized into 7952 x 5304 pixels each pixel is with a brightness of 8 bit resolution the maximum sampling rate for the image card is 5 frames per second by recording the video of the plume propagation and analyzing them frame by frame the velocities and paths could be calculated 3 2 similarity theory experimental simulation is an important approach to study the artificial upwelling and the similarity theory is an effective tool for the design of the scaled down model the basic requirements of the similarity theory include geometric similarity and dynamic similitude geometric similarity can be easily achieved by scaling all the length dimensions in the same ratio the length scale ratio d r is set as 18 d r d p d m where the subscripts p and m represent prototype and model respectively d r is also the ratio of the characteristic length of the prototype to the one of the model including the ratio of the pipe length l p l m the ratio of the water depth d p d m and the ratio of the significant wave height h 1 3 p h 1 3 m all of the characteristic lengths of the model are scaled in the same ratio so that geometric similarity makes sense to make good use of the flume the length scale ratio is set to be 40 the length of the prototype pipe proposed is 12 m so the length of the scaled model is to be 0 3 m besides the diameter of the model pipe is 45 mm proportionally converted from the 1800 mm diameter of the prototype pipe the requirement of dynamic similitude is that the froude number between prototype and model should be equal because the gravity and inertial forces are dominant and effect of remaining forces is small in the upwelling system the froude number is defined as 19 f r v g h where f r is the froude number v is the average value of the square of horizontal velocity in one period of wave at the pipe top end h is the negative pressure head generated by the wave pump to make the prototype and model similar we have 20 f r p v p g h p v m g h m f r m in the water field near the upper end of the pipe the ratio of velocity v p v m can also be the ratio of mean velocity of the water in vertical up flow u j p u j m since the similarity is established eq 20 then becomes 21 u j p u j m v p v m h p h m in wave induced artificial upwelling resistance from stratification and inertial forces are predominant whereas the remaining forces are comparatively small so the value of negative pressure head is approximately equal to the density head and the velocity head which can be written as 22 h h d h k δ ρ ρ 0 l u j 2 2 g where h d is the density head and h k is the velocity head substitute eq 22 into eq 21 eq 21 then becomes 23 u j p u j m δ ρ p ρ 0 p l p u j p 2 2 g δ ρ m ρ 0 m l m u j m 2 2 g the velocity ratio u j r can be solved as 24 u j r u j p u j m δ ρ ρ 0 r d r 1 2 from eq 24 we can find that it is not necessary to maintain the same density difference between model and prototype and the advantage of this is that we can adjust the water density differences in the experiment as we like the ratio of the flow rate q r and time t r then can be written as follows fan et al 2016 25 q r u j r d r 2 δ ρ ρ 0 r 1 2 d r 5 2 26 t r d r 1 2 δ ρ ρ 0 r 1 2 eq 25 shows that once the ratio of density difference and the ratio of length are identified the ratio of flow rate is determined the flow rate of prototype can be calculated when the flow rate of model is measured the characteristic parameter values of prototype and model are listed in table 1 3 3 experimental procedure the preparation for the experiment included the wave generator calibration and density solution configuration the wave generator calibration consisted of four main steps first the generator was turned on and started making irregular waves according to the theoretical spectrum which was calculated from the wave arguments assigned next the data of wave heights measured by the four wave gauges were sent to the control center and the fast fourier transformation fft algorithm was then used to find the actual spectrum third the computer compared the actual spectrum with the theoretical spectrum and ordered the wave generator to adjust the mapping parameters so that the two spectra were as identical as possible fourth the three steps above were repeated until we got the irregular waves we want table 2 is the comparison between target and measured parameters of irregular waves the result shows that the parameter deviation is less than 5 after the calibration the density solution configuration is to obtain solutions with different densities a salinity meter and a thermometer were used during the configuration process the international 1 atm equation of state of seawater milleropoisson 1981 was applied in the configuration the sets of experiments were conducted in irregular waves with significant wave periods ranging from 0 5 to 0 8 s corresponding to full scale significant wave periods ranging from 16 34 to 23 35 s the significant wave heights generated by the wave maker were 0 07 0 09 0 11 0 13 m equivalent to full scale waves of approximately 2 8 3 6 4 4 and 5 2 m height this study was aimed to obtain the performance of wave pump in the irregular waves full scale parameters were set and the laboratory parameters were calculated by using the similarity theory the experimental procedure is as follows 1 a little of red dye is injected into the boxes storing density solutions and the solutions is then stirred evenly 2 by using an immersible pump the dyed salt water is pumped from the boxes through a hose into the pvc thin film bag connected with the upwelling pipe 3 the pvc thin film bag filled with the high density water is weighed with an electronic scale the total weight is symbolized as m 0 4 the upwelling pipe is fixed on the test tank tightly by two straps which are thin enough to minimize their influence and the bag is placed in the tank in a stretched state in addition the air inside the bag is discharged and the on off valve is closed 5 after the water is stable the wave generator is started and the on off valve on the upwelling pipe is opened 1 min later then the water in the pvc thin film bag will be pumped into the flume because of the irregular waves 6 after a while the on off valve is closed again and the generator is stopped at the same time then the pvc thin film bag with the rest of salted water is taken out of the flume and weighed the total weight is marked as m 1 assume the time interval between the valve opened and closed is δ t the pumped water flow rate q w can be expressed as 27 q w m 0 m 1 ρ d δ t 7 repeat steps 2 6 and each experiment is repeated at least three times to minimize the occasional errors finally the pumped water flow rate q w for each given surface wave motion is obtained and draw the plots of flow rate to other parameters the tendency of the flow rate can be clarified clearly it is worth mentioning that during the whole process the water depth should be maintained at an appropriate level to guarantee that the pipe is totally submerged fig 3 shows 8 frames of an upwelling process the picture which was created by taking 1 frame every 5 frames demonstrates the ability of the wave pump to generate upwelling 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the theoretical model the experimental results at various significant wave heights and periods with four different densities are used to compare with the theoretical results to verify the validity of the proposed model in fig 3 the pumped water flow rate is plotted versus the density difference for the upwelling device used at different values of significant wave height and significant wave period these figures show that the results of the theoretical model are basically consistent with the experimental data but there are still some deviations table 3 can be used to explain the reasons for the deviations when the flow rate is small q w 99 m 3 h the flow inside the pipe is laminar flow when in the experiments in this case reynolds number governs however the flow is assumed always turbulent flow in the theoretical model where densimetric froude number governs the different flow regimes between experiments and the theoretical model lead to the errors the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the results of the theoretical model and experiments reaches a maximum of 17 8 which can be seen in fig 4 a with the flow rate increasing q w 99 m 3 h the laminar flow in the experiments transitions to turbulent flow the densimetric froude number starts to govern and the errors decrease and when the flow rate is large enough q w 173 m 3 h the nrmse reaches a minimum of 8 9 fig 4 d the average nrmse is 11 7 which is acceptable if the theoretical model is used to investigate the pump performance in the sea trails 4 2 pumped water flow rate density difference characteristics fig 4 shows the pumped water flow rate at different values of density difference fig 4 a b c d show the flow rate changing with the density difference for the same significant wave height and 4 different periods conditions from these figures the trend that the pumped water flow rate decreases with the increase of the density difference evidently appears the reason for the trend is that the pumping power obtained from the irregular waves is limited due to the given significant wave height and period but the energy consumption increases with the increase of the density difference in fig 4 d the black solid line shows that the pumped water flow rate decreases 40 m3 h when the density difference increases from 0 3 kg m3 to 0 6 kg m3 however even with the same increment when the density difference increases from 0 9 kg m3 to 1 2 kg m3 the pumped water flow rate decreases more nearly 80 m3 h this means that the greater the difference in density the harder it is to pump the water besides the curves are convex and therefore have intersections with x and y axes the intercept on y axes means the upwelling flow rate when there is no density difference all the wave energy obtained by the pipe is used to overcome the friction loss and to give kinetic energy to the water the intercept on x axes means there is a maximum value of density difference which cannot be exceeded if the upwelling wants to continue to exist for example when the significant wave height is 2 8 m and the wave period is 16 34s the boundary value of density difference is about 1 25 kg m3 if the density difference exceeds the border the flow rate turns to 0 m3 h it is worth mentioning that the negative pressure caused by wave always exists but it cannot afford the density difference head anymore 4 3 pumped water flow rate significant wave period characteristics in fig 4 it can be seen that both the significant wave period and the significant wave height affect the upwelling flow rate fig 5 is the variations of pumped water flow rate vs significant wave period for different density differences and presents relationship between the significant wave period and the upwelling flow rate more specifically it shows that the pumped upwelling flow rate decreases while the significant wave period increases the reason for this trend can be explained in terms of power fig 6 is the wave spectra with four different significant wave periods and a same wave height the spectral peaks and the peak wave frequencies are different and it is difficult to compare the amount of energy contained in the four however the integral of the secondary moment of wave spectrum that causes the pressure difference decreases with the increase of the significant wave period see fig 7 the integral of the secondary moment of wave spectrum here may be seen as another form of power because the trend of the curve in fig 7 is the same as which in fig 5 besides the curves are concave and have no intersection with x or y axis it means that when the significant wave period goes to zero the power captured by the device can lift up a large volume of water and when the wave period tends to infinity although the upwelling still exists it becomes too small to be observed 4 4 pumped water flow rate significant wave height characteristics the variations of pumped water flow rate vs significant wave height for different density differences are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the relationship curve is a straight line under each period condition which means there is a positive correlation between the flow rate and the significant wave height the higher the significant wave height the greater the flow the maximum flow rate of the experiments almost reaches 480 m3 h when the significant wave height is 5 2 m the wave period is 16 34s and the density difference is 0 3 kg m3 the desirable value shows that the capacity of wave pump is worth to build a pilot prototype model another important parameter is the minimum value of significant wave height which is represented by the intersection point of the curve and the x axis in fig 8 for example the minimum value of significant wave height h 1 3 m i n that can produce upwelling is 2 9 m in case of the significant wave period 16 34s and the density difference 1 2 kg m3 and this minimum value predicted by the proposed model might be instructive to the application of wave pump in sea trials 5 conclusion in this paper the performance of the wave pump for artificial upwelling in irregular waves is investigated both theoretically and experimentally a theoretical model of the wave pump under irregular wave conditions is presented and the jonswap spectrum data are employed for the calculations the empirical model explains the reasons for the formation of upwelling from the perspective of energy and the validity of the proposed model is verified by the experimental results the similarity theory is applied to confirm that the experiment operates similarly to the full scale system the results show that under the conditions where irregular waves substitute for regular waves the wave pump has potential for upwelling though the preliminary theoretical formulas and experiments have some limitations and require further improvement and perfection yet the presented model can be utilized to predetermine operating conditions and to select optimal process parameters the results show that the pumped water flow rate strongly depends on significant wave heights significant wave periods and density differences between dow and the surface water there is negative correlation between the upwelling flow rate and the density difference and the maximum water flow rate occurs when the density difference goes to zero furthermore under a determined wave condition the relation curve shows a boundary value of density difference which cannot be exceeded if we want to produce upwelling besides the pumped water flow rate decreases with the increase of significant wave period the integral of the secondary moment of wave spectrum is proposed to explain this trend from the power point of view the pumped water flow rate is basically proportional to significant wave height a minimum significant wave height h 1 3 m i n is required to achieve an upwelling action and this special parameter can be used to select sea areas for trials in addition to the three major factors other factors like geometrical parameters of the pipe distance between the upper end of the pipe and the trough of the wave may have a certain effect on the performance of the wave pump further study should focus on the refinement of the empirical model and consider the effects of these less important parameters the theoretical model and the experimental results both confirm that even under irregular wave conditions the wave pump is still a promising and proven way to upwell nutrient rich dow to the euphotic layer and the process mimicking the natural upwelling may promote the growth of phytoplankton and thus to enhance primary production however as a preliminary and primitive marine artificial system the wave pump has only experienced the test of laboratory experiments further work aims at obtaining the performance

22493,artificial upwelling potentially stimulates the primary production in the ocean by bringing the nutrient rich deep ocean water dow up to the surface concepts of wave pumps have been proposed to induce upwelling flow in both regular and irregular waves however the experimental study on the performance of a novel type of wave pump in irregular waves has not yet been reported this paper presents a theoretical model and experimental data for the wave pump under irregular waves of various spectra the theoretical model took into account both the flow characteristics of the wave pump and the effect of stratification experiments were carried out on a device with 1 40 scale in wave flume and the pump capacity of the wave pump was assessed the model prediction basically agrees with the experimental findings the results show that the upwelling flow rate strongly depends on significant wave heights significant wave periods and density differences between dow and the surface water an upwelling flow of 2 480 m3 h can be induced by the wave pump under a wide range of irregular waves further study will focus on the practical application of wave pump in the open sea keywords wave pump artificial upwelling deep ocean water irregular waves 1 introduction artificial upwelling concepts of bringing up nutrient rich dow to the euphotic layer have been proposed to promote phytoplankton growth and thus to enhance primary production in the ocean over the past few decades the development of energy conversion technologies makes possible engineering applications of artificial upwelling the viable artificial upwelling systems can be classified by their energy supplies as perpetual salt fountain air lift pump and wave pump isaacs and castel 1976 liang 1996 stommel and arons 1956 stommel and arons 1956 first proposed the concept of a perpetual salt fountain in many tropical and subtropical regions continuous upwelling could be maintained as long as the differences of temperature and salinity exists utilizing the concept tsubaki et al 2004 developed an apparatus to capture the upwelling flow the flow rate with a single pipe was estimated to be 45 m 3 day tsubaki et al 2007 to produce large scale ecological effects requires employing a large number of pipes williamson et al 2009 but expenses resulting from deployment and maintenance might be very high the air lift pump proposed by liang 1996 can produce significant upwelling flow rate by injecting air into water liangpeng 2005 however there is still difficulty for the long term application of the air lift pump since relatively complicated electromechanical systems used in the air lift pump are vulnerable to occasionally severe sea conditions ocean waves are a huge largely untapped energy resource and the potential of extracting energy from waves as the power source for artificial upwelling is considerable a few different techniques for artificial upwelling by using wave energy have been studied isaacs and castel 1976 took the first step to propose a simple wave powered pump liujin 1995 developed a wave driven artificial upwelling device consisting of a buoy and a vertical long pipe with a flow controlling valve when heaving in the ambient waves the device can keep the inside water moving upward because of inertial forces bringing the dow to surface kenyon 2007 simplified the wave pump into an apparatus that contains only the pipe the open ended rigid and impermeable pipe is oriented strictly vertical and held in a fixed position so that the pipe will not oscillate with the imposed wave motion kenyon 2007 see fig 1 the upper end of the pipe is placed below the lowest troughs to ensure the device could capture the wave energy and not being exposed to the atmosphere at the same time the lower end is located at the depth where the fluid motion and pressure variations cannot be influenced by surface ocean waves according to bernoulli s principle a negative pressure would be generated when particle motion due to the wave moves across the top ending of the pipe and the pressure difference along the length of the pipe caused the fluid flow consistently upward kenyon 2007 in our previous study we performed experiments and theoretical analyses to obtain the performance of the wave pump in regular waves fan et al 2016 the results showed that the pump capacity and efficiency are functions of the product of the wave amplitude and frequency geometrical parameters of the pipe and vertical distribution of water density an upwelling flow of 5 360 m3 h can be generated by the wave pump under a wide range of wave conditions however no experiment nor data on the performance of the novel wave pump in irregular waves was found in the literature the main objective of this paper is to estimate the performance of the wave pump in irregular waves the goal is reached by i the physical model tests were performed for case study where the jonswap spectrum was applied in the experiments ii a theoretical model was developed to predict the pumped water flow rate for a given random wave and was verified by the physical model tests the relationships between the irregular waves and the upwelling flow rate was clarified based on the model prediction which might be instructive to the application of wave pump in this paper the theoretical analysis and experimental setup are presented in section 2 and 3 respectively in section 4 the theoretical model is verified and three factors affecting upwelling flow rate density difference significant wave period and significant wave height are discussed conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 irregular waves the first order irregular waves can be decomposed into infinity many linear regular waves with different amplitudes frequencies and initial phases aggarwal et al 2016 finnegan and goggins 2015 li and lin 2012 yang et al 2013 the free surface elevation can be written as 1 η t i 1 n a i cos k i x ω i t ε i 2 ω i ω i δ ω a i 2 s ω i δ ω 3 k i 2 π λ i where η t is the free surface elevation n is the number of waves a i is the amplitude of each wave component k i is the wave number of each

called the peak enhancement factor the value of γ ranges between 1 and 7 with the mean of 3 3 hasselmann et al 1973 σ is the standard deviation values depending on the spectrum frequency f and peak

cosh k z d sinh k d a ω 2 where k is the wave number z is the vertical distance from sea surface d is the seawater depth a is the wave amplitude ω is the wave frequency the right hand side of eq 8 has

at the lower end g is the gravitational acceleration l and d are the length and diameter of the upwelling pipe respectively ρ l is the density of seawater at depth of l a π d 2 4 means the cross

calculated by using the iterative method 3 experimental setup 3 1 experimental setup in order to reduce both the cost and the complication of the full scale system a scaled down model was utilized to investigate the behavior of the wave pump in irregular waves the model experiments were conducted in a wave flume which is 75 m long 0 8 m wide and 1 2 m high in the hydraulic laboratory at zhejiang university china a schematic view of the experiments is shown in fig 2 the flume facility consists of a wave generator a wave absorber four wave gauges and a control center the wave generator relies on the wave height data from the wave gauges to execute negative feedback adjustment a servo driver germany s siemens pm340b and an ac servo motor are selected in the motor system of the generator and the rated power is 2 2 kw the wave absorber has the capability of efficiently absorbing reflected waves and eliminating the influence from unexpected waves control center is used to calculate the wave spectrum and control the wave generator to make irregular waves the other laboratory equipment includes an upwelling pipe an on off valve a test tank a pvc thin film bag full of the high density water which was mixed with the dye an electronic scale and a camera used to record the hydrodynamic process the diameter of the upwelling pipe is selected to be much smaller than the wave length of the surface gravity waves so as to minimize the disturbance to the wave motion by the pipe and to insure that the only forces inside the pipe is directed parallel to the pipe kenyon 2007 the test tank here is used to make sure that the pipe with an on off valve is always oriented vertically and to confirm that the velocity of the water in the tank is close to zero so that the hydrologic conditions of model is similar to the water in deep layer the upper cover of the test tank was designed to be openable and closable with a hole having a diameter slightly larger than the outer diameter of the pipe the rigid upwelling pipe inserted into the hole was fixed solidly to the cover the pvc thin film bag filled with high density water is tightly connected with the lower end of the pipe moreover the test tank is firmly fixed to the bottom of the flume so it cannot roll or vibrate even in very violent wave conditions by drilling a few small holes in the outer wall of the tank the water in the tank can be exchanged with the outside water guaranteeing the continuity of water inside and outside the tank besides the pvc thin film bag is used to continuously transfer the pressure of low density water in the tank to the high density water in the bag or the opposite the other function of the bag is to ensure that the high density water will not be polluted by the ambient water with the functions of the pvc thin film bag the pumped water flow rate then can be calculated by dividing the quantity of water that is drained out from the film bag by the experimental time fan et al 2016 a digital camera sony ilce 7rm2 a7rm2 was used to grab the image of upwelling flow the camera has a 42 4 megapixel photo resolution and exposure time is 1 8000 s each frame of image is digitized into 7952 x 5304 pixels each pixel is with a brightness of 8 bit resolution the maximum sampling rate for the image card is 5 frames per second by recording the video of the plume propagation and analyzing them frame by frame the velocities and paths could be calculated 3 2 similarity theory experimental simulation is an important approach to study the artificial upwelling and the similarity theory is an effective tool for the design of the scaled down model the basic requirements of the similarity theory include geometric similarity and dynamic similitude geometric similarity can be easily achieved by scaling all the length dimensions in the same ratio the length scale ratio d r is set as 18 d r d p d m where the subscripts p and m represent prototype and model respectively d r is also the ratio of the characteristic length of the prototype to the one of the model including the ratio of the pipe length l p l m the ratio of the water depth d p d m and the ratio of the significant wave height h 1 3 p h 1 3 m all of the characteristic lengths of the model are scaled in the same ratio so that geometric similarity makes sense to make good use of the flume the length scale ratio is set to be 40 the length of the prototype pipe proposed is 12 m so the length of the scaled model is to be 0 3 m besides the diameter of the model pipe is 45 mm proportionally converted from the 1800 mm diameter of the prototype pipe the requirement of dynamic similitude is that the froude number between prototype and model should be equal because the gravity and inertial forces are dominant and effect of remaining forces is small in the upwelling system the froude number is defined as 19 f r v g h where f r is the froude number v is the average value of the square of horizontal velocity in one period of wave at the pipe top end h is the negative pressure head generated by the wave pump to make the prototype and model similar we have 20 f r p v p g h p v m g h m f r m in the water field near the upper end of the pipe the ratio of velocity v p v m can also be the ratio of mean velocity of the water in vertical up flow u j p u j m since the similarity is established eq 20 then becomes 21 u j p u j m v p v m h p h m in wave induced artificial upwelling resistance from stratification and inertial forces are predominant whereas the remaining forces are comparatively small so the value of negative pressure head is approximately equal to the density head and the velocity head which can be written as 22 h h d h k δ ρ ρ 0 l u j 2 2 g where h d is the density head and h k is the velocity head substitute eq 22 into eq 21 eq 21 then becomes 23 u j p u j m δ ρ p ρ 0 p l p u j p 2 2 g δ ρ m ρ 0 m l m u j m 2 2 g the velocity ratio u j r can be solved as 24 u j r u j p u j m δ ρ ρ 0 r d r 1 2 from eq 24 we can find that it is not necessary to maintain the same density difference between model and prototype and the advantage of this is that we can adjust the water density differences in the experiment as we like the ratio of the flow rate q r and time t r then can be written as follows fan et al 2016 25 q r u j r d r 2 δ ρ ρ 0 r 1 2 d r 5 2 26 t r d r 1 2 δ ρ ρ 0 r 1 2 eq 25 shows that once the ratio of density difference and the ratio of length are identified the ratio of flow rate is determined the flow rate of prototype can be calculated when the flow rate of model is measured the characteristic parameter values of prototype and model are listed in table 1 3 3 experimental procedure the preparation for the experiment included the wave generator calibration and density solution configuration the wave generator calibration consisted of four main steps first the generator was turned on and started making irregular waves according to the theoretical spectrum which was calculated from the wave arguments assigned next the data of wave heights measured by the four wave gauges were sent to the control center and the fast fourier transformation fft algorithm was then used to find the actual spectrum third the computer compared the actual spectrum with the theoretical spectrum and ordered the wave generator to adjust the mapping parameters so that the two spectra were as identical as possible fourth the three steps above were repeated until we got the irregular waves we want table 2 is the comparison between target and measured parameters of irregular waves the result shows that the parameter deviation is less than 5 after the calibration the density solution configuration is to obtain solutions with different densities a salinity meter and a thermometer were used during the configuration process the international 1 atm equation of state of seawater milleropoisson 1981 was applied in the configuration the sets of experiments were conducted in irregular waves with significant wave periods ranging from 0 5 to 0 8 s corresponding to full scale significant wave periods ranging from 16 34 to 23 35 s the significant wave heights generated by the wave maker were 0 07 0 09 0 11 0 13 m equivalent to full scale waves of approximately 2 8 3 6 4 4 and 5 2 m height this study was aimed to obtain the performance of wave pump in the irregular waves full scale parameters were set and the laboratory parameters were calculated by using the similarity theory the experimental procedure is as follows 1 a little of red dye is injected into the boxes storing density solutions and the solutions is then stirred evenly 2 by using an immersible pump the dyed salt water is pumped from the boxes through a hose into the pvc thin film bag connected with the upwelling pipe 3 the pvc thin film bag filled with the high density water is weighed with an electronic scale the total weight is symbolized as m 0 4 the upwelling pipe is fixed on the test tank tightly by two straps which are thin enough to minimize their influence and the bag is placed in the tank in a stretched state in addition the air inside the bag is discharged and the on off valve is closed 5 after the water is stable the wave generator is started and the on off valve on the upwelling pipe is opened 1 min later then the water in the pvc thin film bag will be pumped into the flume because of the irregular waves 6 after a while the on off valve is closed again and the generator is stopped at the same time then the pvc thin film bag with the rest of salted water is taken out of the flume and weighed the total weight is marked as m 1 assume the time interval between the valve opened and closed is δ t the pumped water flow rate q w can be expressed as 27 q w m 0 m 1 ρ d δ t 7 repeat steps 2 6 and each experiment is repeated at least three times to minimize the occasional errors finally the pumped water flow rate q w for each given surface wave motion is obtained and draw the plots of flow rate to other parameters the tendency of the flow rate can be clarified clearly it is worth mentioning that during the whole process the water depth should be maintained at an appropriate level to guarantee that the pipe is totally submerged fig 3 shows 8 frames of an upwelling process the picture which was created by taking 1 frame every 5 frames demonstrates the ability of the wave pump to generate upwelling 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the theoretical model the experimental results at various significant wave heights and periods with four different densities are used to compare with the theoretical results to verify the validity of the proposed model in fig 3 the pumped water flow rate is plotted versus the density difference for the upwelling device used at different values of significant wave height and significant wave period these figures show that the results of the theoretical model are basically consistent with the experimental data but there are still some deviations table 3 can be used to explain the reasons for the deviations when the flow rate is small q w 99 m 3 h the flow inside the pipe is laminar flow when in the experiments in this case reynolds number governs however the flow is assumed always turbulent flow in the theoretical model where densimetric froude number governs the different flow regimes between experiments and the theoretical model lead to the errors the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the results of the theoretical model and experiments reaches a maximum of 17 8 which can be seen in fig 4 a with the flow rate increasing q w 99 m 3 h the laminar flow in the experiments transitions to turbulent flow the densimetric froude number starts to govern and the errors decrease and when the flow rate is large enough q w 173 m 3 h the nrmse reaches a minimum of 8 9 fig 4 d the average nrmse is 11 7 which is acceptable if the theoretical model is used to investigate the pump performance in the sea trails 4 2 pumped water flow rate density difference characteristics fig 4 shows the pumped water flow rate at different values of density difference fig 4 a b c d show the flow rate changing with the density difference for the same significant wave height and 4 different periods conditions from these figures the trend that the pumped water flow rate decreases with the increase of the density difference evidently appears the reason for the trend is that the pumping power obtained from the irregular waves is limited due to the given significant wave height and period but the energy consumption increases with the increase of the density difference in fig 4 d the black solid line shows that the pumped water flow rate decreases 40 m3 h when the density difference increases from 0 3 kg m3 to 0 6 kg m3 however even with the same increment when the density difference increases from 0 9 kg m3 to 1 2 kg m3 the pumped water flow rate decreases more nearly 80 m3 h this means that the greater the difference in density the harder it is to pump the water besides the curves are convex and therefore have intersections with x and y axes the intercept on y axes means the upwelling flow rate when there is no density difference all the wave energy obtained by the pipe is used to overcome the friction loss and to give kinetic energy to the water the intercept on x axes means there is a maximum value of density difference which cannot be exceeded if the upwelling wants to continue to exist for example when the significant wave height is 2 8 m and the wave period is 16 34s the boundary value of density difference is about 1 25 kg m3 if the density difference exceeds the border the flow rate turns to 0 m3 h it is worth mentioning that the negative pressure caused by wave always exists but it cannot afford the density difference head anymore 4 3 pumped water flow rate significant wave period characteristics in fig 4 it can be seen that both the significant wave period and the significant wave height affect the upwelling flow rate fig 5 is the variations of pumped water flow rate vs significant wave period for different density differences and presents relationship between the significant wave period and the upwelling flow rate more specifically it shows that the pumped upwelling flow rate decreases while the significant wave period increases the reason for this trend can be explained in terms of power fig 6 is the wave spectra with four different significant wave periods and a same wave height the spectral peaks and the peak wave frequencies are different and it is difficult to compare the amount of energy contained in the four however the integral of the secondary moment of wave spectrum that causes the pressure difference decreases with the increase of the significant wave period see fig 7 the integral of the secondary moment of wave spectrum here may be seen as another form of power because the trend of the curve in fig 7 is the same as which in fig 5 besides the curves are concave and have no intersection with x or y axis it means that when the significant wave period goes to zero the power captured by the device can lift up a large volume of water and when the wave period tends to infinity although the upwelling still exists it becomes too small to be observed 4 4 pumped water flow rate significant wave height characteristics the variations of pumped water flow rate vs significant wave height for different density differences are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the relationship curve is a straight line under each period condition which means there is a positive correlation between the flow rate and the significant wave height the higher the significant wave height the greater the flow the maximum flow rate of the experiments almost reaches 480 m3 h when the significant wave height is 5 2 m the wave period is 16 34s and the density difference is 0 3 kg m3 the desirable value shows that the capacity of wave pump is worth to build a pilot prototype model another important parameter is the minimum value of significant wave height which is represented by the intersection point of the curve and the x axis in fig 8 for example the minimum value of significant wave height h 1 3 m i n that can produce upwelling is 2 9 m in case of the significant wave period 16 34s and the density difference 1 2 kg m3 and this minimum value predicted by the proposed model might be instructive to the application of wave pump in sea trials 5 conclusion in this paper the performance of the wave pump for artificial upwelling in irregular waves is investigated both theoretically and experimentally a theoretical model of the wave pump under irregular wave conditions is presented and the jonswap spectrum data are employed for the calculations the empirical model explains the reasons for the formation of upwelling from the perspective of energy and the validity of the proposed model is verified by the experimental results the similarity theory is applied to confirm that the experiment operates similarly to the full scale system the results show that under the conditions where irregular waves substitute for regular waves the wave pump has potential for upwelling though the preliminary theoretical formulas and experiments have some limitations and require further improvement and perfection yet the presented model can be utilized to predetermine operating conditions and to select optimal process parameters the results show that the pumped water flow rate strongly depends on significant wave heights significant wave periods and density differences between dow and the surface water there is negative correlation between the upwelling flow rate and the density difference and the maximum water flow rate occurs when the density difference goes to zero furthermore under a determined wave condition the relation curve shows a boundary value of density difference which cannot be exceeded if we want to produce upwelling besides the pumped water flow rate decreases with the increase of significant wave period the integral of the secondary moment of wave spectrum is proposed to explain this trend from the power point of view the pumped water flow rate is basically proportional to significant wave height a minimum significant wave height h 1 3 m i n is required to achieve an upwelling action and this special parameter can be used to select sea areas for trials in addition to the three major factors other factors like geometrical parameters of the pipe distance between the upper end of the pipe and the trough of the wave may have a certain effect on the performance of the wave pump further study should focus on the refinement of the empirical model and consider the effects of these less important parameters the theoretical model and the experimental results both confirm that even under irregular wave conditions the wave pump is still a promising and proven way to upwell nutrient rich dow to the euphotic layer and the process mimicking the natural upwelling may promote the growth of phytoplankton and thus to enhance primary production however as a preliminary and primitive marine artificial system the wave pump has only experienced the test of laboratory experiments further work aims at obtaining the performance and potential ecosystem impacts of this technology in the sea trials acknowledgments this research is financially funded by the national key research and development program of china no 2016yfa0601400

has more parameters or higher order format which provides more chances of failing in practical application backstepping method is effective for the control of nonlinear system krstic et al 1995 in saberi et al 1989 integral term was introduced to the method backstepping method with integral term became a design technique for a recursive controller godhavn et al 1998 first introduced backstepping method into ship motion control field fossen and strand 1999 did some research on the application of backstepping method to ship motion control and the integral term was added to improve the course control performance for ships in roger and fossen thor 2004 however their controller was complex and unable to deal with inexact mathematical models to solve the problem guan et al 2009 proposed a concise nonlinear robust controller and used close loop gain shaping algorithm to overcome the static error chen and tan 2013 introduced backstepping method into ship trajactory tracking problem with fault tolerant control to avoid failure zhang et al 2015a applied neural network in backstepping to capture vehicle uncertainties nevertheless the steering frequency was not concerned in the above literatures which could lead to a severe wear on the rudder von ellenrieder 2018 considered the effect of input saturation and actuator rate limits under unknown time varying disturbances based on the researches above in order to find a simpler control law and reduce rudder wearing this research offers a new scheme generally the controller designed by backstepping is in pd format with a nonlinear damping term that cancels the nonlinearities of the mathematical model an integral term can be introduced to the controller to eliminate the static error caused by constant wind disturbance but this introduction brings additional parameters to be tuned the nonlinear control law designed by backstepping method usually is to cancel the nonlinearities of the system nevertheless in practice the nonlinearities is unlikely to be cancelled completely zhang 2012 zhang et al 2015b however if the control algorithm is robust and insensitive to the mathematical model perturbation it is reasonable to ignore that effect cgsa closed loop gain shaping algorithm is a concise robust control algorithm zhang 2012 the controller designed by cgsa has good robust performance simple controller structure and concise controller design procedures but the stability proof of cgsa controller is slightly difficult because of its constructional nature therefore we can make cgsa and backstepping method complement each other nonlinear feedback and nonlinear decoration are new discoveries of our team zhang and zhang 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2018 suppose e is the input of the controller and u is the output of the controller in traditional linear feedback mode u f e e researches focus on finding a better nonlinear function of f to make the system more stable accurate energy efficient and concise the error e is fed back directly to the controller without any processing further improvement of that mode is limited after decades of development nonlinear feedback research focuses on changing an existing control law u f e e into u f e g e by improving function g the control effect can be improved nonlinear decoration focuses on modifying the controller output it changes u f e e into h u f e e by now six forms of effective nonlinear feedback or decoration function have been found they are sine function arc tangent function sigmoid function power function hyperbolic tangent function and exponential function in general the adoption of the nonlinear decoration designing method cannot enhance the control performance of the system but it can reduce the energy consumption of controlling zhang et al 2018 therefore a concise robust integrator backstepping control methodology is proposed by combining integrator backstepping cgsa and nonlinear decoration of sine function in this paper in order to decrease the unreasonable steering frequency sea trail data is analyzed and the practical range of steering frequency is explored simulation results show that the proposed controller preserves the advantage of the three methods above avoids the defects of each and has good robustness to the perturbation of steering mechanisms and ship model its energy saving performance is also satisfactory and the algorithm is more consistent with navigation practice 2 the design of nonlinear robust controller for ship course keeping based on nonlinear decoration and integrator backstepping method to guarantee the ship course ψ tracks the desired course ψ r let x 1 ψ x 2 x 1 r ψ and e ψ ψ r where e is the tracking error the nonlinear dynamic model of the ship can be described as 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 f x 2 b u δ y x 1 where y r is the output of the system f x 2 k 0 t 0 h ψ h ψ α ψ β ψ 3 b k 0 t 0 u δ k 0 and t 0 are the maneuverability indices of ship δ is the input rudder angle α and β are nonlinear parameters δ is the uncertain disturbance generally δ is a bounded disturbance and its boundary is unknown thus δ ρ where ρ is an unknown constant for a system described as 1 the course keeping controller design method via backstepping is as follows firstly define the error of the system as 2 ξ z 2 z 1 x 1 ψ r z 2 x 2 σ where σ is the virtual control variable z 1 is the course tracking error ξ is an integral term introduced in the controller design to eliminate the static error caused by an uncertain interference term δ set the first lyapunov function as v 1 1 2 z 1 2 3 v 1 z 1 z 2 σ ψ r define the virtual control parameter as 4 σ c 1 z 1 ψ r where c 1 0 is a controller design parameter substitute 4 into 3 we have 5 v 1 c 1 z 1 2 z 1 z 2 define the second lyapunov function as 6 v 2 v 1 λ 2 ξ 2 1 2 z 2 2 where λ is a constant larger than 0 7 v 2 c 1 z 1 2 z 2 z 1 λ ξ z 2 considering 1 and 2 it can be obtained that 8 z 2 k 0 t 0 α x 2 β x 2 3 b u δ c 1 x 2 assuming there is no disturbance term δ in 8 equation 7 can be written as 9 v 2 c 1 z 1 2 z 2 z 1 λ ξ a 1 x 2 a 2 x 2 3 b u c 1 x 2 where a 1 k 0 t 0 α a 2 k 0 t 0 β then the control law is defined as 10 u 1 b a 1 x 2 a 2 x 2 3 λ ξ c 1 x 2 z 1 c 2 z 2 where c 2 0 is a design parameter substitute 10 into 9 we can get v 2 c 1 z 1 2 c 2 z 2 2 0 according to lyapunov stability theorem the error z 2 can be stabilized by the control law 10 when without consideration of interference term δ in order to eliminate the uncertain term δ control law u can be redesigned with the introduction of nonlinear damping term benaskeur and desbiens 2002 for the system 1 and system error definition 2 the control law of the system can be defined as 11 u 1 b a 1 x 2 a 2 x 2 3 λ ξ c 1 x 2 z 1 c 2 η z 2 where η 0 is a design parameter substitute 11 and 8 into 7 we get v 2 c 1 z 1 2 c 2 z 2 2 η z 2 2 z 2 δ to achieve v 2 0 only z 2 δ 0 needs to be proved since the inequality benaskeur and desbiens 2002 x y η x 2 1 4 η y 2 we have z 2 δ η z 2 2 δ 2 4 η then 12 v 2 c 1 z 1 2 c 2 z 2 2 δ 2 4 η c 2 z 2 2 δ 2 4 η hence c 2 z 2 2 δ 2 4 η should be guaranteed because δ ρ when the condition r z 2 z 2 ρ 2 η c 2 is satisfied v 2 is negative definite z 2 asymptotically convergent to ρ 2 η c 2 and the stability of the system error z 2 incorporating the uncertain disturbance can be guaranteed by the definition of the control law 11 through deep analysis according to benaskeur and desbiens 2002 the condition r is easily satisfied by selecting η and c 2 finally considering 1 2 4 and 11 the proposed control law of ship course keeping can be expressed as 13 u 1 b a 1 c 1 c 2 η x 2 a 2 x 2 3 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 η x 1 ψ r λ x 2 c 1 x 1 ψ r d t for control law 13 the tuning parameters c 1 c 2 η and λ are all required to be selected which indicates a difficult and time consuming procedure especially the arbitrary selection of the controller tuning parameters might reduce the convergence properties of the system therefore the simplification of the integrator backstepping controller is required in practice ψ r can be deemed as a step function so ψ r 0 let e 1 ψ r ψ ψ r x 1 then e 1 x 1 ψ x 2 then the control law 13 can be rewritten as 14 u 1 b a 1 c 1 c 2 η e 1 a 2 e 1 3 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 η e 1 λ e 1 c 1 e 1 d t a 2 b e 1 3 1 b 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 η λ e 1 λ c 1 e 1 d t a 1 c 1 c 2 η e 1 substitute 14 into 1 and suppose k p 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 η λ k i λ c 1 k d a 1 c 1 c 2 η then the obtained control law can be found to be composed of a nonlinear term and a linear pid controller 15 u a 2 b e 1 3 t 0 k 0 v β e 1 3 t 0 k 0 v where v k p e 1 k i e 1 d t k d e 1 therefore the control law 15 can be used directly when designing a nonlinear controller based on integrator backstepping methodology where the linear controller part v can be replaced by other linear controllers as long as k p k i and k d are positive in this paper the first order cgsa controller design scheme is used to design the linear pid controller v in 15 and the sensitivity function t of the closed loop system is given as 16 t 1 t 1 s 1 g k 1 g k where the controller k can be easily deduced based on the selection of the bandwidth frequency of the closed loop system 1 t 1 and the controlled plant g 17 k v e 1 1 g t 1 s the nomoto model can be used to design the linear part of the controller zhang and jin 2013 the standard linear nomoto model g ψ δ k 0 t 0 s 2 s can be obtained by omitting the nonlinear term and δ in 1 and transforming into transfer function format to eliminate the influence of static error of the system when cgsa controller design scheme is selected a small constant term ε could be introduced to the denominator of the transfer function of the model to represent the influence of uncertain constant disturbance to the ship hence the traditional nomoto model is expressed as 18 g k 0 t 0 s 2 s ε therefore the linear pid controller part of 15 is able to be expressed as 19 v 1 g t 1 s e 1 t 0 s 2 s ε k 0 t 1 s e 1 1 k 0 t 1 ε k 0 t 1 s t 0 k 0 t 1 s e 1 so the whole expression of nonlinear control law 15 can be rewritten as 20 u β e 1 3 s 3 t 0 k 0 1 k 0 t 1 ε k 0 t 1 s t 0 k 0 t 1 s e 1 remark vessels navigating on sea will face many interferences wave is usually deemed as output interference while wind is deem as input interference for output interference because nomoto model itself contains an integrator static error caused by output interference can be eliminated but for input interference its static error cannot be eliminated suppose the input signal d i is a step interference to the plant g y is the system output then for controller k s d p s p d p 1 s p 1 d 0 c p s q c p 1 s q 1 c 0 p q the transfer function of d i to y is y d i g 1 g k according to final value theorem y lim s 0 s g 1 g k d i s lim s 0 k 0 d i s t 0 s 1 1 k 0 s t 0 s 1 k d i c 0 d 0 so the system static error is d i c 0 d 0 because d i 0 only when c 0 0 the static error is 0 therefore the controller needs an integral term for eliminating the input interference the nonlinear control law 20 is composed of a nonlinear term and a linear pid controller which has the same structure as 14 the controller in 20 has satisfactory robustness because cgsa is a robust algorithm zhang 2012 at present only one design parameter t 1 that has definite physical meaning is to be selected rather than the original four arbitrary parameters according to zhang et al 2018 to reduce energy consumption the original control law is nonlinear decorated by a sine function then the nonlinear decoration control law u can be obtained as followed 21 u sin ω u where 0 ω 1 because rudder angle is generally limited within 25 the maximum absolute value of u is 0 436 rad so ωu is small we have sin ωu ωu stability analysis and effect analysis is demonstrated by final value theorem and closed loop gain shaping of h robust control theory control law 21 is the final format of our course keeping controller through modified integrator backstepping methodology the controller design procedure is definite and simple without reducing the robustness and control performance with only two tuning parameters to be designed 3 simulation results and analysis in this section the nonlinear nomoto model zhang and jin 2013 of training vessel yukun is used to verify the control effect the model consists of a rudder servo model and a nonlinear ship model as shown in fig 1 principle particulars of the ship are given in table 1 based on these parameters the parameters for nomoto model is calculated as k 0 0 31s 1 t 0 64 53s α 8 00 and β 4295 02 the nonlinear decoration parameter ω is selected as 0 7 the spectrum of wave interference is 0 3 1 25 rad s in order to make the interference outside of the effective bandwidth of the closed loop control system the working bandwidth frequency of the course keeping controller should be selected as 1 3 rad s and thus the design parameter can be obtained as t 1 3s in practical ship maneuvering system the nonlinear feature of steering servomechanism has an unneglectable influence on the course keeping effectiveness hence a single oil path steering gear hydraulic system with analog control signal is introduced in the simulations the rudder servo model in fig 1 the maximum steering rate of the steer servomechanism is set as 5 s and the maximum steering angle is set as 25 for safe navigation the steering frequency is less considered when designing course keeping controller generally the interval of the steering operation of the deduced controller is around 0 3s 3s throughout the analysis of full scale experiment data of the training vessel yukun as shown in fig 2 the average manual operation rate is about 8s every time which means the steering frequency of the traditional controller is too fast and cannot meet the practical ship maneuvering requirements in this paper to achieve a better control performance the interval of steering automatic operation is set to 6s the nonlinear characteristics of the steering servomechanisms are also taken into considerations in the following experiments when navigating on sea wind and wave are important external disturbances to the ship course keeping so their influence should be considered in the simulation for sea wind it can be divided into two kinds the constant wind and the turbulent wind where the turbulent wind can be expressed as a white noise according to zhang 2012 the constant wind can be replaced by an equivalent leeway angle guo 1999 which can be deemed as a rudder angle δ wind and can be expressed as δ wind k 0 v r v 2 sin γ where k 0 is the leeway coefficient v r and v are the wind speed and ship speed respectively for sea wave a typical second order oscillation component driven by white noise is adopted to describe the sea waves model yang et al 2016 the transfer function of sea wave model of wind scale of beaufort no 6 can be expressed as h s 0 4198 s s 2 0 3638 s 0 3675 desired course is set as 80 when without wind ε 0 00 0 1 simulation result is shown in fig 3 obviously in nominal condition the controlled system has a short rising time without any overshoot and the steering operation is reasonable when the wind scale is beaufort no 6 wind direction set as 50 the calculated leeway is 3 then the interval of the steering operation is set as 6s simulation result ε 0 001 is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the controlling effect becomes worse with an 8 8 overshoot and the average steering angle is 5 2 because the controller is designed based on nominal model with perturbation on rudder servo system wind scale of beaufort no 6 wind and wave disturbance this slight performance deterioration is acceptable it indicates the robustness of the proposed controller is satisfactory to evaluate the control performance of different strategies a comprehensive performance evaluation index cpei j is defined in 22 the assessment of the different algorithms are shown in table 2 22 j 1 t o 0 t o δ ψ δ d t δ n t 0 10 exp e n 3 where t 0 is the total time δ ψ is the course error δ is the rudder angle δ n t 0 is the steering frequency e n is the static error we can see j is formed by 4 terms for each term when its contribution to j is 10 separately means average course error is 10 average absolute rudder angle is 10 average steering interval is 1s static error is 7 so generally j is less than 40 with the same condition as fig 4 this time we introduce a nonlinear decoration element into this system simulation result is shown in fig 5 the overshoot is enlarged to 10 1 but the mean rudder angle is decreased to 3 8 therefore energy consumption is reduced through nonlinear decoration both the two strategy do not consider steering frequency so the cpei of them is large still the same condition as fig 4 this time besides nonlinear decoration we introduce a zero order hold element with time 6s into this system simulation result is shown in fig 6 it is obvious that the steering frequency is much lower and now cpei becomes much smaller however the overshoot problem is not solved the overshoot is mainly caused by two reasons one is the wind interference the other is the integrator term detecting and tackling interference is relatively tough but it is easy to eliminate the negative effect of integrator term overshoot caused by integrator term is because initially the difference between desired value and output value is too large therefore it is reasonable to decrease this difference by adding a first order inertial component to the desired course and this is equivalent to using the second order cgsa controller zhang 2012 inertia is the inherent property of ships thus for a specific ship its rise time for changing course must be larger than a certain value this is why delaying the desired course properly does not affect rising time with the same condition as fig 6 and additionally add this method we can get the solid line in fig 7 the overshoot becomes 5 9 which is 42 2 less than before this is the proposed control strategy in this paper fig 7 also illustrates that there will be a 4 static error if integrator term is not applied therefore the integrator term is necessary in order to further verify the robustness of the proposed controller the simplified nonlinear ship motion model shown in 1 is replaced by a complicated norrbin nonlinear mathematical model details of norrbin model can be got in claes et al 1977 or zhang and jin 2013 the model of rudder servomechanisms with 5s delay and the nonlinear model of wind and wave are also taken into consideration for wind scale of beaufort no 6 and 8 with wind direction 50 the maximum rudder speed and the maximum rudder angle of the steer servomechanism fig 1 remain the same as the above descriptions control strategy and other parameters are set the same as in fig 6 simulation results are shown in fig 8 fig 9 and table 2 with model perturbation the control performance and energy saving performance are still satisfactory under wind scale of beaufort no 6 the control effect and energy saving performance of the complex nonlinear model are even better than the simple nonlinear model one reasonable explanation is that since the rudder angle to balance leeway in the simple nonlinear model is concluded from navigation practice the value of it may be too large or the theoretical result is small comparing the simulation curves of the two both the trend of overshoot and the rise time are the same so we can say the designed controller is robust and is suitable for ship controlling under rough sea condition in order to integrate the experiments above and express them clearer table 2 is given with some indexes to express different methods or conditions they are ① use nonlinear decoration ② use steering interval restriction ③ change step reference into first order delayed reference ④ adopting integrator term ⑤ change simplified nonlinear model into nonlinear norrbin model ⑥ change of beaufort wind scale from no 6 to no 8 the second row ④ fig 4 is the classical integral backstepping method with parameter selected by cgsa the rows thereafter demonstrate the improvements and perturbation tests of the improved method 4 conclusions in this paper a concise robust integrator backstepping control methodology with nonlinear sine function decorated closed loop gain shaping algorithm is proposed it is found that the essence of the traditional integrator backstepping controller design methodology is composed of a linear pid controller and a nonlinear term of the model hence the cgsa controller design scheme which is a concise robust control algorithm and insensitive to the perturbation of model is used to design the linear controller then the control performance is improved by nonlinear decoration of sine function steering interval restriction and first order delayed reference the stability of the proposed nonlinear robust control law is proved based on lyapunov theorem and the robustness is verified through simulation the controller design procedure is definite and simple without reducing the robustness and control performance only two tuning parameters ω and t 1 are required to be selected and t 1 can be determined according to the system bandwidth the energy consumption of the proposed control strategy fig 7 solid line is reduced because the mean rudder angle is 17 3 lower than traditional control scheme fig 4 and the overshoot is 33 0 smaller the controller design concept proposed in this paper has a good theoretical analysis satisfying robustness with less parameters reasonable steering operation frequency and remarkable

backstepping method into ship motion control field fossen and strand 1999 did some research on the application of backstepping method to ship motion control and the integral term was added to improve the course control performance for ships in roger and fossen thor 2004 however their controller was complex and unable to deal with inexact mathematical models to solve the problem guan et al 2009 proposed a concise nonlinear robust controller and used close loop gain shaping algorithm to overcome the static error chen and tan 2013 introduced backstepping method into ship trajactory tracking problem with fault tolerant control to avoid failure zhang et al 2015a applied neural network in backstepping to capture vehicle uncertainties nevertheless the steering frequency was not concerned in the above literatures which could lead to a severe wear on the rudder von ellenrieder 2018 considered the effect of input saturation and actuator rate limits under unknown time varying disturbances based on the researches above in order to find a simpler control law and reduce rudder wearing this research offers a new scheme generally the controller designed by backstepping is in pd format with a nonlinear damping term that cancels the nonlinearities of the mathematical model an integral term can be introduced to the controller to eliminate the static error caused by constant wind disturbance but this introduction brings additional parameters to be tuned the nonlinear control law designed by backstepping method usually is to cancel the nonlinearities of the system nevertheless in practice the nonlinearities is unlikely to be cancelled completely zhang 2012 zhang et al 2015b however if the control algorithm is robust and insensitive to the mathematical model perturbation it is reasonable to ignore that effect cgsa closed loop gain shaping algorithm is a concise robust control algorithm zhang 2012 the controller designed by cgsa has good robust performance simple controller structure and concise controller design procedures but the stability proof of cgsa controller is slightly difficult because of its constructional nature therefore we can make cgsa and backstepping method complement each other nonlinear feedback and nonlinear decoration are new discoveries of our team zhang and zhang 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2018 suppose e is the input of the controller and u is the output of the controller in traditional linear feedback mode u f e e researches focus on finding a better nonlinear function of f to make the system more stable accurate energy efficient and concise the error e is fed back directly to the controller without any processing further improvement of that mode is limited after decades of development nonlinear feedback research focuses on changing an existing control law u f e e into u f e g e by improving function g the control effect can be improved nonlinear decoration focuses on modifying the controller output it changes u f e e into h u f e e by now six forms of effective nonlinear feedback or decoration function have been found they are sine function arc tangent function sigmoid function power function hyperbolic tangent function and exponential function in general the adoption of the nonlinear decoration designing method cannot enhance the control performance of the system but it can reduce the energy consumption of controlling zhang et al 2018 therefore a concise robust integrator backstepping control methodology is proposed by combining integrator backstepping cgsa and nonlinear decoration of sine function in this paper in order to decrease the unreasonable steering frequency sea trail data is analyzed and the practical range of steering frequency is explored simulation results show that the proposed controller preserves the advantage of the three methods above avoids the defects of each and has good robustness to the perturbation of steering mechanisms and ship model its energy saving performance is also satisfactory and the algorithm is more consistent with navigation practice 2 the design of nonlinear robust controller for ship course keeping based on nonlinear decoration and integrator backstepping method to guarantee the ship course ψ tracks the desired course ψ r let x 1 ψ x 2 x 1 r ψ and e ψ ψ r where e is the tracking error the nonlinear dynamic model of the ship can be described as 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 f x 2 b u δ y x 1 where y r is the output of the system f x 2 k 0 t 0 h ψ h ψ α ψ β ψ 3 b k 0 t 0 u δ k 0 and t 0 are the maneuverability indices of ship δ is the input rudder angle α and β are nonlinear parameters δ is the uncertain disturbance generally δ is a bounded disturbance and its boundary is unknown thus δ ρ where ρ is an unknown constant for a system described as 1 the course keeping controller design method via backstepping is as follows firstly define the error of the system as 2 ξ z 2 z 1 x 1 ψ r z 2 x 2 σ where σ is the virtual control variable z 1 is the course tracking error ξ is an integral term introduced in the controller design to eliminate the static error caused by an uncertain interference term δ set the first lyapunov function as v 1 1 2 z 1 2 3 v 1 z 1 z 2 σ ψ r define the virtual control parameter as 4 σ c 1 z 1 ψ r where c 1 0 is a controller design parameter substitute 4 into 3 we have 5 v 1 c 1 z 1 2 z 1 z 2 define the second lyapunov function as 6 v 2 v 1 λ 2 ξ 2 1 2 z 2 2 where λ is a constant larger than 0 7 v 2 c 1 z 1 2 z 2 z 1 λ ξ z 2 considering 1 and 2 it can be obtained that 8 z 2 k 0 t 0 α x 2 β x 2 3 b u δ c 1 x 2 assuming there is no disturbance term δ in 8 equation 7 can be written as 9 v 2 c 1 z 1 2 z 2 z 1 λ ξ a 1 x 2 a 2 x 2 3 b u c 1 x 2 where a 1 k 0 t 0 α a 2 k 0 t 0 β then the control law is defined as 10 u 1 b a 1 x 2 a 2 x 2 3 λ ξ c 1 x 2 z 1 c 2 z 2 where c 2 0 is a design parameter substitute 10 into 9 we can get v 2 c 1 z 1 2 c 2 z 2 2 0 according to lyapunov stability theorem the error z 2 can be stabilized by the control law 10 when without consideration of interference term δ in order to eliminate the uncertain term δ control law u can be redesigned with the introduction of nonlinear damping term benaskeur and desbiens 2002 for the system 1 and system error definition 2 the control law of the system can be defined as 11 u 1 b a 1 x 2 a 2 x 2 3 λ ξ c 1 x 2 z 1 c 2 η z 2 where η 0 is a design parameter substitute 11 and 8 into 7 we get v 2 c 1 z 1 2 c 2 z 2 2 η z 2 2 z 2 δ to achieve v 2 0 only z 2 δ 0 needs to be proved since the inequality benaskeur and desbiens 2002 x y η x 2 1 4 η y 2 we have z 2 δ η z 2 2 δ 2 4 η then 12 v 2 c 1 z 1 2 c 2 z 2 2 δ 2 4 η c 2 z 2 2 δ 2 4 η hence c 2 z 2 2 δ 2 4 η should be guaranteed because δ ρ when the condition r z 2 z 2 ρ 2 η c 2 is satisfied v 2 is negative definite z 2 asymptotically convergent to ρ 2 η c 2 and the stability of the system error z 2 incorporating the uncertain disturbance can be guaranteed by the definition of the control law 11 through deep analysis according to benaskeur and desbiens 2002 the condition r is easily satisfied by selecting η and c 2 finally considering 1 2 4 and 11 the proposed control law of ship course keeping can be expressed as 13 u 1 b a 1 c 1 c 2 η x 2 a 2 x 2 3 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 η x 1 ψ r λ x 2 c 1 x 1 ψ r d t for control law 13 the tuning parameters c 1 c 2 η and λ are all required to be selected which indicates a difficult and time consuming procedure especially the arbitrary selection of the controller tuning parameters might reduce the convergence properties of the system therefore the simplification of the integrator backstepping controller is required in practice ψ r can be deemed as a step function so ψ r 0 let e 1 ψ r ψ ψ r x 1 then e 1 x 1 ψ x 2 then the control law 13 can be rewritten as 14 u 1 b a 1 c 1 c 2 η e 1 a 2 e 1 3 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 η e 1 λ e 1 c 1 e 1 d t a 2 b e 1 3 1 b 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 η λ e 1 λ c 1 e 1 d t a 1 c 1 c 2 η e 1 substitute 14 into 1 and suppose k p 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 η λ k i λ c 1 k d a 1 c 1 c 2 η then the obtained control law can be found to be composed of a nonlinear term and a linear pid controller 15 u a 2 b e 1 3 t 0 k 0 v β e 1 3 t 0 k 0 v where v k p e 1 k i e 1 d t k d e 1 therefore the control law 15 can be used directly when designing a nonlinear controller based on integrator backstepping methodology where the linear controller part v can be replaced by other linear controllers as long as k p k i and k d are positive in this paper the first order cgsa controller design scheme is used to design the linear pid controller v in 15 and the sensitivity function t of the closed loop system is given as 16 t 1 t 1 s 1 g k 1 g k where the controller k can be easily deduced based on the selection of the bandwidth frequency of the closed loop system 1 t 1 and the controlled plant g 17 k v e 1 1 g t 1 s the nomoto model can be used to design the linear part of the controller zhang and jin 2013 the standard linear nomoto model g ψ δ k 0 t 0 s 2 s can be obtained by omitting the nonlinear term and δ in 1 and transforming into transfer function format to eliminate the influence of static error of the system when cgsa controller design scheme is selected a small constant term ε could be introduced to the denominator of the transfer function of the model to represent the influence of uncertain constant disturbance to the ship hence the traditional nomoto model is expressed as 18 g k 0 t 0 s 2 s ε therefore the linear pid controller part of 15 is able to be expressed as 19 v 1 g t 1 s e 1 t 0 s 2 s ε k 0 t 1 s e 1 1 k 0 t 1 ε k 0 t 1 s t 0 k 0 t 1 s e 1 so the whole expression of nonlinear control law 15 can be rewritten as 20 u β e 1 3 s 3 t 0 k 0 1 k 0 t 1 ε k 0 t 1 s t 0 k 0 t 1 s e 1 remark vessels navigating on sea will face many interferences wave is usually deemed as output interference while wind is deem as input interference for output interference because nomoto model itself contains an integrator static error caused by output interference can be eliminated but for input interference its static error cannot be eliminated suppose the input signal d i is a step interference to the plant g y is the system output then for controller k s d p s p d p 1 s p 1 d 0 c p s q c p 1 s q 1 c 0 p q the transfer function of d i to y is y d i g 1 g k according to final value theorem y lim s 0 s g 1 g k d i s lim s 0 k 0 d i s t 0 s 1 1 k 0 s t 0 s 1 k d i c 0 d 0 so the system static error is d i c 0 d 0 because d i 0 only when c 0 0 the static error is 0 therefore the controller needs an integral term for eliminating the input interference the nonlinear control law 20 is composed of a nonlinear term and a linear pid controller which has the same structure as 14 the controller in 20 has satisfactory robustness because cgsa is a robust algorithm zhang 2012 at present only one design parameter t 1 that has definite physical meaning is to be selected rather than the original four arbitrary parameters according to zhang et al 2018 to reduce energy consumption the original control law is nonlinear decorated by a sine function then the nonlinear decoration control law u can be obtained as followed 21 u sin ω u where 0 ω 1 because rudder angle is generally limited within 25 the maximum absolute value of u is 0 436 rad so ωu is small we have sin ωu ωu stability analysis and effect analysis is demonstrated by final value theorem and closed loop gain shaping of h robust control theory control law 21 is the final format of our course keeping controller through modified integrator backstepping methodology the controller design procedure is definite and simple without reducing the robustness and control performance with only two tuning parameters to be designed 3 simulation results and analysis in this section the nonlinear nomoto model zhang and jin 2013 of training vessel yukun is used to verify the control effect the model consists of a rudder servo model and a nonlinear ship model as shown in fig 1 principle particulars of the ship are given in table 1 based on these parameters the parameters for nomoto model is calculated as k 0 0 31s 1 t 0 64 53s α 8 00 and β 4295 02 the nonlinear decoration parameter ω is selected as 0 7 the spectrum of wave interference is 0 3 1 25 rad s in order to make the interference outside of the effective bandwidth of the closed loop control system the working bandwidth frequency of the course keeping controller should be selected as 1 3 rad s and thus the design parameter can be obtained as t 1 3s in practical ship maneuvering system the nonlinear feature of steering servomechanism has an unneglectable influence on the course keeping effectiveness hence a single oil path steering gear hydraulic system with analog control signal is introduced in the simulations the rudder servo model in fig 1 the maximum steering rate of the steer servomechanism is set as 5 s and the maximum steering angle is set as 25 for safe navigation the steering frequency is less considered when designing course keeping controller generally the interval of the steering operation of the deduced controller is around 0 3s 3s throughout the analysis of full scale experiment data of the training vessel yukun as shown in fig 2 the average manual operation rate is about 8s every time which means the steering frequency of the traditional controller is too fast and cannot meet the practical ship maneuvering requirements in this paper to achieve a better control performance the interval of steering automatic operation is set to 6s the nonlinear characteristics of the steering servomechanisms are also taken into considerations in the following experiments when navigating on sea wind and wave are important external disturbances to the ship course keeping so their influence should be considered in the simulation for sea wind it can be divided into two kinds the constant wind and the turbulent wind where the turbulent wind can be expressed as a white noise according to zhang 2012 the constant wind can be replaced by an equivalent leeway angle guo 1999 which can be deemed as a rudder angle δ wind and can be expressed as δ wind k 0 v r v 2 sin γ where k 0 is the leeway coefficient v r and v are the wind speed and ship speed respectively for sea wave a typical second order oscillation component driven by white noise is adopted to describe the sea waves model yang et al 2016 the transfer function of sea wave model of wind scale of beaufort no 6 can be expressed as h s 0 4198 s s 2 0 3638 s 0 3675 desired course is set as 80 when without wind ε 0 00 0 1 simulation result is shown in fig 3 obviously in nominal condition the controlled system has a short rising time without any overshoot and the steering operation is reasonable when the wind scale is beaufort no 6 wind direction set as 50 the calculated leeway is 3 then the interval of the steering operation is set as 6s simulation result ε 0 001 is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the controlling effect becomes worse with an 8 8 overshoot and the average steering angle is 5 2 because the controller is designed based on nominal model with perturbation on rudder servo system wind scale of beaufort no 6 wind and wave disturbance this slight performance deterioration is acceptable it indicates the robustness of the proposed controller is satisfactory to evaluate the control performance of different strategies a comprehensive performance evaluation index cpei j is defined in 22 the assessment of the different algorithms are shown in table 2 22 j 1 t o 0 t o δ ψ δ d t δ n t 0 10 exp e n 3 where t 0 is the total time δ ψ is the course error δ is the rudder angle δ n t 0 is the steering frequency e n is the static error we can see j is formed by 4 terms for each term when its contribution to j is 10 separately means average course error is 10 average absolute rudder angle is 10 average steering interval is 1s static error is 7 so generally j is less than 40 with the same condition as fig 4 this time we introduce a nonlinear decoration element into this system simulation result is shown in fig 5 the overshoot is enlarged to 10 1 but the mean rudder angle is decreased to 3 8 therefore energy consumption is reduced through nonlinear decoration both the two strategy do not consider steering frequency so the cpei of them is large still the same condition as fig 4 this time besides nonlinear decoration we introduce a zero order hold element with time 6s into this system simulation result is shown in fig 6 it is obvious that the steering frequency is much lower and now cpei becomes much smaller however the overshoot problem is not solved the overshoot is mainly caused by two reasons one is the wind interference the other is the integrator term detecting and tackling interference is relatively tough but it is easy to eliminate the negative effect of integrator term overshoot caused by integrator term is because initially the difference between desired value and output value is too large therefore it is reasonable to decrease this difference by adding a first order inertial component to the desired course and this is equivalent to using the second order cgsa controller zhang 2012 inertia is the inherent property of ships thus for a specific ship its rise time for changing course must be larger than a certain value this is why delaying the desired course properly does not affect rising time with the same condition as fig 6 and additionally add this method we can get the solid line in fig 7 the overshoot becomes 5 9 which is 42 2 less than before this is the proposed control strategy in this paper fig 7 also illustrates that there will be a 4 static error if integrator term is not applied therefore the integrator term is necessary in order to further verify the robustness of the proposed controller the simplified nonlinear ship motion model shown in 1 is replaced by a complicated norrbin nonlinear mathematical model details of norrbin model can be got in claes et al 1977 or zhang and jin 2013 the model of rudder servomechanisms with 5s delay and the nonlinear model of wind and wave are also taken into consideration for wind scale of beaufort no 6 and 8 with wind direction 50 the maximum rudder speed and the maximum rudder angle of the steer servomechanism fig 1 remain the same as the above descriptions control strategy and other parameters are set the same as in fig 6 simulation results are shown in fig 8 fig 9 and table 2 with model perturbation the control performance and energy saving performance are still satisfactory under wind scale of beaufort no 6 the control effect and energy saving performance of the complex nonlinear model are even better than the simple nonlinear model one reasonable explanation is that since the rudder angle to balance leeway in the simple nonlinear model is concluded from navigation practice the value of it may be too large or the theoretical result is small comparing the simulation curves of the two both the trend of overshoot and the rise time are the same so we can say the designed controller is robust and is suitable for ship controlling under rough sea condition in order to integrate the experiments above and express them clearer table 2 is given with some indexes to express different methods or conditions they are ① use nonlinear decoration ② use steering interval restriction ③ change step reference into first order delayed reference ④ adopting integrator term ⑤ change simplified nonlinear model into nonlinear norrbin model ⑥ change of beaufort wind scale from no 6 to no 8 the second row ④ fig 4 is the classical integral backstepping method with parameter selected by cgsa the rows thereafter demonstrate the improvements and perturbation tests of the improved method 4 conclusions in this paper a concise robust integrator backstepping control methodology with nonlinear sine function decorated closed loop gain shaping algorithm is proposed it is found that the essence of the traditional integrator backstepping controller design methodology is composed of a linear pid controller and a nonlinear term of the model hence the cgsa controller design scheme which is a concise robust control algorithm and insensitive to the perturbation of model is used to design the linear controller then the control performance is improved by nonlinear decoration of sine function steering interval restriction and first order delayed reference the stability of the proposed nonlinear robust control law is proved based on lyapunov theorem and the robustness is verified through simulation the controller design procedure is definite and simple without reducing the robustness and control performance only two tuning parameters ω and t 1 are required to be selected and t 1 can be determined according to the system bandwidth the energy consumption of the proposed control strategy fig 7 solid line is reduced because the mean rudder angle is 17 3 lower than traditional control scheme fig 4 and the overshoot is 33 0 smaller the controller design concept proposed in this paper has a good theoretical analysis satisfying robustness with less parameters reasonable steering operation frequency and remarkable
