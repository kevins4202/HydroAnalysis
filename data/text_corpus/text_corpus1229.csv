6145,the important flux estimate of carbon exchange across the water air interface in river systems of the global carbon cycle are being increasingly recognized however these estimates have large uncertainty due to the incomplete temporal and spatial coverage of co2 flux here we evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics and controlling factors of co2 exchange across the water air interface and their potential role in regional and global carbon budgets in 25 river transects along guijiang river gjr southwestern china in july and december 2016 these river transects were divided into upstream us middle ms and downstream ds reaches in non karst karst and mixed areas respectively the riverine co2 fluxes showed obvious seasonal variations ranging from 5 62 5 93 g m2 d in summer to 1 25 4 02 g m2 d in winter with an average value of 3 44 5 48 g m2 d the riverine co2 fluxes exhibited significant spatial patterns where the highest and lowest averaged co2 fluxes occurred at ms in summer and winter respectively generally the river was a carbon source with respect to the atmosphere throughout the year however the co2 fluxes were obviously restrained by aquatic metabolism and the carbonate buffer system in winter additionally the absorbed co2 at ms was due to strong photosynthetic and carbonate buffer activities carbon loss via atmospheric exchange in the gjr river basin was 0 032 0 047 tg c yr which accounted for 20 1 of the riverine dissolved carbon fluxes 0 160 0 075 tg c yr thus 0 128tg c yr 1 was sequestered in the gjr basin our results demonstrate the need to emphasize the importance of aquatic photosynthesis and the carbonate buffer system in restraining co2 degassing in karst rivers it is important to underscore the detailed spatiotemporal changes in co2 flux to reduce uncertainty in current estimates of global riverine co2 emissions keywords carbon exchange seasonal and spatial variations carbonate buffer aquatic photosynthesis karst river systems 1 introduction rivers play an important role in biogeochemical reactions involving the global carbon cycle by linking terrestrial and marine carbon reservoirs rivers are typically considered to be the fluvial exporters of total organic and inorganic carbon 0 9 0 95 pg c yr from the terrestrial environment to the ocean cole et al 2007 regnier et al 2013 in recent years an evident co2 degassing effect has been found in the river system and the estimated range of co2 evasion flux across the water air interface in global rivers is 0 23 1 8 pg c yr richey et al 2002 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 butman and raymond 2011 aufdenkampe et al 2011 regnier et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 borges et al 2015 however these estimates represent a large uncertainty in the data covering nearly an entire order of magnitude this uncertainty is mainly related to the following three conditions 1 co2 partial pressure pco2 in rivers 2 gas transfer velocity and 3 surface areas of global streams and rivers raymond et al 2013 in particular the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in water has high spatial and temporal heterogeneities due to climatic and geological characteristics which brings great uncertainty to the intensity of co2 flux and co2 sink source across the water air interface in global rivers weyhenmeyer et al 2012 most of the early published pco2 data in surface waters estimates were focus on lakes and estuaries and were approximately many fold higher than the pco2 of the present atmospheric equilibrium cole et al 1994 raymond et al 1997 frankignoulle et al 1998 early direct measurements of large rivers and inland waters in the arctic have also demonstrated that pco2 is supersaturated park et al 1969 kling et al 1992 by evasion of this excess gaseous carbon surface waters can act as conduits for a significant flux of carbon from terrestrial pools to the atmosphere richey et al 2002 cole et al 2007 li et al 2013 pu et al 2017 several studies have been carried out on the temporal and spatial variations of the pco2 value and co2 fluxes in rivers which are controlled by complex biological chemical and physical factors for example yao et al 2007 believe that the pco2 value and co2 fluxes in the xijiang river basin show significant seasonal variation which is affected by in situ biological activities and rainfall processes peter et al 2014 also found significant seasonal diurnal and event driven changes in the pco2 value and co2 fluxes in alpine streams in short temporal changes mainly include seasonal variations diurnal variations individual events and interannual variations due to the climate aquatic respiration photosynthesis hydrologic dynamics and human activities hope et al 2004 yao et al 2007 wang et al 2007 koprivnjak et al 2010 lynch et al 2010 peter et al 2014 almeida et al 2017 pu et al 2017 2019 zhang et al 2017 in addition the spatial variations of pco2 values and co2 fluxes in rivers at global regional and watershed scales are controlled by the climate and geological conditions richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 aufdenkampe et al 2011 for example pco2 is usually higher in the lower reaches of the river for large rivers telmer and veizer 1999 hellings et al 2001 especially in estuaries frankignoulle et al 1998 raymond et al 2000 however for streams pco2 commonly declines from headwaters to downstream reaches as connectivity between streams and their catchments declines jones and mulholland 1998 studies have shown that co2 evasion from surface waters has been restrained in recent years including a decline in co2 degassing and an increase in co2 sinks due to the photosynthesis carbonate dissolution carbon sources and carbonate buffer capacity in rivers for example liu et al 2015 found that atmospheric co2 was taken up at noon at a rate as high as 3600 mg m2 h in the middle reaches of a karst pool in maolan due to the metabolic processes of aquatic plants similarly a significant co2 sink was proved for seasonal and diurnal scales in the two typical transects of the main stream of guijiang river due to carbonate dissolution and high primary productivity zhang et al 2017 in addition using data from 21 603 sites of the continental river monitoring network of the united states stets et al 2017 revealed that rivers with a high alkalinity content restrained the co2 degassing flux due to the influence of the carbonate buffer system the co2 fluxes could also be limited in carbonate dominated regions when compared to silicate terrains due to the different carbon sources khadka et al 2014 in summary the co2 sink source across the water air interface of rivers is not absolute undoubtedly significant spatiotemporal differences in the co2 flux intensity and co2 sink source effect lead to great uncertainty in the regional and global carbon budgets and cycles thus it is important to assess spatiotemporal changes in co2 flux intensity and co2 sink source across the water air interface in rivers so that we can obtain better insights into constraints on regional and global carbon budgets and cycles due to the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of co2 flux in terms of intensity and direction there is considerable uncertainty in the regional and global assessment of co2 flux and its control mechanisms moreover we are still unclear about the high spatiotemporal variation in restraining co2 degassing and its control mechanism to increase the constraints on riverine co2 flux intensity and the co2 sink source we measured the seasonal and spatial concentrations of river water chemistry and co2 fluxes across the water air interface in a subtropical karst river guijiang river gjr located in southwestern china we used these data to assess the seasonal and spatial dynamics of co2 and their potential role in regional and global carbon budgets we estimated the magnitude and direction of co2 fluxes at different spatiotemporal scales using time series physico chemical data isotope data and co2 flux data employing the floating chamber fc and the thin boundary layer tbl methods our observations indicate that seasonal and spatial co2 flux estimates must be considered in regional and global estimates of riverine co2 fluxes to minimize uncertainty in the estimates especially in restraining co2 degassing 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the guijiang river which forms a tributary of the pearl river originates from maoershan mountainat an elevation of 2142 m fig 1 the river is 438 km long and drains an area of 18790 km2 the average river gradient runoff depth and annual runoff are 0 43 1033 mm and 1 44 1010 m3 yr respectively the regional climate is dominated by the east asian monsoon which is characterized by a cold dry winter from late november through march and a hot rainy summer from april through october the annual average temperature is about 20 c in the gjr catchment from south to north and has significant spatial differences for example the annual average temperature in wuzhou city near the lower reaches is 21 c but in guilin in the middle reach it is only 18 c zhang 2013 as shown in fig 1 we chose 25 monitoring sites of the river and divided them into three parts based on rock types in the gjr catchment the upper reach with primary distribution of silurian granites ordovician cambrian shales and mud rocks intercalated with carbonate rocks us non karst area sites g1 g4 the middle reach with a wide distribution of devonian and carboniferous carbonate rocks ms karst area sites g5 g20 and the lower reach with a distribution of cambrian strata terrain composed largely of carbonate rocks intercalated with shales ds mixed area sites g21 g25 2 2 hydrochemical parameters water temperature ph dissolved oxygen saturation do turbidity tb and electrical conductivity spc were measured in situ at all 25 sites using a multi parameter meter ysi pro dss yellows springs ohio usa in july and december 2016 prior to each measurement the instrument was calibrated according to the manufacturer s specifications using ph buffers 4 00 7 00 and 10 00 and a 1413μs cm solution for spc the do saturation probe was calibrated with water saturated air uncertainty related to temperature ph do tb and spc was 0 1 c 0 01 ph unit 0 1 0 03 ntu and 1 μs cm respectively the light values were measured by a data logger light meter tes 1339r taiwan china and the photosynthetically active radiation par was calculated by multiplying the light values by the conversion coefficient 0 0185 in the 400 700 nm lightwave range 2 3 discrete sample collection and analysis discrete river waters were sampled at all 25 sites using syringes each sample was immediately filtered through 0 45 μm filter membranes and collected in pre rinsed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles 500 ml for major ion analyses samples for cations were acidified to ph 2 with hno3 samples used for the stable carbon isotope of dissolved inorganic carbon δ 13cdic analysis were filtered into 15 ml hdpe bottles through 0 22 µm acetate rayon filters these samples were immediately preserved using three drops of a saturated solution of hgcl2 to prevent microbial alteration all of the samples were stored in an ice box until delivery to the laboratory where they were kept chilled in a refrigerator at 4 c until analysis alkalinity was determined using hcl titration with a titrette digital titrator brand trading co ltd wertheim germany the titrant was 0 1 mmol l hcl and the titrationendpoint was ph 4 5 major anions cl so4 2 no3 were measured by an automated dionex ics 900 ion chromatograph based on the apha 2012 method rice et al 2012 major cations ca2 mg2 k and na were analyzed by icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo fisher scientific usa using a procedure based on epa method 200 7 estimated analytical errors were 5 the δ 13cdic values were analyzed using a mat 253 mass spectrometer coupled to a gas bench ii automated device with an analytical precision of 0 15 following a modified method of atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 the results were calibrated by the international standard vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb all of the laboratory analyses were carried out in the environmental and geochemical analysis laboratory at the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological science the hydrochemical datasets including ph water temperature and concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 were processed with the program watspec wigley 1977 to calculate the partial pressure of co2 pco2 and saturation index of calcite sic in river water the dic including species hco3 co3 2 co2aq and total dic was calculated by the co2sys procedure using the alkalinity and ph pierrot et al 2006 2 4 co2 fluxes across the water air interface 2 4 1 thin boundary layer tbl method co2 fluxes across the water air interface were calculated using the following equation based on fick s law unesco ihaghg 2010 1 flux k c water c air where flux is the co2 flux mg m2 h k is the gas transfer velocity cm h and c water c air is the co2 concentration difference between the water and air the atmospheric co2 concentration was measured by egm 5 pp systems usa in situ we calculated k using the temperature dependent schmidt number sc t for fresh water raymond et al 2012 2 k k 600 sc t 600 0 5 with 3 s c t 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t 2 0 04132 t 3 where t is the

channels 100 m wide different equations are available for large and small rivers because the gjr s width is usually greater than 100 m throughout the year we estimated k 600 using the large rivers formula alin et al 2011 4 k 600 4 46 7 11 u 10 where u 10 is the wind speed 10 m above the river u 10 is derived by 5 u z u κ ln z z 0 where u z is the mean wind speed m s at height z u is the

measurements by a hand held anemometer kanomax6036 japan inc and air temperature was measured by a temperature and humidity recorder ssn 71usb yuan heng tong technology co ltd china 2 4 2 floating chamber fc method the floating chamber is an inexpensive and convenient method to measure direct diffusive fluxes at the surface of aquatic ecosystems to measure co2 concentration we used an egm 5 pp systems usa in conjunction with a floating chamber designed independently for on line monitoring the floating chamber was a stainless steel cylinder with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 40 cm the volume of air trapped inside the chamber was 28 3 l the interior walls of the chamber were laminated with a heat insulating material to prevent overheating due to direct sunlight and a small fan was equipped inside the chamber to homogenize the gas a vent on the top of the chamber equilibrated the pressure inside the chamber with the atmospheric pressure prior to each measurement liu et al 2014 the chamber was connected to the egm 5 with tygon tubing in a closed loop and air was circulated using the egm 5 s internal pump the air coming from the chamber was passed through a desiccant to prevent water condensation in the tubing the initial increase in pco2 in the chamber was plotted against time and the slope of the increase found by linear regression analysis was used to estimate the flux of co2 across the air water interface 6 flux slope f 1 f 2 v s with 7 f 1 f 3 f 4 atmp r 273 13 t where flux is the co2 flux mg m2 h slope is the slope in the time concentration plot 10 6 min 1

temperature c 2 4 3 comparison of tbl and fc methods as shown in table 1 the average co2 fluxes obtained by the tbl in winter and summer in guijiang river basin had greater variation range and higher values than those obtained by the fc about 1 3 and 1 8 times respectively those obtained by the fc in addition the results of the two methods in the co2 sink source were relatively consistent and only three co2 fluxes showed inconsistencies in the co2 sink source table 1 the absolute value of the ratio α in co2 fluxes between tbl and fc was 0 08 19 62 the average value was 2 77 and the median value was 1 41 the α values were relatively concentrated in the range of 0 2 in which the values less than 1 account for 38 7 of all values and values between 1 and 2 accounted for 22 5 fig 2 as shown in fig 3 the distributions obtained by the two methods were basically the same and the degree of dispersion was not that different in addition the results obtained by the two methods showed good positive correlation r 0 49 p 0 05 indicating that the two methods differed only slightly in the monitoring of the guijiang river basin this verified the accuracy of the two methods the results of the tbl were more complete had a larger range of changes and could better reflect the spatial and temporal differences of guijiang river basin therefore we used co2 fluxes estimated from the tbl method for further discussion in this study and the values from the fc are presented only for comparison 3 results 3 1 physicochemical and hydrological parameters the physicochemical and hydrological statistics of the monitored transections are listed in table 2 the tair do and par showed significant seasonal and spatial differences p 0 001 as expected air temperature tair decreased from 35 1 c 2 6 c in summer to 21 8 c 4 5 c in winter on the contrary the water dissolved oxygen do saturation increased from 99 7 7 8 in summer to 111 1 21 1 in winter with both the highest and lowest average values appeared in ms the par varied from 675 3 403 9 μmol m2 s in winter to 1001 1 598 1 μmol m2 s in summer spatial par averages increased along the flow direction in both summer and winter low velocities were observed in both summer and winter with an average 0 26 0 30 m s in summer and 0 11 0 16 m s in winter similar k600 averages 9 9 4 7 cm h in summer and 11 0 7 3 cm h in winter were observed across the seasons which coincided with the observations of seasonal flow velocity both flow velocity and k600 showed no significant seasonal differences p 0 05 3 2 dic species statistically significant differences in dic species including water temperature ph co3 2 and dissolved co2 t test p 0 001 occurred across seasons and river sections fig 4 as expected a higher average water temperature twater occurred in summer 28 1 c 1 7 c about 1 7 fold that observed in winter 16 7 c 1 5 c ph varied from 7 07 to 9 05 over time and across the watershed on average the maximum ph value of 8 40 0 42 and the minimum value of 7 17 0 08 were observed at ms in winter and at us in summer respectively fig 4b the same seasonal and spatial variations occurred for alkalinity dic and co3 2 fig 4c e dissolved co2 averaged 28 0 16 6 μmol l in summer and 8 6 10 2 μmol l in winter with both the maximum value 32 3 19 2 μmol l and minimum value 8 4 12 4 μmol l at ms fig 4f hco3 was considered the dominant component of dic and averaged 1028 8 522 7 μmol l in summer and 1149 5 547 3 μmol l in winter accounting for 95 3 and 91 0 respectively of dic on average fig 4e 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of pco2 the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 in gjr displayed pronounced temporal variations table 2 on average the pco2 levels were significantly higher in summer 1944 3 1158 6 μatm than in winter 650 9 691 5 μatm about three times greater t test p 0 01 the average pco2 value in surface water was 1297 6 1148 2 μatm in gjr table 2 the pco2 in the guijiang river exhibited diverse spatial patterns fig 4g the pco2 levels ranged from 575 4 μatm to 6166 0 μatm in summer and from 38 9 μatm to 3162 3 μatm in winter t test p 0 01 both the highest 6166 0 μatm and lowest 38 9 μatm pco2 occurred at the ms the spatial average value of pco2 indicated that pco2 first increased from us to ms and then decreased from ms to ds along the flow direction in summer whereas the reverse phenomenon was observed in winter fig 4g the results showed about 78 of samples were supersaturated in co2 compared to the atmospheric co2 equilibrium 3 4 co2 fluxes significant differences in co2 fluxes were found in guijiang river between seasons t test p 0 01 with average values varying from 28 4 91 4 mmol m2 d in winter to 127 8 134 7 mmol m2 d in summer table 2 the average co2 fluxes in summer were significantly higher than those in winter approximately 4 5 times t test p 0 01 the spatial average showed that the largest co2 fluxes occurred at ms 154 6 160 0 mmol m2 d in summer these were much larger than the fluxes at us 95 3 6 1 8 mmol m2 d and ds 68 0 40 6 mmol m2 d however co2 fluxes declined significantly at ms 30 1 113 3 mmol m2 d in winter to be comparable to those at us 31 7 45 9 mmol m2 d and ds 20 3 18 3 mmol m2 d co2 exchange showed a negative flux at ms for some time points in winter appearing as a co2 sink fig 4h 4 discussion 4 1 controls on co2 fluxes the co2 fluxes were affected by complex biological chemical and physical processes including the production and transport of soil co2 in situ respiration and degradation photosynthesis by aquatic plants and co2 transfer velocities richey 2003 yao et al 2007 however the co2 transfer velocities showed no significant seasonal or spatial differences p 0 05 table 3 in gjr thus indicating that other processes were more important than co2 transfer velocities regarding co2 flux changes the pco2 values and co2 fluxes were both significantly higher in summer than in winter in gjr fig 4g h gjr drains a subtropical monsoon area where higher precipitation corresponds to warmer seasons and vice versa therefore significantly higher air temperature 35 1 c 2 6 c vs 21 8 c 4 5 c par 1001 1 598 1 μmol m2 s vs 675 3 403 9 μmol m2 s and more precipitation occurred in summer than in winter table 3 this is conducive to vegetation growth and organic matter degradation and enhances the soil co2 content by co2 respiration more precipitation will flush the soil with a high co2 content into the river water hope et al 2004 li et al 2013 which results in pco2 supersaturation in river waters and increases co2 flux in summer certainly the pco2 will change across seasons or across different stretches of the river by the varying the relative dominance of in situ respiration and the degradation of organic matter versus photosynthesis yao et al 2007 this then makes the co2 flux rise or fall the do saturation had strong negative correlations with pco2 in winter r2 0 86 p 0 01 but not in summer r2 0 03 which reflects biogenic activities in the water of gjr in winter in addition the mean do saturation in summer was significantly lower than that in winter 99 7 7 8 vs 111 1 21 1 it was under saturated in summer and oversaturated in winter thus indicating that more intense photosynthesis occurred in winter the degree of photosynthesis and respiration in the sub aquatic community in the river is mainly controlled by seasonal and spatial changes in winter temperature turbulence and flow velocity barth and veizer 1999 the turbidity and flow velocity in summer were much higher than those in winter mean 17 6 8 7 ntu vs 2 2 2 0 ntu in turbidity and mean 0 26 0 30 m s vs 0 11 0 16 m s in flow velocity which possibly restrain the intensity of photosynthesis due to a greater disturbance in summer table 3 barth and veizer 1999 on the contrary a relatively high water temperature in a subtropical winter with lower turbidity and flow velocity is more conducive to the photosynthesis of aquatic plants meybeck 1993 ludwig et al 1996 which makes pco2 lower in winter and reduces the co2 flux according to the above discussions significant biological activities occurred in winter but not in summer in summer the mean do saturation at ms 97 2 8 3 was lower than that at us 103 9 3 4 and ds 104 5 5 5 and was under saturated table 3 therefore less co2 was consumed during photosynthesis in the sub aquatic community leading to the largest mean co2 evasion flux appearing at ms in winter the mean do saturation at ms 115 7 24 7 was higher than that at us 101 3 11 2 and showed oversaturation thus indicating that more intense photosynthesis occurred at ms therefore a significant co2 sink appeared at ms in addition the catchment lithology could be an important controlling factor of riverine co2 martin 2017 pu et al 2017 for example the co2 evasion fluxes could be limited in the carbonate dominated regions compared to silicate terrains khadka et al 2014 however the co2 evasion fluxes at ms were lower than those at us in winter but were much higher in summer this implies that different rock characteristics and water environments could affect pco2 and co2 flux variations by changing the input or output of co2 sources and variation of carbon at different spatial and temporal scales yao et al 2007 4 2 sources and variations of riverine dic the major carbon sources of dic in rivers are 1 atmospheric co2 2 respired soil co2 and 3 co2 derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals the c isotope values of dic with potential biological sources atmospheric sources and geological sources can be used to reveal the relative contributions from each source telmer and veizer 1999 brunet et al 2005 khadka et al 2014 generally atmospheric co2 is inconsequential or secondary telmer and veizer 1999 which is consistent with the fact that gjr mainly exhibits co2 degassing the dissolution of carbonate minerals is controlled by the hydrolysis of dissolved co2 generally half or more of the dic may originate from carbonate minerals depending on the amount of dissolution telmer and veizer 1999 the isotopic value of the combined dic should be around 12 depending on the relative amounts of mineral dissolution and dissolved co2 and the isotopic composition mook and de vries 2000 doctor et al 2008 khadka et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 a relatively high δ 13cdic values were clustered above the level of 12 indicating that carbonate rocks are a significant source in gjr fig 5a shows the changing trend of dic and δ 13cdic values in gjr basin the spatial distribution of dic and δ 13cdic values in gjr is strongly controlled by geology on average the dic concentrations and δ 13cdic values at ms were higher than that those at us and ds in both summer and winter in addition more carbonate rock dissolution may cause higher δ 13cdic values given the positive correlation r2 0 49 p 0 001 between δ 13cdic values and sic in gjr fig 5b the downstream increase in δ 13cdic values from the us in both summer and winter coupled with a sharp growth in sic table 2 suggests a significant influence of carbonate dissolution at ms which is consistent with the main distribution of carbonate rocks in the middle reaches in addition the δ 13cdic values were also affected by several biogeochemical processes in the channel including biological processes photosynthesis and respiration of sub aquatic community and carbonate mineral precipitation photosynthesis should increase both the δ 13cdic values and do concentrations since aquatic plants preferentially incorporate 12c and release o2 khadka et al 2014 photosynthesis would affect the river δ 13cdic values due to the significant positive correlation r2 0 50 p 0 001 between the δ 13cdic value and do saturation in winter fig 5c in addition calcite precipitation would produce only an approximately 0 5 to 1 depletion in 13c in the residual dic under equilibrium conditions however the δ 13cdic values increased from the us to ms in both summer and winter these results indicated that calcite precipitation should affect δ 13cdic values only slightly in a short compared with summer the higher δ 13cdic values in winter were affected by higher carbonate rock dissolution and photosynthesis in addition the carbonate rocks were the major carbon sources at ms in both summer and winter however the co2 fluxes showed a significant decline in winter at ms and a co2 sink appeared therefore some processes within rivers may play a more important role than the carbon sources in limiting co2 evasion such as the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and carbonate dissolution khadka et al 2014 pu et al 2017 4 3 processes restraining co2 evasion this study measured a total average co2 flux of 127 8 mmol m2 d over all of the sampling sites with a maximum value of 266 5 mmol m2 d at gjr site 16 in summer in winter we measured a total average co2 flux of 28 4 mmol m2 d over all sampling sites with minimum value of 45 8 mmol m2 d at gjr site 5 a significant decreasing trend from summer to winter in co2 fluxes was found in gjr the maximum decrease in co2 fluxes occurred at ms with the average values varying from 154 6 160 0 mmol m2 d in summer to 30 1 113 3 mmol m2 d in winter table 2 in short significant co2 degassing fluxes were limited in gjr in winter especially at ms where the co2 sink appeared both do and co2 concentrations are controlled directly by photosynthesis and respiration of sub aquatic plants algae and microbes the changes in pco2 also alter ph values doctor et al 2008 do saturation had a strong negative correlation with pco2 r2 0 82 p 0 01 and a strong positive correlation with ph in winter fig 6 a b which reflects the control of photosynthesis and respiration of the sub aquatic community on do and pco2 the correlation between pco2 and ph indicates that the hydration of co2 is the primary acid source in the system photosynthesis induced decreases in pco2 also restrain co2 fluxes by decreasing the gradient between the dissolved co2 and atmospheric pco2 carpenter et al 2001 pu et al 2017 as mentioned above the relatively high water temperature slow water flow low turbulence and high residence time during this period might provide a favorable environment for microbial activities in winter table 2 meybeck 1993 ludwig et al 1996 in addition the pco2 had a positive correlation with co2 fluxes r2 0 76 p 0 01 in winter fig 6c these results suggest that metabolic processes are important controlling factors in restraining co2 fluxes of gjr in winter there are three species of dic i e co2 dissolved co2 and h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 and their relative activities in water are largely functions of ph liu et al 2010 knowledge of the relative contribution of each of these forms to the dic pool is crucial because each form will behave differently under different conditions at a relatively high ph 7 or higher co2 dissociates into the ionized species hco3 and co3 2 and by converting co2 into non volatile forms this carbonate buffering may reduce co2 evasion to the atmosphere cai et al 2008 egleston et al 2010 derived explicit expressions of the revelle factor and several other buffer factors to quantify the carbonate buffering capacity table 3 we can examine the buffer factor changes for gjr by using the co2sys computer program to calculate the carbonate species depending on water temperature ph and alkalinity the results are shown in fig 7 the buffer factor ω dic in winter 0 12 0 08 mmol l increased significantly compared with the increase in summer 0 05 0 03 mmol l especially at ms fig 7c stets et al 2017 believed that the carbonate buffering system imparts additional control on co2 concentrations and is closely related to the alkalinity of surface waters in winter the aquatic metabolic process used up the macronutrients to draw down the dic resulting in low αdic alk ratios and high alkalinity fig 7h therefore the co2 entering the water is ionized to hco3 h and decreases the gradient of co2 across the air water interface thereby limiting co2 evasion and introducing lags into the co2 or dic equilibration times stets et al 2017 looking at it another way a higher ω dic also implies that gjr has a higher ability to take up carbon for a given atmospheric co2 increase and this is also one of the reasons why co2 sinks occur at ms in winter egleston et al 2010 conversely a large amount of soil with a high co2 content enters rivers in summer and the aquatic metabolic process is limited resulting in relatively high î dic alk ratios and low alkalinity therefore most of the changing dics would be expressed as co2 and would equilibrate relatively rapidly with the atmosphere and then result in considerable co2 degassing stets et al 2017 the other five buffering factors γ dic β dic γ alk β alk and ω alk showed an almost coincident change pattern with ω dic fig 7a b d e f in addition the revelle factor showed a significantly positive correlation with co2 degassing in winter fig 6d but not in summer thus indicating that the carbonate buffer played an important role in restraining co2 degassing in winter 4 4 co2 fluxes relative to the world s rivers gjr exhibited mean co2 fluxes of 5 62 5 93 g m2 d in summer and 1 25 4 02 g m2 d in winter then we calculated the co2 efflux using the average co2 fluxes in summer and winter water surface area and the monitoring times undoubtedly our results concluded that gjr was an important net co2 flux from the river to the atmosphere similar to other major rivers in the world table 4 however the co2 flux exhibited significant temporal and spatial variation in gjr especially regarding the co2 sink that appeared at ms from table 4 we can see that the average value of 3 44 5 48 g m2 d in gjr was comparable to the co2 flux in ottawa 3 56 g m 2 d 1 telmer and veizer 1999 but was much lower than the values observed for other subtropical rivers and tropical rivers richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 alin et al 2011 li et al 2012 2013 it is noteworthy that the co2 flux in the gjr basin was even lower than that of some temperate rivers and boreal rivers dubois et al 2010 striegl et al 2012 therefore geological conditions may play a more important role in the co2 flux at regional and watershed scales than the climatic conditions in the gjr basin terrestrially derived carbon in inland water bodies has three main fates being buried in sediments being degassed to the atmosphere or being transported to the ocean battin et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 here we estimate the magnitude of co2 flux and dissolved carbon flux output as shown in table 4 the total amount of co2 degassed to the atmosphere from gjr was estimated to be 0 032 0 047 tg c yr and the calculated total dic fluxes were 0 160 0 075 tg c yr the co2 flux from gjr accounted for 20 1 of the dic flux discharged to the watershed thus this ratio was not only much lower than that of tropical rivers but also lower than that of temperate rivers and boreal rivers including the mississippi and yukon rivers overall our assessment proves that a high carbon sink potential of 0 128 tg c yr is formed due to the carbonate buffer capacity and aquatic photosynthesis in gjr 5 conclusion this study highlights the significant seasonal and spatial variations in co2 fluxes across the water air interfaces in a large karst river the variations are primarily driven by in stream metabolic processes and the carbonate buffer in response to different environmental conditions and the underlying lithology of the watershed the river restrains co2 evasion at ms in winter furthermore the river undergoes co2 fluxes of 0 032 0 047 tg c yr these seasonal and spatial variations in co2 fluxes indicate that significant uncertainty could exist in estimates of global riverine co2 emissions that disregard the high spatiotemporal heterogeneity and the impact of aquatic systems and carbonate buffer systems on the global carbon cycle however our research is only applicable to subtropical rivers as opposed to other climate zones therefore we recommend high spatiotemporal monitoring of co2 fluxes affected by aquatic systems and carbonate buffer systems in different climate zones to minimize uncertainty in the estimates of co2 exchange between rivers and the atmosphere at global scales this evaluation is particularly critical in karst river systems of different climate zones where the river waters are clear stable and highly alkaline which facilitates high primary productivity and the creation of carbonate buffers

6145,the important flux estimate of carbon exchange across the water air interface in river systems of the global carbon cycle are being increasingly recognized however these estimates have large uncertainty due to the incomplete temporal and spatial coverage of co2 flux here we evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics and controlling factors of co2 exchange across the water air interface and their potential role in regional and global carbon budgets in 25 river transects along guijiang river gjr southwestern china in july and december 2016 these river transects were divided into upstream us middle ms and downstream ds reaches in non karst karst and mixed areas respectively the riverine co2 fluxes showed obvious seasonal variations ranging from 5 62 5 93 g m2 d in summer to 1 25 4 02 g m2 d in winter with an average value of 3 44 5 48 g m2 d the riverine co2 fluxes exhibited significant spatial patterns where the highest and lowest averaged co2 fluxes occurred at ms in summer and winter respectively generally the river was a carbon source with respect to the atmosphere throughout the year however the co2 fluxes were obviously restrained by aquatic metabolism and the carbonate buffer system in winter additionally the absorbed co2 at ms was due to strong photosynthetic and carbonate buffer activities carbon loss via atmospheric exchange in the gjr river basin was 0 032 0 047 tg c yr which accounted for 20 1 of the riverine dissolved carbon fluxes 0 160 0 075 tg c yr thus 0 128tg c yr 1 was sequestered in the gjr basin our results demonstrate the need to emphasize the importance of aquatic photosynthesis and the carbonate buffer system in restraining co2 degassing in karst rivers it is important to underscore the detailed spatiotemporal changes in co2 flux to reduce uncertainty in current estimates of global riverine co2 emissions keywords carbon exchange seasonal and spatial variations carbonate buffer aquatic photosynthesis karst river systems 1 introduction rivers play an important role in biogeochemical reactions involving the global carbon cycle by linking terrestrial and marine carbon reservoirs rivers are typically considered to be the fluvial exporters of total organic and inorganic carbon 0 9 0 95 pg c yr from the terrestrial environment to the ocean cole et al 2007 regnier et al 2013 in recent years an evident co2 degassing effect has been found in the river system and the estimated range of co2 evasion flux across the water air interface in global rivers is 0 23 1 8 pg c yr richey et al 2002 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 butman and raymond 2011 aufdenkampe et al 2011 regnier et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 borges et al 2015 however these estimates represent a large uncertainty in the data covering nearly an entire order of magnitude this uncertainty is mainly related to the following three conditions 1 co2 partial pressure pco2 in rivers 2 gas transfer velocity and 3 surface areas of global streams and rivers raymond et al 2013 in particular the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in water has high spatial and temporal heterogeneities due to climatic and geological characteristics which brings great uncertainty to the intensity of co2 flux and co2 sink source across the water air interface in global rivers weyhenmeyer et al 2012 most of the early published pco2 data in surface waters estimates were focus on lakes and estuaries and were approximately many fold higher than the pco2 of the present atmospheric equilibrium cole et al 1994 raymond et al 1997 frankignoulle et al 1998 early direct measurements of large rivers and inland waters in the arctic have also demonstrated that pco2 is supersaturated park et al 1969 kling et al 1992 by evasion of this excess gaseous carbon surface waters can act as conduits for a significant flux of carbon from terrestrial pools to the atmosphere richey et al 2002 cole et al 2007 li et al 2013 pu et al 2017 several studies have been carried out on the temporal and spatial variations of the pco2 value and co2 fluxes in rivers which are controlled by complex biological chemical and physical factors for example yao et al 2007 believe that the pco2 value and co2 fluxes in the xijiang river basin show significant seasonal variation which is affected by in situ biological activities and rainfall processes peter et al 2014 also found significant seasonal diurnal and event driven changes in the pco2 value and co2 fluxes in alpine streams in short temporal changes mainly include seasonal variations diurnal variations individual events and interannual variations due to the climate aquatic respiration photosynthesis hydrologic dynamics and human activities hope et al 2004 yao et al 2007 wang et al 2007 koprivnjak et al 2010 lynch et al 2010 peter et al 2014 almeida et al 2017 pu et al 2017 2019 zhang et al 2017 in addition the spatial variations of pco2 values and co2 fluxes in rivers at global regional and watershed scales are controlled by the climate and geological conditions richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 aufdenkampe et al 2011 for example pco2 is usually higher in the lower reaches of the river for large rivers telmer and veizer 1999 hellings et al 2001 especially in estuaries frankignoulle et al 1998 raymond et al 2000 however for streams pco2 commonly declines from headwaters to downstream reaches as connectivity between streams and their catchments declines jones and mulholland 1998 studies have shown that co2 evasion from surface waters has been restrained in recent years including a decline in co2 degassing and an increase in co2 sinks due to the photosynthesis carbonate dissolution carbon sources and carbonate buffer capacity in rivers for example liu et al 2015 found that atmospheric co2 was taken up at noon at a rate as high as 3600 mg m2 h in the middle reaches of a karst pool in maolan due to the metabolic processes of aquatic plants similarly a significant co2 sink was proved for seasonal and diurnal scales in the two typical transects of the main stream of guijiang river due to carbonate dissolution and high primary productivity zhang et al 2017 in addition using data from 21 603 sites of the continental river monitoring network of the united states stets et al 2017 revealed that rivers with a high alkalinity content restrained the co2 degassing flux due to the influence of the carbonate buffer system the co2 fluxes could also be limited in carbonate dominated regions when compared to silicate terrains due to the different carbon sources khadka et al 2014 in summary the co2 sink source across the water air interface of rivers is not absolute undoubtedly significant spatiotemporal differences in the co2 flux intensity and co2 sink source effect lead to great uncertainty in the regional and global carbon budgets and cycles thus it is important to assess spatiotemporal changes in co2 flux intensity and co2 sink source across the water air interface in rivers so that we can obtain better insights into constraints on regional and global carbon budgets and cycles due to the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of co2 flux in terms of intensity and direction there is considerable uncertainty in the regional and global assessment of co2 flux and its control mechanisms moreover we are still unclear about the high spatiotemporal variation in restraining co2 degassing and its control mechanism to increase the constraints on riverine co2 flux intensity and the co2 sink source we measured the seasonal and spatial concentrations of river water chemistry and co2 fluxes across the water air interface in a subtropical karst river guijiang river gjr located in southwestern china we used these data to assess the seasonal and spatial dynamics of co2 and their potential role in regional and global carbon budgets we estimated the magnitude and direction of co2 fluxes at different spatiotemporal scales using time series physico chemical data isotope data and co2 flux data employing the floating chamber fc and the thin boundary layer tbl methods our observations indicate that seasonal and spatial co2 flux estimates must be considered in regional and global estimates of riverine co2 fluxes to minimize uncertainty in the estimates especially in restraining co2 degassing 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the guijiang river which forms a tributary of the pearl river originates from maoershan mountainat an elevation of 2142 m fig 1 the river is 438 km long and drains an area of 18790 km2 the average river gradient runoff depth and annual runoff are 0 43 1033 mm and 1 44 1010 m3 yr respectively the regional climate is dominated by the east asian monsoon which is characterized by a cold dry winter from late november through march and a hot rainy summer from april through october the annual average temperature is about 20 c in the gjr catchment from south to north and has significant spatial differences for example the annual average temperature in wuzhou city near the lower reaches is 21 c but in guilin in the middle reach it is only 18 c zhang 2013 as shown in fig 1 we chose 25 monitoring sites of the river and divided them into three parts based on rock types in the gjr catchment the upper reach with primary distribution of silurian granites ordovician cambrian shales and mud rocks intercalated with carbonate rocks us non

electrical conductivity spc were measured in situ at all 25 sites using a multi parameter meter ysi pro dss yellows springs ohio usa in july and december 2016 prior to each measurement the instrument

the photosynthetically active radiation par was calculated by multiplying the light values by the conversion coefficient 0 0185 in the 400 700 nm lightwave range 2 3 discrete sample collection and analysis discrete river waters were sampled at all 25 sites using syringes each sample was immediately filtered through 0 45 μm filter membranes and collected in pre rinsed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles 500 ml for major ion analyses samples for cations were acidified to ph 2 with hno3 samples used for the stable carbon isotope of dissolved inorganic carbon δ 13cdic analysis were filtered into 15 ml hdpe bottles through 0 22 µm acetate rayon filters these samples were immediately preserved using three drops of a saturated solution of hgcl2 to prevent microbial alteration all of the samples were stored in an ice box until delivery to the laboratory where they were kept chilled in a refrigerator at 4 c until analysis alkalinity was determined using hcl titration with a titrette

following a modified method of atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 the results were calibrated by the international standard vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb all of the laboratory analyses were carried out in the environmental and geochemical analysis laboratory at the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological science the hydrochemical datasets including ph water temperature and concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 were processed with the program watspec wigley 1977 to calculate the partial pressure of co2 pco2 and saturation index of calcite sic in river water the dic including species hco3 co3 2 co2aq and total dic was calculated by the co2sys procedure using the alkalinity and ph pierrot et al 2006 2 4 co2 fluxes across the water air interface 2 4 1 thin

channels 100 m wide different equations are available for large and small rivers because the gjr s width is usually greater than 100 m throughout the year we estimated k 600 using the large rivers

chamber fc method the floating chamber is an inexpensive and convenient method to measure direct diffusive fluxes at the surface of aquatic ecosystems to measure co2 concentration we used an egm 5 pp systems usa in conjunction with a floating chamber designed independently for on line monitoring the floating chamber was a stainless steel cylinder with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 40 cm the volume of air trapped inside the chamber was 28 3 l the interior walls of the chamber were laminated with a heat insulating material to prevent overheating due to direct sunlight and a small fan was equipped inside the chamber to homogenize the gas a vent on the top of the chamber equilibrated the pressure inside the chamber with the atmospheric pressure prior to each measurement liu et al 2014 the chamber was connected to the egm 5 with tygon tubing in a closed loop and air was circulated using the egm 5 s internal pump the air coming from the chamber was passed through a desiccant to prevent water condensation in the tubing the initial increase in pco2 in the chamber was plotted against time and the slope of the increase found by linear regression analysis was used to estimate the

values than those obtained by the fc about 1 3 and 1 8 times respectively those obtained by the fc in addition the results of the two methods in the co2 sink source were relatively consistent and only three co2 fluxes showed inconsistencies in the co2 sink source table 1 the absolute value of the ratio α in co2 fluxes between tbl and fc was 0 08 19 62 the average value was 2 77 and the median value was 1 41 the α values were relatively concentrated in the range of 0 2 in which the values less than 1 account for 38 7 of all values and values between 1 and 2 accounted for 22 5 fig 2 as shown in fig 3 the distributions obtained by the two methods were basically the same and the degree of dispersion was not that different in addition the results obtained by the two methods showed good positive correlation r 0 49 p 0 05 indicating that the two methods differed only slightly in the monitoring of the guijiang river basin this verified the accuracy of the two methods the results of the tbl were more complete had a larger range of changes and could better reflect the spatial and temporal differences of guijiang river basin therefore we used co2 fluxes estimated from the tbl method for further discussion in this study and the values from the fc are presented only for comparison 3 results 3 1 physicochemical and hydrological parameters the physicochemical and hydrological statistics of the monitored transections are listed in table 2 the tair do and par showed significant seasonal and spatial differences p 0 001 as expected air temperature tair decreased from 35 1 c 2 6 c in summer to

the par varied from 675 3 403 9 μmol m2 s in winter to 1001 1 598 1 μmol m2 s in summer spatial par averages increased along the flow direction in both summer and winter low velocities were observed in both summer and winter with an average 0 26 0 30 m s in summer and 0 11 0 16 m s in winter similar k600 averages 9 9 4 7 cm h in summer and 11 0 7 3 cm h in winter were observed across the seasons which coincided with the observations of seasonal flow velocity both flow velocity and k600 showed no significant seasonal differences p 0 05 3 2 dic species statistically significant differences in dic species including water temperature ph co3 2 and dissolved co2 t test p 0 001 occurred across seasons and river sections fig 4 as expected a higher average water temperature twater occurred in summer 28 1 c 1 7 c about 1 7 fold that observed in winter 16 7 c 1 5 c ph varied from 7 07 to 9 05 over time and across the watershed on average the maximum ph value of 8 40 0 42 and the minimum value of 7 17 0 08 were observed at ms in winter and at us in summer respectively fig 4b the same seasonal and spatial variations occurred for alkalinity dic and co3 2 fig 4c e dissolved co2 averaged 28 0 16 6 μmol l in summer and 8 6 10 2 μmol l in winter with both the maximum value 32 3 19 2 μmol l and minimum value 8 4 12 4 μmol l at ms fig 4f hco3 was considered the dominant component of dic and averaged 1028 8 522 7 μmol l in summer and 1149 5 547 3 μmol l in winter accounting for 95 3 and 91 0 respectively of dic on average fig 4e 3 3 spatial and temporal variability of pco2 the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 in gjr displayed pronounced temporal variations table 2 on average the pco2 levels were significantly higher in summer 1944 3 1158 6 μatm than in winter 650 9 691 5 μatm about three times greater t test p 0 01 the average pco2 value in surface water was 1297 6 1148 2 μatm in gjr table 2 the pco2 in the guijiang river exhibited diverse spatial patterns fig 4g the pco2 levels ranged from 575 4 μatm to 6166 0 μatm in summer and from 38 9 μatm to 3162 3 μatm in winter t test p 0 01 both the highest 6166 0 μatm and lowest 38 9 μatm pco2 occurred at the ms the spatial average value of pco2 indicated that pco2 first increased from us to ms and then decreased from ms to ds along the flow direction in summer whereas the reverse phenomenon was observed in winter fig 4g the results showed about 78 of samples were supersaturated in co2 compared to the atmospheric co2 equilibrium 3 4 co2 fluxes significant differences in co2 fluxes were found in guijiang river between seasons t test p 0 01 with average values varying from 28 4 91 4 mmol m2 d in winter to 127 8 134 7 mmol m2 d in summer table 2 the average co2 fluxes in summer were significantly higher than those in winter approximately 4 5 times t test p 0 01 the spatial average showed that the largest co2 fluxes occurred at ms 154 6 160 0 mmol m2 d in summer these were much larger than the fluxes at us 95 3 6 1 8 mmol m2 d and ds 68 0 40 6 mmol m2 d however co2 fluxes declined significantly at ms 30 1 113 3 mmol m2 d in winter to be comparable to those at us 31 7 45 9 mmol m2 d and ds 20 3 18 3 mmol m2 d co2 exchange showed a negative flux at ms for some time points in winter appearing as a co2 sink fig 4h 4 discussion 4 1 controls on co2 fluxes the co2 fluxes were affected by complex biological chemical and physical processes including the production and transport of soil co2 in situ respiration and degradation photosynthesis by aquatic plants and co2 transfer velocities richey 2003 yao et al 2007 however the co2 transfer velocities showed no significant seasonal or spatial differences p 0 05 table 3 in gjr thus indicating that other processes were more important than co2 transfer velocities regarding co2 flux changes the pco2 values and co2 fluxes were both significantly higher in summer than in winter in gjr fig 4g h gjr drains a subtropical monsoon area where higher precipitation corresponds to warmer seasons and vice versa therefore significantly higher air temperature 35 1 c 2 6 c vs 21 8 c 4 5 c par 1001 1 598 1 μmol m2 s vs 675 3 403 9 μmol m2 s and more precipitation occurred in summer than in winter table 3 this is conducive to vegetation growth and organic matter degradation and enhances the soil co2 content by co2 respiration more precipitation will flush the soil with a high co2 content into the river water hope et al 2004 li et al 2013 which results in pco2 supersaturation in river waters and increases co2 flux in summer certainly the pco2 will change across seasons or across different stretches of the river by the varying the relative dominance of in situ respiration and the degradation of organic matter versus photosynthesis yao et al 2007 this then makes the co2 flux rise or fall the do saturation had strong negative correlations with pco2 in winter r2 0 86 p 0 01 but not in summer r2 0 03 which reflects biogenic activities in the water of gjr in winter in addition the mean do saturation in summer was significantly lower than that in winter 99 7 7 8 vs 111 1 21 1 it was under saturated in summer and oversaturated in winter thus indicating that more intense photosynthesis occurred in winter the degree of photosynthesis and respiration in the sub aquatic community in the river is mainly controlled by seasonal and spatial changes in winter temperature turbulence and flow velocity barth and veizer 1999 the turbidity and flow velocity in summer were much higher than those in winter mean 17 6 8 7 ntu vs 2 2 2 0 ntu in turbidity and mean 0 26 0 30 m s vs 0 11 0 16 m s in flow velocity which possibly restrain the intensity of photosynthesis due to a greater disturbance in summer table 3 barth and veizer 1999 on the contrary a relatively high water temperature in a subtropical winter with lower turbidity and flow velocity is more conducive to the photosynthesis of aquatic plants meybeck 1993 ludwig et al 1996 which makes pco2 lower in winter and reduces the co2 flux according to the above discussions significant biological activities occurred in winter but not in summer in summer the mean do saturation at ms 97 2 8 3 was lower than that at us 103 9 3 4 and ds 104 5 5 5 and was under saturated table 3 therefore less co2 was consumed during photosynthesis in the sub aquatic community leading to the largest mean co2 evasion flux appearing at ms in winter the mean do saturation at ms 115 7 24 7 was higher than that at us 101 3 11 2 and showed oversaturation thus indicating that more intense photosynthesis occurred at ms therefore a significant co2 sink appeared at ms in addition the catchment lithology could be an important controlling factor of riverine co2 martin 2017 pu et al 2017 for example the co2 evasion fluxes could be limited in the carbonate dominated regions compared to silicate terrains khadka et al 2014 however the co2 evasion fluxes at ms were lower than those at us in winter but were much higher in summer this implies that different rock characteristics and water environments could affect pco2 and co2 flux variations by changing the input or output of co2 sources and variation of carbon at different spatial and temporal scales yao et al 2007 4 2 sources and variations of riverine dic the major carbon sources of dic in rivers are 1 atmospheric co2 2 respired soil co2 and 3 co2 derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals the c isotope values of dic with potential biological sources atmospheric sources and geological sources can be used to reveal the relative contributions from each source telmer and veizer 1999 brunet et al 2005 khadka et al 2014 generally atmospheric co2 is inconsequential or secondary telmer and veizer 1999 which is consistent with the fact that gjr mainly exhibits co2 degassing the dissolution of carbonate minerals is controlled by the hydrolysis of dissolved co2 generally half or more of the dic may originate from carbonate minerals depending on the amount of dissolution telmer and veizer 1999 the isotopic value of the combined dic should be around 12 depending on the relative amounts of mineral dissolution and dissolved co2 and the isotopic composition mook and de vries 2000 doctor et al 2008 khadka et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 a relatively high δ 13cdic values were clustered above the level of 12 indicating that carbonate rocks are a significant source in gjr fig 5a shows the changing trend of dic and δ 13cdic values in gjr basin the spatial distribution of dic and δ 13cdic values in gjr is strongly controlled by geology on average the dic concentrations and δ 13cdic values at ms were higher than that those at us and ds in both summer and winter in addition more carbonate rock dissolution may cause higher δ 13cdic values given the positive correlation r2 0 49 p 0 001 between δ 13cdic values and sic in gjr fig 5b the downstream increase in δ 13cdic values from the us in both summer and winter coupled with a sharp growth in sic table 2 suggests a significant influence of carbonate dissolution at ms which is consistent with the main distribution of carbonate rocks in the middle reaches in addition the δ 13cdic values were also affected by several biogeochemical processes in the channel including biological processes photosynthesis and respiration of sub aquatic community and carbonate mineral precipitation photosynthesis should increase both the δ 13cdic values and do concentrations since aquatic plants preferentially incorporate 12c and release o2 khadka et al 2014 photosynthesis would affect the river δ 13cdic values due to the significant positive correlation r2 0 50 p 0 001 between the δ 13cdic value and do saturation in winter fig 5c in addition calcite precipitation would produce only an approximately 0 5 to 1 depletion in 13c in the residual dic under equilibrium conditions however the δ 13cdic values increased from the us to ms in both summer and winter these results indicated that calcite precipitation should affect δ 13cdic values only slightly in a short compared with summer the higher δ 13cdic values in winter were affected by higher carbonate rock dissolution and photosynthesis in addition the carbonate rocks were the major carbon sources at ms in both summer and winter however the co2 fluxes showed a significant decline in winter at ms and a co2 sink appeared therefore some processes within rivers may play a more important role than the carbon sources in limiting co2 evasion such as the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and carbonate dissolution khadka et al 2014 pu et al 2017 4 3 processes restraining co2 evasion this study measured a total average co2 flux of 127 8 mmol m2 d over all of the sampling sites with a maximum value of 266 5 mmol m2 d at gjr site 16 in summer in winter we measured a total average co2 flux of 28 4 mmol m2 d over all sampling sites with minimum value of 45 8 mmol m2 d at gjr site 5 a significant decreasing trend from summer to winter in co2 fluxes was found in gjr the maximum decrease in co2 fluxes occurred at ms with the average values varying from 154 6 160 0 mmol m2 d in summer to 30 1 113 3 mmol m2 d in winter table 2 in short significant co2 degassing fluxes were limited in gjr in winter especially at ms where the co2 sink appeared both do and co2 concentrations are controlled directly by photosynthesis and respiration of sub aquatic plants algae and microbes the changes in pco2 also alter ph values doctor et al 2008 do saturation had a strong negative correlation with pco2 r2 0 82 p 0 01 and a strong positive correlation with ph in winter fig 6 a b which reflects the control of photosynthesis and respiration of the sub aquatic community on do and pco2 the correlation between pco2 and ph indicates that the hydration of co2 is the primary acid source in the system photosynthesis induced decreases in pco2 also restrain co2 fluxes by decreasing the gradient between the dissolved co2 and atmospheric pco2 carpenter et al 2001 pu et al 2017 as mentioned above the relatively high water temperature slow water flow low turbulence and high residence time during this period might provide a favorable environment for microbial activities in winter table 2 meybeck 1993 ludwig et al 1996 in addition the pco2 had a positive correlation with co2 fluxes r2 0 76 p 0 01 in winter fig 6c these results suggest that metabolic processes are important controlling factors in restraining co2 fluxes of gjr in winter there are three species of dic i e co2 dissolved co2 and h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 and their relative activities in water are largely functions of ph liu et al 2010 knowledge of the relative contribution of each of these forms to the dic pool is crucial because each form will behave differently under different conditions at a relatively high ph 7 or higher co2 dissociates into the ionized species hco3 and co3 2 and by converting co2 into non volatile forms this carbonate buffering may reduce co2 evasion to the atmosphere cai et al 2008 egleston et al 2010 derived explicit expressions of the revelle factor and several other buffer factors to quantify the carbonate buffering capacity table 3 we can examine the buffer factor changes for gjr by using the co2sys computer program to calculate the carbonate species depending on water temperature ph and alkalinity the results are shown in fig 7 the buffer factor ω dic in winter 0 12 0 08 mmol l increased significantly compared with the increase in summer 0 05 0 03 mmol l especially at ms fig 7c stets et al 2017 believed that the carbonate buffering system imparts additional control on co2 concentrations and is closely related to the alkalinity of surface waters in winter the aquatic metabolic process used up the macronutrients to draw down the dic resulting in low αdic alk ratios and high alkalinity fig 7h therefore the co2 entering the water is ionized to hco3 h and decreases the gradient of co2 across the air water interface thereby limiting co2 evasion and introducing lags into the co2 or dic equilibration times stets et al 2017 looking at it another way a higher ω dic also implies that gjr has a higher ability to take up carbon for a given atmospheric co2 increase and this is also one of the reasons why co2 sinks occur at ms in winter egleston et al 2010 conversely a large amount of soil with a high co2 content enters rivers in summer and the aquatic metabolic process is limited resulting in relatively high î dic alk ratios and low alkalinity therefore most of the changing dics would be expressed as co2 and would equilibrate relatively rapidly with the atmosphere and then result in considerable co2 degassing stets et al 2017 the other five buffering factors γ dic β dic γ alk β alk and ω alk showed an almost coincident change pattern with ω dic fig 7a b d e f in addition the revelle factor showed a significantly positive correlation with co2 degassing in winter fig 6d but not in summer thus indicating that the carbonate buffer played an important role in restraining co2 degassing in winter 4 4 co2 fluxes relative to the world s rivers gjr exhibited mean co2 fluxes of 5 62 5 93 g m2 d in summer and 1 25 4 02 g m2 d in winter then we calculated the co2 efflux using the average co2 fluxes in summer and winter water surface area and the monitoring times undoubtedly our results concluded that gjr was an important net co2 flux from the river to the atmosphere similar to other major rivers in the world table 4 however the co2 flux exhibited significant temporal and spatial variation in gjr especially regarding the co2 sink that appeared at ms from table 4 we can see that the average value of 3 44 5 48 g m2 d in gjr was comparable to the co2 flux in ottawa 3 56 g m 2 d 1 telmer and veizer 1999 but was much lower than the values observed for other subtropical rivers and tropical rivers richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 alin et al 2011 li et al 2012 2013 it is noteworthy that the co2 flux in the gjr basin was even lower than that of some temperate rivers and boreal rivers dubois et al 2010 striegl et al 2012 therefore geological conditions may play a more important role in the co2 flux at regional and watershed scales than the climatic conditions in the gjr basin terrestrially derived carbon in inland water bodies has three main fates being buried in sediments being degassed to the atmosphere or being transported to the ocean battin et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 here we estimate the magnitude of co2 flux and dissolved carbon flux output as shown in table 4 the total amount of co2 degassed to the atmosphere from gjr was estimated to be 0 032 0 047 tg c yr and the calculated total dic fluxes were 0 160 0 075 tg c yr the co2 flux from gjr accounted for 20 1 of the dic flux discharged to the watershed thus this ratio was not only much lower than that of tropical rivers but also lower than that of temperate rivers and boreal rivers including the mississippi and yukon rivers overall our assessment proves that a high carbon sink potential of 0 128 tg c yr is formed due to the carbonate buffer capacity and aquatic photosynthesis in gjr 5 conclusion this study highlights the significant seasonal and spatial variations in co2 fluxes across the water air interfaces in a large karst river the variations are primarily driven by in stream metabolic processes and the carbonate buffer in response to different environmental conditions and the underlying lithology of the watershed the river restrains co2 evasion at ms in winter furthermore the river undergoes co2 fluxes of 0 032 0 047 tg c yr these seasonal and spatial variations in co2 fluxes indicate that significant uncertainty could exist in estimates of global riverine co2 emissions that disregard the high spatiotemporal heterogeneity and the impact of aquatic systems and carbonate buffer systems on the global carbon cycle however our research is only applicable to subtropical rivers as opposed to other climate zones therefore we recommend high spatiotemporal monitoring of co2 fluxes affected by aquatic systems and carbonate buffer systems in different climate zones to minimize uncertainty in the estimates of co2 exchange between rivers and the atmosphere at global scales this evaluation is particularly critical in karst river systems of different climate zones where the river waters are clear stable and highly alkaline which facilitates high primary productivity and the creation of carbonate buffers

6146,eutrophication and subsequent harmful cyanobacteria blooms are global water quality problems and identifying the key drivers of water eutrophication and estimating nutrient thresholds for it in waterbodies have long been challenges for water quality managers data intensive machine learning models have been shown to be better able to reveal the nonlinear relationships between variables in the study of complex biotic community dynamics than traditional mechanistic models in this study we applied random forest models to long term datasets from nutrient monitoring and meteorological observations to characterize the relationships between algal growth and different environmental drivers in three eutrophic lakes in china we further attempted to estimate the season specific nutrient thresholds in these lakes and assess the potential decreases in chlorophyll a concentrations that could be achieved through nutrient management in general chlorophyll a concentrations predicted by the random forest models were consistent with the values observed in the lakes and successfully displayed the same seasonal variations the estimated total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp nutrient thresholds were quite variable among months and were higher in summer than in winter to maintain chlorophyll a concentrations below 20 μg l the estimated tn thresholds in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu in august were 2145 683 2372 918 and 1527 71 μg l mean standard deviation respectively and the corresponding tp thresholds were 82 24 149 22 and 120 22 μg l the modelling results indicated that it was more important to control the tp concentrations in these lakes than the tn concentrations to control algal growth in summer in summary the strong seasonal variation in the estimated nutrient thresholds suggests that a one size fits all nutrient control target could overprotect these water bodies seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations and environmental drivers should thus be considered when establishing nutrient criteria and setting nutrient control targets keywords nutrient thresholds random forest models season specific nutrient management lake eutrophication 1 introduction eutrophication and subsequent harmful algal blooms habs have become global water quality problems in recent decades conley et al 2009 glibert 2017 huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a habs are usually toxic to humans and other animals can disrupt aquatic food webs and result in hypoxia and loss of biodiversity peñuelas et al 2013 posch et al 2012 van de waal et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 in china the majority of lakes are rather shallow and have become or have been becoming eutrophic since the early 2000s le et al 2010 eutrophication is primarily attributed to intensified anthropogenic nitrogen n and phosphorus p discharges into freshwater ecosystems huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a tong et al 2017a b tong et al 2018 however the relative importance of n and p in the control of eutrophication remains a subject that is intensely debated i e the p only paradigm carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2016 versus the p n paradigm lewis et al 2011 paerl et al 2016b p has traditionally been considered the limiting nutrient for algal growth based on experimental manipulations of lakes in several previous studies schindler et al 2016 and a p only control strategy has been successful in mitigating eutrophication in some lakes lewis et al 2011 however increasing numbers of whole lake experiments have reported that habs are stimulated by combined p and n enrichment rather than by enrichment with n or p alone paerl et al 2016b 2011 besides nutrient enrichment non manageable environmental factors such as lake warming solar radiation and wind speed are also believed to be important in explaining the occurrences of habs huisman et al 2018 lake warming could promote algal growth alter algal composition and increase the concentrations of toxin produced by microcystis spp and planktothrix spp davis et al 2009 paerl et al 2016a reduced water turnover caused by lake warming could be beneficial for buoyant cyanobacteria by allowing them to float upwards posch et al 2012 despite continuous efforts to explore the relationships between the growth of algae and such environment variables our current understanding of these relationships is still unclear and inadequate robson 2014 shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 several strategies e g nutrient discharge control increased flushing chemical treatment sediment dredging and aquatic food web manipulation have been developed to mitigate water eutrophication and control the occurrences of habs huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a reduction to the external nutrient discharges into water bodies is believed to ultimately be the most effective control measure as it addresses the root cause of the problem huisman et al 2018 tong et al 2017b yu et al 2019 before setting a target for nutrient discharge control establishing accurate nutrient thresholds for defining eutrophication in particular water bodies is crucial huo et al 2018 due to the huge geographical differences that occur among watersheds e g differences in climate and land use types and lakes e g with different lake depth and hydrology ecoregion specific criteria have been developed to protect water quality by assuming that lakes in the same ecoregion are affected by the same environmental drivers cardoso et al 2007 poikāne et al 2010 richardson et al 2018 this strategy can make full use of the nutrient monitoring data collected in different lakes and provides an opportunity for nutrient thresholds to be established for lakes without long term monitoring data huo et al 2019 liu et al 2018 however recent studies have revealed that nutrient thresholds in lakes could be lake specific and thus region specific nutrient criteria may fail to reflect the natural variations among lakes liu et al 2019 olson and hawkins 2013 richardson et al 2018 rigosi et al 2014 taranu et al 2012 neglecting such background variations could underprotect water bodies with naturally low nutrient concentrations but overprotect those with naturally high nutrient concentrations olson and hawkins 2013 many studies have also acknowledged the importance of seasonal patterns in environment variables e g water temperature nutrient concentrations and solar radiation to algal growth huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a posch et al 2012 however studies have only rarely addressed the variations in the nutrient thresholds of lakes among different seasons or months establishing nutrient thresholds or criteria for lakes has long been a challenge for water quality managers huo et al 2018 because nutrients are not toxic to aquatic animals at low concentrations nutrient criteria cannot be derived based on the does response relationship used to define threshold levels for toxic pollutants epa 2010 the united states of america us was the first country to establish nutrient criteria for waterbodies epa 2000a huo et al 2018 in 2010 three typical methods were recommended by the us environmental protection agency epa to determine the nutrient criteria for particular lakes which include the reference condition approach mechanistic models and stressor response model epa 2000b epa 2010 in china official technical guidelines for deriving the nutrient criteria for lakes were not issued until 2017 ministry of ecology and environment china 2019 among the methods to establish nutrient criteria the stressor response model which describes the most important known relationships between primary productivity and nutrient concentrations has been the most widely applied in previous studies huo et al 2019 2018 liu et al 2018 the chlorophyll a concentration in a body of water is a water quality index that is closely related to the growth of algae liu et al 2019 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2015 and is thus usually used as a response variable when establishing nutrient thresholds due to the complicated and sometimes unknown mechanisms involved in algal growth the capacity of mechanistic water quality modelling to simulate the dynamics of algae that vary over time remains relatively limited nelson et al 2018 robson 2014 shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 to study such components of complex biotic community dynamics as the nonlinear and unclear relationships between algal growth and major environmental factors data intensive machine learning models e g random forest models artificial neural networks support vector machines etc are among the most rigorous tools available chou et al 2018 garcía nieto et al 2019 liu et al 2019 park et al 2015 these data intensive machine learning models can achieve even better performance in the simulation of algal growth in lakes than that achieved by traditional mechanistic models liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2018 nelson et al 2018 applied random forest models to quantify the nature of the relationships between different environmental conditions and five dominant cyanobacterial genera and estimated the critical nutrient thresholds for different cyanobacterial species liu et al 2019 applied random forest and generalized additive models to assess the predictability of the chlorophyll a concentration in a reservoir and estimate the relative importance of water temperature in driving algal growth many similar studies have demonstrated that machine learning methods could effectively simulate algal growth and develop the site specific nutrient thresholds béjaoui et al 2018 chou et al 2018 park et al 2015 shen et al 2019 the primary goal of this study was to reveal the potential variations in nutrient thresholds in typical eutrophic lakes among different seasons and assess the potential responses of algal growth to nutrient control methods through the use of machine learning models using long term and unified monitoring datasets composed of the monthly nutrient monitoring data and meteorological observations collected from 2006 to 2017 from multiple sampling sites in three eutrophic lakes lake taihu lake dianchi and lake chaohu in china we applied random forest models to simulate the seasonal algal growth estimate the critical nutrient thresholds and assess the potential responses of algal growth to different nutrient control strategies in each lake the results obtained could offer new insights into how flexible and season specific nutrient thresholds can be set in eutrophic lakes while accounting for the natural variations in environmental variables which is crucial for water quality management and reducing the risks of harmful algal blooms in the long term 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake descriptions three typical eutrophic freshwater lakes in china including lake taihu lake chaohu and lake dianchi were selected for examination in this study fig s1 these lakes have received much attention from water quality managers in china since the early 2000s because of their serious eutrophication and frequent occurrences of habs in them ministry of ecology and environment china 2012 lake taihu 31 41 n 120 14 e is located in the southeastern part of the yangtze river basin fig s1 it is a large and shallow lake with an area of 2340 km2 an average depth of 2 2 m and a water volume of 4 4 billion m3 xu et al 2015 in lake taihu the most damaging and extensive outbreak of habs occurred in 2007 which severely affected the water supply of wuxi city and left over two million people without drinking waters for several weeks stone 2011 lake dianchi 25 01 n 102 66 e is the largest plateau lake in a traditional phosphate ore mining region of china with an area of 309 km2 an average depth of 5 0 m and a water volume of 1 56 billion m3 wu et al 2017 lake chaohu 31 56 n 117 38 e is the fifth largest freshwater lake in the lower yangtze river basin in china with an area of 768 km2 an average depth of 2 7 m and a water volume of 20 7 billion m3 huang et al 2018 2 2 long term nutrient monitoring and meteorological observational dataset the data examined in this study consisted of monthly water quality data including the chlorophyll a μg l total nitrogen tn μg l total phosphorus tp μg l and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n μg l concentrations and secchi depth sd cm in each lake and monthly meteorological observations including daily water temperature c precipitation mm day wind speed m s and sunshine duration h day data from january 2006 to december 2017 similarly to previous studies chou et al 2018 huo et al 2019 2018 liu et al 2019 we used the chlorophyll a concentration as a proxy for the algal growth in the lakes although some other variables could also impact algal growth to the best of our knowledge the selected factors examined here included the major potential drivers of algal growth huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a and these variables were also consistently measured with the same standardized methods throughout the study period in each lake water quality monitoring was carried out at multiple sampling sites 17 sampling sites in lake taihu 10 in lake dianchi and 7 in lake chaohu and the detailed distribution of detailed sampling sites in each lake was shown in fig s1 meteorological information was collected from the national meteorological station operated by the china meteorological administration near the lakes http data cma cn the procedures for collecting water samples and measuring nutrient concentrations were consistent throughout the whole study period and were based on the technical specifications requirements for monitoring of surface water and wastewater in china hjt 91 2002 water samples were collected at a depth of about 0 5 m below the water surface the tn concentration was determined by persulfate digestion followed by automated colorimetric analysis n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride spectrophotometry with a method detection limit mdl of 50 μg l the tp concentration was determined by persulfate digestion followed by automated colorimetric analysis ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate under acidic conditions with an mdl of 10 μg l chlorophyll a concentrations were determined by acetone extraction followed by separation by centrifugation separation and the determination of sample absorbance with an mdl of 1 μg l all nutrient concentrations lower than the mdl were set to 1 2 of the mdl in subsequent data analyses the monthly averaged meteorological data were calculated based on the daily observations in summary the complete raw dataset comprised a total of 5726 chlorophyll a concentrations 2800 for lake taihu 1430 for lake dianchi and 1496 for lake chaohu 5768 tn concentrations 2843 for lake taihu 1429 for lake dianchi and 1496 for lake chaohu and 5768 tp concentrations 2843 for lake taihu 1429 for lake dianchi and 1496 for lake chaohu a summary of the monitoring data collected during the study period in the three lakes is provided in table 1 2 3 random forest models we applied random forest models a typical machine learning method relying on the input of large dataset liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2018 to the nutrient monitoring and meteorological observational dataset to characterize the relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and different environment variables the input variables in the model include nutrient monitoring data chlorophyll a tn tp nh4 n and sd and meteorological data water temperature precipitation wind speed and sunshine duration in each lake fig 1 the random forest model is a machine learning algorithm that is used to fit a large ensemble of randomly assembled decorrelated classification or regression trees to bootstrapped samples of a response variable which then averages the outputs of these trees to produce a simulated response nelson et al 2018 the random forest model was previously shown to be good at handling data containing the complicated interactions and at uncovering the nonlinear and linear relationship structures within such datasets it has been successfully applied in simulating seasonal algal growth in previous studies liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2018 in this study a random forest model was developed by using the randomforest package in r 3 2 3 and spss modeler 18 0 ibm usa models were performed by the following steps 1 the historical dataset for each lake during 2006 2016 was portioned into training and testing folds with 90 of the dataset randomly selected as the training fold that was used to build the random forest model 2 the random forests were grown through calculations in r or spss modeler and the models performance was assessed using the testing fold 3 the models performance was validated by predicting monthly chlorophyll a concentrations in 2017 and comparing these to observed values steps 1 3 were repeated for nine times with each new fold representing the testing set in each iteration and 4 the partial dependence of all of the explanatory variables was calculated the post training model was used to estimate the seasonal nutrient thresholds targeted at different chlorophyll a concentrations e g 10 20 μg l and so on and assess the potential responses of chlorophyll a concentrations to different nutrient control strategies or water temperatures when estimating response of chlorophyll a concentrations to reductions of nutrient concentrations in each lake three scenarios were assumed 10 reduction in tn or tp concentration 20 reduction in tn or tp concentration and 50 reduction in tn or tp concentration relative to the monthly monitoring data in 2017 three scenarios with different water temperatures were assumed 10 increase 20 increase and 50 increase relative to the monthly monitoring data in 2017 fig 1 the models performance was quantified using the coefficient of determination r2 calculated between the predicted and observed chlorophyll a concentrations partial dependence values in the random forest models were also calculated by r 3 2 3 as a measure of each explanatory variable s influence on the response variable given the effects of all the other explanatory variables in the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of long term nutrient monitoring results fig 2 shows the monthly changes in chlorophyll a tn and tp concentrations from 2006 to 2017 in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu among these three lakes lake dianchi had the highest chlorophyll a tn and tp concentrations in 2017 chlorophyll a tn and tp concentrations mean standard deviation in lake dianchi were 86 85 2226 895 and 137 69 μg l respectively which were all much higher than the corresponding values recorded in lake taihu and lake chaohu the tn and tp concentrations in lake dianchi were also much higher than the grade iii limit for water quality that is usually used as a standard for clean lakes in china which is defined as a tn concentration of 1000 μg l and a tp concentration of 50 μg l ministry of ecology and environment china 2002 in lake taihu and lake chaohu the chlorophyll a concentrations in 2017 were 18 32 and 11 14 μg l mean standard deviation respectively and their tn and tp concentrations approached or were slightly higher than the grade iii limits for lakes in china during the study period the tp concentration declined significantly in all three lakes while the tn concentration was only observed to have declined in lake taihu and lake dianchi in response to these changes in tn and tp concentrations chlorophyll a concentrations gradually declined in lake taihu and lake chaohu from the year 2006 onward with a monthly decrease of 0 11 μg l in lake taihu p 0 01 n 144 and of 0 14 μg l in lake chaohu p 0 01 n 144 while no significant decline in chlorophyll a concentration was observed in lake dianchi p 0 1 n 143 clear seasonal patterns in chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations were observed in all three lakes fig 1 for instance in lake taihu lower tn concentrations usually occurred in summer and higher tn concentrations usually occurred in spring possibly due to changes in internal nutrient cycling finlay et al 2013 tong et al 2019 zhong et al 2010 in 2017 the tn concentration in july 1118 461 μg l mean standard deviation in lake taihu was even 50 of the tn concentration in this same lake in april 2640 1020 μg l driven by increased water temperatures huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a higher chlorophyll a concentrations usually occurred in summer strong spatial variations in nutrient concentrations were observed among different monitoring sites within the same lake fig s2 significant relationships were observed between the tn or tp concentration and the chlorophyll a concentration p 0 01 indicating that nutrients were important drivers of algal growth tables s1 s3 3 2 performance of random forest models in general the results of modeling by random forests fit the training data very well in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu the r2 values calculated for the relationships between the predicted and observed chlorophyll a concentrations in the training datasets were 0 66 0 04 n 9 0 79 0 03 n 9 and 0 73 0 05 n 9 respectively fig s3 in previous studies carried out using linear regression models lrm or generalized additive models gam r2 coefficient values between predicted and observed chlorophyll a concentrations approaching or above 0 2 were believed to indicate effective prediction by the models huo et al 2018 liu et al 2018 this indicates that the random forest models used herein could simulate algal growth quite successfully the results of the comparison of the cross validated predictions to the testing data are provided in fig 3 a and these results showed that the random forest models made better predictions of chlorophyll a concentrations in lake dianchi r2 0 48 0 37 0 64 n 9 and lake chaohu r2 0 50 0 34 0 68 n 9 than of those in lake taihu r2 0 26 0 12 0 43 n 9 the models were further validated by predicting the monthly chlorophyll a concentration in each lake in 2017 and comparing it to the observed value as shown in fig 3b the predicted results effectively displayed the correct seasonal variation in chlorophyll a concentrations and were quite consistent with the observed concentrations in all three lakes for lake taihu r2 0 27 p 0 01 n 204 for lake dianchi r2 0 38 p 0 01 n 120 and for lake chaohu r2 0 19 p 0 01 n 96 shown in fig s4 3 3 seasonal variations in nutrient thresholds in eutrophic lakes partial dependence plots for the random forest models revealed that the relationships between the response variable and the explanatory variable were predominantly nonlinear and the curves representing these were composed of the average modelled values across the range of observed values of the explanatory variable hastie et al 2009 nelson et al 2018 in this study the steepest curves were associated with the tn concentration tp concentration water temperature and secchi depth measured in the lakes while the nh4 n sunshine duration precipitation and wind speed variables were largely invariant fig 4 in general the chlorophyll a concentration had a relatively stronger partial dependence on the tp concentration in these lakes in particular these curves indicated that there was a threshold in the relationship between the tp concentration and chlorophyll a concentration where the partial dependence rose sharply for tp concentrations between 100 and 350 μg l fig 4 in lake taihu this curve plateaued at tp concentrations greater than about 200 μg l while in lake chaohu and lake dianchi these curves plateaued after about 300 μg l compared with the curves for the tp concentration the curves between the tn concentration and chlorophyll a concentration were less steep particularly in lake dianchi and lake chaohu with a tn concentration of 3000 μg l the chlorophyll a concentration remained stable even as the tn concentrations increased fig 4 this result possibly indicates that algae in different lakes could respond differently to the same changes in nutrient concentrations olson and hawkins 2013 richardson et al 2018 as the water temperature rose the chlorophyll a concentration increased gradually fig 4 in lake dianchi a sudden and steep increase in chlorophyll a concentrations occurred at a water temperature of 25 c while in lake chaohu a steep increase occurred at a water temperature of 30 c suggesting that different algal species could have different sensitivities to increasing water temperatures huisman et al 2018 and that the algae in lake dianchi could grow well at mild temperatures wang et al 2019 by applying the random forest models we estimated the seasonal variations in the tn and tp thresholds in these lakes that were needed to target different chlorophyll a concentration limits when estimating thresholds for one variable we used the monthly monitoring data in these lakes for 2017 as inputs to the models in general the estimated tn and tp thresholds varied significantly among different lakes and different months fig 5 to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to below 20 μg l the estimated monthly tn thresholds in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu were 2180 479 2340 295 and 1849 261 μg l respectively the estimated monthly tp thresholds in these lakes were 66 9 149 28 and 100 22 μg l respectively fig 5 significant variations in nutrient thresholds were also observed among different seasons in lake taihu the tp threshold to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to below 20 μg l was estimated to be 58 12 μg l in may but increased to 82 18 μg l in september in lake chaohu the tn threshold was estimated to be 1472 45 μg l in july but increased to 2438 200 μg l in february the estimated tn and tp thresholds in this study approached the results estimated in a previous study based on bioassay experiments in lake taihu xu et al 2015 which were 1260 μg l for tn and 82 μg l for tp to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to 20 μg l in summer the results of comparing the estimated tn and tp thresholds with the measured results in 2017 showed that the measured tn concentrations approached or were even lower than the estimated thresholds except for those in the spring in lake chaohu however the measured tp concentrations were still much higher than the predicted thresholds in summer fig 5 for instance in lake taihu the measured tp concentration 132 51 μg l in september was much higher than the estimated threshold value 82 18 μg l indicating that the high tp concentrations could possibly be responsible for the high chlorophyll a concentration observed there in summer 3 4 responses of chlorophyll a to changes in nutrients and water temperature quantifying how algal growth responds to declines in the tn and tp concentrations in lakes is of great importance to setting nutrient control targets for water quality management huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2015 by applying the random forest models we estimated the potential declines in chlorophyll a concentrations under scenarios with decreases in tn or tp concentrations of different magnitudes fig 6 shows that the chlorophyll a concentrations in different lakes could have quite different responses to the same decreases in tn and tp concentrations and greater decreases in chlorophyll a concentrations were observed in scenarios with tp declines than in those with tn declines with a decline in the tp concentration but no change in the tn concentration a significant reduction in the chlorophyll a concentration was observed in all three lakes larger declines in chlorophyll a concentration were observed with greater decreases in tp concentrations the largest decrease in chlorophyll a concentration in these scenarios usually occurred in the summer from july to october in all three lakes while only slight changes were observed in spring and winter fig 6a in august the chlorophyll a concentrations in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu were predicted to decline from 50 14 to 39 8 μg l from 175 120 to 140 100 μg l and from 14 18 to 7 1 μg l respectively with a 50 decline in the tp concentration relative to the measured values however in spring and winter the decline in the chlorophyll a concentration in these lakes was usually 10 fig 6a compared with its response to tp concentration the response of the chlorophyll a concentration to decreases in the tn concentration was not significant fig 6b in all three lakes the chlorophyll a concentration was only observed to decline as the tn decreased in lake chaohu in spring while only slight changes were observed in the other seasons and lakes there being different responses of chlorophyll a concentration to nutrient declines in different lakes and seasons revealed the importance of adopting a season specific nutrient management strategy for controlling the growth of algae we further estimated the responses of chlorophyll a concentrations to scenarios in which water temperatures increased and found that the promotion of algal growth by increased water temperature could be quite different in different seasons fig 7 in lake taihu a 20 increase in water temperature was estimated to result in a 16 and 23 increase in the chlorophyll a concentration in march and may respectively while the corresponding increases in chlorophyll a concentration in july and august were 5 indicating that water temperature might not be a limiting factor for algal growth in this lake in summer huisman et al 2018 in lake dianchi the response of chlorophyll a concentrations to increased temperature was less significant throughout the year fig 7 which is consistent with the results presented in fig 4 3 5 implications to future nutrient management in lakes although a full mechanistic understanding of the relationships between algal growth and environment variables remains to be attained liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2018 shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 the simulated chlorophyll a concentrations produced by the random forest models established in this study were fairly robust figs 3 s2 and s3 and demonstrated the importance of establishing lake specific and season specific tn or tp thresholds for the control of algal blooms in lakes fig 5 ecoregion based nutrient criteria provide the possibility of establishing nutrient thresholds for lakes for which long term nutrient monitoring data are not available huo et al 2019 2018 and the variations among individual lakes can then represent historical changes in nutrient concentrations olson and hawkins 2013 region based nutrient criteria have been proposed and applied in previously established regional and national nutrient management strategies for lakes epa 2000a huo et al 2018 and they have proven to be effective in water quality protection in some regions huo et al 2018 however recent studies have revealed that the relative importance of different environmental variables to algal growth could be lake specific and season specific rather than region specific richardson et al 2018 taranu et al 2012 the natural variations among lakes within the same ecoregion could be so large that the adoption of region based nutrient criteria could underprotect waterbodies with naturally low nutrient concentrations and overprotect those with naturally high nutrient concentrations olson and hawkins 2013 for each eutrophic lake selected for use in this study the estimated nutrient thresholds were quite different particularly the tp thresholds fig 5 the estimated tn nutrient thresholds to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to below 20 μg l were 2180 479 μg l for lake taihu 2340 295 μg l for lake dianchi and 1849 261 μg l for lake chaohu in lake dianchi the corresponding tp threshold was estimated to be 149 28 μg l which was much larger than the estimated values for lake taihu 66 9 μg l with a range of 56 82 μg l and lake chaohu 100 22 μg l with a range of 62 126 μg l lake dianchi is located in a traditional phosphate ore mining area in china which thus has a naturally high background tp concentration reaching 100 μg l as early as 1982 ouyang et al 2015 the previously estimated tn and tp criteria for the region wherein lake dianchi was located were estimated to be about 500 μg l and about 20 μg l respectively huo et al 2018 the previously estimated tn and tp criteria for the region wherein lake taihu and lake chaohu were located were about 360 785 μg l and about 14 43 μg l respectively huo et al 2018 because of lack of specific nutrient criteria for many individual lakes the grade iii limits for tn 1000 μg l and tp 50 μg l have also been used as the standards for defining clean lakes in china ministry of ecology and environment china 2002 yu et al 2019 however the estimated tn and tp thresholds for the three lakes in this study were much higher than the region based nutrient criteria and the grade iii limits fig 5 which suggests the possibility that these nutrient criteria might have overprotected the water quality of these lakes besides the nutrient enrichment of lakes huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a water temperature is also believed to be a crucial factor determining the algal growth huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a dimictic lakes usually have a heightened susceptibility to cyanobacterial blooms under stratified eutrophic conditions taranu et al 2012 lake warming may promote the growth of many bloom forming species of cyanobacteria and lead to the more stable stratification of the water column and reduced water turnover posch et al 2012 lake warming could cause changes in algal compositions and further alterations in toxin concentrations posch et al 2012 different algal species in lakes could have different responses to increasing water temperatures and toxic microcystis spp exhibited more significantly elevated growth rates than non toxic species davis et al 2009 cyanobacterial species typically reach their maximum growth rates at water temperatures of approximately 30 c while chlorophytes and dinoflagellates species usually reach their maximum growth rates at about 25 c paerl et al 2016a due to concerns over the negative impacts of algal blooms caused by climate change new nutrient management strategies have been proposed such as setting updated nutrient reduction targets and establishing stricter nutrient criteria for the impacted waterbodies huo et al 2019 liu et al 2018 in this study the analyses of different scenarios carried out using the random forest models showed that the responses of chlorophyll a concentrations to lake warming could differ among different lakes and seasons algal growth was not sensitive to lake warming throughout the year in lake dianchi in lake taihu algal production could be promoted significantly by warming in the spring but not in summer fig 7 which indicates the these algal species in this lake may have already reached their maximum growth rate in the summer under present day conditions huisman et al 2018 on the other hand water temperature could also significantly affect the nutrient concentrations within each lake by altering the natural processes occurring therein e g strengthened denitrification sediment nutrient release etc ding et al 2018 finlay et al 2013 wu et al 2017 and further can affect the growth of algae finlay et al 2013 such impacts of water temperature on nutrient concentrations could be particularly important for lakes for which the effective control of anthropogenic nutrient discharges has been established wu et al 2017 in this study much higher tn concentrations usually occurred in spring and winter and negative relationships were observed between the water temperature and tn concentration in all three lakes p 0 01 fig 8 higher water temperature is beneficial for the denitrification process which converts inorganic n species e g no3 and no2 into n2 and n2o further resulting in decreases in tn concentrations yao et al 2016 zhong et al 2010 it was also previously reported that higher water temperature could promote the releases of p from the sediment and increase tp concentrations in water columns especially in summer ding et al 2018 the strong variations in both tn and tp concentrations within particular lakes could even shift the lakes from following a p limited pattern in spring to an n limited pattern in summer xu et al 2015 this fact indicates that in addition to promoting algal growth changes in water temperature could also cause seasonal changes in nutrient levels which might be good if they lead to deceasing tn concentrations or bad if they lead to increasing tp concentrations for algal control strong seasonal variations in nutrient concentrations and other environmental drivers of algal growth e g water temperature and solar radiation require that season specific rather than one size fits all nutrient management strategies are used for eutrophic lakes richardson et al 2018 taranu et al 2012 considering that societies must make decisions based on trade offs between environmental protection and economic costs it is necessary to adopt nutrient management strategies based on the monthly nutrient thresholds for bloom forming cyanobacteria yu et al 2019 results obtained with the random forest models herein showed that it is more important to control the tp concentration in these lakes than the tn concentration to reduce the chlorophyll a concentrations in therein fig 6 the estimated tn and tp thresholds varied significantly among different seasons in lake taihu the tp criterion to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to below 20 μg l was estimated to be 58 12 μg l in may but increased to 82 18 μg l in september in lake dianchi the tp criterion was estimated to be 149 29 μg l in august but increased to 202 80 μg l in april in lake chaohu the tp criterion was estimated to be 79 29 μg l in september but increased to 100 47 μg l in january fig 5 this suggests that it is feasible and necessary to set flexible nutrient criteria in different months and also that less strict tp criteria might be applied in spring or winter by comparing the estimated tn and tp criteria with the measured nutrient data in 2017 only the measured tp concentrations in summer were much larger than the estimated nutrient criteria from july to october while in other seasons the measured values approached or were even lower than the estimated thresholds fig 5 however in actual environmental management the nutrient control target is usually fixed for the same lake throughout the whole year huo et al 2019 liu et al 2018 which neglects the natural variations in nutrient concentrations and other environmental variables that occur this means that many waterbodies are probably overprotected which increases the economic costs of environmental protection specifically for the studies lakes the control of tp concentrations in summer could be considered a priority while the nutrient criteria might be relaxed slightly in other seasons 4 conclusion in this study we applied random forest models to long term nutrient monitoring and meteorological observational datasets for lake taihu lake dianchi and lake taihu in china this was done to characterize the relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and various environmental drivers establish season specific nutrient thresholds for each lake and assess the potential declines in chlorophyll a concentrations that could be achieved through nutrient management in general the random forest models performed well at predicting chlorophyll a concentrations and successfully displayed monthly variations in chlorophyll a concentrations the estimated tn and tp thresholds were quite variable among different months and were usually stricter in summer than in winter to limit chlorophyll a concentrations to remaining below 20 μg l in august the estimated tn thresholds in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu were 2145 683 2372 918 and 1527 71 μg l respectively and the corresponding tp values were 82 24 149 22 and 120 22 μg l the model results showed that it is more important to control the tp concentration in summer than the tn concentration to reduce the chlorophyll a concentration the strong seasonal variations in the estimated nutrient thresholds suggest that a one size fits all nutrient control target could overprotect these water bodies and increase the economic costs of eutrophication control in addition our results showed that natural changes in water temperature should be considered when

6146,eutrophication and subsequent harmful cyanobacteria blooms are global water quality problems and identifying the key drivers of water eutrophication and estimating nutrient thresholds for it in waterbodies have long been challenges for water quality managers data intensive machine learning models have been shown to be better able to reveal the nonlinear relationships between variables in the study of complex biotic community dynamics than traditional mechanistic models in this study we applied random forest models to long term datasets from nutrient monitoring and meteorological observations to characterize the relationships between algal growth and different environmental drivers in three eutrophic lakes in china we further attempted to estimate the season specific nutrient thresholds in these lakes and assess the potential decreases in chlorophyll a concentrations that could be achieved through nutrient management in general chlorophyll a concentrations predicted by the random forest models were consistent with the values observed in the lakes and successfully displayed the same seasonal variations the estimated total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp nutrient thresholds were quite variable among months and were higher in summer than in winter to maintain chlorophyll a concentrations below 20 μg l the estimated tn thresholds in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu in august were 2145 683 2372 918 and 1527 71 μg l mean standard deviation respectively and the corresponding tp thresholds were 82 24 149 22 and 120 22 μg l the modelling results indicated that it was more important to control the tp concentrations in these lakes than the tn concentrations to control algal growth in summer in summary the strong seasonal variation in the estimated nutrient thresholds suggests that a one size fits all nutrient control target could overprotect these water bodies seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations and environmental drivers should thus be considered when establishing nutrient criteria and setting nutrient control targets keywords nutrient thresholds random forest models season specific nutrient management lake eutrophication 1 introduction eutrophication and subsequent harmful algal blooms habs have become global water quality problems in recent decades conley et al 2009 glibert 2017 huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a habs are usually toxic to humans and other animals can disrupt aquatic food webs and result in hypoxia and loss of biodiversity peñuelas et al 2013 posch et al 2012 van de waal et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 in china the majority of lakes are rather shallow and have become or have been becoming eutrophic since the early 2000s le et al 2010 eutrophication is primarily attributed to intensified anthropogenic nitrogen n and phosphorus p discharges into freshwater ecosystems huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a tong et al 2017a b tong et al 2018 however the relative importance of n and p in the control of eutrophication remains a subject that is intensely debated i e the p only paradigm carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2016 versus the p n paradigm lewis et al 2011 paerl et al 2016b p has traditionally been considered the limiting nutrient for algal growth based on experimental manipulations of lakes in several previous studies schindler et al 2016 and a p only control strategy has been successful in mitigating eutrophication in some lakes lewis et al 2011 however increasing numbers of whole lake experiments have reported that habs are stimulated by combined p and n enrichment rather than by enrichment with n or p alone paerl et al 2016b 2011 besides nutrient enrichment non manageable environmental factors such as lake warming solar radiation and wind speed are also believed to be important in explaining the occurrences of habs huisman et al 2018 lake warming could promote algal growth alter algal composition and increase the concentrations of toxin produced by microcystis spp and planktothrix spp davis et al 2009 paerl et al 2016a reduced water turnover caused by lake warming could be beneficial for buoyant cyanobacteria by allowing them to float upwards posch et al 2012 despite continuous efforts to explore the relationships between the growth of algae and such environment variables our current understanding of these relationships is still unclear and inadequate robson 2014 shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 several strategies e g nutrient discharge control increased flushing chemical treatment sediment dredging and aquatic food web manipulation have been developed to mitigate water eutrophication and control the occurrences of habs huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a reduction to the external nutrient discharges into water bodies is believed to ultimately be the most effective control measure as it addresses the root cause of the problem huisman et al 2018 tong et al 2017b yu et al 2019 before setting a target for nutrient discharge control establishing accurate nutrient thresholds for defining eutrophication in particular water bodies is crucial huo et al 2018 due to the huge geographical differences that occur among watersheds e g differences in climate and land use types and lakes e g with different lake depth and hydrology ecoregion specific criteria have been developed to protect water quality by assuming that lakes in the same ecoregion are affected by the same environmental drivers cardoso et al 2007 poikāne et al 2010 richardson et al 2018 this strategy can make full use of the nutrient monitoring data collected in different lakes and provides an opportunity for nutrient thresholds to be established for lakes without long term monitoring data huo et al 2019 liu et al 2018 however recent studies have revealed that nutrient thresholds in lakes could be lake specific and thus region specific nutrient criteria may fail to reflect the natural variations among lakes liu et al 2019 olson and hawkins 2013 richardson et al 2018 rigosi et al 2014 taranu et al 2012 neglecting such background variations could underprotect water bodies with naturally low nutrient concentrations but overprotect those with naturally high nutrient concentrations olson and hawkins 2013 many studies have also acknowledged the importance of seasonal patterns in environment variables e g water temperature nutrient concentrations and solar radiation to algal growth huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a posch et al 2012 however studies have only rarely addressed the variations in the nutrient thresholds of lakes among different seasons or months establishing nutrient thresholds or criteria for lakes has long been a challenge for water quality managers huo et al 2018 because nutrients are not toxic to aquatic animals at low concentrations nutrient criteria cannot be derived based on the does response relationship used to define threshold levels for toxic pollutants epa 2010 the united states of america us was the first country to establish nutrient criteria for waterbodies epa 2000a huo et al 2018 in 2010 three typical methods were recommended by the us environmental protection agency epa to determine the nutrient criteria for particular lakes which include the reference condition approach mechanistic models and stressor response model epa 2000b epa 2010 in china official technical guidelines for deriving the nutrient criteria for lakes were not issued until 2017 ministry of ecology and environment china 2019 among the methods to establish nutrient criteria the stressor response model which describes the most important known relationships between primary productivity and nutrient concentrations has been the most widely applied in previous studies huo et al 2019 2018 liu et al 2018 the chlorophyll a concentration in a body of water is a water quality index that is closely related to the growth of algae liu et al 2019 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2015 and is thus usually used as a response variable when establishing nutrient thresholds due to the complicated and sometimes unknown mechanisms involved in algal growth the capacity of mechanistic water quality modelling to simulate the dynamics of algae that vary over time remains relatively limited nelson et al 2018 robson 2014 shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 to study such components of complex biotic community dynamics as the nonlinear and unclear relationships between algal growth and major environmental factors data intensive machine learning models e g random forest models artificial neural networks support vector machines etc are among the most rigorous tools available chou et al 2018 garcía nieto et al 2019 liu et al 2019 park et al 2015 these data intensive machine learning models can achieve even better performance in the simulation of algal growth in lakes than that achieved by traditional mechanistic models liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2018 nelson et al 2018 applied random forest models to quantify the nature of the relationships between different environmental conditions and five dominant cyanobacterial genera and estimated the critical nutrient thresholds for different cyanobacterial species liu et al 2019 applied random forest and generalized additive models to assess the predictability of the chlorophyll a concentration in a reservoir and estimate the relative importance of water temperature in driving algal growth many similar studies have demonstrated that machine learning methods could effectively simulate algal growth and develop the site specific nutrient thresholds béjaoui et al 2018 chou et al 2018 park et al 2015 shen et al 2019 the primary goal of this study was to reveal the potential variations in nutrient thresholds in typical eutrophic lakes among different seasons and assess the potential responses of algal growth to nutrient control methods through the use of machine learning models using long term and unified monitoring datasets composed of the monthly nutrient monitoring data and meteorological observations collected from 2006 to 2017 from multiple sampling sites in three eutrophic lakes lake taihu lake dianchi and lake chaohu in china we applied random forest models to simulate the seasonal algal growth estimate the critical nutrient thresholds and assess the potential responses of algal growth to different nutrient control strategies in each lake the results obtained could offer new insights into how flexible and season specific nutrient thresholds can be set in eutrophic lakes while accounting for the natural variations in environmental variables which is crucial for water quality management and reducing the risks of harmful algal blooms in the long term 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake descriptions three typical eutrophic freshwater lakes in china including lake taihu lake chaohu and lake dianchi were selected for examination in this study fig s1 these lakes have received much attention from water quality managers in china since the early 2000s because of their serious eutrophication and frequent occurrences of habs in them ministry of ecology and environment china 2012 lake taihu 31 41 n 120 14 e is located in the southeastern part of the yangtze river basin fig s1 it is a large and shallow lake with an area of 2340 km2 an average depth of 2 2 m and a water volume of 4 4 billion m3 xu et al 2015 in lake taihu the most damaging and extensive outbreak of habs occurred in 2007 which severely affected the water supply of wuxi city and left over two million people without drinking waters for several weeks stone 2011 lake dianchi 25 01 n 102 66 e is the largest plateau lake in a traditional phosphate ore mining region of china with an area of 309 km2 an average depth of 5 0 m and a water volume of 1 56 billion m3 wu et al 2017 lake chaohu 31 56 n 117 38 e is the fifth largest freshwater lake in the lower yangtze river basin in china with an area of 768 km2 an average depth of 2 7 m and a water volume of 20 7 billion m3 huang et al 2018 2 2 long term nutrient monitoring and meteorological observational dataset the data examined in this study consisted of monthly water quality data including the chlorophyll a μg l total nitrogen tn μg l total phosphorus tp μg l and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n μg l concentrations and secchi depth sd cm in each lake and monthly meteorological observations including daily water temperature c precipitation mm day wind speed m s and sunshine duration h day data from january 2006 to december 2017 similarly to previous studies chou et al 2018 huo et al 2019 2018 liu et al 2019 we used the chlorophyll a concentration as a proxy for the algal growth in the lakes although some other variables could also impact algal growth to the best of our knowledge the selected factors examined here included the major potential drivers of algal growth huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a and these variables were also consistently measured with the same standardized methods throughout the study period in each lake water quality monitoring was carried out at multiple sampling sites 17 sampling sites in lake taihu 10 in lake dianchi and 7 in lake chaohu and the detailed distribution of detailed sampling sites in each lake was shown in fig s1 meteorological information was collected from the national meteorological station operated by the china meteorological administration near the lakes http data cma cn the procedures for collecting water samples and measuring nutrient concentrations were consistent throughout the whole study period and were based on the technical specifications requirements for monitoring of surface water and wastewater in china hjt 91 2002 water samples were collected at a depth of about 0 5 m below the water surface the tn concentration was determined by persulfate digestion followed by automated colorimetric analysis n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride spectrophotometry with a method detection limit mdl of 50 μg l the tp concentration was determined by persulfate digestion followed by automated colorimetric analysis ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate under acidic conditions with an mdl of 10 μg l chlorophyll a concentrations were determined by acetone extraction followed by separation by centrifugation separation and the determination of sample absorbance with an mdl of 1 μg l all nutrient concentrations lower than the mdl were set to 1 2 of the mdl in subsequent data analyses the monthly averaged meteorological data were calculated based on the daily observations in summary the complete raw dataset comprised a total of 5726 chlorophyll a concentrations 2800 for lake taihu 1430 for lake dianchi and 1496 for lake chaohu 5768 tn concentrations 2843 for lake taihu 1429 for lake dianchi and 1496 for lake chaohu and 5768 tp concentrations 2843 for lake taihu 1429 for lake dianchi and 1496 for lake chaohu a summary of the monitoring data collected during the study period in the three lakes is provided in table 1 2 3 random forest models we applied random forest models a typical machine learning method relying on the input of large dataset liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2018 to the nutrient monitoring and meteorological observational dataset to characterize the relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and different environment variables the input variables in the model include nutrient monitoring data chlorophyll a tn tp nh4 n and sd and meteorological data water temperature precipitation wind speed and sunshine duration in each lake fig 1 the random forest model is a machine learning algorithm that is used to fit a large ensemble of randomly assembled decorrelated classification or regression trees to bootstrapped samples of a response variable which then averages the outputs of these trees to produce a simulated response nelson et al 2018 the random forest model was previously shown to be good at handling data containing the complicated interactions and at uncovering the nonlinear and linear relationship structures within such datasets it has been successfully applied in simulating seasonal algal growth in previous studies liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2018 in this study a random forest model was developed by using the randomforest package in r 3 2 3 and spss modeler 18 0 ibm usa models were performed by the following steps 1 the historical dataset for each lake during 2006 2016 was portioned into training and testing folds with 90 of the dataset randomly selected as the training fold that was used to build the random forest model 2 the random forests were grown through calculations in r or spss modeler and the models performance was assessed using the testing fold 3 the models performance was validated by predicting monthly chlorophyll a concentrations in 2017 and comparing these to observed values steps 1 3 were repeated for nine times with each new fold representing the testing set in each iteration and 4 the partial dependence of all of the explanatory variables was calculated the post training model was used to estimate the seasonal nutrient thresholds targeted at different chlorophyll a concentrations e g 10 20 μg l and so on and assess the potential responses of chlorophyll a concentrations to different nutrient control strategies or water temperatures when estimating response of chlorophyll a concentrations to reductions of nutrient concentrations in each lake three scenarios were assumed 10 reduction in tn or tp concentration 20 reduction in tn or tp concentration and 50 reduction in tn or tp concentration relative to the monthly monitoring data in 2017 three scenarios with different water temperatures were assumed 10 increase 20 increase and 50 increase relative to the monthly monitoring data in 2017 fig 1 the models performance was quantified using the coefficient of determination r2 calculated between the predicted and observed chlorophyll a concentrations partial dependence values in the random forest models were also calculated by r 3 2 3 as a measure of each explanatory variable s influence on the response variable given the effects of all the other explanatory variables in the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of long term nutrient monitoring results fig 2 shows the monthly changes in chlorophyll a tn and tp concentrations from 2006 to 2017 in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu among these three lakes lake dianchi had the highest chlorophyll a tn and tp concentrations in 2017 chlorophyll a tn and tp concentrations mean standard deviation in lake dianchi were 86 85 2226 895 and 137 69 μg l respectively which were all much higher than the corresponding values recorded in lake taihu and lake chaohu the tn and tp concentrations in lake dianchi were also much higher than the grade iii limit for water quality that is usually used as a standard for clean lakes in china which is defined as a tn concentration of 1000 μg l and a tp concentration of 50 μg l ministry of ecology and environment china 2002 in lake taihu and lake chaohu the chlorophyll a concentrations in 2017 were 18 32 and 11 14 μg l mean standard deviation respectively and their tn and tp concentrations approached or were slightly higher than the grade iii limits for lakes in china during the study period the tp concentration declined significantly in all three lakes while the tn concentration was only observed to have declined in lake taihu and lake dianchi in response to these changes in tn and tp concentrations chlorophyll a concentrations gradually declined in lake taihu and lake chaohu from the year 2006 onward with a monthly decrease of 0 11 μg l in lake taihu p 0 01 n 144 and of 0 14 μg l in lake chaohu p 0 01 n 144 while no significant decline in chlorophyll a concentration was observed in lake dianchi p 0 1 n 143 clear seasonal patterns in chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations were observed in all three lakes fig 1 for instance in lake taihu lower tn concentrations usually occurred in summer and higher tn concentrations usually occurred in spring possibly due to changes in internal nutrient cycling finlay et al 2013 tong et al 2019 zhong et al 2010 in 2017 the tn concentration in july 1118 461 μg l mean standard deviation in lake taihu was even 50 of the tn concentration in this same lake in april 2640 1020 μg l driven by increased water temperatures huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a higher chlorophyll a concentrations usually occurred in summer strong spatial variations in nutrient concentrations were observed among different monitoring sites within the same lake fig s2 significant relationships were observed between the tn or tp concentration and the chlorophyll a concentration p 0 01 indicating that nutrients were important drivers of algal growth tables s1 s3 3 2 performance of random forest models in general the results of modeling by random forests fit the training data very well in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu the r2 values calculated for the relationships between the predicted and observed chlorophyll a concentrations in the training datasets were 0 66 0 04 n 9 0 79 0 03 n 9 and 0 73 0 05 n 9 respectively fig s3 in previous studies carried out using linear regression models lrm or generalized additive models gam r2 coefficient values between predicted and observed chlorophyll a concentrations approaching or above 0 2 were believed to indicate effective prediction by the models huo et al 2018 liu et al 2018 this indicates that the random forest models used herein could simulate algal growth quite successfully the results of the comparison of the cross validated predictions to the testing data are provided in fig 3 a and these results showed that the random forest models made better predictions of chlorophyll a concentrations in lake dianchi r2 0 48 0 37 0 64 n 9 and lake chaohu r2 0 50 0 34 0 68 n 9 than of those in lake taihu r2 0 26 0 12 0 43 n 9 the models were further validated by predicting the monthly chlorophyll a concentration in each lake in 2017 and comparing it to the observed value as shown in fig 3b the predicted results effectively displayed the correct seasonal variation in chlorophyll a concentrations and were quite consistent with the observed concentrations in all three lakes for lake taihu r2 0 27 p 0 01 n 204 for lake dianchi r2 0 38 p 0 01 n 120 and for lake chaohu r2 0 19 p 0 01 n 96 shown in fig s4 3 3 seasonal variations in nutrient thresholds in eutrophic lakes partial dependence plots for the random forest models revealed that the relationships between the response variable and the explanatory variable were predominantly nonlinear and the curves representing these were composed of the average modelled values across the range of observed values of the explanatory variable hastie et al 2009 nelson et al 2018 in this study the steepest curves were associated with the tn concentration tp concentration water temperature and secchi depth measured in the lakes while the nh4 n sunshine duration precipitation and wind speed variables were largely invariant fig 4 in general the chlorophyll a concentration had a relatively stronger partial dependence on the tp concentration in these lakes in particular these curves indicated that there was a threshold in the relationship between the tp concentration and chlorophyll a concentration where the partial dependence rose sharply for tp concentrations between 100 and 350 μg l fig 4 in lake taihu this curve plateaued at tp concentrations greater than about 200 μg l while in lake chaohu and lake dianchi these curves plateaued after about 300 μg l compared with the curves for the tp concentration the curves between the tn concentration and chlorophyll a concentration were less steep particularly in lake dianchi and lake chaohu with a tn concentration of 3000 μg l the chlorophyll a concentration remained stable even as the tn concentrations increased fig 4 this result possibly indicates that algae in different lakes could respond differently to the same changes in nutrient concentrations olson and hawkins 2013 richardson et al 2018 as the water temperature rose the chlorophyll a concentration increased gradually fig 4 in lake dianchi a sudden and steep increase in chlorophyll a concentrations occurred at a water temperature of 25 c while in lake chaohu a steep increase occurred at a water temperature of 30 c suggesting that different algal species could have different sensitivities to increasing water temperatures huisman et al 2018 and that the algae in lake dianchi could grow well at mild temperatures wang et al 2019 by applying the random forest models we estimated the seasonal variations in the tn and tp thresholds in these lakes that were needed to target different chlorophyll a concentration limits when estimating thresholds for one variable we used the monthly monitoring data in these lakes for 2017 as inputs to the models in general the estimated tn and tp thresholds varied significantly among different lakes and different months fig 5 to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to below 20 μg l the estimated monthly tn thresholds in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu were 2180 479 2340 295 and 1849 261 μg l respectively the estimated monthly tp thresholds in these lakes were 66 9 149 28 and 100 22 μg l respectively fig 5 significant variations in nutrient thresholds were also observed among different seasons in lake taihu the tp threshold to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to below 20 μg l was estimated to be 58 12 μg l in may but increased to 82 18 μg l in september in lake chaohu the tn threshold was estimated to be 1472 45 μg l in july but increased to 2438 200 μg l in february the estimated tn and tp thresholds in this study approached the results estimated in a previous study based on bioassay experiments in lake taihu xu et al 2015 which were 1260 μg l for tn and 82 μg l for tp to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to 20 μg l in summer the results of comparing the estimated tn and tp thresholds with the measured results in 2017 showed that the measured tn concentrations approached or were even lower than the estimated thresholds except for those in the spring in lake chaohu however the measured tp concentrations were still much higher than the predicted thresholds in summer fig 5 for instance in lake taihu the measured tp concentration 132 51 μg l in september was much higher than the estimated threshold value 82 18 μg l indicating that the high tp concentrations could possibly be responsible for the high chlorophyll a concentration observed there in summer 3 4 responses of chlorophyll a to changes in nutrients and water temperature quantifying how algal growth responds to declines in the tn and tp concentrations in lakes is of great importance to setting nutrient control targets for water quality management huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2015 by applying the random forest models we estimated the potential declines in chlorophyll a concentrations under scenarios with decreases in tn or tp concentrations of different magnitudes fig 6 shows that the chlorophyll a concentrations in different lakes could have quite different responses to the same decreases in tn and tp concentrations and greater decreases in chlorophyll a concentrations were observed in scenarios with tp declines than in those with tn declines with a decline in the tp concentration but no change in the tn concentration a significant reduction in the chlorophyll a concentration was observed in all three lakes larger declines in chlorophyll a concentration were observed with greater decreases in tp concentrations the largest decrease in chlorophyll a concentration in these scenarios usually occurred in the summer from july to october in all three lakes while only slight changes were observed in spring and winter fig 6a in august the chlorophyll a concentrations in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu were predicted to decline from 50 14 to 39 8 μg l from 175 120 to 140 100 μg l and from 14 18 to 7 1 μg l respectively with a 50 decline in the tp concentration relative to the measured values however in spring and winter the decline in the chlorophyll a concentration in these lakes was usually 10 fig 6a compared with its response to tp concentration the response of the chlorophyll a concentration to decreases in the tn concentration was not significant fig 6b in all three lakes the chlorophyll a concentration was only observed to decline as the tn decreased in lake chaohu in spring while only slight changes were observed in the other seasons and lakes there being different responses of chlorophyll a concentration to nutrient declines in different lakes and seasons revealed the importance of adopting a season specific nutrient management strategy for controlling the growth of algae we further estimated the responses of chlorophyll a concentrations to scenarios in which water temperatures increased and found that the promotion of algal growth by increased water temperature could be quite different in different seasons fig 7 in lake taihu a 20 increase in water temperature was estimated to result in a 16 and 23 increase in the chlorophyll a concentration in march and may respectively while the corresponding increases in chlorophyll a concentration in july and august were 5 indicating that water temperature might not be a limiting factor for algal growth in this lake in summer huisman et al 2018 in lake dianchi the response of chlorophyll a concentrations to increased temperature was less significant throughout the year fig 7 which is consistent with the results presented in fig 4 3 5 implications to future nutrient management in lakes although a full mechanistic understanding of the relationships between algal growth and environment variables remains to be attained liu et al 2019 nelson et al 2018 shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 the simulated chlorophyll a concentrations produced by the random forest models established in this study were fairly robust figs 3 s2 and s3 and demonstrated the importance of establishing lake specific and season specific tn or tp thresholds for the control of algal blooms in lakes fig 5 ecoregion based nutrient criteria provide the possibility of establishing nutrient thresholds for lakes for which long term nutrient monitoring data are not available huo et al 2019 2018 and the variations among individual lakes can then represent historical changes in nutrient concentrations olson and hawkins 2013 region based nutrient criteria have been proposed and applied in previously established regional and national nutrient management strategies for lakes epa 2000a huo et al 2018 and they have proven to be effective in water quality protection in some regions huo et al 2018 however recent studies have revealed that the relative importance of different environmental variables to algal growth could be lake specific and season specific rather than region specific richardson et al 2018 taranu et al 2012 the natural variations among lakes within the same ecoregion could be so large that the adoption of region based nutrient criteria could underprotect waterbodies with naturally low nutrient concentrations and overprotect those with naturally high nutrient concentrations olson and hawkins 2013 for each eutrophic lake selected for use in this study the estimated nutrient thresholds were quite different particularly the tp thresholds fig 5 the estimated tn nutrient thresholds to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to below 20 μg l were 2180 479 μg l for lake taihu 2340 295 μg l for lake dianchi and 1849 261 μg l for lake chaohu in lake dianchi the corresponding tp threshold was estimated to be 149 28 μg l which was much larger than the estimated values for lake taihu 66 9 μg l with a range of 56 82 μg l and lake chaohu 100 22 μg l with a range of 62 126 μg l lake dianchi is located in a traditional phosphate ore mining area in china which thus has a naturally high background tp concentration reaching 100 μg l as early as 1982 ouyang et al 2015 the previously estimated tn and tp criteria for the region wherein lake dianchi was located were estimated to be about 500 μg l and about 20 μg l respectively huo et al 2018 the previously estimated tn and tp criteria for the region wherein lake taihu and lake chaohu were located were about 360 785 μg l and about 14 43 μg l respectively huo et al 2018 because of lack of specific nutrient criteria for many individual lakes the grade iii limits for tn 1000 μg l and tp 50 μg l have also been used as the standards for defining clean lakes in china ministry of ecology and environment china 2002 yu et al 2019 however the estimated tn and tp thresholds for the three lakes in this study were much higher than the region based nutrient criteria and the grade iii limits fig 5 which suggests the possibility that these nutrient criteria might have overprotected the water quality of these lakes besides the nutrient enrichment of lakes huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a water temperature is also believed to be a crucial factor determining the algal growth huisman et al 2018 paerl et al 2016a dimictic lakes usually have a heightened susceptibility to cyanobacterial blooms under stratified eutrophic conditions taranu et al 2012 lake warming may promote the growth of many bloom forming species of cyanobacteria and lead to the more stable stratification of the water column and reduced water turnover posch et al 2012 lake warming could cause changes in algal compositions and further alterations in toxin concentrations posch et al 2012 different algal species in lakes could have different responses to increasing water temperatures and toxic microcystis spp exhibited more significantly elevated growth rates than non toxic species davis et al 2009 cyanobacterial species typically reach their maximum growth rates at water temperatures of approximately 30 c while chlorophytes and dinoflagellates species usually reach their maximum growth rates at about 25 c paerl et al 2016a due to concerns over the negative impacts of algal blooms caused by climate change new nutrient management strategies have been proposed such as setting updated nutrient reduction targets and establishing stricter nutrient criteria for the impacted waterbodies huo et al 2019 liu et al 2018 in this study the analyses of different scenarios carried out using the random forest models showed that the responses of chlorophyll a concentrations to lake warming could differ among different lakes and seasons algal growth was not sensitive to lake warming throughout the year in lake dianchi in lake taihu algal production could be promoted significantly by warming in the spring but not in summer fig 7 which indicates the these algal species in this lake may have already reached their maximum growth rate in the summer under present day conditions huisman et al 2018 on the other hand water temperature could also significantly affect the nutrient concentrations within each lake by altering the natural processes occurring therein e g strengthened denitrification sediment nutrient release etc ding et al 2018 finlay et al 2013 wu et al 2017 and further can affect the growth of algae finlay et al 2013 such impacts of water temperature on nutrient concentrations could be particularly important for lakes for which the effective control of anthropogenic nutrient discharges has been established wu et al 2017 in this study much higher tn concentrations usually occurred in spring and winter and negative relationships were observed between the water temperature and tn concentration in all three lakes p 0 01 fig 8 higher water temperature is beneficial for the denitrification process which converts inorganic n species e g no3 and no2 into n2 and n2o further resulting in decreases in tn concentrations yao et al 2016 zhong et al 2010 it was also previously reported that higher water temperature could promote the releases of p from the sediment and increase tp concentrations in water columns especially in summer ding et al 2018 the strong variations in both tn and tp concentrations within particular lakes could even shift the lakes from following a p limited pattern in spring to an n limited pattern in summer xu et al 2015 this fact indicates that in addition to promoting algal growth changes in water temperature could also cause seasonal changes in nutrient levels which might be good if they lead to deceasing tn concentrations or bad if they lead to increasing tp concentrations for algal control strong seasonal variations in nutrient concentrations and other environmental drivers of algal growth e g water temperature and solar radiation require that season specific rather than one size fits all nutrient management strategies are used for eutrophic lakes richardson et al 2018 taranu et al 2012 considering that societies must make decisions based on trade offs between environmental protection and economic costs it is necessary to adopt nutrient management strategies based on the monthly nutrient thresholds for bloom forming cyanobacteria yu et al 2019 results obtained with the random forest models herein showed that it is more important to control the tp concentration in these lakes than the tn concentration to reduce the chlorophyll a concentrations in therein fig 6 the estimated tn and tp thresholds varied significantly among different seasons in lake taihu the tp criterion to limit the chlorophyll a concentration to below 20 μg l was estimated to be 58 12 μg l in may but increased to 82 18 μg l in september in lake dianchi the tp criterion was estimated to be 149 29 μg l in august but increased to 202 80 μg l in april in lake chaohu the tp criterion was estimated to be 79 29 μg l in september but increased to 100 47 μg l in january fig 5 this suggests that it is feasible and necessary to set flexible nutrient criteria in different months and also that less strict tp criteria might be applied in spring or winter by comparing the estimated tn and tp criteria with the measured nutrient data in 2017 only the measured tp concentrations in summer were much larger than the estimated nutrient criteria from july to october while in other seasons the measured values approached or were even lower than the estimated thresholds fig 5 however in actual environmental management the nutrient control target is usually fixed for the same lake throughout the whole year huo et al 2019 liu et al 2018 which neglects the natural variations in nutrient concentrations and other environmental variables that occur this means that many waterbodies are probably overprotected which increases the economic costs of environmental protection specifically for the studies lakes the control of tp concentrations in summer could be considered a priority while the nutrient criteria might be relaxed slightly in other seasons 4 conclusion in this study we applied random forest models to long term nutrient monitoring and meteorological observational datasets for lake taihu lake dianchi and lake taihu in china this was done to characterize the relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and various environmental drivers establish season specific nutrient thresholds for each lake and assess the potential declines in chlorophyll a concentrations that could be achieved through nutrient management in general the random forest models performed well at predicting chlorophyll a concentrations and successfully displayed monthly variations in chlorophyll a concentrations the estimated tn and tp thresholds were quite variable among different months and were usually stricter in summer than in winter to limit chlorophyll a concentrations to remaining below 20 μg l in august the estimated tn thresholds in lakes taihu dianchi and chaohu were 2145 683 2372 918 and 1527 71 μg l respectively and the corresponding tp values were 82 24 149 22 and 120 22 μg l the model results showed that it is more important to control the tp concentration in summer than the tn concentration to reduce the chlorophyll a concentration the strong seasonal variations in the estimated nutrient thresholds suggest that a one size fits all nutrient control target could overprotect these water bodies and increase the economic costs of eutrophication control in addition our results showed that natural changes in water temperature should be considered when

6147,for urban stormwater management the low impact development lid concept has been widely applied due to its perceived beneficial effects on restoring to the original hydrological cycle through both field monitoring and mathematical modeling this research evaluated the combined effects of several lid measures especially under heavy rainfall events that could otherwise have caused flooding problems a pilot sponge city project in china was evaluated as a case study comparison of hydrologic quantities among different scenarios under large storm events was made through modeling the results demonstrated that the runoff volume capture ratio of the existing lid plan for the monitoring period is 97 and it can reduce the volume of runoff by 50 8 74 6 reduce peak flow rate by 72 3 87 5 and extend the lag time by 12 30 min if the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall goal of 80 is solely met the resulting lid plan can t restore to the natural hydrology in order to restore close to the original hydrological cycle especially under the larger storm events the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall should be set to 82 for the pilot project keywords low impact development practices hydrologic restoration field monitoring storm water management model large storm events 1 introduction urbanization has changed the land use types and increased the impervious area which has led to an increase of surface runoff volume de macedo et al 2017 o sullivan et al 2015 in order to better manage the stormwater low impact development lid a new approach has been widely applied chui et al 2016 gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 shafique and kim 2017 for this purpose the chinese government put forward the sponge city initiative jia et al 2017 li et al 2017 with the lid approach as an essential component to design and apply the lid more properly additional research on its hydrologic performance is necessary there are some studies paying attention to a certain type of lid such as green roof rain garden permeable pavement and so on davis 2008 fassman beck et al 2016 kazemi et al 2017 shafique et al 2018 stovin et al 2012 the goal of lid application is to mimic pre development hydrology and control the non point pollution produced by runoff these studies have shown that certain type of lid in some cases with proper design can effectively control runoff and remove the pollutants on a developed site shafique et al 2018 however it is common that several types of lid are used in the same project taking sponge city construction in china as an example the effect of a certain project will be assessed not by each lid each type of lid facilities has its own special functionalities which means that some may strengthen infiltration and some may focus on increasing storage the combined effect of different types of lid facilities needs to be analyzed field monitoring of lid performance is the basis for other complicated research compared to test in the laboratory it is more correspondent to the real situation davis 2008 had monitored a bioretention for 2 years and evaluated its performance on hydrology hunt et al 2008 did the monitoring work of runoff quality for a bioretention some research paid attention to other types of lid facilities brattebo and booth 2003 fassman beck et al 2016 kazemi et al 2017 through the data analysis the effectiveness of lid can be evaluated objectively however the limitation for field monitoring is that it is difficult to assess the effect under rarely occurred large storms which has become a serious problem for urban development along with the climate change han et al 2018 pumo et al 2017 some present research predicted the effect of lid on large storm events is minimal brander et al 2004 holmann dodds et al 2003 williams and wise 2006 it is necessary to conduct the quantitative evaluation under large even extreme storm events as the field monitoring under large storm events is difficult to conduct it is important to use mathematical models to do the evaluation the storm water management model swmm developed by the usepa a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model has been extensively used in the worldwide scale for single event and continuous simulation campisano et al 2017 rossman 2010 since version5 1 a new lid module has been added many researchers have paid attention to its use in simulation of the lid effects palanisamy and chui 2015 they studied the simulation method and gave some recommendations to improve it peng and stovin 2017 zhang and guo 2015 it is expected that performance of various types of lid on stormwater management can be simulated in this study the field monitoring and swmm simulation were combined to evaluate the effect and discuss the degree of hydrologic restoration of several types of lid one of the pilot demonstration projects for sponge city construction was taken as a case study and it has applied various types of lid practices through one year field monitoring sufficient data were collected for evaluating the effect of the project and calibrating the numerical model it s possible to do the comparison and analysis under large even extreme storm events through the model simulation 2 project description the project is located in tsingtao which is one of the sponge pilot cities in shandong province eastern china according to the planning of tsingtao the city is divided into 68 partitions the project belongs to the 17th partition and the location is shown in fig 1 tsingtao lies in a temperate zone and has a monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation 709 mm which is mainly concentrated in summer the proportions of precipitation in spring summer autumn and winter are 14 57 22 and 7 respectively from june to september the proportion is more than 60 the total area of the project is 11 262 m2 including building 1840 m2 road 1770 m2 pavement 2299 m2 and green land 5353 m2 after development the impervious percentage is about 52 5 for the sponge city construction the goal is to mimic the hydrology before development and one of the core indexes is volume capture ratio of annual rainfall which means that discharge flow shouldn t appear under the rainfall events smaller than the control goal by collecting and analyzing the precipitation data for 30 years in tsingtao the relationship graph between volume capture ratio of annual rainfall and design precipitation can be obtained shown as fig 2 the related term is precipitation volume capture ratio pvcr in hydrological field which is originally used by zhang et al 2016 according to the plan the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall is set to be 80 for the project and the corresponding design precipitation is 33 5 mm it means that there should not be runoff discharging when the precipitation is smaller than 33 5 mm 2 1 lid design and placement in order to meet the control goal several kinds of lid practices were applied in the project fig 3 shows the general design plan through the application of lid all the runoff of subcatchments was routed through lid rather than discharged into drainage pipe networks directly based on the land use each specific kind of lid was chosen as followed for the green land under most of the light rains there is rarely runoff from the green land itself while it also can store additional runoff from other adjacent areas some green land around buildings and roads was transformed to be sunken grass land in order to store more runoff from building roofs and roads due to the terrain map where the east and west are higher and steeper it s easy for the runoff to gather into the central part two rain gardens were set there with the area of 200 m2 and 250 m2 respectively which plays the core role to store the runoff and increase the groundwater recharge mcmaine 2013 they are interconnected and one of them is connected to a storage pond with 100 m3 capacity the structure of the rain gardens is shown as fig 4 a there are several kinds of native plants that mainly grow in summer according to the design plan the total height of berm is 300 mm the soil layer is 500 mm and its permeability is about 2 5 mm h the storage layer is 300 mm and filled with natural gravel where an underdrain system is used the rain garden is connected to the storage pond and when the storage pond is filled up the water will flow into the over flow pipe fig 4 b for the road and pavement in the project area before the sponge city transformation they were totally impervious different permeable pavement materials were used according to the different conditions mainly considering the land use a permeable system mainly includes pavement layer and storage layer where there might be an underdrain system below the storage layer it is the native soil in this project all the permeable pavement doesn t have an underdrain system as rain falls onto a permeable pavement system the small depressions can trap part of rainwater and the pavement layer can adsorb a lot the rest of rainwater can move downward through the pavement layer into next layer as the pavement layers could have an extremely high permeability the surface runoff seldom occurs brattebo and booth 2003 collins et al 2008 for the road the base layer wasn t changed while the surface layer was replaced by the porous asphalt whose thickness is 180 mm shown as fig 5 a although its permeability is lower which is about 200 mm h it has a better bearing the parking lot was transformed to be permeable through the combination of masonry and soil due to some grass growing in the soil the percent of the impervious area for the parking lot decreases to 50 at the same time the roughness increases above the base layer there are grits and macroporous concrete that can also improve the permeability shown as fig 5 b permeable brick shown as fig 5 c was used in parts of cultural square and sidewalk for the building roof the flat part was covered by the soil and some grass was planted as a kind of lid the green roof can reduce the runoff from the building roof alfredo et al 2010 there is one rain barrel to collect the extra runoff the capacity of the rain barrel is 0 5 m3 1 m height and 0 5 m2 bottom area fig 6 shows the rain barrel photo and descripts the routing of runoff from building roof after sponge transformation in summary there are 5177 m2 area of the project ground that was transformed to the sponge area by applying lid the area ratio for lid and its service area is 1 1 2 except rain garden and sunken grass land others are not only for stromwater management but also can be used for walking or recreation so the area percentage of lid that only used to manage the stormwater is 5 6 the size for each lid practice is counted as table1 2 2 field monitoring data availability the project sponge transformation was completed in march 2017 the monitoring work was done from may 1 2017 one thwater rain gauge no 17310104 was installed on the roof to collect background information about the precipitation fig 7 a when the storage is filled up the runoff will overflow into the drainage pipes before entering into the municipal pipe networks there is a manhole and one thwater flow meter no 17620144 was positioned fig 7 b the minimum detection level of the rain gauge is 0 2 mm for the flow meter the velocity s minimum detection level is 0 01 m s and the water depth s minimum detection level is 0 001 m it can record the outfall flow rates by each minute up to may 1 2018 58 rainfalls have been monitored most of the monitored events were small enough so that lid facilities could absorb all runoff produced in the project there were only three storm events respectively on jul 25 aug 1 and aug 5 where the flow of outfall was detected 3 methods 3 1 model establishment and lid scenarios the aim of lid application is to mimic the hydrology of predevelopment so the model that reflects the predevelopment condition was developed as a basis for comparison it is helpful to understand the impact of development in order to make a reasonable comparison and analyze the effect of lid application in the project the models of the project before and after sponge transformation were developed because there is a control goal descripted by volume capture ratio of annual rainfall a hypothetical design planning of lid was proposed which can just meet the goal the model of hypothetical lid planning was developed to compare with the existing planning considering the aim of lid application to restoring nature different lid plans were designed to mimic the hydrology of predevelopment in total five scenarios were developed by using of storm water management model swmm 1 a scenario of the project before development descripted as predevelopment 2 a scenario of the project before sponge transformation descripted as post development 3 a scenario of the project after existing lid application descripted as lid1 4 a scenario of the project with a hypothetical design planning to meet the annual rainfall capture goal descripted as lid2 5 a scenario of the project with different hypothetical design plans to restore nature descripted as lid3 when the project hasn t been developed the type of land use is totally green land the entire watershed was represented by a single catchment and no manmade infrastructure was included after the development most of the runoff entered into the drainage pipes directly in order to avoid the flooding the model was established based on the structure of the pipe networks there are 19 nodes 39 subcatchments and 1 outfall in total shown as fig 8 a the swmm pipe flow routing model was built on the basis of dynamic wave and the horton formula was used as infiltration model after sponge transformation different kinds of lid practices were simulated by using the lid module in swmm the vertical layers are surface pavement storage layer soil and an optional underdrain each kind of lid may have some special properties and a lot of research have paid attention to their simulation by swmm since the version 5 1 006 came out alfredo et al 2010 peng and stovin 2017 zhang and guo 2015 according to these related research the swmm version 5 1 with newly added lid module has the capability of simulating the stormwater management performance of various types of lid practices according to the lid design and these related research set the parameters for each kind of lid control i e sunken green land rain garden permeable road permeable parking lot permeable brick green roof and rain barrel then added them to specific subcatchment in keeping with its size besides the application of lid the routing relationship of runoff also changed instead of routing into drainage pipes directly the runoff from each subcatchment entered into lid firstly as a result in swmm the outlets of some subcatchments need to be changed shown as fig 8 b because not all of the parameters can be measured it s important to calibrate and verify the model peng and stovin 2017 only the verified model can be used for predictions the swmm was used to regenerate the runoff in response to the rainfall events during which the discharge flow appeared because a significant rainfall event usually need to have return period greater than 1 year stovin et al 2012 the model was calibrated under the rainfall on august 5 and verified under the rainfall on july 25 and august 1 as the rainfall on august 5 is heavier than the other two events there is more monitored flow data at the outfall the features of the three rainfall events are shown as table 2 the parameters were adjusted under the rainfall event on august 5 fig 9 a as fig 9 b shows after the calibration the model is able to simulate the outflow close to the measured data correlation coefficient r2 is commonly used to reflect the tendency similarity between the two variables closer to 1 the two variables share more similar tendency it can be calculated by the eq 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is widely used to assess the goodness of fit of hydrologic models mccuen et al 2006 the eq 2 is used to calculate the nse value between modeled and monitored data different from r2 nse not only assesses the tendency but also compares the absolute value between the variables the nse closer to 1 the model is more reliable 1 r 2 x y cov 2 x y v a r x v a r y where x and y represent monitored and modeled data r2 correlation coefficient cov x y the covariance of x and y var the variance 2 nse 1 t 1 t q o t q m t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q o t is the monitored value of t moment q m t is the modeled value of t moment q o is the average value of all the monitored data under the three rainfall events the total runoff discharge volumes by monitoring and simulation are similar the simulated discharge volumes are smaller than the monitored values for august 1 and august 5 events but larger for july 25 event all the r2 value of three rainfall events is higher than 0 9 and the nse is higher than 0 8 shown as table 3 the calibrated swmm model is credible and has a good performance in simulating the effect of lid practices for the sponge city construction there are various lid practices in the project based on the model which reflects the existing lid design hypothetical design plans were simulated for lid2 most of lid practices were removed and only rain gardens and permeable parking lots remained with the same design structure for lid3 the structure of lid practices keeps the same and the size was adjusted 3 2 simulation of hydrologic performance under different intensity rainfall events design storms are critical for hydrologic engineering as inputs to models kimoto et al 2011 this paper focused on the effect of lid under relatively heavy rainfall which may cause the flooding however it s much more difficult to monitor the performance of lid under heavy rainfall events according to the climate of tsingtao and the monitoring data of precipitation the rain pattern is relatively close to the chicago rainfall type the rainfall distribution formula is shown as eq 3 the rainfall events with return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year were designed with a duration of 120 min the features of each intensity rainfall event are shown as table 4 the models of five scenarios were run under these rainfall events respectively through model simulation lid performances under heavier rainfall events are assessed 3 q 1561 32 1 0 831 l g p t 20 54 0 878 where q rainstorm intensity mm h p return period a t duration of rainfall min 4 results and discussion 4 1 runoff volume capture ratio under entire annual events during the one year monitoring period the daily precipitation and the outfall flow is shown as fig 10 according to the monitoring result of the flow meter the outfall appeared flow only on july 25 august 1 and august 5 the total precipitation for the year is 629 9 mm and mainly concentrated in july and august with the volume proportion of 70 4 among the 58 rainfall events there are 7 rainfall events with a precipitation higher than the control threshold 33 5 mm the information of these 7 rainfall events and the total discharge runoff are shown as table 5 based on the whole year monitoring data the smallest precipitation depth where there was a flow monitored is 46 mm on august 1 2017 for the entire year there is no runoff discharged under most of rainfall events the runoff volume capture ratio for the evaluation period can be calculated by eq 4 from may 1 2017 to may 1 2018 the runoff volume capture ratio of the project is 97 5 4 α 10 3 i 0 n r i a 0 i n q i 10 3 i 0 n r i a 100 where α runoff volume capture ratio r i the total precipitation for the evaluation period mm a area of the project m2 q i the flow of the outfall m3 based on the continuous simulation in swmm the total discharge volume for the entire year is 159 0 m3 and the runoff volume capture ratio is 97 7 for the evaluation period according to the goal of volume capture ratio of annual rainfall which is 80 the corresponding precipitation is 33 5 mm if the rainfall events where the precipitation is more than 33 5 mm generates runoff and discharges the total flow of the outfall for the evaluation period is 969 7 m3 and the runoff volume capture ratio should be 86 3 based on the results both of monitoring and simulation it is certainly that the project not only meets the control goal but also exceeds it according to the simulation by swmm the runoff volume capture ratios for predevelopment and post development during the evaluation period are 85 5 and 47 2 respectively the development has changed the catchment hydrology and the runoff volume is 3 64 times the predevelopment through the sponge transformation the performance on runoff volume control is much better than the post development condition and even better than the scenario that is totally non developed pre developed more runoff being controlled means that there will be more rain water infiltration or can be reused being much higher than the goal it will be safer for the project to prevent a flooding and make a bigger contribution to the runoff control at the pilot city scale nevertheless its design may be redundancy in some degree there is room to reduce some lid and reduce the cost take the cost into consideration only use rain garden and permeable parking lot to control the runoff descripted as lid2 rg1 rg2 and pl2 keep the same size with lid1 and pl1 is only the half size the land area percentage of lid is 9 5 through continuous simulation in swmm for this year the runoff volume capture ratio is 86 and can just meet the control goal about 86 3 for the monitoring period 4 2 runoff volume reduction under individual heavy rainfall events before sponge transformation the volume of runoff was huge and flooding even occured under heavier rainfalls the monitoring results have shown that the application of lid can significantly reduce the runoff for most of the rainfall events by swmm simulation the comparison was made under different intensity of rainfall events mainly the strong ones in a short time volumetric runoff coefficient is used to evaluated the runoff volume reduction and it is calculated as the runoff volume divided by the rainfall volume dhakal et al 2012 the volume of simulated surface runoff and calculated volumetric runoff coefficients are shown as table 6 for 2 to 200 year rainfall events as the rainfall strengthens the runoff coefficient increases no matter in which scenarios focused on the scenarios of before and after sponge transformation i e post development and lid1 the difference between their runoff coefficients reduces when the rainfall strengthens shown as fig 11 under the 2 year storm event the reduction ratio of runoff coefficient is up to 74 6 and it is only 50 8 under 100 year storm event according to the results of some research davis 2008 hood et al 2007 lid practices especially the infiltration based measures play a more effective role under smaller more frequent storm events return period 0 5 or 1 year this paper mainly paid attention to the lager storm events although compared to the more frequent storm events lid is less effective at controlling runoff quantity the effect is still significant due to the total quantity of runoff is much more any tiny reduction means that there has been a lot of rain water being controlled even compared to the scenario of predevelopment the existing lid design lid1 can control more runoff under different return period storm events however the hypothetical lid design plan lid2 which just meet the goal can t have a significant effect under relative large storm events the difference between lid2 and post development scenarios is about 0 1 0 2 reduction in runoff coefficient under different storm events 4 3 peak flow rate reduction under individual heavy rainfall events fig 12 shows the simulated outflow hydrographs for four modeled scenarios for several design storms the resulting hydrographs for the post development show the nearly coincident shape between flow rate and rainfall intensity compared with the predevelopment the curve is more spiculate it is obvious that the application of existing lid changed the shape of hydrograph for the 2 5 10 and 25 year rainfall events the hydrograph under lid1 is flat compared to the post development the peak is not evident when the return period of rainfall event is less than 10 year for the extreme storm events there are two peaks of hydrograph when lid1 applied the first peak is related to the rainfall peak and the second is related to the usage of the storage pond s1 fig 3 resulted in a delayed discharge fig 13 shows the change of water depth for the storage whose maximum possible depth is 2 5 m under 2 5 and 10 year rainfall events the maximum water depth is still smaller than 2 5 m so there is no overflow from the storage under 25 year rainfall event the maximum water depth has increased to 2 5 m however when the storage is filled up the rainfall is nearly over and there is no obvious overflow from the storage as a result except under 50 and 100 year rainfall events there is only one peak of the flow rate under 50 and 100 year rainfall events the storage is filled up at 110 min and 95 min when the rainfall continues and more runoff routes into the storage as it can t storage any more water the flow just passes into the pipes and the second peak appears for the scenario of lid2 the curve is between the predevelopment and post development under lager storm events the application of lid2 can recover the catchment hydrology to some degree but can t make the same with the predevelopment moreover there is still an obvious peak under the storm events rather than only analyze the total reduction in runoff volume it is more important to consider how much reduction in the peak flow rate which is closely related to the drainage related flooding problem reducing peak flow is also meaningful to reduce erosion scour and sediment transport in the receiving stream davis 2008 table 7 compares the peak flow rates among the four scenarios in all cases the application of lid1 reduces the peak flow rate dramatically compared to the post development the reduction ratio of peak flow rate is 72 3 87 5 as the rainfall strengthens the reduction ratio of peak flow rate decreases compared to the reduction of volumetric runoff coefficient shown in table 6 the reduction ratio for the peak flow rate is higher under extreme storm events the efficiency of lid1 to reduce the peak flow rate seemed even more obvious compared to the post development taking the 100 year storm event as an example the reduction ratio of volumetric runoff coefficient is near to 50 but the reduction ratio of peak flow rate is still more than 70 shown as fig 14 the hypothetical design planning lid2 can also reduce the peak flow rate but the effect is limited compared to the post development scenario the reduction ratio of peak flow rate is smaller than 50 in all cases however the reduction ratio on peak flow rate is more obvious than it on runoff volume the application of lid also appears to extend the lag time the time interval from the peak rainfall intensity to the peak runoff rate compared to the post development scenario as depicted in table 8 in all modeled storm events the scenario of lid has a longer time to peak flow than the post development for the post development model the time to peak flow seems depend totally on the rainfall peak and there is no difference among different design storm events this can be expected because the runoff mainly come from the impervious subcatchments such as buildings roads and pavements compared to the green land in the post development scenario manning s n for these impervious subcatchments are small so that the lag time is shorter no matter how large the design intensity of the storm event is the time to peak flow is very close to the time of peak rainfall for the scenario of lid1 the lag time changes along with the storm recurrence interval under smaller storm events the lag times are longer compared to the post development scenario the difference in lag time is the largest under the 2 year return period storm event when the return period increases to 5 years and 10 years the difference is smaller under the return period 25 year 50 year and 100 year storm events the differences are even smaller which means the efficiency of lid on increasing the lag time is not changing much more this is likely because that most of the impervious subcatchments have been transformed by using different lid measures after the sponge transformation the lag time is influenced by the effect of each lid but under large storms such as the 25 50 and 100 year storm events the lid measures are quickly filled so the lag times are smaller and similar for the scenario of lid2 the lag times are smaller than lid1 and they are similar under different storm events when the storm recurrence interval is longer than 10 years the lag time keeps the same 7 min although the effect on extending the lag time is not as significant as the lid1 it is still remarkable 4 4 ability to restore natural hydrology the existing lid1 design plan doesn t only meet the control goal the performance is also better than the predevelopment on stormwater management considering the reduction of runoff volume and peak flow rate the design planning lid2 can meet the requirement of volume capture ratio of annual rainfall which is 80 the corresponding runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period is 86 3 during the monitoring period the runoff volume capture ratio of lid2 is 86 and is very close to the predevelopment 85 5 however it can t restore to the original hydrological cycle as the important benefit of lid is to restore to the nature take reduction of runoff volume and peak flow rate under large storm events as the indexes to design lid planning which can meet the goal of being close to the predevelopment conditions first of all taking runoff volume reduction which is evaluated by volumetric runoff coefficient under 100 year storm event as the goal lid3 1 was designed in the scenario of lid3 1 rain garden permeable parking and sunken grass land were kept rain garden and sunken grass land keep the same with lid1 as for permeable parking the pk1 is the same but the size of pk2 reduced to the half the volumetric runoff coefficient of lid3 1 design is close to the predevelopment under 100 year storm events both of them are 0 65 moreover taking peak flow rate reduction under 100 year storm event as the goal lid3 2 was designed in the scenario of lid3 2 rain garden permeable parking sunken grass land and permeable road were kept except permeable road the size and structure and size of other lid practices kept the same for the permeable road its structure was not changed but the size reduced to half under 100 year storm event the peak flow is the same with the predevelopment both are 0 23 m3 s the scenario of predevelopment lid3 1 and lid3 2 were modelled under different large storm events as well as the continuous simulation for one year all the indexes are shown in table 9 through the lid design planning and runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period the control degree of stormwater is lid3 2 lid3 1 fig 15 a shows the volumetric runoff coefficient of different scenarios it seems that the application of lid decreases the difference among different storm events when the storm intensity increases although the runoff increases for all the scenarios the scenarios of lid3 increase less fig 15 b shows the peak flow of different scenarios different from runoff coefficient the curves which represent lid scenarios are a little steeper for lid2 under all the larger storm events the volumetric runoff coefficient and peak flow are larger than the predevelopment because most of the rainfall event s recurrence interval is smaller than 1 year the lid2 control limited stormwater which can only meet the capture goal and be close to the predevelopment on runoff volume capture ratio during the monitoring period the effect is not enough under larger storm events for lid3 1 under 25 year 50 year and 100 year storm events its runoff coefficients are close to the predevelopment but under 2 year 5 year and 10 year storm events the runoff coefficients are still larger than the predevelopment as for the peak flows they are higher than the predevelopment under all the storm events for lid3 2 its effect on stormwater control is a little better than the predevelopment in general under relative extreme storm events the peak flows are close but the runoff coefficients are smaller under 2 year storm event the runoff coefficient is close to the predevelopment but the peak flow is decreased overall speaking only making the runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period decrease to the predevelopment isn t enough to restore the original water recycle under larger storm events to be totally the same with predevelopment by lid application is not easy but the effect can be close if more attention is paid to the prevention of flooding the runoff volume capture ratio during the monitoring period should be about 89 for the project and it will be able to be close to the predevelopment condition especially under the larger storm events according to the precipitation data during the monitoring period the total precipitation for the one year is 629 9 mm if runoff volume capture ratio is 89 the corresponding design precipitation should be 36 2 mm which is higher than 33 5 mm the calculation process is as following 629 9 1 89 69 2 mm 41 5 48 5 49 46 65 36 4 69 2 6 36 2 mm by using the 30 year precipitation data fig 2 the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall can be gotten and it is 82 it means that the goal should be higher than the existing goal 80 to restore the natural hydrology 5 conclusions one of the sponge city transformation projects in tsingtao china was taken as an example to evaluate the effect of several combinations of lid measures by field monitoring and mathematical model swmm simulation the hydrologic performances not only under the entire annual events were assessed but also the effects under hypothetical high intensity rainfall events the heavy rainfall events are more pertinent to the urban flooding problems and not as easy to monitor in the field the precipitation and flow rate at outfall were monitored for one year from may 1 2017 to may 1 2018 the results show that the runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period is 97 5 for the project and it can certainly meet the goal of sponge city construction the measured data was used to calibrate and verify the swmm model the model was able to simulate the monitored results closely through continuous simulation for one year the runoff volume capture ratio is 97 7 for the monitoring period that is very close to the monitored 97 5 for the scenario of predevelopment and post development the simulated runoff volume capture ratios are 85 5 and 47 2 respectively considering the volume capture ratio goal of annual rainfall is only 80 and for the monitoring period the runoff volume capture ratio should be 86 3 a hypothetical lid design lid2 which can closely meet the goal with 86 runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period was proposed to make comparisons the four scenarios predevelopment post development existing lid application lid1 and a hypothetical lid design planning lid2 were modeled and comparisons were made under 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year storms respectively by application of the existing lid measures lid1 the volumetric runoff coefficient is reduced by 50 8 to 74 6 with better effects under smaller rainfall events as for the flood mitigation peak flow rate is a key indicator for scenario of lid1 the reduction ratio of peak flow is 72 3 to 87 5 under different design storm events compared to the effect on runoff volume reduction it seems that the use of lid measures was more efficient for peak flow rate reduction in terms of percentage reduction compared to the post development conditions moreover the lag time has been extended by lid measures the impact is more significant and apparent when the rainfall intensity is not high under relatively extreme storm events the impacts on lag time are smaller and less discernable for the lid2 application scenario which can just meet the sponge city goal the effect on managing stormwater under large storm events is quite limited for the runoff volume the reduction in volumetric runoff coefficient is about 0 1 0 2 compared to the post development conditions under different storm events e g reduction from 0 69 to 0 50 for the 2 year storm the effect on peak flow reduction is a little more remarkable with higher reduction ratio of peak flow rate by 34 0 to 56 3 e g reduction from 0 16 to 0 07 m3 s for the 2 year storm the corresponding lag time is extended by 7 to 15mins however the hypothetical lid planning doesn t have the capacity to reduce outflow volume and peak flow rate to that of the predevelopment condition and it is not enough to prevent the flooding taking reduction of runoff volume and peak flow rate under large storm events as the indexes series of lid3 design plans were designed and applied for the project in order to restore the natural hydrology for the mitigating the flooding problems and restoring the natural hydrology under larger storm events the runoff volume capture ratio during the monitoring period should be about 89 for the pilot project the goal of corresponding design precipitation and volume capture ratio of annual rainfall are 36 2 mm and 82 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare

6147,for urban stormwater management the low impact development lid concept has been widely applied due to its perceived beneficial effects on restoring to the original hydrological cycle through both field monitoring and mathematical modeling this research evaluated the combined effects of several lid measures especially under heavy rainfall events that could otherwise have caused flooding problems a pilot sponge city project in china was evaluated as a case study comparison of hydrologic quantities among different scenarios under large storm events was made through modeling the results demonstrated that the runoff volume capture ratio of the existing lid plan for the monitoring period is 97 and it can reduce the volume of runoff by 50 8 74 6 reduce peak flow rate by 72 3 87 5 and extend the lag time by 12 30 min if the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall goal of 80 is solely met the resulting lid plan can t restore to the natural hydrology in order to restore close to the original hydrological cycle especially under the larger storm events the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall should be set to 82 for the pilot project keywords low impact development practices hydrologic restoration field monitoring storm water management model large storm events 1 introduction urbanization has changed the land use types and increased the impervious area which has led to an increase of surface runoff volume de macedo et al 2017 o sullivan et al 2015 in order to better manage the stormwater low impact development lid a new approach has been widely applied chui et al 2016 gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 shafique and kim 2017 for this purpose the chinese government put forward the sponge city initiative jia et al 2017 li et al 2017 with the lid approach as an essential component to design and apply the lid more properly additional research on its hydrologic performance is necessary there are some studies paying attention to a certain type of lid such as green roof rain garden permeable pavement and so on davis 2008 fassman beck et al 2016 kazemi et al 2017 shafique et al 2018 stovin et al 2012 the goal of lid application is to mimic pre development hydrology and control the non point pollution produced by runoff these studies have shown that certain type of lid in some cases with proper design can effectively control runoff and remove the pollutants on a developed site shafique et al 2018 however it is common that several types of lid are used in the same project taking sponge city construction in china as an example the effect of a certain project will be assessed not by each lid each type of lid facilities has its own special functionalities which means that some may strengthen infiltration and some may focus on increasing storage the combined effect of different types of lid facilities needs to be analyzed field monitoring of lid performance is the basis for other complicated research compared to test in the laboratory it is more correspondent to the real situation davis 2008 had monitored a bioretention for 2 years and evaluated its performance on hydrology hunt et al 2008 did the monitoring work of runoff quality for a bioretention some research paid attention to other types of lid facilities brattebo and booth 2003 fassman beck et al 2016 kazemi et al 2017 through the data analysis the effectiveness of lid can be evaluated objectively however the limitation for field monitoring is that it is difficult to assess the effect under rarely occurred large storms which has become a serious problem for urban development along with the climate change han et al 2018 pumo et al 2017 some present research predicted the effect of lid on large storm events is minimal brander et al 2004 holmann dodds et al 2003 williams and wise 2006 it is necessary to conduct the quantitative evaluation under large even extreme storm events as the field monitoring under large storm events is difficult to conduct it is important to use mathematical models to do the evaluation the storm water management model swmm developed by the usepa a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model has been extensively used in the worldwide scale for single event and continuous simulation campisano et al 2017 rossman 2010 since version5 1 a new lid module has been added many researchers have paid attention to its use in simulation of the lid effects palanisamy and chui 2015 they studied the simulation method and gave some recommendations to improve it peng and stovin 2017 zhang and guo 2015 it is expected that performance of various types of lid on stormwater management can be simulated in this study the field monitoring and swmm simulation were combined to evaluate the effect and discuss the degree of hydrologic restoration of several types of lid one of the pilot demonstration projects for sponge city construction was taken as a case study and it has applied various types of lid practices through one year field monitoring sufficient data were collected for evaluating the effect of the project and calibrating the numerical model it s possible to do the comparison and analysis under large even extreme storm events through the model simulation 2 project description the project is located in tsingtao which is one of the sponge pilot cities in shandong province eastern china according to the planning of tsingtao the city is divided into 68 partitions the project belongs to the 17th partition and the location is shown in fig 1 tsingtao lies in a temperate zone and has a monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation 709 mm which is mainly concentrated in summer the proportions of precipitation in spring summer autumn and winter are 14 57 22 and 7 respectively from june to september the proportion is more than 60 the total area of the project is 11 262 m2 including building 1840 m2 road 1770 m2 pavement 2299 m2 and green land 5353 m2 after development the impervious percentage is about 52 5 for the sponge city construction the goal is to mimic the hydrology before development and one of the core indexes is volume capture ratio of annual rainfall which means that discharge flow shouldn t appear under the rainfall events smaller than the control goal by collecting and analyzing the precipitation data for 30 years in tsingtao the relationship graph between volume capture ratio of annual rainfall and design precipitation can be obtained shown as fig 2 the related term is precipitation volume capture ratio pvcr in hydrological field which is originally used by zhang et al 2016 according to the plan the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall is set to be 80 for the project and the corresponding design precipitation is 33 5 mm it means that there should not be runoff discharging when the precipitation is smaller than 33 5 mm 2 1 lid design and placement in order to meet the control goal several kinds of lid practices were applied in the project fig 3 shows the general design plan through the application of lid all the runoff of subcatchments was routed through lid rather than discharged into drainage pipe networks directly based on the land use each specific kind of lid was chosen as followed for the green land under most of the light rains there is rarely runoff from the green land itself while it also can store additional runoff from other adjacent areas some green land around buildings and roads was transformed to be sunken grass land in order to store more runoff from building roofs and roads due to the terrain map where the east and west are higher and steeper it s easy for the runoff to gather into the central part two rain gardens were set there with the area of 200 m2 and 250 m2 respectively which plays the core role to store the runoff and increase the groundwater recharge mcmaine 2013 they are interconnected and one of them is connected to a storage pond with 100 m3 capacity the structure of the rain gardens is shown as fig 4 a there are several kinds of native plants that mainly grow in summer according to the design plan the total height of berm is 300 mm the soil layer is 500 mm and its permeability is about 2 5 mm h the storage layer is 300 mm and filled with natural gravel where an underdrain system is used the rain garden is connected to the storage pond and when the storage pond is filled up the water will flow into the over flow pipe fig 4 b for the road and pavement in the project area before the sponge city transformation they were totally impervious different permeable pavement materials were used according to the different conditions mainly considering the land use a permeable system mainly includes pavement layer and storage layer where there might be an underdrain system below the storage layer it is the native soil in this project all the permeable pavement doesn t have an underdrain system as rain falls onto a permeable pavement system the small depressions can trap part of rainwater and the pavement layer can adsorb a lot the rest of rainwater can move downward through the pavement layer into next layer as the pavement layers could have an extremely high permeability the surface runoff seldom occurs brattebo and booth 2003 collins et al 2008 for the road the base layer wasn t changed while the surface layer was replaced by the porous asphalt whose thickness is 180 mm shown as fig 5 a although its permeability is lower which is about 200 mm h it has a better bearing the parking lot was transformed to be permeable through the combination of masonry and soil due to some grass growing in the soil the percent of the impervious area for the parking lot decreases to 50 at the same time the roughness increases above the base layer there are grits and macroporous concrete that can also improve the permeability shown as fig 5 b permeable brick shown as fig 5 c was used in parts of cultural square and sidewalk for the building roof the flat part was covered by the soil and some grass was planted as a kind of lid the green roof can reduce the runoff from the building roof alfredo et al 2010 there is one rain barrel to collect the extra runoff the capacity of the rain barrel is 0 5 m3 1 m height and 0 5 m2 bottom area fig 6 shows the rain barrel photo and descripts the routing of runoff from building roof after sponge transformation in summary there are 5177 m2 area of the project ground that was transformed to the sponge area by applying lid the area ratio for lid and its service area is 1 1 2 except rain garden and sunken grass land others are not only for stromwater management but also can be used for walking or recreation so the area percentage of lid that only used to manage the stormwater is 5 6 the size for each lid practice is counted as table1 2 2 field monitoring data availability the project sponge transformation was completed in march 2017 the monitoring work was done from may 1 2017 one thwater rain gauge no 17310104 was installed on the roof to collect background information about the precipitation fig 7 a when the storage is filled up the runoff will overflow into the drainage pipes before entering into the municipal pipe networks there is a manhole and one thwater flow meter no 17620144 was positioned fig 7 b the minimum detection level of the rain gauge is 0 2 mm for the flow meter the velocity s minimum detection level is 0 01 m s and the water depth s minimum detection level is 0 001 m it can record the outfall flow rates by each minute up to may 1 2018 58 rainfalls have been monitored most of the monitored events were small enough so that lid facilities could absorb all runoff produced in the project there were only three storm events respectively on jul 25 aug 1 and aug 5 where the flow of outfall was detected 3 methods 3 1 model establishment and lid scenarios the aim of lid application is to mimic the hydrology of predevelopment so the model that reflects the predevelopment condition was developed as a basis for comparison it is helpful to understand the impact of development in order to make a reasonable comparison and analyze the effect of lid application in the project the models of the project before and after sponge transformation were developed because there is a control goal descripted by volume capture ratio of annual rainfall a hypothetical design planning of lid was proposed which can just meet the goal the model of hypothetical lid planning was developed to compare with the existing planning considering the aim of lid application to restoring nature different lid plans were designed to mimic the hydrology of predevelopment in total five scenarios were developed by using of storm water management model swmm 1 a scenario of the project before development descripted as predevelopment 2 a scenario of the project before sponge transformation descripted as post development 3 a scenario of the project after existing lid application descripted as lid1 4 a scenario of the project with a hypothetical design planning to meet the annual rainfall capture goal descripted as lid2 5 a scenario of the project with different hypothetical design plans to restore nature descripted as lid3 when the project hasn t been developed the type of land use is totally green land the entire watershed was represented by a single catchment and no manmade infrastructure was included after the development most of the runoff entered into the drainage pipes directly in order to avoid the flooding the model was established based on the structure of the pipe networks there are 19 nodes 39 subcatchments and 1 outfall in total shown as fig 8 a the swmm pipe flow routing model was built on the basis of dynamic wave and the horton formula was used as infiltration model after sponge transformation different kinds of lid practices were simulated by using the lid module in swmm the vertical layers are surface pavement storage layer soil and an optional underdrain each kind of lid may have some special properties and a lot of research have paid attention to their simulation by swmm since the version 5 1 006 came out alfredo et al 2010 peng and stovin 2017 zhang and guo 2015 according to these related research the swmm version 5 1 with newly added lid module has the capability of simulating the stormwater management performance of various types of lid practices according to the lid design and these related research set the parameters for each kind of lid control i e sunken green land rain garden permeable road permeable parking lot permeable brick green roof and rain barrel then added them to specific subcatchment in keeping with its size besides the application of lid the routing relationship of runoff also changed instead of routing into drainage pipes directly the runoff from each subcatchment entered into lid firstly as a result in swmm the outlets of some subcatchments need to be changed shown as fig 8 b because not all of the parameters can be measured it s important to calibrate and verify the model peng and stovin 2017 only the verified model can be used for predictions the swmm was used to regenerate the runoff in response to the rainfall events during which the discharge flow appeared because a significant rainfall event usually need to have return period greater than 1 year stovin et al 2012 the model was calibrated under the rainfall on august 5 and verified under the rainfall on july 25 and august 1 as the rainfall on august 5 is heavier than the other two events there is more monitored flow data at the outfall the features of the three rainfall events are shown as table 2 the parameters were adjusted under the rainfall event on august 5 fig 9 a as fig 9 b shows after the calibration the model is able to simulate the outflow close to the measured data correlation coefficient r2 is commonly used to reflect the tendency similarity between the two variables closer to 1 the two variables share more similar tendency it can be calculated by the eq 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is widely used to assess the goodness of fit of hydrologic models mccuen et al 2006 the eq 2 is used to calculate the nse value between modeled and monitored data different from r2 nse not only assesses the tendency but also compares the

average value of all the monitored data under the three rainfall events the total runoff discharge volumes by monitoring and simulation are similar the simulated discharge volumes are smaller than the monitored values for august 1 and august 5 events but larger for july 25 event all the r2 value of three rainfall events is higher than 0 9 and the nse is higher than 0 8 shown as table 3 the calibrated swmm model is credible and has a good performance in simulating the effect of lid practices for the sponge city construction there are various lid practices in the project based on the model which reflects the existing lid design hypothetical design plans were simulated for lid2 most of lid practices were removed and only rain gardens and permeable parking lots remained with the same design structure for lid3 the structure of lid practices keeps the same and the size was adjusted 3 2 simulation of hydrologic performance under different intensity rainfall events design storms are critical for hydrologic engineering as inputs to models kimoto et al 2011 this paper focused on the effect of lid under relatively heavy rainfall which may cause the flooding however it s much more difficult to monitor the performance of lid under heavy rainfall events according to the climate of tsingtao and the monitoring data of precipitation the rain pattern is relatively close to the chicago rainfall type the rainfall distribution formula is shown as eq 3 the rainfall events with return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 year were designed with a duration of 120 min the features of each intensity rainfall event are shown as table 4 the models of five scenarios were run under these rainfall events respectively through model simulation lid performances under heavier rainfall events are assessed 3 q 1561 32 1 0 831 l g p t 20 54 0 878 where q rainstorm intensity mm h p return period a t duration of rainfall min 4 results and discussion 4 1 runoff volume capture ratio under entire annual events during the one year monitoring period the daily precipitation and the outfall flow is shown as fig 10 according to the monitoring result of the flow meter the outfall appeared flow only on july 25 august 1 and august 5 the total precipitation for the year is 629 9 mm and mainly concentrated in july and august with the volume proportion of 70 4 among the 58 rainfall events there are 7 rainfall events with a precipitation higher than the control threshold 33 5 mm the information of these 7 rainfall events and the total discharge runoff are shown as table 5 based on the whole year monitoring data the smallest precipitation depth where there was a flow monitored is 46 mm on august 1 2017 for the entire year there is no runoff discharged under most of rainfall events the runoff volume capture ratio for the evaluation period can be calculated by eq 4 from may 1 2017 to may 1 2018 the runoff volume capture ratio of the project is 97 5 4 α 10 3 i 0 n r i a 0 i n q i 10 3 i 0 n r i a 100 where α runoff volume capture ratio r i the total precipitation for the evaluation period mm a area of the project m2 q i the flow of the outfall m3 based on the continuous simulation in swmm the total discharge volume for the entire year is 159 0 m3 and the runoff volume capture ratio is 97 7 for the evaluation period according to the goal of volume capture ratio of annual rainfall which is 80 the corresponding precipitation is 33 5 mm if the rainfall events where the precipitation is more than 33 5 mm generates runoff and discharges the total flow of the outfall for the evaluation period is 969 7 m3 and the runoff volume capture ratio should be 86 3 based on the results both of monitoring and simulation it is certainly that the project not only meets the control goal but also exceeds it according to the simulation by swmm the runoff volume capture ratios for predevelopment and post development during the evaluation period are 85 5 and 47 2 respectively the development has changed the catchment hydrology and the runoff volume is 3 64 times the predevelopment through the sponge transformation the performance on runoff volume control is much better than the post development condition and even better than the scenario that is totally non developed pre developed more runoff being controlled means that there will be more rain water infiltration or can be reused being much higher than the goal it will be safer for the project to prevent a flooding and make a bigger contribution to the runoff control at the pilot city scale nevertheless its design may be redundancy in some degree there is room to reduce some lid and reduce the cost take the cost into consideration only use rain garden and permeable parking lot to control the runoff descripted as lid2 rg1 rg2 and pl2 keep the same size with lid1 and pl1 is only the half size the land area percentage of lid is 9 5 through continuous simulation in swmm for this year the runoff volume capture ratio is 86 and can just meet the control goal about 86 3 for the monitoring period 4 2 runoff volume reduction under individual heavy rainfall events before sponge transformation the volume of runoff was huge and flooding even occured under heavier rainfalls the monitoring results have shown that the application of lid can significantly reduce the runoff for most of the rainfall events by swmm simulation the comparison was made under different intensity of rainfall events mainly the strong ones in a short time volumetric runoff coefficient is used to evaluated the runoff volume reduction and it is calculated as the runoff volume divided by the rainfall volume dhakal et al 2012 the volume of simulated surface runoff and calculated volumetric runoff coefficients are shown as table 6 for 2 to 200 year rainfall events as the rainfall strengthens the runoff coefficient increases no matter in which scenarios focused on the scenarios of before and after sponge transformation i e post development and lid1 the difference between their runoff coefficients reduces when the rainfall strengthens shown as fig 11 under the 2 year storm event the reduction ratio of runoff coefficient is up to 74 6 and it is only 50 8 under 100 year storm event according to the results of some research davis 2008 hood et al 2007 lid practices especially the infiltration based measures play a more effective role under smaller more frequent storm events return period 0 5 or 1 year this paper mainly paid attention to the lager storm events although compared to the more frequent storm events lid is less effective at controlling runoff quantity the effect is still significant due to the total quantity of runoff is much more any tiny reduction means that there has been a lot of rain water being controlled even compared to the scenario of predevelopment the existing lid design lid1 can control more runoff under different return period storm events however the hypothetical lid design plan lid2 which just meet the goal can t have a significant effect under relative large storm events the difference between lid2 and post development scenarios is about 0 1 0 2 reduction in runoff coefficient under different storm events 4 3 peak flow rate reduction under individual heavy rainfall events fig 12 shows the simulated outflow hydrographs for four modeled scenarios for several design storms the resulting hydrographs for the post development show the nearly coincident shape between flow rate and rainfall intensity compared with the predevelopment the curve is more spiculate it is obvious that the application of existing lid changed the shape of hydrograph for the 2 5 10 and 25 year rainfall events the hydrograph under lid1 is flat compared to the post development the peak is not evident when the return period of rainfall event is less than 10 year for the extreme storm events there are two peaks of hydrograph when lid1 applied the first peak is related to the rainfall peak and the second is related to the usage of the storage pond s1 fig 3 resulted in a delayed discharge fig 13 shows the change of water depth for the storage whose maximum possible depth is 2 5 m under 2 5 and 10 year rainfall events the maximum water depth is still smaller than 2 5 m so there is no overflow from the storage under 25 year rainfall event the maximum water depth has increased to 2 5 m however when the storage is filled up the rainfall is nearly over and there is no obvious overflow from the storage as a result except under 50 and 100 year rainfall events there is only one peak of the flow rate under 50 and 100 year rainfall events the storage is filled up at 110 min and 95 min when the rainfall continues and more runoff routes into the storage as it can t storage any more water the flow just passes into the pipes and the second peak appears for the scenario of lid2 the curve is between the predevelopment and post development under lager storm events the application of lid2 can recover the catchment hydrology to some degree but can t make the same with the predevelopment moreover there is still an obvious peak under the storm events rather than only analyze the total reduction in runoff volume it is more important to consider how much reduction in the peak flow rate which is closely related to the drainage related flooding problem reducing peak flow is also meaningful to reduce erosion scour and sediment transport in the receiving stream davis 2008 table 7 compares the peak flow rates among the four scenarios in all cases the application of lid1 reduces the peak flow rate dramatically compared to the post development the reduction ratio of peak flow rate is 72 3 87 5 as the rainfall strengthens the reduction ratio of peak flow rate decreases compared to the reduction of volumetric runoff coefficient shown in table 6 the reduction ratio for the peak flow rate is higher under extreme storm events the efficiency of lid1 to reduce the peak flow rate seemed even more obvious compared to the post development taking the 100 year storm event as an example the reduction ratio of volumetric runoff coefficient is near to 50 but the reduction ratio of peak flow rate is still more than 70 shown as fig 14 the hypothetical design planning lid2 can also reduce the peak flow rate but the effect is limited compared to the post development scenario the reduction ratio of peak flow rate is smaller than 50 in all cases however the reduction ratio on peak flow rate is more obvious than it on runoff volume the application of lid also appears to extend the lag time the time interval from the peak rainfall intensity to the peak runoff rate compared to the post development scenario as depicted in table 8 in all modeled storm events the scenario of lid has a longer time to peak flow than the post development for the post development model the time to peak flow seems depend totally on the rainfall peak and there is no difference among different design storm events this can be expected because the runoff mainly come from the impervious subcatchments such as buildings roads and pavements compared to the green land in the post development scenario manning s n for these impervious subcatchments are small so that the lag time is shorter no matter how large the design intensity of the storm event is the time to peak flow is very close to the time of peak rainfall for the scenario of lid1 the lag time changes along with the storm recurrence interval under smaller storm events the lag times are longer compared to the post development scenario the difference in lag time is the largest under the 2 year return period storm event when the return period increases to 5 years and 10 years the difference is smaller under the return period 25 year 50 year and 100 year storm events the differences are even smaller which means the efficiency of lid on increasing the lag time is not changing much more this is likely because that most of the impervious subcatchments have been transformed by using different lid measures after the sponge transformation the lag time is influenced by the effect of each lid but under large storms such as the 25 50 and 100 year storm events the lid measures are quickly filled so the lag times are smaller and similar for the scenario of lid2 the lag times are smaller than lid1 and they are similar under different storm events when the storm recurrence interval is longer than 10 years the lag time keeps the same 7 min although the effect on extending the lag time is not as significant as the lid1 it is still remarkable 4 4 ability to restore natural hydrology the existing lid1 design plan doesn t only meet the control goal the performance is also better than the predevelopment on stormwater management considering the reduction of runoff volume and peak flow rate the design planning lid2 can meet the requirement of volume capture ratio of annual rainfall which is 80 the corresponding runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period is 86 3 during the monitoring period the runoff volume capture ratio of lid2 is 86 and is very close to the predevelopment 85 5 however it can t restore to the original hydrological cycle as the important benefit of lid is to restore to the nature take reduction of runoff volume and peak flow rate under large storm events as the indexes to design lid planning which can meet the goal of being close to the predevelopment conditions first of all taking runoff volume reduction which is evaluated by volumetric runoff coefficient under 100 year storm event as the goal lid3 1 was designed in the scenario of lid3 1 rain garden permeable parking and sunken grass land were kept rain garden and sunken grass land keep the same with lid1 as for permeable parking the pk1 is the same but the size of pk2 reduced to the half the volumetric runoff coefficient of lid3 1 design is close to the predevelopment under 100 year storm events both of them are 0 65 moreover taking peak flow rate reduction under 100 year storm event as the goal lid3 2 was designed in the scenario of lid3 2 rain garden permeable parking sunken grass land and permeable road were kept except permeable road the size and structure and size of other lid practices kept the same for the permeable road its structure was not changed but the size reduced to half under 100 year storm event the peak flow is the same with the predevelopment both are 0 23 m3 s the scenario of predevelopment lid3 1 and lid3 2 were modelled under different large storm events as well as the continuous simulation for one year all the indexes are shown in table 9 through the lid design planning and runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period the control degree of stormwater is lid3 2 lid3 1 fig 15 a shows the volumetric runoff coefficient of different scenarios it seems that the application of lid decreases the difference among different storm events when the storm intensity increases although the runoff increases for all the scenarios the scenarios of lid3 increase less fig 15 b shows the peak flow of different scenarios different from runoff coefficient the curves which represent lid scenarios are a little steeper for lid2 under all the larger storm events the volumetric runoff coefficient and peak flow are larger than the predevelopment because most of the rainfall event s recurrence interval is smaller than 1 year the lid2 control limited stormwater which can only meet the capture goal and be close to the predevelopment on runoff volume capture ratio during the monitoring period the effect is not enough under larger storm events for lid3 1 under 25 year 50 year and 100 year storm events its runoff coefficients are close to the predevelopment but under 2 year 5 year and 10 year storm events the runoff coefficients are still larger than the predevelopment as for the peak flows they are higher than the predevelopment under all the storm events for lid3 2 its effect on stormwater control is a little better than the predevelopment in general under relative extreme storm events the peak flows are close but the runoff coefficients are smaller under 2 year storm event the runoff coefficient is close to the predevelopment but the peak flow is decreased overall speaking only making the runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period decrease to the predevelopment isn t enough to restore the original water recycle under larger storm events to be totally the same with predevelopment by lid application is not easy but the effect can be close if more attention is paid to the prevention of flooding the runoff volume capture ratio during the monitoring period should be about 89 for the project and it will be able to be close to the predevelopment condition especially under the larger storm events according to the precipitation data during the monitoring period the total precipitation for the one year is 629 9 mm if runoff volume capture ratio is 89 the corresponding design precipitation should be 36 2 mm which is higher than 33 5 mm the calculation process is as following 629 9 1 89 69 2 mm 41 5 48 5 49 46 65 36 4 69 2 6 36 2 mm by using the 30 year precipitation data fig 2 the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall can be gotten and it is 82 it means that the goal should be higher than the existing goal 80 to restore the natural hydrology 5 conclusions one of the sponge city transformation projects in tsingtao china was taken as an example to evaluate the effect of several combinations of lid measures by field monitoring and mathematical model swmm simulation the hydrologic performances not only under the entire annual events were assessed but also the effects under hypothetical high intensity rainfall events the heavy rainfall events are more pertinent to the urban flooding problems and not as easy to monitor in the field the precipitation and flow rate at outfall were monitored for one year from may 1 2017 to may 1 2018 the results show that the runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period is 97 5 for the project and it can certainly meet the goal of sponge city construction the measured data was used to calibrate and verify the swmm model the model was able to simulate the monitored results closely through continuous simulation for one year the runoff volume capture ratio is 97 7 for the monitoring period that is very close to the monitored 97 5 for the scenario of predevelopment and post development the simulated runoff volume capture ratios are 85 5 and 47 2 respectively considering the volume capture ratio goal of annual rainfall is only 80 and for the monitoring period the runoff volume capture ratio should be 86 3 a hypothetical lid design lid2 which can closely meet the goal with 86 runoff volume capture ratio for the monitoring period was proposed to make comparisons the four scenarios predevelopment post development existing lid application lid1 and a hypothetical lid design planning lid2 were modeled and comparisons were made under 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year storms respectively by application of the existing lid measures lid1 the volumetric runoff coefficient is reduced by 50 8 to 74 6 with better effects under smaller rainfall events as for the flood mitigation peak flow rate is a key indicator for scenario of lid1 the reduction ratio of peak flow is 72 3 to 87 5 under different design storm events compared to the effect on runoff volume reduction it seems that the use of lid measures was more efficient for peak flow rate reduction in terms of percentage reduction compared to the post development conditions moreover the lag time has been extended by lid measures the impact is more significant and apparent when the rainfall intensity is not high under relatively extreme storm events the impacts on lag time are smaller and less discernable for the lid2 application scenario which can just meet the sponge city goal the effect on managing stormwater under large storm events is quite limited for the runoff volume the reduction in volumetric runoff coefficient is about 0 1 0 2 compared to the post development conditions under different storm events e g reduction from 0 69 to 0 50 for the 2 year storm the effect on peak flow reduction is a little more remarkable with higher reduction ratio of peak flow rate by 34 0 to 56 3 e g reduction from 0 16 to 0 07 m3 s for the 2 year storm the corresponding lag time is extended by 7 to 15mins however the hypothetical lid planning doesn t have the capacity to reduce outflow volume and peak flow rate to that of the predevelopment condition and it is not enough to prevent the flooding taking reduction of runoff volume and peak flow rate under large storm events as the indexes series of lid3 design plans were designed and applied for the project in order to restore the natural hydrology for the mitigating the flooding problems and restoring the natural hydrology under larger storm events the runoff volume capture ratio during the monitoring period should be about 89 for the pilot project the goal of corresponding design precipitation and volume capture ratio of annual rainfall are 36 2 mm and 82 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare

6148,a new modeling approach was developed to facilitate simulations of soil water flow and energy transport during sporadic freezing thawing episodes typical for the winter regime of humid temperate continental climate the approach is based on an accurate non iterative algorithm for solving the highly non linear energy balance equation during phase transitions the new algorithm was successfully verified against the analytical solution for idealized freezing and thawing conditions two examples of the model application under hypothetical and real field conditions are given keywords soil freezing energy balance equation phase transition equivalent liquid water content finite element method numerical simulations 1 introduction the physically sound description of processes accompanying phase transitions during freezing and thawing of soil water is a task that has received growing attention in the recent literature the related studies focused on different aspects of the soil freezing phenomena addressing the impact of phase transitions on the soil thermal budget e g luo et al 2003 the snowmelt runoff enhancement by frozen soil conditions e g cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 the permafrost fate modeling e g riseborough et al 2008 the frost heaving effects e g peppin and style 2013 etc in soils pore water freezes over a relatively narrow range of temperatures below the freezing point of pure water 273 15 k at normal atmospheric pressure the relationship between freezing point depression and liquid water saturation of a particular soil can be described by a soil freezing curve soil freezing curves can be determined experimentally predicted based on the physics of liquid ice interface or estimated using empirical expressions the exact course of freezing curves is however difficult to determine with accuracy the shape of freezing curves is often predicted using the generalized clausius clapeyron equation koopmans and miller 1966 kay and groenevelt 1974 spaans and baker 1996 or gibbs thomson equation e g strange et al 1993 mitchell et al 2008 these equations predict the freezing point depression of about one degree celsius over the range of pore sizes from 1 mm to 0 1 µm the adequacy of these two equations leading to very similar predictive formulas is based on several simplifying assumptions i thermodynamic equilibrium at the ice liquid interface during phase transitions is assumed ii the ice pressure is usually approximated by atmospheric pressure iii the curvature of the ice liquid interface is assumed to be similar to the liquid air interface invoking the freezing drying analogy although these assumptions have been accepted as reasonable working hypotheses by most researchers some aspects of the underlying theory have been disputed for example the thermodynamic equilibrium at the soil freezing front was questioned by ma et al 2015 arguing that soil freezing may tend to be a non equilibrium irreversible thermodynamic process equating ice pressure with atmospheric pressure may be inappropriate in unsaturated soils where ice air interface exists in addition to ice liquid interface e g miller 1980 the freezing drying analogy assumption was criticized by hohmann 1997 who pointed out to the physical dissimilarity of the two processes as pointed out e g by mckenzie et al 2007 the shape of soil freezing curve is very important when apparent heat capacity concept e g harlan 1973 is used to formulate energy balance equation in freezing soil models the concept combines soil heat capacity with the slope of freezing curve the slope is obtained by differentiating the soil freezing function which is usually very steep thus dominating the resulting value of apparent heat capacity coefficient during phase transitions uncertainties associated with the determination of freezing curves propagate through this coefficient to the energy balance equation enhanced by the differentiation procedure which in turn negatively affects the accuracy of model predictions there is a strong experimental evidence that processes occurring at the ice liquid interface during freezing of soil water cause lowering of soil water potential which leads to the migration of water from unfrozen soil below freezing front toward the front the phenomenon often referred to as cryosuction taber 1930 coussy 2005 peppin and style 2013 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 additional depression of freezing point temperature and soil water potential at the freezing front can be caused by the presence of solutes in soil water e g petrenko and whitworth 1999 bittelli et al 2003 as dissolved salts are excluded from the ice phase and remain in the unfrozen liquid phase the supply of water toward the ice liquid interface may eventually lead to the formation of ice lenses and consequently to soil frost heaving however the magnitude of the water potential depression and thus the intensity of the water supply to the freezing front remains controversial black 1995 hohmann 1997 bronfenbrener and bronfenbrener 2010 groenevelt and grant 2013 it seems that a reliable quantitative description of the complex processes accompanying the effect of cryosuction is yet to be developed although some advances in this respect have been reported e g dall amico et al 2011 groenevelt and grant 2013 tubini et al 2017 increasingly numerical models of varying complexity are used to simulate the thermal balance and water balance of soils exposed to freezing important aspects in soil freezing modeling are the highly non linear nature of the energy balance equation during the phase transition and the coupling of thermal and mass balance equations describing energy and soil water fluxes to handle the transformations between sensible and latent heat during freezing thawing events the majority of existing models employ the concept of apparent heat capacity harlan 1973 fuchs et al 1978 rankinen et al 2004 hansson et al 2004 dall amico et al 2011 endrizzi et al 2014 as explained above the main disadvantage of this approach is that the apparent heat capacity increases by several orders of magnitude at the freezing point which complicates the numerical solution possibly causing numerical oscillations and convergence problems e g hansson et al 2004 dall amico et al 2011 a number of models include physically based soil freeze thaw routines of varying computational expense for example mckenzie et al 2007 modified u s geological survey s sutra computer code to simulate fully saturated coupled pore water and energy transport in northern peatlands their freezing model is based on the apparent heat capacity concept using empirical freezing functions to approximate the liquid water content versus freezing temperature relationship they neglect the effects of cryosuction and freezing point depression due to dissolved salts in the porewater similar approach was used in the land surface scheme of the community climate system model clm developed for simulations of permafrost dynamics as described in nicolsky et al 2007 the pan arctic water balance model pwbm includes an approach similar to the clm modified by rawlins et al 2013 in another study bense et al 2012 describe simulations with the generic finite element code flexpde designed to study the hydraulic regime of sub permafrost aquifer systems they assume that changes in water content in freezing soil proceed from full water saturation to full ice saturation following the freezing curve approximated by a smoothed step function between 0 c and 0 25 c and apply the apparent heat capacity concept to solve the heat flow equation a comprehensive review of soil freezing models is given e g in kurylyk and watanabe 2013 who provide both historical and comparative study of basic theoretical principles and modeling approaches the objectives of the present study are 1 to formulate a simplified yet physically sound approach for modeling water flow and energy transport in a variably saturated partially frozen soil applicable to episodic freezing conditions 2 to develop a reliable non iterative algorithm for solving the highly non linear energy balance equation 3 to verify the newly developed model against available analytical solutions of the energy balance equation and 4 to provide examples of the model application to numerical simulations of freezing thawing events 2 methods 2 1 basic pore space partitioning relationships the composition of soil is commonly expressed as a sum of volumetric fractions of individual soil constituents we consider five constituents 1 ε m ε o ε i ε w ε a 1 where m stands for mineral particles o for organic matter i for ice w for liquid water and a for air the mineral particles and organic matter constitute the soil matrix the soil pore volume is partitioned among three phases ice liquid water and air 2 ε i ε w ε a ϕ where ϕ is the porosity dimensionless further we assume that the soil matrix is rigid this makes the description of phase changes during soil freezing easier but at the same time it excludes some important phenomena accompanied by deformations of the soil matrix namely the frost heaving neglecting the presence of water vapor the mass balance of soil water in the pore space requires that 3 ρ i ε i ρ w ε w ρ w θ where θ is the equivalent liquid water content dimensionless ρi is the density of ice kg m 3 and ρw is the density of liquid water kg m 3 under the assumption of rigid soil it is useful to distinguish the water content at the liquid water saturation θ s w equal to the saturated water content of unfrozen soil θs and the equivalent liquid water content at the ice saturation θ s i 4 θ s w θ s ϕ θ s i ρ i ρ w ϕ in the present version of our model we assume that θ θ s i so that the soil is always sufficiently unsaturated to allow for the ice expansion 2 2 soil thermal properties thermal properties of soil are characterized by the heat capacity and the soil thermal conductivity the volumetric heat capacity of bulk soil can be evaluated based on the individual capacities of the soil constituents 5 c ε m c m ε o c o ε w c w for unfrozen soil ε m c m ε o c o ε i c i for frozen soil where cm co cw and ci are the volumetric heat capacities of mineral particles organic matter liquid water and ice j m 3 k 1 note that the contribution of liquid water heat capacity in frozen soil is in the present version of our model neglected the soil thermal conductivity depends not only on the conductivities and fractions of individual soil constituents but also on their distribution within the soil each soil thus exhibits a specific relationship between the water content and the thermal conductivity moreover when the water moves through the soil the heat advection has to be taken into account therefor the apparent soil thermal conductivity function is defined as 6 λ θ q λ e θ c w d q where λe θ is the thermal conductivity function w m 1 k 1 describing the λ θ relationship for variably saturated conditions d is the thermal dispersivity m which plays a similar role in the heat transport modeling as does the mechanical dispersivity in the solute transport modeling de marsily 1986 and q is the soil water flux m s 1 to approximate the thermal conductivity function we use the approach of côté and konrad 2005 7 λ e w θ λ dry λ sat w λ dry κ θ θ s w κ 1 θ 8 λ sat w λ m ε m λ o ε o λ w ϕ λ dry χ 10 η ϕ where λ dry and λ sat w are the soil thermal conductivities at dry and water saturated conditions w m 1 k 1 κ is an empirical parameter used to account for different textural soil classes dimensionless and χ w m 1 k 1 and η dimensionless are empirical parameters accounting for particle shape effects estimates of κ χ and η for basic types of soils can be found in côté and konrad 2005 based on the data published by côté and konrad 2005 we suggest the following simplified form of the λe θ function for frozen soil conditions 9 λ e i θ λ dry λ sat i λ dry θ θ s i λ sat i λ m ε m λ o ε o λ i ϕ an example of the parameterization of soil thermal conductivity function based on côté and konrad 2005 approach is given in section 4 2 table 2 2 3 model assumptions following simplifying assumptions are made in the present version of our model 1 soil is rigid no soil heaving due to ice expansion is allowed 2 the freezing point depression of soil water is neglected soil water freezes and thaws at the temperature of 273 15 k this assumption also means that the soil freezing function is approximated by a step function with infinite slope infinite slope can be applied because we do not use the concept of apparent heat capacity to formulate energy balance equation 3 liquid water in frozen soil is immobile and its amount is negligible this assumption could be relaxed by including unfrozen residual water content in frozen soil e g to improve the accuracy of frozen soil heat capacity estimation in soils with large residual water content e g clayey soils 4 soil water potential depression at the freezing front caused by interfacial forces and or solute expulsion is neglected consequently the phenomenon of cryosuction is not accounted for the above set of assumptions clearly limits the applicability of our model nevertheless we believe that there is a class of problems for which it might be beneficial to use a simplified solution rather than more complex solutions requiring large amount of additional information often loaded with considerable experimental and or theoretical uncertainty 2 4 energy balance in a soil system exposed to freezing thawing conditions a significant amount of energy is transferred between sensible and latent heat which together contribute to the internal energy of the system the internal energy can be expressed as 10 u θ t ε w u θ t 0 0 l ε w c θ t t t 0 where u is the internal energy of bulk soil j m 3 l is the product of the specific latent heat of fusion and liquid water density j m 3 εw is the liquid water content dimensionless t is the temperature k t 0 is the freezing point temperature equal to 273 15 k as we are interested only in changes of u and not in absolute values it is convenient to assume that the internal energy of frozen soil at t 0 is equal to zero or more precisely that u θ t 0 0 0 the volumetric heat capacity can be expressed as a linear function of equivalent liquid water content for temperatures above as well as below the freezing point i e for fully unfrozen or fully frozen soil 11 c θ t ε m c m ε o c o θ c w c θ t t 0 ε m c m ε o c o ρ w ρ i θ c i c θ t t 0 the value of c at t 0 is not needed to evaluate u from eq 10 as the second term on the right hand side of the equation is equal to zero for t t 0 in fact the heat capacity is undefined at the freezing point during phase transitions however we can assume that c θ t 0 is equal to either c θ or c θ depending on whether t 0 is approached from the above freezing temperatures or below freezing temperatures the local balance of internal energy in a soil system requires that 12 u t j l z j h z s l s h where jl is the flux of latent heat w m 2 jh is the flux of sensible heat w m 2 sl and sh are the sinks of latent and sensible heat due to the uptake of water by plant roots w m 3 the latent and sensible heat fluxes are expressed as 13 j l q l j h q c w t t 0 λ t z the latent and sensible heat sinks are specified as 14 s l s w l s h s w c w t t 0 where sw is the root water uptake intensity s 1 after substituting 10 13 and 14 into 12 and assuming that the equivalent liquid

that freezing of fully or partially saturated soil proceeds from water in large pores to progressively smaller ones fig 1 due to the freezing point depression a small amount of water in frozen soil remains unfrozen even at temperatures well below 273 15 k in our simplified modeling approach we assume the amount and mobility of such water negligible consequently the soil water flow is limited to unfrozen soil only under specific conditions liquid water can also enter air filled pores of partly saturated frozen soil e g during rain on frozen soil events such conditions are dealt with in our model by introducing a separate preferential flow domain see the example problem presented in section 4 2 2 6 numerical solution of energy balance the numerical solution of the energy balance eq 17 has been implemented into the flow and transport code s1d vogel et al 2010 2011 the solution is based on the finite element method which approximates the governing partial differential equation with a set of algebraic equations the main challenge in solving this set of equations is associated with its strong nonlinearity during phase transition the nonlinearity is a direct consequence of the abrupt change of internal energy as a function of temperature at the freezing point fig 2 in most if not all existing codes the nonlinear set of algebraic equations is solved iteratively which makes the resulting algorithm computationally expensive and prone to problems with convergence in what follows we introduce a robust non iterative solution we assume that the soil profile can be divided into

17 results in a set of algebraic equations which needs to be solved for nodal temperatures at each time step this set can be expressed as a tridiagonal matrix system the n th row of the system can be written as 23 a 1 n t n 1 a 2 n t n a 3 n t n 1 b n q n where a and b are coefficients computed from the local soil thermal properties and soil water fluxes i e from nodal values of c cw λ q and sw and qn is the nodal value of sink source of internal energy due to the phase transition if a nodal value of internal energy un calculated from eq 22 drops below lθ by cooling of unfrozen soil or rises above zero by warming of frozen soil at any nodal point n cf fig 2 the coefficients of n th row of the matrix system are stored and replaced by dummy values denoted by asterisk to force the matrix solver to produce tn t 0 24 a 1 n 0 a 2 n 1 a 3 n 0 b n t 0 q n 0 this operation removes the phase transition singularity from the system the resulting set of equations is linear and can be solved to yield the vector of unknown nodal temperatures tn the original previously stored and replaced coefficients are then used to evaluate qn after that the values of qn are used to determine the changes of liquid water content εw caused by the phase transition at each nodal point of the freezing thawing zone cf eq 19 25 δ ε w δ t n ρ i ρ w δ ε i δ t n q n l the resulting nodal values of liquid water content are then used to update the values of un eq 22 and the algorithm proceeds to the next time step 3 model verification 3 1 freezing the freezing branch of our algorithm was verified against the analytical solution developed for a semi infinite water column neumann 1860 in weber 1901 the initial temperature of the column was assumed to be 2 c the boundary temperature at the freezing end of the column was set equal to 5 c the solution deals with the freezing of pure water therefore the soil porosity was set equal to 1 the model results are compared with the analytical solution in fig 3 the figure suggests a very good agreement between the two solutions 3 2 thawing the penetration of thawing front into an initially frozen semi infinite column of a saturated soil as a result of a sudden increase in surface temperature was solved analytically by neumann in weber 1901 his solution was used to verify the thawing branch of our algorithm the initial temperature of 5 c porosity of 0 5 and boundary temperature of 5 c were applied the results of the numerical model are compared with the analytical solution in fig 4 the figure shows that the depth to thawing front predicted by the numerical model is in a very strong agreement with the analytical solution 4 model application 4 1 hypothetical freezing thawing event the following example problem deals with the numerical simulation of a hypothetical freezing thawing event occurring over a period of 24 days the soil profile is homogeneous 2 m deep consisting of a sandy loam soil the soil hydraulic and thermal properties correspond to a real soil the second layer in table 1 the simulation starts with a uniform distribution of temperature in the soil profile the initial temperature is set equal to 5 c at the time zero the surface temperature drops down to 5 c and then stays constant over the period of 10 days after 10 days the surface temperature increases back to 5 c and remains constant over the rest of the simulated period as shown in fig 5 our model predicts a sharp freezing front separating the frozen soil above from the unfrozen soil below the front during the initial 10 day period the freezing front advances to a depth of 30 cm next the surface temperature increases above the freezing point initiating the thawing phase of the event during the thawing phase two thawing fronts develop as the frozen soil warms up by heat conducted from the soil surface as well as from the deeper unfrozen part of the soil profile the frozen soil between the two thawing fronts is quickly brought close to the freezing point the thawing phase ends 10 days after the surface temperature reversal when the two thawing fronts meet 4 2 episodic soil freezing in a mountain catchment the above described model was used to simulate winter thermal conditions at a meadow site of a mountain catchment the site is situated in the liz catchment a small catchment belonging to the headwater area of the otava river basin located in the bohemian forest czech republic hydraulic and thermal properties of the soil of interest sandy loam developed on paragneiss bedrock classified as eutric cambisol were adopted from votrubova et al 2012 while simplifying the description to three distinct layers as provided in tables 1 and 2 the simulated soil profile was five meters deep discretized with one cm step the soil surface boundary condition was constructed using a simple snow cover model precipitation was considered liquid if the air temperature was not freezing snowmelt was approximated with a simple degree day method melting occurred if the air temperature exceeded 0 1 c a sine wave was used to mimic the melt factor annual variation between 0 05 and 0 25 cm c 1 day 1 the melt factor values were optimized to capture the snow disappearance time deduced from the albedo observations the liquid precipitation and the snowmelt intensities were used to define the upper boundary condition of the soil water flow model fig 6 a the bottom boundary condition was set according to the average specific discharge of the catchment 0 09 cm day 1 the soil temperature at the upper boundary was derived from the temperature measured 10 cm above the soil surface missing data for few days in december were substituted with the observations from previous and or next days for no snow conditions soil surface temperature was set equal to the air temperature measured 10 cm above ground in case of snow cover this air temperature was adjusted the soil surface temperature was kept below zero above zero temperatures observed above shallow snow cover were not considered and to account for the expected temperature attenuation due to the snow cover temperature fluctuations below zero were reduced in our case dividing by two provided pleasing results constant temperature of 9 c was set at the bottom of the simulated soil profile the s1d model was used in a dual continuum mode to allow snow melt water to infiltrate passing the frozen soil matrix layer the preferential flow domain was assumed to be unaffected by water phase changes i e remained fully conductive during freezing episodes fig 6b illustrates that the model can reproduce the soil freeze thaw cycle reasonably well the seasonal variation of the soil temperature near the soil surface is captured including timing of the soil thawing in spring manifested by the soil temperature beginning to follow diurnal variations of the air temperature in a detail view the diurnal temperature variations in unfrozen soil are underestimated this discrepancy is likely related to the inaccurate boundary condition as the surface temperature daily amplitudes are probably bigger than those measured 10 cm above the surface on the other hand when the soil becomes frozen the diurnal temperature variations are overestimated this is probably due to the imperfect model representation of the soil surface layer thermal properties under frozen conditions our assumption of negligible residual liquid water saturation may result in thermal conductivity overestimation in the highly rooted surface layer moreover unlike the observation the model indicates soil thawing in january this could again be caused by the unrealistic boundary condition i e by the near surface air temperature being not an adequate proxy for the soil surface temperature 5 summary and conclusions a new modeling approach was developed to facilitate the simulations of soil water flow and energy transport during sporadic freezing thawing episodes which are typical for the winter regime of humid temperate continental climate the approach is based on an accurate non iterative algorithm for solving highly non linear energy balance equation during the phase transitions the suggested modeling approach abstracts from many complexities associated with the freezing phenomena in soils yet preserves the principal physical mechanism of conserving the internal energy of the soil system during the phase transitions when applied to simulate occasional freezing soil conditions the model algorithm delivers the desired effect of slowing down the propagation of surface freezing temperatures into deeper soil horizons by converting water latent heat into sensible heat the model also allows the evaluation of the extent and duration of frozen soil conditions a crucial information for soil water flow modeling as the frozen soil significantly reduces the soil hydraulic conductivity the new algorithm was successfully verified against analytical solutions for idealized freezing and thawing conditions two examples of the model application under hypothetical and real field conditions were given the latter example shows that the model is capable

freezing energy balance equation phase transition equivalent liquid water content finite element method numerical simulations 1 introduction the physically sound description of processes accompanying phase transitions during freezing and thawing of soil water is a task that has received growing attention in the recent literature the related studies focused on different aspects of the soil freezing phenomena addressing the impact of phase transitions on the soil thermal budget e g luo et al 2003 the snowmelt runoff enhancement by frozen soil conditions e g cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 the permafrost fate modeling e g riseborough et al 2008 the frost heaving effects e g peppin and style 2013 etc in soils pore water freezes over a relatively narrow range of temperatures below the freezing point of pure water 273 15 k at normal atmospheric pressure the relationship between freezing point depression and liquid water saturation of a particular soil can be described by a soil freezing curve soil freezing curves can be determined experimentally predicted based on the physics of liquid ice interface or estimated using empirical expressions the exact course of freezing curves is however difficult to determine with accuracy the shape of freezing curves is often predicted using the generalized clausius clapeyron equation koopmans and miller 1966 kay and groenevelt 1974 spaans and baker 1996 or gibbs thomson equation e g strange et al 1993 mitchell et al 2008 these equations predict the freezing point depression of about one degree celsius over the range of pore sizes from 1 mm to 0 1 µm the adequacy of these two equations leading to very similar predictive formulas is based on several simplifying assumptions i thermodynamic equilibrium at the ice liquid interface during phase transitions is assumed ii the ice pressure is usually approximated by atmospheric pressure iii the curvature of the ice liquid interface is assumed to be similar to the liquid air interface invoking the freezing drying analogy although these assumptions have been accepted as reasonable working hypotheses by most researchers some aspects of the underlying theory have been disputed for example the thermodynamic equilibrium at the soil freezing front was questioned by ma et al 2015 arguing that soil freezing may tend to be a non equilibrium irreversible thermodynamic process equating ice pressure with atmospheric pressure may be inappropriate in unsaturated soils where ice air interface exists in addition to ice liquid interface e g miller 1980 the freezing drying analogy assumption was criticized by hohmann 1997 who pointed out to the physical dissimilarity of the two processes as pointed out e g by mckenzie et al 2007 the shape of soil freezing curve is very important when apparent heat capacity concept e g harlan 1973 is used to formulate energy balance equation in freezing soil models the concept combines soil heat capacity with the slope of freezing curve the slope is obtained by differentiating the soil freezing function which is usually very steep thus dominating the resulting value of apparent heat capacity coefficient during phase transitions uncertainties associated with the determination of freezing curves propagate through this coefficient to the energy balance equation enhanced by the differentiation procedure which in turn negatively affects the accuracy of model predictions there is a strong experimental evidence that processes occurring at the ice liquid interface during freezing of soil water cause lowering of soil water potential which leads to the migration of water from unfrozen soil below freezing front toward the front the phenomenon often referred to as cryosuction taber 1930 coussy 2005 peppin and style 2013 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 additional depression of freezing point temperature and soil water potential at the freezing front can be caused by the presence of solutes in soil water e g petrenko and whitworth 1999 bittelli et al 2003 as dissolved salts are excluded from the ice phase and remain in the unfrozen liquid phase the supply of water toward the ice liquid interface may eventually lead to the formation of ice lenses and consequently to soil frost heaving however the magnitude of the water potential depression and thus the intensity of the water supply to the freezing front remains controversial black 1995 hohmann 1997 bronfenbrener and bronfenbrener 2010 groenevelt and grant 2013 it seems that a reliable quantitative description of the complex processes accompanying the effect of cryosuction is yet to be developed although some advances in this respect have been reported e g dall amico et al 2011 groenevelt and grant 2013 tubini et al 2017 increasingly numerical models of varying complexity are used to simulate the thermal balance and water balance of soils exposed to freezing important aspects in soil freezing modeling are the highly non linear nature of the energy balance equation during the phase transition and the coupling of thermal and mass balance equations describing energy and soil water fluxes to handle the transformations between sensible and latent heat during freezing thawing events the majority of existing models employ the concept of apparent heat capacity harlan 1973 fuchs et al 1978 rankinen et al 2004 hansson et al 2004 dall amico et al 2011 endrizzi et al 2014 as explained above the main disadvantage of this approach is that the apparent heat capacity increases by several orders of magnitude at the freezing point which complicates the numerical solution possibly causing numerical oscillations and convergence problems e g hansson et al 2004 dall amico et al 2011 a number of models include physically based soil freeze thaw routines of varying computational expense for example mckenzie et al 2007 modified u s geological survey s sutra computer code to simulate fully saturated coupled pore water and energy transport in northern peatlands their freezing model is based on the apparent heat capacity concept using empirical freezing functions to approximate the liquid water content versus freezing temperature relationship they neglect the effects of cryosuction and freezing point depression due to dissolved salts in the porewater similar approach was used in the land surface scheme of the community climate system model clm developed for simulations of permafrost dynamics as described in nicolsky et al 2007 the pan arctic water balance model pwbm includes an approach similar to the clm modified by rawlins et al 2013 in another study bense et al 2012 describe simulations with the generic finite element code flexpde designed to study the hydraulic regime of sub permafrost aquifer systems they assume that changes in water content in freezing soil proceed from full water saturation to full ice saturation following the freezing curve approximated by a smoothed step function between 0 c and 0 25 c and apply the apparent heat capacity concept to solve the heat flow equation a comprehensive review of soil freezing models is given e g in kurylyk and watanabe 2013 who provide both historical and comparative study of basic theoretical principles and modeling approaches the objectives of the present study are 1 to formulate a simplified yet physically sound approach for modeling water flow and energy transport in a variably saturated partially frozen soil applicable to episodic freezing conditions 2 to develop a reliable non iterative algorithm for solving the highly non linear energy balance equation 3 to verify the newly developed model against available analytical solutions of the energy balance equation and 4 to provide examples of the model application to numerical simulations of freezing thawing events 2 methods 2 1 basic pore space partitioning relationships the composition of soil is commonly expressed as a sum of volumetric fractions of individual soil constituents we consider five constituents 1 ε m ε o ε i ε w ε a 1 where m stands for mineral particles o for organic matter i for ice w for liquid water and a for air the mineral particles and organic matter constitute the soil matrix the soil pore volume is partitioned among three phases ice liquid water and air 2 ε i ε w ε a ϕ where ϕ is the porosity dimensionless further we assume that the soil matrix is rigid this makes the description of phase changes during soil freezing easier but at the same time it excludes some important phenomena accompanied by deformations of the soil matrix namely the frost heaving neglecting the presence of water vapor the mass balance of soil water in the pore space requires that 3 ρ i ε i ρ w ε w ρ w θ where θ is the equivalent liquid water content dimensionless ρi is the density of ice kg m 3 and ρw is the density of liquid water kg m 3 under the assumption of rigid soil it is useful to distinguish the water content at the liquid water saturation θ s w equal to the saturated water content of unfrozen soil θs and the equivalent liquid water content at the ice saturation θ s i 4 θ s w θ s ϕ θ s i ρ i ρ w ϕ in the present version of our model we assume that θ θ s i so that the soil is always sufficiently unsaturated to allow for the ice expansion 2 2 soil thermal properties thermal properties of soil are characterized by the heat capacity and the soil thermal conductivity the volumetric heat capacity of bulk soil can be evaluated based on the individual capacities of the soil constituents 5 c ε m c m ε o c o ε w c w for unfrozen soil ε m c m ε o c o ε i c i for frozen soil where cm co cw and ci are the volumetric heat capacities of mineral particles organic matter liquid water and ice j m 3 k 1 note that the contribution of liquid water heat capacity in frozen soil is in the present version of our model neglected the soil thermal conductivity depends not only on the conductivities and fractions of individual soil constituents but also on their distribution within the soil each soil thus exhibits a specific relationship between the water content and the thermal conductivity moreover when the water moves through the soil the heat advection has to be taken into account therefor the apparent soil thermal conductivity function is defined as 6 λ θ q λ e θ c w d q where λe θ is the thermal conductivity function w m 1 k 1 describing the λ θ relationship for variably saturated conditions d is the thermal dispersivity m which plays a similar role in the heat transport modeling as does the mechanical dispersivity in the solute transport modeling de marsily 1986 and q is the soil water flux m s 1 to approximate the thermal conductivity function we use the approach of côté and konrad 2005 7 λ e w θ λ dry λ sat w λ dry κ θ θ s w κ 1 θ 8 λ sat w λ m ε m λ o ε o λ w ϕ λ dry χ 10 η ϕ where λ dry and λ sat w are the soil thermal conductivities at dry and water saturated conditions w m 1 k 1 κ is an empirical parameter used to account for different textural soil classes dimensionless and χ w m 1 k 1 and η dimensionless are empirical parameters accounting for particle shape effects estimates of κ χ and η for basic types of soils can be found in côté and konrad 2005 based on the data published by côté and konrad 2005 we suggest the following simplified form of the λe θ function for frozen soil conditions 9 λ e i θ λ dry λ sat i λ dry θ θ s i λ sat i λ m ε m λ o ε o λ i ϕ an example of the parameterization of soil thermal conductivity function based on côté and konrad 2005 approach is given in section 4 2 table 2 2 3 model assumptions following simplifying assumptions are made in the present version of our model 1 soil is rigid no soil heaving due to ice expansion is allowed 2 the freezing point depression of soil water is neglected soil water freezes and thaws at the temperature of 273 15 k this assumption also means that the soil freezing function is approximated by a step function with infinite slope infinite slope can be applied because we do not use the concept of apparent heat capacity to formulate energy balance equation 3 liquid water in frozen soil is immobile and its amount is negligible this assumption could be relaxed by including unfrozen residual water content in frozen soil e g to improve the accuracy of frozen soil heat capacity estimation in soils with large residual water content e g clayey soils 4 soil water potential depression at the freezing front caused by interfacial forces and or solute expulsion is neglected consequently the phenomenon of cryosuction is not accounted for the above set of assumptions clearly limits the applicability of our model nevertheless we believe that there is a class of problems for which it might be beneficial to use a simplified solution rather than more complex solutions requiring large amount of additional information often loaded with considerable experimental and or theoretical uncertainty 2 4 energy balance in a soil system exposed to freezing thawing conditions a significant amount of energy is transferred between sensible and latent heat which together contribute to the internal energy of the system the internal energy can be expressed as 10 u θ t ε w u θ t 0 0 l ε w c θ t t t 0 where u is the internal energy of bulk soil j m 3 l is the product of the specific latent heat of fusion and liquid water density j m 3 εw is the liquid water content dimensionless t is the temperature k t 0 is the freezing point temperature equal to 273 15 k as we are interested only in changes of u and not in absolute values it is convenient to assume that the internal energy of frozen soil at t 0 is equal to zero or more precisely that u θ t 0 0 0 the volumetric heat capacity can be expressed as a linear function of equivalent liquid water content for temperatures above as well as below the freezing point i e for fully unfrozen or fully frozen soil 11 c θ t ε m c m ε o c o θ c w c θ t t 0 ε m c m ε o c o ρ w ρ i θ c i c θ t t 0 the value of c at t 0 is not needed to evaluate u from eq 10 as the second term on the right hand side of the equation is equal to zero for t t 0 in fact the heat capacity is undefined at the freezing point during phase transitions however we can assume that c θ t 0 is equal to either c θ or c θ depending on whether t 0 is approached from the above freezing temperatures or below freezing temperatures the local balance of internal energy in a soil system requires that 12 u t j l z j h z s l s h where jl is the flux of latent heat w m 2 jh is the flux of sensible heat w m 2 sl and sh are the sinks of latent and sensible heat due to the uptake of water by plant roots w m 3 the latent and sensible heat fluxes are expressed as 13 j l q l j h q c w t t 0 λ t z the latent and sensible heat sinks are specified as 14 s l s w l s h s w c w t t 0 where sw is the root water uptake intensity s 1 after substituting 10 13 and 14 into 12 and assuming that the equivalent liquid water content does not change with time when t t 0 15 l ε w t c t t c w t 0 θ t c w q t z c w t 0 q z z λ t z l q z s w l s w c w t s w c w t 0 the terms involving t 0 i e the third and fifth term on the left hand side together with the third term on the right hand side cancel out due to the equivalent liquid water balance the equation then becomes 16 l ε w t c t t c w q t z z λ t z l q z s w l s w c w t the resulting energy balance equation can be decomposed into separate balance equations of sensible and latent heat 17 c t t c w q t z z λ t z s w c w t q 18 l ε w t l q z s w l q where q is the sink source of internal energy j m 3 s 1 due to the phase transition sink in the sensible heat balance 17 represents source in the latent heat balance 18 and vice versa the value of q is positive for melting and negative for freezing the magnitude of q is determined by the rate of the phase change 19 q ρ i ρ w l ε i t note that eqs 18 and 19 can also be interpreted as the mass balance equations for liquid and frozen water 2 5 soil water flow alternatively the mass balance of soil water can be written in terms of the equivalent liquid water content 20 θ t q z s w 0 note that 20 can be obtained by combining 18 19 and 3 to describe the flow of soil water the mass balance equation needs to be complemented with an appropriate momentum balance equation and corresponding constitutive relationships in case of the unfrozen soil this role is played by the darcy buckingham equation and the functions representing soil hydraulic properties the soil water retention function θ h and the hydraulic conductivity function k h 21 q k h h z 1 θ θ h k k h where h is the soil water pressure head m for freezing thawing conditions the situation becomes more complicated it is common to assume that freezing of fully or partially saturated soil proceeds from water in large pores to progressively smaller ones fig 1 due to the freezing point depression a small amount of water in frozen soil remains unfrozen even at temperatures well below 273 15 k in our simplified modeling approach we assume the amount and mobility of such water negligible consequently the soil water flow is limited to unfrozen soil only under specific conditions liquid water can also enter air filled pores of partly saturated frozen soil e g during rain on frozen soil events such conditions are dealt with in our model by introducing a separate preferential flow domain see the example problem presented in section 4 2 2 6 numerical solution of energy balance the numerical solution of the energy balance eq 17 has been implemented into the flow and transport code s1d vogel et al 2010 2011 the solution is based on the finite element method which approximates the governing partial differential equation with a set of algebraic equations the main challenge in solving this set of equations is associated with its strong nonlinearity during phase transition the nonlinearity is a direct consequence of the abrupt change of internal energy as a function of temperature at the freezing point fig 2 in most if not all existing codes the nonlinear set of algebraic equations is solved iteratively which makes the resulting algorithm computationally expensive and prone to problems with convergence in what follows we introduce a robust non iterative solution we assume that the soil profile can be divided into three zones 1 frozen soil 2 freezing thawing soil and 3 unfrozen soil these zones are characterized by distinct internal energy regimes 22 u c t t 0 t t 0 l ε w t t 0 l θ c t t 0 t t 0 an important aspect which allows us to solve the energy balance equation by a non iterative procedure is that the freezing thawing zone in the soil profile stays at the constant temperature t 0 during phase

written as 23 a 1 n t n 1 a 2 n t n a 3 n t n 1 b n q n where a and b are coefficients computed from the local soil thermal properties and soil water fluxes i e from nodal values of c cw λ q and sw and qn is the nodal value of sink source of internal energy due to the phase transition if a nodal value of internal energy un calculated from eq 22 drops below lθ by cooling of unfrozen soil or rises above zero by warming of frozen soil at any nodal point n cf fig 2 the coefficients of n th row of the matrix system are stored and replaced by dummy values denoted by asterisk to force the matrix

optimized to capture the snow disappearance time deduced from the albedo observations the liquid precipitation and the snowmelt intensities were used to define the upper boundary condition of the soil water flow model fig 6 a the bottom boundary condition was set according to the average specific discharge of the catchment 0 09 cm day 1 the soil temperature at the upper boundary was derived from the temperature measured 10 cm above the soil surface missing data for few days in december were substituted with the observations from previous and or next days for no snow conditions soil surface temperature was set equal to the air temperature measured 10 cm above ground in case of snow cover this air temperature was adjusted the soil surface temperature was kept below zero above zero temperatures observed above shallow snow cover were not considered and to account for the expected temperature attenuation due to the snow cover temperature fluctuations below zero were reduced in our case dividing by two provided pleasing results constant temperature of 9 c was set at the bottom of the simulated soil profile the s1d model was used in a dual continuum mode to allow snow melt water to infiltrate passing the frozen soil matrix layer the preferential flow domain was assumed to be unaffected by water phase changes i e remained fully conductive during freezing episodes fig 6b illustrates that the model can reproduce the soil freeze thaw cycle reasonably well the seasonal variation of the soil temperature near the soil surface is captured including timing of the soil thawing in spring manifested by the soil temperature beginning to follow diurnal variations of the air temperature in a detail view the diurnal temperature variations in unfrozen soil are underestimated this discrepancy is likely related to the inaccurate boundary condition as the surface temperature daily amplitudes are probably bigger than those measured 10 cm above the surface on the other hand when the soil becomes frozen the diurnal temperature variations are overestimated this is probably due to the imperfect model representation of the soil surface layer thermal properties under frozen conditions our assumption of negligible residual liquid water saturation may result in thermal conductivity overestimation in the highly rooted surface layer moreover unlike the observation the model indicates soil thawing in january this could again be caused by the unrealistic boundary condition i e by the near surface air temperature being not an adequate proxy for the soil surface temperature 5 summary and conclusions a new modeling approach was developed to facilitate the simulations of soil water flow and energy transport during sporadic freezing thawing episodes which are typical for the winter regime of humid temperate continental climate the approach is based on an accurate non iterative algorithm for solving highly non linear energy balance equation during the phase transitions the suggested modeling approach abstracts from many complexities associated with the freezing phenomena in soils yet preserves the principal physical mechanism of conserving the internal energy of the soil system during the phase transitions when applied to simulate occasional freezing soil conditions the model algorithm delivers the desired effect of slowing down the propagation of surface freezing temperatures into deeper soil horizons by converting water latent heat into sensible heat the model also allows the evaluation of the extent and duration of frozen soil conditions a crucial information for soil water flow modeling as the frozen soil significantly reduces the soil hydraulic conductivity the new algorithm was successfully verified against analytical solutions for idealized freezing and thawing conditions two examples of the model application under hypothetical and real field conditions were given the latter example shows that the model is capable of simulating transient freezing thawing episodes and predicting the winter soil thermal regime at the site of interest declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

6149,predictability of groundwater flow and transport models greatly relies on adequate characterization of aquifer heterogeneity such as hydraulic conductivity k porosity ϕ etc the traditional model combining archie formula and kozeny carman equation thus called akc model in this study has been proven in a large number of studies to be helpful in evaluation of k through electrical resistivity r e however akc model does not take into account the widely reported dependence of k on depth thus often fails in deep formations 100 m as was observed in our study in order to consider the impact of depth on the k r e relation a new model called lakc model was introduced which combined louis decay model with akc model the effectiveness of lakc model was verified against k measurements from stratified pumping tests and applied in a real aquifer in northern ordos basin china the results revealed that lakc model can characterize the depth dependent k r e relation properly and that calibrated lakc model is capable of providing adequate k estimates based on detailed r e measurements in a similar context of lithology keywords aquifer characterization electrical resistivity northern ordos basin depth dependence stratified pumping test 1 introduction regional groundwater flow is critical to understand various geologic processes such as fluid flow in sedimentary basins jiang et al 2009 wang et al 2011 surface ground water interaction winter 1978 heat and solute transport cardenas 2007 niederau et al 2017 etc aquifer heterogeneity is one of the key factors of properly modeling groundwater flow and solute transport unfortunately due to technical and financial limitations it is extremely impractical to reveal the spatial variability of real aquifers using traditional approaches like pumping tests and drilling binley et al 2015 nan and wu 2017 yeh and liu 2000 it is still challenging for hydrogeologists to collect sufficient and reliable information to infer aquifer heterogeneity such as detailed distributions of hydraulic parameters e g hydraulic conductivity k and porosity ϕ the predictability and reliability of groundwater models especially those of solute migration can thus be significantly undermined in highly heterogeneous media mizukami et al 2017 nan et al 2019 yoon et al 2013 zheng et al 2011 in recent decades the emergence of and advances in hydrogeophysics have made it possible to collect information of aquifer heterogeneity with growing amounts and accuracy and even to estimate hydraulic parameters quantitatively dhakate and singh 2005 frohlich 1994 niwas and de lima 2003 rezaei et al 2016 zakari et al 2015 the geophysical approaches provide fast and effective technical supports for aquifer exploration and evaluation and have become alternatives to traditional hydrogeological approaches to obtain hydrogeological parameters binley et al 2015 singh 2005 the similarity between ohm s law and darcy s law as well as linkage between geoelectric and hydraulic properties of formations made it possible to estimate hydrogeological parameters through geoelectric methods louis et al 2004 there have been many studies on the relationship between electrical resistivity r e and hydrogeological parameters in sandy media among which the archie formula had been accepted by many researchers archie 1942 dick et al 2018 robinson et al 2012 singha and gorelick 2006 whitman and yeboah forson 2015 yeh et al 2002 zha et al 2017 in a large number of studies r e obtained by geophysical methods were converted into hydraulic conductivity k through a model combining archie equation and kozeny carman equation termed akc model for brevity and the performance of akc model was acceptable in shallow formations kazakis et al 2016 niwas and celik 2012 sikandar and christen 2012 though in near surface environments 1km heterogeneity e g lithofacies is a controlling factor of permeability or equivalently k gleeson et al 2011 ranjram et al 2014 permeability and k were also found dependent on locale depth in fact a number of studies demonstrated that permeability generally decays with depth jiang et al 2009 louis 1974 manning and ingebritsen 1999 ranjram et al 2014 snow 1968 wang et al 2009 such decay behaviors can be remarkable in thick aquifers and significantly change the conditions of regional groundwater flow systems jiang et al 2010 saar and magna 2004 zhao 1998 but quantitative descriptions of depth related decay is still limited sanford 2017 there were studies on depth s impact on permeability through empirical or semi empirical methods see jiang et al 2011 kuang and jiao 2014 and references therein to describe the general relationship between permeability and depth a few models were proposed among which two major types were widely used i e the power law model bredehoeft et al 1992 ingebritsen and manning 2002 2010 manning and ingebritsen 1999 stober and bucher 2007 and the exponential model jiang et al 2010 louis 1974 saar and magna 2004 williams and narasimhan 1989 these models were aimed to a general rule of depth permeability relation so that intrinsic heterogeneity of medium such as lithofacies was ignored and variations in observed permeability data in a large range of depth were fully attributed to depth kuang and jiao 2014 in thick and highly heterogeneous aquifers it is better to take into account the impacts of both formation heterogeneity and depth in this paper we develop a depth dependent k r e model which combines a depth permeability model of louis 1974 exponential type and widely used akc model hence the proposed model is called lakc model rather than analyzing the impact of gravity stress depth on each akc parameter or intermediate separately a lumped exponential function is used to fully account for gravity impact to the final k estimates our goal is to consider the impacts of aquifer heterogeneity and depth simultaneously so that k in thick regional aquifers can be estimated by r e measurements collected by geophysical methods in a parsimonious manner to analyze the applicability of lakc model we investigate the performance of lakc model in a cross validation experiment based on k and r e measurements collected in three boreholes of depth 700 m in a thick aquifer that is lakc model is calibrated via pest code using measurements from any two boreholes and validated using measurements from the third borehole to demonstrate the necessity of including depth dependence akc model is also applied in a similar procedure and compared to lakc model after validation of lakc model we apply it in estimating detailed k values from 5 cm spacing r e data throughout the boreholes this paper is structured as follows section 2 explains akc model lakc model and calibration procedures section 3 presents the information of the study area and available data in section 4 we analyze the predictability of lakc model in a cross validation experiment compared to akc model and apply lakc model throughout depth to obtain detailed k distributions and discuss depth dependency of effective porosity section 5 provides a summary and the main conclusions 2 study area and available data the hydrogeological exploration boreholes zkh5 zkh2 and zkh3 in this study are located in the middle and low desert plain of wushenqi area the lake concentrated area in northern ordos basin china fig 1 the strata in this area are almost horizontal and all the strata are terrigenous clastic deposits the hydrogeological profile of the study area is shown in fig 2 the aquifer under study mainly consists of lower cretaceous luohe formation k1 l and lower cretaceous huanhe formation k1 h the lithofacies are semi cemented siltstone fine medium coarse sandstone gritstone and sandwiched silty mudstone with well developed pores and low shale content at the top is discontinuously distributed quaternary holocene aeolian sand layer q4 eol thickness 10 m the underlying formation below k1 l is jurassic anding formation j2 a depth 800 m in most areas consisting of low permeability dense fine sandstone and pelite since no continuous aquifuge layer exists above j2 a the formations within 800 m deep can be treated as a unified aquifer of large thickness over 800 m yin et al 2011 the total depths of boreholes zkh2 zkh3 and zkh5 are 958 m 703 m and 753 m respectively three boreholes expose quaternary holocene aeolian sand layer q4 eol at depth 0 m 0 10 m and 0 1 6 m respectively huanhe formation k1 h is found in the three boreholes at 0 474 m 10 330 m and 1 6 574 m respectively luohe formation k1 l are 474 880 m 330 701 m and 574 753 m respectively anding formation j2 a is exposed by zkh2 and zkh3 at 880 m and 701 m see fig 2 in this study xskc 92 logging instrument was used for well logging by using this instrument the borehole temperature and measured resistivity r 0 values of depth 5 700 m were collected from zkh5 zkh2 and zkh3 boreholes with electrode space equal to 5 cm the range of temperature in three boreholes at all depths are 19 30 c and the average is about 24 c considering the influence of ground temperature variation on r 0 within 700 m depth the temperature correction for r 0 is carried out by arps formula arps 1953 1 r e t 0 21 5 t e 21 5 r 0 where t 0 c is the borehole temperature r 0 ω m is the measured resistivity and r e ω m is the electrical resistivity at a base line temperature t e equal to average temperature in three boreholes stratified pumping tests based on solexperts heavy duty double packer system hddp were conducted in 44 borehole segments of length 20 m or 50 m hddp is a set of drilling water sample acquisition system consisting of two balloon embolisms packers in this method two packers were inflated with high pressure nitrogen and in close contact with the well wall to produce water stopping effect the non target sections at both ends of the target zone segment were isolated through packer air bag and then the target zone was pumped by submersible pump meanwhile the groundwater level of the target zone segment was monitored and recorded in real time by a probe groundwater flows were approximated as radial flow in horizontal direction in data interpretation the interpreted measured 44 k values represent the mean horizontal k on 44 segments and were shown in fig 3 the interpreted k varies over three orders of magnitude showing high heterogeneity as well as a plausible decay trend with depth total dissolved solids tds was measured in laboratory based on water samples collected in stratified pumping tests r w profiles at average temperature 24 c were calculated based on interpolated tds measurements e g fig 5 d below and reciprocal relation of tds r w the relevant data can be found in nan 2019 3 materials and methodology 3 1 akc model a classic k r e relation based on archie and kozeny carman formulae archie formula reflects the relationship between electrical resistivity of granular medium and medium porosity which reads as 2 r e α r w ϕ m s n where r e is volume resistivity of rock matrix r w is resistivity of fluid water in aquifers ϕ is the porosity of the medium n is saturation index m is cementation index which is related to lithology pore structure and diagenesis α is the value related to the aqueous medium s is the saturation of the medium and for the saturated aquifer s 1 in general the values of α and m are obtained by testing core samples in laboratory and then applied to formations of similar lithology kazakis et al 2016 if there is a lack of drilling samples in the study area empirical values can be given according to lithofacies and documented ranges in literature aristodemou and thomas betts 2000 as mentioned above r e and r w data in this study are all corrected to base line temperature 24 c note that in formations of low clay content temperature has similar impacts on r e and r w and hence the ratio r e r w can be considered temperature independent waxman and thomas 1974 though temperature correction is not really required to apply eq 2 in this area these corrections are still carried out in both r e and r w data simply in order to filter out temperature induced trend in data visualization e g r e and tds profiles in fig 5 below in porous media ϕ is closely related to k the pore characteristics such as number size shape direction degree of connectivity and spatial changes determines the soil storage retention release and transmission performance of water niu et al 2015 for two similar sandy media one with a higher ϕ usually has a higher k sikandar and christen 2012 kozeny carman formula can be expressed as carman 1937 kozeny 1927 3 k k c ρ w g d e 2 ϕ 3 180 μ w 1 ϕ 2 where k k c is calculated hydraulic conductivity m s ρ w is water density equal to 1000 kg m3 μ w is dynamic viscosity of water equal to 0 0014 kg m s in this study fetter 1994 temperature dependence of water density and viscosity are very small al shemmeri 2012 and thus ignored due to small temperature variations 11 c in three boreholes g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 d e is the particle size mm set to be average particle size of the corresponding lithological section according to the bore histogram of three boreholes the range of d e used in this study is listed in table 1 the classical akc model is obtained by combining eqs 2 and 3 to eliminate porosity ϕ that is 4 k akc ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w α r e r w 1 m r w α r e 1 m 1 2 k akc represents k value calculated by akc model traditionally akc model is used to convert rock resistivity collected by geophysical method into k this method of estimating k by ϕ has been found effective in granular media with low clay content flint and selker 2003 urumović and sr 2016 3 2 lakc model a new k r e relation based on louis negative exponential model although akc model is useful in estimating k in shallow aquifers kazakis et al 2016 niwas and celik 2012 sikandar and christen 2012 it does not consider k s decay with depth and generally fails in thick aquifers where differences in self weight stress are significant here we employ a negative exponential model which was proposed based on statistical data by louis 1974 and then widely accepted in applications anderman and hill 2003 zhang and franklin 1993 louis negative exponential model is as follows 5 k h k 0 exp a h where k 0 is k at surface k h is k at depth h a is an attenuation coefficient the larger a is the faster k decreases with depth since akc model works properly in near surface sandy aquifers akc based k estimate is taken as k 0 in eq 5 here i e k 0 k akc by combining eqs 4 and 5 one immediately obtains a depth dependent model for k r e relation i e eq 6 or 7 which we refer to as lakc model 6 k h k akc exp a h 7 k h ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w α r e r w 1 m r w α r e 1 m 1 2 exp a h while akc has two parameters α and m lakc has one more parameter a to be determined as mentioned above a reflects how fast k decays with depth researchers tried to find one or several universal attenuation rate s for earth s crust kuang and jiao 2014 and references therein but strictly speaking a actually depends on compressibility of the medium and should have different values for different lithofacies fortunately the variability of rock compressibility is much weaker than k domenico and mifflin 1965 so that one can approximately use a single a value within a stratum without introducing remarkable errors in this study two individual values of a are separately calibrated for huanhe formation k1 h and luohe formation k1 l 3 3 model calibration cross validation and error evaluation to investigate the performance of akc and lakc models we calibrate the models against k and r e data from two boreholes and validate the models using data from the third borehole cross validations are carried out for all three distinct calibration validation combinations of boreholes i e c1 zkh2 zkh5 zkh3 c2 zkh2 zkh3 zkh5 and c3 zkh3 zkh5 zkh2 a parameter estimation software pest doherty 2008 is used for automatic model calibration pest is independent of calculation models and has been widely used in groundwater and soil water transport models see e g fang et al 2010 zyvoloski et al 2003 the ranges and initial guesses of parameters are given according to empirical values in literature cai et al 2017 that is the ranges of parameters α and m are set to 0 48 1 5 and 1 1 3 0 and initial values are 1 0 and 1 2 respectively in both models the initial value and range of a is set to 0 016 m 1 and 0 003 0 03 m 1 note that a has two independent values in huanhe k1 h and luohe formations k1 l the root mean square error rmse is employed to evaluate the model performances rmse can be calculated by the following eq 8 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n k m i k c i 2 where k m is the measured k at the i th test segment and k c is the arithmetic mean of calculated k within the i th test segment according to akc or lakc model and n is the total number of test segments rmse reflects the overall deviation of the model from reference data the smaller rmse is the better the model fits the data the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 and bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 were also used to contrast the effects of lakc model and akc model in parameter estimation the aic and bic can not only measure the deviation between measured data and model predicted data but also reflect the instability caused by the different number of model parameters enemark et al 2019 the smaller value of aic and bic is the better the parameter estimation model performs they are calculated as follows 9 aic n ln ess n 2 p 10 bic n ln ess n p ln n ess is the residual sum of squares between k m and the k c calculated by akc and lakc model n is the total number of test segments and p is the number of model parameters 4 results and discussions 4 1 akc model fig 4 reports calibration results in cross validation experiment in all calibrations both parameters α and m of akc model consistently stop at lower bounds of given ranges i e α 0 48 m 1 1 since estimated α and m are the same for c1 c2 and c3 the calibrated akc models are identical and the resultant rmses are all equal to 1 317 it implies that no optimal fitting is found for akc model within given parameter ranges fig 5 reports fitted k profiles based on akc model and estimated parameters α 0 48 m 1 1 compared to measured k values r e profiles are also included for comparison the fitted k values tend to be much 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than measured k values especially at deep segments the remarkable differences between measured and fitted k values confirm that akc model fails in fitting the data for given parameter ranges without depth attenuation effect note that the given ranges of two parameters include all documented possible values for akc model so far even further extension of parameter ranges does not improve the fitting much not shown the decay of k with depth has to be considered in these boreholes for better fitting 4 2 lakc model fig 6 reports the cross validation results of lakc model it can be seen that the estimation results seem reasonable and close to each other for different schemes of data usage the estimation result suggests that calibrated lakc model is consistent with all the data with different value of α and m for three data usage the rmse for all data in c1 c2 and c3 data usage are 0 073 0 124 and 0 079 respectively fig 7 shows profiles of fitted and measured k values in three boreholes for c1 with parameter estimates α 0 56 m 1 60 a 1 0 0155 m 1 and a 2 0 0070 m 1 the agreement between measured and calculated k profiles confirms the validity of calibrated lakc model similar agreements can be found for the other two groups of estimates thus omitted for brevity to directly compare the goodness of fits for akc and lakc models scatter plots of measured and calculated k values in two models for data usage c1 are shown in fig 8 coefficient of determination r 2 and rmses are also included fig 8 a and 8 b report the results in calibration and validation stages respectively in calibration rmses for akc and lack models are 1 410 and 0 068 respectively and r 2 relative to y x line are 1 038 and 0 944 in validation rmses for akc and lakc are 1 030 and 0 087 respectively and the corresponding r 2 values are 0 902 and 0 999 both high rmse and low r 2 indicate that akc model is not proper to fit the data a negative r 2 in akc model means that the trend of line y x is inconsistent with trend in data in contrast very low rmses and high r 2 show that fitted k values by lakc model are close to measured k values and that lakc model performs far better than akc model in both calibration and validation aic and bic values of akc and lakc models number of parameters p 2 and 4 respectively are calculated using eqs 9 and 10 aic of akc and lakc are 28 2 and 221 8 respectively bic values of them are 31 8 and 214 6 respectively clearly lakc model has smaller values than akc model lakc model performs much better than akc model not because of parameter number the good performance of lakc may result from two major reasons i e 1 the ideal geological environment at the site and 2 the significance of gravity impact the formations mainly consist of sandstones siltstone and gritstone and have very low content of clay thus it provides a good situation in which archie and kozeny carman formulae properly apply in fact akc model works fine in fitting measurements in shallow segments depth 100 m when the entire profile is considered gravity impact on the profile is primary and overwhelming among those factors which akc doesn t take into account as discussed above the attenuation coefficient a in lakc model reflects the variation degree of k and relates to compressibility of media in this study the attenuation coefficient a 1 in huanhe formation is larger than a 2 in luohe formation it implies the decrease of a with increase in depth and compaction degree of strata which is consistent with the finding of jiang et al 2011 parameters α and m are usually determined through core electricity experiments in this study the parameters were obtained in parameter estimation and then verified against the empirical values in similar lithotypes in literature the results show that the estimated values of α and m in the study are close to those in similar lithotypes in literature carothers 1968 in addition although the cretaceous huanhe formation and luohe formation are two different sedimentary strata they are lithologically similar therefore the same set of parameters are used in both huanhe formation and luohe formation in this paper 4 3 k profiles of 5 cm spacing based on r e data based on r e data of 5 cm spacing in well log of three boreholes estimated k profiles of 5 cm spacing from akc model and lakc models are shown in fig 9 for akc model α 0 48 m 1 1 according to parameter estimation above for lakc model α 0 56 m 1 60 a 1 0 0155 m 1 and a 2 0 0070 m 1 it is found that despite of scale difference k profiles from lakc model blue line in three boreholes are all compatible with measured k values at segments red line in trend but reveal much more details of heterogeneity on the other hand k profiles from akc model black line and measured k profiles are quite divergent especially the trend in zkh5 and zkh2 according to fig 9 and lithology records in boreholes strata with relatively high k generally corresponds to coarse sandstone and medium coarse sandstone such as at 385 485 m in zkh5 113 m 320 m in zkh2 and 120 252 m 362 513 m in zkh3 and depth with low k often corresponds to fine sandstone argillaceous siltstone e g at 103 134 m and 484 524 m in zkh5 83 87 m and 468 474 m in zkh2 306 313 m in zkh3 or a thin layer of clay of thickness 0 5 m or less besides the same type of rocks at different depths tend to have different k for example the averaged k of medium sandstone in zkh2 at depth of 90 112 m 333 376 m and 448 468 m are 0 327 0 077 and 0 022 m d respectively it suggests once again that apart from lithology the influence of depth on k must be considered at large depth a comparison of measured and the log k calculated by previous permeability depth models such as the power law model manning and ingebritsen 1999 exponential model saar and magna 2004 and kuang jiao model kuang and jiao 2014 are made here fig 10 the formula k ρ w gk μ w was used to convert permeability k m2 to hydraulic conductivity k m d and the ρ w g μ w take the same value as the parameters in akc and lakc model as shown in fig 10 these existing permeability depth models can reflect the attenuation characteristics of k with depth but the accuracy is far from enough for the study of aquifer heterogeneity furthermore it is difficult to describe the outlier values of k data points in red circles in fig 10 which actually impact groundwater migration significantly it can be seen that general permeability depth models are not good enough in aquifer characterization and that local heterogeneity has to be included the rmse and r 2 for different models are also shown in fig 10 the method of calculating average log k in different models is the same as that used in subsections above the rmse of exponential model is the lowest in three permeability depth models and the rmse of power law model is the highest because of its spurious large values near the surface which is an inherent defect of the model kuang and jiao 2014 the exponential and kuang jiao models seem better at fitting the data except four outliers in red circles zkh3 yielding moderate r 2 values akc model does not consider depth and has a result as bad as those of depth only models or worse negative values of r 2 which appear in fitting of akc model and power law model reflects that the trend of log k calculated by these two models is not consistent with that of measured k lakc model has the lowest rmse and highest r 2 among all the models for all data combinations it shows that lakc model considering both depth and lithology has higher accuracy than those models considering only one single factor 4 4 depth dependency of effective porosity ϕ e and ratio ϕ e ϕ a possible explanation of akc model s failure is the large difference between total porosity ϕ and effective porosity ϕ e in thick aquifers archie formula requires a total porosity ϕ to fully account the contribution of pore water to the electrical resistivity while kozeny carman formula invokes an effective porosity ϕ e for seepage ϕ e and ϕ are close to each other in shallow sandy aquifers and can be eliminated as intermediate variables in akc model but in aquifers of large depth ϕ e and ϕ may be remarkably different and one doesn t have akc model eq 4 if we assume that kozeny carman formula is still valid and denote the effective porosity as ϕ e then k h ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w ϕ e 3 1 ϕ e 2 upon adopting lakc model one gets 11 k h ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w ϕ e 3 1 ϕ e 2 ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 exp a h eq 11 allows one to calculate ϕ e and ϕ fig 11 reports the results of ϕ e and ϕ e ϕ with depth in zkh2 the jumps in both subplots at formation interface depth 475 m are related to our selection of independent a parameter for luohe and huanhe formations fig 11 shows that despite discontinuity at formation interface both ϕ e and ϕ e ϕ have a decreasing trend ϕ e ϕ becomes far below 50 for large depth which is consistent with our analysis of the possible reason of akc failure above 5 conclusions aquifer heterogeneity has significant influences on groundwater flow field solute and heat transport the traditional akc model which relates k to resistivity r e does not consider the impact of depth on k r e relation according to stratified pumping tests at 44 segments in three boreholes k of shallow strata 100 m is much 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in deep strata based on the traditional akc model and the newly established lakc model k within an aquifer of 700 m deep was estimated using r e data from well logs in the attempt of fitting data from stratified pumping tests using akc model it was found that akc model was unable to fit the data to an acceptable extent especially for the decay trend in k though depth probably also impacts rock resistivity standard akc model seems inappropriate in thick aquifers and a depth based modification to akc model is necessary as a depth modified version of akc model lakc model was able to match all the data very well and presented the decay trend in k with increasing depth results from cross validation suggested that lakc model calibrated by data from any two boreholes provides reliable k estimates for the third boreholes according to lithology record and pumping tests in three boreholes k values of similar lithofacies at different depths are quite different showing a decay trend with depth in order to infer k in thick aquifers based on borehole resistivity one should take into account not only lithology induced resistivity variation but also depth led k decay simultaneously this study demonstrated not only the potential of lakc model in k estimation based on resistivity but also the necessity to consider k decay with depth in quantitative description of heterogeneity in thick aquifers it is also possible to reflect depth impact in akc parameters e g cementation index m instead of introducing louis decay function which will be explored in our following study in the future more geophysical methods such as the magnetotelluric transient electromagnetic method etc can be combined to transform resistivity data to k which will be a promising way to obtain the spatial distribution of k with a larger scale and higher dimension declaration of competing interest the authors

6149,predictability of groundwater flow and transport models greatly relies on adequate characterization of aquifer heterogeneity such as hydraulic conductivity k porosity ϕ etc the traditional model combining archie formula and kozeny carman equation thus called akc model in this study has been proven in a large number of studies to be helpful in evaluation of k through electrical resistivity r e however akc model does not take into account the widely reported dependence of k on depth thus often fails in deep formations 100 m as was observed in our study in order to consider the impact of depth on the k r e relation a new model called lakc model was introduced which combined louis decay model with akc model the effectiveness of lakc model was verified against k measurements from stratified pumping tests and applied in a real aquifer in northern ordos basin china the results revealed that lakc model can characterize the depth dependent k r e relation properly and that calibrated lakc model is capable of providing adequate k estimates based on detailed r e measurements in a similar context of lithology keywords aquifer characterization electrical resistivity northern ordos basin depth dependence stratified pumping test 1 introduction regional groundwater flow is critical to understand various geologic processes such as fluid flow in sedimentary basins jiang et al 2009 wang et al 2011 surface ground water interaction winter 1978 heat and solute transport cardenas 2007 niederau et al 2017 etc aquifer heterogeneity is one of the key factors of properly modeling groundwater flow and solute transport unfortunately due to technical and financial limitations it is extremely impractical to reveal the spatial variability of real aquifers using traditional approaches like pumping tests and drilling binley et al 2015 nan and wu 2017 yeh and liu 2000 it is still challenging for hydrogeologists to collect sufficient and reliable information to infer aquifer heterogeneity such as detailed distributions of hydraulic parameters e g hydraulic conductivity k and porosity ϕ the predictability and reliability of groundwater models especially those of solute migration can thus be significantly undermined in highly heterogeneous media mizukami et al 2017 nan et al 2019 yoon et al 2013 zheng et al 2011 in recent decades the emergence of and advances in hydrogeophysics have made it possible to collect information of aquifer heterogeneity with growing amounts and accuracy and even to estimate hydraulic parameters quantitatively dhakate and singh 2005 frohlich 1994 niwas and de lima 2003 rezaei et al 2016 zakari et al 2015 the geophysical approaches provide fast and effective technical supports for aquifer exploration and evaluation and have become alternatives to traditional hydrogeological approaches to obtain hydrogeological parameters binley et al 2015 singh 2005 the similarity between ohm s law and darcy s law as well as linkage between geoelectric and hydraulic properties of formations made it possible to estimate hydrogeological parameters through geoelectric methods louis et al 2004 there have been many studies on the relationship between electrical resistivity r e and hydrogeological parameters in sandy media among which the archie formula had been accepted by many researchers archie 1942 dick et al 2018 robinson et al 2012 singha and gorelick 2006 whitman and yeboah forson 2015 yeh et al 2002 zha et al 2017 in a large number of studies r e obtained by geophysical methods were converted into hydraulic conductivity k through a model combining archie equation and kozeny carman equation termed akc model for brevity and the performance of akc model was acceptable in shallow formations kazakis et al 2016 niwas and celik 2012 sikandar and christen 2012 though in near surface environments 1km heterogeneity e g lithofacies is a controlling factor of permeability or equivalently k gleeson et al 2011 ranjram et al 2014 permeability and k were also found dependent on locale depth in fact a number of studies demonstrated that permeability generally decays with depth jiang et al 2009 louis 1974 manning and ingebritsen 1999 ranjram et al 2014 snow 1968 wang et al 2009 such decay behaviors can be remarkable in thick aquifers and significantly change the conditions of regional groundwater flow systems jiang et al 2010 saar and magna 2004 zhao 1998 but quantitative descriptions of depth related decay is still limited sanford 2017 there were studies on depth s impact on permeability through empirical or semi empirical methods see jiang et al 2011 kuang and jiao 2014 and references therein to describe the general relationship between permeability and depth a few models were proposed among which two major types were widely used i e the power law model bredehoeft et al 1992 ingebritsen and manning 2002 2010 manning and ingebritsen 1999 stober and bucher 2007 and the exponential model jiang et al 2010 louis 1974 saar and magna 2004 williams and narasimhan 1989 these models were aimed to a general rule of depth permeability relation so that intrinsic heterogeneity of medium such as lithofacies was ignored and variations in observed permeability data in a large range of depth were fully attributed to depth kuang and jiao 2014 in thick and highly heterogeneous aquifers it is better to take into account the impacts of both formation heterogeneity and depth in this paper we develop a depth dependent k r e model which combines a depth permeability model of louis 1974 exponential type and widely used akc model hence the proposed model is called lakc model rather than analyzing the impact of gravity stress depth on each akc parameter or intermediate separately a lumped exponential function is used to fully account for gravity impact to the final k estimates our goal is to consider the impacts of aquifer heterogeneity and depth simultaneously so that k in thick regional aquifers can be estimated by r e measurements collected by geophysical methods in a parsimonious manner to analyze the applicability of lakc model we investigate the performance of lakc model in a cross validation experiment based on k and r e measurements collected in three boreholes of depth 700 m in a thick aquifer that is lakc model is calibrated via pest code using measurements from any two boreholes and validated using measurements from the third borehole to demonstrate the necessity of including depth dependence akc model is also applied in a similar procedure and compared to lakc model after validation of lakc model we apply it in estimating detailed k values from 5 cm spacing r e data throughout the boreholes this paper is structured as follows section 2 explains akc model lakc model and calibration procedures section 3 presents the information of the study area and available data in section 4 we analyze the predictability of lakc model in a cross validation experiment compared to akc model and apply lakc model throughout depth to obtain detailed k distributions and discuss depth dependency of effective porosity section 5 provides a summary and the main conclusions 2 study area and available data the hydrogeological exploration boreholes zkh5 zkh2 and zkh3 in this study are located in the middle and low desert plain of wushenqi area the lake concentrated area in northern ordos basin china fig 1 the strata in this area are almost horizontal and all the strata are terrigenous clastic deposits the hydrogeological profile of the study area is shown in fig 2 the aquifer under study mainly consists of lower cretaceous luohe formation k1 l and lower cretaceous huanhe formation k1 h the lithofacies are semi cemented siltstone fine medium coarse sandstone gritstone and sandwiched silty mudstone with well developed pores and low shale content at the top is discontinuously distributed quaternary holocene aeolian sand layer q4 eol thickness 10 m the underlying formation below k1 l is jurassic anding formation j2 a depth 800 m in most areas consisting of low permeability dense fine sandstone and pelite since no continuous aquifuge layer exists above j2 a the formations within 800 m deep can be treated as a unified aquifer of large thickness over 800 m yin et al 2011 the total depths of boreholes zkh2 zkh3 and zkh5 are 958 m 703 m and 753 m respectively three boreholes expose quaternary holocene aeolian sand layer q4 eol at depth 0 m 0 10 m and 0 1 6 m respectively huanhe formation k1 h is found in the three boreholes at 0 474 m 10 330 m and 1 6 574 m respectively luohe formation k1 l are 474 880 m 330 701 m and 574 753 m respectively anding formation j2 a is exposed by zkh2 and zkh3 at 880 m and 701 m see fig 2 in this study xskc 92 logging instrument was used for well logging by using this instrument the borehole temperature and measured resistivity r 0 values of depth 5 700 m were collected from zkh5 zkh2 and zkh3 boreholes with electrode space equal to 5 cm the range of temperature in three boreholes at all depths are 19 30 c and the average is about 24 c considering the influence of ground temperature variation on r 0 within 700 m depth the temperature correction for r 0 is carried out by arps formula arps 1953 1 r e t 0 21 5 t e 21 5 r 0 where t 0 c is the borehole temperature r 0 ω m is the measured resistivity and r e ω m is the electrical resistivity at a base line temperature t e equal to average temperature in three boreholes stratified pumping tests based on solexperts heavy duty double packer system hddp were conducted in 44 borehole segments of length 20 m or 50 m hddp is a set of drilling water sample acquisition system consisting of two balloon embolisms packers in this method two packers were inflated with high pressure nitrogen and in close contact with the well wall to produce water stopping effect the non target sections at both ends of the target zone segment were isolated through packer air bag and then the target zone was pumped by submersible pump meanwhile the groundwater level of the target zone segment was monitored and recorded in real time by a probe groundwater flows were approximated as radial flow in horizontal direction in data interpretation the interpreted measured 44 k values represent the mean horizontal k on 44 segments and were shown in fig 3 the interpreted k varies over three orders of magnitude showing high heterogeneity as well as a plausible decay trend with depth total dissolved solids tds was measured in laboratory based on water samples collected in stratified pumping tests r w profiles at average temperature 24 c were calculated based on interpolated tds measurements e g fig 5 d below and reciprocal relation of tds r w the relevant data can be found in nan 2019 3 materials and methodology 3 1 akc model a classic k r e relation based on archie and kozeny carman formulae archie formula reflects the relationship between electrical resistivity of granular medium and medium porosity which reads as 2 r e α r w ϕ m s n where r e is volume resistivity of rock matrix r w is resistivity of fluid water in aquifers ϕ is the porosity of the medium n is saturation index m is cementation index which is related to lithology pore structure and diagenesis α is the value related to the aqueous medium s is the saturation of the medium and for the saturated aquifer s 1 in general the values of α and m are obtained by testing core samples in laboratory and then applied to formations of similar lithology kazakis et al 2016 if there is a lack of drilling samples in the study area empirical values can be given according to lithofacies and documented ranges in literature aristodemou and thomas betts 2000 as mentioned above r e and r w data in this study are all corrected to base line temperature 24 c note that in formations of low clay content temperature has similar impacts on r e and r w and hence the ratio r e r w can be considered temperature independent waxman and thomas 1974 though temperature correction is not really required to apply eq 2 in this area these corrections are still carried out in both r e and r w data simply in order to filter out temperature induced trend in data visualization e g r e and tds profiles in fig 5 below in porous media ϕ is closely related to k the pore characteristics such as number size shape direction degree of connectivity and spatial changes determines the soil storage retention release and transmission performance of water niu et al 2015 for two similar sandy media one with a higher ϕ usually has a higher k sikandar and christen 2012 kozeny carman formula can be expressed as carman 1937 kozeny 1927 3 k k c ρ w g d e 2 ϕ 3 180 μ w 1 ϕ 2 where k k c is calculated hydraulic conductivity m s ρ w is water density equal to 1000 kg m3 μ w is dynamic viscosity of water equal to 0 0014 kg m s in this study fetter 1994 temperature dependence of water density and viscosity are very small al shemmeri 2012 and thus ignored due to small temperature variations 11 c in three boreholes g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 d e is the particle size mm set to be average particle size of the corresponding lithological section according to the bore histogram of three boreholes the range of d e used in this study is listed in table 1 the classical akc model is obtained by combining eqs 2 and 3 to eliminate porosity ϕ that is 4 k akc ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w α r e r w 1 m r w α r e 1 m 1 2 k akc represents k value calculated by akc model traditionally akc model is used to convert rock resistivity collected by geophysical method into k this method of estimating k by ϕ has been found effective in granular media with low clay content flint and selker 2003 urumović and sr 2016 3 2 lakc model a new k r e relation based on louis negative exponential model although akc model is useful in estimating k in shallow aquifers kazakis et al 2016 niwas and celik 2012 sikandar and christen 2012 it does not consider k s decay with depth and generally fails in thick aquifers where differences in self weight stress are significant here we employ a negative exponential model which was proposed based on statistical data by louis 1974 and then widely accepted in applications anderman and hill 2003 zhang and franklin 1993 louis negative exponential model is as follows 5 k h k 0 exp a h where k 0 is k at surface k h is k at depth h a is an attenuation coefficient the larger a is the faster k decreases with depth since akc model works properly in near surface sandy aquifers akc based k estimate is taken as k 0 in eq 5 here i e k 0 k akc by combining eqs 4 and 5 one immediately obtains a depth dependent model for k r e relation i e eq 6 or 7 which we refer to as lakc model 6 k h k akc exp a h 7 k h ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w α r e r w 1 m r w α r e 1 m 1 2 exp a h while akc has two parameters α and m lakc has one more parameter a to be determined as mentioned above a reflects how fast k decays with depth researchers tried to find one or several universal attenuation rate s for earth s crust kuang and jiao 2014 and references therein but strictly speaking a actually depends on compressibility of the medium and should have different values for different lithofacies fortunately the variability of rock compressibility is much weaker than k domenico and mifflin 1965 so that one can approximately use a single a value within a stratum without introducing remarkable errors in this study two individual values of a are separately calibrated for huanhe formation k1 h and luohe formation k1 l 3 3 model calibration cross validation and error evaluation to investigate the performance of akc and lakc models we calibrate the models against k and r e data from two boreholes and validate the models using data from the third borehole cross validations are carried out for all three distinct calibration validation combinations of boreholes i e c1 zkh2 zkh5 zkh3 c2 zkh2 zkh3 zkh5 and c3 zkh3 zkh5 zkh2 a parameter estimation software pest doherty 2008 is used for automatic model calibration pest is independent of calculation models and has been widely used in groundwater and soil water transport models see e g fang et al 2010 zyvoloski et al 2003 the ranges and initial guesses of parameters are given according to empirical values in literature cai et al 2017 that is the ranges of parameters α and m are set to 0 48 1 5 and 1 1 3 0 and initial values are 1 0 and 1 2 respectively in both models the initial value and range of a is set to 0 016 m 1 and 0 003 0 03 m 1 note that a has two independent values in huanhe k1 h and luohe formations k1 l the root mean square error rmse is employed to evaluate the model performances rmse can be calculated by the following eq 8 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n k m i k c i 2 where k m is the measured k at the i th test segment and k c is the arithmetic mean of calculated k within the i th test segment according to akc or lakc model and n is the total number of test segments rmse reflects the overall deviation of the model from reference data the smaller rmse is the better the model fits the data the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 and bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 were also used to contrast the effects of lakc model and akc model in parameter estimation the aic and bic can not only measure the deviation between measured data and model predicted data but also reflect the instability caused by the different number of model parameters enemark et al 2019 the smaller value of aic and bic is the better the parameter estimation model performs they are calculated as follows 9 aic n ln ess n 2 p 10 bic n ln ess n p ln n ess is the residual sum of squares between k m and the k c calculated by akc and lakc model n is the total number of test segments and p is the number of model parameters 4 results and discussions 4 1 akc model fig 4 reports calibration results in cross validation experiment in all calibrations both parameters α and m of akc model consistently stop at lower bounds of given ranges i e α 0 48 m 1 1 since estimated α and m are the same for c1 c2 and c3 the calibrated akc models are identical and the resultant rmses are all equal to 1 317 it implies that no optimal fitting is found for akc model within given parameter ranges fig 5 reports fitted k profiles based on akc model and estimated parameters α 0 48 m 1 1 compared to measured k values r e profiles are also included for comparison the fitted k values tend to be much 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than measured k values especially at deep segments the remarkable differences between measured and fitted k values confirm that akc model fails in fitting the data for given parameter ranges without depth attenuation effect note that the given ranges of two parameters include all documented possible values for akc model so far even further extension of parameter ranges does not improve the fitting much not shown the decay of k with depth has to be considered in these boreholes for better fitting 4 2 lakc model fig 6 reports the cross validation results of lakc model it can be seen that the estimation results seem reasonable and close to each other for different schemes of data usage the estimation result suggests that calibrated lakc model is consistent with all the data with different value of α and m for three data usage the rmse for all data in c1 c2 and c3 data usage are 0 073 0 124 and 0 079 respectively fig 7 shows profiles of fitted and measured k values in three boreholes for c1 with parameter estimates α 0 56 m 1 60 a 1 0 0155 m 1 and a 2 0 0070 m 1 the agreement between measured and calculated k profiles confirms the validity of calibrated lakc model similar agreements can be found for the other two groups of estimates thus omitted for brevity to directly compare the goodness of fits for akc and lakc models scatter plots of measured and calculated k values in two models for data usage c1 are shown in fig 8 coefficient of determination r 2 and rmses are also included fig 8 a and 8 b report the results in calibration and validation stages respectively in calibration rmses for akc and lack models are 1 410 and 0 068 respectively and r 2 relative to y x line are 1 038 and 0 944 in validation rmses for akc and lakc are 1 030 and 0 087 respectively and the corresponding r 2 values are 0 902 and 0 999 both high rmse and low r 2 indicate that akc model is not proper to fit the data a negative r 2 in akc model means that the trend of line y x is inconsistent with trend in data in contrast very low rmses and high r 2 show that fitted k values by lakc model are close to measured k values and that lakc model performs far better than akc model in both calibration and validation aic and bic values of akc and lakc models number of parameters p 2 and 4 respectively are calculated using eqs 9 and 10 aic of akc and lakc are 28 2 and 221 8 respectively bic values of them are 31 8 and 214 6 respectively clearly lakc model has smaller values than akc model lakc model performs much better than akc model not because of parameter number the good performance of lakc may result from two major reasons i e 1 the ideal geological environment at the site and 2 the significance of gravity impact the formations mainly consist of sandstones siltstone and gritstone and have very low content of clay thus it provides a good situation in which archie and kozeny carman formulae properly apply in fact akc model works fine in fitting measurements in shallow segments depth 100 m when the entire profile is considered gravity impact on the profile is primary and overwhelming among those factors which akc doesn t take into account as discussed above the attenuation coefficient a in lakc model reflects the variation degree of k and relates to compressibility of media in this study the attenuation coefficient a 1 in huanhe formation is larger than a 2 in luohe formation it implies the decrease of a with increase in depth and compaction degree of strata which is consistent with the finding of jiang et al 2011 parameters α and m are usually determined through core electricity experiments in this study the parameters were obtained in parameter estimation and then verified against the empirical values in similar lithotypes in literature the results show that the estimated values of α and m in the study are close to those in similar lithotypes in literature carothers 1968 in addition although the cretaceous huanhe formation and luohe formation are two different sedimentary strata they are lithologically similar therefore the same set of parameters are used in both huanhe formation and luohe formation in this paper 4 3 k profiles of 5 cm spacing based on r e data based on r e data of 5 cm spacing in well log of three boreholes estimated k profiles of 5 cm spacing from akc model and lakc models are shown in fig 9 for akc model α 0 48 m 1 1 according to parameter estimation above for lakc model α 0 56 m 1 60 a 1 0 0155 m 1 and a 2 0 0070 m 1 it is found that despite of scale difference k profiles from lakc model blue line in three boreholes are all compatible with measured k values at segments red line in trend but reveal much more details of heterogeneity on the other hand k profiles from akc model black line and measured k profiles are quite divergent especially the trend in zkh5 and zkh2 according to fig 9 and lithology records in boreholes strata with relatively high k generally corresponds to coarse sandstone and medium coarse sandstone such as at 385 485 m in zkh5 113 m 320 m in zkh2 and 120 252 m 362 513 m in zkh3 and depth with low k often corresponds to fine sandstone argillaceous siltstone e g at 103 134 m and 484 524 m in zkh5 83 87 m and 468 474 m in zkh2 306 313 m in zkh3 or a thin layer of clay of thickness 0 5 m or less besides the same type of rocks at different depths tend to have different k for example the averaged k of medium sandstone in zkh2 at depth of 90 112 m 333 376 m and 448 468 m are 0 327 0 077 and 0 022 m d respectively it suggests once again that apart from lithology the influence of depth on k must be considered at large depth a comparison of measured and the log k calculated by previous permeability depth models such as the power law model manning and ingebritsen 1999 exponential model saar and magna 2004 and kuang jiao model kuang and jiao 2014 are made here fig 10 the formula k ρ w gk μ w was used to convert permeability k m2 to hydraulic conductivity k m d and the ρ w g μ w take the same value as the parameters in akc and lakc model as shown in fig 10 these existing permeability depth models can reflect the attenuation characteristics of k with depth but the accuracy is far from enough for the study of aquifer heterogeneity furthermore it is difficult to describe the outlier values of k data points in red circles in fig 10 which actually impact groundwater migration significantly it can be seen that general permeability depth models are not good enough in aquifer characterization and that local heterogeneity has to be included the rmse and r 2 for different models are also shown in fig 10 the method of calculating average log k in different models is the same as that used in subsections above the rmse of exponential model is the lowest in three permeability depth models and the rmse of power law model is the highest because of its spurious large values near the surface which is an inherent defect of the model kuang and jiao 2014 the exponential and kuang jiao models seem better at fitting the data except four outliers in red circles zkh3 yielding moderate r 2 values akc model does not consider depth and has a result as bad as those of depth only models or worse negative values of r 2 which appear in fitting of akc model and power law model reflects that the trend of log k calculated by these two models is not consistent with that of measured k lakc model has the lowest rmse and highest r 2 among all the models for all data combinations it shows that lakc model considering both depth and lithology has higher accuracy than those models considering only one single factor 4 4 depth dependency of effective porosity ϕ e and ratio ϕ e ϕ a possible explanation of akc model s failure is the large difference between total porosity ϕ and effective porosity ϕ e in thick aquifers archie formula requires a total porosity ϕ to fully account the contribution of pore water to the electrical resistivity while kozeny carman formula invokes an effective porosity ϕ e for seepage ϕ e and ϕ are close to each other in shallow sandy aquifers and can be eliminated as intermediate variables in akc model but in aquifers of large depth ϕ e and ϕ may be remarkably different and one doesn t have akc model eq 4 if we assume that kozeny carman formula is still valid and denote the effective porosity as ϕ e then k h ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w ϕ e 3 1 ϕ e 2 upon adopting lakc model one gets 11 k h ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w ϕ e 3 1 ϕ e 2 ρ w g d e 2 180 μ w ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 exp a h eq 11 allows one to calculate ϕ e and ϕ fig 11 reports the results of ϕ e and ϕ e ϕ with depth in zkh2 the jumps in both subplots at formation interface depth 475 m are related to our selection of independent a parameter for luohe and huanhe formations fig 11 shows that despite discontinuity at formation interface both ϕ e and ϕ e ϕ have a decreasing trend ϕ e ϕ becomes far below 50 for large depth which is consistent with our analysis of the possible reason of akc failure above 5 conclusions aquifer heterogeneity has significant influences on groundwater flow field solute and heat transport the traditional akc model which relates k to resistivity r e does not consider the impact of depth on k r e relation according to stratified pumping tests at 44 segments in three boreholes k of shallow strata 100 m is much 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in deep strata based on the traditional akc model and the newly established lakc model k within an aquifer of 700 m deep was estimated using r e data from well logs in the attempt of fitting data from stratified pumping tests using akc model it was found that akc model was unable to fit the data to an acceptable extent especially for the decay trend in k though depth probably also impacts rock resistivity standard akc model seems inappropriate in thick aquifers and a depth based modification to akc model is necessary as a depth modified version of akc model lakc model was able to match all the data very well and presented the decay trend in k with increasing depth results from cross validation suggested that lakc model calibrated by data from any two boreholes provides reliable k estimates for the third boreholes according to lithology record and pumping tests in three boreholes k values of similar lithofacies at different depths are quite different showing a decay trend with depth in order to infer k in thick aquifers based on borehole resistivity one should take into account not only lithology induced resistivity variation but also depth led k decay simultaneously this study demonstrated not only the potential of lakc model in k estimation based on resistivity but also the necessity to consider k decay with depth in quantitative description of heterogeneity in thick aquifers it is also possible to reflect depth impact in akc parameters e g cementation index m instead of introducing louis decay function which will be explored in our following study in the future more geophysical methods such as the magnetotelluric transient electromagnetic method etc can be combined to transform resistivity data to k which will be a promising way to obtain the spatial distribution of k with a larger scale and higher dimension declaration of competing interest the authors
