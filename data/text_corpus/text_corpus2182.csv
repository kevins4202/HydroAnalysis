10910,mopeco uses the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology to determine the irrigation schedule that maximizes the gross margin gm of annual crops when the availability of irrigation water is limited to this end it is necessary to determine the functions that relate gm to the gross irrigation water ig supplied to the crop given that mopeco is designed for implementation by farmers using online tools the time required to obtain the gm vs ig function must be low thus the objective was to develop and validate a methodology to generate the most accurate gm vs ig function with a low calculation time that takes into consideration the effect of irrigation uniformity on final yield five sub models were developed and evaluated with barley onion and maize for the semi arid conditions of castilla la mancha spain the sub models included one or more of the following variables yield y effective precipitation pef soil moisture s and its distribution uniformity at plot level cu the sub model y pef s cu achieved the best fitting the other sub models y y pef y pef s and y pef cu provided solutions that were very close to the optimum with low calculation time nevertheless the best fit of each sub model to the optimum function was achieved in different sections of this function therefore the five sub models are complementary and it is advisable to use them simultaneously thanks to their low calculation time requirements 3 9 s the validation with the three crops showed that in farms where irrigation uniformity and water price are low and harvest price is high it is economically advisable to apply higher irrigation depths than the crop irrigation requirements nevertheless as improving agricultural water productivity is key for sustaining the environment tools like mopeco may help to maximize gm and increase water use efficiency by means of deficit irrigation strategies keywords mopeco ordi water productivity irrigation uniformity 1 introduction in order to improve irrigation management on farms numerous growth simulation models have been developed and calibrated such as cropsyst stockle et al 1994 pilote mailhol et al 1997 wofost boogaard et al 1998 daisy abrahamsen and hansen 2000 apsim keating et al 2003 mopeco ortega et al 2004 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 among others all these models are able to simulate the crop yield from a particular irrigation schedule given the climatic conditions with varying degrees of precision however mopeco is the only model that uses the methodology of optimized regulated deficit irrigation by stages ordi domínguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015 to determine the irrigation scheduling that maximizes the gross margin gm of the crop with a limited amount of available irrigation water this considerably increases its usefulness as an irrigation management tool in farms with water scarce conditions domínguez et al 2017 in this sense some authors have used the previous models to determine the irrigation schedule that optimizes crop yield and even the profitability of farms developing their own algorithms or using other pre existing ones akhtar et al 2013 geerts et al 2010 kloss et al 2012 linker et al 2016 moreover ordi methodology can be improved when determining the optimal irrigation schedule if we take into account the levels of deficit reached in each stage of crop development as a result of irrigation water uniformity the amount of water available in the root zone or the amount of rain forecast as with any optimization problem the time taken to obtain the results and their accuracy depend on the process used in the case of optimization of irrigation scheduling most authors resort to metaheuristic techniques de paly and zell 2009 garg and dadhich 2014 lalehzari et al 2015 perea et al 2016 tong and guo 2013 tsang and jim 2016 metaheuristic methods aim to reach a solution that is close or even equal to the optimal solution by means of progressive improvement in the results obtained by the optimizer which involves extremely high computational requirements the use of this methodology is justified by the difficulty of developing a direct solution algorithm that calculates a single result equal to the optimal solution which must be compatible with the use of crop simulation models that require a large amount of data and variables for their operation ioslovich et al 2012 the importance of the rapid mathematical resolution of optimal irrigation scheduling calculation lies in being able to offer this tool to a large number of online users in this case the computational requirements are proportional to the number of users to be served at a given time furthermore the greater the number of variables considered the more complex the optimization problem to be solved may be and the more accurate might be the results in this sense the main variables considered by the mopeco model that can be used in the optimization process are crop yield y effective precipitation pef quantity of water available in the root zone s and uniformity of water distribution in the soil after its application in the plot by the irrigation system cu lópez mata et al 2010 the aim of this work was to develop a methodology based on ordi for optimal irrigation scheduling calculation that quickly and efficiently maximizes the gm vs ig function of each crop while being compatible with the mopeco model to achieve this three specific objectives were proposed i to develop five sub models for a rapid determination of optimal irrigation scheduling based on a yield y b yield and effective precipitation y pef c yield effective precipitation and the amount of available water in the soil y pef s d yield effective precipitation and the water uniformity in the soil y pef cu and e yield effective precipitation and the amount and uniformity of water in the soil y pef s cu ii to develop a methodology that takes into account the effect on crop yield of irrigation water uniformity in the soil iii to validate the different sub models and determine which one obtains the gm vs ig functions that best fit the pareto frontier generated through 300 000 random simulations of three crops barley maize and onion and three different climatic conditions dry intermediate and wet year 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation of crop yield to estimate the crop yield mopeco uses the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 1 y y m a x i 1 n 1 k y i 1 e t a i e t m i where y is the crop yield kg ha 1 ymax is the maximum crop yield without water stress and other constraints kg ha 1 ky is the crop sensitivity coefficient to water stress for each stage doorenbos and kassam 1979 and eta and etm are the actual and maximum accumulated crop evapotranspiration respectively for each of the n stages considered mm the duration of development stages is based on the accumulated growing degree day gdd method which is calculated using double triangulation methodology sevacherian et al 1977 this methodology requires the daily maximum and minimum temperature the threshold temperatures between which the normal development of the crop takes place and the duration in gdd of each phenological stage considered for the daily calculation of etm the model uses the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 which requires the daily values of the crop coefficient kc doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and the daily reference evapotranspiration eto to calculate eta it is necessary to perform a daily water balance in the soil in which the inputs are pef nrcs 2004 and the net irrigation while the outputs are the eta and the deep percolation losses in this sense the model considers three soil horizons the first is occupied by the roots the second is that being colonized by the roots when they grow during the vegetative development stage and the third is that which will never be reached by the roots and therefore the water that reaches that level is considered as water lost through deep percolation domínguez et al 2011 in the daily soil water balance the eta value depends on the atmospheric evaporative demand and the soil water content if this is higher than the allowable depletion level adl defined as the fraction of total available water taw that a crop can use without going into water stress then eta etm otherwise the crop will start to suffer water stress and eta etm which is calculated according to the equation proposed by allen et al 1998 2 e t a n e t m n i f c 1 n a d l n e t m n c 1 n p w p r d n a d l n p w p r d n i f a d l n c 1 n p w p r d n where c1n is the water content in the soil occupied by the crop roots at time n with it being necessary to perform a daily balance of the soil water content adl is the permissible depletion level of the crop in relative terms to field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp adln is the permissible depletion level in absolute terms considering the crop root depth at time n and rdn is the crop root depth at time n 2 2 simulation of the irrigation water uniformity effect on crop yield to simulate the effect on crop yield of irrigation uniformity and its subsequent redistribution in the root area mopeco divides the irrigated plot into n subplots 25 are sufficient in the cases analyzed and performs a daily water balance for each of them obtaining the yield at the end of the crop development cycle for each subplot by integrating the yields obtained in the set of soil fractions using a combination of simpson s 1 3 rule and 3 8 rule the total yield of the irrigated plot is obtained to calculate the irrigation water distribution in the different fractions of the plot the model uses christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 together with the irrigation water distribution in the plot fitted to a normal cumulative function heermann et al 1992 warrick et al 1989 consequently the amount of water received by each of the n considered fractions can be calculated from the variation coefficient cv and the average irrigation depth applied r fig 1 the value of cu will be that estimated or measured for the set of irrigation events performed in the plot depending on the irrigation system used and the management and maintenance level implemented lópez mata et al 2010 3 c u 1 i 1 w v i v w v 100 4 c v 1 c u 100 2 π where cu is christiansen s uniformity coefficient vi is the water volume collected at the w control points mm v is the average of all the volumes mm and cv is the coefficient of variation of the volume of irrigation water that reaches the ground for a normal distribution the percentage of the area adequately irrigated pa describes the proportion of the plot that receives at least the amount of predetermined irrigation water r the rest of the plot will receive an irrigation depth of less than r thus 5 p a 1 φ m 1 c v 6 m r r where φ is the probability distribution function of normal distribution which has no analytical expression so it is necessary to resort to a numerical approximation such as that of abramowitz and stegun 1966 with a maximum error of 7 5 10 8 cv is the variation coefficient eq 4 m is the multiplier that allows the average irrigation depth applied to the whole plot r to be transformed into the irrigation depth received by each of the subplots into which the plot has been divided both eq 1 and the ordi methodology establish that the maximum eta etm ratio that can be reached in a particular stage of crop development is 1 which is equivalent to the maximum crop requirements therefore higher irrigation depths should not be applied since the result would be a loss in irrigation water productivity due to leaching in any event this is not a problem for the model when calculating yield vs net irrigation y vs in without taking into account the irrigation supply uniformity or when this is close to 100 however with lower cu values the impossibility of obtaining the complete curve arises since mopeco performs irrigation programming at the midpoint of the plot that is at the plot point corresponding to a value of pa 50 this means that 50 of the plot receives a quantity of water lower than the etm decreasing the yield in the total plot it is then impossible to implement an irrigation schedule that applies an irrigation depth greater than the etm for 50 of the irrigated area in order to show this limitation the yield vs net irrigation function for sub model y is shown as an example fig 2 a when this methodology is applied for cu 75 to solve this limitation a methodology was developed that allows the pa value to be changed in order to reach values 50 the methodology is based on the irrigation scheduling calculated during the same crop stage using different pa values with the same calculation method being similar if the average irrigation applied r is the same 7 r i r i 1 m i 1 r i 2 m i 2 r i 1 1 φ 1 1 p a 1 c v i r i 2 1 φ 1 1 p a 2 c v i where r i is the average irrigation applied to the plot ri1 is the amount of irrigation water received by pa1 area which will be equal to r i by its multiplier mi1 ri2 is obtained for pa2 area in the same way and cvi is the variation coefficient of the irrigation depth applied in the stage in question with this value depending on the uniformity coefficient eq 5 to obtain an irrigation schedule for any desired water amount rtotal higher than the irrigation level obtained to satisfy the crop requirements eta etm 1 for pa 50 irrigation depth denominated rmax 50 the model calculates the pa value that achieves eta etm 1 by applying the amount of water rtotal 8 m r m a x 50 r t o t a l using multiplier m from eq 8 in eq 5 we obtain the pa value for an average irrigation depth equal to the total irrigation desired rtotal with eta etm 1 in all the crop stages hence the complete response curve of the crop for each sub model is obtained fig 2b 2 3 optimal distribution of irrigation water available at the farm to maximize yield the last step of the mopeco model is to determine the crop distribution on the farm that maximizes the gm by calculating the irrigable area and irrigation volume to be applied to each crop to do this it is previously necessary to determine the y vs in function that achieves the maximum yield for each net irrigation volume applied to each crop fig 2b as well as the irrigation schedule that achieves the maximum yield 9 r t o t a l r 1 r 2 r m 1 r m in the equation used by mopeco to estimate the crop yield eq 1 this depends on the eta etm ratio reached in each development stage ky which is significantly conditioned by irrigation water distribution during the season therefore the function to be optimized is a yield function that accepts each of the irrigations applied to the crop as parameters and which also determines the amount of irrigation water to be provided in each stage of crop development to achieve combinations of eta etm that obtain the maximum yield this concept is the basis of the ordi methodology domínguez et al 2012a 10 y r 1 r 2 r m 1 r m f 1 r 1 r a f 2 r 1 r b f n r 1 r m where n is the number of crop stages considered and m the number of irrigations events applied the irrigation and rainfall distribution means that the daily eta etm value is not constant over time since it depends on the soil water content and the climatic conditions on each day however in order to simplify the optimization process in this work it was assumed to be possible to implement an irrigation distribution in such a way that the daily eta etm ratio remains constant throughout each development stage average value for the stage and is equal to the target eta etm ratio corresponding to the entire stage with this assumption the irrigations established to achieve the target eta etm relationship in each stage can be grouped into a single irrigation it was also assumed that the stages are independent of each other in order to avoid the effect on eta etm of the amount of soil available water at the beginning of the next development stage in this way in the yield function to be maximized the factor value of each stage only depends on the total amount of irrigation water applied to each one eq 11 11 y r 1 r 2 r n 1 r n f 1 r 1 f 2 r 2 f n 1 r n 1 f n r n 12 r t o t a l r 1 r 2 r n where n is the number of growing stages considered for the mopeco model each of the factors corresponding to the ky stages in eq 11 can be expressed as according to eq 1 13 f i r i 1 k y i 1 e t a i r i e t m i during the optimization process the only unknown variable in eq 13 is irrigation r since a previously calibrated value of ky is chosen for the crop and a priori known climatic data are used this allows the duration of each development stage and the corresponding value of etm to be determined eta r is the function that calculates the actual crop evapotranspiration in each development stage according to the irrigation applied being considered in this work as an optimization sub model in annex a it is mathematically demonstrated that the maximum crop yield for a limited irrigation water volume rtotal is obtained when the value of f i r i r i f i r i is the same for each of the development stages this value is called multiplier divided by the derivative of the multiplier mdm 14 m d m i r i f i r i r i f i r i 1 k y i 1 e t a i r i e t m i k y i e t m i r i e t a i r i if the functions mdmi ri of each stage are injective an optimization algorithm based on the search for the mdm value can be created where the sum of the irrigation events obtained for each of the stages ri is equal to the total desired irrigation rtotal thus the optimization problem instead of searching for n optimal values which are the irrigations for each stage involves finding only an mdm value regardless of the number of stages in this way the computational complexity is greatly reduced therefore the optimization algorithm is based on solving eq 15 15 f r t o t a l m d m i 1 n m d m i 1 m d m where the m d m i 1 m d m functions are the inverse functions of the m d m i r i function for each of the n crop stages when the irrigation uniformity effect is considered the mdm algorithm generates a distribution of the total desired irrigation rtotal for each stage however when assigning the irrigation that obtains a ratio of eta etm 1 which would be the maximum irrigation for pa 50 the optimizer cannot assign more irrigation than that established by the upper limits of each of the stages for this reason the methodology described in section 2 2 for changing the pa value was used eq 5 and 8 2 4 optimization sub models to determine the daily value of eta eq 2 in each subplot when the irrigation uniformity effect is considered fig 1 it is necessary to perform a daily water balance in each subplot for this the inputs are the water content in the root zone the irrigation water applied in each subplot eqs 3 6 and effective precipitation the balance outputs are the eta and the deep percolation losses domínguez et al 2011 the greater the number of these factors taken into account when determining the etai ri value in eq 13 the more complex are the calculation requirements of the algorithm to be developed thus five sub models were developed with an increasing level of complexity in order to determine whether greater calculation requirements achieve greater precision sub model y in which to calculate the soil water balance and determine the eta only the irrigation water applied to the crop is considered sub model y pef which takes into account the irrigation applied to the crop and the effective precipitation sub model y pef s which takes into account the irrigation applied to the crop the effective precipitation and the initial water amount present in the root zone sub model y pef cu which takes into account the irrigation applied to the crop the effective precipitation and the deep percolation in the different zones of the plot due to cu sub model y pef s cu which takes into account the irrigation applied to the crop the effective precipitation the initial water amount present in the root zone and the deep percolation in the different zones of the plot due to cu 2 4 1 sub model y this is the simplest optimization sub model in which the eta is assumed to be equal to the amount of irrigation water applied and eta r 16 e t a i r i r i where ri is the irrigation depth applied in stage i mm this option can achieve good results in areas or crops in which the contribution of rain is practically negligible the soils are shallow and irrigation systems with a high water allocation uniformity are used 2 4 2 sub model y pef this model is somewhat more complex than the previous one the level of precision increases facilitating a more exact distribution of the available irrigation water taking into account the precipitation contributions in each stage 17 e t a i r i p e f i r i where pefi is the effective precipitation throughout stage i mm ri is the irrigation depth applied in stage i mm in rainy areas and or with crops that show significant differences in the amount of precipitation received in the different development stages this option can provide significant improvements with respect to eq 16 2 4 3 sub model y pef s including the initial soil water content in the daily balance complicates the eta r calculation as this depends on irrigation r and consequently the amount of irrigation water to be applied in each stage from eq 2 and from the daily water balance performed by mopeco the eta r value is determined as 18 e t a i r i c 1 i i v o l i n c r r d i r i p e f i p w p r d i 1 a d l i p w p r d i e t m i where c1ii is the water content in the soil occupied by the crop roots at the beginning of stage i mm volincrrdi is the water volume stored in the soil which the crop can access by increasing root depth throughout stage i ri is the irrigation applied across stage i mm pefi is the effective precipitation during stage i mm pwp is the soil water content at the permanent wilting point mm mm rdi is the root depth at the end of stage i and adli is the allowable depletion level in absolute terms at the end of stage i the equations used by this sub model depend on the soil moisture content in the previous stages this aspect is not considered in the mdm optimization method because for the sake of simplicity the stages are considered as being independent of each other thus a first optimization of irrigation distribution must be carried out with the sub model y pef to have an idea of the total irrigation applied in each stage having obtained the irrigation for each stage the initial soil state for each stage is then calculated and the irrigation schedule is optimized using the mdm optimization algorithm the separation between the calculation of the soil condition and the optimization process is necessary since the soil moisture content must be calculated for each stage starting from a valid solution that is from a distribution of irrigation whose sum is the total irrigation the optimization process acts independently in each of the stages and if the soil water content is updated for another stage the results may not be valid 2 4 4 sub model y pef cu this sub model is derived from the p pef sub model with the exception that the irrigation water is not uniformly distributed in the plot as the pef but according to uniformity coefficient cu fig 3 the average irrigation depth r i is distributed in the plot according to the cu value eq 3 the evapotranspiration on the whole plot is equal to the effective precipitation plus the area defined by the function representing the normal distribution of irrigation water in the plot in the subplot where ri pef etm the crop is considered to only evapotranspirate etm with excess water being eliminated by leaching fig 3 to solve the irrigation integral gnu maxima computer algebra software was used 19 r i p e f i e t m i φ r i p e f i e t m i c v i r i where n x is the normal function 2 4 5 sub model y pef s cu in this optimization sub model the integral to be solved is more complex than in the previous sub model y pef cu it is necessary to consider the soil water content at the beginning of each development stage which will be different in each of the n subplots into which the irrigated area is divided section 2 2 this means that the algebraic resolution of the irrigation integral is not viable and thus its resolution must be resolved numerically using the y pef s sub model as a basis this sub model is solved by determining the eta r value for each of the subplots to take into account the lack of uniformity of the irrigation system the methodology used in the y pef s sub model is then applied to each one the value of eta r is obtained by integrating the eta r value of each subplot fig 4 consequently this algorithm is the slowest of all those proposed but is able to obtain the most precise results given that it considers the greatest number of variables 2 5 determination of irrigation scheduling to calculate irrigation scheduling based on desired total irrigation the mdm optimizer solution was used which indicates the target eta etm ratios for each stage referring to a properly irrigated area this determines the daily irrigation required to maintain the crop evapotranspiration within the target eta etm ratios for each crop stage to do this the daily soil water balance is performed in each subplot to take cu into account converting these irrigations to pa 50 using the multiplicative factor for that area eq 8 if sub models obtained by simplifying the mopeco simulator are used in the optimization process when simulating the irrigation scheduling obtained by the mdm optimizer there will evidently be deviations between the total water used by the simulator and the total desired irrigation generally the more complex the sub model of optimization used the smaller this deviation will be nevertheless the total irrigation objective can easily be obtained with successive approximations to do this the total irrigation included in the mdm optimizer can be modified until the total irrigation distributed by the simulator reaches the target level thus using a modification of muller s method muller 1956 the optimal calendar of irrigations with an error of 0 001 mm can be obtained using between only 5 and 8 iterations to obtain a complete crop response curve using 100 points performing the iterations is unnecessary since the crop response is obtained by optimizing different target total irrigations using the total irrigation obtained by the simulator 2 5 1 evaluation of optimization sub models to evaluate the methodologies developed for the generation of optimum irrigation scheduling during the crop cycle three crops were chosen barley maize and onion which were calibrated for the mopeco model under conditions in castilla la mancha spain domínguez et al 2012b c pardo 2018 table 1 the necessary economic data for the transformation of the y vs in functions in gm vs ig table 2 are also available domínguez et al 2017 20 g m y s p v c i g w c s u b s where gm is the gross margin ha 1 y is the yield kg ha 1 sp is the sale price of the harvest kg 1 vc is the variable costs associated with the crop ha 1 ig is the gross irrigation applied to the crop m3 ha 1 wc is the water cost m 3 and subs are the cap common agricultural policy of the european union subsidies ha 1 in this work a permanent sprinkler irrigation system was considered with evaporation and drift losses of 10 ortiz et al 2010 which are added to in to calculate ig the climatic data used in the simulations correspond to the typical humid intermediate and dry meteorological years tmy domínguez et al 2013 hall et al 1978 based on 54 years of climate series recorded at albacete weather station leite et al 2015 fig 5 the simulation of 300 000 random irrigation schedules with mopeco for the economic table 2 and climatic conditions fig 5 considered in this study allows the pareto frontier of each crop to be determined when establishing the random irrigation schedule the eta etm ratios to be reached in each stage were progressively increased from 0 to 1 and the area adequately irrigated pa from 0 001 to 0 999 therefore many of these irrigation schedules do not make agronomic sense since it is not possible for a crop to achieve a particular yield if the eta etm ratio is very close to 0 in any of its stages or with very small pa values therefore for the evaluation of the 5 sub models only the irrigation schedules that comply with the restrictions imposed by the ordi methodology were used domínguez et al 2012a the minimum eta etm ratio to be reached at each crop development stage should be 0 5 and the maximum 1 during the establishment stage ky i eta etm 0 8 is set in order to favor crop emergence the maximum difference in deficit between consecutive development stages e t a e t m i e t a e t m i 1 must be limited to prevent an excessive deficit in one stage conditioning crop development in the next in the case of barley maize and onion these values are 0 3 0 3 and 0 4 respectively in addition to analyze the results obtained with the different optimization sub models using a variable deficit in the different crop stages two aspects must be considered a the sub model achieving the highest gm for the irrigation water available and b the sub model achieving a better fit to the pareto boundary in section b which is located between the point of tangency of the gm curve with the straight line passing through the origin p2 until the point of maximum gm p3 fig 6 this part of the function is then used to determine optimal crop distribution on the farm section a is not relevant given that it is preferable to leave part of the farm unirrigated and apply an irrigation depth equal to that determined by p2 to the irrigated area lópez mata et al 2016 section c p3 p4 is not relevant either since it will never be beneficial to apply greater water volume than that necessary to achieve a particular gm 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the methodologies developed mopeco simulated 300 000 random irrigation schedules for barley maize and onion fig 7 a b and c under wet intermediate and dry typical conditions fig 7a b and c according to the results only 12 4 on average meet the ordi requirements for barley 6 7 for maize and 3 4 for onions since climatology conditions the minimum irrigation water that must be applied to each crop it was not possible to find irrigation schedules for an intermediate tmy that are compatible with ordi when the irrigation water applied is less than about 125 mm in the case of barley 250 mm in maize and 450 mm in onion fig 7ab bb and cb the pareto frontier is clearly defined black line in fig 7 showing that for cu 85 and pa 50 it is possible to increase the plot yield applying an irrigation depth higher than the crop requirements black dot in fig 7 this result justifies why in conditions of low water price and or high water availability farmers usually uses this irrigation strategy nevertheless it must be borne in mind that once the point corresponding to pa 50 has been exceeded the slope of the curve usually tends rapidly to 0 consequently the agronomic water productivity also decreases at that rate therefore the improvement in yield involves unjustifiable water expenditure from both the economic perspective and that of the sustainability of the agricultural systems given that increasingly less water is available for agriculture due to climate change and the priority for other uses such as urban supply and the environment the best way to reduce this effect is to raise farmers awareness of the importance of properly maintaining and managing their irrigation systems in order to achieve high cu values nascimento et al 2019 carried out an experiment with irrigated maize in albacete spain in order to compare the traditional irrigation schedule applied by a farmer with the theoretical one aiming to fulfill the irrigation requirements of the crop without considering the uniformity of the irrigation system their results showed that the traditional schedule increased the amount of water supplied to the crop 17 the yield 8 and the profitability of the plot 22 while the water productivity of the theoretical schedule was 7 8 higher these results were conditioned by both the low cu value 83 5 and the irrigation water cost 0 07 m 3 the economic data associated with each crop table 2 allowed the y vs in functions fig 7 to be transformed into gm vs ig fig 8 eq 20 as expected the wet tmys achieve the highest economic profitability because the maximum yield is reached by applying less irrigation water fig 7aa ba and ca the loss of agronomic productivity as a result of the lack of uniformity in irrigation water applied means maximum economic profitability fig 8 is reached before achieving the potential yield for the whole plot fig 7 in the case of barley the maximum gm is achieved even before applying the maximum crop irrigation requirements for pa 50 black dot in fig 8a in contrast for maize the maximum gm is obtained for a value of pa 70 and for onion of pa 77 fig 8b and c these results are due to the different effect of irrigation water cost on the total profitability of each crop consequently in the most profitable crops it may be economically advisable to apply an irrigation depth higher than the maximum crop requirements when the cu is not high however this may be contrary to the sustainability of agricultural systems in areas with water scarcity since the increase in irrigation water generates very little economic productivity famers in castilla la mancha who use deficit irrigation in barley are empirically aware of this behavior however in order to achieve maximum profitability for the irrigation volume applied it is necessary for farmers to use ordi methodology to this end it would be necessary to provide the productive sector with models and tools to advise on how to schedule optimized regulated deficit irrigation when comparing the gm vs ig function formed by the ordi pareto frontier fig 9 with the gm vs ig functions of the different submodels together with the results of using a constant deficit in all crop stages it can be observed that crop type and climatic conditions affect the fit achieved by each sub model bearing in mind that the objective of each of the optimization sub models is for the gm to be as close as possible to the maximum obtained by the ordi pareto frontier for each applied irrigation depth the results of the different submodels in section b were analyzed due to their being the most beneficial from an economic point of view lópez mata et al 2016 fig 6 in general the most complex submodel y pef s cu achieves the best fit with barley for the wet tmy being the only exception within the studied cases however in other sections of the function the best fits are achieved by other sub models therefore since no optimization sub model stands out clearly from the rest in all sections of gm vs ig it is proposed to calculate all of them for use in the direct solution algorithm that determines the optimal crop distribution lópez mata et al 2016 the results also show the highest gm achieved by the ordi methodology with respect to the constant deficit in all crop stages the average calculation time needed to generate the gm vs ig curves for each sub model by using 100 points is very low between 0 6 for the simplest sub model and 1 3 for the most complex if all sub models are calculated the time is 3 9 on average using a single core of an q9550 intel processor at 2 83 ghz which is perfectly acceptable for use in a web application with a large number of users evidently only simulating 100 irrigation schedules per sub model to obtain the y vs in function considerably reduces the calculation time with respect to the option of calculating 300 000 irrigation schedules fig 9 despite being able to obtain slightly higher gm this latter option is not acceptable for web applications due to its high calculation time 30 it would cause a significant slowdown in the system when used massively by a large number of users 4 conclusions the 5 sub models developed in this work are capable of generating gross margin vs gross irrigation gm vs ig functions with a highly similar level of precision to the function obtained with the pareto frontier determined by the simulation of 300 000 random irrigation schedules calculation times are low between 0 6 and 1 3 and acceptable for application in online tools for large scale use sub model y pef s cu which takes into account the yield effective precipitation and the uniformity of water in soil achieves the best fit to the gm vs ig function however the best solution is to use all the sub models together to determine the gm vs ig function due to the low calculation time 3 9 of this option reaches a better solution in farms where irrigation uniformity and the price of water are low and the harvest price is high farmers may increase the profitability of their plots by supplying a greater irrigation depth than the maximum requirements of the crop thus compensating for the effect of the lack of uniformity on yield nevertheless this option increases the negative impact of agriculture on the environment and must be avoided consequently it is necessary to establish awareness policies and carry out training programs to promote the adequate management and maintenance of irrigation systems in order to achieve high uniformity and efficiency when applying irrigation water for crops whose profitability is significantly affected by the amount of irrigation

10910,mopeco uses the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology to determine the irrigation schedule that maximizes the gross margin gm of annual crops when the availability of irrigation water is limited to this end it is necessary to determine the functions that relate gm to the gross irrigation water ig supplied to the crop given that mopeco is designed for implementation by farmers using online tools the time required to obtain the gm vs ig function must be low thus the objective was to develop and validate a methodology to generate the most accurate gm vs ig function with a low calculation time that takes into consideration the effect of irrigation uniformity on final yield five sub models were developed and evaluated with barley onion and maize for the semi arid conditions of castilla la mancha spain the sub models included one or more of the following variables yield y effective precipitation pef soil moisture s and its distribution uniformity at plot level cu the sub model y pef s cu achieved the best fitting the other sub models y y pef y pef s and y pef cu provided solutions that were very close to the optimum with low calculation time nevertheless the best fit of each sub model to the optimum function was achieved in different sections of this function therefore the five sub models are complementary and it is advisable to use them simultaneously thanks to their low calculation time requirements 3 9 s the validation with the three crops showed that in farms where irrigation uniformity and water price are low and harvest price is high it is economically advisable to apply higher irrigation depths than the crop irrigation requirements nevertheless as improving agricultural water productivity is key for sustaining the environment tools like mopeco may help to maximize gm and increase water use efficiency by means of deficit irrigation strategies keywords mopeco ordi water productivity irrigation uniformity 1 introduction in order to improve irrigation management on farms numerous growth simulation models have been developed and calibrated such as cropsyst stockle et al 1994 pilote mailhol et al 1997 wofost boogaard et al 1998 daisy abrahamsen and hansen 2000 apsim keating et al 2003 mopeco ortega et al 2004 and aquacrop steduto et al 2009 among others all these models are able to simulate the crop yield from a particular irrigation schedule given the climatic conditions with varying degrees of precision however mopeco is the only model that uses the methodology of optimized regulated deficit irrigation by stages ordi domínguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015 to determine the irrigation scheduling that maximizes the gross margin gm of the crop with a limited amount of available irrigation water this considerably increases its usefulness as an irrigation management tool in farms with water scarce conditions domínguez et al 2017 in this sense some authors have used the previous models to determine the irrigation schedule that optimizes crop yield and even the profitability of farms developing their own algorithms or using other pre existing ones akhtar et al 2013 geerts et al 2010 kloss et al 2012 linker et al 2016 moreover ordi methodology can be improved when determining the optimal irrigation schedule if we take into account the levels of deficit reached in each stage of crop development as a result of irrigation water uniformity the amount of water available in the root zone or the amount of rain forecast as with any optimization problem the time taken to obtain the results and their accuracy depend on the process used in the case of optimization of irrigation scheduling most authors resort to metaheuristic techniques de paly and zell 2009 garg and dadhich 2014 lalehzari et al 2015 perea et al 2016 tong and guo 2013 tsang and jim 2016 metaheuristic methods aim to reach a solution that is close or even equal to the optimal solution by means of progressive improvement in the results obtained by the optimizer which involves extremely high computational requirements the use of this methodology is justified by the difficulty of developing a direct solution algorithm that calculates a single result equal to the optimal solution which must be compatible with the use of crop simulation models that require a large amount of data and variables for their operation ioslovich et al 2012 the importance of the rapid mathematical resolution of optimal irrigation scheduling calculation lies in being able to offer this tool to a large number of online users in this case the computational requirements are proportional to the number of users to be served at a given time furthermore the greater the number of variables considered the more complex the optimization problem to be solved may be and the more accurate might be the results in this sense the main variables considered by the mopeco model that can be used in the optimization process are crop yield y effective precipitation pef quantity of water available in the root zone s and uniformity of water distribution in the soil after its application in the plot by the irrigation system cu lópez mata et al 2010 the aim of this work was to develop a methodology based on ordi for optimal irrigation scheduling calculation that quickly and efficiently maximizes the gm vs ig function of each crop while being compatible with the mopeco model to achieve this three specific objectives were proposed i to develop five sub models for a rapid determination of optimal irrigation scheduling based on a yield y b yield and effective precipitation y pef c yield effective precipitation and the amount of available water in the soil y pef s d yield effective precipitation and the water uniformity in the soil y pef cu and e yield effective precipitation and the amount and uniformity of water in the soil y pef s cu ii to develop a methodology that takes into account the effect on crop yield of irrigation water uniformity in the soil iii to validate the different sub models and determine which one obtains the gm vs ig functions that best fit the pareto frontier generated through 300 000 random simulations of three crops barley maize and onion and three different climatic conditions dry intermediate and wet year 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation of crop yield to estimate the crop yield mopeco uses the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 1 y y m a x i 1 n 1 k y i 1 e t a i e t m i where y is the crop yield kg ha 1 ymax is the maximum crop yield without water stress and other constraints kg ha 1 ky is the crop sensitivity coefficient to water stress for each stage doorenbos and kassam 1979 and eta and etm are the actual and maximum accumulated crop evapotranspiration respectively for each of the n stages considered mm the duration of development stages is based on the accumulated growing degree day gdd method which is calculated using double triangulation methodology sevacherian et al 1977 this methodology requires the daily maximum and minimum temperature the threshold temperatures between which the normal development of the crop takes place and the duration in gdd of each phenological stage considered for the daily calculation of etm the model uses the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 which requires the daily values of the crop coefficient kc doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and the daily reference evapotranspiration eto to calculate eta it is necessary to perform a daily water balance in the soil in which the inputs are pef nrcs 2004 and the net irrigation while the outputs are the eta and the deep percolation losses in this sense the model considers three soil horizons the first is occupied by the roots the second is that being colonized by the roots when they grow during the vegetative development stage and the third is that which will never be reached by the roots and therefore the water that reaches that level is considered as water lost through deep percolation domínguez et al 2011 in the daily soil water balance the eta value depends on the atmospheric evaporative demand and the soil water content if this is higher than the allowable depletion level adl defined as the fraction of total available water taw that a crop can use without going into water stress then eta etm otherwise the crop will start to suffer water stress and eta etm which is calculated according to the equation proposed by allen et al 1998 2 e t a n e t m n i f c 1 n a d l n e t m n c 1 n p w p r d n a d l n p w p r d n i f a d l n c 1 n p w p r d n where c1n is the water content in the soil occupied by the crop roots at time n with it being necessary to perform a daily balance of the soil water content adl is the permissible depletion level of the crop in relative terms to field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp adln is the permissible depletion level in absolute terms considering the crop root depth at time n and rdn is the crop root depth at time n 2 2 simulation of the irrigation water uniformity effect on crop yield to simulate the effect on crop yield of irrigation uniformity and its subsequent redistribution in the root area mopeco divides the irrigated plot into n subplots 25 are sufficient in the cases analyzed and performs a daily water balance for each of them obtaining the yield at the end of the crop development cycle for each subplot by integrating the yields obtained in the set of soil fractions using a combination of simpson s 1 3 rule and 3 8 rule the total yield of the irrigated plot is obtained to calculate the irrigation water distribution in the different fractions of the plot the model uses christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 together with the irrigation water distribution in the plot fitted to a normal cumulative function heermann et al 1992 warrick et al 1989 consequently the amount of water received by each of the n considered fractions can be calculated from the variation coefficient cv and the average irrigation depth applied r fig 1 the value of cu will be that estimated or measured for the set of irrigation events performed in the plot depending on the irrigation system used and the management and maintenance level implemented lópez mata et al 2010 3 c u 1 i 1 w v i v w v 100 4 c v 1 c u 100 2 π where cu is christiansen s uniformity coefficient vi is the water volume collected at the w control points mm v is the average of all the volumes mm and cv is the coefficient of variation of the volume of irrigation water that reaches the ground for a normal distribution the percentage of the area adequately irrigated pa describes the proportion of the plot that receives at least the amount of predetermined irrigation water r the rest of the plot will receive an irrigation depth of less than r thus 5 p a 1 φ m 1 c v 6 m r r where φ is the probability distribution function of normal distribution which has no analytical expression so it is necessary to resort to a numerical approximation such as that of abramowitz and stegun 1966 with a maximum error of 7 5 10 8 cv is the variation coefficient eq 4 m is the multiplier that allows the average irrigation depth applied to the whole plot r to be transformed into the irrigation depth received by each of the subplots into which the plot has been divided both eq 1 and the ordi methodology establish that the maximum eta etm ratio that can be reached in a particular stage of crop development is 1 which is equivalent to the maximum crop requirements therefore higher irrigation depths should not be applied since the result would be a loss in irrigation water productivity due to leaching in any event this is not a problem for the model when calculating yield vs net irrigation y vs in without taking into account the irrigation supply uniformity or when this is close to 100 however with lower cu values the impossibility of obtaining the complete curve arises since mopeco performs irrigation programming at the midpoint of the plot that is at the plot point corresponding to a value of pa 50 this means that 50 of the plot receives a quantity of water lower than the etm decreasing the yield in the total plot it is then impossible to implement an irrigation schedule that applies an irrigation depth greater than the etm for 50 of the irrigated area in order to show this limitation the yield vs net irrigation function for sub model y is shown as an example fig 2 a when this methodology is applied for cu 75 to solve this limitation a methodology was developed that allows the pa value to be changed in order to reach values 50 the methodology is based on the irrigation scheduling calculated during the same crop stage using different pa values with the same calculation method being similar if the average irrigation applied r is the same 7 r i r i 1 m i 1 r i 2 m i 2 r i 1 1 φ 1 1 p a 1 c v i r i 2 1 φ 1 1 p a 2 c v i where r i is the average irrigation applied to the plot ri1 is the amount of irrigation water received by pa1 area which will be equal to r i by its multiplier mi1 ri2 is obtained for pa2 area in the same way and cvi is the variation coefficient of the irrigation depth applied in the stage in question with this value depending on the uniformity coefficient eq 5 to obtain an irrigation schedule for any desired water amount rtotal higher than the irrigation level obtained to satisfy the crop requirements eta etm 1 for pa 50 irrigation depth denominated rmax 50 the model calculates the pa value that achieves eta etm 1 by applying the amount of water rtotal 8 m r m a x 50 r t o t a l using multiplier m from eq 8 in eq 5 we obtain the pa value for an average irrigation depth equal to the total irrigation desired rtotal with eta etm 1 in all the crop stages hence the complete response curve of the crop for each sub model is obtained fig 2b 2 3 optimal distribution of irrigation water available at the farm to maximize yield the last step of the mopeco model is to determine the crop distribution on the farm that maximizes the gm by calculating the irrigable area and irrigation volume to be applied to each crop to do this it is previously necessary to determine the y vs in function that achieves the maximum yield for each net irrigation volume applied to each crop fig 2b as well as the irrigation schedule that achieves the maximum yield 9 r t o t a l r 1 r 2 r m 1 r m in the equation used by mopeco to estimate the crop yield eq 1 this depends on the eta etm ratio reached in each development stage ky which is significantly conditioned by irrigation water distribution during the season therefore the function to be optimized is a yield function that accepts each of the irrigations applied to the crop as parameters and which also determines the amount of irrigation water to be provided in each stage of crop development to achieve combinations of eta etm that obtain the maximum yield this concept is the basis of the ordi methodology domínguez et al 2012a 10 y r 1 r 2 r m 1 r m f 1 r 1 r a f 2 r 1 r b f n r 1 r m where n is the number of crop stages considered and m the number of irrigations events applied the irrigation and rainfall distribution means that the daily eta etm value is not constant over time since it depends on the soil water content and the climatic conditions on each day however in order to simplify the optimization process in this work it was assumed to be possible to implement an irrigation distribution in such a way that the daily eta etm ratio remains constant throughout each development stage average value for the stage and is equal to the target eta etm ratio corresponding to the entire stage with this assumption the irrigations established to achieve the target eta etm relationship in each stage can be grouped into a single irrigation it was also assumed that the stages are independent of each other in order to avoid the effect on eta etm of the amount of soil available water at the beginning of the next development stage in this way in the yield function to be maximized the factor value of each stage only depends on the total amount of irrigation water applied to each one eq 11 11 y r 1 r 2 r n 1 r n f 1 r 1 f 2 r 2 f n 1 r n 1 f n r n 12 r t o t a l r 1 r 2 r n where n is the number of growing stages considered for the mopeco model each of the factors corresponding to the ky stages in eq 11 can be expressed as according to eq 1 13 f i r i 1 k y i 1 e t a i r i e t m i during the optimization process the only unknown variable in eq 13 is irrigation r since a previously calibrated value of ky is chosen for the crop and a priori known climatic data are used this allows the duration of each development stage and the corresponding value of etm to be determined eta r is the function that calculates the actual crop evapotranspiration in each development stage according to the irrigation applied being considered in this work as an optimization sub model in annex a it is mathematically demonstrated that the maximum crop yield for a limited irrigation water volume rtotal is obtained when the value of f i r i r i f i r i is the same for each of the development stages this value is called multiplier divided by the derivative of the multiplier mdm 14 m d m i r i f i r i r i f i r i 1 k y i 1 e t a i r i e t m i k y i e t m i r i e t a i r i if the functions mdmi ri of each stage are injective an optimization algorithm based on the search for the mdm value can be created where the sum of the irrigation events obtained for each of the stages ri is equal to the total desired irrigation rtotal thus the optimization problem instead of searching for n optimal values which are the irrigations for each stage involves finding only an mdm value regardless of the number of stages in this way the computational complexity is greatly reduced therefore the optimization algorithm is based on solving eq 15 15 f r t o t a l m d m i 1 n m d m i 1 m d m where the m d m i 1 m d m functions are the inverse functions of the m d m i r i function for each of the n crop stages when the irrigation uniformity effect is considered the mdm algorithm generates a distribution of the total desired irrigation rtotal for each stage however when assigning the irrigation that obtains a ratio of eta etm 1 which would be the maximum irrigation for pa 50 the optimizer cannot assign more irrigation than that established by the upper limits of each of the stages for this reason the methodology described in section 2 2 for changing the pa value was used eq 5 and 8 2 4 optimization sub models to determine the daily value of eta eq 2 in each subplot when the irrigation uniformity effect is considered fig 1 it is necessary to perform a daily water balance in each subplot for this the inputs are the water content in the root zone the irrigation water applied in each subplot eqs 3 6 and effective precipitation the balance outputs are the eta and the deep percolation losses domínguez et al 2011 the greater the number of these factors taken into account when determining the etai ri value in eq 13 the more complex are the calculation requirements of the algorithm to be developed thus five sub models were developed with an increasing level of complexity in order to determine whether greater calculation requirements achieve greater precision sub model y in which to calculate the soil water balance and determine the eta only the irrigation water applied to the crop is considered sub model y pef which takes into account the irrigation applied to the crop and the effective precipitation sub model y pef s which takes into account the irrigation applied to the crop the effective precipitation and the initial water amount present in the root zone sub model y pef cu which takes into account the irrigation applied to the crop the effective precipitation and the deep percolation in the different zones of the plot due to cu sub model y pef s cu which takes into account the irrigation applied to the crop the effective precipitation the initial water amount present in the root zone and the deep percolation in the different zones of the plot due to cu 2 4 1 sub model y this is the simplest optimization sub model in which the eta is assumed to be equal to the amount of irrigation water applied and eta r 16 e t a i r i r i where ri is the irrigation depth applied in stage i mm this option can achieve good results in areas or crops in which the contribution of rain is practically negligible the soils are shallow and irrigation systems with a high water allocation uniformity are used 2 4 2 sub model y pef this model is somewhat more complex than the previous one the level of precision increases facilitating a more exact distribution of the available irrigation water taking into account the precipitation contributions in each stage 17 e t a i r i p e f i r i where pefi is the effective precipitation throughout stage i mm ri is the irrigation depth applied in stage i mm in rainy areas and or with crops that show significant differences in the amount of precipitation received in the different development stages this option can provide significant improvements with respect to eq 16 2 4 3 sub model y pef s including the initial soil water content in the daily balance complicates the eta r calculation as this depends on irrigation r and consequently the amount of irrigation water to be applied in each stage from eq 2 and from the daily water balance performed by mopeco the eta r value is determined as 18 e t a i r i c 1 i i v o l i n c r r d i r i p e f i p w p r d i 1 a d l i p w p r d i e t m i where c1ii is the water content in the soil occupied by the crop roots at the beginning of stage i mm volincrrdi is the water volume stored in the soil which the crop can access by increasing root depth throughout stage i ri is the irrigation applied across stage i mm pefi is the effective precipitation during stage i mm pwp is the soil water content at the permanent wilting point mm mm rdi is the root depth at the end of stage i and adli is the allowable depletion level in absolute terms at the end of stage i the equations used by this sub model depend on the soil moisture content in the previous stages this aspect is not considered in the mdm optimization method because for the sake of simplicity the stages are considered as being independent of each other thus a first optimization of irrigation distribution must be carried out with the sub model y pef to have an idea of the total irrigation applied in each stage having obtained the irrigation for each stage the initial soil state for each stage is then calculated and the irrigation schedule is optimized using the mdm optimization algorithm the separation between the calculation of the soil condition and the optimization process is necessary since the soil moisture content must be calculated for each stage starting from a valid solution that is from a distribution of irrigation whose sum is the total irrigation the optimization process acts independently in each of the stages and if the soil water content is updated for another stage the results may not be valid 2 4 4 sub model y pef cu this sub model is derived from the p pef sub model with the exception that the irrigation water is not uniformly distributed in the plot as the pef but according to uniformity coefficient cu fig 3 the average irrigation depth r i is distributed in the plot according to the cu value eq 3 the evapotranspiration on the whole plot is equal to the effective precipitation plus the area defined by the function representing the normal distribution of irrigation water in the plot in the subplot where ri pef etm the crop is considered to only evapotranspirate etm with excess water being eliminated by leaching fig 3 to solve the irrigation integral gnu maxima computer algebra software was used 19 r i p e f i e t m i φ r i p e f i e t m i c v i r i where n x is the normal function 2 4 5 sub model y pef s cu in this optimization sub model the integral to be solved is more complex than in the previous sub model y pef cu it is necessary to consider the soil water content at the beginning of each development stage which will be different in each of the n subplots into which the irrigated area is divided section 2 2 this means that the algebraic resolution of the irrigation integral is not viable and thus its resolution must be resolved numerically using the y pef s sub model as a basis this sub model is solved by determining the eta r value for each of the subplots to take into account the lack of uniformity of the irrigation system the methodology used in the y pef s sub model is then applied to each one the value of eta r is obtained by integrating the eta r value of each subplot fig 4 consequently this algorithm is the slowest of all those proposed but is able to obtain the most precise results given that it considers the greatest number of variables 2 5 determination of irrigation scheduling to calculate irrigation scheduling based on desired total irrigation the mdm optimizer solution was used which indicates the target eta etm ratios for each stage referring to a properly irrigated area this determines the daily irrigation required to maintain the crop evapotranspiration within the target eta etm ratios for each crop stage to do this the daily soil water balance is performed in each subplot to take cu into account converting these irrigations to pa 50 using the multiplicative factor for that area eq 8 if sub models obtained by simplifying the mopeco simulator are used in the optimization process when simulating the irrigation scheduling obtained by the mdm optimizer there will evidently be deviations between the total water used by the simulator and the total desired irrigation generally the more complex the sub model of optimization used the smaller this deviation will be nevertheless the total irrigation objective can easily be obtained with successive approximations to do this the total irrigation included in the mdm optimizer can be modified until the total irrigation distributed by the simulator reaches the target level thus using a modification of muller s method muller 1956 the optimal calendar of irrigations with an error of 0 001 mm can be obtained using between only 5 and 8 iterations to obtain a complete crop response curve using 100 points performing the iterations is unnecessary since the crop response is obtained by optimizing different target total irrigations using the total irrigation obtained by the simulator 2 5 1 evaluation of optimization sub models to evaluate the methodologies developed for the generation of optimum irrigation scheduling during the crop cycle three crops were chosen barley maize and onion which were calibrated for the mopeco model under conditions in castilla la mancha spain domínguez et al 2012b c pardo 2018 table 1 the necessary economic data for the transformation of the y vs in functions in gm vs ig table 2 are also available domínguez et al 2017 20 g m y s p v c i g w c s u b s where gm is the gross margin ha 1 y is the yield kg ha 1 sp is the sale price of the harvest kg 1 vc is the variable costs associated with the crop ha 1 ig is the gross irrigation applied to the crop m3 ha 1 wc is the water cost m 3 and subs are the cap common agricultural policy of the european union subsidies ha 1 in this work a permanent sprinkler irrigation system was considered with evaporation and drift losses of 10 ortiz et al 2010 which are added to in to calculate ig the climatic data used in the simulations correspond to the typical humid intermediate and dry meteorological years tmy domínguez et al 2013 hall et al 1978 based on 54 years of climate series recorded at albacete weather station leite et al 2015 fig 5 the simulation of 300 000 random irrigation schedules with mopeco for the economic table 2 and climatic conditions fig 5 considered in this study allows the pareto frontier of each crop to be determined when establishing the random irrigation schedule the eta etm ratios to be reached in each stage were progressively increased from 0 to 1 and the area adequately irrigated pa from 0 001 to 0 999 therefore many of these irrigation schedules do not make agronomic sense since it is not possible for a crop to achieve a particular yield if the eta etm ratio is very close to 0 in any of its stages or with very small pa values therefore for the evaluation of the 5 sub models only the irrigation schedules that comply with the restrictions imposed by the ordi methodology were used domínguez et al 2012a the minimum eta etm ratio to be reached at each crop development stage should be 0 5 and the maximum 1 during the establishment stage ky i eta etm 0 8 is set in order to favor crop emergence the maximum difference in deficit between consecutive development stages e t a e t m i e t a e t m i 1 must be limited to prevent an excessive deficit in one stage conditioning crop development in the next in the case of barley maize and onion these values are 0 3 0 3 and 0 4 respectively in addition to analyze the results obtained with the different optimization sub models using a variable deficit in the different crop stages two aspects must be considered a the sub model achieving the highest gm for the irrigation water available and b the sub model achieving a better fit to the pareto boundary in section b which is located between the point of tangency of the gm curve with the straight line passing through the origin p2 until the point of maximum gm p3 fig 6 this part of the function is then used to determine optimal crop distribution on the farm section a is not relevant given that it is preferable to leave part of the farm unirrigated and apply an irrigation depth equal to that determined by p2 to the irrigated area lópez mata et al 2016 section c p3 p4 is not relevant either since it will never be beneficial to apply greater water volume than that necessary to achieve a particular gm 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the methodologies developed mopeco simulated 300 000 random irrigation schedules for barley maize and onion fig 7 a b and c under wet intermediate and dry typical conditions fig 7a b and c according to the results only 12 4 on average meet the ordi requirements for barley 6 7 for maize and 3 4 for onions since climatology conditions the minimum irrigation water that must be applied to each crop it was not possible to find irrigation schedules for an intermediate tmy that are compatible with ordi when the irrigation water applied is less than about 125 mm in the case of barley 250 mm in maize and 450 mm in onion fig 7ab bb and cb the pareto frontier is clearly defined black line in fig 7 showing that for cu 85 and pa 50 it is possible to increase the plot yield applying an irrigation depth higher than the crop requirements black dot in fig 7 this result justifies why in conditions of low water price and or high water availability farmers usually uses this irrigation strategy nevertheless it must be borne in mind that once the point corresponding to pa 50 has been exceeded the slope of the curve usually tends rapidly to 0 consequently the agronomic water productivity also decreases at that rate therefore the improvement in yield involves unjustifiable water expenditure from both the economic perspective and that of the sustainability of the agricultural systems given that increasingly less water is available for agriculture due to climate change and the priority for other uses such as urban supply and the environment the best way to reduce this effect is to raise farmers awareness of the importance of properly maintaining and managing their irrigation systems in order to achieve high cu values nascimento et al 2019 carried out an experiment with irrigated maize in albacete spain in order to compare the traditional irrigation schedule applied by a farmer with the theoretical one aiming to fulfill the irrigation requirements of the crop without considering the uniformity of the irrigation system their results showed that the traditional schedule increased the amount of water supplied to the crop 17 the yield 8 and the profitability of the plot 22 while the water productivity of the theoretical schedule was 7 8 higher these results were conditioned by both the low cu value 83 5 and the irrigation water cost 0 07 m 3 the economic data associated with each crop table 2 allowed the y vs in functions fig 7 to be transformed into gm vs ig fig 8 eq 20 as expected the wet tmys achieve the highest economic profitability because the maximum yield is reached by applying less irrigation water fig 7aa ba and ca the loss of agronomic productivity as a result of the lack of uniformity in irrigation water applied means maximum economic profitability fig 8 is reached before achieving the potential yield for the whole plot fig 7 in the case of barley the maximum gm is achieved even before applying the maximum crop irrigation requirements for pa 50 black dot in fig 8a in contrast for maize the maximum gm is obtained for a value of pa 70 and for onion of pa 77 fig 8b and c these results are due to the different effect of irrigation water cost on the total profitability of each crop consequently in the most profitable crops it may be economically advisable to apply an irrigation depth higher than the maximum crop requirements when the cu is not high however this may be contrary to the sustainability of agricultural systems in areas with water scarcity since the increase in irrigation water generates very little economic productivity famers in castilla la mancha who use deficit irrigation in barley are empirically aware of this behavior however in order to achieve maximum profitability for the irrigation volume applied it is necessary for farmers to use ordi methodology to this end it would be necessary to provide the productive sector with models and tools to advise on how to schedule optimized regulated deficit irrigation when comparing the gm vs ig function formed by the ordi pareto frontier fig 9 with the gm vs ig functions of the different submodels together with the results of using a constant deficit in all crop stages it can be observed that crop type and climatic conditions affect the fit achieved by each sub model bearing in mind that the objective of each of the optimization sub models is for the gm to be as close as possible to the maximum obtained by the ordi pareto frontier for each applied irrigation depth the results of the different submodels in section b were analyzed due to their being the most beneficial from an economic point of view lópez mata et al 2016 fig 6 in general the most complex submodel y pef s cu achieves the best fit with barley for the wet tmy being the only exception within the studied cases however in other sections of the function the best fits are achieved by other sub models therefore since no optimization sub model stands out clearly from the rest in all sections of gm vs ig it is proposed to calculate all of them for use in the direct solution algorithm that determines the optimal crop distribution lópez mata et al 2016 the results also show the highest gm achieved by the ordi methodology with respect to the constant deficit in all crop stages the average calculation time needed to generate the gm vs ig curves for each sub model by using 100 points is very low between 0 6 for the simplest sub model and 1 3 for the most complex if all sub models are calculated the time is 3 9 on average using a single core of an q9550 intel processor at 2 83 ghz which is perfectly acceptable for use in a web application with a large number of users evidently only simulating 100 irrigation schedules per sub model to obtain the y vs in function considerably reduces the calculation time with respect to the option of calculating 300 000 irrigation schedules fig 9 despite being able to obtain slightly higher gm this latter option is not acceptable for web applications due to its high calculation time 30 it would cause a significant slowdown in the system when used massively by a large number of users 4 conclusions the 5 sub models developed in this work are capable of generating gross margin vs gross irrigation gm vs ig functions with a highly similar level of precision to the function obtained with the pareto frontier determined by the simulation of 300 000 random irrigation schedules calculation times are low between 0 6 and 1 3 and acceptable for application in online tools for large scale use sub model y pef s cu which takes into account the yield effective precipitation and the uniformity of water in soil achieves the best fit to the gm vs ig function however the best solution is to use all the sub models together to determine the gm vs ig function due to the low calculation time 3 9 of this option reaches a better solution in farms where irrigation uniformity and the price of water are low and the harvest price is high farmers may increase the profitability of their plots by supplying a greater irrigation depth than the maximum requirements of the crop thus compensating for the effect of the lack of uniformity on yield nevertheless this option increases the negative impact of agriculture on the environment and must be avoided consequently it is necessary to establish awareness policies and carry out training programs to promote the adequate management and maintenance of irrigation systems in order to achieve high uniformity and efficiency when applying irrigation water for crops whose profitability is significantly affected by the amount of irrigation water applied it is recommended to use tools as mopeco to advise farmers on establishing irrigation schedules that maximize crops gm by using regulated deficit irrigation strategies as ordi

10911,a dense dike system has been built in the upstream floodplains of the vietnamese mekong delta allowing large scale rice production based on compartmentalized fields and optimized water management intensive cultivation has enabled farmers to greatly increase their rice productivity and augment the national food bowl however flood control structures have undermined the water retention capacity compromising various benefits of floodwaters for delta ecosystems effects are both internal and external to farming negative internal effects are the large investment requirements and higher farming costs negative externalities include increased flood damage reduced sediment flows saltwater intrusion and riverbank erosion in this study we assessed the effects of three dike agricultural system scenarios on delta level sustainability considering both internal and external effects direct and indirect costs were estimated using various methodologies and the literature our findings show that extensive development of high dikes on the floodplains is the least economical and most ecologically risky alternative in this scenario accelerated high dike construction exacted a cost 136 greater than the situation represented by the baseline year of 2011 externalities in this scenario contributed to rising economic losses in both aquaculture and agriculture the scenario of transforming high dike into low dike systems revealed lower water management costs combined with lesser environmental impacts and greater capacity to exploit floodwater benefits our findings provide a useful input for decision makers considering the unintended economic consequences of existing water management strategies they support a transition to low dike farming systems for a more sustainable delta keywords rice production mekong sediment salinity intrusion flood risk sustainability 1 introduction in deltas worldwide downstream areas are influenced by human interventions upstream particularly where agricultural intensification is paired with extensive infrastructure for flood protection and water management large dams on the yangtze river for example have trapped natural sediment within reservoirs reducing sediment deposition downstream and causing riverbank erosion yang et al 2014 tessler et al 2017 estimated the effects of large dams on sediment fluxes for 46 deltas globally according to their calculations planned dams would reduce sediment fluxes in the danube by up to 60 and in the ganges brahmaputra meghna by some 21 in the danube hein et al 2016 reported on threats to ecosystem services arising from land use changes river regulation and dam construction over time for example increased flooding was observed in various regions of the catchment alongside increased pollution loads and loss of physical habitat diversity these outcomes have prompted governments to undertake restoration programs aiming to reconnect floodplains with their main rivers in order to increase nutrient and sediment retention and conserve floodplain ecosystems mcmillan and noe 2017 however the economic cost of such programs is high partly including cost of environmental degradation from the previous hardware programs guida et al 2016 upstream downstream problems are very evident on the vietnamese mekong delta vmd many studies have found increases in downstream flood damage salinity intrusion and riverbank erosion and reduced flows of fertile sediment this has been attributed to hydropower dam development upstream in the mekong river river diversion for irrigation land subsidence climate change and sea level rise hung 2012 hung et al 2014a manh et al 2014 2015 hoang et al 2016 dung et al 2018c these problems have been exacerbated by extensive construction of high dikes to enable triple rice production on the floodplains infrastructure such as the dense system of dikes and dams built since the 1990s alongside the growth of built up areas moreover restricts the space available for floodplain restoration on the vmd cosslett and cosslett 2014 environmental degradation is a real risk on the floodplains which before dike construction functioned as a natural water storage area mitigating flood damage and providing ecosystem services for a biologically productive and ecologically diverse region xuan and matsui 1998 to address the current problems and safeguard the delta effective water management strategies are needed a number of studies have assessed the impacts of upstream hydropower dam development river diversion for irrigation and climate change on vmd water regimes e g fredrik 2011 hung 2012 lauri et al 2012 lu et al 2014 manh et al 2014 richard and tran 2014 hoang et al 2016 while the upstream impacts have been relatively well covered the social and economic impacts of delta development processes remain poorly understood duong et al 2014 dang et al 2016 triet et al 2017 and dung et al 2018c looked at the implications of dike construction for floodwater regimes but they focused on hydraulic dynamics without considering social and economic influences some authors have considered the economic effects of dike construction but focused on specific locations see howie 2011 kien 2014 dan 2015 delta wide assessments have also been limited by lack of suitable methodologies and data constraints as a result externalities visible only at the delta level remain un quantified despite their acknowledged importance to our best knowledge no study has yet quantified the internal effects i e costs of dike construction and production systems and external effects e g increase in flood damage of extensive development of high dikes for triple rice production in the study region accelerated high dike construction for triple rice production has already widely impacted the vmd understanding the economic cost of dike related internalities and externalities is essential not only for formulating effective water management strategies but also for supporting decision makers in planning for a prosperous and sustainable delta as recommended in the mekong delta plan kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 this gap was filled by quantitatively assessing the internal and external effects of three dike agricultural system scenarios in a continuation of our previous work on the costs and benefits of flood protection and agricultural system alternatives at the farm level dung et al 2018a 2018b the current study assesses sustainability at the delta level our aim was to use cost benefit analysis to systematically quantify the internal and external impacts of several dike agricultural system scenarios for the vmd an economic methodology is used to test our hypothesis that the cost of high dike construction is greater than the benefits on the delta scale largely because development of such dikes reduces delta sustainability 2 study area the vmd spans 45 000 km2 of which some 39 400 km2 is in vietnam fig 1 located in the southernmost part of the river basin the vmd encompasses 13 provinces and major cities and is home to 18 million inhabitants the delta makes up 18 of the country s gdp mainly from fishery and agricultural production with an average per capita income of about us 2 217 in 2018 vna 2018 in our study the vmd was divided into two parts following the mekong delta plan the so called upstream delta floodplains and the downstream delta which includes the central and coastal zones the long xuyen quadrangle lxq and plain of reeds por are the vmd s two primary floodplains the world bank 2016 described these floodplains as natural sponges that regulate delta floodwaters by absorbing excess water in the flood season annually from july august to november december and releasing water back into the main streams in the dry season however as noted areas of double and triple rice production under low and high dike protection have greatly expanded across these floodplains in the last two decades this has halved the floodwater retention capacity of the lxq compared to 2000 dung et al 2018c both low dikes and high dikes are found on the floodplains low dikes hold back floodwaters long enough to allow production of two rice crops annually whereas high dikes block floodwaters completely allowing three three month rice crops per year dung and jacob 2017 large scale construction of high dikes however poses multiple risks to the delta in this study four such risks were considered all directly related to the floodplains reduced water retention capacity the first risk is downstream flooding dung et al 2018c triet et al 2017 the second is reduced flows of fertile sediment across the delta especially in the lxq due to the absence of dynamic interaction between rivers and floodplains during the flood season hung et al 2014a 2014b manh et al 2015 the third risk is salinity intrusion in the dry season though mainly caused by sea level rise and land subsidence salinity intrusion could be mitigated by the release of water retained within the floodplains smajgl et al 2015 hoang et al 2016 the fourth risk is riverbank erosion due to sudden increases in river flows such surges have been linked to reduced water retention capacity of the floodplains as well as to sediment retention by dams large scale sand mining in rivers and channels and land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction anthony et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 assessment of the costs and benefits of dike agricultural system scenarios an integrated assessment of dike agricultural system scenarios was conducted using cost benefit calculations and hydraulic modeling three scenarios were assessed the baseline representing the dike system in 2011 ed2011 full high dike development in 2030 hd2030 and full low dike development in 2030 ld2030 hd2030 can be considered the business as usual case as it assumes continued expansion of high dike agricultural systems particularly for intensive triple rice monoculture and vegetable production ld2030 represents an alternative development scheme characterized by a transition toward use of low dikes and floodwater friendly agriculture production particularly double rice production and floating crops e g floating rice lotus water mimosa and water lily hydraulic modeling was used to simulate dynamics of water levels and discharges as risks of downstream flood and potential river bank erosion of different dike agricultural system scenarios these risks were later evaluated by estimating the economic costs and benefits this model was developed based on the existing one dimensional 1 d hydraulic model with a quasi two dimensional 2 d approach using mike 11 software developed by the danish hydraulic institute the model used kinematic diffusive or fully dynamic vertically integrated equations for conservation of continuity and momentum the saint venant equations to solve complex ﬂow and mass transport problems dung et al 2018c the river network covers a domain of the whole mekong delta from kratie and the tonlé sap lake in cambodia to the river mouths in vietnam the model includes 5 million ha 4 084 river branches 13 000 cross sections and 21 235 computational nodes for the canal and water control infrastructure network sluice gates 14 weirs 2 246 and control structures 2 657 were identiﬁed representing the infrastructure system the model was calibrated and validated using observed flood hydrographs of 2011 and 2013 based on the discharge and water level time series from 15 gauging stations including 11 stations along the main rivers and 4 stations on the ﬂoodplains see dung et al 2018c for detailed description of input data parameters calibration and validation processes for each scenario 1 investment requirements and operational costs 2 production costs and revenues from agricultural systems and 3 externalities were calculated costs and benefits were derived from a literature review hydraulic modeling and field level empirical data calculations were done for 1 ha units then aggregated to the pan delta level using arc gis the sections below describe each step of the assessment 3 2 developing the scenarios the baseline scenario selected in this study represents the dike system of 2011 embedded with a historical extreme flood flood protection and water management are accomplished with a mix of low and high dikes the high dike triple rice production system is dominant in an giang province while the remaining of lxq and the por remains relatively open water with low dikes or no flood protection infrastructure the remaining two scenarios represent alternative futures for the vmd in terms of flood protection and water management and the corresponding agricultural production systems scenarios were based on three sources historic development trends 1990 2011 national and regional policy documents and development outlooks and the development strategy presented in the mekong delta plan see table a1 in the annex in essence hd2030 represents the current development trend that is gradual intensification and expansion of triple rice production by construction of high dikes for flood protection and water management under this scenario high dike construction spreads to the southwest and northeast thus the natural floodplains of the upper mekong delta are increasingly converted to agricultural lands especially for triple rice monoculture ld2030 considers an alternative that is a transformative change at the delta level in both flood risk management approach and in the intertwining agricultural production system there is a shift away from absolute flood prevention using high dikes preferred instead is controlled flooding which seeks to effectively and safely contain floodwaters within the system by increasing floodplain water retention capacity thereby reducing flood risk especially for downstream areas kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 in practical terms this latter option implies a backward transition from high dikes to low dikes and refraining from building new high dikes vmd agricultural systems would change as well instead of a triple rice monoculture double rice production would be combined with flood resilient crops during the flood season examples of these latter are lotus nelumbo nucifera and indigenous floating rice oryza prosative fig 2 visualizes the three scenarios 3 3 calculating investment and operational costs of scenarios the investment requirements for low and high dikes was derived from recent literature dan 2015 2015 dung et al 2018a kien 2014 operation and maintenance costs were referred from dan 2015 for each cost component cross study averages were calculated and these values were used for this study as the aim was to assess delta sustainability calculations of operation and maintenance costs were simplified by not taking into account annual discount rates for future scenarios as the area of annual dike construction could not be quantified given that the investment and operational costs were relatively homogeneous across the vmd floodplains a single cost estimate was applied for all locations in the delta see table a3 in the annex 3 4 calculating production costs and profit of agricultural systems the production costs and profit of agricultural systems were computed based on typical locations as surveyed by dung et al 2018a these served as proxies for the whole vmd in particular costs and profit were estimated for eight main agricultural systems in 117 sampled households at seven locations in an giang and dong thap provinces for the three years from 2014 to 2016 for each agricultural system production costs included fertilizer pesticides pumping costs and other this final category being mainly land preparation seed planting spraying harvesting and transport costs farm revenues were estimated using farmers reported crop yields and market prices again for the three years from 2014 to 2016 farm profit was then calculated as farm revenue minus production costs for double rice production costs and revenues averaged respectively in the range of us 1 537 1 713 and 3 070 4 088 for triple rice these figures were respectively 2 145 3 352 and 4 123 5 449 for vegetables costs and revenues were referenced from calculations for chili and sesame plus floating crops table a5 in the annex reports these for more detailed information on the calculation methods and results see dung et al 2018a 3 5 estimating externalities externalities of land use and water management systems are often abundant and multifaceted peng et al 2017 in this study the focus was on externalities already observed in the vmd or deemed highly likely in recent impact assessments in particular for each scenario the following externalities were considered changes in flood damage downstream changes in salinity intrusion in the coastal zone changes in suspended sediment carried by floodwaters and changes in riverbank erosion estimating direct monetary costs of externalities under the various scenarios was complicated by the fact that these externalities are not caused only by reduced floodwater retention capacity due to dike construction other factors are also at work such as hydropower development and climate change table a2 in the annex after quantifying the externalities based on data from our studies and the literature using simplified estimation methods the association between these externalities and floodplain water retention capacity were assessed fig 3 for this a proportional relationship was drawn between the dike construction area on the vmd floodplains and floodplain water retention capacity dung et al 2018c the methods used to quantify the externalities are presented below 3 5 1 flood risk complex computational methods are typically used for flood risk assessment winsemius et al 2013 these were simplified following wijayanti et al 2017 downstream flood risk was thus based on the spatial change in flooded area at various flood depths estimated under the three scenarios a geographic information system gis was used to interpolate the flooded area under each scenario with maximum water level data as simulated by a one dimensional quasi two dimensional 1d quasi2d hydraulic model for model setup and method see dung et al 2018b results were presented in both tabular and map form flood risk under the hd2030 and ld2030 scenarios was evaluated in relation to the baseline scenario ed2011 as such the impact of dike construction on the downstream flood risk was assessed by comparing the sizes of the downstream area flooded at different flood depths areas were defined as exposed to flood risk only if a flood depth greater than 1 m was registered because this is the depth at which aquaculture and flood based agriculture are disrupted balica et al 2014 economic costs of flooding were calculated using national statistics on losses in flooded areas in four years of extreme flooding 2000 2001 2002 and 2011 economic losses were then estimated from flooding for the hd2030 and ld2030 scenarios based on the percentage increase or decrease in flooded area compared to available data for the baseline year of 2011 3 5 2 salinity intrusion the vmd s two main rivers the tien and hau empty into the south china sea these rivers deliver large amounts floodwater to the floodplains via branches that can be diverted for irrigation and to flush away saltwater intrusion downstream in the dry season reduced flood retention capacity of the floodplains due to high dike construction could diminish this flushing capacity worsening salinity intrusion costs of salinity intrusion were estimated using rice yield reductions in a number of production areas affected in the extreme drought year of 2016 for the affected rice production area data were referenced from mard 2016 for yield reductions in rice which is a crop very sensitive to salinity nhan et al 2012 was used the economic losses were calculated by multiplying the economic loss for 1 ha by the affected rice production area ha the loss for 1 ha was computed by subtracting the net profit from 1 ha rice from the loss due to drought as provided by berg et al 2017 in their study in tien giang a coastal province of the vmd the reduction in rice yield is proportional to the salinity concentration see figure a1 in the annex the higher the salt concentration the lower yields will be in the vmd areas affected by salinity intrusion and salinity concentrations vary over the years salinity intrusion was mapped using contour lines provided by the southern institute for water resources research siwrr for the year 2008 and for 1998 2010 2015 and 2016 and the means for these years as provided by the southern institute for water resources planning siwrp the salinity data for 2008 were calibrated and verified by the siwrr using hydraulic modeling with an advection dispersion ad module while those of siwrp were drawn using observed data 3 5 3 sediment loss various studies have examined sediment loss on the floodplains as well as across the vmd for example hung et al 2014a measured fluvial sediment inside and outside dike compartments in dong thap province manh et al 2015 used hydraulic modeling to simulate sedimentation attributing reduced sediment load to hydropower dams and hydraulic works upstream dung et al 2018a found that fertilizer use had to be increased in rice farming systems under high dike protection compared to those in low dike areas to estimate the cost of reduced sedimentation was based on chapman et al 2016 these authors conducted a household survey interviewing 195 farmers in an giang province they computed the value of sediment using a set of components including the amount of fertilizer applied the average cost of fertilizer the cost efficiency gain per centimeter of sediment the average depth of sediment number of crops per year and area in production the annual value loss was then found by subtracting the annual value of sediment in low dike farming systems from that in high dike farming systems using the annual value loss economic losses due to reduced sediment load were calculated in our three scenarios by multiplying the average 1 ha sediment loss us year by the high dike area ha 3 5 4 riverbank erosion riverbank erosion is caused by human activities such as construction of upstream hydropower dams which change the flow of rivers and sand mining anthony et al 2015 riverbanks can also erode due to increased river discharges attributed to dike construction impacts of dike construction was quantified by analyzing changes in river discharge on the floodplains under the three scenarios for this the same 1d quasi2d hydraulic modeling simulations was used as applied in our flood risk estimates 4 results 4 1 internal cost and revenue of scenarios compared to our baseline ed2011 hd2030 with its greatly expanded high dike area has the greatest dike construction cost table 1 ld2030 with its low dikes presents the lowest cost specifically hd2030 implies a 136 greater investment and operational cost than ed2011 0 99 10 9 versus 0 42 109 investment and operational cost is much lower for the ld2030 scenario 0 05 109 for the high dikes in general investment and operational cost increases in proportion to the size of the high dike area regarding farm production hd2030 generates the lowest profit from both rice and vegetable production compared to ed2011 and ld2030 specifically the profit derived by converting all area to triple rice production as in hd2030 is us 0 81 10 9 profit from triple vegetable production is 3 54 10 9 both these estimates are lower than the profits calculated for ed2011 1 55 109 for rice and 4 33 109 for vegetables the profit from ld2030 is greater than that for hd2030 as 2 02 109 in profit can be gained from double rice production or 4 83 109 from double vegetable production combined with a floating crop the main reason why hd2030 returns such low profits lies in the increasing production costs of intensive farming systems over time e g due to rising need for fertilizer and pesticides leading to lower revenues compared to the other scenarios see also dung et al 2018a for rice production the total cost including dike construction investment and operational costs and farming inputs is highest for hd2030 4 34 10 9 compared to ed2011 2 50 109 and ld2030 1 32 109 the most costly agricultural system was vegetables if the entire area is developed with low dikes as in ld2030 10 38 109 compared to 7 95 10 9 and 1 32 10 9 however the total net profit is still highest for this full low dike scenario considering a double cropping cycle with vegetable production 4 75 109 remarkably the total net profit of hd2030 is lowest for production of both triple rice 0 97 109 and vegetables 1 76 109 compared to ed2011 respectively 0 8 109 and 3 57 109 and ld2030 1 93 109 and 4 75 109 4 2 externalities 4 2 1 flood risk results from the hydraulic modeling indicate greater risk of downstream flooding if high dikes are built on a large scale up to 2030 both area and depth of flooding increase under hd2030 but are generally reduced under ld2030 compared to ed2011 which represents the situation in 2011 fig 4 table 2 more specifically under hd2030 the area flooded to a depth of 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 m increases by respectively 8 3 and 8 compared to ed2011 in contrast under ld2030 the area flooded to a depth of 1 2 m increases by 5 but it decreases by 14 at the depths greater than 2 m compared to ed2011 regarding economic losses due to flooding under ed2011 losses due to flooding are 0 194 109 these increase by 19 to 0 231 109 under the full high dike development scenario hd2030 under ld2030 representing full implementation of low dikes economic losses are reduced by 9 to 0 177 109 compared to the baseline fig 5 4 2 2 salinity intrusion economic losses due to salinity intrusion were estimated by its direct impact in reducing rice yields for the area affected table 3 fig 6 maps areas affected by salinity intrusion the baseline scenario ed2011 presents a loss of 0 148 109 the loss under hd2030 is 10 higher due to increased salinity intrusion caused by reduced floodwater retention capacity of the floodplains 0 163 109 under ld2030 losses due to salinity intrusion are 10 less than in the baseline scenario that is 0 133 109 compared to 0 148 109 4 2 3 sediment loss diminished sediment load results in a potential economic loss of about us 110 for each hectare of agricultural land under high dike protection table 4 compared to the baseline scenario of ed2011 the economic loss due to reduced sedimentation increases by 155 under hd2030 from 0 033 109 to 0 084 109 under ld2030 the low dike scenario this loss is reduced by 70 from 0 033 109 to 0 010 109 4 2 4 riverbank and dike erosion compared to ed2011 the average discharge of delta rivers changes under hd2030 and ld2030 fig 7 hd2030 presents the greatest increase in river discharge whereas river discharge decreases under ld2030 the flood retention capacity of the floodplains is reduced under hd2030 raising floodwater discharge on the por and most of the lxq in the tien and hau rivers discharge increases by 0 1 0 6 rising also by 0 1 64 in the rivers along the boundaries of the lxq and por floodplains in some lxq rivers increases in flood discharge are caused by changes in floodwater distribution due to dike construction in contrast under ld2030 flood discharge decreases in most rivers thanks to the restoration of the water retention capacity of the floodplains here discharges of the main rivers decrease by 1 27 in the rivers along the lxq boundaries flood discharges increase by 2 326 due to greater floodwater volumes from the floodplains being released into the gulf of thailand 5 discussion a systematic cost benefit analysis of three vmd dike agricultural system scenarios was implemented demonstrating significant and differentiated hydrological and economic impacts for each while considerable recent literature has been dedicated to assessing and to some extent quantifying costs and benefits of land use and water management interventions our aim was to contribute a missing piece of the puzzle that is we sought to bring the delta wide and multidimensional implications of interventions into focus this section discusses our main findings and their implications for long term delta management and sustainability it then reflects on some limitations of the current study and recommendations for future research 5 1 main findings first results show that a land and water management strategy geared predominantly to flood prevention as represented by the hd2030 scenario is not economically and hydrologically feasible for the vmd in the long run our study found large scale high dike construction to be a costly option with dubious benefits in the long run upgrading the current situation to a full high dike system was found to be 136 more costly than the baseline 2011 dike system us 0 99 109 versus 0 42 109 this is equivalent to 11 of the agricultural earnings from the whole vmd region in 2010 siwrp 2012 in terms of farm production hd2030 returns the lowest profit and sometimes even resulted in losses for both rice and vegetables due to increasing production costs over time in addition to the considerable initial investment required for dike construction externalities are also prominent in the hd2030 scenario with the potential to cause economic losses of 0 478 109 equivalent to 50 to 25 the net profit gained from intensified rice to vegetable production see tables 1 and 5 other externalities that exact a high price under this scenario are the higher flood damage downstream and the reduction of natural sedimentation of the floodplains all in all these findings suggest a need to reconsider plans to expand high dike development in the future second sediment load was the externality most affected in our scenarios though with the smallest impact in absolute terms compared to the other externalities considered i e downstream flood damage salinity intrusion and riverbank erosion multiple studies have found that hydropower development upstream on the mekong river and expansion of high dike agricultural systems have led to reduced sediment in delta floodwaters kummu and varis 2007 hung 2012 hung et al 2014b manh et al 2014 2015 diminished inflows of fertile sediment with annual floodwaters reduces crop yields and productivity which represents a substantial economic loss for the delta extensive construction of high dikes for intensive crop production thus seems certain to diminish farm incomes and the delta economy lastly our study found a close relationship between the reduced flood retention capacity of the vmd floodplains and large scale high dike construction for rice production though floodplain water retention capacity is key to mitigate flood damage downstream and to reduce other unwanted externalities such as losses of sedimentation and mounting salinity intrusion there is an increasing trend toward high dike construction to enable triple rice production on the vmd floodplains mard 2015 in recent decades various countries have recognized floodwater control infrastructures as being at odds with sustainable development goals for economic social and environmental reasons multiple projects have been initiated to restore floodplains by replacing the concrete infrastructures built in years past with more environmentally appropriate systems vis et al 2003 temmerman et al 2013 van staveren et al 2014 roth and winnubst 2014 this again suggests that in vietnam construction of high dikes should be reconsidered in light of the current findings particularly the high long term costs demonstrated in the present study 5 2 implications for sustainable vmd management findings from this study are relevant for sustainable land and water management in the vmd in several ways at the farm level our calculated costs of salinity intrusion and sediment reduction see table 5 reveal the direct financial consequences of high dike development for rice production these externalities which result in increasing production costs over time suggest that intensive rice production on the vmd floodplains under high dike protection is financially unfeasible and unsustainable in the long run indeed farmers will likely need to increasingly use fertilizers to compensate for reduced sedimentation while salinization too will likely increasingly affect rice yields future planning and development of rice production systems would do well to consider such costs to ensure the longer term sustainability of farm earnings and delta livelihoods at the delta level this study found that the flood retention capacity of the vmd has been rapidly reduced due to dike construction previous studies such as dung et al 2018c and kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 found that a large amount of water storage on the floodplains especially in the lxq has already been lost due to dike construction the present study furthermore identified an increased flood damage due to extensive dike construction based on these findings we recommend careful conservation of the current floodwater retention capacity of the vmd floodplains to avoid any further rise in flood damage downstream as well as consequences such as reduced sediment load increased salinity intrusion and worsening riverbank erosion we propose that dike construction particularly construction of high dikes be ceased in floodplain areas where high dike construction is deemed necessary for protection of residents and built up areas the infrastructure should be designed to store at least the same amount of water as the floodwater naturally retained in that area so as to maintain flood regimes within the regions as well as in the surrounding areas our findings furthermore point to the advantages of an alternative dike agricultural system approach that is controlled flooding which uses low dikes and alternative farming systems a transition from the current high dike intensive production system to such low dike systems could increase agricultural revenues by reducing the need for substantial direct investment and minimizing unwanted externalities particularly flood damage salinity intrusion and sedimentation losses our analyses indicate that such a transition the ld2030 scenario could reduce economic losses considerably for flooding by 9 for salinity intrusion by 15 and for sediment reduction by 70 compared to the hd2030 scenario the total losses due to externalities are reduced significantly under the ld2030 scenario 0 478 109compared to 0 320 109 these indicative benefits from transforming land use and water management warrant initiation of experimentation and pilot projects at the farm and local levels to pave the way for a large scale transformation 5 3 limitations and ways forward this study faced several limitations the first regards the methodology used to assign monetary values to externalities to estimate the economic costs of downstream flooding we used estimates of floodwater depth and area flooded as simulated by a hydraulic model alongside available national data on economic losses though flood duration is considered a key indicator of flood damage in agriculture our hydraulic model simulations were unstable when running scenarios at long time intervals in addition the cost of riverbank erosion was estimated based on flood discharge dynamics provided by modeling yet the values derived by our study for the economic cost of large scale delta wide dike construction are subject to error due to data aggregation and price fluctuations over time we therefore recommend more detailed analyses and access to the recent data to improve estimates of dike construction and operation costs for example with better sampling of investment costs for different locations and different time periods using our multidimensional economic assessment method based on the literature and hydraulic modeling several cost and benefit components were quantified however this method raised some uncertainties as well the largest of these regards our calculations for the 2030 scenarios specifically these omitted annual interest and inflation rates from the yearly economic estimates of dike construction costs with an average value used instead in terms of cost and profit calculations for farm production actual figures could be very different from our findings if different areas of rice and vegetable production are realized moreover our calculations of the economic impacts of flood damage and salinity intrusion could be affected by the reliability of the economic loss data provided in national statistics in addition extensive dike construction is a factor in two of our externalities that is flood damage downstream and sedimentation losses therefore the cost of these externalities can be expected to be related to dike construction area finally though this study sought to derive the delta wide cost of dike agricultural system scenarios our method for scaling up from calculations per hectare to the whole vmd might mask interesting findings at the local level local level assessments could thus add valuable details to these analyses and further verify and strengthen our findings 6 conclusions this study presents a multidimensional assessment of two alternatives for land use and water management on the vmd delta scale costs and benefits were assed of 1 continuing the long established flood prevention approach by means of high dike construction and 2 transitioning to a controlled flooding system which uses low dikes and flood compatible agricultural systems the main conclusions are first large scale high dike development has indicated surpassed economic costs that are set to increasingly outstrip benefits over time this is mainly due to very high externalities a high initial investment cost and reduced revenue from the associated triple crop production system second a transition to a flood tolerant water management approach would benefit vmd sustainability both on the delta scale as presented in this study and at the farm level as presented in dung et al 2018a 2018b flood protection can be achieved by measures to increase the floodplains water retention capacity such a strategy has benefits for common pool resources while mitigating externalities however it requires a major shift from the current water management approach and the corresponding agricultural system in essence future delta management should refrain from high dike construction and pursue instead floodwater retention using low dikes and increased floodwater storage areas while developing flood resilient farming systems third the alternative delta management approach suggested here has important advantages over the existing approach including lower investment costs higher agricultural revenues and greater flood protection adapting the current delta management approach could therefore be highly promising for the long term safety and sustainability of the vmd this study can be construed as an initial attempt to assess the delta wide costs and benefits of alternative management approaches this is a complex topic requiring refined economic methods which can be improved upon in future work further research is needed to estimate costs and benefits of the given externalities using advanced hydraulic modeling agent based models with land use dynamics data together with more reliable and long term data about profits and costs of various crops finally our study indicates that there is a need for the national government to revise the current water management policies the construction of high dikes should be limited because in the long term the costs are probably higher than the benefits the study provides evidences for developing the delta by actively living with nature consulted by the mekong delta plan these policy implications do not only apply for the mekong delta but might also be valid for other deltas were investments in agricultural and water infrastructure often only consider short term benefits and ignore long term

10911,a dense dike system has been built in the upstream floodplains of the vietnamese mekong delta allowing large scale rice production based on compartmentalized fields and optimized water management intensive cultivation has enabled farmers to greatly increase their rice productivity and augment the national food bowl however flood control structures have undermined the water retention capacity compromising various benefits of floodwaters for delta ecosystems effects are both internal and external to farming negative internal effects are the large investment requirements and higher farming costs negative externalities include increased flood damage reduced sediment flows saltwater intrusion and riverbank erosion in this study we assessed the effects of three dike agricultural system scenarios on delta level sustainability considering both internal and external effects direct and indirect costs were estimated using various methodologies and the literature our findings show that extensive development of high dikes on the floodplains is the least economical and most ecologically risky alternative in this scenario accelerated high dike construction exacted a cost 136 greater than the situation represented by the baseline year of 2011 externalities in this scenario contributed to rising economic losses in both aquaculture and agriculture the scenario of transforming high dike into low dike systems revealed lower water management costs combined with lesser environmental impacts and greater capacity to exploit floodwater benefits our findings provide a useful input for decision makers considering the unintended economic consequences of existing water management strategies they support a transition to low dike farming systems for a more sustainable delta keywords rice production mekong sediment salinity intrusion flood risk sustainability 1 introduction in deltas worldwide downstream areas are influenced by human interventions upstream particularly where agricultural intensification is paired with extensive infrastructure for flood protection and water management large dams on the yangtze river for example have trapped natural sediment within reservoirs reducing sediment deposition downstream and causing riverbank erosion yang et al 2014 tessler et al 2017 estimated the effects of large dams on sediment fluxes for 46 deltas globally according to their calculations planned dams would reduce sediment fluxes in the danube by up to 60 and in the ganges brahmaputra meghna by some 21 in the danube hein et al 2016 reported on threats to ecosystem services arising from land use changes river regulation and dam construction over time for example increased flooding was observed in various regions of the catchment alongside increased pollution loads and loss of physical habitat diversity these outcomes have prompted governments to undertake restoration programs aiming to reconnect floodplains with their main rivers in order to increase nutrient and sediment retention and conserve floodplain ecosystems mcmillan and noe 2017 however the economic cost of such programs is high partly including cost of environmental degradation from the previous hardware programs guida et al 2016 upstream downstream problems are very evident on the vietnamese mekong delta vmd many studies have found increases in downstream flood damage salinity intrusion and riverbank erosion and reduced flows of fertile sediment this has been attributed to hydropower dam development upstream in the mekong river river diversion for irrigation land subsidence climate change and sea level rise hung 2012 hung et al 2014a manh et al 2014 2015 hoang et al 2016 dung et al 2018c these problems have been exacerbated by extensive construction of high dikes to enable triple rice production on the floodplains infrastructure such as the dense system of dikes and dams built since the 1990s alongside the growth of built up areas moreover restricts the space available for floodplain restoration on the vmd cosslett and cosslett 2014 environmental degradation is a real risk on the floodplains which before dike construction functioned as a natural water storage area mitigating flood damage and providing ecosystem services for a biologically productive and ecologically diverse region xuan and matsui 1998 to address the current problems and safeguard the delta effective water management strategies are needed a number of studies have assessed the impacts of upstream hydropower dam development river diversion for irrigation and climate change on vmd water regimes e g fredrik 2011 hung 2012 lauri et al 2012 lu et al 2014 manh et al 2014 richard and tran 2014 hoang et al 2016 while the upstream impacts have been relatively well covered the social and economic impacts of delta development processes remain poorly understood duong et al 2014 dang et al 2016 triet et al 2017 and dung et al 2018c looked at the implications of dike construction for floodwater regimes but they focused on hydraulic dynamics without considering social and economic influences some authors have considered the economic effects of dike construction but focused on specific locations see howie 2011 kien 2014 dan 2015 delta wide assessments have also been limited by lack of suitable methodologies and data constraints as a result externalities visible only at the delta level remain un quantified despite their acknowledged importance to our best knowledge no study has yet quantified the internal effects i e costs of dike construction and production systems and external effects e g increase in flood damage of extensive development of high dikes for triple rice production in the study region accelerated high dike construction for triple rice production has already widely impacted the vmd understanding the economic cost of dike related internalities and externalities is essential not only for formulating effective water management strategies but also for supporting decision makers in planning for a prosperous and sustainable delta as recommended in the mekong delta plan kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 this gap was filled by quantitatively assessing the internal and external effects of three dike agricultural system scenarios in a continuation of our previous work on the costs and benefits of flood protection and agricultural system alternatives at the farm level dung et al 2018a 2018b the current study assesses sustainability at the delta level our aim was to use cost benefit analysis to systematically quantify the internal and external impacts of several dike agricultural system scenarios for the vmd an economic methodology is used to test our hypothesis that the cost of high dike construction is greater than the benefits on the delta scale largely because development of such dikes reduces delta sustainability 2 study area the vmd spans 45 000 km2 of which some 39 400 km2 is in vietnam fig 1 located in the southernmost part of the river basin the vmd encompasses 13 provinces and major cities and is home to 18 million inhabitants the delta makes up 18 of the country s gdp mainly from fishery and agricultural production with an average per capita income of about us 2 217 in 2018 vna 2018 in our study the vmd was divided into two parts following the mekong delta plan the so called upstream delta floodplains and the downstream delta which includes the central and coastal zones the long xuyen quadrangle lxq and plain of reeds por are the vmd s two primary floodplains the world bank 2016 described these floodplains as natural sponges that regulate delta floodwaters by absorbing excess water in the flood season annually from july august to november december and releasing water back into the main streams in the dry season however as noted areas of double and triple rice production under low and high dike protection have greatly expanded across these floodplains in the last two decades this has halved the floodwater retention capacity of the lxq compared to 2000 dung et al 2018c both low dikes and high dikes are found on the floodplains low dikes hold back floodwaters long enough to allow production of two rice crops annually whereas high dikes block floodwaters completely allowing three three month rice crops per year dung and jacob 2017 large scale construction of high dikes however poses multiple risks to the delta in this study four such risks were considered all directly related to the floodplains reduced water retention capacity the first risk is downstream flooding dung et al 2018c triet et al 2017 the second is reduced flows of fertile sediment across the delta especially in the lxq due to the absence of dynamic interaction between rivers and floodplains during the flood season hung et al 2014a 2014b manh et al 2015 the third risk is salinity intrusion in the dry season though mainly caused by sea level rise and land subsidence salinity intrusion could be mitigated by the release of water retained within the floodplains smajgl et al 2015 hoang et al 2016 the fourth risk is riverbank erosion due to sudden increases in river flows such surges have been linked to reduced water retention capacity of the floodplains as well as to sediment retention by dams large scale sand mining in rivers and channels and land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction anthony et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 assessment of the costs and benefits of dike agricultural system scenarios an integrated assessment of dike agricultural system scenarios was conducted using cost benefit calculations and hydraulic modeling three scenarios were assessed the baseline representing the dike system in 2011 ed2011 full high dike development in 2030 hd2030 and full low dike development in 2030 ld2030 hd2030 can be considered the business as usual case as it assumes continued expansion of high dike agricultural systems particularly for intensive triple rice monoculture and vegetable production ld2030 represents an alternative development scheme characterized by a transition toward use of low dikes and floodwater friendly agriculture production particularly double rice production and floating crops e g floating rice lotus water mimosa and water lily hydraulic modeling was used to simulate dynamics of water levels and discharges as risks of downstream flood and potential river bank erosion of different dike agricultural system scenarios these risks were later evaluated by estimating the economic costs and benefits this model was developed based on the existing one dimensional 1 d hydraulic model with a quasi two dimensional 2 d approach using mike 11 software developed by the danish hydraulic institute the model used kinematic diffusive or fully dynamic vertically integrated equations for conservation of continuity and momentum the saint venant equations to solve complex ﬂow and mass transport problems dung et al 2018c the river network covers a domain of the whole mekong delta from kratie and the tonlé sap lake in cambodia to the river mouths in vietnam the model includes 5 million ha 4 084 river branches 13 000 cross sections and 21 235 computational nodes for the canal and water control infrastructure network sluice gates 14 weirs 2 246 and control structures 2 657 were identiﬁed representing the infrastructure system the model was calibrated and validated using observed flood hydrographs of 2011 and 2013 based on the discharge and water level time series from 15 gauging stations including 11 stations along the main rivers and 4 stations on the ﬂoodplains see dung et al 2018c for detailed description of input data parameters calibration and validation processes for each scenario 1 investment requirements and operational costs 2 production costs and revenues from agricultural systems and 3 externalities were calculated costs and benefits were derived from a literature review hydraulic modeling and field level empirical data calculations were done for 1 ha units then aggregated to the pan delta level using arc gis the sections below describe each step of the assessment 3 2 developing the scenarios the baseline scenario selected in this study represents the dike system of 2011 embedded with a historical extreme flood flood protection and water management are accomplished with a mix of low and high dikes the high dike triple rice production system is dominant in an giang province while the remaining of lxq and the por remains relatively open water with low dikes or no flood protection infrastructure the remaining two scenarios represent alternative futures for the vmd in terms of flood protection and water management and the corresponding agricultural production systems scenarios were based on three sources historic development trends 1990 2011 national and regional policy documents and development outlooks and the development strategy presented in the mekong delta plan see table a1 in the annex in essence hd2030 represents the current development trend that is gradual intensification and expansion of triple rice production by construction of high dikes for flood protection and water management under this scenario high dike construction spreads to the southwest and northeast thus the natural floodplains of the upper mekong delta are increasingly converted to agricultural lands especially for triple rice monoculture ld2030 considers an alternative that is a transformative change at the delta level in both flood risk management approach and in the intertwining agricultural production system there is a shift away from absolute flood prevention using high dikes preferred instead is controlled flooding which seeks to effectively and safely contain floodwaters within the system by increasing floodplain water retention capacity thereby reducing flood risk especially for downstream areas kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 in practical terms this latter option implies a backward transition from high dikes to low dikes and refraining from building new high dikes vmd agricultural systems would change as well instead of a triple rice monoculture double rice production would be combined with flood resilient crops during the flood season examples of these latter are lotus nelumbo nucifera and indigenous floating rice oryza prosative fig 2 visualizes the three scenarios 3 3 calculating investment and operational costs of scenarios the investment requirements for low and high dikes was derived from recent literature dan 2015 2015 dung et al 2018a kien 2014 operation and maintenance costs were referred from dan 2015 for each cost component cross study averages were calculated and these values were used for this study as the aim was to assess delta sustainability calculations of operation and maintenance costs were simplified by not taking into account annual discount rates for future scenarios as the area of annual dike construction could not be quantified given that the investment and operational costs were relatively homogeneous across the vmd floodplains a single cost estimate was applied for all locations in the delta see table a3 in the annex 3 4 calculating production costs and profit of agricultural systems the production costs and profit of agricultural systems were computed based on typical locations as surveyed by dung et al 2018a these served as proxies for the whole vmd in particular costs and profit were estimated for eight main agricultural systems in 117 sampled households at seven locations in an giang and dong thap provinces for the three years from 2014 to 2016 for each agricultural system production costs included fertilizer pesticides pumping costs and other this final category being mainly land preparation seed planting spraying harvesting and transport costs farm revenues were estimated using farmers reported crop yields and market prices again for the three years from 2014 to 2016 farm profit was then calculated as farm revenue minus production costs for double rice production costs and revenues averaged respectively in the range of us 1 537 1 713 and 3 070 4 088 for triple rice these figures were respectively 2 145 3 352 and 4 123 5 449 for vegetables costs and revenues were referenced from calculations for chili and sesame plus floating crops table a5 in the annex reports these for more detailed information on the calculation methods and results see dung et al 2018a 3 5 estimating externalities externalities of land use and water management systems are often abundant and multifaceted peng et al 2017 in this study the focus was on externalities already observed in the vmd or deemed highly likely in recent impact assessments in particular for each scenario the following externalities were considered changes in flood damage downstream changes in salinity intrusion in the coastal zone changes in suspended sediment carried by floodwaters and changes in riverbank erosion estimating direct monetary costs of externalities under the various scenarios was complicated by the fact that these externalities are not caused only by reduced floodwater retention capacity due to dike construction other factors are also at work such as hydropower development and climate change table a2 in the annex after quantifying the externalities based on data from our studies and the literature using simplified estimation methods the association between these externalities and floodplain water retention capacity were assessed fig 3 for this a proportional relationship was drawn between the dike construction area on the vmd floodplains and floodplain water retention capacity dung et al 2018c the methods used to quantify the externalities are presented below 3 5 1 flood risk complex computational methods are typically used for flood risk assessment winsemius et al 2013 these were simplified following wijayanti et al 2017 downstream flood risk was thus based on the spatial change in flooded area at various flood depths estimated under the three scenarios a geographic information system gis was used to interpolate the flooded area under each scenario with maximum water level data as simulated by a one dimensional quasi two dimensional 1d quasi2d hydraulic model for model setup and method see dung et al 2018b results were presented in both tabular and map form flood risk under the hd2030 and ld2030 scenarios was evaluated in relation to the baseline scenario ed2011 as such the impact of dike construction on the downstream flood risk was assessed by comparing the sizes of the downstream area flooded at different flood depths areas were defined as exposed to flood risk only if a flood depth greater than 1 m was registered because this is the depth at which aquaculture and flood based agriculture are disrupted balica et al 2014 economic costs of flooding were calculated using national statistics on losses in flooded areas in four years of extreme flooding 2000 2001 2002 and 2011 economic losses were then estimated from flooding for the hd2030 and ld2030 scenarios based on the percentage increase or decrease in flooded area compared to available data for the baseline year of 2011 3 5 2 salinity intrusion the vmd s two main rivers the tien and hau empty into the south china sea these rivers deliver large amounts floodwater to the floodplains via branches that can be diverted for irrigation and to flush away saltwater intrusion downstream in the dry season reduced flood retention capacity of the floodplains due to high dike construction could diminish this flushing capacity worsening salinity intrusion costs of salinity intrusion were estimated using rice yield reductions in a number of production areas affected in the extreme drought year of 2016 for the affected rice production area data were referenced from mard 2016 for yield reductions in rice which is a crop very sensitive to salinity nhan et al 2012 was used the economic losses were calculated by multiplying the economic loss for 1 ha by the affected rice production area ha the loss for 1 ha was computed by subtracting the net profit from 1 ha rice from the loss due to drought as provided by berg et al 2017 in their study in tien giang a coastal province of the vmd the reduction in rice yield is proportional to the salinity concentration see figure a1 in the annex the higher the salt concentration the lower yields will be in the vmd areas affected by salinity intrusion and salinity concentrations vary over the years salinity intrusion was mapped using contour lines provided by the southern institute for water resources research siwrr for the year 2008 and for 1998 2010 2015 and 2016 and the means for these years as provided by the southern institute for water resources planning siwrp the salinity data for 2008 were calibrated and verified by the siwrr using hydraulic modeling with an advection dispersion ad module while those of siwrp were drawn using observed data 3 5 3 sediment loss various studies have examined sediment loss on the floodplains as well as across the vmd for example hung et al 2014a measured fluvial sediment inside and outside dike compartments in dong thap province manh et al 2015 used hydraulic modeling to simulate sedimentation attributing reduced sediment load to hydropower dams and hydraulic works upstream dung et al 2018a found that fertilizer use had to be increased in rice farming systems under high dike protection compared to those in low dike areas to estimate the cost of reduced sedimentation was based on chapman et al 2016 these authors conducted a household survey interviewing 195 farmers in an giang province they computed the value of sediment using a set of components including the amount of fertilizer applied the average cost of fertilizer the cost efficiency gain per centimeter of sediment the average depth of sediment number of crops per year and area in production the annual value loss was then found by subtracting the annual value of sediment in low dike farming systems from that in high dike farming systems using the annual value loss economic losses due to reduced sediment load were calculated in our three scenarios by multiplying the average 1 ha sediment loss us year by the high dike area ha 3 5 4 riverbank erosion riverbank erosion is caused by human activities such as construction of upstream hydropower dams which change the flow of rivers and sand mining anthony et al 2015 riverbanks can also erode due to increased river discharges attributed to dike construction impacts of dike construction was quantified by analyzing changes in river discharge on the floodplains under the three scenarios for this the same 1d quasi2d hydraulic modeling simulations was used as applied in our flood risk estimates 4 results 4 1 internal cost and revenue of scenarios compared to our baseline ed2011 hd2030 with its greatly expanded high dike area has the greatest dike construction cost table 1 ld2030 with its low dikes presents the lowest cost specifically hd2030 implies a 136 greater investment and operational cost than ed2011 0 99 10 9 versus 0 42 109 investment and operational cost is much lower for the ld2030 scenario 0 05 109 for the high dikes in general investment and operational cost increases in proportion to the size of the high dike area regarding farm production hd2030 generates the lowest profit from both rice and vegetable production compared to ed2011 and ld2030 specifically the profit derived by converting all area to triple rice production as in hd2030 is us 0 81 10 9 profit from triple vegetable production is 3 54 10 9 both these estimates are lower than the profits calculated for ed2011 1 55 109 for rice and 4 33 109 for vegetables the profit from ld2030 is greater than that for hd2030 as 2 02 109 in profit can be gained from double rice production or 4 83 109 from double vegetable production combined with a floating crop the main reason why hd2030 returns such low profits lies in the increasing production costs of intensive farming systems over time e g due to rising need for fertilizer and pesticides leading to lower revenues compared to the other scenarios see also dung et al 2018a for rice production the total cost including dike construction investment and operational costs and farming inputs is highest for hd2030 4 34 10 9 compared to ed2011 2 50 109 and ld2030 1 32 109 the most costly agricultural system was vegetables if the entire area is developed with low dikes as in ld2030 10 38 109 compared to 7 95 10 9 and 1 32 10 9 however the total net profit is still highest for this full low dike scenario considering a double cropping cycle with vegetable production 4 75 109 remarkably the total net profit of hd2030 is lowest for production of both triple rice 0 97 109 and vegetables 1 76 109 compared to ed2011 respectively 0 8 109 and 3 57 109 and ld2030 1 93 109 and 4 75 109 4 2 externalities 4 2 1 flood risk results from the hydraulic modeling indicate greater risk of downstream flooding if high dikes are built on a large scale up to 2030 both area and depth of flooding increase under hd2030 but are generally reduced under ld2030 compared to ed2011 which represents the situation in 2011 fig 4 table 2 more specifically under hd2030 the area flooded to a depth of 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 m increases by respectively 8 3 and 8 compared to ed2011 in contrast under ld2030 the area flooded to a depth of 1 2 m increases by 5 but it decreases by 14 at the depths greater than 2 m compared to ed2011 regarding economic losses due to flooding under ed2011 losses due to flooding are 0 194 109 these increase by 19 to 0 231 109 under the full high dike development scenario hd2030 under ld2030 representing full implementation of low dikes economic losses are reduced by 9 to 0 177 109 compared to the baseline fig 5 4 2 2 salinity intrusion economic losses due to salinity intrusion were estimated by its direct impact in reducing rice yields for the area affected table 3 fig 6 maps areas affected by salinity intrusion the baseline scenario ed2011 presents a loss of 0 148 109 the loss under hd2030 is 10 higher due to increased salinity intrusion caused by reduced floodwater retention capacity of the floodplains 0 163 109 under ld2030 losses due to salinity intrusion are 10 less than in the baseline scenario that is 0 133 109 compared to 0 148 109 4 2 3 sediment loss diminished sediment load results in a potential economic loss of about us 110 for each hectare of agricultural land under high dike protection table 4 compared to the baseline scenario of ed2011 the economic loss due to reduced sedimentation increases by 155 under hd2030 from 0 033 109 to 0 084 109 under ld2030 the low dike scenario this loss is reduced by 70 from 0 033 109 to 0 010 109 4 2 4 riverbank and dike erosion compared to ed2011 the average discharge of delta rivers changes under hd2030 and ld2030 fig 7 hd2030 presents the greatest increase in river discharge whereas river discharge decreases under ld2030 the flood retention capacity of the floodplains is reduced under hd2030 raising floodwater discharge on the por and most of the lxq in the tien and hau rivers discharge increases by 0 1 0 6 rising also by 0 1 64 in the rivers along the boundaries of the lxq and por floodplains in some lxq rivers increases in flood discharge are caused by changes in floodwater distribution due to dike construction in contrast under ld2030 flood discharge decreases in most rivers thanks to the restoration of the water retention capacity of the floodplains here discharges of the main rivers decrease by 1 27 in the rivers along the lxq boundaries flood discharges increase by 2 326 due to greater floodwater volumes from the floodplains being released into the gulf of thailand 5 discussion a systematic cost benefit analysis of three vmd dike agricultural system scenarios was implemented demonstrating significant and differentiated hydrological and economic impacts for each while considerable recent literature has been dedicated to assessing and to some extent quantifying costs and benefits of land use and water management interventions our aim was to contribute a missing piece of the puzzle that is we sought to bring the delta wide and multidimensional implications of interventions into focus this section discusses our main findings and their implications for long term delta management and sustainability it then reflects on some limitations of the current study and recommendations for future research 5 1 main findings first results show that a land and water management strategy geared predominantly to flood prevention as represented by the hd2030 scenario is not economically and hydrologically feasible for the vmd in the long run our study found large scale high dike construction to be a costly option with dubious benefits in the long run upgrading the current situation to a full high dike system was found to be 136 more costly than the baseline 2011 dike system us 0 99 109 versus 0 42 109 this is equivalent to 11 of the agricultural earnings from the whole vmd region in 2010 siwrp 2012 in terms of farm production hd2030 returns the lowest profit and sometimes even resulted in losses for both rice and vegetables due to increasing production costs over time in addition to the considerable initial investment required for dike construction externalities are also prominent in the hd2030 scenario with the potential to cause economic losses of 0 478 109 equivalent to 50 to 25 the net profit gained from intensified rice to vegetable production see tables 1 and 5 other externalities that exact a high price under this scenario are the higher flood damage downstream and the reduction of natural sedimentation of the floodplains all in all these findings suggest a need to reconsider plans to expand high dike development in the future second sediment load was the externality most affected in our scenarios though with the smallest impact in absolute terms compared to the other externalities considered i e downstream flood damage salinity intrusion and riverbank erosion multiple studies have found that hydropower development upstream on the mekong river and expansion of high dike agricultural systems have led to reduced sediment in delta floodwaters kummu and varis 2007 hung 2012 hung et al 2014b manh et al 2014 2015 diminished inflows of fertile sediment with annual floodwaters reduces crop yields and productivity which represents a substantial economic loss for the delta extensive construction of high dikes for intensive crop production thus seems certain to diminish farm incomes and the delta economy lastly our study found a close relationship between the reduced flood retention capacity of the vmd floodplains and large scale high dike construction for rice production though floodplain water retention capacity is key to mitigate flood damage downstream and to reduce other unwanted externalities such as losses of sedimentation and mounting salinity intrusion there is an increasing trend toward high dike construction to enable triple rice production on the vmd floodplains mard 2015 in recent decades various countries have recognized floodwater control infrastructures as being at odds with sustainable development goals for economic social and environmental reasons multiple projects have been initiated to restore floodplains by replacing the concrete infrastructures built in years past with more environmentally appropriate systems vis et al 2003 temmerman et al 2013 van staveren et al 2014 roth and winnubst 2014 this again suggests that in vietnam construction of high dikes should be reconsidered in light of the current findings particularly the high long term costs demonstrated in the present study 5 2 implications for sustainable vmd management findings from this study are relevant for sustainable land and water management in the vmd in several ways at the farm level our calculated costs of salinity intrusion and sediment reduction see table 5 reveal the direct financial consequences of high dike development for rice production these externalities which result in increasing production costs over time suggest that intensive rice production on the vmd floodplains under high dike protection is financially unfeasible and unsustainable in the long run indeed farmers will likely need to increasingly use fertilizers to compensate for reduced sedimentation while salinization too will likely increasingly affect rice yields future planning and development of rice production systems would do well to consider such costs to ensure the longer term sustainability of farm earnings and delta livelihoods at the delta level this study found that the flood retention capacity of the vmd has been rapidly reduced due to dike construction previous studies such as dung et al 2018c and kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 found that a large amount of water storage on the floodplains especially in the lxq has already been lost due to dike construction the present study furthermore identified an increased flood damage due to extensive dike construction based on these findings we recommend careful conservation of the current floodwater retention capacity of the vmd floodplains to avoid any further rise in flood damage downstream as well as consequences such as reduced sediment load increased salinity intrusion and worsening riverbank erosion we propose that dike construction particularly construction of high dikes be ceased in floodplain areas where high dike construction is deemed necessary for protection of residents and built up areas the infrastructure should be designed to store at least the same amount of water as the floodwater naturally retained in that area so as to maintain flood regimes within the regions as well as in the surrounding areas our findings furthermore point to the advantages of an alternative dike agricultural system approach that is controlled flooding which uses low dikes and alternative farming systems a transition from the current high dike intensive production system to such low dike systems could increase agricultural revenues by reducing the need for substantial direct investment and minimizing unwanted externalities particularly flood damage salinity intrusion and sedimentation losses our analyses indicate that such a transition the ld2030 scenario could reduce economic losses considerably for flooding by 9 for salinity intrusion by 15 and for sediment reduction by 70 compared to the hd2030 scenario the total losses due to externalities are reduced significantly under the ld2030 scenario 0 478 109compared to 0 320 109 these indicative benefits from transforming land use and water management warrant initiation of experimentation and pilot projects at the farm and local levels to pave the way for a large scale transformation 5 3 limitations and ways forward this study faced several limitations the first regards the methodology used to assign monetary values to externalities to estimate the economic costs of downstream flooding we used estimates of floodwater depth and area flooded as simulated by a hydraulic model alongside available national data on economic losses though flood duration is considered a key indicator of flood damage in agriculture our hydraulic model simulations were unstable when running scenarios at long time intervals in addition the cost of riverbank erosion was estimated based on flood discharge dynamics provided by modeling yet the values derived by our study for the economic cost of large scale delta wide dike construction are subject to error due to data aggregation and price fluctuations over time we therefore recommend more detailed analyses and access to the recent data to improve estimates of dike construction and operation costs for example with better sampling of investment costs for different locations and different time periods using our multidimensional economic assessment method based on the literature and hydraulic modeling several cost and benefit components were quantified however this method raised some uncertainties as well the largest of these regards our calculations for the 2030 scenarios specifically these omitted annual interest and inflation rates from the yearly economic estimates of dike construction costs with an average value used instead in terms of cost and profit calculations for farm production actual figures could be very different from our findings if different areas of rice and vegetable production are realized moreover our calculations of the economic impacts of flood damage and salinity intrusion could be affected by the reliability of the economic loss data provided in national statistics in addition extensive dike construction is a factor in two of our externalities that is flood damage downstream and sedimentation losses therefore the cost of these externalities can be expected to be related to dike construction area finally though this study sought to derive the delta wide cost of dike agricultural system scenarios our method for scaling up from calculations per hectare to the whole vmd might mask interesting findings at the local level local level assessments could thus add valuable details to these analyses and further verify and strengthen our findings 6 conclusions this study presents a multidimensional assessment of two alternatives for land use and water management on the vmd delta scale costs and benefits were assed of 1 continuing the long established flood prevention approach by means of high dike construction and 2 transitioning to a controlled flooding system which uses low dikes and flood compatible agricultural systems the main conclusions are first large scale high dike development has indicated surpassed economic costs that are set to increasingly outstrip benefits over time this is mainly due to very high externalities a high initial investment cost and reduced revenue from the associated triple crop production system second a transition to a flood tolerant water management approach would benefit vmd sustainability both on the delta scale as presented in this study and at the farm level as presented in dung et al 2018a 2018b flood protection can be achieved by measures to increase the floodplains water retention capacity such a strategy has benefits for common pool resources while mitigating externalities however it requires a major shift from the current water management approach and the corresponding agricultural system in essence future delta management should refrain from high dike construction and pursue instead floodwater retention using low dikes and increased floodwater storage areas while developing flood resilient farming systems third the alternative delta management approach suggested here has important advantages over the existing approach including lower investment costs higher agricultural revenues and greater flood protection adapting the current delta management approach could therefore be highly promising for the long term safety and sustainability of the vmd this study can be construed as an initial attempt to assess the delta wide costs and benefits of alternative management approaches this is a complex topic requiring refined economic methods which can be improved upon in future work further research is needed to estimate costs and benefits of the given externalities using advanced hydraulic modeling agent based models with land use dynamics data together with more reliable and long term data about profits and costs of various crops finally our study indicates that there is a need for the national government to revise the current water management policies the construction of high dikes should be limited because in the long term the costs are probably higher than the benefits the study provides evidences for developing the delta by actively living with nature consulted by the mekong delta plan these policy implications do not only apply for the mekong delta but might also be valid for other deltas were investments in agricultural and water infrastructure often only consider short term benefits and ignore long term

10912,water managers in arid and semi arid areas must allocate limited irrigation water to different water use sectors considering the conflicting objectives seasonal runoff inflow and multiple uncertainties to deal with these problems an interval multiobjective multi stage stochastic programming immsp model was proposed for finding reasonable water storage scale and optimizing limited irrigation water resources key factors in planning irrigation water resources such as random seasonal runoff interval uncertainty in data collection economic benefits water leakage loss and water deficit were fully considered in the immsp model additionally as an important indicator to describe the seasonal water supply capability of local water supply project including reservoirs agricultural ponds and etc the water storage scale defined as the ratio of water storage capacity over total streamflow is proposed to obtain the quantitative relationship between this indicator and objective of immsp this study attempted to obtain the relationship between water storage scale and objective of immsp as well as provide a reference of determining water storage scale from the perspective of optimization in addition to solve the immsp model a modified minimum deviation mmd method was proposed for dealing with uncertainties making tradeoff among conflicting objectives and reflecting the different importance of objectives both the immsp model and mmd method were applied to a real world water allocation problem in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin for verifying its validity the solutions generate a set of decision alternatives under different seasonal runoff scenarios and further guide local water managers identify the optimal management strategies and project construction scale of water conservancy moreover a sound discussion of contribution to water storage scale planning is made and the comparisons between immsp and each single objective model economic benefits water leakage loss and water deficit in this study demonstrate that the results obtained by the proposed approach are more practical than a single objective with the same constraints these results can not only effectively contribute to local irrigation water management and ecological restoration but also provide more information to plan regional water storage scale values keywords water storage scale irrigation water allocation interval multiobjective programming interval multi stage stochastic programming 1 introduction water shortage crises caused by seasonal runoff inflow are occurring in arid and semi arid regions all around the world chen et al 2017 as water becomes increasingly scarce the fierce contradiction between the increase of water demand and limited water availability spark potential conflict among water users which calls for higher water use efficiency wue for agricultural production fu et al 2018 kang et al 2009 especially for arid and semi arid regions the significant difference of available irrigation water exists among different seasons which intensify the spatiotemporal asymmetry between irrigation water supply and demand and further cause more difficulties in regional policies making thus more effort should be made to fully use seasonal available water and improve agricultural wue li et al 2017a b as one of the significant tool to deal with the practical problems the mathematical model is widely used in addressing water shortage problems and obtaining optimal allocation schemes in the process of trying to solve specific problems series of optimization models have been developed such as single objective programming models multiobjective models two stage stochastic programming models and multistage programming models guo et al 2018 li et al 2010 guo et al 2009 with the gradual advancement of related research various uncertainties such as grey numbers fuzziness and randomness were fully considered when establishing optimization models to make full use of collected data and accurately describe practical problems li et al 2017a b kong et al 2017 liu et al 2017 these efforts successfully improve the practicality of the results of optimization model among optimization models interval multi stage stochastic programming imsp models show good performance in dealing with both seasonally available water featured as randomness and interval uncertainty caused by data collection chen et al 2017 in reality to obtain satisfied water allocation schemes more indicators have to be considered by water managers besides simply considering economic factors in the process of optimizing limited irrigation water for example crop quality guarantee irrigation water savings and water leakage loss are some real concerns of water managers and need to be taken into account to improve the practicality of the allocation schemes guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 when simultaneously considering these indicators in irrigation water management water managers may have to make tradeoff among multiple conflicting objectives however the imsp can hardly address conflicting objectives in practical allocation problems and related researches can be hardly found to tackle multiobjective problems in imsp framework so far thus this study attempts to develop an interval multiobjective multi stage stochastic programming immsp model based on imsp to simultaneously tackle multiple objectives seasonal streamflow and uncertainties for guiding regional water policies formulation when using immsp for optimizing limited irrigation water allocation the amounts of seasonally available water is the basis of the allocation zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 which would be directly affected by the condition of local water conservancy projects gaupp et al 2015 zhang 2009 water conservancy projects including reservoirs agricultural ponds and etc are built to ease the contradiction between water demand and water supply among seasons and play more and more important roles in agricultural production therefore the storage capacity designing of water conservancy projects is another planning problem faced by water managers beyond planning limited irrigation water planning storage capacity of water conservancy projects is a complex work that should take many aspects into consideration such as cost environmental impacts historical hydrology and agricultural development level sahin et al 2016 actually besides these factors decision makers need to know how it would influence the optimization allocation schemes which call for an indicator to reflect the storage capacity of water conservancy projects in the optimization model many indicators such as seasonal variability inter annual variability and upstream storage were introduced into water management to reflect the specific aspects when developing optimization models gassert et al 2015 but none of them can reflect the seasonal water storage capability of water conservancy projects thus a novel indicator water storage scale is proposed to measure the water storage capability of water conservancy projects during a season in this study the water storage scale is defined as the ratio of water storage capacity over total streamflow a higher regional water storage scale means a larger water storage capacity of water conservancy projects and thus brings higher flexibility in agricultural water management among seasons thus this study attempts to introduce the water storage scale into immsp model to obtain the quantitative relationship between this indicator and objective of immsp and further provide a reference of determining water storage scale from the perspective of optimization the water storage scale is regarded as a variable parameter in process of planning irrigation water allocation to observe how it affect the main indicators in planning which would give decision makers more information when planning regional water storage scale because immsp is a new model proposed to deal with practical problems a novel solving method need to be formulated based on existed methods for solving multiobjective problems many efforts have been made to obtain satisfied solutions via making tradeoffs among different objectives zhang et al 2018b ren et al 2019 for instance some bionic algorithms including genetic algorithm ant colony algorithm particle swarm algorithm and etc have shown the effectiveness in dealing with multiobjective programming models and obtain the pareto solution of the multiobjective programming models doerner et al 2004 yousefi et al 2018 guo et al 2018 but the complex program and frame structure influence the solving efficiency of bionic algorithms when requested to deal with uncertainties such as interval numbers in multiobjective bionic algorithms would face more difficulties due to its complexity the interval number is the number represented by the interval which is actually a set of all real numbers on a closed interval therefore some mathematical methods with the simple structure such as fuzzy coordination method efficacy coefficient method linear weighting method and minimum deviation method were proposed to solve multiobjective problems zhang et al 2019 wang and qiu 2013 lachhwani 2012 zhao et al 2017 the core ideology of these methods is to transform the multiobjective model into a single objective model via different methods which effectively simplify the solving process however some limitation existed in these methods when solving multiobjective programming for example the fuzzy coordination method efficacy coefficient method and minimum deviation method can hardly reflect the different importance of different objectives linear weighting method would face difficulty when dealing with multiple uncertainties thereupon the modified minimum deviation mmd method an integrated solving method coupling some key thinking of efficacy coefficient method linear weighting method and the minimum deviation method is proposed in this study mmd was formulated through borrowing the interval number processing method from efficacy coefficient method the way to deal with different importance of objectives from the linear weighting method and the tradeoff method among multiple objectives from the typical minimum deviation method these efforts allow mmd to tackle effectively the interval numbers and well reflect the different importance of objectives in multiobjective problems in this study mmd method is used for solving immsp model and identifying the optimal management strategies this study attempts to propose a new model immsp and corresponding solving method mmd to deal with the multiple complicities for optimizing irrigation water allocation besides water storage scale is considered in immsp to obtain the relationship between water storage scale and objective of immsp the immsp model makes the first attempt of coupling imsp and multiobjective programming in one framework which can 1 make the tradeoff among multiple conflicting objectives 2 deal with multiple uncertainties existed in optimization such as interval and stochastic 3 reflect the influence of the seasonal streamflow 4 provide a reference of determining water storage scale from the perspective of optimization additionally mmd method is a novel solving method developed for addressing interval multiobjective problems with reflecting the different importance of objectives then both the immsp model and mmd method were applied to a real world water allocation problem in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin a typical arid region in northwest china for verifying its validity the solutions will generate a set of decision alternatives under different seasonal runoff scenarios and further guide local water managers identify the optimal management strategies and project construction scale of water conservancy 2 methodology the technical framework of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 1 as demonstrated by this figure the methodology consists of three major components the imsp optimization model the immsp optimization and the modified minimum deviation method for solving the immsp model firstly the msp and ilp are integrated as imsp to deal with the randomness of seasonal runoff local policy target imprecise collected data and dynamics in water allocation based on imsp the immsp model is developed to address three conflicting objectives simultaneously then the interval numbers in immsp were replaced as deterministic numbers by their average value and then the objective value of three single objective models which come from the objectives of immsp were calculated under each water storage scale α through calculating the minimum deviation from the best objective value the minimum deviation md results of multiobjective multistage stochastic programming mmsp model with deterministic parameters under each α level can be obtained by the typical minimum deviation method thus the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of immsp model can be obtained finally the mmd method is used to solve immsp these will be described below in detail 2 1 interval multistage stochastic programming imsp in arid and semi arid regions the practical problem faced by agricultural water managers is allocating limited irrigation water to multiple users over a multi period planning horizon however water allocation among different stages such as different seasons and different crop growth stages is a complicated dynamic process because the water inflow and water demand of each stage are uncertain chen et al 2017 such a problem can be formulated as a multistage stochastic programming msp model which can deal with these complicated dynamic problems by taking corrective measures in subsequent periods after a random event has taken place li and huang 2007 a multistage scenario tree for allocating limited irrigation water to n irrigation districts among three seasons spring summer and autumn is shown in fig 2 to denote dynamic features in the associated stages there are four stages in the allocation period and stage 1 is the beginning of the water allocation water managers should plan the whole year water allocation in stage 1 before period 1 spring arrives seasonal random runoff inflow is divided into high flow level h medium flow level m and low flow level l to describe possible runoff inflow in each season therefore there are 33 kinds of possible scenarios during the whole crop growth period which creates 33 water allocation schemes in stage 1 due to the difficulty of collecting precise data for many practical problems some of the parameters collected for model inputs can be expressed as interval numbers therefore interval linear programming is integrated in the msp model resulting in interval multistage stochastic programming imsp zhang et al 2017 the typical imsp model for irrigation water allocation can be expressed as follows and parameters used are clarified in appendix i 1a max f i 1 i t 1 t b i t w d i t i 1 i t 1 t k 1 k t p t k c i t s i t k subject to 1b i 1 i w

variables are determined before the realizations of random variables are disclosed i e w d i t and recourse variables after the realized random event has occurred i e s i t k 2 2 interval multistage multiobjective stochastic programming immsp the imsp model can effectively solve the problem of allocating limited irrigation water to users among multiple periods considering the interval uncertainties that exist in the process of data collection however the typical imsp always focuses on achieving the single objective and it is unable to take multiple objectives into consideration simultaneously thus the interval multiobjective programming imp model can be used to make up for this deficiency of imsp a typical imp model can be written as follows 2a max f x j max f 1 x j f 2 x j f n x j subject to 2b j 1 j a x j b 2c c j x j d j 2d x j 0 where n is the number of the nonlinear objectives and j is the number of variables x j is a vector of interval decision variables f n x i are objectives a j b j c j and d j are the interval coefficients of constraints by integrating the imsp and imp model in a general framework an interval multistage multiobjective stochastic programming immsp model for optimizing irrigation water could be formulated as follows besides water storage scale is considered in constraint 3e and parameters used are clarified in table 1 objective

deviation method for solving immsp in order to solve multiobjective programming problems many approaches have been used to obtain satisfactory solutions such as the minimum deviation md method evolutionary algorithm method fuzzy goal programming method and efficiency coefficient method zhang et al 2018a 2019 wang and qiu 2013 lachhwani 2012 zhao et al 2017 although these methods can effectively address specific multiobjective problems such as linear multiobjective programming and interval multiobjective programming none of them can solve the newly developed immsp model in an effective and concise way because of the multiple uncertainties existence in immsp therefore a modified minimum deviation mmd method is proposed in this study as a potential tool to solve the immsp model the mmd method integrates the approach to dealing with interval numbers in the efficiency coefficient method and typical md method to solve immsp the main idea of the typical md method is to transform the multiobjective programming into single objective programming via making the tradeoff between the best and worst value of each objective the specific solution steps of the mmd method for solving immsp are denoted as follows step 1 convert every interval set x of the immsp model using the equation x x r δ x where δ x x x and r 0 1 thereby the immsp model was transformed to a typical multiobjective model which can be solved by the md method step 2 calculate the best and worst value of each objective f 1 max f 1 min f 2 max f 2 min f 3 max f 3 min step 3 to achieve the tradeoff between the best and worst value of each objective a single objective model can be obtained with the help of the results in step 2 based on md method besides each objective is given a weight to show its importance the corresponding objective of model 3 is 4 min f ω 1 f 1 max f 1 f 1 max f 1 min ω 2 f 2 f 2 min f 2 max f 2 min ω 3 f 3 f 3 min f 3 max f 3 min where f is the total weighted deviation of three objectives ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 are the weights of each objective given by water managers which can be obtained by the analytic hierarchy process ahp method f 1 f 2 f 3 are the objectives in model 3 the constraints of this reformulated model are the same as model 3 step 4 after replacing the objectives in model 3 by eqs 4 the immsp model can be transformed as an interval single objective model then the typical two step interactive algorithm for solving interval programming is used to solve the above problem by decomposing the model into two sub models in two step interactive algorithm the solution corresponding to f lower bound sub model should be firstly solved and the relevant solution corresponding to f upper bound sub model is feasible as one of the two bounds of the interval number the lower bound submodel and upper bound submodel can be formulated as follows lower bound submodel 5a min f m 1 k 1 c m x m m k 1 1 m c m x m subject to 5b m 1 k 1 a m p s i g n a m p x m m k 1 1 m a m p s i g n a m p x m b j 5c x m x m 0 where x m m 1 2 k 1 and x m m k 1 1 k 1 2 m are the decision variables with negative and positive coefficients in the objective functions c m are the coefficients of decision variables s i g n a m p 1 i f a m p 0 1 i f a m p 0 after solving lower bound submodel the optimal solutions x m o p t m 1 2 k 1 and x m o p t m k 1 1 k 1 2 m can be obtained upper bound submodel 6a min f m 1 k 1 c m x m m k 1 1 m c m x m subject to 6b m 1 k 1 a m p s i g n a m p x m m k 1 1 m a m p s i g n a m p x m b j 6c 0 x m x m o p t m k 1 1 k 1 2 m 6d x m x m o p t m 1 2 k 1 step 5 the interval solution can be obtained by integrating the solutions of two sub models and final solution of the immsp model would be generated 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area is in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin 97 37 102 06 e 37 44 42 40 n gansu province northwest china with an arid climate and limited rainfall it includes three administrative regions including ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county as shown in fig 3 the middle reaches can be divided into seventeen irrigation districts ids and the water consumption in the middle reaches accounts for over 80 of the whole heihe river basin due to high evapotranspiration and little precipitation irrigation is of great significance for agricultural production in the middle reaches with the rapid development of agriculture in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin where agriculture irrigation occupies approximately 90 of the total water consumption li et al 2015 the conflict between increased irrigation water demand and limited irrigation water is intensified as a way to relieve conflicts more groundwater has been exploited to guarantee agricultural production thus groundwater level decline and ecosystem destruction occur in the middle reaches in addition with less surface water flow into the lower reaches desertification in downstream basins gradually becomes more serious which makes the lower reaches of the heihe a major sandstorm place of origin in china hence managers have realized that it is necessary to limit the water use in the middle reaches especially agricultural water consumption this will result in more intense competition among water users because of fewer available irrigation water resources therefore how to optimally allocate limited irrigation water resources under seasonal stream flow and thus improve agricultural water use efficiency have become growing urgent issues for sustainable agriculture zhang and guo 2017 for arid and semi arid regions like middle reaches of heihe river basin the formulation of water allocation schemes should take more indicators into account besides economic benefit for example although the leakage loss occurred in the water delivery process contributes to groundwater restoration the exploitation of these groundwater consume more energy and labor which increase the cost and environmental pollution thus decreasing the leakage loss in irrigation is considered by water managers when forming irrigation water allocation policy the practical allocation problems become more complex touching upon uncertainties and multiple objectives in existing agricultural systems the first problem faced by local water managers is to plan a suitable water storage scale to guarantee adequate and stable irrigation water among seasons thus water managers have to obtain the relationship how water storage scale influence the allocation objectives which will provide a new perspective to determine the proper water storage scale for this region 3 2 parameter determination to obtain the optimal allocation schemes from the immsp model many input parameters are necessary including socioeconomic data among different irrigation districts ids information about irrigation water allocation targets and water availabilities of each season the streamflow in this study is the total runoff flow of each season obtained from the yingluo gorge hydrological station the yingluo gorge is the boundary between upstream and middle reaches table 2 presents the total available irrigation water and its probabilities during a whole crop growth period in different stages the available surface water is divided into three discrete intervals associated with probability distributions to obtain the inflows a pearson type iii distribution was used in this study to obtain the distribution of surface water inflow with the help of statistical data from the annual runoff of the yingluoxia hydrological station during 1945 to 2013 then the category of three inflow levels can be calculated based on frequency analysis li et al 2016 table 3 shows the irrigation water target demand and effective rainfall in different ids of each season the water allocation targets and minimum water demand of different ids in each season were estimated based on statistical the historical data besides the effective rainfall is obtained from the multi year average effective rainfall table 4 provides related socioeconomic statistical data for the study area these data were collected from historical data survey data and the statistical yearbook of zhangye city for the years 2002 2016 the actual water storage scale is 0 146 which can be calculated from gansu water resources bulletin furthermore as key parameters to solving immsp via mmd the weights of each objective ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 were calculated by ahp method through making pairwise contrast among three objectives by regional water managers according to the practical conditions a pairwise comparison judgment matrix can be established easily zhang et al 2018a and further the importance weight of each objective can be obtained the pairwise comparison and calculated weights is shown in table 5 according to the ahp theory the consistency ratio is acceptable if it does not exceed 0 10 which shows that the judgment matrix is consistent table 5 shows that the obtained importance weights are acceptable in this study 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 optimization of water resources using the methodology and basic data the immsp model can be solved optimal allocation results of irrigation water resources were obtained as fig 4 there are 33 allocation scenarios according to the scenario tree in fig 2 the allocation results change with dynamic seasonal flow levels and provide a specific irrigation water allocation scheme for local water managers fig 4 shows the status quo 2015 water allocation scheme and the total water and groundwater allocation results under all 27 possible scenarios hhh hhm hhl hmh hmm hml hlh hlm hll mhh mhm mhl mmh mmm mml mlh mlm mll lhh lhm lhl lmh lmm lml llh llm lll h m l indicate high medium low flow level respectively among seventeen irrigation districts in three seasons spring summer autumn which provide water managers a range of allocation strategies in response to the uncertainties existing in the decision making process when water deficit occurs the smaller irrigation areas are more susceptible to negative effects according to the optimization results that is optimization results obtained from immsp model tend to allocate limited water to the ids with higher wue and iw and further help agricultural water managers rank the allocation order among ids and find the water allocation threshold moreover it can be found that surface water is preferentially used for irrigation in most of irrigation districts which may contribute to local groundwater level recovery and ecological restoration for giving water managers more intuitive reference toward the optimization schemes some important indicators that water managers concerned were calculated based on the optimization results fig 5 a shows the total water allocation under each scenario it can be found that the irrigation water allocated in summer occupy the largest water consume around a year that is summer is the most important season and the available irrigation water in summer have obviously influence on agricultural production in addition three objectives of immsp under each scenario were calculated and shown in fig 5 b fig 5 c and fig 5 d respectively the economic benefit and possible irrigation water leakage loss has the positive correlation relationship with the total water allocation which can be easily understood that more available water could bring higher irrigation water leakage loss during water allocation and higher economic benefit to measure the efficiency of water use two indicators economic benefit per unit water bpuw and water use efficiency wue were calculated and shown in fig 5 bpuw and wue are respectively defined as the ratio of economic benefit over total irrigation water used and the ratio of the effective water that can be used by the crop over total irrigation water used these two indicators and irrigation water deficit fig 5 b reflect the opposite trend with other indicators among different scenarios according to the optimization results if water deficit occurred in agricultural production the total possible economic benefit would decrease while the use efficiency of limited water would be improved this reminds water managers that although both economic benefit and efficiency are what they want the contradiction between these two factors has to be considered when planning local water policies these results obtained by immsp can provide local water managers possible values of benefits water loss and water deficit under corresponding water allocation schemes water managers can choose suitable irrigation water allocation schemes according to the actual runoff information from table 1 moreover useful suggestions could be proposed to improve local wue such as construction of water storage and canal seepage prevention projects in summary seasonal runoff inflow has significant impacts on the economic benefit irrigation water leakage loss and efficiency of water use as the seasonal runoff inflow plays such an important role in agricultural production water storage scale an indicator that have a direct influence on available water in each season need to be planned for making full use of limited irrigation water among seasons 4 2 contribution to water storage scale planning the water storage scale α is an important parameter for determining regional available water and the basis of solving the immsp model the relationship between α and objectives including three single objective and multiobjective can be obtained and provide more information for water managers when determining proper water storage scale following the calculation process shown in the study framework fig 1 the objective results of these models under different α levels and the quantified relationship between α and the objective of immsp can be obtained as fig 6 shows with the increase of α level it can be found that economic benefit fig 6 a was improved that is the higher water storage capacity can contribute to the economic benefit in the study area conversely leakage loss fig 6 b and weighted water shortage fig 6 c go down with increasing water storage capacity which indicates that larger water storage capacity could not only help save more irrigation water from leakage loss but also decrease the irrigation water deficit besides it is noteworthy that these two indicators become steady when α is greater than 0 2 and the rate of all model growth is slower with increasing α values the minimum deviation fig 6 d can be obtained via md method and the functional relationship between water storage scale and minimum deviation is y 0 3939 x 2 0 3177 x 0 1663 with a high deterministic coefficient zhang et al 2019 0 9941 it can be found that larger water storage capacity can likely help obtain better water allocation schemes however when determining suitable water storage scale more meaningful factors including the construction cost and environmental influence of water storage project need to be considered the functional relationship obtained in this study can give water managers one more support beside typical factors to plan a reasonable water storage capacity scale α according to the field survey the actual water storage scale of study area is around 0 146 but the construction of local water storage project is continuously going on thus these information can help local water managers understand how the water storage scale will affect the agricultural production under future possible scenario 4 3 discussion this study aims to develop an integrated model immsp for irrigation water allocation three contradictory goals i e system economic benefit irrigation water leakage loss and water deficit were considered simultaneously in the immsp to prove the effectiveness of the immsp model in combining the three objectives the target value comparison between the immsp model and each single objective model was made in table 6 as shown in table 6 the single objective model can obtain the best value of that objective but cannot consider other important aspects on the contrary the immsp model can effectively consider tradeoffs among the three objectives including maximizing system net benefit objective 1 minimizing total leakage loss objective 2 and minimizing water deficit objective 3 by obtaining the best coordinated satisfaction of these objectives the targets calculated by the developed model are close to the optimization value of the single objective models which indicates that the developed immsp model can make tradeoff among three different objective functions immsp can simultaneously address the seasonal streamflow multi stage decision making process and multiple objectives under uncertainty in one framework which can simplify the optimization process and better reflect the practical problem faced by water managers in managing limited irrigation water resources additionally the relationship between the water storage scale and objective of the immsp model can be obtained for guiding local decision makers to plan future water conservancy project construction immsp give water managers a new reference for planning the regional water storage scale from the perspective of optimization to make full use of seasonal streamflow and further improve wue in this study all in all the immsp model can not only provide the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of the optimization model for local water managers but also obtain optimized water allocation schemes via coordinating the three objectives under uncertainty the obtained function gives water managers a new perspective in the process of determining water storage scale and project construction in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the model attempted to improve local wue and achieve more efficient agricultural production furthermore the approach to obtain the relationship between water storage scale and objective of the optimization model as well as the developed framework in this study can serve as a reference for irrigation water resources planning practices for similar regions 5 conclusions in this study an interval multistage multiobjective stochastic programming immsp model and corresponding solving method mmd were developed to deal with multiple objectives multiple uncertainties and seasonal streamflow in planning irrigation water allocation besides the functional relationship between water storage capacity and objective of the optimization model was obtained which provide a new perspective when planning regional water storage scale the water allocation schemes were obtained responding to the dynamic changes of seasonally available irrigation water key factors in planning irrigation water resources such as random seasonal runoff interval uncertainty in data collection economic benefits water leakage loss and water deficit were fully considered in the immsp model in order to solve the immsp model the modified minimum deviation mmd method was proposed for dealing with uncertainties that existed in the multiobjective model the immsp model and mmd solving method was applied to a real world case of planning irrigation water allocation in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china and the results demonstrate that the proposed model is applicable to reflect expected problems and obtain better allocation schemes the functional relationship between water storage capacity and objective of the immsp in study area can be obtained as a quadratic function and optimized allocation schemes could contribute to local agricultural production a comparison was made to demonstrate that the results obtained by the proposed approach are more practical than those for the single objective with the same constraints this study tries to provide more information when planning water storage scale and allocate limited irrigation water through developing a mathematical model the developed immsp model mmd method and the calculation of the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of optimization model could be applied to other water planning problems especially the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of optimization model is first attempt to provide comments of water storage scale from the perspective of optimization model which will give water managers more supports when planning reasonable water storage scale the proposed approach can be applied to analyze the future variability of water availability and increasing demand support formulation of water planning schemes in other arid and semi arid regions however because water storage scale planning is a complicated study within many factors such as cost and environmental impacts this study can only give the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of optimization model instead of giving a determinate water storage scale for water managers the determination of a suitable regional water storage scale should be obtained based on more comprehensive research moreover the developed method can hardly tackle some detailed information such as describing the fuzziness in irrigation water allocation system reflecting the precise relationship functions between water supply and benefits and the influence of climate change these factors should be considered in future works acknowledgments this research was

10912,water managers in arid and semi arid areas must allocate limited irrigation water to different water use sectors considering the conflicting objectives seasonal runoff inflow and multiple uncertainties to deal with these problems an interval multiobjective multi stage stochastic programming immsp model was proposed for finding reasonable water storage scale and optimizing limited irrigation water resources key factors in planning irrigation water resources such as random seasonal runoff interval uncertainty in data collection economic benefits water leakage loss and water deficit were fully considered in the immsp model additionally as an important indicator to describe the seasonal water supply capability of local water supply project including reservoirs agricultural ponds and etc the water storage scale defined as the ratio of water storage capacity over total streamflow is proposed to obtain the quantitative relationship between this indicator and objective of immsp this study attempted to obtain the relationship between water storage scale and objective of immsp as well as provide a reference of determining water storage scale from the perspective of optimization in addition to solve the immsp model a modified minimum deviation mmd method was proposed for dealing with uncertainties making tradeoff among conflicting objectives and reflecting the different importance of objectives both the immsp model and mmd method were applied to a real world water allocation problem in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin for verifying its validity the solutions generate a set of decision alternatives under different seasonal runoff scenarios and further guide local water managers identify the optimal management strategies and project construction scale of water conservancy moreover a sound discussion of contribution to water storage scale planning is made and the comparisons between immsp and each single objective model economic benefits water leakage loss and water deficit in this study demonstrate that the results obtained by the proposed approach are more practical than a single objective with the same constraints these results can not only effectively contribute to local irrigation water management and ecological restoration but also provide more information to plan regional water storage scale values keywords water storage scale irrigation water allocation interval multiobjective programming interval multi stage stochastic programming 1 introduction water shortage crises caused by seasonal runoff inflow are occurring in arid and semi arid regions all around the world chen et al 2017 as water becomes increasingly scarce the fierce contradiction between the increase of water demand and limited water availability spark potential conflict among water users which calls for higher water use efficiency wue for agricultural production fu et al 2018 kang et al 2009 especially for arid and semi arid regions the significant difference of available irrigation water exists among different seasons which intensify the spatiotemporal asymmetry between irrigation water supply and demand and further cause more difficulties in regional policies making thus more effort should be made to fully use seasonal available water and improve agricultural wue li et al 2017a b as one of the significant tool to deal with the practical problems the mathematical model is widely used in addressing water shortage problems and obtaining optimal allocation schemes in the process of trying to solve specific problems series of optimization models have been developed such as single objective programming models multiobjective models two stage stochastic programming models and multistage programming models guo et al 2018 li et al 2010 guo et al 2009 with the gradual advancement of related research various uncertainties such as grey numbers fuzziness and randomness were fully considered when establishing optimization models to make full use of collected data and accurately describe practical problems li et al 2017a b kong et al 2017 liu et al 2017 these efforts successfully improve the practicality of the results of optimization model among optimization models interval multi stage stochastic programming imsp models show good performance in dealing with both seasonally available water featured as randomness and interval uncertainty caused by data collection chen et al 2017 in reality to obtain satisfied water allocation schemes more indicators have to be considered by water managers besides simply considering economic factors in the process of optimizing limited irrigation water for example crop quality guarantee irrigation water savings and water leakage loss are some real concerns of water managers and need to be taken into account to improve the practicality of the allocation schemes guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 when simultaneously considering these indicators in irrigation water management water managers may have to make tradeoff among multiple conflicting objectives however the imsp can hardly address conflicting objectives in practical allocation problems and related researches can be hardly found to tackle multiobjective problems in imsp framework so far thus this study attempts to develop an interval multiobjective multi stage stochastic programming immsp model based on imsp to simultaneously tackle multiple objectives seasonal streamflow and uncertainties for guiding regional water policies formulation when using immsp for optimizing limited irrigation water allocation the amounts of seasonally available water is the basis of the allocation zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 which would be directly affected by the condition of local water conservancy projects gaupp et al 2015 zhang 2009 water conservancy projects including reservoirs agricultural ponds and etc are built to ease the contradiction between water demand and water supply among seasons and play more and more important roles in agricultural production therefore the storage capacity designing of water conservancy projects is another planning problem faced by water managers beyond planning limited irrigation water planning storage capacity of water conservancy projects is a complex work that should take many aspects into consideration such as cost environmental impacts historical hydrology and agricultural development level sahin et al 2016 actually besides these factors decision makers need to know how it would influence the optimization allocation schemes which call for an indicator to reflect the storage capacity of water conservancy projects in the optimization model many indicators such as seasonal variability inter annual variability and upstream storage were introduced into water management to reflect the specific aspects when developing optimization models gassert et al 2015 but none of them can reflect the seasonal water storage capability of water conservancy projects thus a novel indicator water storage scale is proposed to measure the water storage capability of water conservancy projects during a season in this study the water storage scale is defined as the ratio of water storage capacity over total streamflow a higher regional water storage scale means a larger water storage capacity of water conservancy projects and thus brings higher flexibility in agricultural water management among seasons thus this study attempts to introduce the water storage scale into immsp model to obtain the quantitative relationship between this indicator and objective of immsp and further provide a reference of determining water storage scale from the perspective of optimization the water storage scale is regarded as a variable parameter in process of planning irrigation water allocation to observe how it affect the main indicators in planning which would give decision makers more information when planning regional water storage scale because immsp is a new model proposed to deal with practical problems a novel solving method need to be formulated based on existed methods for solving multiobjective problems many efforts have been made to obtain satisfied solutions via making tradeoffs among different objectives zhang et al 2018b ren et al 2019 for instance some bionic algorithms including genetic algorithm ant colony algorithm particle swarm algorithm and etc have shown the effectiveness in dealing with multiobjective programming models and obtain the pareto solution of the multiobjective programming models doerner et al 2004 yousefi et al 2018 guo et al 2018 but the complex program and frame structure influence the solving efficiency of bionic algorithms when requested to deal with uncertainties such as interval numbers in multiobjective bionic algorithms would face more difficulties due to its complexity the interval number is the number represented by the interval which is actually a set of all real numbers on a closed interval therefore some mathematical methods with the simple structure such as fuzzy coordination method efficacy coefficient method linear weighting method and minimum deviation method were proposed to solve multiobjective problems zhang et al 2019 wang and qiu 2013 lachhwani 2012 zhao et al 2017 the core ideology of these methods is to transform the multiobjective model into a single objective model via different methods which effectively simplify the solving process however some limitation existed in these methods when solving multiobjective programming for example the fuzzy coordination method efficacy coefficient method and minimum deviation method can hardly reflect the different importance of different objectives linear weighting method would face difficulty when dealing with multiple uncertainties thereupon the modified minimum deviation mmd method an integrated solving method coupling some key thinking of efficacy coefficient method linear weighting method and the minimum deviation method is proposed in this study mmd was formulated through borrowing the interval number processing method from efficacy coefficient method the way to deal with different importance of objectives from the linear weighting method and the tradeoff method among multiple objectives from the typical minimum deviation method these efforts allow mmd to tackle effectively the interval numbers and well reflect the different importance of objectives in multiobjective problems in this study mmd method is used for solving immsp model and identifying the optimal management strategies this study attempts to propose a new model immsp and corresponding solving method mmd to deal with the multiple complicities for optimizing irrigation water allocation besides water storage scale is considered in immsp to obtain the relationship between water storage scale and objective of immsp the immsp model makes the first attempt of coupling imsp and multiobjective programming in one framework which can 1 make the tradeoff among multiple conflicting objectives 2 deal with multiple uncertainties existed in optimization such as interval and stochastic 3 reflect the influence of the seasonal streamflow 4 provide a reference of determining water storage scale from the perspective of optimization additionally mmd method is a novel solving method developed for addressing interval multiobjective problems with reflecting the different importance of objectives then both the immsp model and mmd method were applied to a real world water allocation problem in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin a typical arid region in northwest china for verifying its validity the solutions will generate a set of decision alternatives under different seasonal runoff scenarios and further guide local water managers identify the optimal management strategies and project construction scale of water conservancy 2 methodology the technical framework of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 1 as demonstrated by this figure the methodology consists of three major components the imsp optimization model the immsp optimization and the modified minimum deviation method for solving the immsp model firstly the msp and ilp are integrated as imsp to deal with the randomness of seasonal runoff local policy target imprecise collected data and dynamics in water allocation based on imsp the immsp model is developed to address three conflicting objectives simultaneously then the interval numbers in immsp were replaced as deterministic numbers by their average value and then the objective value of three single objective models which come from the objectives of immsp were calculated under each water storage scale α through calculating the minimum deviation from the best objective value the minimum deviation md results of multiobjective multistage stochastic programming mmsp model with deterministic parameters under each α level can be obtained by the typical minimum deviation method thus the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of immsp model can be obtained finally the mmd method is used to solve immsp these will be described below in detail 2 1 interval multistage stochastic programming imsp in arid and semi arid regions the practical problem faced by agricultural water managers is allocating limited irrigation water to multiple users over a multi period planning horizon however water allocation among different stages such as different seasons and different crop growth stages is a complicated dynamic process because the water inflow and water demand of each stage are uncertain chen et al 2017 such a problem can be formulated as a multistage stochastic programming msp model which can deal with these complicated dynamic problems by taking corrective measures in subsequent periods after a random event has taken place li and huang 2007 a multistage scenario tree for allocating limited irrigation water to n irrigation districts among three seasons spring summer and autumn is shown in fig 2 to denote dynamic features in the associated stages there are four stages in the allocation period and stage 1 is the beginning of the water allocation water managers should plan the whole year water allocation in stage 1 before period 1 spring arrives seasonal random runoff inflow is divided into high flow level h medium flow level m and low flow level l to describe possible runoff inflow in each season therefore there are 33 kinds of possible scenarios during the whole crop growth period which creates 33 water allocation schemes in stage 1 due to the difficulty of collecting precise data for many practical problems some of the parameters collected for model inputs can be expressed as interval numbers therefore interval linear programming is integrated in the msp model resulting in interval multistage stochastic programming imsp zhang et al 2017 the typical imsp model for irrigation water allocation can be expressed as follows and parameters used are clarified in appendix i 1a max f i 1 i t 1 t b i t w d i t i 1 i t 1 t k 1 k t p t k c i t s i t k subject to 1b i 1 i w

variables are determined before the realizations of random variables are disclosed i e w d i t and recourse variables after the realized random event has occurred i e s i t k 2 2 interval multistage multiobjective stochastic programming immsp the imsp model can effectively solve the problem of allocating limited irrigation water to users among multiple periods considering the interval uncertainties that exist in the process of data collection however the typical imsp always focuses on achieving the single objective and it is unable to take multiple objectives into consideration simultaneously thus the interval multiobjective programming imp model can be used to make up for this deficiency of imsp a typical imp model can be written as follows 2a max f x j max f 1 x j f 2 x j f n x j subject to 2b j 1 j a x j b 2c c j x j d j 2d x j 0 where n is the number of the nonlinear objectives and j is the number of variables x j is a vector of interval decision variables f n x i are objectives a j b j c j and d j are the interval coefficients of constraints by integrating the imsp and imp model in a general framework an interval multistage multiobjective stochastic programming immsp model for optimizing irrigation water could be formulated as follows besides water storage scale is considered in constraint 3e and parameters used are clarified in table 1 objective

deviation method for solving immsp in order to solve multiobjective programming problems many approaches have been used to obtain satisfactory solutions such as the minimum deviation md method evolutionary algorithm method fuzzy goal programming method and efficiency coefficient method zhang et al 2018a 2019 wang and qiu 2013 lachhwani 2012 zhao et al 2017 although these methods can effectively address specific multiobjective problems such as linear multiobjective programming and interval multiobjective programming none of them can solve the newly developed immsp model in an effective and concise way because of the multiple uncertainties existence in immsp therefore a modified minimum deviation mmd method is proposed in this study as a potential tool to solve the immsp model the mmd method integrates the approach to dealing with interval numbers in the efficiency coefficient method and typical md method to solve immsp the main idea of the typical md method is to transform the multiobjective programming into single objective programming via making the tradeoff between the best and worst value of each objective the specific solution steps of the mmd method for solving immsp are denoted as follows step 1 convert every interval set x of the immsp model using the equation x x r δ x where δ x x x and r 0 1 thereby the immsp model was transformed to a typical multiobjective model which can be solved by the md method step 2 calculate the best and worst value of each objective f 1 max f 1 min f 2 max f 2 min f 3 max f 3 min step 3 to achieve the tradeoff between the best and worst value of each objective a single objective model can be obtained with the help of the results in step 2 based on md method besides each objective is given a weight to show its importance the corresponding objective of model 3 is 4 min f ω 1 f 1 max f 1 f 1 max f 1 min ω 2 f 2 f 2 min f 2 max f 2 min ω 3 f 3 f 3 min f 3 max f 3 min where f is the total weighted deviation of three objectives ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 are the weights of each objective given by water managers which can be obtained by the analytic hierarchy process ahp method f 1 f 2 f 3 are the objectives in model 3 the constraints of this reformulated model are the same as model 3 step 4 after replacing the objectives in model 3 by eqs 4 the immsp model can be transformed as an interval single objective model then the typical two step interactive algorithm for solving interval programming is used to solve the above problem by decomposing the model into two sub models in two step interactive algorithm the solution corresponding to f lower bound sub model should be firstly solved and the relevant solution corresponding to f upper bound sub model is feasible as one of the two bounds of the interval number the lower bound submodel and upper bound submodel can be formulated as follows lower bound submodel 5a min f m 1 k 1 c m x m m k 1 1 m c m x m subject to 5b m 1 k 1 a m p s i g n a m p x m m k 1 1 m a m p s i g n a m p x m b j 5c x m x m 0 where x m m 1 2 k 1 and x m m k 1 1 k 1 2 m are the decision variables with negative and positive coefficients in the objective functions c m are the coefficients of decision variables s i g n a m p 1 i f a m p 0 1 i f a m p 0 after solving lower bound submodel the optimal solutions x m o p t m 1 2 k 1 and x m o p t m k 1 1 k 1 2 m can be obtained upper bound submodel 6a min f m 1 k 1 c m x m m k 1 1 m c m x m subject to 6b m 1 k 1 a m p s i g n a m p x m m k 1 1 m a m p s i g n a m p x m b j 6c 0 x m x m o p t m k 1 1 k 1 2 m 6d x m x m o p t m 1 2 k 1 step 5 the interval solution can be obtained by integrating the solutions of two sub models and final solution of the immsp model would be generated 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area is in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin 97 37 102 06 e 37 44 42 40 n gansu province northwest china with an arid climate and limited rainfall it includes three administrative regions including ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county as shown in fig 3 the middle reaches can be divided into seventeen irrigation districts ids and the water consumption in the middle reaches accounts for over 80 of the whole heihe river basin due to high evapotranspiration and little precipitation irrigation is of great significance for agricultural production in the middle reaches with the rapid development of agriculture in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin where agriculture irrigation occupies approximately 90 of the total water consumption li et al 2015 the conflict between increased irrigation water demand and limited irrigation water is intensified as a way to relieve conflicts more groundwater has been exploited to guarantee agricultural production thus groundwater level decline and ecosystem destruction occur in the middle reaches in addition with less surface water flow into the lower reaches desertification in downstream basins gradually becomes more serious which makes the lower reaches of the heihe a major sandstorm place of origin in china hence managers have realized that it is necessary to limit the water use in the middle reaches especially agricultural water consumption this will result in more intense competition among water users because of fewer available irrigation water resources therefore how to optimally allocate limited irrigation water resources under seasonal stream flow and thus improve agricultural water use efficiency have become growing urgent issues for sustainable agriculture zhang and guo 2017 for arid and semi arid regions like middle reaches of heihe river basin the formulation of water allocation schemes should take more indicators into account besides economic benefit for example although the leakage loss occurred in the water delivery process contributes to groundwater restoration the exploitation of these groundwater consume more energy and labor which increase the cost and environmental pollution thus decreasing the leakage loss in irrigation is considered by water managers when forming irrigation water allocation policy the practical allocation problems become more complex touching upon uncertainties and multiple objectives in existing agricultural systems the first problem faced by local water managers is to plan a suitable water storage scale to guarantee adequate and stable irrigation water among seasons thus water managers have to obtain the relationship how water storage scale influence the allocation objectives which will provide a new perspective to determine the proper water storage scale for this region 3 2 parameter determination to obtain the optimal allocation schemes from the immsp model many input parameters are necessary including socioeconomic data among different irrigation districts ids information about irrigation water allocation targets and water availabilities of each season the streamflow in this study is the total runoff flow of each season obtained from the yingluo gorge hydrological station the yingluo gorge is the boundary between upstream and middle reaches table 2 presents the total available irrigation water and its probabilities during a whole crop growth period in different stages the available surface water is divided into three discrete intervals associated with probability distributions to obtain the inflows a pearson type iii distribution was used in this study to obtain the distribution of surface water inflow with the help of statistical data from the annual runoff of the yingluoxia hydrological station during 1945 to 2013 then the category of three inflow levels can be calculated based on frequency analysis li et al 2016 table 3 shows the irrigation water target demand and effective rainfall in different ids of each season the water allocation targets and minimum water demand of different ids in each season were estimated based on statistical the historical data besides the effective rainfall is obtained from the multi year average effective rainfall table 4 provides related socioeconomic statistical data for the study area these data were collected from historical data survey data and the statistical yearbook of zhangye city for the years 2002 2016 the actual water storage scale is 0 146 which can be calculated from gansu water resources bulletin furthermore as key parameters to solving immsp via mmd the weights of each objective ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 were calculated by ahp method through making pairwise contrast among three objectives by regional water managers according to the practical conditions a pairwise comparison judgment matrix can be established easily zhang et al 2018a and further the importance weight of each objective can be obtained the pairwise comparison and calculated weights is shown in table 5 according to the ahp theory the consistency ratio is acceptable if it does not exceed 0 10 which shows that the judgment matrix is consistent table 5 shows that the obtained importance weights are acceptable in this study 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 optimization of water resources using the methodology and basic data the immsp model can be solved optimal allocation results of irrigation water resources were obtained as fig 4 there are 33 allocation scenarios according to the scenario tree in fig 2 the allocation results change with dynamic seasonal flow levels and provide a specific irrigation water allocation scheme for local water managers fig 4 shows the status quo 2015 water allocation scheme and the total water and groundwater allocation results under all 27 possible scenarios hhh hhm hhl hmh hmm hml hlh hlm hll mhh mhm mhl mmh mmm mml mlh mlm mll lhh lhm lhl lmh lmm lml llh llm lll h m l indicate high medium low flow level respectively among seventeen irrigation districts in three seasons spring summer autumn which provide water managers a range of allocation strategies in response to the uncertainties existing in the decision making process when water deficit occurs the smaller irrigation areas are more susceptible to negative effects according to the optimization results that is optimization results obtained from immsp model tend to allocate limited water to the ids with higher wue and iw and further help agricultural water managers rank the allocation order among ids and find the water allocation threshold moreover it can be found that surface water is preferentially used for irrigation in most of irrigation districts which may contribute to local groundwater level recovery and ecological restoration for giving water managers more intuitive reference toward the optimization schemes some important indicators that water managers concerned were calculated based on the optimization results fig 5 a shows the total water allocation under each scenario it can be found that the irrigation water allocated in summer occupy the largest water consume around a year that is summer is the most important season and the available irrigation water in summer have obviously influence on agricultural production in addition three objectives of immsp under each scenario were calculated and shown in fig 5 b fig 5 c and fig 5 d respectively the economic benefit and possible irrigation water leakage loss has the positive correlation relationship with the total water allocation which can be easily understood that more available water could bring higher irrigation water leakage loss during water allocation and higher economic benefit to measure the efficiency of water use two indicators economic benefit per unit water bpuw and water use efficiency wue were calculated and shown in fig 5 bpuw and wue are respectively defined as the ratio of economic benefit over total irrigation water used and the ratio of the effective water that can be used by the crop over total irrigation water used these two indicators and irrigation water deficit fig 5 b reflect the opposite trend with other indicators among different scenarios according to the optimization results if water deficit occurred in agricultural production the total possible economic benefit would decrease while the use efficiency of limited water would be improved this reminds water managers that although both economic benefit and efficiency are what they want the contradiction between these two factors has to be considered when planning local water policies these results obtained by immsp can provide local water managers possible values of benefits water loss and water deficit under corresponding water allocation schemes water managers can choose suitable irrigation water allocation schemes according to the actual runoff information from table 1 moreover useful suggestions could be proposed to improve local wue such as construction of water storage and canal seepage prevention projects in summary seasonal runoff inflow has significant impacts on the economic benefit irrigation water leakage loss and efficiency of water use as the seasonal runoff inflow plays such an important role in agricultural production water storage scale an indicator that have a direct influence on available water in each season need to be planned for making full use of limited irrigation water among seasons 4 2 contribution to water storage scale planning the water storage scale α is an important parameter for determining regional available water and the basis of solving the immsp model the relationship between α and objectives including three single objective and multiobjective can be obtained and provide more information for water managers when determining proper water storage scale following the calculation process shown in the study framework fig 1 the objective results of these models under different α levels and the quantified relationship between α and the objective of immsp can be obtained as fig 6 shows with the increase of α level it can be found that economic benefit fig 6 a was improved that is the higher water storage capacity can contribute to the economic benefit in the study area conversely leakage loss fig 6 b and weighted water shortage fig 6 c go down with increasing water storage capacity which indicates that larger water storage capacity could not only help save more irrigation water from leakage loss but also decrease the irrigation water deficit besides it is noteworthy that these two indicators become steady when α is greater than 0 2 and the rate of all model growth is slower with increasing α values the minimum deviation fig 6 d can be obtained via md method and the functional relationship between water storage scale and minimum deviation is y 0 3939 x 2 0 3177 x 0 1663 with a high deterministic coefficient zhang et al 2019 0 9941 it can be found that larger water storage capacity can likely help obtain better water allocation schemes however when determining suitable water storage scale more meaningful factors including the construction cost and environmental influence of water storage project need to be considered the functional relationship obtained in this study can give water managers one more support beside typical factors to plan a reasonable water storage capacity scale α according to the field survey the actual water storage scale of study area is around 0 146 but the construction of local water storage project is continuously going on thus these information can help local water managers understand how the water storage scale will affect the agricultural production under future possible scenario 4 3 discussion this study aims to develop an integrated model immsp for irrigation water allocation three contradictory goals i e system economic benefit irrigation water leakage loss and water deficit were considered simultaneously in the immsp to prove the effectiveness of the immsp model in combining the three objectives the target value comparison between the immsp model and each single objective model was made in table 6 as shown in table 6 the single objective model can obtain the best value of that objective but cannot consider other important aspects on the contrary the immsp model can effectively consider tradeoffs among the three objectives including maximizing system net benefit objective 1 minimizing total leakage loss objective 2 and minimizing water deficit objective 3 by obtaining the best coordinated satisfaction of these objectives the targets calculated by the developed model are close to the optimization value of the single objective models which indicates that the developed immsp model can make tradeoff among three different objective functions immsp can simultaneously address the seasonal streamflow multi stage decision making process and multiple objectives under uncertainty in one framework which can simplify the optimization process and better reflect the practical problem faced by water managers in managing limited irrigation water resources additionally the relationship between the water storage scale and objective of the immsp model can be obtained for guiding local decision makers to plan future water conservancy project construction immsp give water managers a new reference for planning the regional water storage scale from the perspective of optimization to make full use of seasonal streamflow and further improve wue in this study all in all the immsp model can not only provide the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of the optimization model for local water managers but also obtain optimized water allocation schemes via coordinating the three objectives under uncertainty the obtained function gives water managers a new perspective in the process of determining water storage scale and project construction in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the model attempted to improve local wue and achieve more efficient agricultural production furthermore the approach to obtain the relationship between water storage scale and objective of the optimization model as well as the developed framework in this study can serve as a reference for irrigation water resources planning practices for similar regions 5 conclusions in this study an interval multistage multiobjective stochastic programming immsp model and corresponding solving method mmd were developed to deal with multiple objectives multiple uncertainties and seasonal streamflow in planning irrigation water allocation besides the functional relationship between water storage capacity and objective of the optimization model was obtained which provide a new perspective when planning regional water storage scale the water allocation schemes were obtained responding to the dynamic changes of seasonally available irrigation water key factors in planning irrigation water resources such as random seasonal runoff interval uncertainty in data collection economic benefits water leakage loss and water deficit were fully considered in the immsp model in order to solve the immsp model the modified minimum deviation mmd method was proposed for dealing with uncertainties that existed in the multiobjective model the immsp model and mmd solving method was applied to a real world case of planning irrigation water allocation in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china and the results demonstrate that the proposed model is applicable to reflect expected problems and obtain better allocation schemes the functional relationship between water storage capacity and objective of the immsp in study area can be obtained as a quadratic function and optimized allocation schemes could contribute to local agricultural production a comparison was made to demonstrate that the results obtained by the proposed approach are more practical than those for the single objective with the same constraints this study tries to provide more information when planning water storage scale and allocate limited irrigation water through developing a mathematical model the developed immsp model mmd method and the calculation of the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of optimization model could be applied to other water planning problems especially the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of optimization model is first attempt to provide comments of water storage scale from the perspective of optimization model which will give water managers more supports when planning reasonable water storage scale the proposed approach can be applied to analyze the future variability of water availability and increasing demand support formulation of water planning schemes in other arid and semi arid regions however because water storage scale planning is a complicated study within many factors such as cost and environmental impacts this study can only give the functional relationship between water storage scale and objective of optimization model instead of giving a determinate water storage scale for water managers the determination of a suitable regional water storage scale should be obtained based on more comprehensive research moreover the developed method can hardly tackle some detailed information such as describing the fuzziness in irrigation water allocation system reflecting the precise relationship functions between water supply and benefits and the influence of climate change these factors should be considered in future works acknowledgments this research was

10913,in arid areas agricultural development can occur at the expense of ecosystem conservation and water quality to balance the conflicting interests the water ecosystem agriculture wea nexus in such areas needs to be systematically addressed in this study a multi objective linear fractional programming molfp approach is proposed to model the synergies and tradeoffs in the wea nexus using this approach the impacts of changes in hydrological conditions land use and the water management regime on the economic ecological and environmental efficiencies of the agricultural system in zhangye basin zb a typical arid area in northwestern china were assessed the major study findings are as follows first the molfp approach can effectively identify solutions for optimization problems with multiple interrelated ratio type objectives and the optimization results intrinsically reflect the behavior of the socioeconomic system second in wet conditions the agricultural system can be more profitable and environmentally friendly but less efficient in saving water for the ecosystems in the downstream area third the potential land use conversion from croplands into fallow or built up areas as well as the new water quality regulation may lead to co benefits of economic ecological and environmental efficiencies finally the flexibility to adjust the spatial pattern of crop planting makes the agricultural system in zb exhibit good resilience to water land and food stresses however the resilience is seriously impaired under very dry conditions and dramatic land use changes overall this study lays out a new framework for addressing the complex wea nexus through system modeling and provides insights into agriculture planning and water resources management in arid areas keywords water ecosystem agriculture nexus food security ecological flow nonpoint source pollution multiobjective optimization fractional programming 1 introduction agricultural development is inextricably linked with land use change water and energy consumption and nonpoint source pollution in many cases decisions on agricultural development are made without considering cross sectoral interactions e g interactions among crop production socioeconomic development and water and land conservation and externalities such as water pollution finley and seiber 2014 vora et al 2017 this single minded approach to decision making may yield suboptimal solutions leading to unintended and detrimental consequences especially when the economic objective conflicts with environmental ecological or social objectives bhaduri et al 2015 david et al 2015 with the aim of addressing sustainable development goals sdgs a shift from the sole goal of economic maximization to a multiobjective evaluation is necessary weitz et al 2014 recently the human nature nexus framework has been adopted to better anticipate otherwise unforeseen consequences evaluate tradeoffs produce cobenefits and allow competing interests to seek a common ground and cooptimization liu et al 2015 complex nexuses centered on water such as the food energy water few nexus represent a new paradigm that allows interdisciplinary research to progress and study outcomes to be implemented in real world management cai et al 2018 in this paradigm a system modeling approach can be implemented to quantitatively address cross sectoral synergies and tradeoffs and to support integrated management endo et al 2015 hurford and harou 2014 however the appropriate incorporation of human and institutional behaviors in the system model needs further studies in arid and semiarid regions a typical water ecosystem agriculture wea nexus exists as conceptualized in fig 1 agriculture is often a main industry in such areas and production of food and economic crops is critical to socioeconomic development of the local communities through land use changes irrigation and application of fertilizers and pesticides agriculture can substantially modify the hydrological cycle in terms of both water quality and quantity gordon et al 2010 depletion of both surface and subsurface water resources by irrigation often leads to degradation of vegetation and loss of wetlands e g riparian zones and terminal lakes of inland rivers falkenmark and lannerstad 2005 finlayson and d cruz 2005 these ecological consequences will in turn jeopardize sustainability of the agriculture this typical nexus represents an enormous challenge to balance economic ecological and environmental interests in the planning and management of agricultural water cai et al 2018 niu et al 2016 decisions based on sound science are highly desired to reflect conflicting interests multiobjective programming mop has been widely implemented for example maino et al 1993 applied a multiobjective mathematical model to aid in understanding the structure and function of farming systems and in evaluating the potential impact of different technological and rural development activities raju and kumar 1999 developed a model to optimize the irrigation plan of the sri ram sagar project andhra pradesh india taking into account net benefits and labor employment xevi and khan 2005 addressed optimal crop pattern and water management by considering three objective functions maximizing net returns minimizing variable cost and minimizing groundwater pumping georgiou and papamichail 2008 integrated a nonlinear programming optimization model with a soil water balance calculation and investigated the optimal reservoir release policies irrigation allocation to multiple crops and optimal cropping pattern zheng et al 2013 solved a mop problem for oil crop fertilization in which crop yield and quality energy consumption and environmental effects were considered however few studies simultaneously considered economic benefit water pollution and ecological flow within the context of agricultural development in arid and semiarid regions in previous mop studies on agricultural systems different methods were used to select satisfactory nondominant solutions such as weighting methods marler and arora 2010 e constrained approaches yokoyama et al 1988 goal programming pal et al 2003 and fuzzy programming methods li et al 2014 in real world management decisions for problems may inherently rely on ratios between individual objectives chakraborty and gupta 2002 for example in water limited areas agricultural profit per unit of irrigation water apiw is a critical measure of the system performance cai et al 2003 and combines two individual objective variables economic profit i e the benefit and water consumption i e the cost the above classic methods may inappropriately handle integrating objectives with fractional forms fractional programming fp is an effective mathematical programming approach for solving ratio optimization problems charnes et al 1978 stancu minasian 2012 during the last decade fp has been applied in different disciplines such as financial analysis toksarı 2008 power generation planning chen et al 2015 aggregate production planning wang and liang 2004 and others castrodeza et al 2005 leber et al 2005 veeramani and sumathi 2016 the advantages of fp over classic methods for multiobjective ratio optimization problems have been well demonstrated for example zhu et al 2014 applied fp to solve an energy system planning problem and the optimization generates flexible schemes of resource allocations and facility expansions towards sustainable energy management zappone and jorswieck 2015 proposed a framework of energy efficiency maximization based on fp and successfully applied it in practical wireless networks shen and yu 2018 used fp in the design and optimization of communication systems i e power control beamforming and energy efficiency maximization multiobjective linear fractional programming molfp integrates fp with mop and is able to address multiple objectives in fractional formulas de and deb 2015 in our literature survey this approach has rarely been applied in the agricultural field and its potential to address complex nexus issues has not been explored the present study develops a molfp model for optimizing crop structure and its associated irrigation water demands in the context of a wea nexus the molfp model is then applied to a case study in zhangye basin zb a typical semiarid to arid area in northwestern china zb is the midstream section of the heihe river basin hrb the second largest inland river basin in china the irrigated farmlands in zb consume a large amount of river flow and groundwater wu et al 2014 which has caused serious environmental problems in the lower hrb such as desertification ji et al 2006 salinization wen et al 2005 and shrinkage of the terminal lake i e east juyan lake guo et al 2009 in addition agricultural development has increased the risk of nonpoint pollution e g nutrients and pesticides in zb the wea nexus in zb is typical of the vast inland areas in china chen et al 2003 ma et al 2005 as well as in other parts of the world such as central asia cretaux et al 2013 varis 2014 the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to develop a molfp approach to modeling the synergies and tradeoffs among agricultural production ecological conservation and water security in arid areas from a system efficiency perspective 2 to simulate the response of the wea nexus in zb to varying hydrologic conditions in relation to potential climate change land use changes induced by potential socioeconomic shifts and water quality regulation and 3 to investigate the resilience of the agricultural system in zb under water land and food stresses overall the study results can provide insights into agriculture planning and water resources management in arid areas with extensive agricultural development 2 multiobjective linear fractional programming molfp molfp addresses optimization problems with multiple ratio objectives that are conflicting or noncommensurable in this study a newly proposed solution is employed to solve molfp problems the solution is based on the theorem by dinkelbach dinkelbach 1967 and the approach by güzel güzel 2013 a molfp problem can be mathematically expressed as described by chakraborty and gupta 2002 1a m a x i m i z e f 1 n 1 x d 1 x f 2 n 2 x d 2 x f k n k x d k x 1b subject to a x b 1c x 0 where x r n 1 a r m n b r m 1 and n i x c i t x α i d i x d i t x β i for all i 1 2 k c i t d i t r 1 n α i β i r and d i x 0 for all i 1 2 k the solution for the molfp problem in equation 1 is a nonempty and bounded set and each of the objective functions is continuously differentiable for each objective in the molfp problem max f n x d x a x b a n d x 0 where f represents a function form dinkelbach dinkelbach 1967 suggested that f n x d x would be an optimal solution if and only if z x f m a x z n x f d x a x b a n d x 0 0 where x is the global maximum point and f is the respective value of the objective function the fractional programming problem can be solved in a finite number of iterations as follows 1 transform the objective function f n x d x to a nonfractional function z n x q d x with parameter q appropriately initialized 2 obtain the values of x 1 and f 1 by the simplex algorithm brearley et al 1975 and then calculate z 1 where the superscript indicates the iteration number 3 if z 1 approximates zero i e less than 0 001 the iteration process for solving the single linear fraction problem is ended and the objective function f equals q 4 otherwise the initial value of q is updated to q n x 1 d x 1 and 5 repeat these steps until z approximates zero thereby obtaining the global optimal point x and the f value different approaches have been proposed to solve molfp problems charnes and cooper 1962 solved a molfp problem by transforming it into two linear programming problems chakraborty and gupta 2002 explored a procedure to solve molfp problems using a fuzzy set theoretical approach based on suitably defined membership functions and using a min operator as the aggregator pal et al 2003 investigated a linearization process of solving fuzzy molfp problems via a minsum goal programming procedure pramanik et al 2011 and toksarı 2008 used the taylor series to transform a molfp problem to a normal multiobjective linear programming problem recently güzel 2013 proposed a new solution to molfp according to güzel 2013 a feasible solution x is an efficient solution if it is an optimal solution to the problem m a x i m i z e i 1 k n i x g i d i x a x b and x 0 where g i n i x i d i x i for all i and x i represents the global optima of the individual maximization problems max f i n i x d i x a x b and x 0 thus the molfp problem can be reduced to a single objective nonfractional linear programming problem bhati and singh 2017 2a m a x i m i z e z i i 1 k n i x g i d i x 2b subject to a x b 2c x 0 this solution can be easily programmed using existing tools such as lingo and matlab this new approach has been successful applied to solve a tri objective linear programming problem for generation expansion planning chen et al 2015 and is adopted by this study in summary the solution approach for the multiobjective linear programming model consists of the following steps 1 for each objective function in the multiobjective linear fractional programming model obtain the optimal solution and respective objective value based on the dinkelbach approach 2 convert the multiobjective linear fractional programming model into a single objective linear programming model using güzel s approach 3 solve the single objective linear programming model to obtain a solution to the original multiobjective linear programming model and 4 stop 3 data and methods 3 1 study area the zhangye basin zb in gansu province china is chosen as the study area fig 2 zb is in the midstream part of the heihe river basin hrb the second largest inland river basin in china zb is a typical semiarid to arid inland area the total area of zb is approximately 36 551 km2 the elevation increases from 1290 m in the northwest to 2200 m in the southeast the annual rainfall is approximately 190 mm which occurs mainly from june to september and the annual potential evapotranspiration et is approximately 1325 mm wu et al 2014 the main heihe river brings approximately 1 72 billion m3 yr of streamflow from the qilian mountains on the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau to zb through yingluoxia the agriculture in zb consumes a large share of the streamflow wu et al 2015 due to the rapid increase in irrigation water consumption in zb the river discharge through zhengyixia experienced a significant decrease in the 1990s leading to serious ecological problems e g drying up of the terminal lakes and death of culturally significant populus euphratica forests in the lower hrb chen et al 2005 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 these problems were not alleviated until the central government started to restrict the streamflow diversion in 2000 however the diversion restriction has stimulated groundwater pumping in zb which has not been well regulated as a result the groundwater storage in zb has been declining recently which poses potential environmental and ecological risks to the zb tian et al 2015 zb is located within the administrative boundary of zhangye city and mainly covers three subareas of the city ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county see fig 2 these three subareas have the most productive farmlands in the basin which are all fed by the main heihe river maize wheat and vegetables are the main types of crops in zb the structural percentage of the main crops and other cultivated crops are presented in table 1 as of 2016 the aggregated agricultural benefit of zhangye city was approximately 102 42 billion rmb yuan approximately 1 49 billion accounting for 25 61 of the city s gdp gssy 2016 as conceptualized in fig 3 the water ecosystem agriculture wea nexus in this area is complex before 2000 the intensive agricultural irrigation in zb had dramatically decreased the river flow towards the downstream region of hrb and had caused serious ecological problems such as shrinkage of the terminal lake death of populus euphratica and increased frequency of sandstorms cheng et al 2014 since 2000 a water allocation plan has been strictly enforced by the central government in zb and specifies that the streamflow volume through zhengyixia should be secured under different hydrologic conditions in a normal year i e 1 58 billion m3 inflow at yingluoxia for example the outflow from zhengyixia should be no less than 0 95 billion m3 while the allocation plan has resulted in recovery of the downstream ecosystems the agriculture mainly for food production keeps expanding and more groundwater is exploited in zb posing a risk to the sustainability of the groundwater resources and wetland ecosystems in zb in addition agricultural development may introduce the risk of nonpoint source pollution due to the increasing use of fertilizers and pesticides the complex wea nexus greatly challenges the regional decision makers who have to balance food water and ecological securities in this undeveloped and environmentally sensitive area the nexus may also evolve rapidly through time one important driving force may be climate change or climate variation the conflict among the food water and ecological sectors is largely conditional on the inflow from the upstream mountainous area recently the conflict has been relatively mild partially due to the wet conditions in the upstream areas however whether the wet conditions reflect a tendency of climate change or just a part of the normal dry wet cycle is unclear the decision makers have to be prepared for potential droughts another important driving force may be urbanization with the belt and road initiative bri of china liu and dunford 2016 inland china is anticipated to have more infrastructure construction and faster urbanization which may lead to a reduction in cultivated land zb sits on a vital passageway of the ancient silk road and is currently an important part of the silk road economic belt the belt third a change in the water management regime may also impact the nexus at present the availability of water resources is the focus of water management in zb however as the population grows and urbanization and industrialization proceed water quality problems may become relevant soon and water management may have to incorporate measures for pollution prevention and control as fig 3 illustrates this study performs system modeling for the wea nexus and investigates how the agricultural system will evolve under potential climatic and socioeconomic variations the molfp approach is adopted for the system model considering economic ecological and environmental objectives the optimization represents a planning procedure by which appropriate crop areas and structures are determined to cope with the variations the optimization results intrinsically reflect the behavior of the socioeconomic system in zb the molfp model will be introduced in detail later see section 3 3 the molfp model also incorporates a key relationship in the wea nexus derived based on an integrated hydrological model see section 3 2 3 2 a key relationship in the wea nexus to investigate the wea nexus a quantitative description of the water system in zb is necessary our previous studies have built an integrated hydrological model for zb wu et al 2014 2016 using gsflow coupled ground water and surface water flow model markstrom et al 2008 the gsflow model provides spatially and temporally detailed simulations of the regional water cycle but involving such a complex model in an optimization study is computationally difficult wu et al 2016 established a multiple linear regression model to quantify the relationship among the upstream inflow through yingluoxia qy the total irrigation water in zb d the outflow towards the downstream through zhengyixia qz and the groundwater storage change in zb δs based on the gsflow simulations under a number of different scenarios the regression model is as follows 3 δ s β 0 β 1 d β 2 q y β 3 q z ε where all β s are the regression coefficients and ε is a gaussian error term in our previous study wu et al 2016 the regression coefficients were estimated as β ˆ 0 0 2840 β ˆ 1 0 6312 β ˆ 2 0 8270 and β ˆ 3 0 5542 with the coefficient of determination r 2 being 0 9030 in the optimization analyses of this study this multiple linear regression model is used as the surrogate model of the original gsflow model 3 3 molfp model this study develops a molfp model to optimize the crop area and structure while simultaneously considering economic ecological and environmental objectives focusing on investigating the system efficiencies in these three aspects three ratio type objectives are formulated the decision variables are the planting areas of different crops in ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county a number of constraints associated with water and land availabilities crop nutrient balance and soil erosion in farmlands are incorporated all the calculations are on an annual average basis the objectives and constraints are introduced in the details below 1 three ratio type objectives the economic objective this objective is to maximize the agricultural profit per unit of irrigation water hereafter denoted as apiw in zb which factors in the revenue and major costs of the crop production this objective reflects the economic efficiency of the irrigation system in zb and is actually the productivity of irrigation water it can be expressed as follows 4 maximize a p i w r 1 r j 1 j y c r j p c r t a r j r 1 r j 1 j c a r t a r j c f r 1 r j 1 j h j t a r j c m r 1 r j 1 j f j t a r j r 1 r j 1 j i q r j t a r j where r indicates the primary crop types with r 1 2 and 3 representing wheat vegetable and maize respectively j is the subarea id with j 1 to 3 representing gaotai county linze county and ganzhou district respectively ycrj is the yield of crop r in subarea j kg ha pcr is the market price of crop r kg which is exogenous because the local production would not have a significant influence on the market price tarj is the total area of crop r in subarea j ha i e the decision variables carj is the total farming cost for crop r in subarea j which covers seed irrigation and labor expenses ha cm is the cost of compound fertilizer application t cf is the cost of nitrogenous fertilizer application t and cf and cm were referenced from the data by zhang et al 2009 and zhang et al 2014 hj is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer per unit area applied in subarea j t ha fj is the amount of compound fertilizer per unit area applied in subarea j t ha and h j and f j were obtained from gssy 2016 and iqrj is the irrigation quota i e the annual irrigation demand for crop r in subarea j m3 ha the irrigation quota is a gross requirement that is back calculated by dividing the net irrigation requirement by the irrigation efficiency the information of the net irrigation requirement and irrigation efficiency was obtained from the water resources bureau of zhangye city note that the us dollar is used as the currency and the average exchange rate in 2017 is referenced here the ecological objective this objective is to maximize the ecological flow to the lower hrb i e qz per unit of agricultural profit hereafter denoted as efap this objective reflects the water saving efficiency of agricultural production in zb by incorporating the key relationship i e eq 3 introduced in section 3 2 the objective can be written as 5 maximize e f a p δ s β ˆ 0 β ˆ 1 d β ˆ 2 q y β ˆ 3 r 1 r j 1 j y c r j p c r t a r j r 1 r j 1 j c a r t a r j c f r 1 r j 1 j h j t a r j c m r 1 r j 1 j f j t a r j the environmental objective as a major agricultural nonpoint source pollutant total nitrogen tn is considered as the target of water quality management the third objective is therefore to minimize the agricultural nonpoint source loading of tn per unit of agricultural profit hereafter denoted as tnap as follows 6 minimize t n a p r 1 r j 1 j m p r t a r j r 1 r j 1 j y c r j p c r t a r j r 1 r j 1 j c a r t a r j c f r 1 r j 1 j h j t a r j c m r 1 r j 1 j f j t a r j where mpr is the annual export coefficient of tn pollutants for agricultural arable land kg ha in the study area which adopts the values reported by li and zhuang 2003 this objective reflects the fertilizer use efficiency of agriculture production in zb 2 constraints the constraint of water availability as mentioned before streamflow diversion in the midstream area is limited by the water allocation regulation such that a certain amount of ecological flow can be secured for the downstream area in addition because the regulation has prompted groundwater exploitation and has therefore triggered a decline in groundwater storage groundwater pumping is currently regulated in parts of the study area to reflect the management background the following constraint is considered 7 r 1 r j 1 j i q r j t a r j s w g w sw in this constraint represents the amount of streamflow in the main heihe river that is diverted to the farmlands in the three administrative areas according to the historical data from 2000 to 2012 a polynomial relationship between sw and qy i e the inflow from the mountainous area through yingluoxia was determined as s w 0 023 q y 2 1 333 q y 5 473 r 2 0 971 gw in this constraint represents the average amount of allowed groundwater pumping the actual average amount from 2000 to 2012 considered here is 0 59 billion m3 yr eq 7 assumes that the exploitation of water resources for irrigation is not allowed to exceed the historical level between 2000 and 2012 the constraint of crop nutrient balance following zhang et al 2009 nitrogen balance is considered to constrain the optimization as follows 8 r 1 r j 1 j 1 p 1 n m f j t a r j r 1 r j 1 j 1 p 2 h j t a r j r 1 r j 1 j n r r t a r j where p1 is the nitrogen volatilization denitrification annual rate of compound fertilizer p2 is the nitrogen volatilization denitrification annual rate of nitrogenous fertilizer nm is the nitrogen content of compound fertilizer nrr is the nitrogen demand of crop r kg n ha and all other variables have been previously defined the constraint of soil erosion crop cultivation can change the degree of soil erosion this optimization study assumes that the total amount of soil eroded from the farmlands should not exceed a certain level 9 r 1 r j 1 j s l r t a r j m a j 1 j k j where ma is the maximum allowed rate of soil loss kg ha in the three administrative areas slr is the soil loss from the total cultivation area of crop r kg ha and kj is the maximum tillable land in subarea j ha the constraint of food security food security is the number 1 mission of china s agricultural development zb is one of the food production bases in northwest china and the cultivation of food crops in zb is important to regional food security naturally a considerable portion of the cultivated lands must be reserved for food production the following constraint is proposed to reflect this concern of food security 10 t a 1 j t a 1 j 0 1 α t a 3 j t a 3 j 0 1 α j where t a 1 j 0 and t a 3 j 0 are the cultivation areas of wheat and maize respectively in 2016 ha and α is the acceptable maximum reduction ratio with regard to the conditions in 2016 which is set to be 30 in this study the reduced cultivation area could be turned into fallow or built up areas the constraint of land availability the total cultivation area in each subarea must be less than the maximum tillable land in that subarea 11 r 1 r t a r j k j j the nonnegativity constraint all the decision variables must be nonnegative that is 12 t a r j 0 r j following güzel s approach see section 2 the above tri objective linear programming model can be converted into the following single objective linear programming model 13 maximization a p i w e f a p t n a p maximization a p i w n g 1 a p i w d e f a p n g 2 e f a p d t n a p n g 3 t n a p d where g 1 g 2 and g 3 represent the global maximum values of the three objective functions apiw efap and tnap respectively the subscripts n and d indicate the numerator and denominator respectively of the objective function these maximum values need to be determined separately first subject to the constraints introduced above to appropriately parameterize the molfp model data were collected from various sources including the literature statistical yearbooks and reports by the local government table 2 presents the parameter values and their references 3 4 solution of the traditional weighted sum approach to examine the effectiveness of the molfp approach in finding optimal solutions a traditional weighted sum approach marler and arora 2010 is applied in parallel and it is compared against the proposed approach in the baseline scenario the objective function in the traditional approach is 14 m ax i m i z a t i o n λ 1 a p i w a p i w λ 2 e f a p e f a p λ 3 t n a p t n a p where apiw efap and tnap represent the global maximum maximum and minimum values of the individual optimization problems maximize apiw maximize efap and minimize tnap respectively and are subject to the constraints of 7 to 12 λ1 λ2 and λ3 are three positive weights subject to λ1 λ2 λ3 1 in this traditional approach λ1 λ2 and λ3 are determined by a subjective preference weighting method and are eventually set to 0 4 0 4 and 0 2 respectively in this study 3 5 climate and socioeconomic scenarios this study investigates potential changes in the wea nexus under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios from a planning perspective i e based on the optimization analysis the baseline scenario adopts the socioeconomic conditions in 2016 and the inflow conditions in 2010 qy 1 7 billion m3 yr which represents the hydrologic conditions of a normal year three types of scenarios are hypothesized first type a scenarios consider five different inflow conditions at yingluoxia i e qy keeping other conditions the same as those in the baseline scenario in scenarios a1 to a5 qy is assumed to be 1 3 1 5 1 7 1 9 and 2 1 billion m3 yr respectively which reflects the historical variation in qy note that scenario a3 is actually the baseline scenario type a scenarios essentially represent the regional climate variation because qy directly reflects the climate condition in the upstream mountainous area second type b scenarios assume different percentages of reduction in cropping area in zb in comparison with the baseline scenario i e scenario a3 the reduction percentages are 5 10 15 20 and 25 in scenarios b1 to b5 respectively to perform the multiobjective optimization for type b scenarios an additional constraint is needed r 1 r j 1 j t a r j 1 γ b a where ba is the total cropping area ha in the baseline scenario and γ is the reduction percentage note that the reduction percentages of the individual crops will vary with the bri of china liu and dunford 2016 inland china is anticipated to experience more infrastructure construction and faster urbanization which may lead to a reduction in cultivated land the type b scenarios adequately embody this anticipation third the type c scenario hypothesizes a new regime of water quality management in which the total nitrogen loading from agricultural nonpoint sources has to be reduced by 10 4 results and discussion 4 1 system efficiencies under different inflow conditions fig 4 presents the optimized crop areas and structures in scenarios a1 to a5 with increasing inflow the numbers on the right side of the bars are the total crop areas and the percentages inside the bars indicate the crop structures in all five scenarios maize is the dominant crop type followed by vegetable and wheat as expected an increase in inflow i e a wetter climate condition leads to an expansion of the crop area the total area in scenario a5 is approximately 32 greater than that in scenario a1 however the percentages of individual crops show varying trends the percentage of the wheat area first decreases from 7 2 in scenario a1 to 6 3 in scenario a3 but then increases to 7 5 in scenario a5 the percentage of maize shows a similar trend but the turning point is scenario a2 the percentage of vegetable area exhibits an opposite trend and the turning point is scenario a2 as well according to table 2 vegetable has the highest economic return and potential nitrogen loss among the three crop types thus when extra water becomes available to support cropland expansion vegetable production is favored first due to its economic return however when the climate condition becomes even wetter more wheat and maize areas should be considered to balance the ecological and environmental objectives fig 5 illustrates the optimized objective values in scenarios a1 to a5 all the objective values are standardized by the respective values of the actual conditions in 2016 in this figure the optimization results without the constraint of food security i e eq 10 are presented for comparison see the triangles in the subplots the figure shows that all three objectives vary nonlinearly with the inflow condition it also indicates that the economic and environmental efficiency objectives can be improved i e the standardized apiw is above 1 and the standardized tnap is below 1 by optimization with regard to the actual conditions in 2016 however the ecological efficiency objective is degraded i e the standardized efap is below 1 because the food crops i e wheat and maize have relatively high irrigation demands but relatively low economic returns refer to the parameter values in table 2 in comparison to vegetables irrigation demand increases faster than economic return if the area of food crops expands this finding explains the trend of apiw with the food security constraint in fig 5a and fig 4 shows that the increase in cropping area in scenario a2 is mainly caused by vegetables while the increases in scenarios a3 to a5 are mainly caused by maize similarly the trend of tnap is due to the relatively high pollution export of vegetables refer to the parameter values in table 2 interestingly efap monotonously decreases with inflow fig 5b which implies that the agricultural production in zb becomes less efficient at saving water for the ecosystems in the downstream area when more water is available the trend of efap monotonous change is different from those of apiw and tnap nonmonotonous changes because the ecological flow depends on not only the irrigation demand but also the inflow the trends of efap in fig 5b simply indicate that as the inflow increases the flow surplus i e the inflow minus the irrigation demand increases slower than the economic return this simulated trend coincides with the historical record the targets of ecological flow have been rarely met since the implementation of the water allocation plan see section 3 1 and the gap is even larger in wetter years wu et al 2016 this finding suggests that the optimization model in this study adequately represents the behavior of the socioeconomic system in zb fig 6 illustrates the effect of the food security constraint for food crops i e wheat and maize as reflected by the difference between the two curves in each subplot with the constraint apiw and tnap vary nonmonotonously with the inflow condition and reach their optimal conditions i e the highest apiw and the lowest tnap in scenario a2 the impact of the food security constraint on the system efficiencies is greatest in scenario a1 which represents a very dry condition an important implication is that in dry conditions food security is a limiting factor for the agricultural system to achieve desirable economic and environmental efficiencies different from fig 4 fig 6 further illustrates the optimized area of two food crops in the three counties under the five scenarios with and without the food security constraint applied the constraint of food security has a notable impact on the planting areas of the two food crops in scenarios a1 a3 dry conditions but no impact in scenarios a4 and a5 wet conditions with the constraint the optimized planting areas are at the area limits in most cases without the constraint the food crops are preferably planted in gaotai county gt and ganzhou county gc an important implication is that unless in an extremely dry condition e g scenario a1 the impact of the food security constraint on the system efficiencies can be largely offset by adjusting the spatial patterns of food crops overall from the nexus point of view fig 5 reveals the synergy effect between the economic efficiency apiw and the environmental efficiency efap of the agricultural system in zb as well as the tradeoff between these two efficiencies and the ecological efficiency tnap under the potential climate change fig 6 reflects the resilience of the agricultural system under potential water and food stresses 4 2 system efficiencies under land use conversion fig 7 shows the optimized crop structures in scenarios b1 to b5 i e low to high levels of land use change from farmlands to built up areas in contrast to the baseline scenario i e scenario a3 from scenario b1 to scenario b4 the areas of vegetable and wheat increase by 4 6 and 1 0 percentage points respectively and the area of maize decreases by 5 6 percentage points fig 8 illustrates the optimized objective values in scenarios b1 to b5 all the objective values are standardized by the respective values in the baseline scenario in general the three objectives improve i e increasing apiw and efap and decreasing tnap which implies that urbanization and industrialization can enhance the efficiencies of the agricultural system the trends illustrated by fig 8 can also be explained based on the optimized crop areas and structures in fig 7 when croplands are turned into fallow or modified for other uses the agricultural system in zb relies more on vegetable production fig 7 initially i e scenarios b1 and b4 to maintain its overall economic return which consequently enhances the economic return per unit irrigation water fig 8a meanwhile as the demand for irrigation water is reduced due to land conversion a higher portion of water becomes available as ecological flow which explains fig 8b fig 9 shows that the total agricultural profit tap decreases at a slower rate than the total nitrogen load tnl which explains fig 8c fig 8 shows that with the food security constraint the system efficiencies are reduced if the land use conversion is dramatic i e scenario b5 different from fig 7 fig 10 further illustrates the optimized areas of the two food crops in the three counties with and without the food security constraint applied in all the counties and the district the optimized planting area of wheat reaches the respective limits with the constraint but reduces to zero without the constraint fig 10a c and e however the planting area of maize has very different changing trends in the three counties and the district figs 10b d and f figs 8 and 10 indicate the resilience of the agricultural system under potential land and food stresses which arises from the flexibility to adjust the spatial pattern of maize planting in this region overall fig 8 illustrates the synergetic effect of the three efficiency objectives under the potential land use conversion however due to the constraint of food security some of the synergies turn into tradeoffs in cases in which the land use conversion is dramatic an important implication of such a wea nexus is that when maintained at an appropriate level urbanization and industrialization in northwest china can have a positive effect on both water conservation and pollution abatement in the agricultural system in this region 4 3 impact of water quality management note that the analysis in section 4 2 does not take into account the impact of urbanization and industrialization on water quality urbanization and industrialization may enhance the pressure of water pollution in the study region in which case abatement of agricultural nonpoint source pollution may be required thus the effects of managing the agricultural nonpoint source pollution on the complex nexus are further investigated in this study table 3 compares the optimization results in scenario c i e 10 reduction in nitrogen loading and the baseline scenario without the 10 reduction as shown the system can adapt to the hypothesized load control by reducing the areas of wheat and maize and keeping the area of vegetable almost unchanged in contrast to the baseline scenario in this case the total agricultural profit and total nitrogen load are both reduced but all three efficiency objectives are improved an important implication of table 3 is that imposing additional water quality measures may actually lead to cobenefits of the system efficiencies if the crop area and structure can be strategically adjusted based on a system analysis such as the molfp analysis in this study 4 4 comparison with the traditional approach to examine the effectiveness of the molfp approach in finding optimal solutions the approach is compared with the traditional weighted sum approach in the baseline scenario i e scenario a3 as table 4 shows the molfp approach produces better optimization results with regard to all three objectives and suggests a crop structure with less planting areas of wheat and maize this proves the effectiveness of the molfp approach an additional advantage of the molfp approach is that unlike the traditional weighted sum approach the approach requires no subjective judgment on the relative importance of different objectives 5 conclusions in this study a multiobjective linear fractional programming molfp approach is proposed to address the synergies and tradeoffs among agricultural production ecological conservation and water security in arid areas the approach represents a novel framework for planning an efficient agricultural system under varying climate land and regulation conditions as well as an effective way of dealing with water ecosystem agriculture wea nexus problems where system efficiencies are concerned the molfp approach is applied to zhangye basin zb a typical arid region with extensive agriculture in northwestern china to investigate how the changes in the hydrological conditions land use and water management regime impact the wea nexus in zb the varying system efficiencies under different conditions clearly reflect the complexity of the wea nexus in zb the major findings of this study are as follows first it has been demonstrated that the molfp approach can effectively identify solutions for the optimization problems in this study which focus on multiple interrelated system efficiencies of ratio type objectives and the optimization results intrinsically reflect the behavior of the socioeconomic system in zb second under climate change there is synergy between the economic efficiency i e the agricultural profit per unit of irrigation water and the environmental efficiency i e the agricultural nonpoint source loading of tn per unit of agricultural profit of the agricultural system in zb but tradeoffs between these two efficiencies and the ecological efficiency i e the ecological flow to the lower hrb i e qz per unit of agricultural profit in wet conditions the economic and environmental efficiencies can be improved simultaneously but the ecological efficiency is degraded i e the agricultural system becomes less efficient in saving water for the ecosystems in the downstream area third the potential land use conversion of croplands into fallow or built up areas as well as the new water quality regulation can lead to cobenefits of the economic ecological and environmental efficiencies if the agricultural system can strategically adjust its crop structure a system analysis such as the molfp analysis in this study is highly desired to inform the adjustment finally with regard to the system efficiencies the flexibility to adjust the spatial pattern of crop planting makes the agricultural system in zb exhibit good resilience to water land and food stresses however the resilience is seriously impaired under extreme dry conditions and dramatic land use changes overall this study develops a new framework for addressing the complex nexus of water ecosystems and agriculture in arid areas through system modeling the study results provide insights into agriculture planning and water resources management in such areas future studies may expand the system model to incorporate more processes for example when analyzing the impact of the land use conversion on water quality only nitrogen loading from croplands is considered in fact urbanization and industrialization associated with the conversion may induce new sources of nitrogen and add extra risks of water pollution technological advances and market variation may also change the parameter values provided in table 2 acknowledgments this work was supported by the strategic priority

10913,in arid areas agricultural development can occur at the expense of ecosystem conservation and water quality to balance the conflicting interests the water ecosystem agriculture wea nexus in such areas needs to be systematically addressed in this study a multi objective linear fractional programming molfp approach is proposed to model the synergies and tradeoffs in the wea nexus using this approach the impacts of changes in hydrological conditions land use and the water management regime on the economic ecological and environmental efficiencies of the agricultural system in zhangye basin zb a typical arid area in northwestern china were assessed the major study findings are as follows first the molfp approach can effectively identify solutions for optimization problems with multiple interrelated ratio type objectives and the optimization results intrinsically reflect the behavior of the socioeconomic system second in wet conditions the agricultural system can be more profitable and environmentally friendly but less efficient in saving water for the ecosystems in the downstream area third the potential land use conversion from croplands into fallow or built up areas as well as the new water quality regulation may lead to co benefits of economic ecological and environmental efficiencies finally the flexibility to adjust the spatial pattern of crop planting makes the agricultural system in zb exhibit good resilience to water land and food stresses however the resilience is seriously impaired under very dry conditions and dramatic land use changes overall this study lays out a new framework for addressing the complex wea nexus through system modeling and provides insights into agriculture planning and water resources management in arid areas keywords water ecosystem agriculture nexus food security ecological flow nonpoint source pollution multiobjective optimization fractional programming 1 introduction agricultural development is inextricably linked with land use change water and energy consumption and nonpoint source pollution in many cases decisions on agricultural development are made without considering cross sectoral interactions e g interactions among crop production socioeconomic development and water and land conservation and externalities such as water pollution finley and seiber 2014 vora et al 2017 this single minded approach to decision making may yield suboptimal solutions leading to unintended and detrimental consequences especially when the economic objective conflicts with environmental ecological or social objectives bhaduri et al 2015 david et al 2015 with the aim of addressing sustainable development goals sdgs a shift from the sole goal of economic maximization to a multiobjective evaluation is necessary weitz et al 2014 recently the human nature nexus framework has been adopted to better anticipate otherwise unforeseen consequences evaluate tradeoffs produce cobenefits and allow competing interests to seek a common ground and cooptimization liu et al 2015 complex nexuses centered on water such as the food energy water few nexus represent a new paradigm that allows interdisciplinary research to progress and study outcomes to be implemented in real world management cai et al 2018 in this paradigm a system modeling approach can be implemented to quantitatively address cross sectoral synergies and tradeoffs and to support integrated management endo et al 2015 hurford and harou 2014 however the appropriate incorporation of human and institutional behaviors in the system model needs further studies in arid and semiarid regions a typical water ecosystem agriculture wea nexus exists as conceptualized in fig 1 agriculture is often a main industry in such areas and production of food and economic crops is critical to socioeconomic development of the local communities through land use changes irrigation and application of fertilizers and pesticides agriculture can substantially modify the hydrological cycle in terms of both water quality and quantity gordon et al 2010 depletion of both surface and subsurface water resources by irrigation often leads to degradation of vegetation and loss of wetlands e g riparian zones and terminal lakes of inland rivers falkenmark and lannerstad 2005 finlayson and d cruz 2005 these ecological consequences will in turn jeopardize sustainability of the agriculture this typical nexus represents an enormous challenge to balance economic ecological and environmental interests in the planning and management of agricultural water cai et al 2018 niu et al 2016 decisions based on sound science are highly desired to reflect conflicting interests multiobjective programming mop has been widely implemented for example maino et al 1993 applied a multiobjective mathematical model to aid in understanding the structure and function of farming systems and in evaluating the potential impact of different technological and rural development activities raju and kumar 1999 developed a model to optimize the irrigation plan of the sri ram sagar project andhra pradesh india taking into account net benefits and labor employment xevi and khan 2005 addressed optimal crop pattern and water management by considering three objective functions maximizing net returns minimizing variable cost and minimizing groundwater pumping georgiou and papamichail 2008 integrated a nonlinear programming optimization model with a soil water balance calculation and investigated the optimal reservoir release policies irrigation allocation to multiple crops and optimal cropping pattern zheng et al 2013 solved a mop problem for oil crop fertilization in which crop yield and quality energy consumption and environmental effects were considered however few studies simultaneously considered economic benefit water pollution and ecological flow within the context of agricultural development in arid and semiarid regions in previous mop studies on agricultural systems different methods were used to select satisfactory nondominant solutions such as weighting methods marler and arora 2010 e constrained approaches yokoyama et al 1988 goal programming pal et al 2003 and fuzzy programming methods li et al 2014 in real world management decisions for problems may inherently rely on ratios between individual objectives chakraborty and gupta 2002 for example in water limited areas agricultural profit per unit of irrigation water apiw is a critical measure of the system performance cai et al 2003 and combines two individual objective variables economic profit i e the benefit and water consumption i e the cost the above classic methods may inappropriately handle integrating objectives with fractional forms fractional programming fp is an effective mathematical programming approach for solving ratio optimization problems charnes et al 1978 stancu minasian 2012 during the last decade fp has been applied in different disciplines such as financial analysis toksarı 2008 power generation planning chen et al 2015 aggregate production planning wang and liang 2004 and others castrodeza et al 2005 leber et al 2005 veeramani and sumathi 2016 the advantages of fp over classic methods for multiobjective ratio optimization problems have been well demonstrated for example zhu et al 2014 applied fp to solve an energy system planning problem and the optimization generates flexible schemes of resource allocations and facility expansions towards sustainable energy management zappone and jorswieck 2015 proposed a framework of energy efficiency maximization based on fp and successfully applied it in practical wireless networks shen and yu 2018 used fp in the design and optimization of communication systems i e power control beamforming and energy efficiency maximization multiobjective linear fractional programming molfp integrates fp with mop and is able to address multiple objectives in fractional formulas de and deb 2015 in our literature survey this approach has rarely been applied in the agricultural field and its potential to address complex nexus issues has not been explored the present study develops a molfp model for optimizing crop structure and its associated irrigation water demands in the context of a wea nexus the molfp model is then applied to a case study in zhangye basin zb a typical semiarid to arid area in northwestern china zb is the midstream section of the heihe river basin hrb the second largest inland river basin in china the irrigated farmlands in zb consume a large amount of river flow and groundwater wu et al 2014 which has caused serious environmental problems in the lower hrb such as desertification ji et al 2006 salinization wen et al 2005 and shrinkage of the terminal lake i e east juyan lake guo et al 2009 in addition agricultural development has increased the risk of nonpoint pollution e g nutrients and pesticides in zb the wea nexus in zb is typical of the vast inland areas in china chen et al 2003 ma et al 2005 as well as in other parts of the world such as central asia cretaux et al 2013 varis 2014 the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to develop a molfp approach to modeling the synergies and tradeoffs among agricultural production ecological conservation and water security in arid areas from a system efficiency perspective 2 to simulate the response of the wea nexus in zb to varying hydrologic conditions in relation to potential climate change land use changes induced by potential socioeconomic shifts and water quality regulation and 3 to investigate the resilience of the agricultural system in zb under water land and food stresses overall the study results can provide insights into agriculture planning and water resources management in arid areas with extensive agricultural development 2 multiobjective linear fractional programming molfp molfp addresses optimization problems with multiple ratio objectives that are conflicting or noncommensurable in this study a newly proposed solution is employed to solve molfp problems the solution is based on the theorem by dinkelbach dinkelbach 1967 and the approach by güzel güzel 2013 a molfp problem can be mathematically expressed as described by chakraborty and gupta 2002 1a m a x i m i z e f 1 n 1 x d 1 x f 2 n 2 x d 2 x f k n k x d k x 1b subject to a x b 1c x 0 where x r n 1 a r m n b r m 1 and n i x c i t x α i d i x d i t x β i for all i 1 2 k c i t d i t r 1 n α i β i r and d i x 0 for all i 1 2 k the solution for the molfp problem in equation 1 is a nonempty and bounded set and each of the objective functions is continuously differentiable for each objective in the molfp problem max f n x d x a x b a n d x 0 where f represents a function form dinkelbach dinkelbach 1967 suggested that f n x d x would be an optimal solution if and only if z x f m a x z n x f d x a x b a n d x 0 0 where x is the global maximum point and f is the respective value of the objective function the fractional programming problem can be solved in a finite number of iterations as follows 1 transform the objective function f n x d x to a nonfractional function z n x q d x with parameter q appropriately initialized 2 obtain the values of x 1 and f 1 by the simplex algorithm brearley et al 1975 and then calculate z 1 where the superscript indicates the iteration number 3 if z 1 approximates zero i e less than 0 001 the iteration process for solving the single linear fraction problem is ended and the objective function f equals q 4 otherwise the initial value of q is updated to q n x 1 d x 1 and 5 repeat these steps until z approximates zero thereby obtaining the global optimal point x and the f value different approaches have been proposed to solve molfp problems charnes and cooper 1962 solved a molfp problem by transforming it into two linear programming problems chakraborty and gupta 2002 explored a procedure to solve molfp problems using a fuzzy set theoretical approach based on suitably defined membership functions and using a min operator as the aggregator pal et al 2003 investigated a linearization process of solving fuzzy molfp problems via a minsum goal programming procedure pramanik et al 2011 and toksarı 2008 used the taylor series to transform a molfp problem to a normal multiobjective linear programming problem recently güzel 2013 proposed a new solution to molfp according to güzel 2013 a feasible solution x is an efficient solution if it is an optimal solution to the problem m a x i m i z e i 1 k n i x g i d i x a x b and x 0 where g i n i x i d i x i for all i and x i represents the global optima of the individual maximization problems max f i n i x d i x a x b and x 0 thus the molfp problem can be reduced to a single objective nonfractional linear programming problem bhati and singh 2017 2a m a x i m i z e z i i 1 k n i x g i d i x 2b subject to a x b 2c x 0 this solution can be easily programmed using existing tools such as lingo and matlab this new approach has been successful applied to solve a tri objective linear programming problem for generation expansion planning chen et al 2015 and is adopted by this study in summary the solution approach for the multiobjective linear programming model consists of the following steps 1 for each objective function in the multiobjective linear fractional programming model obtain the optimal solution and respective objective value based on the dinkelbach approach 2 convert the multiobjective linear fractional programming model into a single objective linear programming model using güzel s approach 3 solve the single objective linear programming model to obtain a solution to the original multiobjective linear programming model and 4 stop 3 data and methods 3 1 study area the zhangye basin zb in gansu province china is chosen as the study area fig 2 zb is in the midstream part of the heihe river basin hrb the second largest inland river basin in china zb is a typical semiarid to arid inland area the total area of zb is approximately 36 551 km2 the elevation increases from 1290 m in the northwest to 2200 m in the southeast the annual rainfall is approximately 190 mm which occurs mainly from june to september and the annual potential evapotranspiration et is approximately 1325 mm wu et al 2014 the main heihe river brings approximately 1 72 billion m3 yr of streamflow from the qilian mountains on the northern margin of the qinghai tibetan plateau to zb through yingluoxia the agriculture in zb consumes a large share of the streamflow wu et al 2015 due to the rapid increase in irrigation water consumption in zb the river discharge through zhengyixia experienced a significant decrease in the 1990s leading to serious ecological problems e g drying up of the terminal lakes and death of culturally significant populus euphratica forests in the lower hrb chen et al 2005 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 these problems were not alleviated until the central government started to restrict the streamflow diversion in 2000 however the diversion restriction has stimulated groundwater pumping in zb which has not been well regulated as a result the groundwater storage in zb has been declining recently which poses potential environmental and ecological risks to the zb tian et al 2015 zb is located within the administrative boundary of zhangye city and mainly covers three subareas of the city ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county see fig 2 these three subareas have the most productive farmlands in the basin which are all fed by the main heihe river maize wheat and vegetables are the main types of crops in zb the structural percentage of the main crops and other cultivated crops are presented in table 1 as of 2016 the aggregated agricultural benefit of zhangye city was approximately 102 42 billion rmb yuan approximately 1 49 billion accounting for 25 61 of the city s gdp gssy 2016 as conceptualized in fig 3 the water ecosystem agriculture wea nexus in this area is complex before 2000 the intensive agricultural irrigation in zb had dramatically decreased the river flow towards the downstream region of hrb and had caused serious ecological problems such as shrinkage of the terminal lake death of populus euphratica and increased frequency of sandstorms cheng et al 2014 since 2000 a water allocation plan has been strictly enforced by the central government in zb and specifies that the streamflow volume through zhengyixia should be secured under different hydrologic conditions in a normal year i e 1 58 billion m3 inflow at yingluoxia for example the outflow from zhengyixia should be no less than 0 95 billion m3 while the allocation plan has resulted in recovery of the downstream ecosystems the agriculture mainly for food production keeps expanding and more groundwater is exploited in zb posing a risk to the sustainability of the groundwater resources and wetland ecosystems in zb in addition agricultural development may introduce the risk of nonpoint source pollution due to the increasing use of fertilizers and pesticides the complex wea nexus greatly challenges the regional decision makers who have to balance food water and ecological securities in this undeveloped and environmentally sensitive area the nexus may also evolve rapidly through time one important driving force may be climate change or climate variation the conflict among the food water and ecological sectors is largely conditional on the inflow from the upstream mountainous area recently the conflict has been relatively mild partially due to the wet conditions in the upstream areas however whether the wet conditions reflect a tendency of climate change or just a part of the normal dry wet cycle is unclear the decision makers have to be prepared for potential droughts another important driving force may be urbanization with the belt and road initiative bri of china liu and dunford 2016 inland china is anticipated to have more infrastructure construction and faster urbanization which may lead to a reduction in cultivated land zb sits on a vital passageway of the ancient silk road and is currently an important part of the silk road economic belt the belt third a change in the water management regime may also impact the nexus at present the availability of water resources is the focus of water management in zb however as the population grows and urbanization and industrialization proceed water quality problems may become relevant soon and water management may have to incorporate measures for pollution prevention and control as fig 3 illustrates this study performs system modeling for the wea nexus and investigates how the agricultural system will evolve under potential climatic and socioeconomic variations the molfp approach is adopted for the system model considering economic ecological and environmental objectives the optimization represents a planning procedure by which appropriate crop areas and structures are determined to cope with the variations the optimization results intrinsically reflect the behavior of the socioeconomic system in zb the molfp model will be introduced in detail later see section 3 3 the molfp model also incorporates a key relationship in the wea nexus derived based on an integrated hydrological model see section 3 2 3 2 a key relationship in the wea nexus to investigate the wea nexus a quantitative description of the water system in zb is necessary our previous studies have built an integrated hydrological model for zb wu et al 2014 2016 using gsflow coupled ground water and surface water flow model markstrom et al 2008 the gsflow model provides spatially and temporally detailed simulations of the regional water cycle but involving such a complex model in an optimization study is computationally difficult wu et al 2016 established a multiple linear regression model to quantify the relationship among the upstream inflow through yingluoxia qy the total irrigation water in zb d the outflow towards the downstream through zhengyixia qz and the groundwater storage change in zb δs based on the gsflow simulations under a number of different scenarios the regression model is as follows 3 δ s β 0 β 1 d β 2 q y β 3 q z ε where all β s are the regression coefficients and ε is a gaussian error term in our previous study wu et al 2016 the regression coefficients were estimated as β ˆ 0 0 2840 β ˆ 1 0 6312 β ˆ 2 0 8270 and β ˆ 3 0 5542 with the coefficient of determination r 2 being 0 9030 in the optimization analyses of this study this multiple linear regression model is used as the surrogate model of the original gsflow model 3 3 molfp model this study develops a molfp model to optimize the crop area and structure while simultaneously considering economic ecological and environmental objectives focusing on investigating the system efficiencies in these three aspects three ratio type objectives are formulated the decision variables are the planting areas of different crops in ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county a number of constraints associated with water and land availabilities crop nutrient balance and soil erosion in farmlands are incorporated all the calculations are on an annual average basis the objectives and constraints are introduced in the details below 1 three ratio type objectives the economic objective this objective is to maximize the agricultural profit per unit of irrigation water hereafter denoted as apiw in zb which factors in the revenue and major costs of the crop production this objective reflects the economic efficiency of the irrigation system in zb and is actually the productivity of irrigation water it can be expressed as follows 4 maximize a p i w r 1 r j 1 j y c r j p c r t a r j r 1 r j 1 j c a r t a r j c f r 1 r j 1 j h j t a r j c m r 1 r j 1 j f j t a r j r 1 r j 1 j i q r j t a r j where r indicates the primary crop types with r 1 2 and 3 representing wheat vegetable and maize respectively j is the subarea id with j 1 to 3 representing gaotai county linze county and ganzhou district respectively ycrj is the yield of crop r in subarea j kg ha pcr is the market price of crop r kg which is exogenous because the local production would not have a significant influence on the market price tarj is the total area of crop r in subarea j ha i e the decision variables carj is the total farming cost for crop r in subarea j which covers seed irrigation and labor expenses ha cm is the cost of compound fertilizer application t cf is the cost of nitrogenous fertilizer application t and cf and cm were referenced from the data by zhang et al 2009 and zhang et al 2014 hj is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer per unit area applied in subarea j t ha fj is the amount of compound fertilizer per unit area applied in subarea j t ha and h j and f j were obtained from gssy 2016 and iqrj is the irrigation quota i e the annual irrigation demand for crop r in subarea j m3 ha the irrigation quota is a gross requirement that is back calculated by dividing the net irrigation requirement by the irrigation efficiency the information of the net irrigation requirement and irrigation efficiency was obtained from the water resources bureau of zhangye city note that the us dollar is used as the currency and the average exchange rate in 2017 is referenced here the ecological objective this objective is to maximize the ecological flow to the lower hrb i e qz per unit of agricultural profit hereafter denoted as efap this objective reflects the water saving efficiency of agricultural production in zb by incorporating the key relationship i e eq 3 introduced in section 3 2 the objective can be written as 5 maximize e f a p δ s β ˆ 0 β ˆ 1 d β ˆ 2 q y β ˆ 3 r 1 r j 1 j y c r j p c r t a r j r 1 r j 1 j c a r t a r j c f r 1 r j 1 j h j t a r j c m r 1 r j 1 j f j t a r j the environmental objective as a major agricultural nonpoint source pollutant total nitrogen tn is considered as the target of water quality management the third objective is therefore to minimize the agricultural nonpoint source loading of tn per unit of agricultural profit hereafter denoted as tnap as follows 6 minimize t n a p r 1 r j 1 j m p r t a r j r 1 r j 1 j y c r j p c r t a r j r 1 r j 1 j c a r t a r j c f r 1 r j 1 j h j t a r j c m r 1 r j 1 j f j t a r j where mpr is the annual export coefficient of tn pollutants for agricultural arable land kg ha in the study area which adopts the values reported by li and zhuang 2003 this objective reflects the fertilizer use efficiency of agriculture production in zb 2 constraints the constraint of water availability as mentioned before streamflow diversion in the midstream area is limited by the water allocation regulation such that a certain amount of ecological flow can be secured for the downstream area in addition because the regulation has prompted groundwater exploitation and has therefore triggered a decline in groundwater storage groundwater pumping is currently regulated in parts of the study area to reflect the management background the following constraint is considered 7 r 1 r j 1 j i q r j t a r j s w g w sw in this constraint represents the amount of streamflow in the main heihe river that is diverted to the farmlands in the three administrative areas according to the historical data from 2000 to 2012 a polynomial relationship between sw and qy i e the inflow from the mountainous area through yingluoxia was determined as s w 0 023 q y 2 1 333 q y 5 473 r 2 0 971 gw in this constraint represents the average amount of allowed groundwater pumping the actual average amount from 2000 to 2012 considered here is 0 59 billion m3 yr eq 7 assumes that the exploitation of water resources for irrigation is not allowed to exceed the historical level between 2000 and 2012 the constraint of crop nutrient balance following zhang et al 2009 nitrogen balance is considered to constrain the optimization as follows 8 r 1 r j 1 j 1 p 1 n m f j t a r j r 1 r j 1 j 1 p 2 h j t a r j r 1 r j 1 j n r r t a r j where p1 is the nitrogen volatilization denitrification annual rate of compound fertilizer p2 is the nitrogen volatilization denitrification annual rate of nitrogenous fertilizer nm is the nitrogen content of compound fertilizer nrr is the nitrogen demand of crop r kg n ha and all other variables have been previously defined the constraint of soil erosion crop cultivation can change the degree of soil erosion this optimization study assumes that the total amount of soil eroded from the farmlands should not exceed a certain level 9 r 1 r j 1 j s l r t a r j m a j 1 j k j where ma is the maximum allowed rate of soil loss kg ha in the three administrative areas slr is the soil loss from the total cultivation area of crop r kg ha and kj is the maximum tillable land in subarea j ha the constraint of food security food security is the number 1 mission of china s agricultural development zb is one of the food production bases in northwest china and the cultivation of food crops in zb is important to regional food security naturally a considerable portion of the cultivated lands must be reserved for food production the following constraint is proposed to reflect this concern of food security 10 t a 1 j t a 1 j 0 1 α t a 3 j t a 3 j 0 1 α j where t a 1 j 0 and t a 3 j 0 are the cultivation areas of wheat and maize respectively in 2016 ha and α is the acceptable maximum reduction ratio with regard to the conditions in 2016 which is set to be 30 in this study the reduced cultivation area could be turned into fallow or built up areas the constraint of land availability the total cultivation area in each subarea must be less than the maximum tillable land in that subarea 11 r 1 r t a r j k j j the nonnegativity constraint all the decision variables must be nonnegative that is 12 t a r j 0 r j following güzel s approach see section 2 the above tri objective linear programming model can be converted into the following single objective linear programming model 13 maximization a p i w e f a p t n a p maximization a p i w n g 1 a p i w d e f a p n g 2 e f a p d t n a p n g 3 t n a p d where g 1 g 2 and g 3 represent the global maximum values of the three objective functions apiw efap and tnap respectively the subscripts n and d indicate the numerator and denominator respectively of the objective function these maximum values need to be determined separately first subject to the constraints introduced above to appropriately parameterize the molfp model data were collected from various sources including the literature statistical yearbooks and reports by the local government table 2 presents the parameter values and their references 3 4 solution of the traditional weighted sum approach to examine the effectiveness of the molfp approach in finding optimal solutions a traditional weighted sum approach marler and arora 2010 is applied in parallel and it is compared against the proposed approach in the baseline scenario the objective function in the traditional approach is 14 m ax i m i z a t i o n λ 1 a p i w a p i w λ 2 e f a p e f a p λ 3 t n a p t n a p where apiw efap and tnap represent the global maximum maximum and minimum values of the individual optimization problems maximize apiw maximize efap and minimize tnap respectively and are subject to the

eventually set to 0 4 0 4 and 0 2 respectively in this study 3 5 climate and socioeconomic scenarios this study investigates potential changes in the wea nexus under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios from a planning perspective i e based on the optimization analysis the baseline scenario adopts the socioeconomic conditions in 2016 and the inflow conditions in 2010 qy 1 7 billion m3 yr which represents the hydrologic conditions of a normal year three types of scenarios are hypothesized first type a scenarios consider five different inflow conditions at yingluoxia i e qy keeping other conditions the same as those in the baseline scenario in scenarios a1 to a5 qy is assumed to be 1 3 1 5 1 7 1 9 and 2 1 billion m3 yr respectively which reflects the historical variation in qy note that scenario a3 is actually the baseline scenario type a scenarios essentially represent the regional climate variation because qy directly reflects the climate condition in the upstream mountainous area second type b scenarios assume different percentages of reduction in cropping area in zb in comparison with the baseline scenario i e scenario a3 the reduction percentages are 5 10 15 20 and 25 in scenarios b1 to b5 respectively to perform the multiobjective optimization for type b scenarios an additional constraint is needed r 1 r j 1 j t a r j 1 γ b a where ba is the total cropping area ha in the baseline scenario and γ is the reduction percentage note that the reduction percentages of the individual crops will vary with the bri of china liu and dunford 2016 inland china is anticipated to experience more infrastructure construction and faster urbanization which may lead to a reduction in cultivated land the type b scenarios adequately embody this anticipation third the type c scenario hypothesizes a new regime of water quality management in which the total nitrogen loading from agricultural nonpoint sources has to be reduced by 10 4 results and discussion 4 1 system efficiencies under different inflow conditions fig 4 presents the optimized crop areas and structures in scenarios a1 to a5 with increasing inflow the numbers on the right side of the bars are the total crop areas and the percentages inside the bars indicate the crop structures in all five scenarios maize is the dominant crop type followed by vegetable and wheat as expected an increase in inflow i e a wetter climate condition leads to an expansion of the crop area the total area in scenario a5 is approximately 32 greater than that in scenario a1 however the percentages of individual crops show varying trends the percentage of the wheat area first decreases from 7 2 in scenario a1 to 6 3 in scenario a3 but then increases to 7 5 in scenario a5 the percentage of maize shows a similar trend but the turning point is scenario a2 the percentage of vegetable area exhibits an opposite trend and the turning point is scenario a2 as well according to table 2 vegetable has the highest economic return and potential nitrogen loss among the three crop types thus when extra water becomes available to support cropland expansion vegetable production is favored first due to its economic return however when the climate condition becomes even wetter more wheat and maize areas should be considered to balance the ecological and environmental objectives fig 5 illustrates the optimized objective values in scenarios a1 to a5 all the objective values are standardized by the respective values of the actual conditions in 2016 in this figure the optimization results without the constraint of food security i e eq 10 are presented for comparison see the triangles in the subplots the figure shows that all three objectives vary nonlinearly with the inflow condition it also indicates that the economic and environmental efficiency objectives can be improved i e the standardized apiw is above 1 and the standardized tnap is below 1 by optimization with regard to the actual conditions in 2016 however the ecological efficiency objective is degraded i e the standardized efap is below 1 because the food crops i e wheat and maize have relatively high irrigation demands but relatively low economic returns refer to the parameter values in table 2 in comparison to vegetables irrigation demand increases faster than economic return if the area of food crops expands this finding explains the trend of apiw with the food security constraint in fig 5a and fig 4 shows that the increase in cropping area in scenario a2 is mainly caused by vegetables while the increases in scenarios a3 to a5 are mainly caused by maize similarly the trend of tnap is due to the relatively high pollution export of vegetables refer to the parameter values in table 2 interestingly efap monotonously decreases with inflow fig 5b which implies that the agricultural production in zb becomes less efficient at saving water for the ecosystems in the downstream area when more water is available the trend of efap monotonous change is different from those of apiw and tnap nonmonotonous changes because the ecological flow depends on not only the irrigation demand but also the inflow the trends of efap in fig 5b simply indicate that as the inflow increases the flow surplus i e the inflow minus the irrigation demand increases slower than the economic return this simulated trend coincides with the historical record the targets of ecological flow have been rarely met since the implementation of the water allocation plan see section 3 1 and the gap is even larger in wetter years wu et al 2016 this finding suggests that the optimization model in this study adequately represents the behavior of the socioeconomic system in zb fig 6 illustrates the effect of the food security constraint for food crops i e wheat and maize as reflected by the difference between the two curves in each subplot with the constraint apiw and tnap vary nonmonotonously with the inflow condition and reach their optimal conditions i e the highest apiw and the lowest tnap in scenario a2 the impact of the food security constraint on the system efficiencies is greatest in scenario a1 which represents a very dry condition an important implication is that in dry conditions food security is a limiting factor for the agricultural system to achieve desirable economic and environmental efficiencies different from fig 4 fig 6 further illustrates the optimized area of two food crops in the three counties under the five scenarios with and without the food security constraint applied the constraint of food security has a notable impact on the planting areas of the two food crops in scenarios a1 a3 dry conditions but no impact in scenarios a4 and a5 wet conditions with the constraint the optimized planting areas are at the area limits in most cases without the constraint the food crops are preferably planted in gaotai county gt and ganzhou county gc an important implication is that unless in an extremely dry condition e g scenario a1 the impact of the food security constraint on the system efficiencies can be largely offset by adjusting the spatial patterns of food crops overall from the nexus point of view fig 5 reveals the synergy effect between the economic efficiency apiw and the environmental efficiency efap of the agricultural system in zb as well as the tradeoff between these two efficiencies and the ecological efficiency tnap under the potential climate change fig 6 reflects the resilience of the agricultural system under potential water and food stresses 4 2 system efficiencies under land use conversion fig 7 shows the optimized crop structures in scenarios b1 to b5 i e low to high levels of land use change from farmlands to built up areas in contrast to the baseline scenario i e scenario a3 from scenario b1 to scenario b4 the areas of vegetable and wheat increase by 4 6 and 1 0 percentage points respectively and the area of maize decreases by 5 6 percentage points fig 8 illustrates the optimized objective values in scenarios b1 to b5 all the objective values are standardized by the respective values in the baseline scenario in general the three objectives improve i e increasing apiw and efap and decreasing tnap which implies that urbanization and industrialization can enhance the efficiencies of the agricultural system the trends illustrated by fig 8 can also be explained based on the optimized crop areas and structures in fig 7 when croplands are turned into fallow or modified for other uses the agricultural system in zb relies more on vegetable production fig 7 initially i e scenarios b1 and b4 to maintain its overall economic return which consequently enhances the economic return per unit irrigation water fig 8a meanwhile as the demand for irrigation water is reduced due to land conversion a higher portion of water becomes available as ecological flow which explains fig 8b fig 9 shows that the total agricultural profit tap decreases at a slower rate than the total nitrogen load tnl which explains fig 8c fig 8 shows that with the food security constraint the system efficiencies are reduced if the land use conversion is dramatic i e scenario b5 different from fig 7 fig 10 further illustrates the optimized areas of the two food crops in the three counties with and without the food security constraint applied in all the counties and the district the optimized planting area of wheat reaches the respective limits with the constraint but reduces to zero without the constraint fig 10a c and e however the planting area of maize has very different changing trends in the three counties and the district figs 10b d and f figs 8 and 10 indicate the resilience of the agricultural system under potential land and food stresses which arises from the flexibility to adjust the spatial pattern of maize planting in this region overall fig 8 illustrates the synergetic effect of the three efficiency objectives under the potential land use conversion however due to the constraint of food security some of the synergies turn into tradeoffs in cases in which the land use conversion is dramatic an important implication of such a wea nexus is that when maintained at an appropriate level urbanization and industrialization in northwest china can have a positive effect on both water conservation and pollution abatement in the agricultural system in this region 4 3 impact of water quality management note that the analysis in section 4 2 does not take into account the impact of urbanization and industrialization on water quality urbanization and industrialization may enhance the pressure of water pollution in the study region in which case abatement of agricultural nonpoint source pollution may be required thus the effects of managing the agricultural nonpoint source pollution on the complex nexus are further investigated in this study table 3 compares the optimization results in scenario c i e 10 reduction in nitrogen loading and the baseline scenario without the 10 reduction as shown the system can adapt to the hypothesized load control by reducing the areas of wheat and maize and keeping the area of vegetable almost unchanged in contrast to the baseline scenario in this case the total agricultural profit and total nitrogen load are both reduced but all three efficiency objectives are improved an important implication of table 3 is that imposing additional water quality measures may actually lead to cobenefits of the system efficiencies if the crop area and structure can be strategically adjusted based on a system analysis such as the molfp analysis in this study 4 4 comparison with the traditional approach to examine the effectiveness of the molfp approach in finding optimal solutions the approach is compared with the traditional weighted sum approach in the baseline scenario i e scenario a3 as table 4 shows the molfp approach produces better optimization results with regard to all three objectives and suggests a crop structure with less planting areas of wheat and maize this proves the effectiveness of the molfp approach an additional advantage of the molfp approach is that unlike the traditional weighted sum approach the approach requires no subjective judgment on the relative importance of different objectives 5 conclusions in this study a multiobjective linear fractional programming molfp approach is proposed to address the synergies and tradeoffs among agricultural production ecological conservation and water security in arid areas the approach represents a novel framework for planning an efficient agricultural system under varying climate land and regulation conditions as well as an effective way of dealing with water ecosystem agriculture wea nexus problems where system efficiencies are concerned the molfp approach is applied to zhangye basin zb a typical arid region with extensive agriculture in northwestern china to investigate how the changes in the hydrological conditions land use and water management regime impact the wea nexus in zb the varying system efficiencies under different conditions clearly reflect the complexity of the wea nexus in zb the major findings of this study are as follows first it has been demonstrated that the molfp approach can effectively identify solutions for the optimization problems in this study which focus on multiple interrelated system efficiencies of ratio type objectives and the optimization results intrinsically reflect the behavior of the socioeconomic system in zb second under climate change there is synergy between the economic efficiency i e the agricultural profit per unit of irrigation water and the environmental efficiency i e the agricultural nonpoint source loading of tn per unit of agricultural profit of the agricultural system in zb but tradeoffs between these two efficiencies and the ecological efficiency i e the ecological flow to the lower hrb i e qz per unit of agricultural profit in wet conditions the economic and environmental efficiencies can be improved simultaneously but the ecological efficiency is degraded i e the agricultural system becomes less efficient in saving water for the ecosystems in the downstream area third the potential land use conversion of croplands into fallow or built up areas as well as the new water quality regulation can lead to cobenefits of the economic ecological and environmental efficiencies if the agricultural system can strategically adjust its crop structure a system analysis such as the molfp analysis in this study is highly desired to inform the adjustment finally with regard to the system efficiencies the flexibility to adjust the spatial pattern of crop planting makes the agricultural system in zb exhibit good resilience to water land and food stresses however the resilience is seriously impaired under extreme dry conditions and dramatic land use changes overall this study develops a new framework for addressing the complex nexus of water ecosystems and agriculture in arid areas through system modeling the study results provide insights into agriculture planning and water resources management in such areas future studies may expand the system model to incorporate more processes for example when analyzing the impact of the land use conversion on water quality only nitrogen loading from croplands is considered in fact urbanization and industrialization associated with the conversion may induce new sources of nitrogen and add extra risks of water pollution technological advances and market variation may also change the parameter values provided in table 2 acknowledgments this work was supported by the strategic priority

10914,soybean glycine max is a commercially important oilseed crop across the world it is also popularly used as vegetables cookery and fodder crops in japan in areas with limited rainfall and high temperature mulching can provide greater yield of rain fed soybean by improving soil hydro thermal regimes however organic mulching like rice straw and shaded newspaper being inexpensive rapidly degradable easy to use and environment friendly may provide more benefits than plastic mulching field experiments with rain fed soybean cultivation were done in 2015 and 2016 at gifu university farm in japan the purposes were to investigate the effects of rice straw and newspaper mulching on moisture and temperature regimes of soil soil water consumption swc soil moisture extraction pattern smep total readily available moisture tram water use efficiency wue as well as growth and yield of soybean mulching increased seasonal soil moisture content with lesser fluctuations in the root zone compared to bare soil and lowered soil temperature by 2 c at 5 cm and 0 5 1 0 c at 15 25 cm soil depths straw mulch reduced swc by 41 8 and 13 9 in 2015 and 2016 respectively compared to bare soil the corresponding reduction in swc under newspaper mulch was 16 6 and 20 6 consequently mulching improved wue by 25 47 compared to bare soil mulching significantly p 0 05 improved plant height leaf

newspaper mulching compared to bare soil newspaper mulch provided higher yield and wue by maintaining lower soil temperature and swc and greater soil moisture compared to straw mulch thus newspaper can be an alternative option to rice straw mulch for improving soil hydro thermal regimes for rain fed soybean cultivation keywords organic mulching soil water consumption soybean yield 1 introduction soybean is an economically important agricultural crop across the world faostat 2016 its growing environment has been considered suitable in japan for many years uchino et al 2016 soybean is used as a source of oil seed in most countries saberali and mohammadi 2015 but in japan it has also become popular as vegetable cuisine tofu miso soy sauce kokobun 1991 and fodder crops in recent years uchino et al 2016 gifu prefecture is one of the top ranked soybean production areas in japan although hokaiddo and saga are the most productive regions for the crop konovsky et al 1994 however production of soybean under limited rainfall is a great challenge due to hot temperature climates ren et al 2016 bradford et al 2017 since the crop is highly sensitive to rainfall and temperature the climatic environment of japan is highly variable where june to september has typically the hottest temperature with greatest precipitation and sometimes is affected by typhoon with heavy rainfall however the climatic factors influencing physiology of soybean crop may be controlled to a large extent by using effective soil management practices to achieve beneficial soybean production mulching is one of the best soil and water management technologies that is crucial to restore soil moisture reduce soil evaporation alter soil temperature maintain soil health and improve water use efficiency as well as crop yields chakraborty et al 2008 kader et al 2017a organic and plastic materials have been beneficially used for mulching in crop fields to retain soil water and regulate soil heat although plastic mulching is familiar in the contemporary agriculture to get temporary benefits on soil environment for increasing higher product yield lópez lópez et al 2015 it brings adverse results of long term effects on soil quality farm profitability environmental contamination and eco system services steinmetz et al 2016 organic mulch materials like straw dry clips and shaded papers have several exceptional advantages over plastic mulch since they are cheap and environment friendly and add nutrients to soil after degradation kader et al 2017a organic mulching also maintains optimum soil temperature restricts soil evaporation enriches soil quality and suppresses weed growth jordán et al 2010 ranjan et al 2017 cereal straw is considered an ideal material for mulching because of its easy application in the field and it works as an insulator of soil temperature during hot days and cold nights ghosh et al 2006 sarkar et al 2007 straw mulching can minimize soil evaporation li et al 2013 and lower total evaporation during crop growing season in relatively high and low rainfall years balwinder singh et al 2011 however straw being a thin material is difficult to spread uniformly on the field and thus exerts spatially non uniform effects on the other hand shaded newspaper is non toxic and biodegradable it degrades naturally and incorporates into soil in relatively short period of time one or two layers of newspaper laid on the field may modify water and heat environments in the root zone soil newspaper also controls weed seeds munn 1992 and sometimes performs better than plastic mulch due to its eventual decomposition into soil ranjan et al 2017 the cost of newspaper is also lower than straw and plastic haapala et al 2014 and it is readily available and easy to use several researchers investigated the effects of organic mulching in terms of soil water availability cai et al 2015 li et al 2013 soil physical properties mulumba and lal 2008 jordán et al 2010 tillage and response of soil compaction to weather conditions for soybean siczek et al 2015 siczek and lipiec 2011 zribi et al 2015 evaluated the effectiveness of various mulching materials on evaporation control by laboratory experiments contradictory effects of mulching on soil moisture and temperature due to varying climatic conditions rainfall and temperature mulch material types soil energy behaviors soil characteristics and crop types have been reported zhang et al 2009 haapala et al 2015 soil moisture and temperature greatly influenced by micro climates are the vital factors to secure available water for plant growth regulate optimum heat and maintain plant rooting patterns zhou et al 2009 ren et al 2016 in hot weather days high soil temperature enhances evaporation and consequently reduces soil moisture organic mulching can suppress excess heat in soil and reduce fluctuation of daily soil temperature through latent heat of vaporization sarkar and singh 2007 these modifications of heat and soil moisture are important since rain fed soybean is very sensitive to water and heat stress especially during its reproductive flowering and fruiting stage irmak et al 2013 the temperature stress appeared at high soil temperature in bare soil can be minimized by using convenient organic mulches like straw and shaded newspaper in addition optimum soil temperature for soybean growth under mulching can be effective for safe water use and higher crop yield therefore a clear knowledge is needed on soil environments which influence water use efficiency and crop growth under different organic mulching to obtain higher crop yields in sub humid climates although the effects of straw mulching have been well studied kader et al 2017a akhtar et al 2019 no comprehensive research on the effects of shaded newspaper mulching on soil water consumption and extraction pattern under soybean cultivation was reported yet therefore it is important to know the effects of organic mulching for altering soil hydro thermal regimes under rain fed conditions that may provide favorable environments for soybean cultivation so a two year field experiment was done to investigate the effects of rice straw and shaded newspaper mulching materials on soil hydro thermal regimes soil moisture and temperature soil water consumption and its distribution in crop root zone which affect growth yield and water use efficiency of soybean under rain fed conditions in central japan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design field experiments were done in

mulching dry weight 0 46 kg m 2 shaded newspaper mulching two layers 0 30 kg m 2 and no mulching bare soil the average 1987 2016 mean annual air temperature of the study site is 16 1 c and the average annual rainfall is 1849 mm air temperature and rainfall are greater during summer june august than in the other months of the year in the study area climatic data pertinent to soybean cultivation such as rainfall air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation were measured by installing a weather station at the experimental site the average monthly climatic data are presented in table 1 reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated from the climate data by using penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the growing period of soybean was from 10 may to 27 august 110 days in 2015 and from 26 april to 15 august 111 days in 2016 the size of each experimental plot for soybean cultivation was 12 5 m2 5 m 2 5 m with a buffer zone of 0 5 m surrounding the plot soybean seeds were sown in the plots manually at 2 5 cm depth in four straight rows with spacing of 40 cm and seed to seed distance of 30 cm 2 2 monitoring soil moisture and temperature volumetric soil moisture contents were monitored at 5 15 and 25 cm depths in each treatment plots during 2015 and 2016 crop seasons by using water content reflectometer probes cs615 campbell scientific inc usa the probes were linked to a cr10x datalogger campbell scientific inc usa and the data were recorded at 1 h interval soil temperatures were recorded with copper plated temperature sensors tmc20 hd accuracy 0 25 c from 0 to 50 c linked to a u12 008 logger onset computer corporation usa at 5 15 and 25 cm depths in 2015 and 0 5 15 and 25 cm depths in 2016 the soil moisture and temperature sensors were installed horizontally at 5 15 and 25 cm soil depths between the rows and between the columns of each treatment at the center of the plot soil surface temperature was measured just below the mulch materials on the soil surface 2 3 measurement of soil physical properties undisturbed soil samples were collected after the experiments from three soil layers 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm within the effective root zone of the crop by using core samplers of 100 cm3 moisture contents of the soil samples at field capacity 33 kpa to permanent wilting point 1500 kpa were determined by centrifugation following russel and richards 1938 with a kokusan h 2000b centrifuge machine bulk densities of the samples were determined by drying them in oven at 105 c for 24 h soil organic matter content was determined by ignition method storer 1984 in which weight loss of the soil samples on ignition was measured the observed soil hydraulic properties bulk density and organic matter content under the three treatments straw newspaper and bare soil are listed in table 2 the soil in the study site was loamy sand or loam in the 0 30 cm soil profile kader et al 2017b the average saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of 0 30 cm soil profile was 2 6 cm h 1 which was measured by falling head method in laboratory 2 4 analysis of mulching effects 2 4 1 soil water consumption soybean is a shallow rooted crop with maximum rooting depth of 0 60 cm stone et al 1976 fan et al 2016 from the observation in our study soybean root was found concentrated within 0 30 cm soil depth therefore 0 30 cm soil depth was considered as effective root zone consequently most of the water uptake by the crop occurs within this effective root zone depth soil water consumption swc is the cumulative soil water reduction in the effective root zone between all consecutive rainfall events swci j throughout the soybean growing period swci j mm was estimated from the summation of moisture reductions in different soil layers i 1 m between two consecutive rainfall events j 1 n during the soybean growing season as 1 s w c j 1 n i 1 m s w c i j j 1 n i 1 m θ r a i j θ r b i j 1 d i θ r a i j θ f c i where θra i j cm3 cm 3 is moisture content of i th soil layer just after j th rainfall event θrb i j 1 cm3 cm 3 is moisture content of i th soil layer just before j 1 th rainfall event θfc i cm3 cm 3 is moisture content of i th soil layer at field capacity 33 kpa table 2 di mm is thickness of i th soil layer m is the number of soil layers and n is the number of major rainfall events three soil layers 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm and fourteen rainfall events were used to calculate swc for the two years experiments 2 4 2 total available moisture and soil moisture extraction theoretically available moisture am is the difference in soil moisture contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point that can be uptaken by plant roots total available soil water taw is the total amount of available moisture in the effective root zone taw can be used to quantify the maximum amount of water that plants can extract from the effective root zone the fraction of taw that plant roots can easily extract from root zone is called the total readily available moisture tram allen et al 1998 both taw and tram are useful indices to quantify the effects of mulching on soil moisture taw was calculated by 2 t a w i 1 m a m i i 1 m θ f c i θ w p i d i where θ fc i and θ wp i are the soil moisture contents cm3 cm 3 of i th soil layer at field capacity and permanent wilting point respectively soil moisture extraction in the i th layer smei was calculated by 3 s m e i δ θ i d i i 1 m δ θ i d i 100 where di is thickness of i th soil layer cm and δθ i is reduction of volumetric soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 of the i th soil layer between two consecutive rainfall events in eq 3 smei calculated for each soil layer expresses the ratio of soil moisture reduction in the i th layer to the total soil moisture reduction within the effective root zone by using soil moisture extraction ratio smei of each soil layer trami was estimated by 4 t r a m i a m i s m e i amongst the values of trami the smallest one was regarded as tram 2 5 growth attributes of soybean soybean was harvested at maturity on 27 august in 2015 and 14 august in 2016 the growth and yield attributes of the crop were recorded from ten sampled plants of 1 m2 1 m 1 m area for each treatment plant height number of nodulations per plant number of grains pod and seeds per plant total seed weight per plant green grain yield and total biomass yield were recorded manually the green grain seeds of 1 m2 were dried in oven at 60 c for 48 h and seed yield of each treatment was determined there from the index of leaf chlorophyll content expressed by leaf spad soil plant analytical development was measured at different growth stages of soybean from ten leaves per plant of each treatment using a spad meter spad 502 konica minolta japan water use efficiency wue g m 3 of the crop was calculated by 5 wue y 10 3 s w c where y is seed yield g m 2 and swc is total seasonal soil water consumption mm 2 6 data analysis analysis of variance was done using statistical software r foundation for statistical computing http www r project org to compare the mean growth attributes of soybean among the treatments multiple comparisons of means were analyzed using tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test at 5 significant level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions the micro climate for soybean growth was different in 2015 from 2016 due to yearly variation of air temperature and rainfall the daily mean air temperature during the periods of experiments 18 may 27 august 2015 and 26 april 14 august 2016 varied from 22 0 to 28 4 c in 2015 and 20 6 to 30 0 c in 2016 table 1 the mean air temperature during the soybean cultivation period was 24 8 c in 2015 and 25 4 c in 2016 the summer extended from june to august during which air temperature increased with the progress of soybean growth fig 1 monthly maximum air temperature was 37 4 c in 2015 and 41 5 c in 2016 both temperatures occurred in the month of august table 1 total rainfall 874 4 mm was higher in 2015 than 704 8 mm in 2016 the soybean was cultivated under rain fed conditions and no irrigation was applied mean daily reference evapotranspiration et o was 4 5 and 5 0 mm day 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively et o was greater in 2016 than in 2015 due to higher solar radiation and air temperature in 2016 than in 2015 table 1 3 2 soil moisture the daily average soil moisture contents at 5 15 and 25 cm soil depths during the soybean growing period of 2015 and 2016 are illustrated in fig 2 with the median first and third quartiles and minimum and maximum values the outliers shown by dotted legend in the boxplot of fig 2 reveal extreme soil moisture contents the soil moisture shows different patterns both for the treatments two mulch treatments and one bare soil and in the crop growing years newspaper mulching provided the greatest soil moisture content with higher median very close to mean for both years among the treatments whereas the bare soil provided the lowest seasonal moisture content with lower median in 2015 in both years the soil moisture content of bare soil fluctuated several outliers from very low to very high value while the mulching treatments exhibited a smaller fluctuation fewer outliers range in soil moisture fig 2 newspaper mulching maintained the highest average seasonal soil moisture content for both crop seasons 0 31 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 and 0 34 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 while bare soil provided the lowest average moisture content 0 28 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 and straw mulching provided the lowest average moisture content 0 32 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 the average soil moisture contents under the three treatments were higher in 2016 than in 2015 the straw mulch showed lower inter quartile range of data in both years indicating that the soil moisture had a high level of agreement over the soybean growing season the mulching treatments showed smaller fluctuations smaller outliers of soil moisture contents over 0 30 cm soil profile compared to the bare soil several outliers for both years the variations of hourly soil moisture contents under the mulching treatments in response to 54 2 mm rainfall on 21 june 2015 and 55 6 mm rainfall on 9 july 2016 are illustrated in fig 3 a and b respectively soil moisture increased during the rainfall hours and decreased afterwards with large differences in soil moisture observed among the three depths 5 15 and 25 cm and three treatments for both crop years because of one hour interval for soil moisture measurement the temporal changes in soil moisture might not represent the continuous exact changes after the start of the rainfall events we however focused on soil moisture reduction processes due to evaporation and downward water flow after the rainfall events organic mulch may have an effect to delay the infiltration of rainwater to the soil thus soil moisture content at 5 cm depth increased faster just after rainfall event than at 15 and 25 cm depths the hourly soil moisture reduction rate of 0 30 cm soil zone during 21 24 june 4 days was 0 22 0 84 and 0 88 mm h 1 under straw newspaper and bare soil respectively in response to 54 2 mm rainfall on 21 june 2015 fig 3 a similar reduction rate in soil moisture during 9 12 july was 0 48 0 49 and 0 70 mm h 1 under straw newspaper and bare soil respectively in response to 55 6 mm rainfall on 9 july 2016 fig 3 b so soil moisture reduction rate with straw and newspaper mulching decreased by 79 6 and 4 5 respectively in 2015 and 31 4 and 30 respectively in 2016 compared to bare soil straw mulching provided the lowest reduction rates of soil moisture compared to newspaper mulching and bare soil newspaper is a contiguous layer of mulching material and inherently is porous hygroscopic and expanding and shrinking with changes in its moisture content haapala et al 2014 newspaper mulch stored the largest quantity of soil moisture at 25 cm depth followed by straw mulch evaporation and drainage were the main factors to reduce soil moisture content in 0 30 cm soil profile just after rainfall events because of reduced evaporation rates the straw and newspaper mulching conserved soil moisture for longer periods and resulted in higher seasonal moisture content than the bare soil organic mulching e g straw and newspaper improved root growth of soybean and increased root exudates cai et al 2015 which might improve growth and development of soybean 3 3 soil water consumption the cumulative soil water consumptions swcs under three treatments are illustrated in fig 4 for the crop season of 2015 and 2016 swc in the treatment plots increased over the soybean growing periods the seasonal swc under straw newspaper and bare soil was 95 136 and 164 mm respectively in 2015 and 136 126 and 158 mm respectively in 2016 straw mulch provided 41 8 lower swc in 2015 and 13 9 lower swc in 2016 than bare soil while newspaper mulch provided 16 3 and 20 6 lower swc than bare soil in 2015 and 2016 respectively the straw and newspaper mulching suppressed evaporation from the soil and reduced swc while direct evaporation from the bare soil increased swc the bare soil released more water from the effective root zone 0 30 cm compared to the soils under mulching evaporation rate from soil mostly governed by soil moisture temperature and wind speed influenced water storage in the mulch layer and water flow into soil during rainfall events yan et al 2018 there were larger differences in swc between 2015 and 2016 for straw and newspaper mulch treatments than for the bare soil perhaps water contained in straw was readily transformed into vapor to satisfy evaporative demand from the soil and straw following energy balance at the soil surface in 2016 newspaper mulching also showed similar behavior saturated newspaper augmented evaporation at the mulch surface and caused water flow from soil to newspaper for further evaporation furthermore newspaper degraded quickly because of frequent rainfalls in 2015 and hence provided relatively high swc the bare soil produced maximum surface evaporation and consequently provided greater swc compared to the mulching treatments the mulch materials therefore provided a protection on soil surface and reduced soil evaporation rate with the consequent reduced swc and increased soil moisture storage in the root zone of soybean the reduced swc under straw and newspaper mulching therefore can play an important role for water saving in soybean cultivation 3 4 soil temperature the temporal variations in daily average soil temperature at three depths 5 15 and 25 cm in 2015 and four depths 0 5 15 and 25 cm in 2016 are illustrated in fig 5 a and b respectively the straw and newspaper mulches exerted varying effects on soil temperature in the two crop growing seasons soil temperature in all cases decreased with increasing depth of soil the daily mean temperature over the soybean growing period in bare soil at 5 and 25 cm depths was 26 4 c and 25 5 c respectively in 2015 and 23 3 c and 22 7 c respectively in 2016 the bare soil and straw mulch showed same seasonal average temperature 26 5 c at 5 cm depth in 2015 that was 1 0 c higher than that provided by newspaper mulch straw mulch provided slightly higher soil temperature at 15 and 25 cm depths in 2015 than the bare soil and newspaper mulch fig 5 a in 2016 the mean temperature at bare soil surface increased by 1 5 c during leaf formation june july and reproduction stages july august of soybean while at maturity stage august soil surface temperature increased by 0 92 c compared to newspaper the bare soil attained greater temperature at 5 cm depth than the soils under mulching in 2016 while soil temperatures at 15 and 25 cm depths were almost similar for all three treatments fig 5 b the average temperature difference between 5 cm and 25 cm depths was 0 84 0 74 and 0 97 c for straw newspaper and bare soil respectively in 2015 and 0 21 0 86 and 0 72 c respectively in 2016 the bare soil was more heated by air temperature and exhibited 0 2 c temperature difference within the root zone 0 30 cm the daily fluctuations of soil temperature up to 2 c were higher in the upper depth 5 cm than 0 5 1 c in the lower depths 15 and 25 cm of soil profile for better understating the effects of mulching on soil temperature during drying days after rainfall the hourly soil temperature variations of the three treatments at 5 and 25 cm depths during 22 24 june 72 h in 2015 and 5 l7 june 72 h in 2016 are illustrated in fig 6 a and b respectively for a 72 h variation of soil temperature the bare soil showed higher temperature than the soils under mulching at 5 cm depth and the newspaper mulch showed lower temperature at 25 cm depth among the three treatments during sunlight 11 am 7 pm the bare soil exhibited 2 c greater temperature than the mulching treatments at 5 cm depth but at 25 cm depth the difference in temperature was small 0 5 c at night time soil temperature decreased for all depths and treatments at crop development june to august and maturity late july to august stages soil temperature fluctuated by 0 64 c d 1 difference between maximum and minimum under straw mulch in 2015 while at the initial stages june the fluctuation was 0 95 c d 1 the lower fluctuation of soil temperature at crop development and maturity stages was due to reduction of solar radiation by plant canopy newspaper mulching provided lower soil temperature at 5 cm depth and exhibited smaller daily temperature fluctuations compared to the bare soil several previous studies revealed that paper mulch lowered soil temperature more than black plastic coolong 2010 transparent plastic pessala and hårdh 1977 straw munn 1992 and bare soil haapala et al 2014 the temperature reducing effect of the paper mulch was attributed to its lighter color that reflected incoming radiation which normally was absorbed by darker surfaces like bare soil or plastic mulch kader et al 2017c newspaper mulch created one contiguous layer of material which lowered soil temperature after being wetted by rainfall and by reflecting solar radiation on the other hand heat penetration into soil from straw mulch depends on specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of straw thermal diffusivity application of straw mulch can lower the peak soil temperatures due to its high reflectivity and low thermal diffusivity and interception of incoming radiation these effects of organic mulching however depend upon soil wetness incident radiation rate of mulch application as well as time of the year sarkar and singh 2007 3 5 soil moisture extraction pattern soil moisture extraction is the amount of water loss from the effective root zone 0 30 cm due to downward infiltration uptake by plant roots and evaporation from soil fig 7 illustrates soil moisture extraction pattern smep from the three soil layers 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm within root zone under different treatments straw newspaper and bare soil the maximum soil moisture extraction occurred from 0 10 cm soil layer and minimum extraction occurred from 20 30 cm soil layer under all treatments these observations are consistent with the findings of chakraborty et al 2008 and sarkar et al 2007 soil moisture extraction for all three treatments in 2015 was significantly p 0 05 greater 45 in 0 10 cm soil layer than in 10 20 and 20 30 cm layers the two lower soil layers provided statistically similar soil moisture extraction 24 and 30 fig 7 a in 2015 almost half of the total soil moisture extracted from the root zone in all treatments was extracted from the 0 10 cm soil layer while 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers showed small difference in soil moisture extraction in 2016 the top soil layer provided the highest soil moisture extractions which were however 45 for all treatments for the lower soil layers soil moisture extractions were approximately similar 25 26 fig 7 b demonstrates that smep was more uniform within root zone in 2016 compared to that in 2015 the variation in smep over the two crop years 2015 and 2016 was due to the change in soil environment by tillage operations and soil compactions in the study of lenka et al 2009 with increasing water input soil moisture extraction occurred mostly from the upper layers due to increased root mass and availability of water for evaporation bandyopadhyay et al 2003 also showed for wheat that maximum 45 soil moisture extraction occurred from 0 15 cm soil profile and the extraction decreased with increasing depth of soil water extraction was small at initial growth stage but increased at development and maturity stages of soybean because of greater amount of water uptake for physiological activities of the plants the growth attributes of soybean biomass grain and seed yields were larger in 2016 than in 2015 table 3 indicating deeper rooting zone and different soil moisture extraction in the three soil layers in 2016 3 6 total readily available soil moisture total readily available soil moisture tram largely depends on smep from the 0 30 cm soil profile the seasonal tram was the highest under bare soil 44 2 mm as illustrated in fig 8 the mulching treatments provided statistically similar p 0 05 tram both in 2015 32 0 to 33 5 mm and 2016 41 5 mm the ratio of tram to total available water taw for each treatment standardized with the differences of available soil moisture among the treatments shows similar pattern as tram fig 8 furthermore soil moisture extractions from the top layer under straw and newspaper mulching were slightly higher than that under bare soil fig 7 a for high rainfall amount in 2015 soil moisture extraction was larger and tram was smaller for the upper layer than for the lower layers on the other hand although available moistures under mulching treatments were slightly smaller in the top soil layer table 2 than in the lower soil layers no noticeable difference was observed in soil moisture extraction among the three soil layers assuming that irrigation is to be applied the smaller tram under the mulching treatments in 2015 implies that the amount of water for an irrigation application becomes small and if the soil water consumption would be same the irrigation interval would become short this is because the irrigation interval is calculated by dividing tram by daily soil water consumption in the effective root zone however the effect of mulching on tram depends on meteorological conditions and depth of rooting zone there was no difference in tram between straw and newspaper mulching 3 7 yields and water use efficiency of soybean the straw and newspaper mulching helped producing higher yield of soybean compared to bare soil the newspaper mulching provided greater yield due to higher plant height nodulations number of grains pod seeds per plant and plant biomass than straw mulching table 3 there were significant p 0 05 difference in the growth and yield attributes of soybean between 2015 and 2016 possibly due to damaging effect of excess rainfall in 2015 crop growing period improved soil hydro thermal regimes soil moisture soil temperature swc and smep and climatic environments rainfall and air temperature due to the effects of mulching enhanced soybean yields by improving crop physiology the straw and newspaper mulching augmented soybean yield by 12 13 in 2015 and 6 6 37 2 in 2016 possibly due to higher values of nodulations leaf chlorophyll and biomass compared to bare soil table 3 almost a similar observation of yield increase 16 of rain fed soybean under wheat straw mulching was reported in india dass and bhattacharyya 2017 increasing soil moisture and decreasing soil temperature enhanced 5 7 leaf chlorophyll concentration and 11 22 nodulations of soybean that attributed higher growth and yields under the two mulching treatments table 3 the effects of leaf chlorophyll and nodulations in increasing soybean yield under organic mulching were also reported by dass and bhattacharyya 2017 and siczek and lipiec 2011 newspaper mulching compared to other treatments conserved higher amount of soil moisture fig 2 maintained up to 2 c lower soil temperature in the root zone fig 3 and provided the highest organic matter content 4 33 3 26 and 2 79 table 2 all of which positively contributed to growth and yield attributes of soybean table 3 the increased organic matter from rapidly decomposed organic mulching materials straw and newspaper might contribute additional nutrients for soybean plants a similar result was also reported by kader et al 2017c the decreased soil temperature responded to increase soybean yield the reason for which was clarified by arora et al 2011 improved growth and yield of soybean due to organic mulching have also been reported by other investigators arora et al 2011 siczek and lipiec 2011 water use efficiency wue of soybean was governed by swc and yield of the crop table 3 wue increased by 28 7 32 4 and 52 3 under straw newspaper and bare soil treatments in 2016 compared to that in 2015 table 3 seed yield of soybean was higher under newspaper mulching in both crop growing years than under other two treatments but the lower swc under straw mulching compared to the other treatments in 2015 significantly p 0 05 improved wue the two mulching treatments improved wue over that in bare soil this observation was similar to that of zheng et al 2017 and steinmetz et al 2016 among the three treatments straw and newspaper much provided the highest wue in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 3 the straw mulch provided 40 2 and 25 2 greater wue in 2015 and 2016 respectively compared to the bare soil while the newspaper mulch provided 47 8 and 26 3 greater wue in 2015 and 2016 respectively than the bare soil 4 conclusions two years 2015 and 2016 field experiments with soybean cultivation under rain fed condition in central japan revealed that rice straw and newspaper mulching enhanced soil moisture and water use efficiency and lowered soil temperature as well as soil water consumption swc compared to bare soil mulching exerted greater effects on seasonal soil moisture compared to bare soil and reduced soil moisture fluctuations within the crop root zone it lowered soil temperature by 2 c at 5 cm depth and 0 5 1 0 c at 15 25 cm depths compared to bare soil during the two soybean growing seasons compared to bare soil straw mulching increased swc by 41 8 in 2015 and 13 9 in 2016 the corresponding increase in swc for newspaper mulching was 16 6 and 20 6 soil moisture extraction was the highest from 0 to 10 cm depth 38 followed by 10 20 cm 26 35 and 20 30 cm 24 29 under the three treatments in both soybean growing seasons total readily available soil moisture tram varied due to different root distributions and soil characteristics water use efficiency wue increased by 25 47 under mulching compared to bare soil plant biomass plant height leaf chlorophyll nodultions grain and seed yields as well as wue of rain fed soybean increased significantly p 0 05 under the mulching treatments compared to bare soil straw and newspaper mulching increased soybean yield by 12 13 and 6 6 37 2 respectively compared to bare soil the increase was mainly due to 11 44 increase in nodulation 5 7 increase in leaf chlorophyll and 4 34 increase in plant biomass under mulching in two cropping seasons although both the organic mulches provided good results newspaper mulch resulted in lower temperature improved swc greater yield and increased wue therefore newspaper would be an alternative option to straw materials for modifying soil hydro thermal regimes in rain fed soybean cultivation acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the gifu university of japan for

10914,soybean glycine max is a commercially important oilseed crop across the world it is also popularly used as vegetables cookery and fodder crops in japan in areas with limited rainfall and high temperature mulching can provide greater yield of rain fed soybean by improving soil hydro thermal regimes however organic mulching like rice straw and shaded newspaper being inexpensive rapidly degradable easy to use and environment friendly may provide more benefits than plastic mulching field experiments with rain fed soybean cultivation were done in 2015 and 2016 at gifu university farm in japan the purposes were to investigate the effects of rice straw and newspaper mulching on moisture and temperature regimes of soil soil water consumption swc soil moisture extraction pattern smep total readily available moisture tram water use efficiency wue as well as growth and yield of soybean mulching increased seasonal soil moisture content with lesser fluctuations in the root zone compared to bare soil and lowered soil temperature by 2 c at 5 cm and 0 5 1 0 c at 15 25 cm soil depths straw mulch reduced swc by 41 8 and 13 9 in 2015 and 2016 respectively compared to bare soil the corresponding reduction in swc under newspaper mulch was 16 6 and 20 6 consequently mulching improved wue by 25 47 compared to bare soil mulching significantly p 0 05 improved plant height leaf chlorophyll content nodulations grain pod and seed numbers biomass and grain and seed yields of soybean compared to bare soil grain yield increased by 12 13 under straw mulching and 6 6 37 2 under newspaper mulching compared to bare soil newspaper mulch provided higher yield and wue by maintaining lower soil temperature and swc and greater soil moisture compared to straw mulch thus newspaper can be an alternative option to rice straw mulch for improving soil hydro thermal regimes for rain fed soybean cultivation keywords organic mulching soil water consumption soybean yield 1 introduction soybean is an economically important agricultural crop across the world faostat 2016 its growing environment has been considered suitable in japan for many years uchino et al 2016 soybean is used as a source of oil seed in most countries saberali and mohammadi 2015 but in japan it has also become popular as vegetable cuisine tofu miso soy sauce kokobun 1991 and fodder crops in recent years uchino et al 2016 gifu prefecture is one of the top ranked soybean production areas in japan although hokaiddo and saga are the most productive regions for the crop konovsky et al 1994 however production of soybean under limited rainfall is a great challenge due to hot temperature climates ren et al 2016 bradford et al 2017 since the crop is highly sensitive to rainfall and temperature the climatic environment of japan is highly variable where june to september has typically the hottest temperature with greatest precipitation and sometimes is affected by typhoon with heavy rainfall however the climatic factors influencing physiology of soybean crop may be controlled to a large extent by using effective soil management practices to achieve beneficial soybean production mulching is one of the best soil and water management technologies that is crucial to restore soil moisture reduce soil evaporation alter soil temperature maintain soil health and improve water use efficiency as well as crop yields chakraborty et al 2008 kader et al 2017a organic and plastic materials have been beneficially used for mulching in crop fields to retain soil water and regulate soil heat although plastic mulching is familiar in the contemporary agriculture to get temporary benefits on soil environment for increasing higher product yield lópez lópez et al 2015 it brings adverse results of long term effects on soil quality farm profitability environmental contamination and eco system services steinmetz et al 2016 organic mulch materials like straw dry clips and shaded papers have several exceptional advantages over plastic mulch since they are cheap and environment friendly and add nutrients to soil after degradation kader et al 2017a organic mulching also maintains optimum soil temperature restricts soil evaporation enriches soil quality and suppresses weed growth jordán et al 2010 ranjan et al 2017 cereal straw is considered an ideal material for mulching because of its easy application in the field and it works as an insulator of soil temperature during hot days and cold nights ghosh et al 2006 sarkar et al 2007 straw mulching can minimize soil evaporation li et al 2013 and lower total evaporation during crop growing season in relatively high and low rainfall years balwinder singh et al 2011 however straw being a thin material is difficult to spread uniformly on the field and thus exerts spatially non uniform effects on the other hand shaded newspaper is non toxic and biodegradable it degrades naturally and incorporates into soil in relatively short period of time one or two layers of newspaper laid on the field may modify water and heat environments in the root zone soil newspaper also controls weed seeds munn 1992 and sometimes performs better than plastic mulch due to its eventual decomposition into soil ranjan et al 2017 the cost of newspaper is also lower than straw and plastic haapala et al 2014 and it is readily available and easy to use several researchers investigated the effects of organic mulching in terms of soil water availability cai et al 2015 li et al 2013 soil physical properties mulumba and lal 2008 jordán et al 2010 tillage and response of soil compaction to weather conditions for soybean siczek et al 2015 siczek and lipiec 2011 zribi et al 2015 evaluated the effectiveness of various mulching materials on evaporation control by laboratory experiments contradictory effects of mulching on soil moisture and temperature due to varying climatic conditions rainfall and temperature mulch material types soil energy behaviors soil characteristics and crop types have been reported zhang et al 2009 haapala et al 2015 soil moisture and temperature greatly influenced by micro climates are the vital factors to secure available water for plant growth regulate optimum heat and maintain plant rooting patterns zhou et al 2009 ren et al 2016 in hot weather days high soil temperature enhances evaporation and consequently reduces soil moisture organic mulching can suppress excess heat in soil and reduce fluctuation of daily soil temperature through latent heat of vaporization sarkar and singh 2007 these modifications of heat and soil moisture are important since rain fed soybean is very sensitive to water and heat stress especially during its reproductive flowering and fruiting stage irmak et al 2013 the temperature stress appeared at high soil temperature in bare soil can be minimized by using convenient organic mulches like straw and shaded newspaper in addition optimum soil temperature for soybean growth under mulching can be effective for safe water use and higher crop yield therefore a clear knowledge is needed on soil environments which influence water use efficiency and crop growth under different organic mulching to obtain higher crop yields in sub humid climates although the effects of straw mulching have been well studied kader et al 2017a akhtar et al 2019 no comprehensive research on the effects of shaded newspaper mulching on soil water consumption and extraction pattern under soybean cultivation was reported yet therefore it is important to know the effects of organic mulching for altering soil hydro thermal regimes under rain fed conditions that may provide favorable environments for soybean cultivation so a two year field experiment was done to investigate the effects of rice straw and shaded newspaper mulching materials on soil hydro thermal regimes soil moisture and temperature soil water consumption and its distribution in crop root zone which affect growth yield and water use efficiency of soybean under rain fed conditions in central japan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental design field experiments were done in two consecutive years may august of 2015 and april august of 2016 at gifu university farm in central japan 35 27 n and 136 44 e 12 m above sea level with rain fed soybean cultivation under rice straw mulching dry weight 0 46 kg m 2 shaded newspaper mulching two layers 0 30 kg m 2 and no mulching bare soil the average 1987 2016 mean annual air temperature of the study site is 16 1 c and the average annual rainfall is 1849 mm air temperature and rainfall are greater during summer june august than in the other months of the year in the study area climatic data pertinent to soybean cultivation such as rainfall air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation were measured by installing a weather station at the experimental site the average monthly climatic data are presented in table 1 reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated from the climate data by using penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the growing period of soybean was from 10 may to 27 august 110 days in 2015 and from 26 april to 15 august 111 days in 2016 the size of each experimental plot for soybean cultivation was 12 5 m2 5 m 2 5 m with a buffer zone of 0 5 m surrounding the plot soybean seeds were sown in the plots manually at 2 5 cm depth in four straight rows with spacing of 40 cm and seed to seed distance of 30 cm 2 2 monitoring soil moisture and temperature volumetric soil moisture contents were monitored at 5 15 and 25 cm depths in each treatment plots during 2015 and 2016 crop seasons by using water content reflectometer probes cs615 campbell scientific inc usa the probes were linked to a cr10x datalogger campbell scientific inc usa and the data were recorded at 1 h interval soil temperatures were recorded with copper plated temperature sensors tmc20 hd accuracy 0 25 c from 0 to 50 c linked to a u12 008 logger onset computer corporation usa at 5 15 and 25 cm depths in 2015 and 0 5 15 and 25 cm depths in 2016 the soil moisture and temperature sensors were installed horizontally at 5 15 and 25 cm soil depths between the rows and between the columns of each treatment at the center of the plot soil surface temperature was measured just below the mulch materials on the soil surface 2 3 measurement of soil physical properties undisturbed soil samples were collected after the experiments from three soil layers 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm within the effective root zone of the crop by using core samplers of 100 cm3 moisture contents of the soil samples at field capacity 33 kpa to permanent wilting point 1500 kpa were determined by centrifugation following russel and richards 1938 with a kokusan h 2000b centrifuge machine bulk densities of the samples were determined by drying them in oven at 105 c for 24 h soil organic matter content was determined by ignition method storer 1984 in which weight loss of the soil samples on ignition was measured the observed soil hydraulic properties bulk density and organic matter content under the three treatments straw newspaper and bare soil are listed in table 2 the soil in the study site was loamy sand or loam in the 0 30 cm soil profile kader et al 2017b the average saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of 0 30 cm soil profile was 2 6 cm h 1 which was measured by falling head method in laboratory 2 4 analysis of mulching effects 2 4 1 soil water consumption soybean is a shallow rooted crop with maximum rooting depth of 0 60 cm stone et al 1976 fan et al 2016 from the observation in our study soybean root was found concentrated within 0 30 cm soil depth therefore 0 30 cm soil depth was considered as effective root zone consequently most of the water uptake by the crop occurs within this effective root zone depth soil water consumption swc is the cumulative soil water reduction in the effective root zone between all consecutive rainfall events swci j throughout the soybean growing period swci j mm was estimated from the summation of moisture reductions in different soil layers i 1 m between two consecutive rainfall events j 1 n during the soybean growing season as 1 s w c j 1 n i 1 m s w c i j j 1 n i 1 m θ r a i j θ r b i j 1 d i θ r a i j θ f c i where θra i j cm3 cm 3 is moisture content of i th soil layer just after j th rainfall event θrb i j 1 cm3 cm 3 is moisture content of i th soil layer just before j 1 th rainfall event θfc i cm3 cm 3 is moisture content of i th soil layer at field capacity 33 kpa table 2 di mm is thickness of i th soil layer m is the number of soil layers and n is the number of major rainfall events three soil layers 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm and fourteen rainfall events were used to calculate swc for the two years experiments 2 4 2 total available moisture and soil moisture extraction theoretically available moisture am is the difference in soil moisture contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point that can be uptaken by plant roots total available soil water taw is the total amount of available moisture in the effective root zone taw can be used to quantify the maximum amount of water that plants can extract from the effective root zone the fraction of taw that plant roots can easily extract from root zone is called the total readily available moisture tram allen et al 1998 both taw and tram are useful indices to quantify the effects of mulching on soil moisture taw was calculated by 2 t a w i 1 m a m i i 1 m θ f c i θ w p i d i where θ fc i and θ wp i are the soil moisture contents cm3 cm 3 of i th soil layer at field capacity and permanent wilting point respectively soil moisture extraction in the i th layer smei was calculated by 3 s m e i δ θ i d i i 1 m δ θ i d i 100 where di is thickness of i th soil layer cm and δθ i is reduction of volumetric soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 of the i th soil layer between two consecutive rainfall events in eq 3 smei calculated for each soil layer expresses the ratio of soil moisture reduction in the i th layer to the total soil moisture reduction within the effective root zone by using soil moisture extraction ratio smei of each soil layer trami was estimated by 4 t r a m i a m i s m e i amongst the values of trami the smallest one was regarded as tram 2 5 growth attributes of soybean soybean was harvested at maturity on 27 august in 2015 and 14 august in 2016 the growth and yield attributes of the crop were recorded from ten sampled plants of 1 m2 1 m 1 m area for each

foundation for statistical computing http www r project org to compare the mean growth attributes of soybean among the treatments multiple comparisons of means were analyzed using tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test at 5 significant level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions the micro climate for soybean growth was different in 2015 from 2016 due to yearly variation of air temperature and rainfall the daily mean air temperature during the periods of experiments 18 may 27 august 2015 and 26 april 14 august 2016 varied from 22 0 to 28 4 c in 2015 and 20 6 to 30 0 c in 2016 table 1 the mean air temperature during the soybean cultivation period was 24 8 c in 2015 and 25 4 c in 2016 the summer extended from june to august during which air temperature increased with the progress of soybean growth fig 1 monthly maximum air temperature was 37 4 c in 2015 and 41 5 c in 2016 both temperatures occurred in the month of august table 1 total rainfall 874 4 mm was higher in 2015 than 704 8 mm in 2016 the soybean was cultivated under rain fed conditions and no irrigation was applied mean daily reference evapotranspiration et o was 4 5 and 5 0 mm day 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively et o was greater in 2016 than in 2015 due to higher solar radiation and air temperature in 2016 than in 2015 table 1 3 2 soil moisture the daily average soil moisture contents at 5 15 and 25 cm soil depths during the soybean growing period of 2015 and 2016 are illustrated in fig 2 with the median first and third quartiles and minimum and maximum values the outliers shown by dotted legend in the boxplot of fig 2 reveal extreme soil moisture contents the soil moisture shows different patterns both for the treatments two mulch treatments and one bare soil and in the crop growing years newspaper mulching provided the greatest soil moisture content with higher median very close to mean for both years among the treatments whereas the bare soil provided the lowest seasonal moisture content with lower median in 2015 in both years the soil moisture content of bare soil fluctuated several outliers from very low to very high value while the mulching treatments exhibited a smaller fluctuation fewer outliers range in soil moisture fig 2 newspaper mulching maintained the highest average seasonal soil moisture content for both crop seasons 0 31 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 and 0 34 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 while bare soil provided the lowest average moisture content 0 28 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 and straw mulching provided the lowest average moisture content 0 32 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 the average soil moisture contents under the three treatments were higher in 2016 than in 2015 the straw mulch showed lower inter quartile range of data in both years indicating that the soil moisture had a high level of agreement over the soybean growing season the mulching treatments showed smaller fluctuations smaller outliers of soil moisture contents over 0 30 cm soil profile compared to the bare soil several outliers for both years the variations of hourly soil moisture contents under the mulching treatments in response to 54 2 mm rainfall on 21 june 2015 and 55 6 mm rainfall on 9 july 2016 are illustrated in fig 3 a and b respectively soil moisture increased during the rainfall hours and decreased afterwards with large differences in soil moisture observed among the three depths 5 15 and 25 cm and three treatments for both crop years because of one hour interval for soil moisture measurement the temporal changes in soil moisture might not represent the continuous exact changes after the start of the rainfall events we however focused on soil moisture reduction processes due to evaporation and downward water flow after the rainfall events organic mulch may have an effect to delay the infiltration of rainwater to the soil thus soil moisture content at 5 cm depth increased faster just after rainfall event than at 15 and 25 cm depths the hourly soil moisture reduction rate of 0 30 cm soil zone during 21 24 june 4 days was 0 22 0 84 and 0 88 mm h 1 under straw newspaper and bare soil respectively in response to 54 2 mm rainfall on 21 june 2015 fig 3 a similar reduction rate in soil moisture during 9 12 july was 0 48 0 49 and 0 70 mm h 1 under straw newspaper and bare soil respectively in response to 55 6 mm rainfall on 9 july 2016 fig 3 b so soil moisture reduction rate with straw and newspaper mulching decreased by 79 6 and 4 5 respectively in 2015 and 31 4 and 30 respectively in 2016 compared to bare soil straw mulching provided the lowest reduction rates of soil moisture compared to newspaper mulching and bare soil newspaper is a contiguous layer of mulching material and inherently is porous hygroscopic and expanding and shrinking with changes in its moisture content haapala et al 2014 newspaper mulch stored the largest quantity of soil moisture at 25 cm depth followed by straw mulch evaporation and drainage were the main factors to reduce soil moisture content in 0 30 cm soil profile just after rainfall events because of reduced evaporation rates the straw and newspaper mulching conserved soil moisture for longer periods and resulted in higher seasonal moisture content than the bare soil organic mulching e g straw and newspaper improved root growth of soybean and increased root exudates cai et al 2015 which might improve growth and development of soybean 3 3 soil water consumption the cumulative soil water consumptions swcs under three treatments are illustrated in fig 4 for the crop season of 2015 and 2016 swc in the treatment plots increased over the soybean growing periods the seasonal swc under straw newspaper and bare soil was 95 136 and 164 mm respectively in 2015 and 136 126 and 158 mm respectively in 2016 straw mulch provided 41 8 lower swc in 2015 and 13 9 lower swc in 2016 than bare soil while newspaper mulch provided 16 3 and 20 6 lower swc than bare soil in 2015 and 2016 respectively the straw and newspaper mulching suppressed evaporation from the soil and reduced swc while direct evaporation from the bare soil increased swc the bare soil released more water from the effective root zone 0 30 cm compared to the soils under mulching evaporation rate from soil mostly governed by soil moisture temperature and wind speed influenced water storage in the mulch layer and water flow into soil during rainfall events yan et al 2018 there were larger differences in swc between 2015 and 2016 for straw and newspaper mulch treatments than for the bare soil perhaps water contained in straw was readily transformed into vapor to satisfy evaporative demand from the soil and straw following energy balance at the soil surface in 2016 newspaper mulching also showed similar behavior saturated newspaper augmented evaporation at the mulch surface and caused water flow from soil to newspaper for further evaporation furthermore newspaper degraded quickly because of frequent rainfalls in 2015 and hence provided relatively high swc the bare soil produced maximum surface evaporation and consequently provided greater swc compared to the mulching treatments the mulch materials therefore provided a protection on soil surface and reduced soil evaporation rate with the consequent reduced swc and increased soil moisture storage in the root zone of soybean the reduced swc under straw and newspaper mulching therefore can play an important role for water saving in soybean cultivation 3 4 soil temperature the temporal variations in daily average soil temperature at three depths 5 15 and 25 cm in 2015 and four depths 0 5 15 and 25 cm in 2016 are illustrated in fig 5 a and b respectively the straw and newspaper mulches exerted varying effects on soil temperature in the two crop growing seasons soil temperature in all cases decreased with increasing depth of soil the daily mean temperature over the soybean growing period in bare soil at 5 and 25 cm depths was 26 4 c and 25 5 c respectively in 2015 and 23 3 c and 22 7 c respectively in 2016 the bare soil and straw mulch showed same seasonal average temperature 26 5 c at 5 cm depth in 2015 that was 1 0 c higher than that provided by newspaper mulch straw mulch provided slightly higher soil temperature at 15 and 25 cm depths in 2015 than the bare soil and newspaper mulch fig 5 a in 2016 the mean temperature at bare soil surface increased by 1 5 c during leaf formation june july and reproduction stages july august of soybean while at maturity stage august soil surface temperature increased by 0 92 c compared to newspaper the bare soil attained greater temperature at 5 cm depth than the soils under mulching in 2016 while soil temperatures at 15 and 25 cm depths were almost similar for all three treatments fig 5 b the average temperature difference between 5 cm and 25 cm depths was 0 84 0 74 and 0 97 c for straw newspaper and bare soil respectively in 2015 and 0 21 0 86 and 0 72 c respectively in 2016 the bare soil was more heated by air temperature and exhibited 0 2 c temperature difference within the root zone 0 30 cm the daily fluctuations of soil temperature up to 2 c were higher in the upper depth 5 cm than 0 5 1 c in the lower depths 15 and 25 cm of soil profile for better understating the effects of mulching on soil temperature during drying days after rainfall the hourly soil temperature variations of the three treatments at 5 and 25 cm depths during 22 24 june 72 h in 2015 and 5 l7 june 72 h in 2016 are illustrated in fig 6 a and b respectively for a 72 h variation of soil temperature the bare soil showed higher temperature than the soils under mulching at 5 cm depth and the newspaper mulch showed lower temperature at 25 cm depth among the three treatments during sunlight 11 am 7 pm the bare soil exhibited 2 c greater temperature than the mulching treatments at 5 cm depth but at 25 cm depth the difference in temperature was small 0 5 c at night time soil temperature decreased for all depths and treatments at crop development june to august and maturity late july to august stages soil temperature fluctuated by 0 64 c d 1 difference between maximum and minimum under straw mulch in 2015 while at the initial stages june the fluctuation was 0 95 c d 1 the lower fluctuation of soil temperature at crop development and maturity stages was due to reduction of solar radiation by plant canopy newspaper mulching provided lower soil temperature at 5 cm depth and exhibited smaller daily temperature fluctuations compared to the bare soil several previous studies revealed that paper mulch lowered soil temperature more than black plastic coolong 2010 transparent plastic pessala and hårdh 1977 straw munn 1992 and bare soil haapala et al 2014 the temperature reducing effect of the paper mulch was attributed to its lighter color that reflected incoming radiation which normally was absorbed by darker surfaces like bare soil or plastic mulch kader et al 2017c newspaper mulch created one contiguous layer of material which lowered soil temperature after being wetted by rainfall and by reflecting solar radiation on the other hand heat penetration into soil from straw mulch depends on specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of straw thermal diffusivity application of straw mulch can lower the peak soil temperatures due to its high reflectivity and low thermal diffusivity and interception of incoming radiation these effects of organic mulching however depend upon soil wetness incident radiation rate of mulch application as well as time of the year sarkar and singh 2007 3 5 soil moisture extraction pattern soil moisture extraction is the amount of water loss from the effective root zone 0 30 cm due to downward infiltration uptake by plant roots and evaporation from soil fig 7 illustrates soil moisture extraction pattern smep from the three soil layers 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm within root zone under different treatments straw newspaper and bare soil the maximum soil moisture extraction occurred from 0 10 cm soil layer and minimum extraction occurred from 20 30 cm soil layer under all treatments these observations are consistent with the findings of chakraborty et al 2008 and sarkar et al 2007 soil moisture extraction for all three treatments in 2015 was significantly p 0 05 greater 45 in 0 10 cm soil layer than in 10 20 and 20 30 cm layers the two lower soil layers provided statistically similar soil moisture extraction 24 and 30 fig 7 a in 2015 almost half of the total soil moisture extracted from the root zone in all treatments was extracted from the 0 10 cm soil layer while 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers showed small difference in soil moisture extraction in 2016 the top soil layer provided the highest soil moisture extractions which were however 45 for all treatments for the lower soil layers soil moisture extractions were approximately similar 25 26 fig 7 b demonstrates that smep was more uniform within root zone in 2016 compared to that in 2015 the variation in smep over the two crop years 2015 and 2016 was due to the change in soil environment by tillage operations and soil compactions in the study of lenka et al 2009 with increasing water input soil moisture extraction occurred mostly from the upper layers due to increased root mass and availability of water for evaporation bandyopadhyay et al 2003 also showed for wheat that maximum 45 soil moisture extraction occurred from 0 15 cm soil profile and the extraction decreased with increasing depth of soil water extraction was small at initial growth stage but increased at development and maturity stages of soybean because of greater amount of water uptake for physiological activities of the plants the growth attributes of soybean biomass grain and seed yields were larger in 2016 than in 2015 table 3 indicating deeper rooting zone and different soil moisture extraction in the three soil layers in 2016 3 6 total readily available soil moisture total readily available soil moisture tram largely depends on smep from the 0 30 cm soil profile the seasonal tram was the highest under bare soil 44 2 mm as illustrated in fig 8 the mulching treatments provided statistically similar p 0 05 tram both in 2015 32 0 to 33 5 mm and 2016 41 5 mm the ratio of tram to total available water taw for each treatment standardized with the differences of available soil moisture among the treatments shows similar pattern as tram fig 8 furthermore soil moisture extractions from the top layer under straw and newspaper mulching were slightly higher than that under bare soil fig 7 a for high rainfall amount in 2015 soil moisture extraction was larger and tram was smaller for the upper layer than for the lower layers on the other hand although available moistures under mulching treatments were slightly smaller in the top soil layer table 2 than in the lower soil layers no noticeable difference was observed in soil moisture extraction among the three soil layers assuming that irrigation is to be applied the smaller tram under the mulching treatments in 2015 implies that the amount of water for an irrigation application becomes small and if the soil water consumption would be same the irrigation interval would become short this is because the irrigation interval is calculated by dividing tram by daily soil water consumption in the effective root zone however the effect of mulching on tram depends on meteorological conditions and depth of rooting zone there was no difference in tram between straw and newspaper mulching 3 7 yields and water use efficiency of soybean the straw and newspaper mulching helped producing higher yield of soybean compared to bare soil the newspaper mulching provided greater yield due to higher plant height nodulations number of grains pod seeds per plant and plant biomass than straw mulching table 3 there were significant p 0 05 difference in the growth and yield attributes of soybean between 2015 and 2016 possibly due to damaging effect of excess rainfall in 2015 crop growing period improved soil hydro thermal regimes soil moisture soil temperature swc and smep and climatic environments rainfall and air temperature due to the effects of mulching enhanced soybean yields by improving crop physiology the straw and newspaper mulching augmented soybean yield by 12 13 in 2015 and 6 6 37 2 in 2016 possibly due to higher values of nodulations leaf chlorophyll and biomass compared to bare soil table 3 almost a similar observation of yield increase 16 of rain fed soybean under wheat straw mulching was reported in india dass and bhattacharyya 2017 increasing soil moisture and decreasing soil temperature enhanced 5 7 leaf chlorophyll concentration and 11 22 nodulations of soybean that attributed higher growth and yields under the two mulching treatments table 3 the effects of leaf chlorophyll and nodulations in increasing soybean yield under organic mulching were also reported by dass and bhattacharyya 2017 and siczek and lipiec 2011 newspaper mulching compared to other treatments conserved higher amount of soil moisture fig 2 maintained up to 2 c lower soil temperature in the root zone fig 3 and provided the highest organic matter content 4 33 3 26 and 2 79 table 2 all of which positively contributed to growth and yield attributes of soybean table 3 the increased organic matter from rapidly decomposed organic mulching materials straw and newspaper might contribute additional nutrients for soybean plants a similar result was also reported by kader et al 2017c the decreased soil temperature responded to increase soybean yield the reason for which was clarified by arora et al 2011 improved growth and yield of soybean due to organic mulching have also been reported by other investigators arora et al 2011 siczek and lipiec 2011 water use efficiency wue of soybean was governed by swc and yield of the crop table 3 wue increased by 28 7 32 4 and 52 3 under straw newspaper and bare soil treatments in 2016 compared to that in 2015 table 3 seed yield of soybean was higher under newspaper mulching in both crop growing years than under other two treatments but the lower swc under straw mulching compared to the other treatments in 2015 significantly p 0 05 improved wue the two mulching treatments improved wue over that in bare soil this observation was similar to that of zheng et al 2017 and steinmetz et al 2016 among the three treatments straw and newspaper much provided the highest wue in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 3 the straw mulch provided 40 2 and 25 2 greater wue in 2015 and 2016 respectively compared to the bare soil while the newspaper mulch provided 47 8 and 26 3 greater wue in 2015 and 2016 respectively than the bare soil 4 conclusions two years 2015 and 2016 field experiments with soybean cultivation under rain fed condition in central japan revealed that rice straw and newspaper mulching enhanced soil moisture and water use efficiency and lowered soil temperature as well as soil water consumption swc compared to bare soil mulching exerted greater effects on seasonal soil moisture compared to bare soil and reduced soil moisture fluctuations within the crop root zone it lowered soil temperature by 2 c at 5 cm depth and 0 5 1 0 c at 15 25 cm depths compared to bare soil during the two soybean growing seasons compared to bare soil straw mulching increased swc by 41 8 in 2015 and 13 9 in 2016 the corresponding increase in swc for newspaper mulching was 16 6 and 20 6 soil moisture extraction was the highest from 0 to 10 cm depth 38 followed by 10 20 cm 26 35 and 20 30 cm 24 29 under the three treatments in both soybean growing seasons total readily available soil moisture tram varied due to different root distributions and soil characteristics water use efficiency wue increased by 25 47 under mulching compared to bare soil plant biomass plant height leaf chlorophyll nodultions grain and seed yields as well as wue of rain fed soybean increased significantly p 0 05 under the mulching treatments compared to bare soil straw and newspaper mulching increased soybean yield by 12 13 and 6 6 37 2 respectively compared to bare soil the increase was mainly due to 11 44 increase in nodulation 5 7 increase in leaf chlorophyll and 4 34 increase in plant biomass under mulching in two cropping seasons although both the organic mulches provided good results newspaper mulch resulted in lower temperature improved swc greater yield and increased wue therefore newspaper would be an alternative option to straw materials for modifying soil hydro thermal regimes in rain fed soybean cultivation acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the gifu university of japan for
