1915,as an essential state variable of the earth s terrestrial system soil moisture sm is highly significant regarding hydrological processes agricultural production land management in response to issues like soil erosion etc however the net effects of different environmental factors on the heterogeneity and variations of sm remain unclear due to the complex interactions between variables indeed investigating such effects in the highly climate vulnerable mongolian plateau is imperative for water resource management and climate change adaptation in this study we analyzed the contributions of different environmental factors on the spatial heterogeneity and variations of sm in the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 using a geographic detector model gdm and a novel nonlinear granger causality model the results of the gdm analysis demonstrated that precipitation and vegetation were the main controls relevant to sm heterogeneity with their explanatory powers q statistics of gdm found to be higher than 0 67 in two breakpoints one in the early 1990 s and another in 2007 sm demonstrated a pattern of increase then a decrease subsequently followed by an increase insignificant decrease in sm at 100 289 cm depth only precipitation was identified as the granger causal of sm variations over 33 39 97 65 of the plateau s vegetated area leading to the drying up of 40 of its sm the greatest contribution to sm in 28 289 cm of the plateau was observed as coming from one month old precipitation due to the lag in the manifestation of effects further rising temperatures were found to have an immediate influence 2 73 5 23 on sm in 14 61 54 90 of the whole plateau s vegetated area an impact which was relatively high 14 in its northeastern wetting zone vegetation change posed a relatively weak effect 2 on sm over a limited area of the plateau 27 75 35 42 although lesser than the impacts of general climate changes the contributions of climatic extremes could not be neglected ultimately accounting for up to 10 of sm changes in summary this study provides new insights into the individual contributions of various environmental factors on the spatial heterogeneity and variations of sm in the mongolian plateau offering vital information for policymaking regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation sustainable use of water resources and ecological restoration for arid and semi arid region keywords soil moisture mongolian plateau nonlinear granger causality climate change vegetation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a critical component of water resources in the world soil moisture sm serves as a bridge ensuring hydrothermal exchanges between surface water groundwater and atmospheric water luo et al 2021a wang et al 2019 furthermore sm is a determinant of vegetation growth and is recognized as a key factor that necessitates the implementation of vegetation restoration strategies in arid and semi arid regions in addition sm fluctuations reportedly accounts for a large proportion of the declining trend in terrestrial water storage abhishek and kinouchi 2021 abhishek et al 2021 with respect to global warming and excessive human activities the intensification of the global water cycle and the redistribution of water resources have led to considerable uncertainty regarding changes in sm abhishek et al 2021 xiong et al 2022 hence the quantification of sm s spatiotemporal heterogeneity and variation characteristics and the investigation of its relationship with environmental factors have important practical significance for ecological restoration and sustainable development to this end a plethora of studies illustrates that the spatial heterogeneity of sm is jointly affected by climate vegetation topography and soil properties feng et al 2013 meng et al 2022 however no consensus has been achieved on the specific roles and importance of each of these factors that affect the spatial distribution of sm at various scales the spatial heterogeneity of sm is generally considered to be determined by local factors at field scales rosenbaum et al 2012 vanderlinden et al 2012 wang et al 2017 for example chaney et al 2015 suggested that topography and soil type are the most significant factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity of sm in the little river experimental watershed georgia u s a however climate forcing is considered to be the dominant factor driving the spatial heterogeneity of sm at a regional scale in fact cho and choi 2014 indicated that regional meteorological forcing rather than the physical properties of soil is the main driving factor of the spatial heterogeneity of surface sm in the korean peninsula nevertheless inconsistent findings have been obtained regarding the effect of such controls on the spatial heterogeneity of sm franz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 to illustrate unlike cho and choi 2014 wang et al 2017 observed that soil texture rather than meteorological conditions plays a predominant role in the spatial variability of sm in three regions with different climate regimes in the u s a this is a novel finding the main reasons for such conflicting results might be the complex interactions between different drivers of the spatial heterogeneity of sm chaney et al 2015 the temporal resolution and periods of the records gaur and mohanty 2013 gwak and kim 2017 etc also vanderlinden et al 2012 mentioned that the spatial heterogeneity of sm results from the combined long term impacts of the abovementioned driving forces rather than the effect of a single factor moreover the domain factors influencing the spatial heterogeneity of sm at various depths are diverse meng et al 2022 however they have hitherto received less attention therefore the individual effects and complex interactions of the abovementioned driving factors with regard to the spatial heterogeneity of sm need to be further analyzed at regional levels increased attention has also been paid to the driving factors of dynamic changes in sm as the primary meteorological variables changes in precipitation and temperature have been deemed responsible for significantly alterations of sm sm s positive feedback on precipitation and negative feedback on temperature have both been widely demonstrated luo et al 2021b wang et al 2018b yang et al 2017 furthermore complex nonlinear feedback mechanisms reportedly exist between sm and the atmosphere of a given region for example climate change in a region leads to changes in its sm and vice versa tuttle and salvucci 2017 wang et al 2018a this is because sm s memory of the surrounding climate allows it to affect later precipitation and temperature in the region zhou et al 2021 additionally demonstrated that sm contributes to land surface water availability by influencing evapotranspiration and atmospheric moisture inflow especially in arid regions in this regard taking surface sm into account for a coupled land atmosphere climate model reportedly improves the simulation accuracy of precipitation li et al 2014 additionally the sm of an area determines its types of vegetation and their growth status in turn vegetation counteracts sm through bioavailability transpiration etc and alters the infiltration and water storage capacities of the soil ouyang et al 2018 this bidirectional effect complicates the relationship of climate and vegetation with sm therefore quantifying the net and unidirectional effects of the various abovementioned driving factors on sm at different depths remains a challenge although several studies have quantified the driving factors of sm using partial correlation and multiple linear regression analysis these methods are insufficient in light of the two way relationships between the variability of sm and environmental changes salvucci et al 2003 as they are prone to exaggerating the contribution of the latter a commonly used approach in studies on the attribution of variability to environmental factors relevant to sm is the granger causality model attanasio 2012 papagiannopoulou et al 2016 nevertheless this linear model may lead to significant deviations in the estimated impacts of such factors this is because the relationship between changes in sm and environmental factors may be highly nonlinear with respect to climate warming and the concomitant rise in extreme climate events on a related note a study has identified a particular time lag in sm s response to climate luo et al 2021a therefore it is necessary to simultaneously assess the contemporaneous as well as the delayed impacts of both average and extreme climate changes on sm with the development of artificial intelligence technology machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used to explore complex nonlinear causalities in geosciences faghmous and kumar 2014 for instance papagiannopoulou et al 2017 successfully replaced the linear autoregressive model in the granger causality approach with a random forest algorithm and quantified the nonlinear relationship between vegetation and climate change thus based on the above discussion the nonlinear granger causality approach clearly has good application prospects based on its valuable contribution in the exploration of the complex cause effect relationships between sm and its driving factors the mongolian plateau is located in a region with typical arid and semi arid climatic conditions considered the main unit of the temperate steppe of eurasia here sm is the paramount limiting factor related to vegetation growth and restoration as well as ecological environment construction luo et al 2021a an analysis of changes in this plateau s sm and the mechanisms driving these changes can provide an in depth understanding of terrestrial ecosystems responses to changing environmental conditions abhishek and kinouchi 2021 lu et al 2021 in this light several studies have obtained some preliminary results on the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of sm in this plateau luo et al 2021b meng et al 2022 however the complex unidirectional dependency of sm to changes in environmental factors has not been revealed by them to fill this gap regarding the causal relationship between sm and environmental change in the mongolian plateau the unidirectional dependency of sm on environmental factors needs to be determined taking into account both contemporaneous and lag effects hence the objective of this study was to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of and the changes in sm at different layers in the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 and quantify their main driving factors first the main controlling factors of the spatial heterogeneity of sm were quantified based on the geographic detector model gdm and the interactions between these factors were further identified subsequently the characteristic variations of sm were analyzed finally the effects of climate and vegetation including those of antecedent contemporaneous and extreme events on variations in sm were determined using an improved nonlinear granger causality approach compared to previous studies the novel and significant aspects of this study were the following 1 the effects of the primary control factors precipitation temperature and vegetation on sm at different layers of the plateau s vegetated areas could be identified 2 the individual contributions of general climate change climatic extremes and vegetation on sm were separated and 3 the strength of the dependency between sm and environmental factors was determined by both concurrent and lagged effects indeed the results of this study can improve our understanding of atmosphere soil moisture interactions under climate change and provide a scientific theoretical basis for the prevention of drought the restoration of the ecological environment and the sustainable management of water sources in the mongolian plateau 2 study area the mongolian plateau 88 43 126 04 e 37 24 53 23 n comprises the entire territory of mongolia and the inner mongolia autonomous region of china hereafter inner mongolia it covers a land area of approximately 2 75 106 km2 fig 1 the topography of the plateau is complex exhibiting an average elevation of 1580 m above sea level a s l the northwestern part of the plateau is dominated by high mountains whereas its eastern and central parts are covered with hills and relatively flat grasslands and its southwestern part is constituted by the gobi desert the unique topography of this region implies that its vegetation coverage decreases from its northeastern to its southwestern part spanning forest meadow steppe typical steppe desert steppe and the gobi desert luo et al 2021a moreover the plateau has a typical temperate continental climate with annual precipitation and temperature of 233 mm and 1 9 c respectively zhang et al 2020 additionally in the recent decades this region has experienced progressively pronounced climate change 3 datasets and methodologies 3 1 datasets the monthly sm data for the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 was derived from the fifth generation of the european center for medium range weather forecasts interim re analysis era5 the era5 sm with a three hour interval and a 0 1 spatial resolution has actually been available since 1979 it has a four layered soil profile 7 cm 28 cm 100 cm and 289 cm in addition the accuracy of the era5 sm data for the mongolian plateau has been evaluated earlier based on in situ measurements by the international soil moisture network dorigo et al 2013 and has been found to possess the highest reliability compared to those of other commonly used products luo et al 2021a luo et al 2021b therefore the accuracy of the era5 sm was not further examined in this study to represent the state of vegetation in the plateau two types of normalized difference vegetative index ndvi products were collected commonly used long term records were gathered first from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr of the third generation global inventory monitoring and modelling studies gimms 3 g and then from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis product mod13a1 https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov appeears the avhrr gimms ndvi ranged from july 1981 to 2015 with a 0 083 resolution and a 15 day interval while the modis ndvi ranged from 2000 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a 16 day interval the monthly ndvi records of these two products were extracted by employing the maximum value composite approach a linear regression model text s1 figure s1 and s2 was further applied to fuse these two ndvi records to acquire the extended ndvi for the plateau from 1982 to 2020 luo et al 2021a concerning the plateau s climatic factors two different products were considered global unified gauged based analysis data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc and the latest version 4 05 of the climate research unit cru the cpc product was downloaded from the physical sciences laboratory of noaa https psl noaa gov data gridded index html which employs 30 000 stations from multiple sources and has provided the plateau s precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature at 0 5 spatial and daily temporal resolutions since 1979 chen et al 2008 on the other hand the cru 4 05 time series was produced by the cru at the university of east anglia possessing a 0 5 monthly resolution harris et al 2020 this is a gauge interpolated dataset widely used in arid regions guo et al 2018 meng et al 2022 and includes long term precipitation average temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature data since 1901 in order to reduce the considerable uncertainty that might have arisen from a single data source the mean value of these two above products were used in this study plus data on the components of silt sand and clay from the harmonized world soil database version 1 2 hwsd v1 2 with a 1 km spatial resolution were utilized to assess the influence of soil texture on sm other auxiliary data included the vegetation type map and the topographic data specifically the land use cover change lucc data were obtained from the vegetation atlas of the mongolian plateau which had a scale of 1 1000000 bao et al 2014 the digital elevation model dem with a grid size of 90 m 90 m was downloaded from the following website https earthexplorer usgs gov to explore the possible effects of extreme climate on sm two extreme precipitation indices and nine extreme temperature indices were calculated based on the cpc product table s1 to match the spatial resolution of era5 sm all variables from different sources were resampled or interpolated to 0 1 3 2 methodologies 3 2 1 geographic detector model gdm the gdm composed of factor detector ecological detector risk detector and interaction detector is a statistical method used to reveal the driving forces of the spatial heterogeneity of geographical variables wang and xu 2017 it can determine whether the independent variable has an influence on the dependent variable and the magnitude of the impact by detecting whether the spatial distribution of the dependent variable and the independent variable is consistent hu et al 2021b in this research on the mongolian plateau factor and interaction detectors were employed to detect the spatial heterogeneity of sm and the explanatory power of its influencing factors including climate precipitation and temperature vegetation ndvi and lucc topography dem slope and aspect and soil texture the contents of silt sand and clay the factor detector explored the spatial heterogeneity of the dependent variable y and the extent to which the independent variable x explained the spatial heterogeneity of y the explanatory power was determined by the q statistic stated as follows 1 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 1 ssw sst 2 ssw h 1 l n h σ h 2 s s t n σ 2 where h 1 2 l was the stratification of x and y generating 10 stratifications based on a natural breakpoint method table s2 the spatial classifications of the driving factors on the spatial heterogeneity of sm can be found in figure s3 n h and n were the numbers of cells in the stratification h and in the whole region respectively while σ h 2 and σ 2 were the respective variances of the y values in stratification h and in the whole region ssw and sst are the sum of the variance within the layer and the total variance of the region respectively the value range of q was 0 1 the larger the q value the stronger the explanatory power of the independent variable x to the spatial heterogeneity of y the interaction detector identified the interaction between different independent variables in other words it evaluated whether the two factors x1 and x2 enhanced or weakened the explanatory power of the dependent variable y when they worked in conjunction or if the impacts of these two factors on y were independent of each other wu and zhang 2021 according to the q statistic of interaction the interaction results were divided into five categories nonlinear weakening single factor nonlinear weakening bi factor enhancement independent relationship and nonlinear enhancement table s3 3 2 2 break for additive seasonal and trend the break for additive seasonal and trend bfast algorithm is a time series decomposition model which can effectively detect seasonal and trend breakpoints occurring in a time series fang et al 2018 it iteratively decomposes a given time series into a trend term a seasonal term and a residual term 3 y t t t s t t t 1 2 n where y t is the observational data at time step t t t and s t are the long term trend and seasonal terms respectively and t is the residual term by assuming that m breakpoints are detected by the trend term t t denoted as τ 1 τ 2 τ m the trend component t i is piecewise fitted with a linear model geng et al 2019 4 t i α i β i t τ i 1 t τ i i 1 m where α i and β i denote the intercept and slope of the linear model respectively and i is the location of the breakpoint τ 0 0 τ m 1 n in turn the seasonal term s t is segmentally fitted using a periodic model assuming that t 1 t 2 t p is the seasonal mutation point and t 0 0 the seasonal item is expressed as follows 5 s t k 1 k γ k sin 2 π k t f δ k where k is the location of the seasonal mutation point ranging from 1 to p moreover γ k and δ k represent the amplitude and phase respectively while f is the frequency in this study the variations in annual sm were analyzed as the seasonal cycle of the sm was not considered f 1 was adopted 3 2 3 nonlinear granger causality approach proposed by granger in 1969 the granger causality approach based on the predictability theory is used to identify causal relationships between changes in various variables papagiannopoulou et al 2016 as per the basic principle of this method when a time series x t is included as an independent variable to predict y t a significant improvement in the predictability of y t indicates a causal relationship between x t to y t wang et al 2019 to explain the nonlinear relationship between sm s variations and its driving factors the nonlinear granger causality approach can be considered in this study this method replaces the traditional linear vector autoregressive var model used in the granger causality approach with a commonly used nonlinear machine learning model thus enabling the granger causality approach to simulate nonlinear relationships between various environmental variables and sm changes papagiannopoulou et al 2017 therefore in this study a nonlinear granger causality approach based on the random forest model was used to explore the impact mechanisms of climate and vegetation changes on sm in the mongolian plateau hence the time series of sm climate and vegetation with seasonal cycles and long term trends had to be eliminated from the original time series before their application to the nonlinear granger causality approach wang et al 2019 as the granger approach was developed only for stationary time series taking the time series y t as an example a simple linear regression model was adopted initially to eliminate the linear trend of the time series y t the regression equation was expressed as follows 6 y t t a 0 a 1 t 7 y t d y t y t t where a 0 and a 1 denoted the slope and intercept of the regression equation respectively which were calculated by the least squares method y t t represented the predicted series based on the regression equation and y t d represented the series after the removal of the linear variation trend the seasonal cycle y t s obtained by calculating the multi year average of y t d for each month was subtracted from y t d to achieve the final stable time series y t r to this end the following formula was used 8 y t r y t d y t s further the stable time series y t r was used for this study s nonlinear granger causality test the coefficient of determination r2 was introduced to evaluate the forecasting model the r2 was calculated as follows 9 r 2 y y 1 rss tss 1 i p 1 n y i y i 2 i p 1 n y i y 2 where y represent the era5 sm series y is the predicted sm series and y is the mean value of y n and p are the lengths of time series and lag time moving window respectively generally the causality approach is usually performed using two variables however ignoring other primary influencing variables may lead to inaccurate results papagiannopoulou et al 2016 therefore in this study additional variables were also considered in building the forecast model which was used to decide whether x was the granger causal of y more specifically the sm time series was regarded as the response variable y t whereas precipitation temperature and ndvi were used as the predictor variables defined in this study as x t z t and w t respectively the established forecast model composed of four parts and predicting y t at time t i xt p xt p 1 xt ii yt p yt p 1 yt 1 iii zt p zt p 1 zt and iv wt p wt p 1 wt was defined as the full model all drivers are considered for example to explore whether precipitation was the granger causal of sm the predictor x t had to be removed from the established full model which was in turn defined as the precipitation excluded model the full model and precipitation excluded model were defined as follows 10 y t r f y t 1 r y t p r x t r x t p r z t r z t p r w t r w t p r ε 11 y t r 0 f 0 y t 1 r y t p r z t r z t p r w t r w t p r ε where ε is the error term f represents the full model to predict y t r using the information of all driving factors while f 0 represents the precipitation excluded model to predict y t r using the information without precipitation the difference in r2 between the full model and the precipitation excluded model was appraised as the contribution of precipitation to sm changes considering the lagged effects of the explanatory factors time series with 1 6 months lags p 6 of the predictors were added while establishing this study s prediction model moreover the extreme indices of climate as shown in table s1 and their lagged variables were also considered combining all the records described above 111 predictor variables were considered in this study s full model furthermore the random forest model which solely used the past values of sm for predicting sm was defined as the basic model therefore the improved r2 of the full model relative to the basic model was considered as providing the cumulative granger causals of precipitation temperature and ndvi with respect to sm changes in addition the number of predictor variables per node mtry and the number of regression trees ntree of the random forest model were set as one fifth of the total number of variables and 100 respectively five folds cross validation was further adopted to assess the performance of the full model papagiannopoulou et al 2016 4 results 4 1 the explanatory power of different factors regarding the spatial heterogeneity of sm strong spatial heterogeneity was found in the distribution of sm throughout the mongolian plateau which ranged from 0 07 to 0 43 m 3 m 3 in its vegetated area figure s4 generally sm at different layers of the plateau had a similar spatial distribution gradually decreasing from its northeastern to its southwestern parts the explanatory powers of different factors regarding the spatial heterogeneity of sm in the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 were determined based on the gdm fig 2 in addition to the surface 0 7 cm sm precipitation was found to possess the strongest explanatory power regarding the spatial heterogeneity of sm followed by ndvi and lucc concerning the heterogeneity of sm at surface layer ndvi possessed the strongest explanatory power followed by precipitation and lucc plus the q statistics of all these three factors were higher than 0 67 indicating that precipitation and vegetation conditions played a dominant role in the spatial heterogeneity of the plateau s sm the spatial distributions of precipitation and ndvi were also quite similar to that of sm in the plateau figure s5 consistent with the aforementioned findings moreover the explanatory powers of these three driving factors were found to possibly become less profound with the increase in soil depth meanwhile temperature was ranked fourth in terms of its explanatory power with the respective q ranging from 0 44 to 0 55 at different sm layers this finding unequivocally showed that water precipitation conditions had a broader and more significant influence on the heterogeneity of the plateau s sm compared with thermal temperature conditions the remaining topographic and soil texture factors were less significant for sm heterogeneity than climate and vegetation conditions with the concomitant values of q being less than 0 3 among the topographic elements the explanatory power of slope was significantly higher than those of elevation and aspect a larger slope was more favorable for sm infiltration and transfer from shallow to deep layers while the q of the slope also surged with the increase in soil depth however the soil textures including the contents of silt sand and clay often related to a soil s water holding capacity were not found to be a crucial factor of the spatial heterogeneity of sm in the mongolian plateau it had relatively less explanatory power with the related q values being less than 0 18 among different kinds of soil textures silt possessed the highest explanatory power at different layers of the plateau s soil followed by sand and clay further the interactions between different factors strengthened the explanatory power of the spatial heterogeneity of sm based on the results of interaction detection all interactions between these factors depicted functions of bi factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement fig 3 although aspect demonstrated extremely limited explanatory power it consistently presented a nonlinear enhancement of the effects on spatial heterogeneity of the plateau s sm while interacting with other factors the combined effects of different topographic variables and soil texture factors also presented such a nonlinear enhancement additionally temperature demonstrated a nonlinear enhancement in the heterogeneity of the plateau s sm while interacting with certain topographic and soil texture factors meanwhile interactions of other factors were expressed as bi factor enhancements more specially the interaction between precipitation and temperature demonstrated the highest explanatory power 0 86 0 89 followed by the interactions between precipitation and dem ndvi and temperature and precipitation and lucc the explanatory powers of these interactions between different variables exceeded 0 81 at different sm layers 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of sm dynamics in the mongolian plateau in line with the warmer and drier trend in the climate of the mongolian plateau its sm at all four layers presented a significant downward trend p less than 0 05 between 1982 and 2020 based on the results of sen s slope and mann kendall test text s2 the decreasing rates of sm were found to be 0 00101 0 00105 0 00124 and 0 00106 m 3 m 3 year 1 at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm respectively fig 4 locations demonstrating a decreasing trend of sm at all four layers from shallow to deep accounted for 95 84 94 23 91 46 and 92 41 of the total plateau s vegetated area respectively and the decreasing trend in most of these locations passed the 95 significance test fig 5 moreover the breakpoint detected results suggested that sm at all four layers experienced two changes in trend based on the bfast method figure s6 the first breakpoints of sm from shallow to deep layers occurred in 1994 1992 1993 and 1995 whereas the second breakpoint of sm occurred in 2007 at all four layers hence the study period was divided into three periods owing to two breakpoints these two breakpoints divided the sm change process at top three layers 0 100 cm into three stages increase decrease and then increase again meanwhile the sm at 100 289 cm presented a pattern of significant increase 1982 1995 followed by a significant decrease 1996 2007 and thereafter an insignificant increase 2008 2020 moreover the interannual fluctuation of the plateau s sm at 100 289 cm was significantly less than that of the sm at the three relatively upper layers presumably due to surface water and heat exchange processes having a lower influence on the plateau s sm at the deeper layers from the perspective of spatial distribution mainly an increasing trend in sm was observed before the first breakpoint throughout the mongolian plateau apart from its northeastern and central parts fig 5 the proportion of regions exhibiting this increasing trend was about 58 17 73 46 of the plateau area following the first breakpoint until 2007 soil desiccation was prevalent in 86 98 69 of the plateau s vegetated area especially in its northeastern and northwestern regions where soil desiccation was significant areas with increased sm were few and mainly distributed in the mountainous regions of northwestern and central mongolia this finding reflected that soil drying at this sub stage was the main reason behind the decline in the plateau s sm between 1982 and 2020 after 2007 soil desiccation at a depth of 0 100 cm decelerated and the soil regained moisture the moisture recovered area accounted for 63 82 80 39 of the plateau s vegetated area however sm at 100 289 cm in 61 26 of the plateau except for its northeastern northwestern and southwestern regions still exhibited a decreasing trend while the decline speed obviously decreased in the entire study period sm exhibited an increasing trend in only a small part of the southwestern mongolian plateau 4 16 8 54 while other areas particularly the northwest and southeast regions of the mongolian plateau experienced a significant decrease in sm 4 3 distinguishing and quantifying the driving factors of sm variability as shown in fig 6 the full nonlinear granger model of this study explained up to 97 of the sm changes in the mongolian plateau r 2 0 97 the r 2 of the full model progressed from the shallow to deep layers of the plateau s soil due to the largely increased r 2 of the basic model except for most deserts and typical steppes at 100 289 cm the previous conditions of sm at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm were able to explain 17 98 34 12 62 44 and 44 60 of sm variability on average based on the basic model this result indicated that the contributions of the forecasting model substantially increased when considering the antecedent conditions of sm itself to test the nonlinear granger causals of changes in climate and vegetation on the plateau s sm the concomitant differences between the full model and basic model were calculated the results unequivocally indicated a decrease in the contributions of climate and vegetation changes on sm upon an increase in soil depth in particular for sm at 100 289 cm the regions where sm variations had been granger caused by changes in climate and vegetation were found to be quite limited mainly located in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the plateau indeed the contribution of the sm cycle itself to sm change at a deep layer was always so high that the difference between the full model and the basic model was deemed minimal the average contributions of climate and vegetation were found to be 34 59 21 43 7 73 and 6 85 for sm changes at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm respectively to detect the nonlinear granger causal relationships between changes in sm and its different driving factors in the mongolian plateau the net effects of precipitation temperature and ndvi on sm changes were distinguished a nonlinear granger causal of these three variables precipitation temperature and vegetation with respect to sm at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm and 28 100 cm was observed over 99 97 99 42 and 92 26 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively fig 7 in addition for most of the regions where the nonlinear granger causals of sm were discovered sm at the three upper layers appeared to be primarily controlled by precipitation with the largest proportion of temperature and vegetation dominant areas amounting to only 5 43 of the entire plateau regarding the sm anomalies at 100 289 cm the three abovementioned driving factors variables demonstrated an influence on about 54 02 of the plateau s vegetated area additionally at 100 289 cm no granger causality r 2 0 between precipitation and sm changes was observed over about 45 98 of the plateau s vegetated area mainly covered by typical steppe and desert steppe moreover temperature and vegetation were deemed the most important driving factors contributing to sm changes at 100 289 cm in 8 60 and 12 04 of plateau s vegetated area respectively the aforementioned results implied that with increasing soil depth the area primarily controlled by precipitation decreased accompanied by an increase in the area primarily controlled by temperature and vegetation more specially precipitation was found to be the primary controlling factor regarding sm changes in 33 39 97 65 of the plateau s vegetated area while temperature and vegetation were the most important limiting factors for 2 32 20 64 of its vegetated area additionally up to 40 of the plateau s sm changes could be explained by precipitation especially the sm at top two 0 28 cm soil layers in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the plateau fig 8 the effects of precipitation weakened distinctly with the increase in soil depth with the concomitantly affected regions accounting for 99 92 99 03 88 35 and 43 05 of the plateau s vegetated area areas with remarkable precipitation related effects on sm below 28 cm were mainly located in the high altitude regions in the northern part of the mongolian plateau meanwhile temperature explained 0 14 of sm changes in the mongolian plateau which was remarkable considering the two upper soil layers in northeastern inner mongolia the regions where temperature played a most dominant role in sm at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm accounted for 2 30 1 63 5 43 and 8 6 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively also the plateau areas affected by temperature evidently decreased in proportion with an increase in soil depth apart from sm at the surface layer 54 90 the regions where temperature was deemed the nonlinear granger causal of sm were found to be less than 30 14 61 27 25 of the plateau s vegetated area further sm was found to be granger caused by ndvi in only 27 75 36 61 of the plateau s vegetated areas with an average ndvi contribution of less than 3 the areas where ndvi became the most important limiting factor for sm at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm accounted for 0 02 0 34 3 60 and 12 04 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively as the intensity and scope of the sm change nonlinear granger caused by ndvi were minute they could serve as regulators for sm changes 4 4 quantifying the time lagged effects of climate change on sm regarding the sm s memory of climate change the latency in sm response to climate and vegetation needed to be explored as well as the contributions of ndvi to sm variability was quite limited in the plateau the lagged effects of ndvi were not discussed further generally the concurrent precipitation lag 0 demonstrated the strongest contribution for surface sm changes particularly prominent in areas with extreme sm scarcity such as the southwestern part of the mongolian plateau fig 9 on another note 17 3 of sm changes at the surface layer of the plateau s soil could be explained by contemporaneous precipitation in 99 84 of its vegetated areas the lagged effects of changes in precipitation on surface sm were thoroughly limited on a monthly scale with the average contributions of antecedent precipitation being less than 1 17 in about 53 87 67 98 of the study area these results indicated that the effects of precipitation on the plateau s surface sm were immediate and dissipated rapidly although less than the influences of contemporaneous precipitation one month antecedent precipitation still explained 0 14 65 of the subsurface 7 28 cm sm changes in 93 14 of the study area interestingly the amount of precipitation in the previous month lag 1 contributed more to sm at 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm than that in the concurrent month indicating sm s higher resistance to water conditions in the soil s deep layers this phenomenon was not reported previously and emphasized the importance of considering the lag effect of climate change in this study the sm changes at 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm were influenced by one month antecedent precipitation in about 87 33 and 43 02 of the plateau s total area respectively demonstrating this precipitation s concomitant average contributions of 3 2 and 1 98 respectively the influences of precipitation to sm at deeper layers lasted even longer than three months in a few regions though this phenomenon was accompanied by a gradual weakening of the lagged effects fig 10 shows the lagged effects of temperature on sm in the mongolian plateau to elaborate concurrent temperature affected surface and subsurface sm changes in 92 51 and 77 70 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively with the accompanying average contributions being 3 62 and 2 29 respectively surface and subsurface sm changes were nonlinear granger caused by antecedent temperature in about 36 80 57 23 of the plateau s vegetated area with its average contributions being less than 1 0 73 0 93 this indicated the short term memory of sm regarding temperature at the shallow layers plus no apparent changes were observed in the effects of temperature on sm at 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm for various monthly time lags generally zero month one month two month and three month antecedent temperature contributed to sm at 28 100 cm in 51 13 57 54 44 61 and 44 19 of the study area respectively while their average contributions were found to be 1 36 1 22 1 09 and 1 05 respectively the intensity and the scope of temperature determined sm changes at 100 289 cm reduced gradually relative to sm at 28 100 cm also notable was the fact that the effects of temperature on sm at deeper soil layers were relatively weak but durable compared to its effects on sm at shallower layers 4 5 quantifying the effects of climate extremes on sm to explore the effects of climate extremes on sm changes in the mongolian plateau the individual effects of extreme precipitation and temperature were also quantified fig 11 unlike the effects of general precipitation no apparent differences were observed in the effects of the two extreme precipitation indices selected in this study especially on sm at the top three layers the average contributions of extreme precipitation were 1 08 1 24 1 28 and 1 81 on sm from the surface to the deeper layers while the concomitantly affected areas accounted for 56 75 58 07 50 29 and 33 88 of the vegetated area in the plateau respectively plus on a spatial average nine extreme temperature indices respectively explained 2 43 2 53 2 11 and 3 55 of sm changes at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm of depth whereas the main limited areas r2 10 varied for different layers the areas in which extreme temperatures grange caused sm changes accounted for 39 05 25 41 25 87 and 16 84 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively and were distributed mainly around northeastern inner mongolia for sm at 0 28 cm and sporadically around northwestern mongolia and northeastern inner mongolia for sm at 28 289 cm 5 discussion 5 1 influencing factors on spatial heterogeneity of sm in the mongolian plateau the analysis of sm distribution in the mongolian plateau suggested the existence of a strong spatial heterogeneity the main influencing factors i e precipitation ndvi and lucc explained the spatial heterogeneity of sm lesser with an increase in soil depth this finding could be attributed to the spatial distribution of sm at deep layers being more stable while the sm at shallow layers remained more susceptible to random changes in external conditions zhao et al 2017 as the most important source of sm precipitation was unsurprisingly found to possess the highest explanatory power for the spatial heterogeneity of sm at 7 289 cm however ndvi was observed to be the most significant driving factor of sm heterogeneity at the surface layer while the explanatory power of precipitation regarding surface sm was ranked second still higher than its explanatory power regarding sm at 7 289 cm the possible reason for this finding could be the following the annual amount of light precipitation less than5 mm in the mongolian plateau accounted for a larger proportion of total precipitation than the annual amounts of moderate and heavy precipitation which were even higher than 80 in some of the plateau s regions yuan et al 2015 light precipitation preferentially replenished sm at the shallow layer which was more rapidly absorbed and easily utilized by herbaceous plants cheng et al 2006 the ndvi of grasslands also appeared to have a higher correlation with light precipitation yuan et al 2015 also the fact that different vegetation types sm demands and water absorption by roots vary deng et al 2016 could be another important reason why vegetation types were found to have a considerable impact on the spatial heterogeneity of sm meng et al 2022 wang et al 2019 meanwhile the contributions of temperature to sm heterogeneity were above 40 q 0 4 by affecting the evapotranspiration process temperature determined the amount of water loss of the plateau s soil stefanon et al 2014 in agreement with the previous findings of meng et al 2022 topography and soil properties contributed less to sm heterogeneity in the mongolian plateau than climate and vegetation while complex interactions between these variables were suggested the interactions between topography and soil textures preferred a nonlinear enhancement indicating that soil properties topographical parameters were able to significantly influence sm under certain terrain soil property conditions aspect in particular exhibited nonlinear enhancement while interacting with other factors indeed lee and kim 2017 also indicated that the relationship between sm variability and precipitation fluctuated with regard to different aspects therefore future studies should consider the links between the different drivers of spatial heterogeneity in sm 5 2 main driving factors on sm dynamics in the mongolian plateau over the past 39 years the mongolian plateau s sm significantly decreased consistent with the warmer and drier trend in its climate tao et al 2015 two breakpoints were present in the trends of the plateau s annual sm around 1992 and 2007 importantly the plateau s soil desiccation over the past 39 years was primarily caused by the significant decreases in its sm from 1993 to 2007 as confirmed by fig 4 consistent with this study s findings meng et al 2022 analyzed the effects of different environmental factors on sm variability in the mongolian plateau discovering that precipitation remained the main control for its sm changes between 1982 and 2019 with same pattern of first increasing then decreasing and then increasing again lu et al 2021 found that the mongolian plateau experienced a severely dry period from 2000 to 2018 and its vegetation productivity was the lowest in 2007 in line with the resulting breakpoint in sm in 2007 that was found by the current study a severe drought in 2007 was also discovered by wei et al 2022 taking into account the shifts in and the dynamics of sm that may have been introduced by the above driving factors the associated changes in climate and vegetation were further explored in this study according to the time of the breakpoints the study period was divided into three smaller periods phase i 1982 1992 phase ii 1993 2007 and phase iii 2008 2020 as per figure s7 precipitation displayed the same change trend as that of sm at 0 100 cm in each period while the temperature always exhibited an upward trend figure s7 interestingly vegetation had the same trend as that of sm at 0 100 cm throughout the three sub stages but its trend was opposite to that of sm when considering the whole period hence this study claims that the breakpoints regarding sm in the mongolian plateau were expected to be mainly associated with the dynamics of precipitation from the perspective of space the spatial distribution of precipitation dynamics was also quite similar to that of sm figure s8 further confirming the abovementioned view although increased precipitation did not lead to increases in sm at 100 289 cm after 2007 it obviously slowed down the decreasing rate of sm fig 4 except the decreased precipitation the consistently increased temperature was another prominent reason behind the reduction in the plateau s sm owing to increasing evapotranspiration figure s9 displays the obvious negative relationship between temperature and sm throughout most of the plateau however the low sm of its arid and semi arid regions constrained evapotranspiration conversely wang et al 2019 thus resulting in relatively lower effects of temperature on the plateau s sm the statistical results also revealed uneven spatiotemporal changes in vegetation greenness at 0 001 a as reported by jasechko et al 2013 vegetation expansion would accelerate sm drying in an arid region with the possible reason being the influence of vegetation on evapotranspiration this could explain a part of the sm drying in the plateau the quantitation of the granger causes of climate and vegetation with regard to sm changes based on an improved nonlinear granger causality approach depicted that sm changes at the top layer in the mongolian plateau were primarily controlled by precipitation temperature and vegetation in 97 65 2 30 and 0 03 of its vegetated area respectively these results could be compared with the findings of wang et al 2019 who reported the most dominant role of precipitation 87 in xinjiang china another typical arid and semi arid region close to our study region moreover gazis and feng 2004 pointed out that the contributions of precipitation gradually decreased with the increase in a given soil depth also in agreement with the findings of our study as discussed earlier only heavy precipitation events were able to replenish the plateau s sm at deeper layers cheng et al 2006 as most of the light precipitation was intercepted and could not infiltrate into the deeper layers of soil tashie et al 2016 song et al 2019 found the correlations between precipitation and sm to be closer at shallow soil layers compared to deeper layers in the desert steppe of inner mongolia additionally extremely heavy precipitation was considered as playing a significant role in determining the amount of sm at deep soil layers with the results displayed in fig 11 further proving that extreme precipitation presented effects on sm at deep layers that were comparable with its effects on sm at shallow layers however the importance of extreme precipitation was lower compared to general precipitation due to the former s infrequency in the plateau papagiannopoulou et al 2017 nevertheless snow cover could be considered as an important water source in the mongolian plateau sa et al 2021 indeed potopová et al 2016 found that snow water equivalent explained up to 45 of soil moisture variability during the early summer season also shallow groundwater was reported as an important source of sm recharge at a deeper layer in arid regions rao et al 2020 and spatiotemporal variations in the groundwater level directly affected the distribution characteristics of sm at such a deeper layer chen et al 2007 in future studies the dependence of sm on snow cover as well as groundwater will be included to better reveal the causes of changes in sm at deep layer similarly a decreasing negative relationship was identified between temperature and sm with regard to increase in soil depth in most of the study area this could be attributed to the high temperatures leading to direct moisture evaporation from the surface of the soil cho and choi 2014 the insights from fig 8 revealed that the contribution of vegetation to variabilities in sm was limited less than 3 in 27 75 36 61 of the plateau s vegetated area this discovery agreed with the findings of feng 2016 who emphasized a relatively weak and negative influence of vegetation change on sm because of the limited areas over which vegetation occurs in terms of lag effects with the exception of sm at the two upper layers 0 28 cm one month antecedent precipitation had highest contributions to sm changes previous studies revealed that the effect of precipitation on sm at deep layers displayed a time lag ranging from one to three months hu et al 2021a varikoden and revadekar 2017 since precipitation took time to permeate into the soil and convert to sm at deep layers moreover the differences of convert times were relevant to the degree of development of the plateau s vegetation root system the infiltration capacity of its soil the initial water content of its soil etc gao et al 2014 jin et al 2018 mcnamara et al 2005 zhu et al 2021 these findings suggested that the incorporation of the lag effects into a dynamic sm modelling could improve the accuracy of sm quantification effectively in support wu et al 2015 also emphasized that considering only contemporaneous effects would largely underestimate the effects of climate change moreover the effects of temperature on sm were found to be more immediate maximum effect at lag 0 compared to those of precipitation in line with the results of wang et al 2019 the immediate response of sm to temperature could be attributed to the adaptive strategies of sm the regulation of evapotranspiration 5 3 implications and uncertainties of the study this study sheds light on the effects of climate and vegetation conditions on sm variability based on an improved nonlinear granger causality approach going a step beyond the commonly used statistical analysis e g correlation analysis of the drivers of sm variability all simultaneous delayed and extreme events effects of climate change on sm variability are quantified and distinguished simultaneously providing a more systematic understanding of the drivers of sm changes however we should declare that since the contribution of a particular driver to sm changes is calculated by subtracting it from the full model of this study its causal effect on sm may be underestimated if the remaining drivers are highly correlated to the one that is subtracted correspondingly the contribution r2 is explained as a unique causal relationship of the particular driver that is subtracted that cannot be explained by remaining drivers in the full model in addition a few uncertainties in this study must be addressed by future research first the granger causal relationships between the various driving factors and sm variability in the mongolian plateau should be significantly different owing to the presence of permafrost and snow cover at its high altitudes the characteristics of this aspect are not yet clear second due to the unfeasibility of including all the possible driving factors of sm anomalies the contributions computed by r 2 are not sufficiently accurate third given that the hydrothermal condition in the mongolian plateau has a strong heterogeneity an evaluation must be conducted to determine whether this heterogeneity is directly related to the contributions of driving factors to sm changes finally it is important to note that the resulting contributions of these drivers are influenced by the length of the study period the parameters of the model the spatial resolution and accuracy of the data etc which may lead to the differences with the findings of other studies therefore reducing these uncertainties in the results is a challenge for future work on this topic 6 conclusions in this study we identify the contributions of different environmental factors to the heterogeneity and variability of sm at different layers in the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 the results can be summarized as follows 1 the spatial distribution of sm at various layers in the mongolian plateau is characterized by high sm in its northeastern part and low sm in its southwestern region which can be mainly attributed to differences in precipitation ndvi and lucc complex interactions are observed between different driving factors mainly manifesting as bi factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement 2 two breakpoints in early 1990 s and 2007 have resulted in the plateau s sm change process displaying a characteristic of increase decrease and then increase again slower decrease at 0 100 cm 100 289 cm mainly attributable to the significant downward trend of the plateau s sm since the early 1990 s to 2007 its sm at all four layers has displayed a widespread drying trend in 91 46 95 84 of its vegetated area between 1982 and 2020 3 precipitation is the primary driving factor influencing 33 39 97 65 of the plateau s vegetated area and explains up to 40 of sm changes in about 43 05 99 92 of its vegetated area temperature explains 2 73 5 23 of sm changes in 14 61 54 90 of its vegetated area while vegetation explains less than 3 of sm changes in 27 75 36 61 of its vegetated area the contributions of climate and vegetation on sm decrease with increases in soil depth 4 sm has a longer memory of precipitation compared with temperature the precipitation of the previous month lag 1 demonstrate greater contributions to the plateau s sm changes at 28 289 cm than that of the concurrent month while the contributions of temperature decrease gradually with regard to the increases in lag times the contributions of climatic extremes to sm changes are less than those of the regular climate conditions in summary our study reveals the unidirectional dependency of sm on environmental factors in the mongolian plateau thereby improving our understanding of the key factors driving the spatial heterogeneity of and changes in its regional sm some of our calculation procedures and results can also be applied in other studies in addition the primary drivers of sm changes may shift according to different seasons due to the intra annual variability of the mongolian plateau s climate as well as the plateau s plant phenological cycles which can be further compared yet future studies on the bidirectional dependency between the plateau s sm and the related environmental factors must attempt to reveal the underlying mechanisms of its sm responses and feedbacks with regard to changes in

1915,as an essential state variable of the earth s terrestrial system soil moisture sm is highly significant regarding hydrological processes agricultural production land management in response to issues like soil erosion etc however the net effects of different environmental factors on the heterogeneity and variations of sm remain unclear due to the complex interactions between variables indeed investigating such effects in the highly climate vulnerable mongolian plateau is imperative for water resource management and climate change adaptation in this study we analyzed the contributions of different environmental factors on the spatial heterogeneity and variations of sm in the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 using a geographic detector model gdm and a novel nonlinear granger causality model the results of the gdm analysis demonstrated that precipitation and vegetation were the main controls relevant to sm heterogeneity with their explanatory powers q statistics of gdm found to be higher than 0 67 in two breakpoints one in the early 1990 s and another in 2007 sm demonstrated a pattern of increase then a decrease subsequently followed by an increase insignificant decrease in sm at 100 289 cm depth only precipitation was identified as the granger causal of sm variations over 33 39 97 65 of the plateau s vegetated area leading to the drying up of 40 of its sm the greatest contribution to sm in 28 289 cm of the plateau was observed as coming from one month old precipitation due to the lag in the manifestation of effects further rising temperatures were found to have an immediate influence 2 73 5 23 on sm in 14 61 54 90 of the whole plateau s vegetated area an impact which was relatively high 14 in its northeastern wetting zone vegetation change posed a relatively weak effect 2 on sm over a limited area of the plateau 27 75 35 42 although lesser than the impacts of general climate changes the contributions of climatic extremes could not be neglected ultimately accounting for up to 10 of sm changes in summary this study provides new insights into the individual contributions of various environmental factors on the spatial heterogeneity and variations of sm in the mongolian plateau offering vital information for policymaking regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation sustainable use of water resources and ecological restoration for arid and semi arid region keywords soil moisture mongolian plateau nonlinear granger causality climate change vegetation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a critical component of water resources in the world soil moisture sm serves as a bridge ensuring hydrothermal exchanges between surface water groundwater and atmospheric water luo et al 2021a wang et al 2019 furthermore sm is a determinant of vegetation growth and is recognized as a key factor that necessitates the implementation of vegetation restoration strategies in arid and semi arid regions in addition sm fluctuations reportedly accounts for a large proportion of the declining trend in terrestrial water storage abhishek and kinouchi 2021 abhishek et al 2021 with respect to global warming and excessive human activities the intensification of the global water cycle and the redistribution of water resources have led to considerable uncertainty regarding changes in sm abhishek et al 2021 xiong et al 2022 hence the quantification of sm s spatiotemporal heterogeneity and variation characteristics and the investigation of its relationship with environmental factors have important practical significance for ecological restoration and sustainable development to this end a plethora of studies illustrates that the spatial heterogeneity of sm is jointly affected by climate vegetation topography and soil properties feng et al 2013 meng et al 2022 however no consensus has been achieved on the specific roles and importance of each of these factors that affect the spatial distribution of sm at various scales the spatial heterogeneity of sm is generally considered to be determined by local factors at field scales rosenbaum et al 2012 vanderlinden et al 2012 wang et al 2017 for example chaney et al 2015 suggested that topography and soil type are the most significant factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity of sm in the little river experimental watershed georgia u s a however climate forcing is considered to be the dominant factor driving the spatial heterogeneity of sm at a regional scale in fact cho and choi 2014 indicated that regional meteorological forcing rather than the physical properties of soil is the main driving factor of the spatial heterogeneity of surface sm in the korean peninsula nevertheless inconsistent findings have been obtained regarding the effect of such controls on the spatial heterogeneity of sm franz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 to illustrate unlike cho and choi 2014 wang et al 2017 observed that soil texture rather than meteorological conditions plays a predominant role in the spatial variability of sm in three regions with different climate regimes in the u s a this is a novel finding the main reasons for such conflicting results might be the complex interactions between different drivers of the spatial heterogeneity of sm chaney et al 2015 the temporal resolution and periods of the records gaur and mohanty 2013 gwak and kim 2017 etc also vanderlinden et al 2012 mentioned that the spatial heterogeneity of sm results from the combined long term impacts of the abovementioned driving forces rather than the effect of a single factor moreover the domain factors influencing the spatial heterogeneity of sm at various depths are diverse meng et al 2022 however they have hitherto received less attention therefore the individual effects and complex interactions of the abovementioned driving factors with regard to the spatial heterogeneity of sm need to be further analyzed at regional levels increased attention has also been paid to the driving factors of dynamic changes in sm as the primary meteorological variables changes in precipitation and temperature have been deemed responsible for significantly alterations of sm sm s positive feedback on precipitation and negative feedback on temperature have both been widely demonstrated luo et al 2021b wang et al 2018b yang et al 2017 furthermore complex nonlinear feedback mechanisms reportedly exist between sm and the atmosphere of a given region for example climate change in a region leads to changes in its sm and vice versa tuttle and salvucci 2017 wang et al 2018a this is because sm s memory of the surrounding climate allows it to affect later precipitation and temperature in the region zhou et al 2021 additionally demonstrated that sm contributes to land surface water availability by influencing evapotranspiration and atmospheric moisture inflow especially in arid regions in this regard taking surface sm into account for a coupled land atmosphere climate model reportedly improves the simulation accuracy of precipitation li et al 2014 additionally the sm of an area determines its types of vegetation and their growth status in turn vegetation counteracts sm through bioavailability transpiration etc and alters the infiltration and water storage capacities of the soil ouyang et al 2018 this bidirectional effect complicates the relationship of climate and vegetation with sm therefore quantifying the net and unidirectional effects of the various abovementioned driving factors on sm at different depths remains a challenge although several studies have quantified the driving factors of sm using partial correlation and multiple linear regression analysis these methods are insufficient in light of the two way relationships between the variability of sm and environmental changes salvucci et al 2003 as they are prone to exaggerating the contribution of the latter a commonly used approach in studies on the attribution of variability to environmental factors relevant to sm is the granger causality model attanasio 2012 papagiannopoulou et al 2016 nevertheless this linear model may lead to significant deviations in the estimated impacts of such factors this is because the relationship between changes in sm and environmental factors may be highly nonlinear with respect to climate warming and the concomitant rise in extreme climate events on a related note a study has identified a particular time lag in sm s response to climate luo et al 2021a therefore it is necessary to simultaneously assess the contemporaneous as well as the delayed impacts of both average and extreme climate changes on sm with the development of artificial intelligence technology machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used to explore complex nonlinear causalities in geosciences faghmous and kumar 2014 for instance papagiannopoulou et al 2017 successfully replaced the linear autoregressive model in the granger causality approach with a random forest algorithm and quantified the nonlinear relationship between vegetation and climate change thus based on the above discussion the nonlinear granger causality approach clearly has good application prospects based on its valuable contribution in the exploration of the complex cause effect relationships between sm and its driving factors the mongolian plateau is located in a region with typical arid and semi arid climatic conditions considered the main unit of the temperate steppe of eurasia here sm is the paramount limiting factor related to vegetation growth and restoration as well as ecological environment construction luo et al 2021a an analysis of changes in this plateau s sm and the mechanisms driving these changes can provide an in depth understanding of terrestrial ecosystems responses to changing environmental conditions abhishek and kinouchi 2021 lu et al 2021 in this light several studies have obtained some preliminary results on the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of sm in this plateau luo et al 2021b meng et al 2022 however the complex unidirectional dependency of sm to changes in environmental factors has not been revealed by them to fill this gap regarding the causal relationship between sm and environmental change in the mongolian plateau the unidirectional dependency of sm on environmental factors needs to be determined taking into account both contemporaneous and lag effects hence the objective of this study was to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of and the changes in sm at different layers in the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 and quantify their main driving factors first the main controlling factors of the spatial heterogeneity of sm were quantified based on the geographic detector model gdm and the interactions between these factors were further identified subsequently the characteristic variations of sm were analyzed finally the effects of climate and vegetation including those of antecedent contemporaneous and extreme events on variations in sm were determined using an improved nonlinear granger causality approach compared to previous studies the novel and significant aspects of this study were the following 1 the effects of the primary control factors precipitation temperature and vegetation on sm at different layers of the plateau s vegetated areas could be identified 2 the individual contributions of general climate change climatic extremes and vegetation on sm were separated and 3 the strength of the dependency between sm and environmental factors was determined by both concurrent and lagged effects indeed the results of this study can improve our understanding of atmosphere soil moisture interactions under climate change and provide a scientific theoretical basis for the prevention of drought the restoration of the ecological environment and the sustainable management of water sources in the mongolian plateau 2 study area the mongolian plateau 88 43 126 04 e 37 24 53 23 n comprises the entire territory of mongolia and the inner mongolia autonomous region of china hereafter inner mongolia it covers a land area of approximately 2 75 106 km2 fig 1 the topography of the plateau is complex exhibiting an average elevation of 1580 m above sea level a s l the northwestern part of the plateau is dominated by high mountains whereas its eastern and central parts are covered with hills and relatively flat grasslands and its southwestern part is constituted by the gobi desert the unique topography of this region implies that its vegetation coverage decreases from its northeastern to its southwestern part spanning forest meadow steppe typical steppe desert steppe and the gobi desert luo et al 2021a moreover the plateau has a typical temperate continental climate with annual precipitation and temperature of 233 mm and 1 9 c respectively zhang et al 2020 additionally in the recent decades this region has experienced progressively pronounced climate change 3 datasets and methodologies 3 1 datasets the monthly sm data for the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 was derived from the fifth generation of the european center for medium range weather forecasts interim re analysis era5 the era5 sm with a three hour interval and a 0 1 spatial resolution has actually been available since 1979 it has a four layered soil profile 7 cm 28 cm 100 cm and 289 cm in addition the accuracy of the era5 sm data for the mongolian plateau has been evaluated earlier based on in situ measurements by the international soil moisture network dorigo et al 2013 and has been found to possess the highest reliability compared to those of other commonly used products luo et al 2021a luo et al 2021b therefore the accuracy of the era5 sm was not further examined in this study to represent the state of vegetation in the plateau two types of normalized difference vegetative index ndvi products were collected commonly used long term records were gathered first from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr of the third generation global inventory monitoring and modelling studies gimms 3 g and then from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis product mod13a1 https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov appeears the avhrr gimms ndvi ranged from july 1981 to 2015 with a 0 083 resolution and a 15 day interval while the modis ndvi ranged from 2000 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a 16 day interval the monthly ndvi records of these two products were extracted by employing the maximum value composite approach a linear regression model text s1 figure s1 and s2 was further applied to fuse these two ndvi records to acquire the extended ndvi for the plateau from 1982 to 2020 luo et al 2021a concerning the plateau s climatic factors two different products were considered global unified gauged based analysis data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc and the latest version 4 05 of the climate research unit cru the cpc product was downloaded from the physical sciences laboratory of noaa https psl noaa gov data gridded index html which employs 30 000 stations from multiple sources and has provided the plateau s precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature at 0 5 spatial and daily temporal resolutions since 1979 chen et al 2008 on the other hand the cru 4 05 time series was produced by the cru at the university of east anglia possessing a 0 5 monthly resolution harris et al 2020 this is a gauge interpolated dataset widely used in arid regions guo et al 2018 meng et al 2022 and includes long term precipitation average temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature data since 1901 in order to reduce the considerable uncertainty that might have arisen from a single data source the mean value of these two above products were used in this study plus data on the components of silt sand and clay from the harmonized world soil database version 1 2 hwsd v1 2 with a 1 km spatial resolution were utilized to assess the influence of soil texture on sm other auxiliary data included the vegetation type map and the topographic data specifically the land use cover change lucc data were obtained from the vegetation atlas of the mongolian plateau which had a scale of 1 1000000 bao et al 2014 the digital elevation model dem with a grid size of 90 m 90 m was downloaded from the following website https earthexplorer usgs gov to explore the possible effects of extreme climate on sm two extreme precipitation indices and nine extreme temperature indices were calculated based on the cpc product table s1 to match the spatial resolution of era5 sm all variables from different sources were resampled or interpolated to 0 1 3 2 methodologies 3 2 1 geographic detector model gdm the gdm composed of factor detector ecological detector risk detector and interaction detector is a statistical method used to reveal the driving forces of the spatial heterogeneity of geographical variables wang and xu 2017 it can determine whether the independent variable has an influence on the dependent variable and the magnitude of the impact by detecting whether the spatial distribution of the dependent variable and the independent variable is consistent hu et al 2021b in this research on the mongolian plateau factor and interaction detectors were employed to detect the spatial heterogeneity of sm and the explanatory power of its influencing factors including climate precipitation and temperature vegetation ndvi and lucc topography dem slope and aspect and soil texture the contents of silt sand and clay the factor detector explored the spatial heterogeneity of the dependent variable y and the extent to which the independent variable x explained the spatial heterogeneity of y the explanatory power was determined by the q statistic stated as follows 1 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 1 ssw sst 2 ssw h 1 l n h σ h 2 s s t n σ 2 where h 1 2 l was the stratification of x and y generating 10 stratifications based on a natural breakpoint method table s2 the spatial classifications of the driving factors on the spatial heterogeneity of sm can be found in figure s3 n h and n were the numbers of cells in the stratification h and in the whole region respectively while σ h 2 and σ 2 were the respective variances of the y values in stratification h and in the whole region ssw and sst are the sum of the variance within the layer and the total variance of the region respectively the value range of q was 0 1 the larger the q value the stronger the explanatory power of the independent variable x to the spatial heterogeneity of y the interaction detector identified the interaction between different independent variables in other words it evaluated whether the two factors x1 and x2 enhanced or weakened the explanatory power of the dependent variable y when they worked in conjunction or if the impacts of these two factors on y were independent of each other wu and zhang 2021 according to the q statistic of interaction the interaction results were divided into five categories nonlinear weakening single factor nonlinear weakening bi factor enhancement independent relationship and nonlinear enhancement table s3 3 2 2 break for additive seasonal and trend the break for additive seasonal and trend bfast algorithm is a time series decomposition model which can effectively detect seasonal and trend breakpoints occurring in a time series fang et al 2018 it iteratively decomposes a given time series into a trend term a seasonal term and a residual term 3 y t t t s t t t 1 2 n where y t is the observational data at time step t t t and s t are the long term trend and seasonal terms respectively and t is the residual term by assuming that m breakpoints are detected by the trend term t t denoted as τ 1 τ 2 τ m the trend component t i is piecewise fitted with a linear model geng et al 2019 4 t i α i β i t τ i 1 t τ i i 1 m where α i and β i denote the intercept and slope of the linear model respectively and i is the location of the breakpoint τ 0 0 τ m 1 n in turn the seasonal term s t is segmentally fitted using a periodic model assuming that t 1 t 2 t p is the seasonal mutation point and t 0 0 the seasonal item is expressed as follows 5 s t k 1 k γ k sin 2 π k t f δ k where k is the location of the seasonal mutation point ranging from 1 to p moreover γ k and δ k represent the amplitude and phase respectively while f is the frequency in this study the variations in annual sm were analyzed as the seasonal cycle of the sm was not considered f 1 was adopted 3 2 3 nonlinear granger causality approach proposed by granger in 1969 the granger causality approach based on the predictability theory is used to identify causal relationships between changes in various variables papagiannopoulou et al 2016 as per the basic principle of this method when a time series x t is included as an independent variable to predict y t a significant improvement in the predictability of y t indicates a causal relationship between x t to y t wang et al 2019 to explain the nonlinear relationship between sm s variations and its driving factors the nonlinear granger causality approach can be considered in this study this method replaces the traditional linear vector autoregressive var model used in the granger causality approach with a commonly used nonlinear machine learning model thus enabling the granger causality approach to simulate nonlinear relationships between various environmental variables and sm changes papagiannopoulou et al 2017 therefore in this study a nonlinear granger causality approach based on the random forest model was used to explore the impact mechanisms of climate and vegetation changes on sm in the mongolian plateau hence the time series of sm climate and vegetation with seasonal cycles and long term trends had to be eliminated from the original time series before their application to the nonlinear granger causality approach wang et al 2019 as the granger approach was developed only for stationary time series taking the time series y t as an example a simple linear regression model was adopted initially to eliminate the linear trend of the time series y t the regression equation was expressed as follows 6 y t t a 0 a 1 t 7 y t d y t y t t where a 0 and a 1 denoted the slope and intercept of the regression equation respectively which were calculated by the least squares method y t t represented the predicted series based on the regression equation and y t d represented the series after the removal of the linear variation trend the seasonal cycle y t s obtained by calculating the multi year average of y t d for each month was subtracted from y t d to achieve the final stable time series y t r to this end the following formula was used 8 y t r y t d y t s further the stable time series y t r was used for this study s nonlinear granger causality test the coefficient of determination r2 was introduced to evaluate the forecasting model the r2 was calculated as follows 9 r 2 y y 1 rss tss 1 i p 1 n y i y i 2 i p 1 n y i y 2 where y represent the era5 sm series y is the predicted sm series and y is the mean value of y n and p are the lengths of time series and lag time moving window respectively generally the causality approach is usually performed using two variables however ignoring other primary influencing variables may lead to inaccurate results papagiannopoulou et al 2016 therefore in this study additional variables were also considered in building the forecast model which was used to decide whether x was the granger causal of y more specifically the sm time series was regarded as the response variable y t whereas precipitation temperature and ndvi were used as the predictor variables defined in this study as x t z t and w t respectively the established forecast model composed of four parts and predicting y t at time t i xt p xt p 1 xt ii yt p yt p 1 yt 1 iii zt p zt p 1 zt and iv wt p wt p 1 wt was defined as the full model all drivers are considered for example to explore whether precipitation was the granger causal of sm the predictor x t had to be removed from the established full model which was in turn defined as the precipitation excluded model the full model and precipitation excluded model were defined as follows 10 y t r f y t 1 r y t p r x t r x t p r z t r z t p r w t r w t p r ε 11 y t r 0 f 0 y t 1 r y t p r z t r z t p r w t r w t p r ε where ε is the error term f represents the full model to predict y t r using the information of all driving factors while f 0 represents the precipitation excluded model to predict y t r using the information without precipitation the difference in r2 between the full model and the precipitation excluded model was appraised as the contribution of precipitation to sm changes considering the lagged effects of the explanatory factors time series with 1 6 months lags p 6 of the predictors were added while establishing this study s prediction model moreover the extreme indices of climate as shown in table s1 and their lagged variables were also considered combining all the records described above 111 predictor variables were considered in this study s full model furthermore the random forest model which solely used the past values of sm for predicting sm was defined as the basic model therefore the improved r2 of the full model relative to the basic model was considered as providing the cumulative granger causals of precipitation temperature and ndvi with respect to sm changes in addition the number of predictor variables per node mtry and the number of regression trees ntree of the random forest model were set as one fifth of the total number of variables and 100 respectively five folds cross validation was further adopted to assess the performance of the full model papagiannopoulou et al 2016 4 results 4 1 the explanatory power of different factors regarding the spatial heterogeneity of sm strong spatial heterogeneity was found in the distribution of sm throughout the mongolian plateau which ranged from 0 07 to 0 43 m 3 m 3 in its vegetated area figure s4 generally sm at different layers of the plateau had a similar spatial distribution gradually decreasing from its northeastern to its southwestern parts the explanatory powers of different factors regarding the spatial heterogeneity of sm in the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 were determined based on the gdm fig 2 in addition to the surface 0 7 cm sm precipitation was found to possess the strongest explanatory power regarding the spatial heterogeneity of sm followed by ndvi and lucc concerning the heterogeneity of sm at surface layer ndvi possessed the strongest explanatory power followed by precipitation and lucc plus the q statistics of all these three factors were higher than 0 67 indicating that precipitation and vegetation conditions played a dominant role in the spatial heterogeneity of the plateau s sm the spatial distributions of precipitation and ndvi were also quite similar to that of sm in the plateau figure s5 consistent with the aforementioned findings moreover the explanatory powers of these three driving factors were found to possibly become less profound with the increase in soil depth meanwhile temperature was ranked fourth in terms of its explanatory power with the respective q ranging from 0 44 to 0 55 at different sm layers this finding unequivocally showed that water precipitation conditions had a broader and more significant influence on the heterogeneity of the plateau s sm compared with thermal temperature conditions the remaining topographic and soil texture factors were less significant for sm heterogeneity than climate and vegetation conditions with the concomitant values of q being less than 0 3 among the topographic elements the explanatory power of slope was significantly higher than those of elevation and aspect a larger slope was more favorable for sm infiltration and transfer from shallow to deep layers while the q of the slope also surged with the increase in soil depth however the soil textures including the contents of silt sand and clay often related to a soil s water holding capacity were not found to be a crucial factor of the spatial heterogeneity of sm in the mongolian plateau it had relatively less explanatory power with the related q values being less than 0 18 among different kinds of soil textures silt possessed the highest explanatory power at different layers of the plateau s soil followed by sand and clay further the interactions between different factors strengthened the explanatory power of the spatial heterogeneity of sm based on the results of interaction detection all interactions between these factors depicted functions of bi factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement fig 3 although aspect demonstrated extremely limited explanatory power it consistently presented a nonlinear enhancement of the effects on spatial heterogeneity of the plateau s sm while interacting with other factors the combined effects of different topographic variables and soil texture factors also presented such a nonlinear enhancement additionally temperature demonstrated a nonlinear enhancement in the heterogeneity of the plateau s sm while interacting with certain topographic and soil texture factors meanwhile interactions of other factors were expressed as bi factor enhancements more specially the interaction between precipitation and temperature demonstrated the highest explanatory power 0 86 0 89 followed by the interactions between precipitation and dem ndvi and temperature and precipitation and lucc the explanatory powers of these interactions between different variables exceeded 0 81 at different sm layers 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of sm dynamics in the mongolian plateau in line with the warmer and drier trend in the climate of the mongolian plateau its sm at all four layers presented a significant downward trend p less than 0 05 between 1982 and 2020 based on the results of sen s slope and mann kendall test text s2 the decreasing rates of sm were found to be 0 00101 0 00105 0 00124 and 0 00106 m 3 m 3 year 1 at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm respectively fig 4 locations demonstrating a decreasing trend of sm at all four layers from shallow to deep accounted for 95 84 94 23 91 46 and 92 41 of the total plateau s vegetated area respectively and the decreasing trend in most of these locations passed the 95 significance test fig 5 moreover the breakpoint detected results suggested that sm at all four layers experienced two changes in trend based on the bfast method figure s6 the first breakpoints of sm from shallow to deep layers occurred in 1994 1992 1993 and 1995 whereas the second breakpoint of sm occurred in 2007 at all four layers hence the study period was divided into three periods owing to two breakpoints these two breakpoints divided the sm change process at top three layers 0 100 cm into three stages increase decrease and then increase again meanwhile the sm at 100 289 cm presented a pattern of significant increase 1982 1995 followed by a significant decrease 1996 2007 and thereafter an insignificant increase 2008 2020 moreover the interannual fluctuation of the plateau s sm at 100 289 cm was significantly less than that of the sm at the three relatively upper layers presumably due to surface water and heat exchange processes having a lower influence on the plateau s sm at the deeper layers from the perspective of spatial distribution mainly an increasing trend in sm was observed before the first breakpoint throughout the mongolian plateau apart from its northeastern and central parts fig 5 the proportion of regions exhibiting this increasing trend was about 58 17 73 46 of the plateau area following the first breakpoint until 2007 soil desiccation was prevalent in 86 98 69 of the plateau s vegetated area especially in its northeastern and northwestern regions where soil desiccation was significant areas with increased sm were few and mainly distributed in the mountainous regions of northwestern and central mongolia this finding reflected that soil drying at this sub stage was the main reason behind the decline in the plateau s sm between 1982 and 2020 after 2007 soil desiccation at a depth of 0 100 cm decelerated and the soil regained moisture the moisture recovered area accounted for 63 82 80 39 of the plateau s vegetated area however sm at 100 289 cm in 61 26 of the plateau except for its northeastern northwestern and southwestern regions still exhibited a decreasing trend while the decline speed obviously decreased in the entire study period sm exhibited an increasing trend in only a small part of the southwestern mongolian plateau 4 16 8 54 while other areas particularly the northwest and southeast regions of the mongolian plateau experienced a significant decrease in sm 4 3 distinguishing and quantifying the driving factors of sm variability as shown in fig 6 the full nonlinear granger model of this study explained up to 97 of the sm changes in the mongolian plateau r 2 0 97 the r 2 of the full model progressed from the shallow to deep layers of the plateau s soil due to the largely increased r 2 of the basic model except for most deserts and typical steppes at 100 289 cm the previous conditions of sm at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm were able to explain 17 98 34 12 62 44 and 44 60 of sm variability on average based on the basic model this result indicated that the contributions of the forecasting model substantially increased when considering the antecedent conditions of sm itself to test the nonlinear granger causals of changes in climate and vegetation on the plateau s sm the concomitant differences between the full model and basic model were calculated the results unequivocally indicated a decrease in the contributions of climate and vegetation changes on sm upon an increase in soil depth in particular for sm at 100 289 cm the regions where sm variations had been granger caused by changes in climate and vegetation were found to be quite limited mainly located in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the plateau indeed the contribution of the sm cycle itself to sm change at a deep layer was always so high that the difference between the full model and the basic model was deemed minimal the average contributions of climate and vegetation were found to be 34 59 21 43 7 73 and 6 85 for sm changes at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm respectively to detect the nonlinear granger causal relationships between changes in sm and its different driving factors in the mongolian plateau the net effects of precipitation temperature and ndvi on sm changes were distinguished a nonlinear granger causal of these three variables precipitation temperature and vegetation with respect to sm at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm and 28 100 cm was observed over 99 97 99 42 and 92 26 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively fig 7 in addition for most of the regions where the nonlinear granger causals of sm were discovered sm at the three upper layers appeared to be primarily controlled by precipitation with the largest proportion of temperature and vegetation dominant areas amounting to only 5 43 of the entire plateau regarding the sm anomalies at 100 289 cm the three abovementioned driving factors variables demonstrated an influence on about 54 02 of the plateau s vegetated area additionally at 100 289 cm no granger causality r 2 0 between precipitation and sm changes was observed over about 45 98 of the plateau s vegetated area mainly covered by typical steppe and desert steppe moreover temperature and vegetation were deemed the most important driving factors contributing to sm changes at 100 289 cm in 8 60 and 12 04 of plateau s vegetated area respectively the aforementioned results implied that with increasing soil depth the area primarily controlled by precipitation decreased accompanied by an increase in the area primarily controlled by temperature and vegetation more specially precipitation was found to be the primary controlling factor regarding sm changes in 33 39 97 65 of the plateau s vegetated area while temperature and vegetation were the most important limiting factors for 2 32 20 64 of its vegetated area additionally up to 40 of the plateau s sm changes could be explained by precipitation especially the sm at top two 0 28 cm soil layers in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the plateau fig 8 the effects of precipitation weakened distinctly with the increase in soil depth with the concomitantly affected regions accounting for 99 92 99 03 88 35 and 43 05 of the plateau s vegetated area areas with remarkable precipitation related effects on sm below 28 cm were mainly located in the high altitude regions in the northern part of the mongolian plateau meanwhile temperature explained 0 14 of sm changes in the mongolian plateau which was remarkable considering the two upper soil layers in northeastern inner mongolia the regions where temperature played a most dominant role in sm at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm accounted for 2 30 1 63 5 43 and 8 6 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively also the plateau areas affected by temperature evidently decreased in proportion with an increase in soil depth apart from sm at the surface layer 54 90 the regions where temperature was deemed the nonlinear granger causal of sm were found to be less than 30 14 61 27 25 of the plateau s vegetated area further sm was found to be granger caused by ndvi in only 27 75 36 61 of the plateau s vegetated areas with an average ndvi contribution of less than 3 the areas where ndvi became the most important limiting factor for sm at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm accounted for 0 02 0 34 3 60 and 12 04 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively as the intensity and scope of the sm change nonlinear granger caused by ndvi were minute they could serve as regulators for sm changes 4 4 quantifying the time lagged effects of climate change on sm regarding the sm s memory of climate change the latency in sm response to climate and vegetation needed to be explored as well as the contributions of ndvi to sm variability was quite limited in the plateau the lagged effects of ndvi were not discussed further generally the concurrent precipitation lag 0 demonstrated the strongest contribution for surface sm changes particularly prominent in areas with extreme sm scarcity such as the southwestern part of the mongolian plateau fig 9 on another note 17 3 of sm changes at the surface layer of the plateau s soil could be explained by contemporaneous precipitation in 99 84 of its vegetated areas the lagged effects of changes in precipitation on surface sm were thoroughly limited on a monthly scale with the average contributions of antecedent precipitation being less than 1 17 in about 53 87 67 98 of the study area these results indicated that the effects of precipitation on the plateau s surface sm were immediate and dissipated rapidly although less than the influences of contemporaneous precipitation one month antecedent precipitation still explained 0 14 65 of the subsurface 7 28 cm sm changes in 93 14 of the study area interestingly the amount of precipitation in the previous month lag 1 contributed more to sm at 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm than that in the concurrent month indicating sm s higher resistance to water conditions in the soil s deep layers this phenomenon was not reported previously and emphasized the importance of considering the lag effect of climate change in this study the sm changes at 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm were influenced by one month antecedent precipitation in about 87 33 and 43 02 of the plateau s total area respectively demonstrating this precipitation s concomitant average contributions of 3 2 and 1 98 respectively the influences of precipitation to sm at deeper layers lasted even longer than three months in a few regions though this phenomenon was accompanied by a gradual weakening of the lagged effects fig 10 shows the lagged effects of temperature on sm in the mongolian plateau to elaborate concurrent temperature affected surface and subsurface sm changes in 92 51 and 77 70 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively with the accompanying average contributions being 3 62 and 2 29 respectively surface and subsurface sm changes were nonlinear granger caused by antecedent temperature in about 36 80 57 23 of the plateau s vegetated area with its average contributions being less than 1 0 73 0 93 this indicated the short term memory of sm regarding temperature at the shallow layers plus no apparent changes were observed in the effects of temperature on sm at 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm for various monthly time lags generally zero month one month two month and three month antecedent temperature contributed to sm at 28 100 cm in 51 13 57 54 44 61 and 44 19 of the study area respectively while their average contributions were found to be 1 36 1 22 1 09 and 1 05 respectively the intensity and the scope of temperature determined sm changes at 100 289 cm reduced gradually relative to sm at 28 100 cm also notable was the fact that the effects of temperature on sm at deeper soil layers were relatively weak but durable compared to its effects on sm at shallower layers 4 5 quantifying the effects of climate extremes on sm to explore the effects of climate extremes on sm changes in the mongolian plateau the individual effects of extreme precipitation and temperature were also quantified fig 11 unlike the effects of general precipitation no apparent differences were observed in the effects of the two extreme precipitation indices selected in this study especially on sm at the top three layers the average contributions of extreme precipitation were 1 08 1 24 1 28 and 1 81 on sm from the surface to the deeper layers while the concomitantly affected areas accounted for 56 75 58 07 50 29 and 33 88 of the vegetated area in the plateau respectively plus on a spatial average nine extreme temperature indices respectively explained 2 43 2 53 2 11 and 3 55 of sm changes at 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm of depth whereas the main limited areas r2 10 varied for different layers the areas in which extreme temperatures grange caused sm changes accounted for 39 05 25 41 25 87 and 16 84 of the plateau s vegetated area respectively and were distributed mainly around northeastern inner mongolia for sm at 0 28 cm and sporadically around northwestern mongolia and northeastern inner mongolia for sm at 28 289 cm 5 discussion 5 1 influencing factors on spatial heterogeneity of sm in the mongolian plateau the analysis of sm distribution in the mongolian plateau suggested the existence of a strong spatial heterogeneity the main influencing factors i e precipitation ndvi and lucc explained the spatial heterogeneity of sm lesser with an increase in soil depth this finding could be attributed to the spatial distribution of sm at deep layers being more stable while the sm at shallow layers remained more susceptible to random changes in external conditions zhao et al 2017 as the most important source of sm precipitation was unsurprisingly found to possess the highest explanatory power for the spatial heterogeneity of sm at 7 289 cm however ndvi was observed to be the most significant driving factor of sm heterogeneity at the surface layer while the explanatory power of precipitation regarding surface sm was ranked second still higher than its explanatory power regarding sm at 7 289 cm the possible reason for this finding could be the following the annual amount of light precipitation less than5 mm in the mongolian plateau accounted for a larger proportion of total precipitation than the annual amounts of moderate and heavy precipitation which were even higher than 80 in some of the plateau s regions yuan et al 2015 light precipitation preferentially replenished sm at the shallow layer which was more rapidly absorbed and easily utilized by herbaceous plants cheng et al 2006 the ndvi of grasslands also appeared to have a higher correlation with light precipitation yuan et al 2015 also the fact that different vegetation types sm demands and water absorption by roots vary deng et al 2016 could be another important reason why vegetation types were found to have a considerable impact on the spatial heterogeneity of sm meng et al 2022 wang et al 2019 meanwhile the contributions of temperature to sm heterogeneity were above 40 q 0 4 by affecting the evapotranspiration process temperature determined the amount of water loss of the plateau s soil stefanon et al 2014 in agreement with the previous findings of meng et al 2022 topography and soil properties contributed less to sm heterogeneity in the mongolian plateau than climate and vegetation while complex interactions between these variables were suggested the interactions between topography and soil textures preferred a nonlinear enhancement indicating that soil properties topographical parameters were able to significantly influence sm under certain terrain soil property conditions aspect in particular exhibited nonlinear enhancement while interacting with other factors indeed lee and kim 2017 also indicated that the relationship between sm variability and precipitation fluctuated with regard to different aspects therefore future studies should consider the links between the different drivers of spatial heterogeneity in sm 5 2 main driving factors on sm dynamics in the mongolian plateau over the past 39 years the mongolian plateau s sm significantly decreased consistent with the warmer and drier trend in its climate tao et al 2015 two breakpoints were present in the trends of the plateau s annual sm around 1992 and 2007 importantly the plateau s soil desiccation over the past 39 years was primarily caused by the significant decreases in its sm from 1993 to 2007 as confirmed by fig 4 consistent with this study s findings meng et al 2022 analyzed the effects of different environmental factors on sm variability in the mongolian plateau discovering that precipitation remained the main control for its sm changes between 1982 and 2019 with same pattern of first increasing then decreasing and then increasing again lu et al 2021 found that the mongolian plateau experienced a severely dry period from 2000 to 2018 and its vegetation productivity was the lowest in 2007 in line with the resulting breakpoint in sm in 2007 that was found by the current study a severe drought in 2007 was also discovered by wei et al 2022 taking into account the shifts in and the dynamics of sm that may have been introduced by the above driving factors the associated changes in climate and vegetation were further explored in this study according to the time of the breakpoints the study period was divided into three smaller periods phase i 1982 1992 phase ii 1993 2007 and phase iii 2008 2020 as per figure s7 precipitation displayed the same change trend as that of sm at 0 100 cm in each period while the temperature always exhibited an upward trend figure s7 interestingly vegetation had the same trend as that of sm at 0 100 cm throughout the three sub stages but its trend was opposite to that of sm when considering the whole period hence this study claims that the breakpoints regarding sm in the mongolian plateau were expected to be mainly associated with the dynamics of precipitation from the perspective of space the spatial distribution of precipitation dynamics was also quite similar to that of sm figure s8 further confirming the abovementioned view although increased precipitation did not lead to increases in sm at 100 289 cm after 2007 it obviously slowed down the decreasing rate of sm fig 4 except the decreased precipitation the consistently increased temperature was another prominent reason behind the reduction in the plateau s sm owing to increasing evapotranspiration figure s9 displays the obvious negative relationship between temperature and sm throughout most of the plateau however the low sm of its arid and semi arid regions constrained evapotranspiration conversely wang et al 2019 thus resulting in relatively lower effects of temperature on the plateau s sm the statistical results also revealed uneven spatiotemporal changes in vegetation greenness at 0 001 a as reported by jasechko et al 2013 vegetation expansion would accelerate sm drying in an arid region with the possible reason being the influence of vegetation on evapotranspiration this could explain a part of the sm drying in the plateau the quantitation of the granger causes of climate and vegetation with regard to sm changes based on an improved nonlinear granger causality approach depicted that sm changes at the top layer in the mongolian plateau were primarily controlled by precipitation temperature and vegetation in 97 65 2 30 and 0 03 of its vegetated area respectively these results could be compared with the findings of wang et al 2019 who reported the most dominant role of precipitation 87 in xinjiang china another typical arid and semi arid region close to our study region moreover gazis and feng 2004 pointed out that the contributions of precipitation gradually decreased with the increase in a given soil depth also in agreement with the findings of our study as discussed earlier only heavy precipitation events were able to replenish the plateau s sm at deeper layers cheng et al 2006 as most of the light precipitation was intercepted and could not infiltrate into the deeper layers of soil tashie et al 2016 song et al 2019 found the correlations between precipitation and sm to be closer at shallow soil layers compared to deeper layers in the desert steppe of inner mongolia additionally extremely heavy precipitation was considered as playing a significant role in determining the amount of sm at deep soil layers with the results displayed in fig 11 further proving that extreme precipitation presented effects on sm at deep layers that were comparable with its effects on sm at shallow layers however the importance of extreme precipitation was lower compared to general precipitation due to the former s infrequency in the plateau papagiannopoulou et al 2017 nevertheless snow cover could be considered as an important water source in the mongolian plateau sa et al 2021 indeed potopová et al 2016 found that snow water equivalent explained up to 45 of soil moisture variability during the early summer season also shallow groundwater was reported as an important source of sm recharge at a deeper layer in arid regions rao et al 2020 and spatiotemporal variations in the groundwater level directly affected the distribution characteristics of sm at such a deeper layer chen et al 2007 in future studies the dependence of sm on snow cover as well as groundwater will be included to better reveal the causes of changes in sm at deep layer similarly a decreasing negative relationship was identified between temperature and sm with regard to increase in soil depth in most of the study area this could be attributed to the high temperatures leading to direct moisture evaporation from the surface of the soil cho and choi 2014 the insights from fig 8 revealed that the contribution of vegetation to variabilities in sm was limited less than 3 in 27 75 36 61 of the plateau s vegetated area this discovery agreed with the findings of feng 2016 who emphasized a relatively weak and negative influence of vegetation change on sm because of the limited areas over which vegetation occurs in terms of lag effects with the exception of sm at the two upper layers 0 28 cm one month antecedent precipitation had highest contributions to sm changes previous studies revealed that the effect of precipitation on sm at deep layers displayed a time lag ranging from one to three months hu et al 2021a varikoden and revadekar 2017 since precipitation took time to permeate into the soil and convert to sm at deep layers moreover the differences of convert times were relevant to the degree of development of the plateau s vegetation root system the infiltration capacity of its soil the initial water content of its soil etc gao et al 2014 jin et al 2018 mcnamara et al 2005 zhu et al 2021 these findings suggested that the incorporation of the lag effects into a dynamic sm modelling could improve the accuracy of sm quantification effectively in support wu et al 2015 also emphasized that considering only contemporaneous effects would largely underestimate the effects of climate change moreover the effects of temperature on sm were found to be more immediate maximum effect at lag 0 compared to those of precipitation in line with the results of wang et al 2019 the immediate response of sm to temperature could be attributed to the adaptive strategies of sm the regulation of evapotranspiration 5 3 implications and uncertainties of the study this study sheds light on the effects of climate and vegetation conditions on sm variability based on an improved nonlinear granger causality approach going a step beyond the commonly used statistical analysis e g correlation analysis of the drivers of sm variability all simultaneous delayed and extreme events effects of climate change on sm variability are quantified and distinguished simultaneously providing a more systematic understanding of the drivers of sm changes however we should declare that since the contribution of a particular driver to sm changes is calculated by subtracting it from the full model of this study its causal effect on sm may be underestimated if the remaining drivers are highly correlated to the one that is subtracted correspondingly the contribution r2 is explained as a unique causal relationship of the particular driver that is subtracted that cannot be explained by remaining drivers in the full model in addition a few uncertainties in this study must be addressed by future research first the granger causal relationships between the various driving factors and sm variability in the mongolian plateau should be significantly different owing to the presence of permafrost and snow cover at its high altitudes the characteristics of this aspect are not yet clear second due to the unfeasibility of including all the possible driving factors of sm anomalies the contributions computed by r 2 are not sufficiently accurate third given that the hydrothermal condition in the mongolian plateau has a strong heterogeneity an evaluation must be conducted to determine whether this heterogeneity is directly related to the contributions of driving factors to sm changes finally it is important to note that the resulting contributions of these drivers are influenced by the length of the study period the parameters of the model the spatial resolution and accuracy of the data etc which may lead to the differences with the findings of other studies therefore reducing these uncertainties in the results is a challenge for future work on this topic 6 conclusions in this study we identify the contributions of different environmental factors to the heterogeneity and variability of sm at different layers in the mongolian plateau between 1982 and 2020 the results can be summarized as follows 1 the spatial distribution of sm at various layers in the mongolian plateau is characterized by high sm in its northeastern part and low sm in its southwestern region which can be mainly attributed to differences in precipitation ndvi and lucc complex interactions are observed between different driving factors mainly manifesting as bi factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement 2 two breakpoints in early 1990 s and 2007 have resulted in the plateau s sm change process displaying a characteristic of increase decrease and then increase again slower decrease at 0 100 cm 100 289 cm mainly attributable to the significant downward trend of the plateau s sm since the early 1990 s to 2007 its sm at all four layers has displayed a widespread drying trend in 91 46 95 84 of its vegetated area between 1982 and 2020 3 precipitation is the primary driving factor influencing 33 39 97 65 of the plateau s vegetated area and explains up to 40 of sm changes in about 43 05 99 92 of its vegetated area temperature explains 2 73 5 23 of sm changes in 14 61 54 90 of its vegetated area while vegetation explains less than 3 of sm changes in 27 75 36 61 of its vegetated area the contributions of climate and vegetation on sm decrease with increases in soil depth 4 sm has a longer memory of precipitation compared with temperature the precipitation of the previous month lag 1 demonstrate greater contributions to the plateau s sm changes at 28 289 cm than that of the concurrent month while the contributions of temperature decrease gradually with regard to the increases in lag times the contributions of climatic extremes to sm changes are less than those of the regular climate conditions in summary our study reveals the unidirectional dependency of sm on environmental factors in the mongolian plateau thereby improving our understanding of the key factors driving the spatial heterogeneity of and changes in its regional sm some of our calculation procedures and results can also be applied in other studies in addition the primary drivers of sm changes may shift according to different seasons due to the intra annual variability of the mongolian plateau s climate as well as the plateau s plant phenological cycles which can be further compared yet future studies on the bidirectional dependency between the plateau s sm and the related environmental factors must attempt to reveal the underlying mechanisms of its sm responses and feedbacks with regard to changes in

1916,the carbon and water cycle patterns of frozen soil ecosystems in regions such as the qinghai tibet plateau qtp which have fragile and sensitive ecologies are possibly affected by climate change however these patterns along the gradients of varying degrees of freezing remain poorly understood in this study we examine the spatio temporal patterns of water use efficiency wue gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et in six frozen soil zones of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp with varying degrees of frozen soil the analysis is based on the frozen soil classification criteria and remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020 the influences of six climatic nine edaphic and two botanic parameters on these patterns is also investigated the results indicate that 48 05 24 07 and 20 of the regions in qtp exhibit significantly upward trends of gpp et and wue respectively the highest increase trends were observed in gpp in the middle thick seasonally frozen ground zone 2 36 g c m 2 yr 1 et in the mountain permafrost zone 2 35 mm yr 1 and wue in the predominantly continuous permafrost zone 0 003 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 meanwhile gpp and wue decrease progressively with the increase of freezing degrees from the short time frozen ground zone gpp 604 99 51 99 g c m 2 wue 2 34 0 15 g c kg 1 h2o to the predominantly continuous permafrost zone gpp 114 07 11 77 g c m 2 wue 0 33 0 04 g c kg 1 h2o while et does not show significant differences across the three permafrost zones the enhanced vegetation index is the primary factor affecting gpp and wue in most frozen soil zones whereas climate variables mainly impact et our findings emphasize the importance of considering the effects of different freezing degrees of frozen soil when analyzing the response of the carbon and water cycles in the qtp in the context of climate change keywords qinghai tibet plateau water use efficiency frozen soil climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial ecosystems play a crucial role in energy exchange at the earth s critical zone through their carbon and water cycles climate changes significantly impact the carbon and water cycles and alter the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems for instance shifts in vegetation function types and water availability affect ecosystem productivity water use efficiency wue i e the ratio of vegetation productivity to water loss is a critical measure of the carbon and water cycles in ecosystems and an important feature of an ecosystem s functioning it is determined by the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp i e the gross amount of organic carbon fixed by vegetation through photosynthesis per unit of time to evapotranspiration et i e the sum of vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and leaf interception evaporation yu et al 2008 understanding how wue is changing and what drives these changes therefore remains a critical component for understanding the responses of ecosystems under the climate change beer et al 2009 zhu et al 2015 knauer et al 2017 it can also support optimizing regional water resources and developing measures to address the impacts of climate changes qinghai tibetan plateau qtp often referred to as the roof of the world is known to amplify the effects of global climate change wang et al 2022 the low temperature and high altitude of the qtp lead to the widespread distribution of frozen soil wang et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 with areas of permafrost covering about 53 of the region feng et al 2019 the frozen soils have a significant impact on the ecosystems of the qtp which are highly sensitive to climate changes particularly rising temperatures cheng and jin 2013 zhang et al 2016 changes in frozen soils can drastically alter hydrothermal fluxes in the soil and the processes of carbon and water cycles in ecosystems woo et al 2008 however in the qtp there has been a lack of research analyzing the patterns of gpp et and wue across the different frozen soil zones and the factors driving them therefore it is essential to fill the gap in understanding the state of the carbon and water cycles in the frozen qtp soil region climate warming has been shown to have a cumulative effect on terrestrial ecosystem processes in the frozen soil areas davidson and janssens 2006 the degradation of frozen soil alters its physical structure leading to changes in their nutrient and hydrological status which are critical determinants of vegetation functional type and productivity christensen et al 2003 grosse et al 2016 for example jorgenson et al 2001 found that extensive permafrost degradation in central alaska led to a rapid ecosystem shift from forest to bog inevitably altering its regional carbon fluxes yuan et al 2020 found that ecosystems carbon fluxes increase more than water fluxes in the boreal permafrost region of asia during the 1900 2100 primarily due to increasing vegetation activity in the boreal permafrost region notably chen et al 2022 recently used tree annual ring width and stable isotope methods to show that while the permafrost degradation zone enhanced the intrinsic wue of trees tree developmental growth was not significantly promoted however it remains unclear how water and carbon change with different degrees of freezing in the qtp areas in recent years several studies have explored the patterns of the carbon water coupling over the qtp lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 for instance wang et al 2020 discovered that the wue over the qtp increased at a rate of 0 004 g c kg 1h2o yr 1 from 1982 to 2015 due to the combined effects of climate warming and increased precipitation lin et al 2020 used biogeophysical and chemical modeling to assess the wue over qtp showing that the rate of increase in wue was only 0 001 g c kg 1h2o yr 1 from 1979 to 2010 the study concluded that an increase in atmospheric co2 concentration influenced 51 of the change in wue in addition recent studies show that the average annual values of grass wue of qtp significantly increased during 2001 2017 where climate played a significant role liu et al 2021 nonetheless these studies have only focused on an influence of vegetation or climate and have not taken soil properties into account further comprehensive studies are needed to involve more parameters such as higher soil nitrogen n which promotes plant growth and affects the carbon and water cycles of an ecosystem the in situ eddy covariance ec technique is widely regarded as the most reliable approach for measuring ecosystems carbon water cycling directly and accurately at the landscape scale yu et al 2008 however tower based ec measurements suffer from spatial sampling limitations tang et al 2016 as they only provide local information on carbon water fluxes at certain points babaeian et al 2019 remote sensing technology with its capabilities for large scale and high frequency observations offers a useful alternative tool for monitoring regional and even global changes in ecosystems carbon and water cycles scholze et al 2017 most previous studies have used traditional linear regression methods to analyze the factors influencing the carbon and water cycles of ecosystems zhu et al 2015 cristiano et al 2020 however these cycles are driven by many non linear processes the emergence and widespread use of machine learning methods such as neural network models abbaszadeh shahri et al 2021 ghaderi et al 2022 random forest algorithms and support vector machines li et al 2021 provide an effective approach of exploring the non linear relationships between dependent and independent variables this study aims to analyze the patterns and differences of wue gpp and et from 2001 to 2020 in six frozen soil zones over the qtp that have varying degrees of soil freezing in the study we have analyzed remote sensing data and employed machine learning and partial regression methods to identify potential parameters affecting the carbon water coupling of different frozen soil ecosystems based on parameters involving climate soil and vegetation specifically this study will i analyze the spatio temporal patterns of gpp et and wue of regions with different frozen soil types over the qtp from 2001 to 2020 ii compare fluctuations and differences in gpp et and wue based on different frozen soil zones and iii introduce a more comprehensive set of parameters involving climate vegetation and soil factors to determine their impacts on gpp et and wue in the various frozen soil zones of the qtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 1 located at the intersection of the eurasian and indian plates is the highest plateau in the world with a total area of about 2 57 million km2 qiu 2008 and a dense regional water network fig s1 precipitation on the qtp occurs mainly from may to october and decreases in distribution from southeast to northwest due to topographic differences and monsoonal influences ren et al 2021 the plateau is characterized by large diurnal temperature differences and a trend of decreasing temperatures with increasing latitudes and altitudes zhou et al 2021 vertically and horizontally these differences in climate and topography result in a highly uneven distribution of thermal and water conditions over the qtp sun et al 2019 according to the soil taxonomy of usda united states department of agriculture the soil type of the qtp mainly consists of gelisol and inceptisol 2 2 data preparation 2 2 1 gross primary production and

cryosphere desert data center https www ncdc ac cn the frozen soil of the qinghai tibet plateau is classified into six types the thin seasonally frozen ground tsfg short time frozen ground stfg mountain permafrost mp middle thick seasonally frozen ground mtsfg predominantly continuous and island permafrost pcip and predominantly continuous permafrost pcp these classification is based on

frozen soil depth in tsfg does not exceed one meter while the value exceeds one meter for mtsfg permafrost e g pcp pcip and mp is usually soil or rocks that remain frozen for long periods and the average depth ranges from 10 m to around 200 m as for the spatial continuity they are classified into continuous permafrost e g pcp and discontinuous permafrost e g pcip and mp 2 2 3 environmental

unified to world geodetic system 84 wgs 84 the data were resampled to obtain data with a spatial resolution of 500 m using a bilinear interpolation method abbaszadeh shahri et al 2019 the resampled data of the 17 factors had 3619 rows and 6804 columns with 24 623 676 pixels the study investigated the series of variables on an annual scale with gpp et and map data being obtained from annual cumulative values and the other time series variables were synthesized as annual averages the data preprocessing was done using r language r core development team vienna austria to ensure that all data are generated in the required coordinate system and resolution 2 3 sample analyses 2 3 1 water use efficiency for ecosystems the water use efficiency wue at the ecosystem scale wueeco is defined as the ratio of gross primary production gpp to evapotranspiration et huang et al 2015 he et al 2017 cristiano et al 2020 kayiranga et al 2020 which reflects the ability of an ecosystem to convert carbon into biomass through water consumption beer et al 2009 knauer et al 2017 i e 1 wue eco gpp et 2 3 2 trend and difference analysis firstly trend analysis is conducted at two scales pixel and regional zheng et al 2019 at the pixel scale annual trends of gpp et and wue on the qtp from 2001 to 2020 were calculated using the theil sen median trend analysis jiang et al 2015 and mann kendall test zou et al 2020 theil sen median is a robust nonparametric statistical trend calculation method the method is computationally efficient and insensitive to measurement errors and outlier data rahman and muhammad 2017 the mann kendall test is a nonparametric test approach which does not require the measurement values to obey a gaussian distribution and is not affected by missing values and outliers fensholt et al 2012 these methods have been widely used to analyze trends of time series data fensholt et al 2012 rahman and muhammad 2017 at the regional scale trends of gpp et and wue were calculated using ordinary least squares zheng et al 2019 secondly stability analysis of time series data based on the coefficient of variation was conducted to evaluate data variation over the time series zhang et al 2022 i e 2 cv σ μ where σ is the standard deviation and μ is the arithmetic mean the larger the cv the more the data fluctuates over time and the more discrete the data distributed is finally a one way analysis of variance anova combined with multiple comparisons tukey hsd non parametric test was used to identify the differences in gpp et and wue among frozen soil types separately 2 3 3 analysis of driving parameters 1 relative importance analysis firstly in the qtp 10 000 random points were set with the number of random points selected according to the percentage of the area of different frozen soil types then the values of gpp et wue and all environmental variables were extracted from these points according to the coordinates in regions with different frozen soil types the data were filtered to remove points with missing values for the variables resulting in a final database of 6358 points the r package used was applied to test the collinearity diagnostics among the environmental variables variables with variance inflation factor vif higher than 10 were considered collinear and thus excluded from the analysis the boruta algorithm kursa and rudnicki 2010 was used with the boruta package in r language to determine the relative importance of variables affecting gpp et and wue for the whole of qinghai tibet plateau and different frozen soil types the boruta algorithm is a wrapper built around the random forest classification algorithm and captures all significant explanatory variables that affect the response variable li et al 2021 2 partial correlation analysis the environmental variables that pass the collinearity diagnostics were classified into three categories climate vegetation and soil principal component analysis awange et al 2018 was then conducted to obtain the first principal components of the climate vegetation and soil factors for the corresponding years partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing gpp et and wue on the spatial pattern of the qtp the advantage of this method is that it allows controlling the effects of other explanatory variables when analyzing partial correlations between the response variable and the explanatory variables liu et al 2020 the workflow of this study is summarized in fig 2 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal pattern and variations in gpp et and wue the mean annual gpp over the qinghai tibet plateau is 266 86 16 52 g c m 2 yr 1 and decreases from east to west fig 3 a the gpp decreases gradually from lower to higher latitudes and levels off by 29 n fig 4 a the average annual gpp over the qtp increases at a rate of 1 74 g c m 2 yr 1 for the 2001 2020 period r2 0 37 p 0 004 fig 5 a with a significant increasing trend of 48 05 in the vegetation areas located in the central eastern region fig 3d only a small portion 0 75 of the vegetation areas show a significant decrease in gpp primarily in the southwest fig 3d interannual fluctuation of gpp on the qtp is only visible in the central southern areas fig 3g the mean annual et from the qtp is 355 89 17 96 mm yr 1 fig 3b et values are generally lower at high latitudes compared to those at middle or low latitudes with a peak observed around 35 n and 28 n fig 4b interannual variation from 2001 to 2020 shows an increase in et at a trend of 1 50 mm yr 1 per year r2 0 23 p 0 032 fig 5b the significant p 0 05 increasing and decreasing trends in et occur in the northeastern and mid western part of qtp respectively accounting for 24 07 and 1 34 of the vegetation area fig 3e the stability of et is higher overall in the northern regions of the qtp than other areas fig 3h the annual mean wue over qtp is 0 81 0 04 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 fig 3c the spatial distribution and latitudinal pattern of mean annual wue are consistent with the pattern of gpp with the highest annual wue at the southeastern edge of qtp at low latitudes fig 3c 4c inter annual variations in wue increases at a rate of 0 0017 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 r2 0 05 but the trend is not significant fig 5c a significant increasing trend is observed in about 20 of the vegetated areas mainly in the central part of the plateau while only 4 47 of the area experiences a significant decrease p 0 05 fig 3f the increase of wue in the central part of qtp is mainly due to a decrease in et and an increase of gpp in these locations however the increase of wue in the northeast may be due to a faster increase of gpp than et conversely the decrease in et and the increase in gpp lead to an increase in wue along the southeastern fringe of the qtp the stability of qtp water use efficiency fluctuates widely in the southwest and northwest from 2001 to 2020 fig 3i table 2 provides details of the carbon and water cycles over the qinghai tibet plateau and different frozen soil zones from 2001 to 2020 3 2 gpp et and wue variations among zones of frozen soil the growth rate of gpp is 2 12 g c m 2 yr 1 in short time frozen ground and in thin seasonally frozen ground the value is 2 34 g c m 2 yr 1 although the trend is not significant the largest significant positive trend in gpp is observed in middle thick seasonally frozen ground 2 36 g c m 2 yr 1 followed by mountain permafrost 1 57 g c m 2 yr 1 predominantly continuous permafrost 1 35 g c m 2 yr 1 and predominantly continuous and island permafrost 1 25 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 5a the greatest significant positive trend in et is observed in zones with mp 2 35 mm yr 1 followed by mtsfg 2 21 mm yr 1 and pcip 1 36 mm yr 1 while the increasing trend in other permafrost zones is not significant fig 5b the only zone in the qtp that shows a significant increasing trend in wue is the pct type with an increasing rate of 0 003 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 fig 5c the interannual fluctuations in gpp et and wue show consistent regularity in all frozen soil zones fig 5 significant differences in average gpp et and wue are observed among the different frozen soil zones there are overall decreasing trends of gpp and wue as the degree of freezing increases fig 6 a c stfg and pcp have the lowest and highest freezing levels corresponding to the highest and lowest gpp stfg 604 99 51 99 g c m 2 pcp 114 07 11 77 g c m 2 and the highest and lowest wue stfg 2 34 0 15 g c kg 1 h2o pcp 0 33 0 04 g c kg 1 h2o respectively there is no clear trend in et along the degree of freezing fig 6b with the lowest et 293 59 20 55 mm for stfg and the highest 379 91 22 76 mm in mtsfg furthermore unlike other frozen soil types the higher gpp and lower et of stfg lead to a higher wue 3 3 effects of environmental factors on carbon water coupling the vif variance inflation factor for the environmental factors including mean annual temperature mat 4 17 mean annual precipitation

clay clay 1 55 soil silt silt 1 88 and enhanced vegetation index evi 2 62 are all 10 thus the collinearity diagnostics indicate that these environmental factors can be used for subsequent analyses the assessment of relative importance shows that evi msp and mat are all the top three most important variables explaining changes in gpp and wue on the qtp fig 7 a c in contrast mat is the most important independent variable affecting et while evi and mws are the second and third most important variables respectively fig 7b consistently the most important variable influencing the changes in gpp for all the six frozen soil types is evi fig 8 a f evi is also the most important variable for explaining wue for the five frozen soil types tsfg mtsfg mp pcip and pcp the most important variable in stfg wue is msp while evi still has a relatively high importance fig 8m r in the areas with mp and pcip evi is the most important variable in explaining et the most important variables influencing et in the stfg tsfg mtsfg and pcp frozen soil regions are map map mat and msp respectively fig 8g l partial correlation analysis suggests that vegetation factors control over 44 72 and 62 of the area over the qtp for the variations of gpp et and wue respectively followed by climate gpp 31 et 18 wue 27 and soil factors gpp 25 et 10 wue 11 fig 9 the areas with dominating vegetation factors are mainly distributed in the eastern and marginal regions for the gpp and the central and eastern parts for et while the vegetation dominating area is more dispersed for the wue for climatic factors the dominating areas are mainly concentrated in the western part for et and wue soil factors mainly have a dominating influence in the northern part for gpp et and wue in the different frozen soil regions vegetation remains the main factor influencing the carbon and water cycles except in 41 of the pcip region where meteorological factors dominate still 38 of the area is subject to vegetation factors the areas controlled by soil factors remain small for gpp et and wue table 3 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal patterns of carbon water coupling on the qinghai tibet plateau the annual average gpp over the qinghai tibet plateau shows a similar spatial distribution to wue fig 3a c while the annual mean et does not exhibit a similar trend fig 3b gpp and wue show gradual decreases with the increases of freezing degrees while et does not show this obvious pattern figs 5 6 the dominant role of gpp on wue is also supported by the similar patterns of gpp and wue along the gradient of latitude while et does not show this similar pattern fig 4 the dominant role of gpp is in accordance with the results of wang et al 2020 over the qtp region from 1982 to 2015 though the year of the study differs liu et al 2020 suggested that gpp dominated the variation of wue mainly in moist regions but this is also true for the semi arid and semi humid regions of the qtp temporally this study finds that the wue on the qinghai tibet plateau has a slight and insignificant increase from 2001 to 2020 with a growth rate of 0 002 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 p 0 05 this result is in accordance with a recent finding using carbon isotopes technology which showed that a global increasing trend of wue has slowed down adams et al 2020 although some studies suggested that the wue calculated from isotopes are overestimated marchand et al 2020 gong et al 2022 the conclusion that the rate of increase of wue is slowing is still reasonable because the modification changes the wue in the same direction for each year the insignificant increase in wue is related to the simultaneous increase of gpp and et the average annual gpp has increased significantly at 1 74 g c m 2 yr 1 from 2001 to 2020 over the qtp which is greater than the growth ratio 1 01 g c m 2 yr 1 from 1987 to 2013 ma et al 2017 however the growth ratio of et in the same period is also high 1 5 mm y 1 as confirmed by a previous study which showed a significant increase in et by 21 56 for the regions in qtp from 1982 to 2015 yang 2020 vegetation and climate factors are the main variables that drive the variability of carbon water coupling over the qtp figs 7 8 9 increased vegetation cover enhanced vegetation index evi reflects the growth of vegetation and gpp usually increases with the increasing of evi rahman et al 2005 this analysis is supported by a significant linear relation between evi and gpp r 0 88 p 0 05 fig s2 meanwhile evi also significantly promotes et r 0 40 p 0 05 as more water is required to fulfill the transportation of nutrition and other physiological functions of plants fig s2 niu et al 2019 however the increase in gpp is generally greater than et over the qtp meaning that wue also increases with vegetation evi r 0 69 p 0 05 the climatic variables affecting the carbon water coupling are mainly mean atmospheric pressure msp and mean annual temperature mat at the area with high mean atmospheric pressure msp more co2 could be inhaled by plants wang et al 2020 promoting vegetation photosynthesis and growth de kauwe et al 2016 this is evidenced by the positive correlation between msp and gpp r 0 73 p 0 05 over the qtp it has been wildly reported that suitable warming could promote the growth of plants over the qtp quan et al 2018 lin et al 2020 higher temperatures increase enzyme activities in plant photosynthesis and accelerate soil mineralization and organic matter decomposition resulting in a significant increase in plant productivity kim et al 2012 sun et al 2022a warming also enables the melting of snow glaciers and permafrost providing an excellent hydrothermal environment for plant growth jin et al 2021 in contrast et is negatively correlated with mat on the qtp r 0 15 p 0 05 and many experiments and simulation analyses also support these results for example jung et al 2010 found that et had declined due to limited water availability despite the recent warming this could be the result of moisture limitation due to warming which reduced soil evaporation water supply and then soil evaporation quan et al 2018 in addition a high vapor pressure deficit vpd under warming condition causes stomatal closure and a decline of vegetation transpiration rigden and salvucci 2016 4 2 comparison of gpp et and wue in different frozen soil zones this study shows that wue and gpp vary greatly across the different frozen soil zones of the qtp the study found that wue and gpp decrease as the degree of freezing increases while et shows an increase trend fig 6 this pattern may be due to the different sensitivities of the carbon and water couplings to the frozen soil environment in various frozen soil types and the diverse types of dominant vegetation in their regions these differences result in variations in carbon uptake and water use efficiency firstly factors such as the duration and depth of freezing in the frozen soil zone affect the carbon and water cycle of the ecosystem previous studies have shown that most of the meltwater moved downward above the permafrost layer after permafrost thawing and only a small amount of meltwater moved upward due to soil transpiration pressure and capillary action leaving less water available for vegetation yang et al 2013 meanwhile the decrease in soil water content is caused by the increase in active layer depth during the ablation of permafrost on the qinghai tibet plateau and a lower ground temperature could reduce soil cation exchange capacity and nitrogen fig s3a c reducing soil nutrient supply capacity yang et al 2013 whereas the frozen layer of seasonal and short time frozen soils completely melted during the ablation period the short period brought sufficient soil moisture and higher ground temperature to ensure the normal photosynthesis meanwhile sufficient moisture maintains nutrient transport and accelerates the mineralization of soil organic matter which increased soil nutrient content sun et al 2022a secondly differences in environmental variables especially in water and heat fluxes among different frozen soil zones over the qtp profoundly shaped the different vegetation patterns and functions in the regions the appropriate hydrothermal environment is a fundamental condition for vegetation growth niu et al 2008 and suitable temperature ensures soil mineralization and organic matter decomposition and promotes enzyme activity in plant photosynthesis which is more suitable for the domination of trees davidson and janssens 2006 yao et al 2018 for instance the stfg and tsfg frozen soil areas on the southeastern edge of the qtp are shaped by forest shrub dominated ecosystems with high wue and gpp due to good hydrothermal conditions on the contrary because of cold and drought the pcp permafrost region in the northwest of qtp forms an ecosystem dominated by alpine steppe and alpine desert steppe producing low wue and gpp it is also notable that with increasing freezing the mean annual temperature and annual precipitation continuously decrease from stfg to pcp leading to a gradual deterioration of hydrothermal conditions fig s4 which in turn show a gradual decrease in the evi fig s5 in addition the water cycle in different regions of the qtp is significantly influenced by varying hydrogeological conditions for example as the thickness and continuity of frozen soil increases after the transition from mp to pcip and pcp the hydraulic connection and interconversion between its surface water groundwater and atmospheric water gradually decrease cheng and jin 2013 which reduces et according to our results this may be related to the type of vegetation dominating the different zones and the environment where they are located although the areas with short time frozen ground stfg and thin seasonally frozen ground tsfg are located in the zone dominated by forest shrub in the southeast the dense water vapor brought by the indian monsoon reduces the net radiation reaching the surface quan et al 2018 niu et al 2019 leading to low evapotranspiration in these two frozen areas the mtsfg covers the entire eastern part of the qtp and the vegetation type transits from forested scrubland in the southeast to alpine marsh meadows and alpine meadows in the northeast the complete thawing of seasonally frozen ground and water vapor from the east asian monsoon provide sufficient moisture resources for mtsfg furthermore the low cloudiness or high net radiation of alpine marsh meadows and alpine meadows in the northeastern create the highest evapotranspiration in mtsfg the western and mountainous permafrost areas are mainly alpine steppe and desert steppe the water that plants use in this region is mainly the thawing of superficial permafrost meanwhile the high altitude topography and the himalayas together block the water vapor input sun et al 2022b producing characteristics of alpine and arid climates 4 3 influences of climate changes on carbon and water cycles in frozen soil zone a future scenario simulation of the eastern qtp shows that under the rcp4 5 emission scenario mean annual temperature mat could increase at 0 34 c 10a and precipitation could increase by 6 mm 10a this could cause a loss of 23 of permafrost area and a decrease in seasonal permafrost freezing depth of 5 4 cm 10a wang et al 2018 when the active layer increases by 1 cm the annual runoff will decrease by about 1 3 mm and the annual evaporation will increase by about 0 9 mm wang et al 2018 this change could potentially modify the patterns of water carbon coupling in the future therefore continuous observation and modeling of carbon and water cycles in different permafrost types of ecosystems under climate changes is necessary to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of carbon water coupling especially in the regions e g pcp and pcip where the soil will be potentially transferred to another low freezing degree types the influence of frozen soil types could not be ignored because they occupy a large proportion of areas in qtp and the change of frozen soil types may drastically influence the carbon water coupling in qtp 4 4 uncertainties the results in this study provide a deeper understanding of the carbon balance of the qinghai tibet plateau ecosystem however there are still some uncertainties in the study the estimated wue using modis gpp and et products may not be fully satisfactory due to limitations in their own algorithms and input data parameters tang et al 2016 for example the modis gpp product does not consider the contribution of co2 fertilization effect on plant photosynthesis de kauwe et al 2016 which may result in the underestimation of gpp similarly the gpp estimated by satellite remote sensing may overestimate vegetation productivity under drought conditions stocker et al 2019 input data with surface heterogeneity characteristics can also introduce uncertainties in the estimation of modis evi lai and terraclimate vpd data such as moderate or coarse resolution mixed surface cover data which make it difficult to characterize vegetation and micrometeorological features accurately under complex terrain huete et al 2002 yang et al 2006 abatzoglou et al 2018 it is worth noting that the lai variable a modis et driven parameter has estimation errors that pass on to the et products mu et al 2011 for soilgrids250m data the estimated soil variables are published in a static form making it difficult to obtain year by year dynamic information for the study area hengl et al 2017 era5 the latest global fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis data developed by ecmwf has improved the overall accuracy of atmospheric variables compared to the previous era interim series hersbach et al 2020 however for complex regions the stability of era5 may face some challenges one study showed that although era5 precipitation captures the general spatial and temporal characteristics of observed precipitation over the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau mismatches in precipitation onset end times and underestimation of precipitation intensity suggest that uncertainty issues still exist in state of the art model systems hu and yuan 2021 furthermore the stability of the analysis may be affected by the low spatial resolution and data with different scale resolutions therefore an accurate understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns and dynamics of the carbon and water cycles requires a combination of methods such as the introduction of vorticity flux tower observations stable carbon isotope methods and the development of remote sensing data with high spatial resolution meanwhile the weights of environmental factors are ignored in the relative importance analysis and their sensitivity analysis in the results is missing this may limit the generalizability of the analysis results asheghi et al 2020 in addition the frozen soil classification maps used were single period data and does not take into account the changes in the boundaries of different frozen soil types over time therefore further study is needed to consider the dynamics of freezing and to introduce factor weight data and nonlinear analysis methods that include uncertainty quantification functions abbaszadeh shahri et al 2022 5 conclusions a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns and mechanisms of the carbon water coupling in different frozen soil zones on the qtp from 2001 to 2021 based on gpp et and environmental variables data was performed three key conclusions were obtained i consistent spatial patterns were observed for wue and gpp on the qtp while the patterns of et were different the gpp et and wue of qtp and all frozen soil areas showed an increasing trend from 2001 to 2020 ii significant differences were observed between different frozen soil ecosystems for gpp and wue while ets were not significantly different among the three permafrost types as the degree of freezing increases ecosystem carbon fixation and wue decreased while evapotranspiration slightly increases iii the evi was the most important factor affecting gpp and wue in most frozen soil zones while the meteorological factor was the most important factor affecting et in frozen soil zones except mp and pcip the vegetation type factor had the highest influence on the change in wue gpp and et for the largest area in different frozen soil zones followed by the climate type variable and the soil type variable has the least influence this study uncovered the patterns of carbon and water cycling and their significant differences among varying degrees of freezing on the tibetan plateau this difference implied that the transition between different frozen soil types would significantly alter the regional carbon and water cycles and fluxes in the context of a continuously warming climate therefore the effects of frozen soil types cannot be ignored when carrying out carbon and water cycle and flux estimation in terrestrial ecosystems on the tibetan plateau for instance when using various land surface models for predicting ecological

1916,the carbon and water cycle patterns of frozen soil ecosystems in regions such as the qinghai tibet plateau qtp which have fragile and sensitive ecologies are possibly affected by climate change however these patterns along the gradients of varying degrees of freezing remain poorly understood in this study we examine the spatio temporal patterns of water use efficiency wue gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et in six frozen soil zones of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp with varying degrees of frozen soil the analysis is based on the frozen soil classification criteria and remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020 the influences of six climatic nine edaphic and two botanic parameters on these patterns is also investigated the results indicate that 48 05 24 07 and 20 of the regions in qtp exhibit significantly upward trends of gpp et and wue respectively the highest increase trends were observed in gpp in the middle thick seasonally frozen ground zone 2 36 g c m 2 yr 1 et in the mountain permafrost zone 2 35 mm yr 1 and wue in the predominantly continuous permafrost zone 0 003 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 meanwhile gpp and wue decrease progressively with the increase of freezing degrees from the short time frozen ground zone gpp 604 99 51 99 g c m 2 wue 2 34 0 15 g c kg 1 h2o to the predominantly continuous permafrost zone gpp 114 07 11 77 g c m 2 wue 0 33 0 04 g c kg 1 h2o while et does not show significant differences across the three permafrost zones the enhanced vegetation index is the primary factor affecting gpp and wue in most frozen soil zones whereas climate variables mainly impact et our findings emphasize the importance of considering the effects of different freezing degrees of frozen soil when analyzing the response of the carbon and water cycles in the qtp in the context of climate change keywords qinghai tibet plateau water use efficiency frozen soil climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial ecosystems play a crucial role in energy exchange at the earth s critical zone through their carbon and water cycles climate changes significantly impact the carbon and water cycles and alter the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems for instance shifts in vegetation function types and water availability affect ecosystem productivity water use efficiency wue i e the ratio of vegetation productivity to water loss is a critical measure of the carbon and water cycles in ecosystems and an important feature of an ecosystem s functioning it is determined by the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp i e the gross amount of organic carbon fixed by vegetation through photosynthesis per unit of time to evapotranspiration et i e the sum of vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and leaf interception evaporation yu et al 2008 understanding how wue is changing and what drives these changes therefore remains a critical component for understanding the responses of ecosystems under the climate change beer et al 2009 zhu et al 2015 knauer et al 2017 it can also support optimizing regional water resources and developing measures to address the impacts of climate changes qinghai tibetan plateau qtp often referred to as the roof of the world is known to amplify the effects of global climate change wang et al 2022 the low temperature and high altitude of the qtp lead to the widespread distribution of frozen soil wang et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 with areas of permafrost covering about 53 of the region feng et al 2019 the frozen soils have a significant impact on the ecosystems of the qtp which are highly sensitive to climate changes particularly rising temperatures cheng and jin 2013 zhang et al 2016 changes in frozen soils can drastically alter hydrothermal fluxes in the soil and the processes of carbon and water cycles in ecosystems woo et al 2008 however in the qtp there has been a lack of research analyzing the patterns of gpp et and wue across the different frozen soil zones and the factors driving them therefore it is essential to fill the gap in understanding the state of the carbon and water cycles in the frozen qtp soil region climate warming has been shown to have a cumulative effect on terrestrial ecosystem processes in the frozen soil areas davidson and janssens 2006 the degradation of frozen soil alters its physical structure leading to changes in their nutrient and hydrological status which are critical determinants of vegetation functional type and productivity christensen et al 2003 grosse et al 2016 for example jorgenson et al 2001 found that extensive permafrost degradation in central alaska led to a rapid ecosystem shift from forest to bog inevitably altering its regional carbon fluxes yuan et al 2020 found that ecosystems carbon fluxes increase more than water fluxes in the boreal permafrost region of asia during the 1900 2100 primarily due to increasing vegetation activity in the boreal permafrost region notably chen et al 2022 recently used tree annual ring width and stable isotope methods to show that while the permafrost degradation zone enhanced the intrinsic wue of trees tree developmental growth was not significantly promoted however it remains unclear how water and carbon change with different degrees of freezing in the qtp areas in recent years several studies have explored the patterns of the carbon water coupling over the qtp lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 for instance wang et al 2020 discovered that the wue over the qtp increased at a rate of 0 004 g c kg 1h2o yr 1 from 1982 to 2015 due to the combined effects of climate warming and increased precipitation lin et al 2020 used biogeophysical and chemical modeling to assess the wue over qtp showing that the rate of increase in wue was only 0 001 g c kg 1h2o yr 1 from 1979 to 2010 the study concluded that an increase in atmospheric co2 concentration influenced 51 of the change in wue in addition recent studies show that the average annual values of grass wue of qtp significantly increased during 2001 2017 where climate played a significant role liu et al 2021 nonetheless these studies have only focused on an influence of vegetation or climate and have not taken soil properties into account further comprehensive studies are needed to involve more parameters such as higher soil nitrogen n which promotes plant growth and affects the carbon and water cycles of an ecosystem the in situ eddy covariance ec technique is widely regarded as the most reliable approach for measuring ecosystems carbon water cycling directly and accurately at the landscape scale yu et al 2008 however tower based ec measurements suffer from spatial sampling limitations tang et al 2016 as they only provide local information on carbon water fluxes at certain points babaeian et al 2019 remote sensing technology with its capabilities for large scale and high frequency observations offers a useful alternative tool for monitoring regional and even global changes in ecosystems carbon and water cycles scholze et al 2017 most previous studies have used traditional linear regression methods to analyze the factors influencing the carbon and water cycles of ecosystems zhu et al 2015 cristiano et al 2020 however these cycles are driven by many non linear processes the emergence and widespread use of machine learning methods such as neural network models abbaszadeh shahri et al 2021 ghaderi et al 2022 random forest algorithms and support vector machines li et al 2021 provide an effective approach of exploring the non linear relationships between dependent and independent variables this study aims to analyze the patterns and differences of wue gpp and et from 2001 to 2020 in six frozen soil zones over the qtp that have varying degrees of soil freezing in the study we have analyzed remote sensing data and employed machine learning and partial regression methods to identify potential parameters affecting the carbon water coupling of different frozen soil ecosystems based on parameters involving climate soil and vegetation specifically this study will i analyze the spatio temporal patterns of gpp et and wue of regions with different frozen soil types over the qtp from 2001 to 2020 ii compare fluctuations and differences in gpp et and wue based on different frozen soil zones and iii introduce a more comprehensive set of parameters involving climate vegetation and soil factors to determine their impacts on gpp et and wue in the various frozen soil zones of the qtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 1 located at the intersection of the eurasian and indian plates is the highest plateau in the world with a total area of about 2 57 million km2 qiu 2008 and a dense regional water network fig s1 precipitation on the qtp occurs mainly from may to october and decreases in distribution from southeast to northwest due to topographic differences and monsoonal influences ren et al 2021 the plateau is characterized by large diurnal temperature differences and a trend of decreasing temperatures with increasing latitudes and altitudes zhou et al 2021 vertically and horizontally these differences in climate and topography result in a highly uneven distribution of thermal and water conditions over the qtp sun et al 2019 according to the soil taxonomy of usda united states department of agriculture the soil type of the qtp mainly consists of gelisol and inceptisol 2 2 data preparation 2 2 1 gross primary production and

mountain permafrost mp middle thick seasonally frozen ground mtsfg predominantly continuous and island permafrost pcip and predominantly continuous permafrost pcp these classification is based on

frozen soil depth in tsfg does not exceed one meter while the value exceeds one meter for mtsfg permafrost e g pcp pcip and mp is usually soil or rocks that remain frozen for long periods and the average depth ranges from 10 m to around 200 m as for the spatial continuity they are classified into continuous permafrost e g pcp and discontinuous permafrost e g pcip and mp 2 2 3 environmental

data of the 17 factors had 3619 rows and 6804 columns with 24 623 676 pixels the study investigated the series of variables on an annual scale with gpp et and map data being obtained from annual cumulative values and the other time series variables were synthesized as annual averages the data preprocessing was done using r language r core development team vienna austria to ensure that all data are generated in the required coordinate system and resolution 2 3 sample analyses 2 3 1 water use efficiency for ecosystems the water use efficiency wue at the ecosystem scale wueeco is defined as the ratio of gross primary production gpp to evapotranspiration et huang et al 2015 he et al 2017 cristiano et al 2020 kayiranga et al 2020 which reflects the ability of an ecosystem to convert carbon into biomass through water consumption beer et al 2009 knauer et al 2017 i e 1 wue eco gpp et 2 3 2 trend and difference analysis firstly trend analysis is conducted at two scales pixel and regional zheng et al 2019 at the pixel scale annual trends of gpp et and wue on the qtp from 2001 to 2020 were calculated using the theil sen median trend analysis jiang et al 2015 and mann kendall test zou et al 2020 theil sen median is a robust nonparametric statistical trend calculation method the method is computationally efficient and insensitive to measurement errors and outlier data rahman and muhammad 2017 the mann kendall test is a nonparametric test approach which does not require the measurement values to obey a gaussian distribution and is not affected by missing values and outliers fensholt et al 2012 these methods have been widely used to analyze trends of time series data fensholt et al 2012 rahman and muhammad 2017 at the regional scale trends of gpp et and wue were calculated using ordinary least squares zheng et al 2019 secondly stability analysis of time series data based on the coefficient of variation was conducted to evaluate data variation over the time series zhang et al 2022 i e 2 cv σ μ where σ is the standard deviation and μ is the arithmetic mean the larger the cv the more the data fluctuates over time and the more discrete the data distributed is finally a one way analysis of variance anova combined with multiple comparisons tukey hsd non parametric test was used to identify the differences in gpp et and wue among frozen soil types separately 2 3 3 analysis of driving parameters 1 relative importance analysis firstly in the qtp 10 000 random points were set with the number of random points selected according to the percentage of the area of different frozen soil types then the values of gpp et wue and all environmental variables were extracted from these points according to the coordinates in regions with different frozen soil types the data were filtered to remove points with missing values for the variables resulting in a final database of 6358 points the r package used was applied to test the collinearity diagnostics among the environmental variables variables with variance inflation factor vif higher than 10 were considered collinear and thus excluded from the analysis the boruta algorithm kursa and rudnicki 2010 was used with the boruta package in r language to determine the relative importance of variables affecting gpp et and wue for the whole of qinghai tibet plateau and different frozen soil types the boruta algorithm is a wrapper built around the random forest classification algorithm and captures all significant explanatory variables that affect the response variable li et al 2021 2 partial correlation analysis the environmental variables that pass the collinearity diagnostics were classified into three categories climate vegetation and soil principal component analysis awange et al 2018 was then conducted to obtain the first principal components of the climate vegetation and soil factors for the corresponding years partial correlation analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing gpp et and wue on the spatial pattern of the qtp the advantage of this method is that it allows controlling the effects of other explanatory variables when analyzing partial correlations between the response variable and the explanatory variables liu et al 2020 the workflow of this study is summarized in fig 2 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal pattern and variations in gpp et and wue the mean annual gpp over the qinghai tibet plateau is 266 86 16 52 g c m 2 yr 1 and decreases from east to west fig 3 a the gpp decreases gradually from lower to higher latitudes and levels off by 29 n fig 4 a the average annual gpp over the qtp increases at a rate of 1 74 g c m 2 yr 1 for the 2001 2020 period r2 0 37 p 0 004 fig 5 a with a significant increasing trend of 48 05 in the vegetation areas located in the central eastern region fig 3d only a small portion 0 75 of the vegetation areas show a significant decrease in gpp primarily in the southwest fig 3d interannual fluctuation of gpp on the qtp is only visible in the central southern areas fig 3g the mean annual et from the qtp is 355 89 17 96 mm yr 1 fig 3b et values are generally lower at high latitudes compared to those at middle or low latitudes with a peak observed around 35 n and 28 n fig 4b interannual variation from 2001 to 2020 shows an increase in et at a trend of 1 50 mm yr 1 per year r2 0 23 p 0 032 fig 5b the significant p 0 05 increasing and decreasing trends in et occur in the northeastern and mid western part of qtp respectively accounting for 24 07 and 1 34 of the vegetation area fig 3e the stability of et is higher overall in the northern regions of the qtp than other areas fig 3h the annual mean wue over qtp is 0 81 0 04 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 fig 3c the spatial distribution and latitudinal pattern of mean annual wue are consistent with the pattern of gpp with the highest annual wue at the southeastern edge of qtp at low latitudes fig 3c 4c inter annual variations in wue increases at a rate of 0 0017 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 r2 0 05 but the trend is not significant fig 5c a significant increasing trend is observed in about 20 of the vegetated areas mainly in the central part of the plateau while only 4 47 of the area experiences a significant decrease p 0 05 fig 3f the increase of wue in the central part of qtp is mainly due to a decrease in et and an increase of gpp in these locations however the increase of wue in the northeast may be due to a faster increase of gpp than et conversely the decrease in et and the increase in gpp lead to an increase in wue along the southeastern fringe of the qtp the stability of qtp water use efficiency fluctuates widely in the southwest and northwest from 2001 to 2020 fig 3i table 2 provides details of the carbon and water cycles over the qinghai tibet plateau and different frozen soil zones from 2001 to 2020 3 2 gpp et and wue variations among zones of frozen soil the growth rate of gpp is 2 12 g c m 2 yr 1 in short time frozen ground and in thin seasonally frozen ground the value is 2 34 g c m 2 yr 1 although the trend is not significant the largest significant positive trend in gpp is observed in middle thick seasonally frozen ground 2 36 g c m 2 yr 1 followed by mountain permafrost 1 57 g c m 2 yr 1 predominantly continuous permafrost 1 35 g c m 2 yr 1 and predominantly continuous and island permafrost 1 25 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 5a the greatest significant positive trend in et is observed in zones with mp 2 35 mm yr 1 followed by mtsfg 2 21 mm yr 1 and pcip 1 36 mm yr 1 while the increasing trend in other permafrost zones is not significant fig 5b the only zone in the qtp that shows a significant increasing trend in wue is the pct type with an increasing rate of 0 003 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 fig 5c the interannual fluctuations in gpp et and wue show consistent regularity in all frozen soil zones fig 5 significant differences in average gpp et and wue are observed among the different frozen soil zones there are overall decreasing trends of gpp and wue as the degree of freezing increases fig 6 a c stfg and pcp have the lowest and highest freezing levels corresponding to the highest and lowest gpp stfg 604 99 51 99 g c m 2 pcp 114 07 11 77 g c m 2 and the highest and lowest wue stfg 2 34 0 15 g c kg 1 h2o pcp 0 33 0 04 g c kg 1 h2o respectively there is no clear trend in et along the degree of freezing fig 6b with the lowest et 293 59 20 55 mm for stfg and the highest 379 91 22 76 mm in mtsfg furthermore unlike other frozen soil types the higher gpp and lower et of stfg lead to a higher wue 3 3 effects of environmental factors on carbon water coupling the vif variance inflation factor for the environmental factors including mean annual temperature mat 4 17 mean annual precipitation

clay clay 1 55 soil silt silt 1 88 and enhanced vegetation index evi 2 62 are all 10 thus the collinearity diagnostics indicate that these environmental factors can be used for subsequent analyses the assessment of relative importance shows that evi msp and mat are all the top three most important variables explaining changes in gpp and wue on the qtp fig 7 a c in contrast mat is the most important independent variable affecting et while evi and mws are the second and third most important variables respectively fig 7b consistently the most important variable influencing the changes in gpp for all the six frozen soil types is evi fig 8 a f evi is also the most important variable for explaining wue for the five frozen soil types tsfg mtsfg mp pcip and pcp the most important variable in stfg wue is msp while evi still has a relatively high importance fig 8m r in the areas with mp and pcip evi is the most important variable in explaining et the most important variables influencing et in the stfg tsfg mtsfg and pcp frozen soil regions are map map mat and msp respectively fig 8g l partial correlation analysis suggests that vegetation factors control over 44 72 and 62 of the area over the qtp for the variations of gpp et and wue respectively followed by climate gpp 31 et 18 wue 27 and soil factors gpp 25 et 10 wue 11 fig 9 the areas with dominating vegetation factors are mainly distributed in the eastern and marginal regions for the gpp and the central and eastern parts for et while the vegetation dominating area is more dispersed for the wue for climatic factors the dominating areas are mainly concentrated in the western part for et and wue soil factors mainly have a dominating influence in the northern part for gpp et and wue in the different frozen soil regions vegetation remains the main factor influencing the carbon and water cycles except in 41 of the pcip region where meteorological factors dominate still 38 of the area is subject to vegetation factors the areas controlled by soil factors remain small for gpp et and wue table 3 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal patterns of carbon water coupling on the qinghai tibet plateau the annual average gpp over the qinghai tibet plateau shows a similar spatial distribution to wue fig 3a c while the annual mean et does not exhibit a similar trend fig 3b gpp and wue show gradual decreases with the increases of freezing degrees while et does not show this obvious pattern figs 5 6 the dominant role of gpp on wue is also supported by the similar patterns of gpp and wue along the gradient of latitude while et does not show this similar pattern fig 4 the dominant role of gpp is in accordance with the results of wang et al 2020 over the qtp region from 1982 to 2015 though the year of the study differs liu et al 2020 suggested that gpp dominated the variation of wue mainly in moist regions but this is also true for the semi arid and semi humid regions of the qtp temporally this study finds that the wue on the qinghai tibet plateau has a slight and insignificant increase from 2001 to 2020 with a growth rate of 0 002 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 p 0 05 this result is in accordance with a recent finding using carbon isotopes technology which showed that a global increasing trend of wue has slowed down adams et al 2020 although some studies suggested that the wue calculated from isotopes are overestimated marchand et al 2020 gong et al 2022 the conclusion that the rate of increase of wue is slowing is still reasonable because the modification changes the wue in the same direction for each year the insignificant increase in wue is related to the simultaneous increase of gpp and et the average annual gpp has increased significantly at 1 74 g c m 2 yr 1 from 2001 to 2020 over the qtp which is greater than the growth ratio 1 01 g c m 2 yr 1 from 1987 to 2013 ma et al 2017 however the growth ratio of et in the same period is also high 1 5 mm y 1 as confirmed by a previous study which showed a significant increase in et by 21 56 for the regions in qtp from 1982 to 2015 yang 2020 vegetation and climate factors are the main variables that drive the variability of carbon water coupling over the qtp figs 7 8 9 increased vegetation cover enhanced vegetation index evi reflects the growth of vegetation and gpp usually increases with the increasing of evi rahman et al 2005 this analysis is supported by a significant linear relation between evi and gpp r 0 88 p 0 05 fig s2 meanwhile evi also significantly promotes et r 0 40 p 0 05 as more water is required to fulfill the transportation of nutrition and other physiological functions of plants fig s2 niu et al 2019 however the increase in gpp is generally greater than et over the qtp meaning that wue also increases with vegetation evi r 0 69 p 0 05 the climatic variables affecting the carbon water coupling are mainly mean atmospheric pressure msp and mean annual temperature mat at the area with high mean atmospheric pressure msp more co2 could be inhaled by plants wang et al 2020 promoting vegetation photosynthesis and growth de kauwe et al 2016 this is evidenced by the positive correlation between msp and gpp r 0 73 p 0 05 over the qtp it has been wildly reported that suitable warming could promote the growth of plants over the qtp quan et al 2018 lin et al 2020 higher temperatures increase enzyme activities in plant photosynthesis and accelerate soil mineralization and organic matter decomposition resulting in a significant increase in plant productivity kim et al 2012 sun et al 2022a warming also enables the melting of snow glaciers and permafrost providing an excellent hydrothermal environment for plant growth jin et al 2021 in contrast et is negatively correlated with mat on the qtp r 0 15 p 0 05 and many experiments and simulation analyses also support these results for example jung et al 2010 found that et had declined due to limited water availability despite the recent warming this could be the result of moisture limitation due to warming which reduced soil evaporation water supply and then soil evaporation quan et al 2018 in addition a high vapor pressure deficit vpd under warming condition causes stomatal closure and a decline of vegetation transpiration rigden and salvucci 2016 4 2 comparison of gpp et and wue in different frozen soil zones this study shows that wue and gpp vary greatly across the different frozen soil zones of the qtp the study found that wue and gpp decrease as the degree of freezing increases while et shows an increase trend fig 6 this pattern may be due to the different sensitivities of the carbon and water couplings to the frozen soil environment in various frozen soil types and the diverse types of dominant vegetation in their regions these differences result in variations in carbon uptake and water use efficiency firstly factors such as the duration and depth of freezing in the frozen soil zone affect the carbon and water cycle of the ecosystem previous studies have shown that most of the meltwater moved downward above the permafrost layer after permafrost thawing and only a small amount of meltwater moved upward due to soil transpiration pressure and capillary action leaving less water available for vegetation yang et al 2013 meanwhile the decrease in soil water content is caused by the increase in active layer depth during the ablation of permafrost on the qinghai tibet plateau and a lower ground temperature could reduce soil cation exchange capacity and nitrogen fig s3a c reducing soil nutrient supply capacity yang et al 2013 whereas the frozen layer of seasonal and short time frozen soils completely melted during the ablation period the short period brought sufficient soil moisture and higher ground temperature to ensure the normal photosynthesis meanwhile sufficient moisture maintains nutrient transport and accelerates the mineralization of soil organic matter which increased soil nutrient content sun et al 2022a secondly differences in environmental variables especially in water and heat fluxes among different frozen soil zones over the qtp profoundly shaped the different vegetation patterns and functions in the regions the appropriate hydrothermal environment is a fundamental condition for vegetation growth niu et al 2008 and suitable temperature ensures soil mineralization and organic matter decomposition and promotes enzyme activity in plant photosynthesis which is more suitable for the domination of trees davidson and janssens 2006 yao et al 2018 for instance the stfg and tsfg frozen soil areas on the southeastern edge of the qtp are shaped by forest shrub dominated ecosystems with high wue and gpp due to good hydrothermal conditions on the contrary because of cold and drought the pcp permafrost region in the northwest of qtp forms an ecosystem dominated by alpine steppe and alpine desert steppe producing low wue and gpp it is also notable that with increasing freezing the mean annual temperature and annual precipitation continuously decrease from stfg to pcp leading to a gradual deterioration of hydrothermal conditions fig s4 which in turn show a gradual decrease in the evi fig s5 in addition the water cycle in different regions of the qtp is significantly influenced by varying hydrogeological conditions for example as the thickness and continuity of frozen soil increases after the transition from mp to pcip and pcp the hydraulic connection and interconversion between its surface water groundwater and atmospheric water gradually decrease cheng and jin 2013 which reduces et according to our results this may be related to the type of vegetation dominating the different zones and the environment where they are located although the areas with short time frozen ground stfg and thin seasonally frozen ground tsfg are located in the zone dominated by forest shrub in the southeast the dense water vapor brought by the indian monsoon reduces the net radiation reaching the surface quan et al 2018 niu et al 2019 leading to low evapotranspiration in these two frozen areas the mtsfg covers the entire eastern part of the qtp and the vegetation type transits from forested scrubland in the southeast to alpine marsh meadows and alpine meadows in the northeast the complete thawing of seasonally frozen ground and water vapor from the east asian monsoon provide sufficient moisture resources for mtsfg furthermore the low cloudiness or high net radiation of alpine marsh meadows and alpine meadows in the northeastern create the highest evapotranspiration in mtsfg the western and mountainous permafrost areas are mainly alpine steppe and desert steppe the water that plants use in this region is mainly the thawing of superficial permafrost meanwhile the high altitude topography and the himalayas together block the water vapor input sun et al 2022b producing characteristics of alpine and arid climates 4 3 influences of climate changes on carbon and water cycles in frozen soil zone a future scenario simulation of the eastern qtp shows that under the rcp4 5 emission scenario mean annual temperature mat could increase at 0 34 c 10a and precipitation could increase by 6 mm 10a this could cause a loss of 23 of permafrost area and a decrease in seasonal permafrost freezing depth of 5 4 cm 10a wang et al 2018 when the active layer increases by 1 cm the annual runoff will decrease by about 1 3 mm and the annual evaporation will increase by about 0 9 mm wang et al 2018 this change could potentially modify the patterns of water carbon coupling in the future therefore continuous observation and modeling of carbon and water cycles in different permafrost types of ecosystems under climate changes is necessary to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of carbon water coupling especially in the regions e g pcp and pcip where the soil will be potentially transferred to another low freezing degree types the influence of frozen soil types could not be ignored because they occupy a large proportion of areas in qtp and the change of frozen soil types may drastically influence the carbon water coupling in qtp 4 4 uncertainties the results in this study provide a deeper understanding of the carbon balance of the qinghai tibet plateau ecosystem however there are still some uncertainties in the study the estimated wue using modis gpp and et products may not be fully satisfactory due to limitations in their own algorithms and input data parameters tang et al 2016 for example the modis gpp product does not consider the contribution of co2 fertilization effect on plant photosynthesis de kauwe et al 2016 which may result in the underestimation of gpp similarly the gpp estimated by satellite remote sensing may overestimate vegetation productivity under drought conditions stocker et al 2019 input data with surface heterogeneity characteristics can also introduce uncertainties in the estimation of modis evi lai and terraclimate vpd data such as moderate or coarse resolution mixed surface cover data which make it difficult to characterize vegetation and micrometeorological features accurately under complex terrain huete et al 2002 yang et al 2006 abatzoglou et al 2018 it is worth noting that the lai variable a modis et driven parameter has estimation errors that pass on to the et products mu et al 2011 for soilgrids250m data the estimated soil variables are published in a static form making it difficult to obtain year by year dynamic information for the study area hengl et al 2017 era5 the latest global fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis data developed by ecmwf has improved the overall accuracy of atmospheric variables compared to the previous era interim series hersbach et al 2020 however for complex regions the stability of era5 may face some challenges one study showed that although era5 precipitation captures the general spatial and temporal characteristics of observed precipitation over the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau mismatches in precipitation onset end times and underestimation of precipitation intensity suggest that uncertainty issues still exist in state of the art model systems hu and yuan 2021 furthermore the stability of the analysis may be affected by the low spatial resolution and data with different scale resolutions therefore an accurate understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns and dynamics of the carbon and water cycles requires a combination of methods such as the introduction of vorticity flux tower observations stable carbon isotope methods and the development of remote sensing data with high spatial resolution meanwhile the weights of environmental factors are ignored in the relative importance analysis and their sensitivity analysis in the results is missing this may limit the generalizability of the analysis results asheghi et al 2020 in addition the frozen soil classification maps used were single period data and does not take into account the changes in the boundaries of different frozen soil types over time therefore further study is needed to consider the dynamics of freezing and to introduce factor weight data and nonlinear analysis methods that include uncertainty quantification functions abbaszadeh shahri et al 2022 5 conclusions a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns and mechanisms of the carbon water coupling in different frozen soil zones on the qtp from 2001 to 2021 based on gpp et and environmental variables data was performed three key conclusions were obtained i consistent spatial patterns were observed for wue and gpp on the qtp while the patterns of et were different the gpp et and wue of qtp and all frozen soil areas showed an increasing trend from 2001 to 2020 ii significant differences were observed between different frozen soil ecosystems for gpp and wue while ets were not significantly different among the three permafrost types as the degree of freezing increases ecosystem carbon fixation and wue decreased while evapotranspiration slightly increases iii the evi was the most important factor affecting gpp and wue in most frozen soil zones while the meteorological factor was the most important factor affecting et in frozen soil zones except mp and pcip the vegetation type factor had the highest influence on the change in wue gpp and et for the largest area in different frozen soil zones followed by the climate type variable and the soil type variable has the least influence this study uncovered the patterns of carbon and water cycling and their significant differences among varying degrees of freezing on the tibetan plateau this difference implied that the transition between different frozen soil types would significantly alter the regional carbon and water cycles and fluxes in the context of a continuously warming climate therefore the effects of frozen soil types cannot be ignored when carrying out carbon and water cycle and flux estimation in terrestrial ecosystems on the tibetan plateau for instance when using various land surface models for predicting ecological

1917,in the inverse estimation of groundwater model parameters e g contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields data assimilation is the most commonly used method for solving the inverse problem however data assimilation requires iterative calculation which tends to increase the computational costs this is particularly problematic when dealing with high dimensional problems in this study we propose a hybrid inversion framework which combines a generative adversarial network gan and a convolutional neural network cnn for groundwater model parameter estimation the gan is equipped with gradient penalties wgan gp to achieve fast characterization of high dimensional aquifer structures with low dimensional vectors 200 dimensions meanwhile this study proposes an enhanced convolutional neural network oanw which introduces two layer weights near the contamination source to achieve an effective surrogate of the process based groundwater model moreover an iterative local update ensemble smoother ilues is applied for simultaneous identification of the contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields in the inversion stage the results demonstrate that by integrating wgan gp and oanw the ilues framework accurately characterizes the aquifer parameters and significantly improves the efficiency of the computational process keywords groundwater inverse

oanw ilues the inversion framework containing the wgan gp generative model and the oanw surrogate model 1 introduction in research related to groundwater contamination management it is advantageous to clarify the release history of the contamination source and hydraulic conductivity of the contaminated site to identify the location and duration of contamination however this information is often difficult to obtain directly and usually requires inversion calculation from observation data this is a typical groundwater inverse problem for inverse problems the results are significantly dependent on the accurate description of the hydraulic conductivity field in addition the prediction of the contamination plume in the subsequent contamination treatment is substantially influenced by the accuracy of the hydraulic conductivity field characterization geostatistical modeling methods are typically employed to characterize the hydraulic conductivity field which infer the heterogeneity of the entire site from a small amount of measurement data hard data and a priori spatial statistical information in the site zheng et al 2020 however geostatistical modeling methods such as sgsim deutsch and journel 1998 have two main limitations first direct measurements are usually sparse when the sites are highly heterogeneous there is a large uncertainty in the area without measurement data making it difficult to obtain satisfactory results jiang et al 2022 second geostatistical methods require a significant amount of computational resources when performing detailed site characterization based on priori statistical information for example the time complexity of the method reaches o n 3 when estimating n points cormen et al 2009 indicating that the computational cost increases considerably with the number of points to be estimated which is undesirable for large scale applications in order to address the issue that very few observations of hydraulic conductivity affect the overall characteristics of the contaminated site data assimilation methods calculate the inverse of the hydraulic conductivity field using indirect observations e g hydraulic head and contaminant concentration data the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and its variants ensemble smoother es li et al 2018 and iterative ensemble smoother ies chen and oliver 2012 are widely used in hydrogeological research kang et al 2021 li et al 2012 schöniger et al 2012 based on ies zhang et al 2018 proposed an iterative local updating ensemble smoother ilues the ilues method improves the computational efficiency of inverting high dimensional system by utilizing a local update strategy of the sampled ensemble to update the parameters numerous research results demonstrate that ilues can significantly reduce the uncertainty of model parameter estimation yang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 many researchers have conducted studies to enhance the computational efficiency of geostatistical methods for characterizing aquifers such as reducing the computational complexity by mathematically transforming the form tzeng and huang 2018 only considering the points around the visiting point stein 2002 and employing multi core parallel computation rasera et al 2015 in recent years the application of deep learning dl in hydrogeology has gradually increased bai and tahmasebi coupled physical conditions with deep learning and proposed the piml framework that can significantly reduce the computational time of sgsim bai and tahmasebi 2022 jardani et al 2022 designed the algorithm called cnn ht to predict the inverse operator of hydraulic tomography using a synthetic training dataset which include the hydraulic head data associated with pumping tests zhou and tartakovsky 2021 proposed a markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach that uses samples from a cnn surrogate of a pde based model which was used to reconstruct contaminant release history from sparse and noisy measurements of solute concentration liu and durlofsky 2021 combined convolutional neural network cnn and principal component analysis pca to effectively characterize high dimensional complex aquifer features in addition generative adversarial networks gan are increasingly used for aquifer structure characterization azevedo et al 2020 chan and elsheikh 2020 mosser et al 2017 dupont et al 2018 used gan to construct a model that follows a physical measurement mechanism which can rapidly and efficiently characterize complex geological models laloy et al 2018 used the spatial generative adversarial neural network sgan to characterize two dimensional channelized aquifers and combined it with markov chain monte carlo mcmc to characterize aquifer structure zhan et al 2022 used a geological single sample generative adversarial network geosingan to characterize the heterogeneous structure of the aquifer and then combined it with ilues for characterizing aquifer structure in the aforementioned studies gans are mainly employed to characterize the heterogeneous structure of complicated aquifers serving as stochastic simulators for such aquifers a few studies have integrated gan into groundwater inversion problems for identifying hydraulic conductivity chan and elsheikh 2019 razak and jafarpour 2022 proposed two approaches to generate non gaussian patterns with conditioning generative adversarial network cgan pan et al 2022 utilized a deep convolutional cycle generative adversarial neural network dc cgan to directly estimate the hydraulic conductivity field and compared with the indirect approaches sun et al 2023 employed gan to reproduce the complex meandering multi facies distributions however to the best of our knowledge there has been no studies thus far that combines gan to estimate aquifer parameters and other model parameters simultaneously e g contaminant source information using data assimilation for high dimensional inverse simulation requires repeated executions of the groundwater model by constructing a surrogate model of the numerical groundwater model it is possible to further improve the computational efficiency zhang et al 2016 among popular surrogate models the deep neural networks dnns have gained the attention of many researchers through reasonable design of the hidden layers of dnns surrogate models could provide accurate alternative representations of complex process based models may be obtained for example mo et al 2019a transformed the task into an image to image regression problem and constructed a surrogate model with a dense convolutional network densenet structure which was applied to the multiphase flow simulation of co2 geological storage tang et al 2021 2020 developed a surrogate model based on deep convolutional and recurrent neural network rnn structure and applied it to predict dynamic subsurface flow in a channelized geological model in our study a generative model is employed to characterize the aquifer structure to achieve simultaneous inversion of hydraulic conductivity field and contaminant source parameters to rapidly and accurately characterize high dimensional aquifer structure with low dimensional inputs a novel inversion framework is proposed which employs wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty wgan gp in addition we extend the ar net wl surrogate model mo et al 2019b by incorporating dual weight layers at the outer edge of the contaminant source the proposed model named oanw optimized ar net wl can effectively capture the strong nonlinearity and complexity of the concentration field near the contaminant source finally by integrating wgan gp and oanw into the ilues inversion framework the resulting framework is capable of executing fast and effective model parameter estimation using a limited amount of observation data hydraulic head and contaminant concentration data 2 methods in this section the groundwater contamination transport model is first introduced in section 2 1 followed by the integrated ilues inversion framework in addition to the ilues method module in section 2 2 the inversion framework in section 2 5 also includes two important components in section 2 3 and 2 4 a gan wgan gp for generating complex hydraulic conductivity field and a novel surrogate model optimized ar net wl oanw for groundwater contaminant transport model 2 1 groundwater contaminant transport model this study considers contaminant transport under steady state groundwater flow conditions assuming that advection and dispersion are the dominant transport processes notably the reaction term is not considered in this study the governing equation of steady state groundwater flow is as follows harbaugh et al 2000 1 k h 0 2 v k θ h where k lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head θ is the porosity of the aquifer medium and v lt 1 is the pore space flow velocity the groundwater solute transport equation is as follows zheng and wang 1999 3 θ c t θ d c θ v c q s c s where c ml 3 is the concentration of contaminant d l2t 1 is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion tensor v lt 1 is the velocity in the aquifer medium q s t 1 is the flow rate of the source sink term per unit volume of the aquifer and c s ml 3 is the concentration of source sink term 2 2 ilues method zhang et al 2018 in this study ilues is adopted as the inversion method for groundwater inverse problems a brief description of the ilues method is provided herein for simplicity the relationship between uncertain model parameters e g hydraulic conductivities contaminant source information and measurements e g observed hydraulic head and contaminant concentration can be expressed in the following form 4 d f m ε where d is a vector of measurements m is a vector of uncertain model parameters f m denotes the forward model with uncertain parameters m and ε is a vector of measurement errors ilues introduces a local updating scheme in contrast to the ensemble smoother es to better deal with high dimensional and strongly nonlinear problems and assimilates the available observation data for multiple times ilues initially updates the local set j m of ne samples for the uncertain groundwater model parameters m 5 j m j 1 m j 1 max j 2 m j 2 max where j 1 m f m d t c d 1 f m d is the distance between model predictions f m and observations d j 2 m m m j f t c mm 1 m m j f is the distance between model parameter m and the corresponding samples m j f c d is the covariance matrix of observation errors and c mm is the autocovariance matrix of model parameters j 1 max and j 2 max are the maximum values of j 1 m and j 2 m respectively ilues then selects the n smallest j m values and the corresponding sample parameter m j f is defined as the local sample m j l f of the parameter this parameter is updated according to the following formula 6 m j i a m j i f c md l f c dd l f c d 1 d j f m j i f where c md l f is the cross covariance matrix of m j l f m j 1 f m j 2 f m j n l f and d j l f g m j 1 f g m j 2 f g m j n l f c dd l f is the autocovariance matrix of d j l f and d j d ε is the observed true value d after introducing errors ε as the update result for parameter m j f a random sample value is selected after each update of the local samples the above update process is applied to n e sets of parameter samples and the overall update result m a m 1 l a m 2 l a m n e l a of parameter m is finally obtained a more detailed explanation of iterative local updating ensemble smoother ilues can be found in zhang s research zhang et al 2018 2 3 wgan gp in this study wgan gp is adopted to generate complex hydraulic conductivity fields for groundwater inverse problems a brief description of the wgan gp architecture is provided as follows generative adversarial network gan is proposed by goodfellow et al 2014 using two neural networks generator g and discriminator d for adversarial training in terms of hydrogeology trained generators can quickly characterize aquifer parameters the generator accepts a low dimensional vector z as input and attempts to generate the output g z that matches the features of the training data the discriminator takes g z and training data as input and analyzes the error between them then it gives a score as the output the greater the score the closer the g z matches the target distribution both continuously minimize the following loss functions during the training process goodfellow et al 2014 7 min g max d v d g e x p data x l o g d x e z p z z log 1 d g z where p data x denotes the training data and p z z denotes the low dimensional input satisfying a specific distribution often uniform or gaussian in the process of training the generator frequently encounters the problem of gradient disappearance which prevents the model from changing to a better direction in addition the generator is susceptible to mode collapse problem when the discriminator of the original gan reaches near optimality gulrajani et al 2017 to address the aforementioned issues arjovsky et al 2017 proposed wasserstein gan wgan by enhancing the original gan with the wasserstein distance the wasserstein distance function of wgan gp is as follows 8 w p data x p z z sup d l 1 e x p data x d x e z p z z d z however since wgan adopts a weight clipping strategy to enforce the lipschitz constraint on d the weights in d tend to be close to the clipping bound to enable d to learn a more uniform weight distribution gulrajani et al 2017 added gradient penalty to wgan thereby proposing a generative adversarial network wgan gp the loss function in wgan gp is as follows 9 l e x p data x d x e z p z z d g z λ e x p x x d x 2 1 2 where x d x represents the gradient of d and λ represents the gradient constraint weight in this study wgan gp is adopted to construct a generative model of aquifer structure fig 1 the vector z 200 dimensions in the latter case with gaussian distribution is used as the input of g the hydraulic conductivity field training set obtained by sequential gaussian simulation sgs nussbaumer et al 2018 and the hydraulic conductivity field g z generated by g are both taken as the input of d after training the generator could quickly generate hydraulic conductivity field realizations that may approximate the actual model 2 4 oanw surrogate model cnn based models usually adopt an image to image framework to establish a complex nonlinear relationship between the input and the output images as shown in fig 2 the former contains hydraulic conductivity field k and contaminant source strength si and the latter consists of hydraulic head h and contaminant concentration field ci this cnn based surrogate model is described as 10 input k s i n t o u t p u t h c i n t where i 1 2 3 n t and n t is the number of stress periods in this study a novel surrogate model optimized ar net wl oanw was proposed for the groundwater contaminant transport model the optimized ar net wl oanw is an improved network structure based on mo s ar net wl mo et al 2019a which is composed of densenet a brief description is as follows densenet is used to construct a surrogate model for the groundwater contaminant transport model consisting of dense block and transition layer in contrast to the connection method of conventional neural networks dense block connects not only adjacent but also non adjacent network layers this connection method can effectively reduce the information loss caused by the network information transmission process which is expressed as encblock and decblock in the encoder and decoder respectively in fig 2 the connection mode of dense blocks however causes an explosion in the number of feature maps of network output as the number of network layers increases to solve this problem transition layers are used to connect dense blocks to reduce the number and dimensions of feature maps the concentration field usually exhibits large gradients in regions near the source of the contaminant which frequently results in large approximation errors liao et al 2017 since the deep convolutional neural network is an image based machine learning classification model processing images with local nonlinear features is challenging it brings difficulty for the surrogate model to produce accurate results especially in the case of inadequate training data similar to mo s research in order to improve the accuracy of the network surrogate model in the vicinity of the contaminant source a network structure optimized ar net wl oanw is proposed to optimize the weight loss function the specific improvement is illustrated in fig 3 during the stress period of contaminant release the source grid and its surrounding 8 grids serve as the first weight layer while the 16 grids next to the first weight layer are designated as the second weight layer the losses of the first and second weight layers are calculated to obtain ζ1 and ζ2 and the loss functions are derived by assigning the extra weights w1 and w2 to the first and second weight layers respectively the optimized l 1 loss function can be expressed as follows 11 l wl θ l θ l w 1 θ l w 2 θ 12 l wi w i i 1 n t c si c si i 1 2 where l θ is the original l1 loss function c si is the original contaminant concentration field c si is the model prediction of c si and w i denotes the weight with w1 8 and w2 4 in this case the discussion of weights can be found in mo s research mo et al 2019a 2 5 ilues inversion framework the general framework of the ilues data assimilation method incorporating the wgan gp generative model and the oanw surrogate model hereafter referred to as the surrogate model is shown in fig 4 and the main steps are as follows 1 training the generator g and the surrogate model based on training data respectively 2 randomly generate ne group z that conforms to the gaussian distribution then sample from the prior distribution to obtain the ne group contamination source parameters si 3 input z into g to obtain the estimated field of hydraulic conductivity field k field in fig 4 and use g z and si as inputs to the substitution model to obtain the simulated observations of the ne group samples 4 using ilues update ne group z and si by simulated observations and observed reference values 5 repeat steps 3 and 4 for the updated z and si until the predetermined number of iterations has been reached 3 case study 3 1 problem description as depicted in fig 5 a two dimensional steady state groundwater flow through an isotropic heterogeneous confined aquifer is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed inversion framework provided in section 2 the confined aquifer 32 m 20 m is divided into 65 by 41 square grids cells with a cell size of 0 5 m the top and bottom boundaries are no flux the west and east boundaries are enforced with constant hydraulic heads of 11 m and 10 m respectively the hydraulic conductivity field is assumed to satisfy a log normal distribution with prescribed mean lnk 3 0 and variance σ l n k 2 1 0 the correlation lengths in the and y directions are 9 6 m and 6 0 m respectively the variogram type is exponential the contaminant source in fig 5 with time varying strength is considered in this case and the contaminant is released during each stress period the duration of the entire simulation is 40 days which is divided into an average of 8 stress periods the contaminant source strength parameters including prior information and reference values are listed in table 1 the porosity of the aquifer is 0 30 the longitudinal dispersivity is 2 0 m and the transverse dispersivity is 0 6 m in this case the parameters to be estimated are the hydraulic conductivity field and contaminant source strength note that the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field has a dimension of 2665 65 41 based on the degree of grid subdivision at the site however with the use of wgan gp to reduce the dimensionality of the hydraulic conductivity field only a low dimensional input 200 dimensional is required for inversion to estimate these uncertain model parameters 15 observation wells are arranged at the contaminated site the hydraulic head and contaminant concentration at the end of each stress period are collected as observation data yielding a total of 135 15 15 8 135 data points 3 2 assessment criteria to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the surrogate model and parameter inversion results root mean square error rmse and normalized absolute error of estimation naee are introduced 13 rmse 1 n e i 1 n e y i y i 2 14 naee i 1 n k q k e q k a i 1 n k q k a 100 where n e denotes the total number of test samples y i represents the process based groundwater model output of the sample and y i represents the surrogate model prediction result of the sample q k a represents the reference value of source strength in the kth stress period q k e represents the estimated source strength in the kth stress period the smaller rmse is the higher the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model the smaller naee is the closer the parameter inversion approaches the reference value 4 results and discussion in the modified ilues inversion framework the wgan gp generator for the hydraulic conductivity field and the oanw surrogate model for the contaminant transport model are trained separately before applying ilues method to simultaneously estimate these uncertain model parameters the hydraulic conductivity field and contaminant source strength in this section we first evaluate the validity of the trained generator and surrogate model to assess the model results and then analyze the inversion results by discussing the ensemble number ne 4 1 performance of wgan gp generator in this study the low dimensional input satisfying the gaussian distribution n 0 1 can be transformed into the output that matches the characteristics of the training data hydraulic conductivity field by using the trained wgan gp generator the optimal generator is determined by comparing the effects of different hyperparameters the hyperparameters of the discriminator and generator are 4 315 200 and 4317824 respectively of gans on model results the activity function for each layer in wgan gp is leaky relu for the generator and relu for the discriminator the size of training data is 30000 and the batch size is 64 the optimizer is adam learning rate is 0 0001 for generator and 0 0002 for discriminator the wgan gp and oanw models used in this work are developed under the pytorch framework training is performed on an nvidia geforce gtx 1660 ti gpu the statistical distribution of 50 randomly selected realizations from the generator is shown in fig 6 as can be observed the statistical distribution of mean and variance for the generated results strongly agrees with the training set in terms of generation time the trained generator takes only 0 237 s to generate 50 sets of hydraulic conductivity fields with prescribed statistical characteristics fig 7 shows the variograms of the 50 randomly selected hydraulic conductivity fields generated with the sgs simulator the results indicate that the wgan gp generator efficiently captures the variogram features of the training data combining fig 6 and fig 7 the trained generator can effectively characterize the structural features of heterogeneous aquifers 4 2 performance of oanw surrogate model in this study oanw a modified ar net wl is proposed to construct a surrogate model for contaminant transport model the activity function for each layer is relu and the training data batch size is 16 the optimizer is adam learning rate is 0 0002 in addition to network structure the size of training data and number of iterations have a significant impact on the performance of the oanw surrogate model three different sizes of training data 1000 2000 and 3000 are considered the testing dataset consists of 500 randomly generated testing samples in this study the training data and test data for the oanw surrogate model are obtained from two existing numerical models modflow for simulating groundwater flow and mt3dms for simulating mass transport inputs to these models include the hydraulic conductivity field and the contaminant source strength the former is generated by wgan gp whereas the latter is randomly sampled within a predefined range in table 1 the outputs of the modflow mt3dms model are the spatial temporal field of hydraulic head and contaminant concentration this study does not use separate validation data but instead the optimal oanw surrogate model which performed the best on the test dataset is used for the inversion of reference values to evaluate its performance in numerical cases fig 8 depicts the estimation accuracy rmse of the surrogate model as the size of training data and the number of iterations epoch increases when the number of iterations is 200 as shown in fig 8 the surrogate model converges and performs stably on the training data for the testing set the error of the surrogate model severely fluctuates with 1000 training samples although the overall rmse remains less than 0 20 when the size of the training data is 2000 or 3000 the training error of the surrogate model is small and there is no significant difference between the two training error values taking into account the training time the training time of 1000 2000 and 3000 training data is about 3 6 h 6 7 h and 9 2 h with epoch 200 respectively the optimal oanw surrogate model is trained by the combination of training data is 2000 with the number of iterations is 200 to verify the prediction accuracy of the trained oanw surrogate model one testing set is randomly selected the results of predicted hydraulic head and contamination concentrations at different times are obtained using the surrogate model and the predicted field y is compared with the reference field y of the testing sample fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the oanw surrogate model can accurately predict the hydraulic head field and the contamination concentration field in each stress period with the exception of tiny deviations in several regions the overall absolute error is low 4 3 ilues inversion results in the ilues inversion framework considering the high dimensionality of the hydraulic conductivity field a parametric method is used to substitute the high dimensional parameter field with a low dimensional latent variable thereby identifying the high dimensional heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field at a lower computational cost on the other hand the inversion calculation of ilues still needs repetitive calls to the contaminant transport model therefore a surrogate model is introduced to further improve the calculation efficiency of ilues on the premise of ensuring the calculation accuracy the following is divided into two stages stage 1 is to introduce only the wgan gp generator into the inversion framework to analyze the performance of the gan ilues inversion framework combined with the wgan gp generator and stage 2 is to further integrate the oanw surrogate model on the basis of stage 1 thereby evaluating the performance of the gan oanw ilues inversion framework which incorporates the wgan gp generative model and the oanw surrogate model since the ensemble size ne has a significant impact on the inversion results of ilues a wide range of ne values from 200 to 600 are considered in the present study 4 3 1 inversion results based on gan ilues fig 10 shows the inversion results of the contamination source parameters in the first four stress periods s1 s4 based on the gan ilues framework with the original contaminant transport model as shown in fig 10 the sample uncertainty of the contaminant source parameters decreases gradually as the number of iterations increases and the sample means of the contamination source parameters approach the reference values the red line in fig 10 is the reference values the red curve family in fig 11 is the naee and rmse results of the estimated contaminant source parameters it can be clearly observed that after 3 ilues iterations the parameter estimation results tend to stabilize and the estimation errors are at a low level naee is less than 4 and rmse is less than 0 3 as a result when the number of iterations is greater than 3 the inversion results with ensemble sizes of 200 300 400 500 and 600 show little difference with regards to the contaminant source parameters and all can achieve satisfactory results in addition to the contaminant source parameters the inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field is more critical for the inversion of groundwater solute transport fig 12 shows the estimated results of hydraulic conductivity field after 5 iterations of gan ilues a is the reference hydraulic conductivity field b to d are the estimated mean hydraulic conductivity fields at the ne 400 500 and 600 respectively the ilues method based on wgan gp and the process based groundwater model can accurately estimate the high and low value regions of the hydraulic conductivity field as depicted in fig 12 fig 13 compares the variogram curves of the gan ilues estimation of the hydraulic conductivity field and the reference field along and y directions it is obvious that the three estimation results ne 400 500 and 600 are close to the statistical characteristics of the reference field compared with the reference values the naee values in the direction are 4 32 3 44 2 12 respectively and are 6 71 2 22 4 52 in the y direction considering that in groundwater problems the identification of the hydraulic conductivity field may be more significant than the influence of source strength on contaminant transport and x directions is the orientation of the covariance consequently the gan ilues inversion results with an ensemble size of 600 and an iteration number of 5 are used as the estimation results of contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity field the purpose of solving the groundwater inverse problem is to develop a groundwater model with strong predictive ability that is more representative of the actual situation it has been shown in figs 10 and 12 that the posterior estimation of contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields can be constructed using ilues method based on wgan gp and the process based groundwater model the estimated parameters could be utilized to calculate the predicted values of the hydraulic head and contaminant concentration at various times fig 14 presents the predicted fields hydraulic head and contaminant concentration corresponding to the real parameters and estimated parameters obtained from the gan ilues inversion the results demonstrate that the ilues inversion framework based on wgan gp and the process based groundwater model has a high level of prediction accuracy for contaminant concentration only a few areas display prediction errors and the overall prediction results are accurate for the hydraulic head field the maximum absolute error is less than 0 06 m all of these results indicate that the ilues inversion framework with the wgan gp parametric method is applicable and efficient for simultaneously identifying contaminant source parameters and a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field 4 3 2 inversion results based on gan oanw ilues the ilues inversion framework with the wgan gp parametric method can improve the efficiency of solving inverse problems while ensuring accuracy however the original contaminant transport model must still be repeatedly executed in the gan ilues framework resulting in a significant computing burden for example the case with an ensemble size of 600 and an iteration number of 5 requires 3600 600 5 600 calls to the process based groundwater model the oanw surrogate model is further integrated into the gan ilues inversion framework in this section and the results of model parameter inversion based on gan oanw ilues are discussed fig 15 shows the estimated results of contaminant source parameters acquired from the ilues inversion framework with oanw surrogate and wgan gp generator it can be observed from fig 15 that when the number of iterations increases the sample uncertainty of the contaminant source parameters decreases and the sample mean of the contamination source parameters approaches the reference values the red line in fig 15 is the reference values compared to fig 10 the degree of uncertainty reduction for contaminant source parameters from the gan oanw ilues is slightly lower than that from the gan ilues without oanw surrogate model the results show that even with a marginal reduction the inversion accuracy of the contaminant source parameters of the gan oanw ilues inversion model can be guaranteed the blue curve family in fig 11 represents the naee and rmse results of the estimated contaminant source parameters based on the gan oanw ilues inversion framework as the number of iterations increases the estimation error of contamination source parameters decreases and when the number of iterations reaches 5 the inversion result blue line curve family using the surrogate model is close to that of the process based groundwater model red line curve family moreover the estimation results get more accurate as the number of ensembles grows fig 16 illustrates the estimation results of the hydraulic conductivity field based on the gan oanw ilues framework a is the reference field b to d are the estimated mean hydraulic conductivity fields at the ne 400 500 and 600 respectively the naees of the estimated fields are 28 23 21 33 and 19 69 respectively however it is important to note that quantitative calculations such as naees should not be the main evaluation criteria for the results more attention should be paid to the accuracy of the characterization of high and low hydraulic conductivity regions as well as the variograms which can describe distribution characteristics in x and y direction as demonstrated in fig 16 when the ensemble size increases the ilues method with the oanw surrogate model and wgan gp generator can estimate the high and low value regions of the hydraulic conductivity field more precisely fig 17 compares the x and y direction variograms of the gan oanw ilues estimation results for the hydraulic conductivity field with the reference field the estimation results after 5 iterations are most similar to the statistical properties of the reference field when the ensemble number is 600 in consideration of the estimation accuracy of contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields the inverse mean value with 600 ensemble members and 5 iterations is selected as the final result for model parameter estimation the aforementioned studies have achieved the posterior estimation of contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields using the gan oanw ilues method fig 15 and fig 16 and the estimated parameters can be used to compute the predicted values of contaminant concentration and hydraulic head at different times fig 18 displays the predicted fields hydraulic head and contaminant concentration corresponding to the real parameters and the estimated parameters obtained from the gan oanw ilues inversion the results indicate that the gan oanw ilues inversion framework still has high prediction accuracy for contaminant concentration the area with significant errors has grown in comparison to the inversion results based on the gan ilues framework but the overall distribution pattern of the contaminant plume is close to the reference field for the hydraulic head field the maximum absolute error is approximately 0 07 m which is not significantly different from the inversion results based on the gan ilues framework the results of model parameter inversion and prediction demonstrate that the ilues inversion framework with wgan gp and oanw performs well for model parameter inversion the inversion results of the model parameters with and without the oanw surrogate model are detailed above and both inversion frameworks are capable of reliably estimating the model parameters by quantitative and qualitative analysis to illustrate the improvement in inversion speed resulting from the oanw surrogate model the computational time required by each of the two methods is presented below when the inversion of groundwater model parameters is performed based on gan ilues the main computational load of the forward calculation of the original numerical groundwater model as well as the call calculation of the process based groundwater model during ilues data assimilation also significantly increases the burden on computational resources the relationship between the inversion computation time t the number of ensembles n e and the number of iterations n i is as follows 15 t n e t f n i where t f is the time for a single forward model run with the oanw surrogate model the process based groundwater model is no longer executed during the inversion process resulting in a significant reduction in inversion computation time table 2 lists the amount of time required to complete 5 iterations of gan ilues and gan oanw ilues for different ensemble numbers n e despite the fact that the parameter estimation results get increasingly precise as the ensemble size increases the time consumed for iterative calculation increases remarkably after adopting the oanw surrogate model there is no significant change in the results of parameter inversion while the time required for the data assimilation process is reduced by more than 92 indicating a considerable improvement in computational efficiency 5 conclusions and future directions in this study we propose a novel and efficient approach for estimating groundwater contaminant source and hydraulic conductivity by combining two deep learning frameworks namely wgan gp and oanw into the ilues data assimilation model in the combined framework wgan gp is used to construct a generator model that converts high dimensional aquifer properties into low dimensional vectors through an image processing strategy by using a trained generator an aquifer structure conforming to specific statistical characteristics can be quickly constructed which significantly enhances the efficiency of inversion calculations furthermore oanw is employed as an effective surrogate for the original numerical groundwater model a key feature of oanw is the used of double layer weights around the contaminant source locations which captures the strong nonlinearity and complexity of the concentration field near the contaminant source the performance of the hybrid framework that combines wgan gp and oanw with ilues is demonstrated using a synthetic gaussian aquifer wgan gp reduced the dimensionality of the hydraulic conductivity field from 2665 to 200 significantly reducing the time required for site characterization and minimizing the parameters to be inverted during data assimilation process oanw demonstrates efficient predictions of hydraulic head and contaminant concentration field over 8 stress periods with high accuracy moreover the use of oanw instead of process based numerical models avoided the high computational cost associated with traditional data assimilation methods by combining wgan gp and oanw the entire inversion framework gan oanw ilues reduced the simulation time by 92 compared to running the full numerical groundwater model without surrogate model gan ilues while maintaining a similar level of accuracy note that since the inversion framework incorporates two deep learning models the errors in the calculation process may have a cumulative effect necessitating higher accuracy requirements for each model to ensure the accuracy even if the accuracy of the model seems to be guaranteed the generalization ability still needs to be strengthened and the next step should be to enhance the diversity of the model rather than limiting it to site specific designed for a specific site applications moreover future research should consider more complex field conditions such as channelized and multi facies fields and three dimensional domains to further investigate the applicability of these methods under practical scenarios credit authorship contribution statement na zheng

1917,in the inverse estimation of groundwater model parameters e g contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields data assimilation is the most commonly used method for solving the inverse problem however data assimilation requires iterative calculation which tends to increase the computational costs this is particularly problematic when dealing with high dimensional problems in this study we propose a hybrid inversion framework which combines a generative adversarial network gan and a convolutional neural network cnn for groundwater model parameter estimation the gan is equipped with gradient penalties wgan gp to achieve fast characterization of high dimensional aquifer structures with low dimensional vectors 200 dimensions meanwhile this study proposes an enhanced

oanw ilues the inversion framework containing the wgan gp generative model and the oanw surrogate model 1 introduction in research related to groundwater contamination management it is advantageous to clarify the release history of the contamination source and hydraulic conductivity of the contaminated site to identify the location and duration of contamination however this information is often difficult to obtain directly and usually requires inversion calculation from observation data this is a typical groundwater inverse problem for inverse problems the results are significantly dependent on the accurate description of the hydraulic conductivity field in addition the prediction of the contamination plume in the subsequent contamination treatment is substantially influenced by the accuracy of the hydraulic conductivity field characterization geostatistical modeling methods are typically employed to characterize the hydraulic conductivity field which infer the heterogeneity of the entire site from a small amount of measurement data hard data and a priori spatial statistical information in the site zheng et al 2020 however geostatistical modeling methods such as sgsim deutsch and journel 1998 have two main limitations first direct measurements are usually sparse when the sites are highly heterogeneous there is a large uncertainty in the area without measurement data making it difficult to obtain satisfactory results jiang et al 2022 second geostatistical methods require a significant amount of computational resources when performing detailed site characterization based on priori statistical information for example the time complexity of the method reaches o n 3 when estimating n points cormen et al 2009 indicating that the computational cost increases considerably with the number of points to be estimated which is undesirable for large scale applications in order to address the issue that very few observations of hydraulic conductivity affect the overall characteristics of the contaminated site data assimilation methods calculate the inverse of the hydraulic conductivity field using indirect observations e g hydraulic head and contaminant concentration data the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and its variants ensemble smoother es li et al 2018 and iterative ensemble smoother ies chen and oliver 2012 are widely used in hydrogeological research kang et al 2021 li et al 2012 schöniger et al 2012 based on ies zhang et al 2018 proposed an iterative local updating ensemble smoother ilues the ilues method improves the computational efficiency of inverting high dimensional system by utilizing a local update strategy of the sampled ensemble to update the parameters numerous research results demonstrate that ilues can significantly reduce the uncertainty of model parameter estimation yang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 many researchers have conducted studies to enhance the computational efficiency of geostatistical methods for characterizing aquifers such as reducing the computational complexity by mathematically transforming the form tzeng and huang 2018 only considering the points around the

coupled physical conditions with deep learning and proposed the piml framework that can significantly reduce the computational time of sgsim bai and tahmasebi 2022 jardani et al 2022 designed the algorithm called cnn ht to predict the inverse operator of hydraulic tomography using a synthetic training dataset which include the hydraulic head data associated with pumping tests zhou and tartakovsky 2021 proposed a markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach that uses samples from a cnn surrogate of a pde based model which was used to reconstruct contaminant release history from sparse and noisy measurements of solute concentration liu and durlofsky 2021 combined convolutional neural network cnn and principal component analysis pca to effectively characterize high dimensional complex aquifer features in addition generative adversarial networks gan are increasingly used for aquifer structure characterization azevedo et al 2020 chan and elsheikh 2020 mosser et al 2017 dupont et al 2018 used gan to construct a model that follows a physical measurement mechanism which can rapidly and efficiently characterize complex geological models laloy et al 2018 used the spatial generative adversarial neural network sgan to characterize two dimensional channelized aquifers and combined it with markov chain monte carlo mcmc to characterize aquifer structure zhan et al 2022 used a geological single sample generative adversarial network geosingan to characterize the heterogeneous structure of the aquifer and then combined it with ilues for characterizing aquifer structure in the aforementioned studies gans are mainly employed to characterize the heterogeneous structure of complicated aquifers serving as stochastic simulators for such aquifers a few studies have integrated gan into groundwater inversion problems for identifying hydraulic conductivity chan and elsheikh 2019 razak and jafarpour 2022 proposed two approaches to generate non gaussian patterns with conditioning generative adversarial network cgan pan et al 2022 utilized a deep convolutional cycle generative adversarial neural network dc cgan to directly estimate the hydraulic conductivity field and compared with the indirect approaches sun et al 2023 employed gan to reproduce the complex meandering multi facies distributions however to the best of our knowledge there has been no studies thus far that combines gan to estimate aquifer parameters and other model parameters simultaneously e g contaminant source information using data assimilation for high dimensional inverse simulation requires repeated executions of the groundwater model by constructing a surrogate model of the numerical groundwater model it is possible to further improve the computational efficiency zhang et al 2016 among popular surrogate models the deep neural networks dnns have gained the attention of many researchers through reasonable design of the hidden layers of dnns surrogate models could provide accurate alternative representations of complex process based models may be obtained for example mo et al 2019a transformed the task into an image to image regression problem and constructed a surrogate model with a dense convolutional network densenet structure which was applied to the multiphase flow simulation of co2 geological storage tang et al 2021 2020 developed a surrogate model based on deep convolutional and recurrent neural network rnn structure and applied it to predict dynamic subsurface flow in a channelized geological model in our study a generative model is employed to characterize the aquifer structure to achieve simultaneous inversion of hydraulic conductivity field and contaminant source parameters to rapidly and accurately characterize high dimensional aquifer structure with low dimensional inputs a novel inversion framework is proposed which employs wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty wgan gp in addition we extend the ar net wl surrogate model mo et al 2019b by incorporating dual weight layers at the outer edge of the contaminant source the proposed model named oanw optimized ar net wl can effectively capture the strong nonlinearity and complexity of the concentration field near the contaminant source finally by integrating wgan gp and oanw into the ilues inversion framework the resulting framework is capable of executing fast and effective model parameter estimation using a limited amount of observation data hydraulic head and contaminant concentration data 2 methods in this section the groundwater contamination transport model is first introduced in section 2 1 followed by the integrated ilues inversion framework in addition to the ilues method module in section 2 2 the inversion framework in section 2 5 also includes two important components in section 2 3 and 2 4 a gan wgan gp for generating complex hydraulic conductivity field and a novel surrogate model optimized ar net wl oanw for groundwater contaminant transport model 2 1 groundwater contaminant transport model this study considers contaminant transport under steady state groundwater flow conditions assuming that advection and dispersion are the dominant transport processes notably the reaction term is not considered in this study the governing equation of steady state groundwater flow is as follows harbaugh et al 2000 1 k h 0 2 v k θ h where k lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head θ is the porosity of the aquifer medium and v lt 1 is the pore space flow velocity the groundwater solute transport equation is as follows zheng and wang 1999 3 θ c t θ d c θ v c q s c s where c ml 3 is the concentration of contaminant d l2t 1 is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion tensor v lt 1 is the velocity in the aquifer medium q s t 1 is the flow rate of the source sink term per unit volume of the aquifer and c s ml 3 is the concentration of source sink term 2 2 ilues method zhang et al 2018 in this study ilues is adopted as the inversion method for groundwater inverse problems a brief description of the ilues method is provided herein for simplicity the relationship between uncertain model parameters e g hydraulic conductivities contaminant source information and measurements e g observed hydraulic head and contaminant concentration can be expressed in the following form 4 d f m ε where d is a vector of measurements m is a vector of uncertain model parameters f m denotes the forward model with uncertain parameters m and ε is a vector of measurement errors ilues introduces a local updating scheme in contrast to the ensemble smoother es to better deal with high dimensional and strongly nonlinear problems and assimilates the available observation data for multiple times ilues initially updates the local set j m of ne samples for the uncertain groundwater model parameters m 5 j m j 1 m j 1 max j 2 m j 2 max where j 1 m f m d t c d 1 f m d is the distance between model predictions f m and observations d j 2 m m m j f t c mm 1 m m j f is the distance between model parameter m and the corresponding samples m j f c d is the covariance matrix of observation errors and c mm is the autocovariance matrix of model parameters j 1 max and j 2 max are the maximum values of j 1 m and j 2 m respectively ilues then selects the n smallest j m values and the corresponding sample parameter m j f is defined as the local sample m j l f of the parameter this parameter is updated according to the following formula 6 m j i a m j i f c md l f c dd l f c d 1 d j f m j i f where c md l f is the cross covariance matrix of m j l f m j 1 f m j 2 f m j n l f and d j l f g m j 1 f g m j 2 f g m j n l f c dd l f is the autocovariance matrix of d j l f and d j d ε is the observed true value d after introducing errors ε as the update result for parameter m j f a random sample value is selected after each update of the local samples the above update process is applied to n e sets of parameter samples and the overall update result m a m 1 l a m 2 l a m n e l a of parameter m is finally obtained a more detailed explanation of iterative local updating ensemble smoother ilues can be found in zhang s research zhang et al 2018 2 3 wgan gp in this study wgan gp is adopted to generate complex hydraulic conductivity fields for groundwater inverse problems a brief description of the wgan gp architecture is provided as follows generative adversarial network gan is proposed by goodfellow et al 2014 using two neural networks generator g and discriminator d for adversarial training in terms of hydrogeology trained generators can quickly characterize aquifer parameters the generator accepts a low dimensional vector z as input and attempts to generate the output g z that matches the features of the training data the discriminator takes g z and training data as input and analyzes the error between them then it gives a score as the output the greater the score the closer the g z matches the target distribution both continuously minimize the following loss functions during the training process goodfellow et al 2014 7 min g max d v d g e x p data x l o g d x e z p z z log 1 d g z where p data x denotes the training data and p z z denotes the low dimensional input satisfying a specific distribution often uniform or gaussian in the process of training the generator frequently encounters the problem of gradient disappearance which prevents the model from changing to a better direction in addition the generator is susceptible to mode collapse problem when the discriminator of the original gan reaches near optimality gulrajani et al 2017 to address the aforementioned issues arjovsky et al 2017 proposed wasserstein gan wgan by enhancing the original gan with the wasserstein distance the wasserstein distance function of wgan gp is as follows 8 w p data x p z z sup d l 1 e x p data x d x e z p z z d z however since wgan adopts a weight clipping strategy to enforce the lipschitz constraint on d the weights in d tend to be close to the clipping bound to enable d to learn a more uniform weight distribution gulrajani et al 2017 added gradient penalty to wgan thereby proposing a generative adversarial network wgan gp the loss function in wgan gp is as follows 9 l e x p data x d x e z p z z d g z λ e x p x x d x 2 1 2 where x d x represents the gradient of d and λ represents the gradient constraint weight in this study wgan gp is adopted to construct a generative model of aquifer structure fig 1 the vector z 200 dimensions in the latter case with gaussian distribution is used as the input of g the hydraulic conductivity field training set obtained by sequential gaussian simulation sgs nussbaumer et al 2018 and the hydraulic conductivity field g z generated by g are both taken as the input of d after training the generator could quickly generate hydraulic conductivity field realizations that may approximate the actual model 2 4 oanw surrogate model cnn based models usually adopt an image to image framework to establish a complex nonlinear relationship between the input and the output images as shown in fig 2 the former contains hydraulic conductivity field k and contaminant source strength si and the latter consists of hydraulic head h and contaminant concentration field ci this cnn based surrogate model is described as 10 input k s i n t o u t p u t h c i n t where i 1 2 3 n t and n t is the number of stress periods in this study a novel surrogate model optimized ar net wl oanw was proposed for the groundwater contaminant transport model the optimized ar net wl oanw is an improved network structure based on mo s ar net wl mo et al 2019a which is composed of densenet a brief description is as follows densenet is used to construct a surrogate model for the groundwater contaminant transport model consisting of dense block and transition layer in contrast to the connection method of conventional neural networks dense block connects not only adjacent but also non adjacent network layers this connection method can effectively reduce the information loss caused by the network information transmission process which is expressed as encblock and decblock in the encoder and decoder respectively in fig 2 the connection mode of dense blocks however causes an explosion in the number of feature maps of network output as the number of network layers increases to solve this problem transition layers are used to connect dense blocks to reduce the number and dimensions of feature maps the concentration field usually exhibits large gradients in regions near the source of the contaminant which frequently results in large approximation errors liao et al 2017 since the deep convolutional neural network is an image based machine learning classification model processing images with local nonlinear features is challenging it brings difficulty for the surrogate model to produce accurate results especially in the case of inadequate training data similar to mo s research in order to improve the accuracy of the network surrogate model in the vicinity of the contaminant source a network structure optimized ar net wl oanw is proposed to optimize the weight loss function the specific improvement is illustrated in fig 3 during the stress period of contaminant release the source grid and its surrounding 8 grids serve as the first weight layer while the 16 grids next to the first weight layer are designated as the second weight layer the losses of the first and second weight layers are calculated to obtain ζ1 and ζ2 and the loss functions are derived by assigning the extra weights w1 and w2 to the first and second weight layers respectively the optimized l 1 loss function can be expressed as follows 11 l wl θ l θ l w 1 θ l w 2 θ 12 l wi w i i 1 n t c si c si i 1 2 where l θ is the original l1 loss function c si is the original contaminant concentration field c si is the model prediction of c si and w i denotes the weight with w1 8 and w2 4 in this case the discussion of weights can be found in mo s research mo et al 2019a 2 5 ilues inversion framework the general framework of the ilues data assimilation method incorporating the wgan gp generative model and the oanw surrogate model hereafter referred to as the surrogate model is shown in fig 4 and the main steps are as follows 1 training the generator g and the surrogate model based on training data respectively 2 randomly generate ne group z that conforms to the gaussian distribution then sample from the prior distribution to obtain the ne group contamination source parameters si 3 input z into g to obtain the estimated field of hydraulic conductivity field k field in fig 4 and use g z and si as inputs to the substitution model to obtain the simulated observations of the ne group samples 4 using ilues update ne group z and si by simulated observations and observed reference values 5 repeat steps 3 and 4 for the updated z and si until the predetermined number of iterations has been reached 3 case study 3 1 problem description as depicted in fig 5 a two dimensional steady state groundwater flow through an isotropic heterogeneous confined aquifer is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed inversion framework provided in section 2 the confined aquifer 32 m 20 m is divided into 65 by 41 square grids cells with a cell size of 0 5 m the top and bottom boundaries are no flux the west and east boundaries are enforced with constant hydraulic heads of 11 m and 10 m respectively the hydraulic conductivity field is assumed to satisfy a log normal distribution with prescribed mean lnk 3 0 and variance σ l n k 2 1 0 the correlation lengths in the and y directions are 9 6 m and 6 0 m respectively the variogram type is exponential the contaminant source in fig 5 with time varying strength is considered in this case and the contaminant is released during each stress period the duration of the entire simulation is 40 days which is divided into an average of 8 stress periods the contaminant source strength parameters including prior information and reference values are listed in table 1 the porosity of the aquifer is 0 30 the longitudinal dispersivity is 2 0 m and the transverse dispersivity is 0 6 m in this case the parameters to be estimated are the hydraulic conductivity field and contaminant source strength note that the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field has a dimension of 2665 65 41 based on the degree of grid subdivision at the site however with the use of wgan gp to reduce the dimensionality of the hydraulic conductivity field only a low dimensional input 200 dimensional is required for inversion to estimate these uncertain model parameters 15 observation wells are arranged at the contaminated site the hydraulic head and contaminant concentration at the end of each stress period are collected as observation data yielding a total of 135 15 15 8 135 data points 3 2 assessment criteria to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the surrogate model and parameter inversion results root mean square error rmse and normalized absolute error of estimation naee are introduced 13 rmse 1 n e i 1 n e y i y i 2 14 naee i 1 n k q k e q k a i 1 n k q k a 100 where n e denotes the total number of test samples y i represents the process based groundwater model output of the sample and y i represents the surrogate model prediction result of the sample q k a represents the reference value of source strength in the kth stress period q k e represents the estimated source strength in the kth stress period the smaller rmse is the higher the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model the smaller naee is the closer the parameter inversion approaches the reference value 4 results and discussion in the modified ilues inversion framework the wgan gp generator for the hydraulic conductivity field and the oanw surrogate model for the contaminant transport model are trained separately before applying ilues method to simultaneously estimate these uncertain model parameters the hydraulic conductivity field and contaminant source strength in this section we first evaluate the validity of the trained generator and surrogate model to assess the model results and then analyze the inversion results by discussing the ensemble number ne 4 1 performance of wgan gp generator in this study the low dimensional input satisfying the gaussian distribution n 0 1 can be transformed into the output that matches the characteristics of the training data hydraulic conductivity field by using the trained wgan gp generator the optimal generator is determined by comparing the effects of different hyperparameters the hyperparameters of the discriminator and generator are 4 315 200 and 4317824 respectively of gans on model results the activity function for each layer in wgan gp is leaky relu for the generator and relu for the discriminator the size of training data is 30000 and the batch size is 64 the optimizer is adam learning rate is 0 0001 for generator and 0 0002 for discriminator the wgan gp and oanw models used in this work are developed under the pytorch framework training is performed on an nvidia geforce gtx 1660 ti gpu the statistical distribution of 50 randomly selected realizations from the generator is shown in fig 6 as can be observed the statistical distribution of mean and variance for the generated results strongly agrees with the training set in terms of generation time the trained generator takes only 0 237 s to generate 50 sets of hydraulic conductivity fields with prescribed statistical characteristics fig 7 shows the variograms of the 50 randomly selected hydraulic conductivity fields generated with the sgs simulator the results indicate that the wgan gp generator efficiently captures the variogram features of the training data combining fig 6 and fig 7 the trained generator can effectively characterize the structural features of heterogeneous aquifers 4 2 performance of oanw surrogate model in this study oanw a modified ar net wl is proposed to construct a surrogate model for contaminant transport model the activity function for each layer is relu and the training data batch size is 16 the optimizer is adam learning rate is 0 0002 in addition to network structure the size of training data and number of iterations have a significant impact on the performance of the oanw surrogate model three different sizes of training data 1000 2000 and 3000 are considered the testing dataset consists of 500 randomly generated testing samples in this study the training data and test data for the oanw surrogate model are obtained from two existing numerical models modflow for simulating groundwater flow and mt3dms for simulating mass transport inputs to these models include the hydraulic conductivity field and the contaminant source strength the former is generated by wgan gp whereas the latter is randomly sampled within a predefined range in table 1 the outputs of the modflow mt3dms model are the spatial temporal field of hydraulic head and contaminant concentration this study does not use separate validation data but instead the optimal oanw surrogate model which performed the best on the test dataset is used for the inversion of reference values to evaluate its performance in numerical cases fig 8 depicts the estimation accuracy rmse of the surrogate model as the size of training data and the number of iterations epoch increases when the number of iterations is 200 as shown in fig 8 the surrogate model converges and performs stably on the training data for the testing set the error of the surrogate model severely fluctuates with 1000 training samples although the overall rmse remains less than 0 20 when the size of the training data is 2000 or 3000 the training error of the surrogate model is small and there is no significant difference between the two training error values taking into account the training time the training time of 1000 2000 and 3000 training data is about 3 6 h 6 7 h and 9 2 h with epoch 200 respectively the optimal oanw surrogate model is trained by the combination of training data is 2000 with the number of iterations is 200 to verify the prediction accuracy of the trained oanw surrogate model one testing set is randomly selected the results of predicted hydraulic head and contamination concentrations at different times are obtained using the surrogate model and the predicted field y is compared with the reference field y of the testing sample fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the oanw surrogate model can accurately predict the hydraulic head field and the contamination concentration field in each stress period with the exception of tiny deviations in several regions the overall absolute error is low 4 3 ilues inversion results in the ilues inversion framework considering the high dimensionality of the hydraulic conductivity field a parametric method is used to substitute the high dimensional parameter field with a low dimensional latent variable thereby identifying the high dimensional heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field at a lower computational cost on the other hand the inversion calculation of ilues still needs repetitive calls to the contaminant transport model therefore a surrogate model is introduced to further improve the calculation efficiency of ilues on the premise of ensuring the calculation accuracy the following is divided into two stages stage 1 is to introduce only the wgan gp generator into the inversion framework to analyze the performance of the gan ilues inversion framework combined with the wgan gp generator and stage 2 is to further integrate the oanw surrogate model on the basis of stage 1 thereby evaluating the performance of the gan oanw ilues inversion framework which incorporates the wgan gp generative model and the oanw surrogate model since the ensemble size ne has a significant impact on the inversion results of ilues a wide range of ne values from 200 to 600 are considered in the present study 4 3 1 inversion results based on gan ilues fig 10 shows the inversion results of the contamination source parameters in the first four stress periods s1 s4 based on the gan ilues framework with the original contaminant transport model as shown in fig 10 the sample uncertainty of the contaminant source parameters decreases gradually as the number of iterations increases and the sample means of the contamination source parameters approach the reference values the red line in fig 10 is the reference values the red curve family in fig 11 is the naee and rmse results of the estimated contaminant source parameters it can be clearly observed that after 3 ilues iterations the parameter estimation results tend to stabilize and the estimation errors are at a low level naee is less than 4 and rmse is less than 0 3 as a result when the number of iterations is greater than 3 the inversion results with ensemble sizes of 200 300 400 500 and 600 show little difference with regards to the contaminant source parameters and all can achieve satisfactory results in addition to the contaminant source parameters the inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field is more critical for the inversion of groundwater solute transport fig 12 shows the estimated results of hydraulic conductivity field after 5 iterations of gan ilues a is the reference hydraulic conductivity field b to d are the estimated mean hydraulic conductivity fields at the ne 400 500 and 600 respectively the ilues method based on wgan gp and the process based groundwater model can accurately estimate the high and low value regions of the hydraulic conductivity field as depicted in fig 12 fig 13 compares the variogram curves of the gan ilues estimation of the hydraulic conductivity field and the reference field along and y directions it is obvious that the three estimation results ne 400 500 and 600 are close to the statistical characteristics of the reference field compared with the reference values the naee values in the direction are 4 32 3 44 2 12 respectively and are 6 71 2 22 4 52 in the y direction considering that in groundwater problems the identification of the hydraulic conductivity field may be more significant than the influence of source strength on contaminant transport and x directions is the orientation of the covariance consequently the gan ilues inversion results with an ensemble size of 600 and an iteration number of 5 are used as the estimation results of contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity field the purpose of solving the groundwater inverse problem is to develop a groundwater model with strong predictive ability that is more representative of the actual situation it has been shown in figs 10 and 12 that the posterior estimation of contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields can be constructed using ilues method based on wgan gp and the process based groundwater model the estimated parameters could be utilized to calculate the predicted values of the hydraulic head and contaminant concentration at various times fig 14 presents the predicted fields hydraulic head and contaminant concentration corresponding to the real parameters and estimated parameters obtained from the gan ilues inversion the results demonstrate that the ilues inversion framework based on wgan gp and the process based groundwater model has a high level of prediction accuracy for contaminant concentration only a few areas display prediction errors and the overall prediction results are accurate for the hydraulic head field the maximum absolute error is less than 0 06 m all of these results indicate that the ilues inversion framework with the wgan gp parametric method is applicable and efficient for simultaneously identifying contaminant source parameters and a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field 4 3 2 inversion results based on gan oanw ilues the ilues inversion framework with the wgan gp parametric method can improve the efficiency of solving inverse problems while ensuring accuracy however the original contaminant transport model must still be repeatedly executed in the gan ilues framework resulting in a significant computing burden for example the case with an ensemble size of 600 and an iteration number of 5 requires 3600 600 5 600 calls to the process based groundwater model the oanw surrogate model is further integrated into the gan ilues inversion framework in this section and the results of model parameter inversion based on gan oanw ilues are discussed fig 15 shows the estimated results of contaminant source parameters acquired from the ilues inversion framework with oanw surrogate and wgan gp generator it can be observed from fig 15 that when the number of iterations increases the sample uncertainty of the contaminant source parameters decreases and the sample mean of the contamination source parameters approaches the reference values the red line in fig 15 is the reference values compared to fig 10 the degree of uncertainty reduction for contaminant source parameters from the gan oanw ilues is slightly lower than that from the gan ilues without oanw surrogate model the results show that even with a marginal reduction the inversion accuracy of the contaminant source parameters of the gan oanw ilues inversion model can be guaranteed the blue curve family in fig 11 represents the naee and rmse results of the estimated contaminant source parameters based on the gan oanw ilues inversion framework as the number of iterations increases the estimation error of contamination source parameters decreases and when the number of iterations reaches 5 the inversion result blue line curve family using the surrogate model is close to that of the process based groundwater model red line curve family moreover the estimation results get more accurate as the number of ensembles grows fig 16 illustrates the estimation results of the hydraulic conductivity field based on the gan oanw ilues framework a is the reference field b to d are the estimated mean hydraulic conductivity fields at the ne 400 500 and 600 respectively the naees of the estimated fields are 28 23 21 33 and 19 69 respectively however it is important to note that quantitative calculations such as naees should not be the main evaluation criteria for the results more attention should be paid to the accuracy of the characterization of high and low hydraulic conductivity regions as well as the variograms which can describe distribution characteristics in x and y direction as demonstrated in fig 16 when the ensemble size increases the ilues method with the oanw surrogate model and wgan gp generator can estimate the high and low value regions of the hydraulic conductivity field more precisely fig 17 compares the x and y direction variograms of the gan oanw ilues estimation results for the hydraulic conductivity field with the reference field the estimation results after 5 iterations are most similar to the statistical properties of the reference field when the ensemble number is 600 in consideration of the estimation accuracy of contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields the inverse mean value with 600 ensemble members and 5 iterations is selected as the final result for model parameter estimation the aforementioned studies have achieved the posterior estimation of contaminant source parameters and hydraulic conductivity fields using the gan oanw ilues method fig 15 and fig 16 and the estimated parameters can be used to compute the predicted values of contaminant concentration and hydraulic head at different times fig 18 displays the predicted fields hydraulic head and contaminant concentration corresponding to the real parameters and the estimated parameters obtained from the gan oanw ilues inversion the results indicate that the gan oanw ilues inversion framework still has high prediction accuracy for contaminant concentration the area with significant errors has grown in comparison to the inversion results based on the gan ilues framework but the overall distribution pattern of the contaminant plume is close to the reference field for the hydraulic head field the maximum absolute error is approximately 0 07 m which is not significantly different from the inversion results based on the gan ilues framework the results of model parameter inversion and prediction demonstrate that the ilues inversion framework with wgan gp and oanw performs well for model parameter inversion the inversion results of the model parameters with and without the oanw surrogate model are detailed above and both inversion frameworks are capable of reliably estimating the model parameters by quantitative and qualitative analysis to illustrate the improvement in inversion speed resulting from the oanw surrogate model the computational time required by each of the two methods is presented below when the inversion of groundwater model parameters is performed based on gan ilues the main computational load of the forward calculation of the original numerical groundwater model as well as the call calculation of the process based groundwater model during ilues data assimilation also significantly increases the burden on computational resources the relationship between the inversion computation time t the number of ensembles n e and the number of iterations n i is as follows 15 t n e t f n i where t f is the time for a single forward model run with the oanw surrogate model the process based groundwater model is no longer executed during the inversion process resulting in a significant reduction in inversion computation time table 2 lists the amount of time required to complete 5 iterations of gan ilues and gan oanw ilues for different ensemble numbers n e despite the fact that the parameter estimation results get increasingly precise as the ensemble size increases the time consumed for iterative calculation increases remarkably after adopting the oanw surrogate model there is no significant change in the results of parameter inversion while the time required for the data assimilation process is reduced by more than 92 indicating a considerable improvement in computational efficiency 5 conclusions and future directions in this study we propose a novel and efficient approach for estimating groundwater contaminant source and hydraulic conductivity by combining two deep learning frameworks namely wgan gp and oanw into the ilues data assimilation model in the combined framework wgan gp is used to construct a generator model that converts high dimensional aquifer properties into low dimensional vectors through an image processing strategy by using a trained generator an aquifer structure conforming to specific statistical characteristics can be quickly constructed which significantly enhances the efficiency of inversion calculations furthermore oanw is employed as an effective surrogate for the original numerical groundwater model a key feature of oanw is the used of double layer weights around the contaminant source locations which captures the strong nonlinearity and complexity of the concentration field near the contaminant source the performance of the hybrid framework that combines wgan gp and oanw with ilues is demonstrated using a synthetic gaussian aquifer wgan gp reduced the dimensionality of the hydraulic conductivity field from 2665 to 200 significantly reducing the time required for site characterization and minimizing the parameters to be inverted during data assimilation process oanw demonstrates efficient predictions of hydraulic head and contaminant concentration field over 8 stress periods with high accuracy moreover the use of oanw instead of process based numerical models avoided the high computational cost associated with traditional data assimilation methods by combining wgan gp and oanw the entire inversion framework gan oanw ilues reduced the simulation time by 92 compared to running the full numerical groundwater model without surrogate model gan ilues while maintaining a similar level of accuracy note that since the inversion framework incorporates two deep learning models the errors in the calculation process may have a cumulative effect necessitating higher accuracy requirements for each model to ensure the accuracy even if the accuracy of the model seems to be guaranteed the generalization ability still needs to be strengthened and the next step should be to enhance the diversity of the model rather than limiting it to site specific designed for a specific site applications moreover future research should consider more complex field conditions such as channelized and multi facies fields and three dimensional domains to further investigate the applicability of these methods under practical scenarios credit authorship contribution statement na zheng

1918,the complex groundwater solute transport model can generally be divided into several coupled submodels the systematic error is inevitable in each submodel due to the unreasonable simplification or biased representation of the true groundwater environment system the submodels systematic errors and their propagation lead to great challenge for reliable model predictions to improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model the stacked gaussian processes regression gpr method was proposed to quantify and reduce the error propagation among the submodels in this study stacked gpr corrects the structure errors of groundwater model submodel by submodel gradually two case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of stacked gpr method including a synthetical groundwater transport case and a laboratory nacl solute transport experiment the results demonstrated that stacked gpr can reduce the error propagation among submodels and improve model s predictive performance apparently moreover it is more feasible to correct the structure error of each submodel in sequence by stacked gpr than to correct the lumped structure error by traditional gpr for a component based groundwater solute transport model the errors in prior submodels could aggravate the complexity of the error of the posterior submodel though error propagation which increases the difficulty of constructing an effective error correcting model keywords stacked gaussian processes regression model structure error systematic error groundwater solute transport model prediction data availability the research data can be found in the attached datafile 1 introduction numerical models are widely used to deal with various groundwater issues such as groundwater contamination remediation and risk assessment and water resource management adombi et al 2022 enemark et al 2019 due to the complexity of groundwater environment and the lack of hydrogeological information the numerical models are often established with unreasonable model parameters and structure that lead to random and systematic model errors köpke et al 2019 markovich et al 2022 reed and kollat 2012 e g the descriptions of aquifer s structure and chemical reaction kinetics hence the produced model predictions would contain systematic error to reduce the systematic model prediction error which caused by neglecting the important elements of actual physical processes recently some researchers have proposed the data driven method ddm to improve the prediction of groundwater models kasiviswanathan et al 2019 marker et al 2017 pathiraja et al 2018 pianosi and raso 2012 ddm uses an error correcting complementary model to represent the systematic model error and this error correcting model is built statistically through the model input and output data consequently the model outputs or predictions in ddm are represented by the sum of the physical model the error correcting model and the observation error model recently gaussian processes regression gpr is one of commonly used method to build the error correcting model in ddms rasmussen and williams 2006 zhang et al 2019 for example pan et al 2021 applied gpr method to handle the systematic groundwater model error caused by complex aquifer structure and unknown kinetic processes they found that gpr can improve groundwater model predictions e g the root mean square error rmse reduced by 65 97 xu et al 2017 built an error correcting model to improve a real world regional scale groundwater model s head prediction via gpr method they concluded that the systematic model error can dramatically affect model s predictive performance and gpr reduced the predictions mean absolute error mae by 76 78 thus the gpr based ddm shows good potential for correcting the systematic model error and improving the predictive performance in groundwater modeling usually the systematic model error addressed in ddm represents the lumped error from all elements of the groundwater model demissie et al 2009 e g the settings of hydraulic conductivity field and boundary conditions and it is difficult to build a perfect complementary model to correct this complex lumped error moreover the error propagation and composition in groundwater modeling are not clearly addressed in the current researches of ddm according to the key processes of model conceptualization performing error correction for each key process respectively rather than correcting the lumped error this would potentially help further correct the systematic model error and improve model s predictive performance in addition quantifying the error propagation process in groundwater modeling can provide insights into the error generation and revealing important error sources generally a complex groundwater model is constructed by several logically related components for example a groundwater solute transport model can be usually divided into three coupled components that i the description of model medium s properties e g the hydraulic conductivity field ii the groundwater flow model and iii the advection dispersion model hence the groundwater model is modularized and hierarchical and it can be regarded as component based model moreover for the component based models the output of the former component is the input of the latter one such as the hydraulic conductivity field is the input of flow model the groundwater head is input of advection dispersion model for each component hereinafter referred to as submodel the unreasonable conceptualization could lead to systematic error that will transfer to posterior submodel through model inputs thus the model outputs or predictions generated by the last submodel are influenced by the systematic errors from all previous submodels hence for the component based model quantifying the propagation of systematic errors in the submodels is of great significance for improving model prediction abdelfatah 2019 li et al 2015 recently some researchers investigated the propagation of errors in groundwater surface water modeling e g mishra 2000 applied point estimated method to investigate the error propagation from model inputs e g pore volume and exponential decline rate to the risk of radioactive contaminants in a reservoir to human health lewis 2016 analyzed the propagation of errors from different sources of observations e g groundwater pumping water level in predicting the dynamic response of soil carbon to wetland restorations however these researches focused on the propagation of errors from different sources of observations or inputs instead of the quantification of systematic model error through the model components abdelfatah et al 2016 proposed a stacked gpr method to quantify the propagation of systematic error in an aflatoxin production model that was divided into three submodels temperature model water activity model and daily aflatoxin model stacked gpr method describes the systematic model error caused by the lack information of daily temperature distribution the unknown water content series of corn and the influence of temperature and water activity on aflatoxin production via three gprs respectively and the results demonstrated that stacked gpr can effectively handle the propagation of systematic error among submodels and improve model s prediction performance stacked gpr corrects the structure errors of groundwater model submodel by submodel gradually which provides an excellent way to quantify the propagation of systematic error for the component based groundwater contaminant transport models and improving the predictions moreover to the best of our knowledge there are currently no studies focused on quantifying systematic error propagation sequentially between submodels in groundwater models in this paper we apply the stacked gpr to improve the predictions of groundwater models by quantifying the propagation of systemic error two groundwater model cases are used in this study a synthetical three dimensional solute transport model and a two dimensional laboratory sandbox solute transport model in addition the conventional gpr method which treats the systematic model error from all model components as a lumped systematic error is called as one gpr to demonstrated the superiority of the stacked gpr method the two gpr methods i e the stacked gpr and the one gpr methods are performed for both case studies the rest part of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the methodology of gpr and stacked gpr then the description of two groundwater models and the application of methodology are presented in section 3 and section 4 respectively section 5 displays the results and section 6 is discussion finally in section 7 we draw the conclusions 2 methods 2 1 bayesian inference in groundwater system the observation z can be expressed as

dataset dq q 1 2 q hence each node performs as a standalone standard gpr eqs 15 and 16 provide the main mechanism to get the mean and variance of a target layer given the predictions of the previous layer the process of obtaining the mean and variance of prediction z is to sequentially use eqs 15 and 16 under each gpr node and layer 3 descriptions to groundwater cases in this section we described two groundwater model cases which are used to demonstrate the performance of stacked gpr method in quantifying systematic prediction error one is a synthetical groundwater transport model the other is a laboratory sandbox nacl transport experiment model 3 1 synthetical groundwater transport model the groundwater transport model is three dimensional with 1000 m in length 500 m in width and 60 m in thickness fig 4 it contains a 30 m thick unconfined aquifer with heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity k field layer 1 a 5 m thick aquitard with a local strong permeability lens layer 2 and a 25 m thick heterogeneous confined aquifer layer 3 for each model layer the model domain is divided into 1250 cells in details there are 50 cells and 25 cells among x and y directions respectively the two k fields of layer 1 and layer 3 are generated through the sequential gaussian simulator of the geostatistical library gslib deutsch and journel 1998 the details of model parameters are displayed in table 1 and the three k fields of this model are displayed by fig 5 the east and west boundaries are set to constant water heads with 35 m and 55 m respectively as shown in fig 6 a the south and north boundaries are both impermeable boundaries in layer 1 there is a contaminant source near the west boundary fig 4 and the discharge rate is 40 g d for 720 days as shown in fig 6 b moreover a total of thirty five observation wells symbols of are placed in layer 1 which record the information of the k m d the groundwater head m and the contaminant concentration mg l respectively generally it is difficult to obtain sufficient information on the aquifer s lithology and permeability distribution for example in this synthetical groundwater case we assume that it is hard to accurately depict the shape and position of the strong permeability lens due to the lack of drilling data consequently a defective model with biased description on model s k fields is usually used to represent the unknown groundwater systems in practice in this study the k fields of actually used model is built with following conceptualizations that i the k field of layer 1 is interpolated based on the k observations from the 35 observation wells through ordinary kriging ii the shape and position of the strong permeability lens of layer 2 deviate from the true situation as shown in fig 7 iii the k field of layer 3 is regarded as homogenous the simulation period is set to 1080 days the stable flow field and the distribution of contaminant in aquifers are solved by modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the groundwater heads and contaminant concentrations simulated by the true model are used as the observation data in this case study the actually used model built with systematic error is used to predict the transport process of groundwater contaminant 3 2 nacl solute transport model according to the research of guo et al 2019 the nacl solute transport experiment is constructed in a 6 6 m long 0 6 m wide 1 5 m high plexiglass tank as shown in fig 8 in this tank three different lithology sands are filled from bottom to top i e 0 5 m thick coarse sand 0 25 m thick clay and 0 4 m thick fine sand the left and right boundaries are both set to constant head boundaries and the concentration of nacl are set to 0 g l and 18 g l respectively moreover the water head of the left boundary is set to 0 95 m constantly the right boundary fluctuates periodically with the fluctuation range of 0 4 m and the cycle of 40 min the average head of the right boundary is 0 65 m the bank slope of the fine sand layer near the right boundary is set to 6 the observations are the water level and the concentration of nacl in the tank the water level is measured by pressure measuring tubes placed at the bottom of the tank and seven pressure tubes referred to as p1 to p7 are located at the distance of 0 m 0 5 m 1 5 m 2 5 m 3 5 m 4 5 m 5 5 m from the left boundary respectively the sampling times are 10th min 30th min 60th min 120th min and 180th min the total number of water head observation data is 35 two concentration sampling wells referred to as w1 and w2 are placed at the distance of 4 2 m and 5 4 m from the left boundary respectively which are used to monitor the variation of nacl concentration the sampling times are 10th min 30th min 60th min 120th min 180th min 240th min 300th min 360th min 420th min and 480th min respectively the total number of contaminant concentration observation data is 20 the three model layers are regarded as homogeneous in this nacl solute transport model and modflow and mt3d are used to solve this model and generate groundwater head and nacl concentration the simulation period is set to 480 min despite the careful artificial sand packing of the sandbox during this nacl transport experiments the assumption of homogeneous model layers could lead to inevitable systematic error in this solute transport model as well as the systematic prediction error in nacl concentration predictions 4 the application of the methods for each case study both the conventional gpr referred as one gpr and the stacked gpr methods are performed to improve groundwater predictions 4 1 synthetical groundwater transport model the structure error of the contaminant transport model is caused by the deviations in the k fields of the three model layers as stated in section 3 1 the actually used model built with systematic error is used to predict the transport of groundwater contaminant in one gpr method five physical parameters are assumed as random variables i e the longitudinal dispersion αl the transverse dispersion αt the porosity ρ the contaminant discharge rate q the contaminant discharge duration t moreover the five hyperparameters of gpr shown in eq 4 are also treated as random variables the prior information on physical parameters and hyperparameters are defined in table 2 in addition the calibration data are the contaminant concentrations at the 1080th day observed by the 35 observation wells in layer 1 fig 4 the validation data are the contaminant concentrations at the 1080th day of layer 1 excluding the cells of 35 observation wells this contaminant transport model can be divided into three components submodels that are the k field model the groundwater flow model and the advection dispersion model in sequence the propagation of systematic error through the three submodels is quantified by the stacked gpr method in the first submodel k field model the k measurements observed by the 35 observation wells fig 4 are used as model calibration data five gpr hyperparameters are regarded as random variables to be calibrated as shown in table 3 the output of the k field model i e k field of layer 1 is the input information for the second submodel groundwater flow model in the second submodel the calibration data are the groundwater heads observed by the 35 observation wells three groundwater flow model parameters and five gpr hyperparameters are regarded as random variables to be calibrated as shown in table 4 the output of the groundwater flow model i e groundwater heads is the input information for the third submodel advection dispersion model in the third submodel the calibration data are the solute concentrations at the 1080th day observed by the 35 wells two groundwater flow model parameters and five gpr hyperparameters are regarded as random variables to be calibrated as shown in table 5 to calibrate the posterior distributions of physical parameters and hyperparameters mcmc simulation are performed once and three times in one gpr and stacked gpr respectively for each mcmc simulation the dreamzs algorithm is used to search for the posterior probability spaces of parameters to be calibrated three markov chains with a burn in period of 8 000 iterations for each chain are set in mcmc simulation the iteration length of after burn in period is the same as that of burn in period moreover a classical mcmc simulation only considering the parameter uncertainty is also performed in this case study the same five groundwater model parameters as in one gpr method table 2 are calibrated and model structure error is not addressed in this mcmc this method is denoted as no gpr to evaluate the predictive performances of stacked gpr one gpr and no gpr the contaminant concentrations at the 1080th day of layer 1 excluding the cells of 35 observation wells are used as the validation data for the three methods 4 2 nacl solute transport model the systematic error of nacl solute transport arises from the assumption of homogeneous to model layers in one gpr four hydrogeological parameters are treated as random variables i e the hydraulic conductivity k 1 and the longitudinal dispersion α 1 of coarse sand layer the hydraulic conductivity k 2 and the longitudinal dispersion α 2 of fine sand layer moreover five hyperparameters of gpr are also set to random variables the details of parameter setup are displayed in table 6 the calibration data are the nacl concentration observed by the two monitor wells i e w1 and w2 at the 10th min 30th min 60th min 120th min 180th min 240th min 300th min in addition the nacl concentration at the two monitor wells at the 360th min 420th min and 480th min are used for model validation the nacl solute transport model can be divided into two components submodels in stacked gpr i e the groundwater flow model and the nacl advection dispersion model for the first submodel a gpr is built to represent the systematic error in groundwater head prediction caused by the setting of hydraulic conductivities of two model layers the calibration data are the water heads at the left five pressure tubes i e p1 to p5 at the 10th min 30th min 60th min 120th min and 180th min and the water heads observed at the right two tubes i e p6 and p7 are used for model validation moreover two physical parameters of groundwater flow model k 1 and k 2 and five gpr hyperparameters are regarded as random variables and are calibrated through mcmc simulation the details of parameters prior information are listed in table 7 the output of the first submodel i e the water head field is used as the input of the second submodel a gpr model is built to represent the systematic error in nacl concentration prediction caused by the error of water heads in addition the first seven concentration observations of both two observation points w1 and w2 are used for calibration data a total of 14 samples and the left 12 concentration observations are used for model validation two physical parameters of the advection dispersion model α 1 and α 2 and five gpr hyperparameters are calibrated through mcmc simulation and the prior information of these parameters are listed in table 8 to calibrate physical parameters and hyperparameters mcmc simulation are performed once and twice in one gpr and stacked gpr respectively for each mcmc simulation the setting details are same as that described in section 4 1 moreover a classical mcmc simulation only considering the model parameter uncertainty is also performed in this case study the same four physical parameters as in one gpr method table 6 are calibrated and model structure error is not considered this method is denoted as no gpr 5 results for each case study both stacked gpr and one gpr are performed to improve groundwater model predictions and these two methods are evaluated by comparing their performances in predicting groundwater solute transport 5 1 synthetical groundwater transport model 5 1 1 parameter calibration the left column of fig 9 shows the physical parameters posterior distributions inferred by one gpr the horizontal axis means the prior range clearly the posterior distribution of parameter αt ρ and q have much narrower ranges than the priors it means that these three parameters are sensitive to the contaminant concentration observations however the posteriors of parameters αl and t have the similar ranges to the priors the posterior distributions of physical parameters calibrated by stacked gpr are presented in the right column of fig 9 similar with the results of one gpr the three parameters αt ρ and q have the narrower posterior ranges compared with the prior ranges while the posterior ranges of α l and t are similar to that of prior distributions moreover the posterior means of the parameters αl αt and q inferred by stacked gpr are closer to the corresponding true values compared with these inferred by one gpr stacked gpr corrects the systematic errors in groundwater flow submodel and advection dispersion submodel respectively by contrast one gpr does not consider the systematic error of groundwater flow submodel specifically thus the two gpr obtained different posterior distributions of flow parameters e g ρ and t and this further leads to the inconsistent posterior distributions of advection dispersion parameters such as αl and αt 5 1 2 groundwater model predictions in one gpr the k field of layer 1 is obtained through ordinary kriging interpolation the groundwater head field is generated by modflow and the solute concentration distribution is generated by mt3dms and a gpr based complementary model in stacked gpr the k field of layer 1 is obtained through ordinary kriging interpolation and a gpr model the groundwater head field is obtained by modflow and a gpr model and the solute concentration distribution is generated in the same way as in one gpr fig 10 describes the distributions of absolute errors between the true values and that generated in one gpr and stacked gpr respectively in the first row of fig 10 the error distributions of the k field are similar for one gpr and stacked gpr and the mean absolute errors are 0 175 m d and 0 156 m d for the two methods respectively it means the systematic error in kriging interpolation model is not significant the error distributions of groundwater head fields are displayed in the second row of fig 10 obviously stacked gpr effectively reduces the head prediction errors near the north boundary compared with one gpr and the prediction errors are close for the two methods at other areas of model domain the mean absolute errors of groundwater prediction are 0 201 m and 0 101 m for the one gpr and stacked gpr methods respectively thus the systematic error of groundwater flow model is non negligible which could cause apparent influence on groundwater head predictions the third row of fig 10 represents the error distributions of contaminant concentration predictions and the mean absolute errors are 1 693 mg l and 3 089 mg l for the stacked gpr and one gpr respectively it is easy to find that stacked gpr obtains the apparently smaller predictive error of contaminant concentration than one gpr for the main contamination plume thus it is effective to improve groundwater solute concentration prediction by addressing the input error of groundwater heads to evaluate the performances of the two gpr methods in improving groundwater model prediction quantitatively the root squared mean error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean relative error mre between the true values and the predictions are calculated for validation period the lower values of rmse mae and mre mean the better predictions moreover no gpr means a classical mcmc simulation by only considering the parameters uncertainty form the table 9 we can find that the rmse mae and mre obtained by stacked gpr are slightly lower than those by one gpr for the k field model submodel 1 and groundwater flow model submodel 2 in the advection dispersion model submodel 3 the stacked gpr obtains the obviously lower rmse mae and mre values thus stacked gpr has better performance in predicting groundwater contaminant transport moreover compared to the predictions of no gpr method which only calibrating the model parameters the two gpr methods both obtained significant lower rmse mae and mre due to the consideration of systematic model error 5 2 nacl solute transport model 5 2 1 parameter calibration the left column in fig 11 presents the posterior distributions of four physical parameters estimated by one gpr all the parameters posteriors have the same ranges as priors the permeability coefficient of coarse sand k 1 obeys a multimodal distribution and the longitudinal dispersion α 1 concentrates near the upper bound meanwhile two hydrological parameters of fine sand likely obey uniform distribution we suppose that due to the deficiency of observed points in fine sand the parameters of fine sand may not be estimated well the right column is the posteriors of parameters inferred by stacked gpr we can find that stacked gpr obtains obviously higher posterior mean value of k 1 and slightly higher mean value of α 1 compared to one gpr in addition the characteristics of the posterior distributions of k 2 and α 2 are similar for the two gpr methods then the parameters posteriors are implemented in nacl solute transport model to predict nacl concentration 5 2 2 nacl solute transport predictions the nacl solute transport model is divided into two components a flow model submodel 1 and a nacl advection dispersion model submodel 2 in one gpr only the systematic error in submodel 2 is taken into account and stacked gpr addresses the systematic errors in both two submodels fig 12 shows the part of posterior probability distributions of groundwater heads in validation period we can find that the predictive distributions obtained by one gpr always have very narrow posterior ranges and low probability densities at groundwater head observations by contrast the predictive distributions obtained by stacked gpr always have relatively wider posterior ranges and higher probability densities at observations the posterior distributions of nacl concentrations are displayed in fig 13 it is easy to find that the predictions obtained by stacked gpr have apparently higher probability densities at the concentration observations of w1 compared with that by one gpr moreover the two gpr methods have the similar predictive performances on the concentration observations of w2 table 10 lists the statistics of the predictive performances of stacked gpr one gpr and no gpr and no gpr means a classical mcmc simulation by only considering the parameters uncertainty we can find that the two gpr methods obtain the similar rmse mae and mre for groundwater head predictions submodel 1 and stacked gpr has better performance in predicting nacl concentrations submodel 2 than one gpr moreover compared with no gpr both two gpr methods improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model by correcting model structure error 6 discussion in the synthetical groundwater transport model case three submodels are coupled to predict solute transport and the predictive error propagates from k field model to flow model and advection dispersion model in sequence taking rmse as a metric compared with the results of no gpr table 9 we can find that the predictive errors in k filed groundwater heads and solute concentrations were reduced by 3 41 5 15 and 60 58 respectively through stacked gpr by contrast the predictive error in solute concentrations was only reduced by 29 59 through one gpr in the nacl solute transport model case two submodels are coupled to simulate the transport of nacl and the predictive error propagates from groundwater flow model to nacl advection dispersion model similarly using rmse as a metric compared with the predictions of no gpr table 10 we can find that the predictive errors in groundwater heads and nacl concentrations were reduced by 2 94 and 83 61 respectively through stacked gpr by contrast the predictive error in nacl concentrations was reduced by 81 01 through one gpr according to the two case studies the results revealed that the errors in prior submodels could aggravate the complexity of the error of the posterior submodel though error propagation which increases the difficulty of constructing an effective error correcting model through one gpr stacked gpr can reduce the error propagation among submodels moreover it is effective to improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model by correcting the structure error of each submodel in sequence through stacked gpr based on the principle of stacked gpr we would like to emphasize that this method has some limitations in practical application such as the high computation burden the precondition of component based model and data requirement for each layer submodel of the model in addition although the total number of hyperparameters in stacked gpr is greater than that in one gpr it is important to note that stacked gpr is implemented gradually layer by layer and the number of hyperparameters in each layer is identical to that of one gpr in essence stacked gpr does not estimate more hyperparameters for each mcmc simulation than one gpr enforcing physical constraints has been an important challenge in data driven method e g the mass balance requirement of groundwater modeling recently several researches have investigated the physical constrain preservation in data driven method such as the model recalibration strategy xu and valocchi 2015 constructing an internal correction term to the model he and xiu 2016 incorporating the physical constraints of model parameters priors brynjarsdóttir and o hagan 2014 or gpr kernel function jidling et al 2017 enforcing mass balance in gpr methods will be the focus of our next work 7 conclusion the systematic model error is inevitable in hydrology groundwater model due to the simplification or biased representation of model structure generally the complex groundwater solute transport model can be divided into several coupled submodels the systematic errors of submodels and their propagation lead to great challenge for reliable model predictions to improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model we proposed to use the stacked gpr method to quantify and reduce the error propagation among the submodels in this study two case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of stacked gpr method including a synthetical groundwater transport case and a laboratory nacl solute transport experiment the key findings can be summarized as follows 1 stacked gpr can reduce the error propagation among submodels and improve model s predictive performance apparently it is effective to improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model by correcting the structure error of each submodel in sequence through stacked gpr 2 it is more feasible to correct the structure error of each submodel in sequence than to correct the lumped structure error for a component based groundwater solute transport model the errors in prior submodels could aggravate the complexity of the error of the posterior submodel though error propagation which increases the

1918,the complex groundwater solute transport model can generally be divided into several coupled submodels the systematic error is inevitable in each submodel due to the unreasonable simplification or biased representation of the true groundwater environment system the submodels systematic errors and their propagation lead to great challenge for reliable model predictions to improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model the stacked gaussian processes regression gpr method was proposed to quantify and reduce the error propagation among the submodels in this study stacked gpr corrects the structure errors of groundwater model submodel by submodel gradually two case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of stacked gpr method including a synthetical groundwater transport case and a laboratory nacl solute transport experiment the results demonstrated that stacked gpr can reduce the error propagation among submodels and improve model s predictive performance apparently moreover it is more feasible to correct the structure error of each submodel in sequence by stacked gpr than to correct the lumped structure error by traditional gpr for a component based groundwater solute transport model the errors in prior submodels could aggravate the complexity of the error of the posterior submodel though error propagation which increases the difficulty of constructing an effective error correcting model keywords stacked gaussian processes regression model structure error systematic error groundwater solute transport model prediction data availability the research data can be found in the attached datafile 1 introduction numerical models are widely used to deal with various groundwater issues such as groundwater contamination remediation and risk assessment and water resource management adombi et al 2022 enemark et al 2019 due to the complexity of groundwater environment and the lack of hydrogeological information the numerical models are often established with unreasonable model parameters and structure that lead to random and systematic model errors köpke et al 2019 markovich et al 2022 reed and kollat 2012 e g the descriptions of aquifer s structure and chemical reaction kinetics hence the produced model predictions would contain systematic error to reduce the systematic model prediction error which caused by neglecting the important elements of actual physical processes recently some researchers have proposed the data driven method ddm to improve the prediction of groundwater models kasiviswanathan et al 2019 marker et al 2017 pathiraja et al 2018 pianosi and raso 2012 ddm uses an error correcting complementary model to represent the systematic model error and this error correcting model is built statistically through the model input and output data consequently the model outputs or predictions in ddm are represented by the sum of the physical model the error correcting model and the observation error model recently gaussian processes regression gpr is one of commonly used method to build the error correcting model in ddms rasmussen and williams 2006 zhang et al 2019 for example pan et al 2021 applied gpr method to handle the systematic groundwater model error caused by complex aquifer structure and unknown kinetic processes they found that gpr can improve groundwater model predictions e g the root mean square error rmse reduced by 65 97 xu et al 2017 built an error correcting model to improve a real world regional scale groundwater model s head prediction via gpr method they concluded that the systematic model error can dramatically affect model s predictive performance and gpr reduced the predictions mean absolute error mae by 76 78 thus the gpr based ddm shows good potential for correcting the systematic model error and improving the predictive performance in groundwater modeling usually the systematic model error addressed in ddm represents the lumped error from all elements of the groundwater model demissie et al 2009 e g the settings of hydraulic conductivity field and boundary conditions and it is difficult to build a perfect complementary model to correct this complex lumped error moreover the error propagation and composition in groundwater modeling are not clearly addressed in the current researches of ddm according to the key processes of model conceptualization performing error correction for each key process respectively rather than correcting the lumped error this would potentially help further correct the systematic model error and improve model s predictive performance in addition quantifying the error propagation process in groundwater modeling can provide insights into the error generation and revealing important error sources generally a complex groundwater model is constructed by several logically related components for example a groundwater solute transport model can be usually divided into three coupled components that i the description of model medium s properties e g the hydraulic conductivity field ii the groundwater flow model and iii the advection dispersion model hence the groundwater model is modularized and hierarchical and it can be regarded as component based model moreover for the component based models the output of the former component is the input of the latter one such as the hydraulic conductivity field is the input of flow model the groundwater head is input of advection dispersion model for each component hereinafter referred to as submodel the unreasonable conceptualization could lead to systematic error that will transfer to posterior submodel through model inputs thus the model outputs or predictions generated by the last submodel are influenced by the systematic errors from all previous submodels hence for the component based model quantifying the propagation of systematic errors in the submodels is of great significance for improving model prediction abdelfatah 2019 li et al 2015 recently some researchers investigated the propagation of errors in groundwater surface water modeling e g mishra 2000 applied point estimated method to investigate the error propagation from model inputs e g pore volume and exponential decline rate to the risk of radioactive contaminants in a reservoir to human health lewis 2016 analyzed the propagation of errors from different sources of observations e g groundwater pumping water level in predicting the dynamic response of soil carbon to wetland restorations however these researches focused on the propagation of errors from different sources of observations or inputs instead of the quantification of systematic model error through the model components abdelfatah et al 2016 proposed a stacked gpr method to quantify the propagation of systematic error in an aflatoxin production model that was divided into three submodels temperature model water activity model and daily aflatoxin model stacked gpr method describes the systematic model error caused by the lack information of daily temperature distribution the unknown water content series of corn and the influence of temperature and water activity on aflatoxin production via three gprs respectively and the results demonstrated that stacked gpr can effectively handle the propagation of systematic error among submodels and improve model s prediction performance stacked gpr corrects the structure errors of groundwater model submodel by submodel gradually which provides an excellent way to quantify the propagation of systematic error for the component based groundwater contaminant transport models and improving the predictions moreover to the best of our knowledge there are currently no studies focused on quantifying systematic error propagation sequentially between submodels in groundwater models in this paper we apply the stacked gpr to improve the predictions of groundwater models by quantifying the propagation of systemic error two groundwater model cases are used in this study a synthetical three dimensional solute transport model and a two dimensional laboratory sandbox solute transport model in addition the conventional gpr method which treats the systematic model error from all model components as a lumped systematic error is called as one gpr to demonstrated the superiority of the stacked gpr method the two gpr methods i e the stacked gpr and the one gpr methods are performed for both case studies the rest part of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the methodology of gpr and stacked gpr then the description of two groundwater models and the application of methodology are presented in section 3 and section 4 respectively section 5 displays the results and section 6 is discussion finally in section 7 we draw the conclusions 2 methods 2 1 bayesian inference in groundwater system the observation z can be expressed as kennedy and o hagan 2001 1 z f x θ s x φ ϛ where f is a groundwater model x is model input θ is groundwater model parameters s is a gpr complementary model representing the systematic prediction error φ is the tuning parameters of gpr i e hyperparameters ς is the observation error based on bayesian theory the physical parameters θ and gpr hyperparameters φ are jointly calibrated the prior distribution p θ φ is specified as the product of p θ and p φ which assumes θ and φ are independent the posterior distribution p θ φ z is described as xu et al 2017 2 p θ φ z p z θ φ p θ p φ where p θ and p φ are the prior probabilities of θ and φ respectively p z θ φ is the likelihood function gaussian function is the commonly used likelihood function whose logarithm form is hoeting et al 1999 3 log p z θ φ 1 2 z f μ t σ 1 z f μ 1 2 log σ n 2 log 2 π where n is the number of observed data μ is the mean of systematic prediction error and σ is the error covariance matrix the details of μ and σ are presented in section 2 2 it is difficult to calculate the analytical expression of p θ φ z directly a convenient approach is to apply markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation to generate the posterior samples of the physical parameters θ and the gpr hyperparameters φ we implement the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dreamzs as the sampling algorithm of mcmc in this work this

inputs during calibration and validation periods respectively the prediction ς is generated from the gaussian distribution n 0 σ ϛ 2 where σ ϛ 2 is the posterior of σ ϛ 2 2 3 stacked gpr stacked gpr method addresses the systematic error of components based model by correcting the systematic error of each component in sequence fig 1 shows the flowchart of stacked gpr for a two component based model in this model x means model inputs and z is model output and the process z f x can be represented by two components that y f x and z f y respectively and y is the intermediate variable two gprs are built for the two components correspondingly the mean and variance of the posterior distribution of the predictions of stacked gpr can be obtained analytically abdelfatah et al 2018 based on the law of total expectation the posterior mean of prediction z with input x integrating out the intermediate variable y can be written as 7 e z z x e y e z z x y e z z x y is the expectation of z with input y it can be described as follows 8 e z z x y z t i 1 n σ z 1 ζ z y y i where σ z is the covariance matrix of the second gpr whose input is y and output is z fig 1 b ζz y yi is the kernel function between the predicted variable y and the ith training data point yi n is the number of training points of y for the target output z the posterior mean of z can be described as 9 e z z x z t i

layer the process of obtaining the mean and variance of prediction z is to sequentially use eqs 15 and 16 under each gpr node and layer 3 descriptions to groundwater cases in this section we described two groundwater model cases which are used to demonstrate the performance of stacked gpr method in quantifying systematic prediction error one is a synthetical groundwater transport model the other is a laboratory sandbox nacl transport experiment model 3 1 synthetical groundwater transport model the groundwater transport model is three dimensional with 1000 m in length 500 m in width and 60 m in thickness fig 4 it contains a 30 m thick unconfined aquifer with heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity k field layer 1 a 5 m thick aquitard with a local strong permeability lens layer 2 and a 25 m thick heterogeneous confined aquifer layer 3 for each model layer the model domain is divided into 1250 cells in details there are 50 cells and 25 cells among x and y directions respectively the two k fields of layer 1 and layer 3 are generated through the sequential gaussian simulator of the geostatistical library gslib deutsch and journel 1998 the details of model parameters are displayed in table 1 and the three k fields of this model are displayed by fig 5 the east and west boundaries are set to constant water heads with 35 m and 55 m respectively as shown in fig 6 a the south and north boundaries are both impermeable boundaries in layer 1 there is a contaminant source near the west boundary fig 4 and the discharge rate is 40 g d for 720 days as shown in fig 6 b moreover a total of thirty five observation wells symbols of are placed in layer 1 which record the information of the k m d the groundwater head m and the contaminant concentration mg l respectively generally it is difficult to obtain sufficient information on the aquifer s lithology and permeability distribution for example in this synthetical groundwater case we assume that it is hard to accurately depict the shape and position of the strong permeability lens due to the lack of drilling data consequently a defective model with biased description on model s k fields is usually used to represent the unknown groundwater systems in practice in this study the k fields of actually used model is built with following conceptualizations that i the k field of layer 1 is interpolated based on the k observations from the 35 observation wells through ordinary kriging ii the shape and position of the strong permeability lens of layer 2 deviate from the true situation as shown in fig 7 iii the k field of layer 3 is regarded as homogenous the simulation period is set to 1080 days the stable flow field and the distribution of contaminant in aquifers are solved by modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the groundwater heads and contaminant concentrations simulated by the true model are used as the observation data in this case study the actually used model built with systematic error is used to predict the transport process of groundwater contaminant 3 2 nacl solute transport model according to the research of guo et al 2019 the nacl solute transport experiment is constructed in a 6 6 m long 0 6 m wide 1 5 m high plexiglass tank as shown in fig 8 in this tank three different lithology sands are filled from bottom to top i e 0 5 m thick coarse sand 0 25 m thick clay and 0 4 m thick fine sand the left and right boundaries are both set to constant head boundaries and the concentration of nacl are set to 0 g l and 18 g l respectively moreover the water head of the left boundary is set to 0 95 m constantly the right boundary fluctuates periodically with the fluctuation range of 0 4 m and the cycle of 40 min the average head of the right boundary is 0 65 m the bank slope of the fine sand layer near the right boundary is set to 6 the observations are the water level and the concentration of nacl in the tank the water level is measured by pressure measuring tubes placed at the bottom of the tank and seven pressure tubes referred to as p1 to p7 are located at the distance of 0 m 0 5 m 1 5 m 2 5 m 3 5 m 4 5 m 5 5 m from the left boundary respectively the sampling times are 10th min 30th min 60th min 120th min and 180th min the total number of water head observation data is 35 two concentration sampling wells referred to as w1 and w2 are placed at the distance of 4 2 m and 5 4 m from the left boundary respectively which are used to monitor the variation of nacl concentration the sampling times are 10th min 30th min 60th min 120th min 180th min 240th min 300th min 360th min 420th min and 480th min respectively the total number of contaminant concentration observation data is 20 the three model layers are regarded as homogeneous in this nacl solute transport model and modflow and mt3d are used to solve this model and generate groundwater head and nacl concentration the simulation period is set to 480 min despite the careful artificial sand packing of the sandbox during this nacl transport experiments the assumption of homogeneous model layers could lead to inevitable systematic error in this solute transport model as well as the systematic prediction error in nacl concentration predictions 4 the application of the methods for each case study both the conventional gpr referred as one gpr and the stacked gpr methods are performed to improve groundwater predictions 4 1 synthetical groundwater transport model the structure error of the contaminant transport model is caused by the deviations in the k fields of the three model layers as stated in section 3 1 the actually used model built with systematic error is used to predict the transport of groundwater contaminant in one gpr method five physical parameters are assumed as random variables i e the longitudinal dispersion αl the transverse dispersion αt the porosity ρ the contaminant discharge rate q the contaminant discharge duration t moreover the five hyperparameters of gpr shown in eq 4 are also treated as random variables the prior information on physical parameters and hyperparameters are defined in table 2 in addition the calibration data are the contaminant concentrations at the 1080th day observed by the 35 observation wells in layer 1 fig 4 the validation data are the contaminant concentrations at the 1080th day of layer 1 excluding the cells of 35 observation wells this contaminant transport model can be divided into three components submodels that are the k field model the groundwater flow model and the advection dispersion model in sequence the propagation of systematic error through the three submodels is quantified by the stacked gpr method in the first submodel k field model the k measurements observed by the 35 observation wells fig 4 are used as model calibration data five gpr hyperparameters are regarded as random variables to be calibrated as shown in table 3 the output of the k field model i e k field of layer 1 is the input information for the second submodel groundwater flow model in the second submodel the calibration data are the groundwater heads observed by the 35 observation wells three groundwater flow model parameters and five gpr hyperparameters are regarded as random variables to be calibrated as shown in table 4 the output of the groundwater flow model i e groundwater heads is the input information for the third submodel advection dispersion model in the third submodel the calibration data are the solute concentrations at the 1080th day observed by the 35 wells two groundwater flow model parameters and five gpr hyperparameters are regarded as random variables to be calibrated as shown in table 5 to calibrate the posterior distributions of physical parameters and hyperparameters mcmc simulation are performed once and three times in one gpr and stacked gpr respectively for each mcmc simulation the dreamzs algorithm is used to search for the posterior probability spaces of parameters to be calibrated three markov chains with a burn in period of 8 000 iterations for each chain are set in mcmc simulation the iteration length of after burn in period is the same as that of burn in period moreover a classical mcmc simulation only considering the parameter uncertainty is also performed in this case study the same five groundwater model parameters as in one gpr method table 2 are calibrated and model structure error is not addressed in this mcmc this method is denoted as no gpr to evaluate the predictive performances of stacked gpr one gpr and no gpr the contaminant concentrations at the 1080th day of layer 1 excluding the cells of 35 observation wells are used as the validation data for the three methods 4 2 nacl solute transport model the systematic error of nacl solute transport arises from the assumption of homogeneous to model layers in one gpr four hydrogeological parameters are treated as random variables i e the hydraulic conductivity k 1 and the longitudinal dispersion α 1 of coarse sand layer the hydraulic conductivity k 2 and the longitudinal dispersion α 2 of fine sand layer moreover five hyperparameters of gpr are also set to random variables the details of parameter setup are displayed in table 6 the calibration data are the nacl concentration observed by the two monitor wells i e w1 and w2 at the 10th min 30th min 60th min 120th min 180th min 240th min 300th min in addition the nacl concentration at the two monitor wells at the 360th min 420th min and 480th min are used for model validation the nacl solute transport model can be divided into two components submodels in stacked gpr i e the groundwater flow model and the nacl advection dispersion model for the first submodel a gpr is built to represent the systematic error in groundwater head prediction caused by the setting of hydraulic conductivities of two model layers the calibration data are the water heads at the left five pressure tubes i e p1 to p5 at the 10th min 30th min 60th min 120th min and 180th min and the water heads observed at the right two tubes i e p6 and p7 are used for model validation moreover two physical parameters of groundwater flow model k 1 and k 2 and five gpr hyperparameters are regarded as random variables and are calibrated through mcmc simulation the details of parameters prior information are listed in table 7 the output of the first submodel i e the water head field is used as the input of the second submodel a gpr model is built to represent the systematic error in nacl concentration prediction caused by the error of water heads in addition the first seven concentration observations of both two observation points w1 and w2 are used for calibration data a total of 14 samples and the left 12 concentration observations are used for model validation two physical parameters of the advection dispersion model α 1 and α 2 and five gpr hyperparameters are calibrated through mcmc simulation and the prior information of these parameters are listed in table 8 to calibrate physical parameters and hyperparameters mcmc simulation are performed once and twice in one gpr and stacked gpr respectively for each mcmc simulation the setting details are same as that described in section 4 1 moreover a classical mcmc simulation only considering the model parameter uncertainty is also performed in this case study the same four physical parameters as in one gpr method table 6 are calibrated and model structure error is not considered this method is denoted as no gpr 5 results for each case study both stacked gpr and one gpr are performed to improve groundwater model predictions and these two methods are evaluated by comparing their performances in predicting groundwater solute transport 5 1 synthetical groundwater transport model 5 1 1 parameter calibration the left column of fig 9 shows the physical parameters posterior distributions inferred by one gpr the horizontal axis means the prior range clearly the posterior distribution of parameter αt ρ and q have much narrower ranges than the priors it means that these three parameters are sensitive to the contaminant concentration observations however the posteriors of parameters αl and t have the similar ranges to the priors the posterior distributions of physical parameters calibrated by stacked gpr are presented in the right column of fig 9 similar with the results of one gpr the three parameters αt ρ and q have the narrower posterior ranges compared with the prior ranges while the posterior ranges of α l and t are similar to that of prior distributions moreover the posterior means of the parameters αl αt and q inferred by stacked gpr are closer to the corresponding true values compared with these inferred by one gpr stacked gpr corrects the systematic errors in groundwater flow submodel and advection dispersion submodel respectively by contrast one gpr does not consider the systematic error of groundwater flow submodel specifically thus the two gpr obtained different posterior distributions of flow parameters e g ρ and t and this further leads to the inconsistent posterior distributions of advection dispersion parameters such as αl and αt 5 1 2 groundwater model predictions in one gpr the k field of layer 1 is obtained through ordinary kriging interpolation the groundwater head field is generated by modflow and the solute concentration distribution is generated by mt3dms and a gpr based complementary model in stacked gpr the k field of layer 1 is obtained through ordinary kriging interpolation and a gpr model the groundwater head field is obtained by modflow and a gpr model and the solute concentration distribution is generated in the same way as in one gpr fig 10 describes the distributions of absolute errors between the true values and that generated in one gpr and stacked gpr respectively in the first row of fig 10 the error distributions of the k field are similar for one gpr and stacked gpr and the mean absolute errors are 0 175 m d and 0 156 m d for the two methods respectively it means the systematic error in kriging interpolation model is not significant the error distributions of groundwater head fields are displayed in the second row of fig 10 obviously stacked gpr effectively reduces the head prediction errors near the north boundary compared with one gpr and the prediction errors are close for the two methods at other areas of model domain the mean absolute errors of groundwater prediction are 0 201 m and 0 101 m for the one gpr and stacked gpr methods respectively thus the systematic error of groundwater flow model is non negligible which could cause apparent influence on groundwater head predictions the third row of fig 10 represents the error distributions of contaminant concentration predictions and the mean absolute errors are 1 693 mg l and 3 089 mg l for the stacked gpr and one gpr respectively it is easy to find that stacked gpr obtains the apparently smaller predictive error of contaminant concentration than one gpr for the main contamination plume thus it is effective to improve groundwater solute concentration prediction by addressing the input error of groundwater heads to evaluate the performances of the two gpr methods in improving groundwater model prediction quantitatively the root squared mean error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean relative error mre between the true values and the predictions are calculated for validation period the lower values of rmse mae and mre mean the better predictions moreover no gpr means a classical mcmc simulation by only considering the parameters uncertainty form the table 9 we can find that the rmse mae and mre obtained by stacked gpr are slightly lower than those by one gpr for the k field model submodel 1 and groundwater flow model submodel 2 in the advection dispersion model submodel 3 the stacked gpr obtains the obviously lower rmse mae and mre values thus stacked gpr has better performance in predicting groundwater contaminant transport moreover compared to the predictions of no gpr method which only calibrating the model parameters the two gpr methods both obtained significant lower rmse mae and mre due to the consideration of systematic model error 5 2 nacl solute transport model 5 2 1 parameter calibration the left column in fig 11 presents the posterior distributions of four physical parameters estimated by one gpr all the parameters posteriors have the same ranges as priors the permeability coefficient of coarse sand k 1 obeys a multimodal distribution and the longitudinal dispersion α 1 concentrates near the upper bound meanwhile two hydrological parameters of fine sand likely obey uniform distribution we suppose that due to the deficiency of observed points in fine sand the parameters of fine sand may not be estimated well the right column is the posteriors of parameters inferred by stacked gpr we can find that stacked gpr obtains obviously higher posterior mean value of k 1 and slightly higher mean value of α 1 compared to one gpr in addition the characteristics of the posterior distributions of k 2 and α 2 are similar for the two gpr methods then the parameters posteriors are implemented in nacl solute transport model to predict nacl concentration 5 2 2 nacl solute transport predictions the nacl solute transport model is divided into two components a flow model submodel 1 and a nacl advection dispersion model submodel 2 in one gpr only the systematic error in submodel 2 is taken into account and stacked gpr addresses the systematic errors in both two submodels fig 12 shows the part of posterior probability distributions of groundwater heads in validation period we can find that the predictive distributions obtained by one gpr always have very narrow posterior ranges and low probability densities at groundwater head observations by contrast the predictive distributions obtained by stacked gpr always have relatively wider posterior ranges and higher probability densities at observations the posterior distributions of nacl concentrations are displayed in fig 13 it is easy to find that the predictions obtained by stacked gpr have apparently higher probability densities at the concentration observations of w1 compared with that by one gpr moreover the two gpr methods have the similar predictive performances on the concentration observations of w2 table 10 lists the statistics of the predictive performances of stacked gpr one gpr and no gpr and no gpr means a classical mcmc simulation by only considering the parameters uncertainty we can find that the two gpr methods obtain the similar rmse mae and mre for groundwater head predictions submodel 1 and stacked gpr has better performance in predicting nacl concentrations submodel 2 than one gpr moreover compared with no gpr both two gpr methods improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model by correcting model structure error 6 discussion in the synthetical groundwater transport model case three submodels are coupled to predict solute transport and the predictive error propagates from k field model to flow model and advection dispersion model in sequence taking rmse as a metric compared with the results of no gpr table 9 we can find that the predictive errors in k filed groundwater heads and solute concentrations were reduced by 3 41 5 15 and 60 58 respectively through stacked gpr by contrast the predictive error in solute concentrations was only reduced by 29 59 through one gpr in the nacl solute transport model case two submodels are coupled to simulate the transport of nacl and the predictive error propagates from groundwater flow model to nacl advection dispersion model similarly using rmse as a metric compared with the predictions of no gpr table 10 we can find that the predictive errors in groundwater heads and nacl concentrations were reduced by 2 94 and 83 61 respectively through stacked gpr by contrast the predictive error in nacl concentrations was reduced by 81 01 through one gpr according to the two case studies the results revealed that the errors in prior submodels could aggravate the complexity of the error of the posterior submodel though error propagation which increases the difficulty of constructing an effective error correcting model through one gpr stacked gpr can reduce the error propagation among submodels moreover it is effective to improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model by correcting the structure error of each submodel in sequence through stacked gpr based on the principle of stacked gpr we would like to emphasize that this method has some limitations in practical application such as the high computation burden the precondition of component based model and data requirement for each layer submodel of the model in addition although the total number of hyperparameters in stacked gpr is greater than that in one gpr it is important to note that stacked gpr is implemented gradually layer by layer and the number of hyperparameters in each layer is identical to that of one gpr in essence stacked gpr does not estimate more hyperparameters for each mcmc simulation than one gpr enforcing physical constraints has been an important challenge in data driven method e g the mass balance requirement of groundwater modeling recently several researches have investigated the physical constrain preservation in data driven method such as the model recalibration strategy xu and valocchi 2015 constructing an internal correction term to the model he and xiu 2016 incorporating the physical constraints of model parameters priors brynjarsdóttir and o hagan 2014 or gpr kernel function jidling et al 2017 enforcing mass balance in gpr methods will be the focus of our next work 7 conclusion the systematic model error is inevitable in hydrology groundwater model due to the simplification or biased representation of model structure generally the complex groundwater solute transport model can be divided into several coupled submodels the systematic errors of submodels and their propagation lead to great challenge for reliable model predictions to improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model we proposed to use the stacked gpr method to quantify and reduce the error propagation among the submodels in this study two case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of stacked gpr method including a synthetical groundwater transport case and a laboratory nacl solute transport experiment the key findings can be summarized as follows 1 stacked gpr can reduce the error propagation among submodels and improve model s predictive performance apparently it is effective to improve the predictive performance of groundwater solute transport model by correcting the structure error of each submodel in sequence through stacked gpr 2 it is more feasible to correct the structure error of each submodel in sequence than to correct the lumped structure error for a component based groundwater solute transport model the errors in prior submodels could aggravate the complexity of the error of the posterior submodel though error propagation which increases the

1919,impoundment of large capacity reservoirs has a great impact on groundwater flow in aquifer aquitard systems this impact occurs not only at the local scale in the dam area but also at the regional scale under particular site conditions causing unexpected geohazards and deformation phenomena in this study basin scale hydrogeological changes induced by reservoir filling and operation at the xiluodu dam site in southwest china are investigated by hierarchical numerical simulations hierarchical groundwater flow models consisting of a basin scale model 34 km in horizontal dimension and a site scale model 4 km are developed and solved with modflow and a finite element code respectively by applying the output of the basin scale model on the lateral boundaries of the site scale model the groundwater level changes in and the groundwater exchange between the confined and unconfined aquifer systems are evaluated the groundwater level in the confined aquifer has significantly increased by about 96 m beneath the dam site since reservoir filling and the dimension of the influence zone with an increase over 10 m in groundwater level reaches about 7 9 km in the basin the rate of vertical leakage from the confined to unconfined aquifer first decreases during the initial filling and then increases gradually as the pressure propagates into the confined aquifer it is predicted that the dynamically equilibrated state will be reached in 2027 the local vertical leakage occurring in the plunge pool area along the unplugged boreholes drilled during site investigation is confirmed by a calculation based on the theis formula the results are useful for decision making related to the reservoir operation and safety assessment of the dam keywords hydrogeological changes groundwater flow basin scale aquifer systems reservoir operation numerical simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anthropogenic activities such as mining tunneling and reservoir operations are one of the leading factors that impact the hydrogeological environment at the sites which may in turn induce various kinds of geohazards for instance tunneling in water rich aquifers frequently results in water inflow liu et al 2022a groundwater level decline butscher et al 2011 spring depletion liu et al 2019 and ground subsidence mahmutoğlu 2011 reservoir impoundment may induce increases in groundwater level zhou et al 2021 groundwater chemistry changes gomo and vermeulen 2013 yang et al 2018 bank collapse paronuzzi et al 2016 dam collapse mulder et al 2009 landslides zhu et al 2022 and seismicity ge et al 2009 tao et al 2015 characterizing the human induced hydrogeological changes is hence of paramount importance for understanding and mitigating these geohazards habets et al 2018 ruiz ortiz et al 2021 in recent decades quite a number of large dams over 200 m high have been constructed all over the world for water resources utilization flood control and power generation these dams typically form huge reservoirs with a capacity of several to tens of billions of cubic meters the increase of pool water level by about 200 m during reservoir filling and operation may not only significantly change the local groundwater flow behavior in the dam area but may also alter the regional groundwater flow behavior within the hydrogeological unit hu the local groundwater flow in the dam area is mainly controlled by the pool water level the seepage prevention and drainage systems and the local geological and hydrogeological settings this site scale groundwater flow behavior is a primary concern for design and construction of the dams and usually has been extensively investigated typically with a site scale model by assuming a limited dimension of the zone influenced by reservoir impoundment li et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 chen et al 2016b 2021 on the contrary the impact of reservoir operations on the regional groundwater flow behavior is of less concern in dam engineering consequently some unexpected deformation phenomena in the design phase such as the contraction of valley width between two opposite points typically at the same elevation on both banks cheng et al 2017 and the uplift of the dam liu et al 2011 occur during reservoir filling it is generally accepted that the valley width contraction at the arch dam site is induced by regional hydrogeological changes which occurs under particular geological and hydrogeological conditions e g if a regional aquitard is present below the dam foundation and hence the underlying aquifer is confined zhang et al 2022 a thorough understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal variation as well as the fundamental mechanisms of the valley width contraction calls for a detailed characterization of the reservoir operation induced hydrogeological changes at the regional scale different modelling approaches are required at the local and regional scales and hence a multi scale modelling approach is commonly used for describing the groundwater flow behavior at the two distinct scales in this approach hierarchical models are coupled through either the hydraulic head vinard et al 1997 ward et al 1987 yang et al 2009 or the exchange flux sreekanth and moore 2018 swanson et al 2006 upton et al 2020 on the boundaries of the sub model at the local scale by doing so the higher computational cost of regional scale modelling and the higher accuracy of local scale modelling could be better balanced the xiluodu arch dam of 285 5 m height is located on the lower jinsha river and situated in the center of the yongsheng basin that constitutes an independent hu since reservoir filling an accumulated valley width contraction up to 108 mm has been observed at the site which raises a need to address the reservoir operation induced hydrogeological changes at the basin scale before the deformation mechanisms can be properly understood this study investigates the basin scale hydrogeological changes at the xiluodu dam site by hierarchical numerical simulations the basin scale groundwater flow is simulated with modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 on a dimension of 34 km and the site scale groundwater flow is modelled on a dimension of 4 km by applying the result of the basin scale model on the lateral boundaries of the site scale model the groundwater level changes in the aquifer systems and the groundwater exchange between them in the basin are evaluated the local vertical leakage occurring in the plunge pool area is analyzed with the theis equation the results will help in decision making of the reservoir operation and mitigation of the resultant valley width deformation 2 site characterization 2 1 general description the xiluodu hydropower station is located on the border between leibo county sichuan province and yongshan county yunnan province lying roughly at the center of the yongsheng synclinorium basin fig 1 the station mainly consists of a concrete double curvature arch dam spillway tunnels and two underground powerhouse cavern systems fig 2 the xiluodu arch dam is the third cascade dam on the lower jinsha river situated in a deep incised valley where the jinsha river turns 90 from northeast to southeast fig 1 the xiluodu reservoir has a catchment area of 4 54 105 km2 and a total capacity of 1 27 1010 m3 the study area bounded by the watershed of the yongsheng basin ranges in altitude from 336 m to 2997 m above sea level and covers an area over 730 km2 fig 1 the basin is in a subtropical monsoon climate where over 78 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season from may to september fig 3 the mean annual precipitation is 857 7 mm based on the data collected at the leibo meteorological station at 1255 8 m elevation from june 1952 to december 2007 the mean air temperature in the study area is about 12 8 c fig 3 also plots the evaporation rate estimated by the classical budyko formula berghuijs et al 2014 chen et al 2020a wang et al 2022 perennial streams are present in the study area e g the doushaxi and xiluodu streams as illustrated in fig 4 2 2 hydrogeological settings the formations developed in the yongsheng basin mainly consist of sedimentary rocks of the silurian system s limestone of the lower permian yangxin group p1y basalt of the upper permian emeishan group p2β and sedimentary rocks of the upper permian xuanwei group p2x and the triassic system t as shown in fig 1b and table 1 the limestone formation p1y crops out on the margins of the basin along the jinsha river valley upstream of the confluence of the doushaxi stream and in the valley near xintan 15 6 km downstream of the dam site fig 4 the limestone shows varying degrees of karstification at the outcroppings and at shallow depths and is disconformably overlain by the basalt formation p2β originating from multiple magmatic and volcanic eruption episodes the basalt can be divided into 14 lava flow layers p2β1 p2β14 according to the eruption sequences typically with a shear zone or tuff layer on top of each layer chen et al 2021 between the limestone p1y and basalt p2β formations is deposited a thin clay shale layer p2βn which is no more than 5 m in thickness and rich in illite 88 97 the yongsheng basin constitutes an independent hu in which the groundwater is recharged by precipitation and melting snow and discharges to the jinsha river site characterization showed that the silurian formation s the clay shale layer p2βn and the xuanwei group p2x are of low permeability rendering aquifers and aquitards alternately distributed in the basin therefore the limestone aquifer p1y is confined replenished from precipitation along the margins where the aquifer outcrops and discharges to the jinsha river valley upstream of the confluence of the doushaxi stream and at xintan downstream of the dam site fig 4 the basalt aquifer p2β outcrops along the jinsha river hence constituting a boundary for groundwater discharge the presence of the overlying low permeability xuanwei group p2x though partially eroded fig 1b makes it difficult for precipitation to infiltrate consequently the basalt aquifer p2β has a low groundwater level with a gradient of about 15 20 in a natural state and is unconfined the permeability of the rock formations was evaluated by thousands of packer tests together with pumping tests recovery tests slug tests in situ seepage tests and inverse calibrations chen et al 2018 chen et al 2021 as listed in table 2 here the limestone formation p1y is divided into three layers according to the degree of karstification and weathering the variation of permeability with depth in the basalt p2β and limestone p1y formations is shown in fig s1 in supplementary material 2 3 groundwater observations the impoundment of the xiluodu reservoir started on november 20 2012 and the normal pool level 600 m was first attained on september 28 2014 as shown in fig 5 the pool water level curve can be divided into an initial filling phase before may 30 2014 and a normal operation period afterwards that up to now contains 8 annual cycles since the initial reservoir filling a remarkable valley width contraction was observed both upstream and downstream of the dam site fig 5 and fig s2 in supplementary material the deformation so far has grown to a magnitude of about 108 mm hence posing a potential threat to the dam safety although debates about the underlying mechanisms continue it is commonly accepted that the reservoir operation induced hydrogeological changes in the yongsheng basin play a decisive role in this deformation pattern jiang et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2023 yang et al 2015 particularly the changes in the pore water pressure and hence in the effective stress in the soft clay shale layer p2βn may be a dominant mechanism that induces this deformation phenomenon fig s2 in supplementary material during construction of the dam and the underground cavern systems a groundwater monitoring system consisting of 123 piezometers and 52 weirs was installed at the dam site chen et al 2021 this monitoring system is located in the basalt formation p2β and is used to record the groundwater flow behavior through the dam foundation to further understand the groundwater changes induced by reservoir operations a total of 17 observation boreholes were drilled around the dam site and in the plunge pool area since december 15 2018 fig 2 these boreholes are used to collect the groundwater level and temperature data in the p2β basalt layer xzk01 and xzk04 xzk10 and in the p1y limestone layer xzk02 xzk03 and hzk01 hzk07 respectively the earliest data collection in these boreholes started on february 28 2019 and extended until march 20 2022 in this study 3 methods 3 1 hierarchical numerical model the continuum approach is applied in this study to describe the groundwater flow in the aquifer aquitard systems both at the basin scale and at the local scale of the dam foundation the flow is assumed to follow the darcy s law and the continuity equation for the transient process can be written as 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z q s s h t where h is the hydraulic head kx ky and kz are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y and z directions respectively q is a source sink term representing recharge or pumping s s is the specific storage and t is time in this study we use kx ky k h and kz k v to account for permeability anisotropy where k h and k v are the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities respectively the basin scale model is shown in fig 6 whose boundary is aligned with the boundary of the hu the model covers an area of 730 51 km2 with a maximum length of 34 3 km in the ns direction and a maximum width of 31 8 km in the ew direction modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 is utilized for its flexibility in watershed scale flow simulations banihabib et al 2018 laveti et al 2021 milzow and kinzelbach 2010 this simulator uses the finite difference approach with the local refinement method to solve the continuity equation mehl and hill 2002 2004 hence the topographic and hydrogeological settings can be well represented with an acceptable computational cost the model is meshed into 20 layers by unstructured grids with 4 layers for the clay shale layer p2βn in particular the model contains a total of 1 211 720 cells and 1 462 650 nodes the groundwater flow modelling at the basin scale is able to roughly understand the flow behavior in the aquifer aquitard systems but is hard to characterize the detailed flow dynamics in the dam foundation the groundwater flow at this near field scale is not only influenced by the lateral recharge from the basin but more controlled by the local geological settings the increase of pool water level and the construction of the dam underground caverns and the seepage control system consisting of grout curtains and numerous drains chen et al 2021 to better describe the flow behavior at these two distinct scales a site scale submodel is developed this submodel has a horizontal dimension of about 4000 m and a height of 1000 m which represents in detail the local geological settings the hydraulic structures and the seepage control system fig s3 in supplementary material chen et al 2021 the site scale submodel is solved with the finite element code thyme3d which has been validated and extensively applied in site scale studies chen et al 2011 chen et al 2021 chen et al 2023 and uses the hydraulic head data from the basin scale model on the lateral boundaries to represent the lateral recharge into the dam foundation by doing so both the flow behavior at the basin scale 34 km and at the site scale 4 km can be better understood 3 2 numerical setup the hydraulic properties of the formations including aquifers and aquitards in the study area are listed in table 2 in which the hydraulic conductivity values are determined by hydraulic tests and inverse modelling chen et al 2018 chen et al 2020b chen et al 2021 the specific storage s s is estimated by s s ρ w g α r ϕα w where ρ w is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration α r is the compressibility of rock α w is the compressibility of water and ϕ is the porosity the specific yield s y a parameter needed for description of water storage or release in the formations due to fluctuation of water table is estimated by laboratory tests and calibrated with the value of ϕ for the basin scale model the base and lateral boundary are prescribed with no flow boundary condition given the fact that the basin is an independent hu bounded with a thick aquitard s at the bottom the ground surface of the model is set as an infiltration boundary and the infiltration coefficient c i is determined by field characterization and numerical calibration the values of c i are 0 3 in the limestone p1y outcrops and 0 02 in the triassic formation t outcrops underlain by the regional aquitard p2x as shown in fig s4 in supplementary material the calibrated values of c i are comparable to the data by luo and li 2021 and mao et al 2021 respectively the pool water level and the downstream river stage since reservoir filling are plotted in fig 5 which are extrapolated according to their fluctuation patterns until the end of 2030 for future predictions the basin scale groundwater flow modelling starts on january 1 2012 and ends on december 31 2030 with a maximum time step of 10 d before the simulation starts a natural infiltration evaporation process lasting for 40 years from january 1 1972 to january 1 2012 is first simulated which yields an initial head distribution for the input and minimizes the influence of the initial condition on the flow simulation the initial and boundary conditions of the site scale model are depicted in chen et al 2021 with a slight difference in the condition on the lateral boundaries which is prescribed with the head data output by the basin scale model at the same time points 4 results 4 1 groundwater flow behavior in the confined aquifer p1y the presence of the thin clay shale layer p2βn makes the groundwater flow relatively independent in the limestone p1y and basalt p2β formations with the former system being confined and the latter one being unconfined for the confined limestone p1y aquifer there are only 9 available boreholes around the dam site for groundwater level observation fig 2 the errors between the numerical data r and the measurement data z at a borehole are evaluated by three commonly used metrics 2 mae 1 n i 1 n r i z i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n r i z i 2 4 mape 1 n i 1 n r i z i z i 100 where mae is the mean absolute error rmse is the root mean square error and mape is the mean absolute percent error mape ri and zi are the numerically obtained and measured hydraulic heads at time point i respectively fig 7 compares the simulated and observed groundwater levels in the confined limestone aquifer showing that the numerical results reasonably capture the groundwater dynamics around the dam site in recent three years the errors between the simulation results and measurements are listed in table 3 with mae rmse and mape varying in the ranges of 3 7 34 2 m 5 7 34 5 m and 0 7 6 1 respectively large biases occur at boreholes hzk05 and hzk06 located in the left bank with the calculated piezometric heads consistently lower than the measurements these biases are possibly induced by local hydrogeological settings but given the scale of the problem the simulation is considered to reasonably reproduce the groundwater flow behavior after reservoir operations before reservoir filling the initial distribution of piezometric head on the ceiling of the confined limestone p1y aquifer on january 1 2012 is plotted in fig 8 which is obtained by a simulation of 40 annual precipitation evaporation cycles the result well characterizes the groundwater flow behavior in the confined p1y aquifer in its natural state with groundwater mainly replenished from the limestone outcrops located on the northwest and southeast margins of the basin and discharging to the jinsha river valley upstream of the dam site and near xintan downstream of the dam site fig 1a and 4 the groundwater flows on both banks are relatively independent which is also consistent with site characterization results figs 9 and 10 show the reservoir operation induced changes in piezometric head on the ceiling of the confined p1y aquifer as compared to its initial distribution on january 1 2012 fig 8 these results confirm that the reservoir filling and operation leads to a continuous increase of piezometric head in the limestone aquifer and that the influence zone expands drastically as time evolves especially in the first seven years of operation before the end of 2019 fig 9a e afterwards the hydrogeological changes in the basin continue but the rate of change decreases to a relatively stable state fig 9f h and 10 the simulation indicates that groundwater flow in the confined limestone aquifer may reach a dynamically equilibrated state by the end of 2027 fig 10 quantified by a sufficiently small variation less than 1 m of piezometric head in the p1y aquifer beneath the dam site it can be observed from fig 9 that the highest increase of piezometric head over 200 m in the limestone aquifer occurs along the valley upstream of the confluence of the doushaxi stream where the limestone outcrops and the piezometric head change is directly related to the increase of the pool water level with the increase of distance towards the river banks or the downstream direction the change of piezometric head decreases due to head loss and the change of the aquifer s geometry figs 10 and 11 by april 2022 the piezometric head increase in the confined limestone aquifer beneath the dam site is 95 9 m which is supported by the borehole observations fig 7 evaluated by an increase over 10 m in piezometric head the dimension of the influence zone is about 7 0 km on the left bank and 9 0 km on the right bank these drastic changes in the magnitude of piezometric head and the dimension of the influence zone are possibly the reason for the valley width deformation fig s2 in supplementary material beneath the west entrance of the dahewan tunnel see fig 1a the predicted piezometric head increase is about 17 m at this tunnel entrance a valley width measurement line tm7 tm9 was installed which recorded an accumulated deformation of about 1 mm by august 1 2020 this measurement indicates that this location is on the border of the influence zone fig 4 hence justifying the simulation results in this study 4 2 groundwater flow behavior in the unconfined aquifer p2β the groundwater flow behavior in the unconfined basalt p2β aquifer is mainly governed by the fluctuations of pool water level and the seepage control system consisting of grout curtains and numerous drains and less influenced by the rainfall events chen et al 2021 only the near bank zone upstream of the dam site is influenced by reservoir filling and operation and its dimension is much smaller than that of the underlying confined aquifer a detailed description of the flow behavior and a complete comparison between the measurements and the simulations have been given in chen et al 2021 fracture clogging by fine grained sediments plays an important role in permeability variation of the near bank rocks and leads to a continuous decrease of discharge from the drainage systems chen et al 2021 the simulation shows that a dynamically steady state condition can be attained in 2024 which is three years earlier than the confined flow in the limestone aquifer 4 3 water exchange between the two aquifer systems the confined and unconfined flow systems are separated by the low permeability clay shale layer p2βn this aquitard is typically 2 3 m in thickness table 1 and vertical leakage is expected to occur between these two flow systems fig 12 shows the piezometric head difference between the ceiling of the confined limestone aquifer and the floor of the unconfined basalt aquifer indicating that the pore water pressure in the confined aquifer is consistently and remarkably higher than that in the unconfined aquifer the mean of the head difference in the basin was about 125 83 m in april 2022 at the dam site the head difference was about 113 27 150 72 m comparable to the range 131 35 178 60 m of borehole observations before reservoir filling the rate of leakage from the confined aquifer to the unconfined aquifer was about 400 l s which decreased to about 250 l s during the initial impoundment of the reservoir as a result of faster transmission of water pressure in the basalt aquifer fig 13 then the leakage rate increases slightly to a mean of about 300 l s as the pool water level fluctuates and transmits the pressure in the confined aquifer in addition there is a local leakage between these two aquifers in the plunge pool area this local leakage is caused by 28 boreholes drilled during site investigation see fig 2 for their locations which penetrated into the limestone aquifer but were not properly plugged afterwards chen et al 2021 chen et al 2023 the local leakage has been confirmed by groundwater temperature analysis hydrochemical analysis cross correlation analysis and site scale inverse modelling zhou et al 2021 chen et al 2021 chen et al 2023 but this feature is not considered in the basin scale simulation given that the limestone aquifer is confined the unplugged boreholes could be regarded as artesian wells that bring the confined groundwater to the drains at the base of the plunge pool by conceptualizing the unplugged boreholes as one virtual complete well located in the center of the plunge pool we apply the theis formula theis 1935 to further examine the relationship between the local leakage rate and hydraulic head distribution in the confined limestone aquifer 5 s q 4 π t w u where s is the drawdown of groundwater table in a confined aquifer q is the pumping rate i e the leakage rate in this study t kb is the transmissivity of the confined aquifer k is the hydraulic conductivity b is the thickness of the aquifer u is a dimensionless factor and w u is the exponential integral well function given by 6 u s s r 2 4 t t 7 w u u e y y d y where t is the pumping time and s s is the specific storage when the pumping rate q is non constant the transient drawdown of the groundwater table in the confined aquifer at any time tn can be simulated based on the principle of superposition bear 1979 8 s r t n 1 4 π t i 1 n q i q i 1 w s s r 2 4 t t i t i 1 where r is the radial distance away from the pumping well i is the index of time interval and n is the number of time intervals with t 0 0 and q 0 0 given the fact that only a portion α less than 1 of the discharge in the plunge pool area originates from the confined aquifer we use the discharge data and borehole observation data to calibrate α and the hydraulic properties of the aquifer k b and s s with α 47 5 k 1 5 10 6 m s b 280 m and s s 3 5 10 6 m 1 the calibrated values of k b and s s are comparable to the data given in tables 1 and 2 and the value of α is rather close to that obtained by site scale simulation 44 on average chen et al 2023 as shown in fig 14 we map the observation boreholes in the r z plane according to their distances to the center of the plunge pool and compare the calculated and measured groundwater levels at different times with a mean mae of about 12 49 m over all the boreholes the result shows a clear trend of radial flow in the confined aquifer towards the virtual well confirming that the local leakage from the confined aquifer does take place through the unplugged boreholes in the plunge pool area 5 discussion site scale models on a dimension ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters are widely used in the analysis of seepage through dams and or their foundations e g chen et al 2016a chen et al 2016b chen et al 2021 li et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 these models generally work well for safety assessment of dams optimization design of seepage prevention barriers and drainage systems and inverse modelling of local groundwater flow behavior through the dams the application of the site scale models assumes that the groundwater flow caused by reservoir filling and operation mainly occurs on a limited scale in the dam area and that the impact on the groundwater levels in the far field regions is small even for large dams over 200 m high there is less concern on the reservoir operation induced hydrogeological changes on the scale of hus that is much larger than the scale of sites under some particular hydrogeological settings e g when a confined aquifer is present beneath the dam the hydrogeological changes may in turn induce significant abnormal deformation e g dam uplift and valley width contraction that is unexpected in the design phase liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 this study is motivated by the urgent need to assess the hydrogeological changes at the basin scale induced by the filling and operation of the xiluodu reservoir an essential prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of valley width contraction fig s2 in supplementary material the predicted dimension of the influence zone in the confined aquifer system is about 7 9 km from the reservoir which is smaller than the result about 11 km in 2020 predicted by zhang et al 2021 even though the initial predictions in 2014 about 3 9 km are almost the same this difference possibly originates from the much smaller value of s s 5 10 7 m 1 used by zhang et al 2021 obviously this dimension of the influence zone is site dependent and it could even be larger than that of tunneling zheng et al 2021 and coal mining sreekanth et al 2020 that cause regional groundwater drawdown furthermore this study predicts that a dynamically steady state flow condition in the confined aquifer can be reached in 2027 which lies between 2024 and 2028 predicted by regression analysis li et al 2020 and coupled thermo hydro mechanical modelling yin et al 2020 for the convergence time of the valley width contraction at the site respectively this study uses a hierarchical numerical model consisting of a basin scale model and a local site scale model to evaluate groundwater flow behavior in the confined and unconfined aquifer systems and groundwater exchange between them for basin scale and even site scale modelling the continuum approach is usually the primary choice finsterle 2000 oda 1986 xu et al 2015 and hence the accuracy of the simulations depends on how the site conditions are characterized and how the aquifer parameters are determined chen et al 2020b the limited data availability is another issue commonly confronted in regional scale modelling liu et al 2022b person et al 1996 ruybal et al 2019 which may also influence the accuracy of the assessment as a major limitation of this study only the output of the basin scale model is fed into the site scale model to consider the lateral recharge from the basin while the result of the site scale model is not fed back to the basin scale model in fact the groundwater flow behavior at the site scale is controlled by various factors such as the pool water level the seepage prevention and drainage systems and the local leakage along the unplugged boreholes drilled during site investigation in addition to the local geological and hydrogeological settings the local flow behavior may impact to some extent groundwater flow at the basin scale and this issue could be addressed with a coupled basin scale and site scale model in the near future 6 conclusions this study evaluates the basin scale hydrogeological changes induced by reservoir filling and operation at the xiluodu dam site using field observations and hierarchical numerical simulations the yongsheng basin where the dam is situated is identified as an independent hu with complex aquifer aquitard systems a basin scale model 34 km and a site scale model 4 km were created with the former being simulated by modflow and the latter being solved with a finite element code the simulated piezometric head from the basin scale model was applied on the lateral boundaries of the site scale model to approximate the lateral recharge from the basin to the dam site both the changes in groundwater level in the aquifer systems and groundwater exchange between them are evaluated by numerical simulations our results and analysis show that the confined aquifer system is more influenced by the impoundment of the reservoir and that the magnitude of the groundwater level and the dimension of the influence zone grew significantly in the first seven years of operation 2013 2019 at present the increase in groundwater level reaches a maximum equal to the increase in pool water level in the outcrops of the confined aquifer along the valley in the reservoir area and has a magnitude of about 96 m beneath the dam site the dimension of the influence zone with an increase in groundwater level over 10 m is about 7 9 km towards the river banks and the downstream direction the rate of upward vertical leakage from the confined to unconfined aquifer decreased in the first year of filling 2013 and then increases gradually towards a dynamic steady state which is predicted to be attained in 2027 the local vertical leakage occurring in the plunge pool area along the unplugged boreholes drilled during site investigation is quantified and confirmed with calculations based on the theis formula this work helps in understanding the basin scale hydrogeological changes and the resultant valley width deformation induced by reservoir filling and operation but as a major limitation of this study the result of the site scale model is not fed back to the basin scale model and this issue will be addressed with a coupled model in the near future credit authorship contribution statement yi feng chen

1919,impoundment of large capacity reservoirs has a great impact on groundwater flow in aquifer aquitard systems this impact occurs not only at the local scale in the dam area but also at the regional scale under particular site conditions causing unexpected geohazards and deformation phenomena in this study basin scale hydrogeological changes induced by reservoir filling and operation at the xiluodu dam site in southwest china are investigated by hierarchical numerical simulations hierarchical groundwater flow models consisting of a basin scale model 34 km in horizontal dimension and a site scale model 4 km are developed and solved with modflow and a finite element code respectively by applying the output of the basin scale model on the lateral boundaries of the site scale model the groundwater level changes in and the groundwater exchange between the confined and unconfined aquifer systems are evaluated the groundwater level in the confined aquifer has significantly increased by about 96 m beneath the dam site since reservoir filling and the dimension of the influence zone with an increase over 10 m in groundwater level reaches about 7 9 km in the basin the rate of vertical leakage from the confined to unconfined aquifer first decreases during the initial filling and then increases gradually as the pressure propagates into the confined aquifer it is predicted that the dynamically equilibrated state will be reached in 2027 the local vertical leakage occurring in the plunge pool area along the unplugged boreholes drilled during site investigation is confirmed by a calculation based on the theis formula the results are useful for decision making related to the reservoir operation and safety assessment of the dam keywords hydrogeological changes groundwater flow basin scale aquifer systems reservoir operation numerical simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anthropogenic activities such as mining tunneling and reservoir operations are one of the leading factors that impact the hydrogeological environment at the sites which may in turn induce various kinds of geohazards for instance tunneling in water rich aquifers frequently results in water inflow liu et al 2022a groundwater level decline butscher et al 2011 spring depletion liu et al 2019 and ground subsidence mahmutoğlu 2011 reservoir impoundment may induce increases in groundwater level zhou et al 2021 groundwater chemistry changes gomo and vermeulen 2013 yang et al 2018 bank collapse paronuzzi et al 2016 dam collapse mulder et al 2009 landslides zhu et al 2022 and seismicity ge et al 2009 tao et al 2015 characterizing the human induced hydrogeological changes is hence of paramount importance for understanding and mitigating these geohazards habets et al 2018 ruiz ortiz et al 2021 in recent decades quite a number of large dams over 200 m high have been constructed all over the world for water resources utilization flood control and power generation these dams typically form huge reservoirs with a capacity of several to tens of billions of cubic meters the increase of pool water level by about 200 m during reservoir filling and operation may not only significantly change the local groundwater flow behavior in the dam area but may also alter the regional groundwater flow behavior within the hydrogeological unit hu the local groundwater flow in the dam area is mainly controlled by the pool water level the seepage prevention and drainage systems and the local geological and hydrogeological settings this site scale groundwater flow behavior is a primary concern for design and construction of the dams and usually has been extensively investigated typically with a site scale model by assuming a limited dimension of the zone influenced by reservoir impoundment li et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 chen et al 2016b 2021 on the contrary the impact of reservoir operations on the regional groundwater flow behavior is of less concern in dam engineering consequently some unexpected deformation phenomena in the design phase such as the contraction of valley width between two opposite points typically at the same elevation on both banks cheng et al 2017 and the uplift of the dam liu et al 2011 occur during reservoir filling it is generally accepted that the valley width contraction at the arch dam site is induced by regional hydrogeological changes which occurs under particular geological and hydrogeological conditions e g if a regional aquitard is present below the dam foundation and hence the underlying aquifer is confined zhang et al 2022 a thorough understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal variation as well as the fundamental mechanisms of the valley width contraction calls for a detailed characterization of the reservoir operation induced hydrogeological changes at the regional scale different modelling approaches are required at the local and regional scales and hence a multi scale modelling approach is commonly used for describing the groundwater flow behavior at the two distinct scales in this approach hierarchical models are coupled through either the hydraulic head vinard et al 1997 ward et al 1987 yang et al 2009 or the exchange flux sreekanth and moore 2018 swanson et al 2006 upton et al 2020 on the boundaries of the sub model at the local scale by doing so the higher computational cost of regional scale modelling and the higher accuracy of local scale modelling could be better balanced the xiluodu arch dam of 285 5 m height is located on the lower jinsha river and situated in the center of the yongsheng basin that constitutes an independent hu since reservoir filling an accumulated valley width contraction up to 108 mm has been observed at the site which raises a need to address the reservoir operation induced hydrogeological changes at the basin scale before the deformation mechanisms can be properly understood this study investigates the basin scale hydrogeological changes at the xiluodu dam site by hierarchical numerical simulations the basin scale groundwater flow is simulated with modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 on a dimension of 34 km and the site scale groundwater flow is modelled on a dimension of 4 km by applying the result of the basin scale model on the lateral boundaries of the site scale model the groundwater level changes in the aquifer systems and the groundwater exchange between them in the basin are evaluated the local vertical leakage occurring in the plunge pool area is analyzed with the theis equation the results will help in decision making of the reservoir operation and mitigation of the resultant valley width deformation 2 site characterization 2 1 general description the xiluodu hydropower station is located on the border between leibo county sichuan province and yongshan county yunnan province lying roughly at the center of the yongsheng synclinorium basin fig 1 the station mainly consists of a concrete double curvature arch dam spillway tunnels and two underground powerhouse cavern systems fig 2 the xiluodu arch dam is the third cascade dam on the lower jinsha river situated in a deep incised valley where the jinsha river turns 90 from northeast to southeast fig 1 the xiluodu reservoir has a catchment area of 4 54 105 km2 and a total capacity of 1 27 1010 m3 the study area bounded by the watershed of the yongsheng basin ranges in altitude from 336 m to 2997 m above sea level and covers an area over 730 km2 fig 1 the basin is in a subtropical monsoon climate where over 78 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season from may to september fig 3 the mean annual precipitation is 857 7 mm based on the data collected at the leibo meteorological station at 1255 8 m elevation from june 1952 to december 2007 the mean air temperature in the study area is about 12 8 c fig 3 also plots the evaporation rate estimated by the classical budyko formula berghuijs et al 2014 chen et al 2020a wang et al 2022 perennial streams are present in the study area e g the doushaxi and xiluodu streams as illustrated in fig 4 2 2 hydrogeological settings the formations developed in the yongsheng basin mainly consist of sedimentary rocks of the silurian system s limestone of the lower permian yangxin group p1y basalt of the upper permian emeishan group p2β and sedimentary rocks of the upper permian xuanwei group p2x and the triassic system t as shown in fig 1b and table 1 the limestone formation p1y crops out on the margins of the basin along the jinsha river valley upstream of the confluence of the doushaxi stream and in the valley near xintan 15 6 km downstream of the dam site fig 4 the limestone shows varying degrees of karstification at the outcroppings and at shallow depths and is disconformably overlain by the basalt formation p2β originating from multiple magmatic and volcanic eruption episodes the basalt can be divided into 14 lava flow layers p2β1 p2β14 according to the eruption sequences typically with a shear zone or tuff layer on top of each layer chen et al 2021 between the limestone p1y and basalt p2β formations is deposited a thin clay shale layer p2βn which is no more than 5 m in thickness and rich in illite 88 97 the yongsheng basin constitutes an independent hu in which the groundwater is recharged by precipitation and melting snow and discharges to the jinsha river site characterization showed that the silurian formation s the clay shale layer p2βn and the xuanwei group p2x are of low permeability rendering aquifers and aquitards alternately distributed in the basin therefore the limestone aquifer p1y is confined replenished from precipitation along the margins where the aquifer outcrops and discharges to the jinsha river valley upstream of the confluence of the doushaxi stream and at xintan downstream of the dam site fig 4 the basalt aquifer p2β outcrops along the jinsha river hence constituting a boundary for groundwater discharge the presence of the overlying low permeability xuanwei group p2x though partially eroded fig 1b makes it difficult for precipitation to infiltrate consequently the basalt aquifer p2β has a low groundwater level with a gradient of about 15 20 in a natural state and is unconfined the permeability of the rock formations was evaluated by thousands of packer tests together with pumping tests recovery tests slug tests in situ seepage tests and inverse calibrations chen et al 2018 chen et al 2021 as listed in table 2 here the limestone formation p1y is divided into three layers according to the degree of karstification and weathering the variation of permeability with depth in the basalt p2β and limestone p1y formations is shown in fig s1 in supplementary material 2 3 groundwater observations the impoundment of the xiluodu reservoir started on november 20 2012 and the normal pool level 600 m was first attained on september 28 2014 as shown in fig 5 the pool water level curve can be divided into an initial filling phase before may 30 2014 and a normal operation period afterwards that up to now contains 8 annual cycles since the initial reservoir filling a remarkable valley width contraction was observed both upstream and downstream of the dam site fig 5 and fig s2 in supplementary material the deformation so far has grown to a magnitude of about 108 mm hence posing a potential threat to the dam safety although debates about the underlying mechanisms continue it is commonly accepted that the reservoir operation induced hydrogeological changes in the yongsheng basin play a decisive role in this deformation pattern jiang et al 2020 li et al 2020 wang et al 2023 yang et al 2015 particularly the changes in the pore water pressure and hence in the effective stress in the soft clay shale layer p2βn may be a dominant mechanism that induces this deformation phenomenon fig s2 in supplementary material during construction of the dam and the underground cavern systems a groundwater monitoring system consisting of 123 piezometers and 52 weirs was installed at the dam site chen et al 2021 this monitoring system is located in the basalt formation p2β and is used to record the groundwater flow behavior through the dam foundation to further understand the groundwater changes induced by reservoir operations a total of 17 observation boreholes were drilled around the dam site and in the plunge pool area since december 15 2018 fig 2 these boreholes are used to collect the groundwater level and temperature data in the p2β basalt layer xzk01 and xzk04 xzk10 and in the p1y limestone layer xzk02 xzk03 and hzk01 hzk07 respectively the earliest data collection in these boreholes started on february 28 2019 and extended until march 20 2022 in this study 3 methods 3 1 hierarchical numerical model the continuum approach is applied in this study to describe the groundwater flow in the aquifer aquitard systems both at the basin scale and at the local scale of the dam foundation the flow is assumed to follow the darcy s law and the continuity equation for the transient process can be written as 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z q s s h t where h is the hydraulic head kx ky and kz are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y and z directions respectively q is a source sink term representing recharge or pumping s s is the specific storage and t is time in this study we use kx ky k h and kz k v to account for permeability anisotropy where k h and k v are the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities respectively the basin scale model is shown in fig 6 whose boundary is aligned with the boundary of the hu the model covers an area of 730 51 km2 with a maximum length of 34 3 km in the ns direction and a maximum width of 31 8 km in the ew direction modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 is utilized for its flexibility in watershed scale flow simulations banihabib et al 2018 laveti et al 2021 milzow and kinzelbach 2010 this simulator uses the finite difference approach with the local refinement method to solve the continuity equation mehl and hill 2002 2004 hence the topographic and hydrogeological settings can be well represented with an acceptable computational cost the model is meshed into 20 layers by unstructured grids with 4 layers for the clay shale layer p2βn in particular the model contains a total of 1 211 720 cells and 1 462 650 nodes the groundwater flow modelling at the basin scale is able to roughly understand the flow behavior in the aquifer aquitard systems but is hard to characterize the detailed flow dynamics in the dam foundation the groundwater flow at this near field scale is not only influenced by the lateral recharge from the basin but more controlled by the local geological settings the increase of pool water level and the construction of the dam underground caverns and the seepage control system consisting of grout curtains and numerous drains chen et al 2021 to better describe the flow behavior at these two distinct scales a site scale submodel is developed this submodel has a horizontal dimension of about 4000 m and a height of 1000 m which represents in detail the local geological settings the hydraulic structures and the seepage control system fig s3 in supplementary material chen et al 2021 the site scale submodel is solved with the finite element code thyme3d which has been validated and extensively applied in site scale studies chen et al 2011 chen et al 2021 chen et al 2023 and uses the hydraulic head data from the basin scale model on the lateral boundaries to represent the lateral recharge into the dam foundation by doing so both the flow behavior at the basin scale 34 km and at the site scale 4 km can be better understood 3 2 numerical setup the hydraulic properties of the formations including aquifers and aquitards in the study area are listed in table 2 in which the hydraulic conductivity values are determined by hydraulic tests and inverse modelling chen et al 2018 chen et al 2020b chen et al 2021 the specific storage s s is estimated by s s ρ w g α r ϕα w where ρ w is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration α r is the compressibility of rock α w is the compressibility of water and ϕ is the porosity the specific yield s y a parameter needed for description of water storage or release in the formations due to fluctuation of water table is estimated by laboratory tests and calibrated with the value of ϕ for the basin scale model the base and lateral boundary are prescribed with no flow boundary condition given the fact that the basin is an independent hu bounded with a thick aquitard s at the bottom the ground surface of the model is set as an infiltration boundary and the infiltration coefficient c i is determined by field characterization and numerical calibration the values of c i are 0 3 in the limestone p1y outcrops and 0 02 in the triassic formation t outcrops underlain by the regional aquitard p2x as shown in fig s4 in supplementary material the calibrated values of c i are comparable to the data by luo and li 2021 and mao et al 2021 respectively the pool water level and the downstream river stage since reservoir filling are plotted in fig 5 which are extrapolated according to their fluctuation patterns until the end of 2030 for future predictions the basin scale groundwater flow modelling starts on january 1 2012 and ends on december 31 2030 with a maximum time step of 10 d before the simulation starts a natural infiltration evaporation process lasting for 40 years from january 1 1972 to january 1 2012 is first simulated which yields an initial head distribution for the input and minimizes the influence of the initial condition on the flow simulation the initial and boundary conditions of the site scale model are depicted in chen et al 2021 with a slight difference in the condition on the lateral boundaries which is prescribed with the head data output by the basin scale model at the same time points 4 results 4 1 groundwater flow behavior in the confined aquifer p1y the presence of the thin clay shale layer p2βn makes the groundwater flow relatively independent in the limestone p1y and basalt p2β formations with the former system being confined and the latter one being unconfined for the confined limestone p1y aquifer there are only 9 available boreholes around the dam site for groundwater level observation fig 2 the errors between the numerical data r and the measurement data z at a borehole are evaluated by three commonly used metrics 2 mae 1 n i 1 n r i z i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n r i z i 2 4 mape 1 n i 1 n r i z i z i 100 where mae is the mean absolute error rmse is the root mean square error and mape is the mean absolute percent error mape ri and zi are the numerically obtained and measured hydraulic heads at time point i respectively fig 7 compares the simulated and observed groundwater levels in the confined limestone aquifer showing that the numerical results reasonably capture the groundwater dynamics around the dam site in recent three years the errors between the simulation results and measurements are listed in table 3 with mae rmse and mape varying in the ranges of 3 7 34 2 m 5 7 34 5 m and 0 7 6 1 respectively large biases occur at boreholes hzk05 and hzk06 located in the left bank with the calculated piezometric heads consistently lower than the measurements these biases are possibly induced by local hydrogeological settings but given the scale of the problem the simulation is considered to reasonably reproduce the groundwater flow behavior after reservoir operations before reservoir filling the initial distribution of piezometric head on the ceiling of the confined limestone p1y aquifer on january 1 2012 is plotted in fig 8 which is obtained by a simulation of 40 annual precipitation evaporation cycles the result well characterizes the groundwater flow behavior in the confined p1y aquifer in its natural state with groundwater mainly replenished from the limestone outcrops located on the northwest and southeast margins of the basin and discharging to the jinsha river valley upstream of the dam site and near xintan downstream of the dam site fig 1a and 4 the groundwater flows on both banks are relatively independent which is also consistent with site characterization results figs 9 and 10 show the reservoir operation induced changes in piezometric head on the ceiling of the confined p1y aquifer as compared to its initial distribution on january 1 2012 fig 8 these results confirm that the reservoir filling and operation leads to a continuous increase of piezometric head in the limestone aquifer and that the influence zone expands drastically as time evolves especially in the first seven years of operation before the end of 2019 fig 9a e afterwards the hydrogeological changes in the basin continue but the rate of change decreases to a relatively stable state fig 9f h and 10 the simulation indicates that groundwater flow in the confined limestone aquifer may reach a dynamically equilibrated state by the end of 2027 fig 10 quantified by a sufficiently small variation less than 1 m of piezometric head in the p1y aquifer beneath the dam site it can be observed from fig 9 that the highest increase of piezometric head over 200 m in the limestone aquifer occurs along the valley upstream of the confluence of the doushaxi stream where the limestone outcrops and the piezometric head change is directly related to the increase of the pool water level with the increase of distance towards the river banks or the downstream direction the change of piezometric head decreases due to head loss and the change of the aquifer s geometry figs 10 and 11 by april 2022 the piezometric head increase in the confined limestone aquifer beneath the dam site is 95 9 m which is supported by the borehole observations fig 7 evaluated by an increase over 10 m in piezometric head the dimension of the influence zone is about 7 0 km on the left bank and 9 0 km on the right bank these drastic changes in the magnitude of piezometric head and the dimension of the influence zone are possibly the reason for the valley width deformation fig s2 in supplementary material beneath the west entrance of the dahewan tunnel see fig 1a the predicted piezometric head increase is about 17 m at this tunnel entrance a valley width measurement line tm7 tm9 was installed which recorded an accumulated deformation of about 1 mm by august 1 2020 this measurement indicates that this location is on the border of the influence zone fig 4 hence justifying the simulation results in this study 4 2 groundwater flow behavior in the unconfined aquifer p2β the groundwater flow behavior in the unconfined basalt p2β aquifer is mainly governed by the fluctuations of pool water level and the seepage control system consisting of grout curtains and numerous drains and less influenced by the rainfall events chen et al 2021 only the near bank zone upstream of the dam site is influenced by reservoir filling and operation and its dimension is much smaller than that of the underlying confined aquifer a detailed description of the flow behavior and a complete comparison between the measurements and the simulations have been given in chen et al 2021 fracture clogging by fine grained sediments plays an important role in permeability variation of the near bank rocks and leads to a continuous decrease of discharge from the drainage systems chen et al 2021 the simulation shows that a dynamically steady state condition can be attained in 2024 which is three years earlier than the confined flow in the limestone aquifer 4 3 water exchange between the two aquifer systems the confined and unconfined flow systems are separated by the low permeability clay shale layer p2βn this aquitard is typically 2 3 m in thickness table 1 and vertical leakage is expected to occur between these two flow systems fig 12 shows the piezometric head difference between the ceiling of the confined limestone aquifer and the floor of the unconfined basalt aquifer indicating that the pore water pressure in the confined aquifer is consistently and remarkably higher than that in the unconfined aquifer the mean of the head difference in the basin was about 125 83 m in april 2022 at the dam site the head difference was about 113 27 150 72 m comparable to the range 131 35 178 60 m of borehole observations before reservoir filling the rate of leakage from the confined aquifer to the unconfined aquifer was about 400 l s which decreased to about 250 l s during the initial impoundment of the reservoir as a result of faster transmission of water pressure in the basalt aquifer fig 13 then the leakage rate increases slightly to a mean of about 300 l s as the pool water level fluctuates and transmits the pressure in the confined aquifer in addition there is a local leakage between these two aquifers in the plunge pool area this local leakage is caused by 28 boreholes drilled during site investigation see fig 2 for their locations which penetrated into the limestone aquifer but were not properly plugged afterwards chen et al 2021 chen et al 2023 the local leakage has been confirmed by groundwater temperature analysis hydrochemical analysis cross correlation analysis and site scale inverse modelling zhou et al 2021 chen et al 2021 chen et al 2023 but this feature is not considered in the basin scale simulation given that the limestone aquifer is confined the unplugged boreholes could be regarded as artesian wells that bring the confined groundwater to the drains at the base of the plunge pool by conceptualizing the unplugged boreholes as one virtual complete well located in the center of the plunge pool we apply the theis formula theis 1935 to further examine the relationship between the local leakage rate and hydraulic head distribution in the confined limestone aquifer 5 s q 4 π t w u where s is the drawdown of groundwater table in a confined aquifer q is the pumping rate i e the leakage rate in this study t kb is the transmissivity of the confined aquifer k is the hydraulic conductivity b is the thickness of the aquifer u is a dimensionless factor and w u is the exponential integral well function given by 6 u s s r 2 4 t t 7 w u u e y y d y where t is the pumping time and s s is the specific storage when the pumping rate q is non constant the transient drawdown of the groundwater table in the confined aquifer at any time tn can be simulated based on the principle of superposition bear 1979 8 s r t n 1 4 π t i 1 n q i q i 1 w s s r 2 4 t t i t i 1 where r is the radial distance away from the pumping well i is the index of time interval and n is the number of time intervals with t 0 0 and q 0 0 given the fact that only a portion α less than 1 of the discharge in the plunge pool area originates from the confined aquifer we use the discharge data and borehole observation data to calibrate α and the hydraulic properties of the aquifer k b and s s with α 47 5 k 1 5 10 6 m s b 280 m and s s 3 5 10 6 m 1 the calibrated values of k b and s s are comparable to the data given in tables 1 and 2 and the value of α is rather close to that obtained by site scale simulation 44 on average chen et al 2023 as shown in fig 14 we map the observation boreholes in the r z plane according to their distances to the center of the plunge pool and compare the calculated and measured groundwater levels at different times with a mean mae of about 12 49 m over all the boreholes the result shows a clear trend of radial flow in the confined aquifer towards the virtual well confirming that the local leakage from the confined aquifer does take place through the unplugged boreholes in the plunge pool area 5 discussion site scale models on a dimension ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters are widely used in the analysis of seepage through dams and or their foundations e g chen et al 2016a chen et al 2016b chen et al 2021 li et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 these models generally work well for safety assessment of dams optimization design of seepage prevention barriers and drainage systems and inverse modelling of local groundwater flow behavior through the dams the application of the site scale models assumes that the groundwater flow caused by reservoir filling and operation mainly occurs on a limited scale in the dam area and that the impact on the groundwater levels in the far field regions is small even for large dams over 200 m high there is less concern on the reservoir operation induced hydrogeological changes on the scale of hus that is much larger than the scale of sites under some particular hydrogeological settings e g when a confined aquifer is present beneath the dam the hydrogeological changes may in turn induce significant abnormal deformation e g dam uplift and valley width contraction that is unexpected in the design phase liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 this study is motivated by the urgent need to assess the hydrogeological changes at the basin scale induced by the filling and operation of the xiluodu reservoir an essential prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of valley width contraction fig s2 in supplementary material the predicted dimension of the influence zone in the confined aquifer system is about 7 9 km from the reservoir which is smaller than the result about 11 km in 2020 predicted by zhang et al 2021 even though the initial predictions in 2014 about 3 9 km are almost the same this difference possibly originates from the much smaller value of s s 5 10 7 m 1 used by zhang et al 2021 obviously this dimension of the influence zone is site dependent and it could even be larger than that of tunneling zheng et al 2021 and coal mining sreekanth et al 2020 that cause regional groundwater drawdown furthermore this study predicts that a dynamically steady state flow condition in the confined aquifer can be reached in 2027 which lies between 2024 and 2028 predicted by regression analysis li et al 2020 and coupled thermo hydro mechanical modelling yin et al 2020 for the convergence time of the valley width contraction at the site respectively this study uses a hierarchical numerical model consisting of a basin scale model and a local site scale model to evaluate groundwater flow behavior in the confined and unconfined aquifer systems and groundwater exchange between them for basin scale and even site scale modelling the continuum approach is usually the primary choice finsterle 2000 oda 1986 xu et al 2015 and hence the accuracy of the simulations depends on how the site conditions are characterized and how the aquifer parameters are determined chen et al 2020b the limited data availability is another issue commonly confronted in regional scale modelling liu et al 2022b person et al 1996 ruybal et al 2019 which may also influence the accuracy of the assessment as a major limitation of this study only the output of the basin scale model is fed into the site scale model to consider the lateral recharge from the basin while the result of the site scale model is not fed back to the basin scale model in fact the groundwater flow behavior at the site scale is controlled by various factors such as the pool water level the seepage prevention and drainage systems and the local leakage along the unplugged boreholes drilled during site investigation in addition to the local geological and hydrogeological settings the local flow behavior may impact to some extent groundwater flow at the basin scale and this issue could be addressed with a coupled basin scale and site scale model in the near future 6 conclusions this study evaluates the basin scale hydrogeological changes induced by reservoir filling and operation at the xiluodu dam site using field observations and hierarchical numerical simulations the yongsheng basin where the dam is situated is identified as an independent hu with complex aquifer aquitard systems a basin scale model 34 km and a site scale model 4 km were created with the former being simulated by modflow and the latter being solved with a finite element code the simulated piezometric head from the basin scale model was applied on the lateral boundaries of the site scale model to approximate the lateral recharge from the basin to the dam site both the changes in groundwater level in the aquifer systems and groundwater exchange between them are evaluated by numerical simulations our results and analysis show that the confined aquifer system is more influenced by the impoundment of the reservoir and that the magnitude of the groundwater level and the dimension of the influence zone grew significantly in the first seven years of operation 2013 2019 at present the increase in groundwater level reaches a maximum equal to the increase in pool water level in the outcrops of the confined aquifer along the valley in the reservoir area and has a magnitude of about 96 m beneath the dam site the dimension of the influence zone with an increase in groundwater level over 10 m is about 7 9 km towards the river banks and the downstream direction the rate of upward vertical leakage from the confined to unconfined aquifer decreased in the first year of filling 2013 and then increases gradually towards a dynamic steady state which is predicted to be attained in 2027 the local vertical leakage occurring in the plunge pool area along the unplugged boreholes drilled during site investigation is quantified and confirmed with calculations based on the theis formula this work helps in understanding the basin scale hydrogeological changes and the resultant valley width deformation induced by reservoir filling and operation but as a major limitation of this study the result of the site scale model is not fed back to the basin scale model and this issue will be addressed with a coupled model in the near future credit authorship contribution statement yi feng chen
