15585,sediment organic matter som is important in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon nutrients and pollutants in the coastal environment which is increasingly disturbed by aquaculture that is particularly intense in china however the identification of aquaculture signals in som is rather challenging in the complex coastal environment that receives materials from a variety of sources this was studied in a typical culture area of shellfish and algae in se china from july 2019 to october 2020 using a combination of elemental oc tn n c isotopic δ13c and δ15n spectral absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence eems parafac and statistical analysis principal component analysis pca all indices of som quantity and several spectral indices for the som composition correlated significantly with grain size with lower som quantity and higher autochthonous contribution in coarse sediments the strong correlations between elemental and spectral indices suggested that optical analysis could provide valuable indices for assessing the quantity of bulk organic matter the comparison of som indices between different zones and between different months showed an overall limited influence of shellfish and laver culture this indicated the sustainability of these types of aquaculture that require no manual addition of feeds and thus are generally clean the further applications of end member mixing analysis using the isosource program and pca were more sensitive which identified the removal of som by shellfish in the growing season and the contribution from shellfish residuals after the harvest and the cultured laver at some locations overall our results have implications for a better understanding of the biogeochemical processes and ecosystem sustainability in the coastal environment under intense aquaculture activities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediment organic matter coastal aquaculture stable isotope fluorescence eems parafac absorption spectroscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the estuaries and continental shelves are hot spots of sedimentation and burial of organic matter which accounts for 80 90 of the carbon burial in the global ocean hedges and keil 1995 bauer et al 2013 the high carbon burial in the coastal environments is related to a series of factors such as the inputs of abundant terrestrial organic matter the high primary productivity and the high sedimentation rate schlunz and schneider 2000 galy et al 2007 therefore the source chemical composition reactivity remineralization and burial of sediment organic matter som in these coastal environments has been an important research topic in the carbon cycle study for several decades hedges 1997 burdige 2007 in addition the nutrients and inorganic organic pollutants are also deposited in sediments after being complexed with organic matter and or adsorbed to inorganic minerals zhang et al 2014 he et al 2016 thus som is also important for determining the speciation migration and fate of pollutants in the coastal areas it is also noteworthy that the carbon nutrients and pollutants bound with within som could be either directly resuspended under the tidal forcing wind and benthic biological disturbance or released to the pore water followed by further diffusion to the upper water column chen and hur 2015 lei et al 2021 overall som is important for both the biogeochemical cycles and the water quality in coastal environments aquaculture is one of the most important human activities in coastal areas which not only provides high quality food for human beings but also can affect aquatic biogeochemistry and ecosystem health the influence is probably most pronounced in china which is the largest aquaculture country that contributes about half of the global aquaculture value cao et al 2015 in particular shellfish is cultured in 60 of the seawater aquaculture area and contributes to 70 of the seawater aquaculture yield in china yu et al 2020 the shellfish culture requires no manual addition of feeds which removes carbon by up taking the aquatic plankton and organic detritus while returning organic matter as fecal and residuals of the dead organisms filgueira et al 2015 sanz lazaro et al 2018 the deposition of biological materials from shellfish could result in the elevated organic inorganic carbon content of sediments and represents a blue carbon sink zhang et al 2017 although this process is partly affected by the resuspension and subsequent dispersion degradation in the dynamic coastal area lei et al 2021 the algae culture is another major type of coastal aquaculture that can be cultured either together with shellfish or in a separate zone month the algae can synthesize large amounts of organic matter with distinct elemental compositions wada et al 2007 cade menun et al 2010 buchholz et al 2016 a part of the cultured algae can be lost by erosion breaking and falling which can be partly deposited in sediments zhang et al 2012 therefore it is critical to assess the effects of shellfish and algae culture on som for a better understanding of the biogeochemical processes and associated carbon sink nutrient cycling and ecosystem sustainability in the coastal environment to understand the influences of coastal aquaculture on som it is important to identify the contribution of the cultured organisms to som the elemental and isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen n c δ13c and δ15n are classical tools for discriminating the contribution from different sources hedges et al 1997 meyers 1997 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 1998 lamb et al 2006 wu et al 2007 wang et al 2020a the values of these indices for typical cultured species e g shellfish and laver have also been reported yokoyama et al 2009 suh and shin 2013 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 kim et al 2020 bianchini et al 2021 however the identification of contribution from the cultured organisms may be rather challenging in the coastal area that receives materials from a variety of terrestrial e g c3 and c4 plants and soils and aquatic sources e g freshwater and marine plankton thus it is worth testing the application of complementary tools for constraining the possible solutions for the contributions of various sources for example the end member mixing analysis using the isosource program may be helpful for this purpose that calculates the range of feasible source contributions to a mixture with an insufficient number of indices derrien et al 2018 phillips and gregg 2003 in addition absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy are increasingly applied to characterize the dissolved particulate and sediment organic matter since they can provide several useful indices for the quantity and quality of organic matter helms et al 2008 stedmon and bro 2008 osburn et al 2012 2015 yang and hur 2014 brym et al 2014 yang et al 2017 qu et al 2021 the use of multiple indices for tracking the source and processing of organic matter can be further aided with the use of statistical analysis such as principal component analysis pca wang et al 2020a b lei et al 2021 however there is little information on the combined use of elemental isotopic spectral indices and pca for assessing the influences of aquaculture on som in the coastal area therefore this study aims to 1 examine the changes in the quantity and quality of som in a typical coastal culture area of shellfish and laver using a combination of elemental isotopic and spectroscopic analysis 2 assess the influences of coastal aquaculture on som and thus the sustainability of aquaculture based on the comparison between different areas and between different months isotopic source analysis and pca the results would be helpful for a better understanding of the biogeochemical processes and ecosystem sustainability in the coastal environment under intense aquaculture activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the lianjiang county se china ranks as the 2nd largest county of fishery products in china over several decades and the aojiang estuary cultural zone in this study is one of the six main cultural zones of the county fig 1 two main shellfish species are seeded around march and harvested in july september i e sinonovacula constricta lamarck sc in the clay beach adjacent to the aojiang river and ruditapes philippinarum rp on the southern sandy beach thereafter the laver is cultured in the rp area until january of the next year the cultivation area of sc and rp is 705 and 525 hectares and the corresponding annual production is 20 667 and 19 200 tons with a mean yield of 2 93 and 3 66 kg m 2 respectively zhou et al 2022 the aojiang river has a watershed area of 2655 km2 and a long term average freshwater discharge of 3 05 billion m3 yr 1 that mainly occurs from march to september zhang et al 2015 fig s1 the local annual precipitation was 1279 and 1109 mm in 2019 and 2020 with 89 occurring during february august in 2019 and during march september in 2020 http www cma gov cn fig s1 the culture area is affected by strong semidiurnal tides average tidal range 4 m lei et al 2021 and the upper sediments are well mixed under the influences of strong tides bioturbation and manual turnover during harvest sediment samples were collected on july 6th 9th and october 16th 22st 2019 and on january 9th 11th and october 22th 2020 the sampling periods in july october and january corresponded to representative seasons of the shellfish growing after the shellfish harvest and during the laver harvest respectively the sampling sites included 23 sites in the rp area r1 23 fig 1 two non culture sites n1 2 and three sites in the sc area s1 3 were also sampled for comparison surface sediments to 2 5 cm depth were collected and stored in frozen 20 c until dried at 60 c for 24 hours for further analysis 2 2 sample measurements and analysis the grain size characteristics were measured on one aliquot of dried sediments using a malvern mastersizer 3000 laser particle size analyzer callesen et al 2018 wang et al 2020b another aliquot of dried sediments was ground to pass an 80 mesh sieve for elemental and isotopic analysis following the method described previously yang et al 2011 wu et al 2013 briefly sediment samples were acidified with hcl to remove inorganic carbon for measuring the content of organic carbon oc and δ13c the content of total nitrogen tn and δ15n were measured for dry sediments without acid treatment the measurements were carried out with a coupled elemental analysis isotopic ratio mass spectrometer thermo delta v advantage the contents of oc and tn were corrected for the sediment weights and the atomic ratio of tn and oc n c was calculated δ13c and δ15n were calculated relative to the values of standard material i e pdb for δ13c and n2 in the air for δ15n the source of som was assessed with the end member mixing analysis based on δ13c and δ15n using the isosource software version 1 3 1 phillips and gregg 2003 derrien et al 2018 in the isosource analysis the range of feasible source contributions to a mixture is calculated which is helpful when too many sources are present and it is impossible to determine a unique solution an aliquot of dried sediments was base extracted for absorption and fluorescence analysis of som following the procedures described previously osburn et al 2012 wang et al 2020a b lei et al 2021 briefly the dried sediments were extracted with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solution for 24 hours neutralized with 1 mol l 1 hcl solution final ph 7 5 0 3 and filtered through 0 2 μm polycarbonate filters the alkaline extraction was carried out in dark at 4 c to minimize the photo and microbial degradation of organic matter it is reported that the extraction efficiency of this method is about 38 and is not dependent on the salinity or the season brym et al 2014 absorption spectra of the filtrates were scanned over 240 800 nm using a shimadzu uv 1780 uv vis spectrometer and were baseline corrected by subtracting the mean absorbance over 700 800 nm the absorption coefficient at 300 nm a 300 was used as an index for the level of colored organic matter in the sediments which was corrected for the solution volumes and sediment weights the absorption slope over 275 295 nm s 275 295 was also calculated from the spectra which correlated negatively with the aromaticity and average molecular weight of organic matter helms et al 2008 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were scanned for the filtrates over the excitation wavelength ex of 240 450 nm and the emission wavelength em of 280 600 nm using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer wang et al 2020a b lei et al 2021 each measured eem was corrected for the inner filter effect based on the absorption spectra measured for the same sample kothawala et al 2013 and subtracted the blank signals of milli q water then the corrected eems were modeled with parallel factor analysis parafac in matlab 7 0 using the domfluor toolbox 1 7 stedmon and bro 2008 yang et al 2017 the number of parafac components was determined based on the split half validation the fluorescence intensity f max of each component was used to represent its level which was corrected for the solution volume and sediment weight the contribution of each component to the total fluorescence c1 c5 was used as indices for the composition of som humification index hix and biological index bix were also calculated as indices for the humic content and source of organic matter respectively zsolnay et al 1999 huguet et al 2009 hix was the ratio of fluorescence over em 434 480 nm to that over 300 346 nm at ex 255 nm and bix was the ratio of fluorescence at em 380 nm to that at 430 nm at ex 310 nm all absorption and fluorescence measurements were performed in duplicate and the mean analytical precision was within 5 for all indices except for one parafac component c4 7 4 the pearson correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and independent samples t test were carried out in spss statistics 22 3 results 3 1 grain size and the elemental and isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen the median grain size dx 50 was 5 8 388 μm for the sediments of this study fig 2 a table s1 the dx 50 correlated negatively with the percents of clay 4 μm r 0 905 and silt 4 63 μm r 0 938 but correlated positively with the sandy fraction 63 μm r 0 948 table 1 the dx 50 was low 7 2 12 8 μm for the non culture sites n1 n2 and the sc area s1 s3 which were dominated by fine sediments silt 55 75 clay 18 33 the dx 50 was higher for most rp culture sites 146 388 μm that contained mainly coarse sediments sand 70 98 except for sites r4 r8 r13 r20 and r21 5 8 9 9 μm containing mainly silts 56 79 and clay 20 41 the percentages of oc and tn in sediments were 0 036 1 37

the spectra of the n2 station which showed a notable shoulder peak at 275 nm fig s2 a 300 ranged from 0 17 m 1 g 1 at r5 to 101 m 1 g 1 at n2 fig 3 a which correlated strongly with oc and tn r 0 952 0

fluorescent components were identified using eems parafac for the som in this study c1 c5 which were validated by the split half validation fig s3 and were similar to those in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 component c1 displayed two ex maxima 250 and 360 nm and one em maximum 452 nm it was similar to a terrestrial humic like component identified previously in soils and suspended particles c1 in sharma et al 2017 c1 in lei et al 2021 component c2 showed ex em maxima at 240 310 412 nm resembling a microbial humic like component c3 in osburn et al 2012 c1 in wu et al 2021 component c3 had ex em maxima at 250 518 nm similar to another terrestrial humic like component at the longest emission wavelength c2 in brym et al 2014 c1 in osburn et al 2015 component c4 had ex em maxima at 240 315 395 nm resembling the microbial humic like component c2 in hambly et al 2015 c3 in wang et al 2020a component c5 had ex em maxima at 275 325 nm covering the fluorescence regions of tryptophan like and tyrosine like components c3 in derrien et al 2020a c4 in kida et al 2021 the f max of c1 c5 were 0 02 0 85 0 1 78 0 1 08 0 0 21 and 0 01 0 63 ru g 1 with average values of 0 13 0

c4 r 0 813 to 0 982 p 0 01 table 2 c2 and c3 correlated negatively while c1 and c4 correlated positively with dx 50 sand and s275 295 hix and bix were 4 0 11 1 and 0 51 1 31 with average values of 6 6

correlated negatively with dx 50 sand s 275 295 c1 c4 and c5 r 0 416 to 0 939 p 0 05 in contrast bix correlated negatively with clay silt c2 and c3 r 0 732 to 0 938 p 0 01 but correlated positively with dx 50 sand s 275 295 c1 c4 and c5 r 0 440 0 954 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 changes in the quantity of som and the effects of grain size the oc tn a 300 and total fluorescence of c1 c5 changed by 38 99 604 and 72 folds in this study indicating notable variations in the som quantity figs 2b 3a b generally oc tn a 300 and the fluorescence were high for the silty sediments from non culture sites n1 n2 and the sc area s1 s3 adjacent to the aojiang river these dom quantity indices were generally lower for most sandy sediments in the rp culture sites that were farther from the river except for elevated values for the silty sediments at some stations of the rp area r4 r8 r13 r20 and r21 all som quantity indices showed no significant seasonal variation except for a higher tn for the sandy rp area in july 2019 than in october 2019 and january 2020 table s2 these results indicated that the som quantity was largely dependent on the grain size as discussed below while the seasonal variation plays a secondary role most of the som quantity indices correlated strongly with each other r 0 913 0 994 p 0 01 except for c4 which correlated moderately with other indices including oc tn a 300 c1 c3 and c5 r 0 557 0 731 p 0 01 table 1 this indicated that most som quantity indices had similar changing patterns and were probably related to similar controlling factors such as the grain size as discussed below in particular the strong correlations between elemental and optical indices measured with different pre treatments and instruments suggested the feasibility of absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy for assessing the quantity of bulk som table 1 fig 4 a b in addition the tn and protein like c5 which correlated strongly with each other both correlated positively with silt and correlated negatively with dx 50 and sand table 1 this indicated that more n containing compounds were associated with the fine sediments however the δ15n which was different for terrestrial and marine organic matter did not correlate significantly with any grain size index table 2 this suggested no strong partitioning of different types of n between silty and sandy sediments which is an interesting topic for future studies all som quantity indices correlated negatively with dx 50 and sand and correlated positively with clay and silt table 1 fig 4c d the som quantity indices were all higher for the silty sediments than for the sandy sediments table s1 although the difference was more significant for oc and c1 c3 independent samples t test p 0 05 than for tn a 300 and c4 c5 that had large within group variances table s2 these results suggested that the changes in som quantity were largely dependent on the grain size of sediments due to the higher surface area and adsorption sites of fine sediments than coarse sediments hedges 1997 burdige 2007 wu et al 2013 the quantity of som might be further affected by the degradation processes that were probably different between the silty and sandy sediments due to changes in the oxygen content burdige 2007 derrien et al 2020b and microbial community zhou et al 2022 in the coastal cultural area of this study silty sediments are deposited adjacent to the aojiang river while the farther and more open southern zone is dominated by sandy sediments except for a few stations therefore the grain size distribution under hydrodynamic sorting from diverse forces e g river discharge tides and waves was important in determining the som quantity in the coastal aquaculture area 4 2 effects of grain size on the quality of som the spectral indices for the som quality s 275 295 c1 c5 hix and bix also showed notable variation in this study fig 3 on one hand the spatial variation of som quality was also affected by the grain size distribution the s 275 295 c1 c4 and bix were lower in the silty sediments than in the sandy sediments while c2 and c3 were higher in the silty sediments table s2 on the other hand the s 275 295 c1 and c5 were higher while c3 and hix were lower in the sandy sediments of the rp area in january 2020 than in other months table s2 this indicated lower molecular weight and humic content but a higher protein like fraction in winter which might result from decreased terrestrial inputs at lower precipitation river discharge in the dry season fig s1 and or the contribution of organic matter from the laver that was cultured after the harvest of shellfish and or the freshwater marine plankton production the s 275 295 c1 c5 hix and bix correlated significantly with grain size indices table 2 higher s 275 295 hix and bix are related to lower average molecular weight aromaticity higher humic content and higher biological aquatic bacterial contribution respectively helms et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 therefore the correlations in this study indicated that the coarse sediments contained a higher fraction of biological organic matter with lower molecular weight aromaticity and humic content in contrast fine sediments were associated with more terrestrial high molecular weight aromatic and humified organic matter in addition the correlation analysis indicated that coarse sediments were related to higher c1 and c4 while fine sediments had higher c2 and c3 this suggested that the relative distribution of parafac components was also partly affected by the grain size overall the spectral results supported the importance of changing grain size in different areas e g sc silty and rp sandy cultural areas for the chemical composition of som the variability of som quality was probably due to different sources under hydrodynamic sorting and different degradation under variable oxygen contents and microbial community hedges 1997 burdige 2007 wu et al 2013 derrien et al 2020b zhou et al 2022 for example the higher terrestrial contribution in the fine sediments was partly supported by the more depleted δ13c values for the silty sediments of s2 3 fig 2c a recent study in the same study area revealed a higher abundance of bacteria and archaea in the silty sc area zhou et al 2022 which might indicate more microbial transformation and thus contribute to the higher humic content 4 3 effects of coastal aquaculture on som an overall assessment with spectral indices the comparison of som indices between non cultural rp and sc cultural areas showed an overall no significant difference for all indices independent samples t test p 0 05 table s2 there was also no significant difference for most som quantity indices oc a 300 and c1 c5 between different months in the rp areas table s2 these results indicated that the shellfish and laver aquaculture did not cause notable over consumption or heavy pollution and was generally sustainable on one hand the absence of over consumption suggested that the aquaculture intensity was in the suitable range the long term aquaculture activity in this area indicated the generally adequate inputs of abundant substrates from terrestrial and marine sources at the dynamic land ocean interface on the other hand the absence of heavy pollution was probably caused by the fact that the culture of shellfish and laver required no manual addition of feeds filgueira et al 2015 sanz lazaro et al 2018 it is noteworthy that the comparison was in part limited by the number of samples and the large within group variance for example the som quantity indices oc tn a 300 and total fluorescence of c1 c5 were all higher in the silty sediments of the rp area r8 and r13 than in the adjacent non cultural silty site n1 in oct 2019 indicating the potential contribution from the residual dead rp organisms after the harvest figs 2b 3a b however these indices at r8 and r13 were lower than the non cultural site n2 that was farther making the comparison between non cultural and rp cultural silty sediments not significant similarly the sc silty sites s1 s3 also had higher som quantity indices than the rp silty sites r20 r21 in october 2020 figs 2b 3a b table s1 although the difference was not significant in the t test table s2 the sc area was closer to the river mouth and was separated into several pieces with manually inserted plants miscanthus as the border therefore the more abundant som in the sc silty sites might result from more fluvial inputs additions from the falling of inserted plants and or less leaching flushing by tides waves 4 4 effects of coastal aquaculture on som insights from isotopic indices the elemental and isotopic composition of c and n n c δ13c and δ15n are popular indices for tracking the source of organic matter in aquatic environments they did not correlate significantly with any grain size index in this study and were compared with those for typical organic matter sources in the literature hedges et al 1997 meyers 1997 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 1998 lamb et al 2006 wu et al 2007 yokoyama et al 2009 suh and shin 2013 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 kim et al 2020 bianchini et al 2021 fig 5 the potential sources of som in the study area were very diverse including terrestrial c3 and c4 plants soil marine and river plankton and the cultured organisms in different areas and different months rp sc and laver it was difficult to obtain a unique solution for the contribution of each source in such a complex environment thus the range of feasible solutions and major features from the end member mixing analysis based on δ13c and δ15n using the isosource program were discussed below fig s4 the n c ratio was used for only qualitative analysis and was not included in the quantitative isosource analysis to avoid potential bias such as the preferential microbial degradation of n rich amino acids hood et al 2009 zhuang et al 2021 in contrast the stable isotopic ratios and humic components indices e g c1 c3 and hix are more stable for tracking the source of organic matter in the early diagenesis derrien et al 2020b the number of feasible solutions ranged from 88 for n2 5 sources to 2062896 for r14 up to 7 sources in particular the som at n2 showed the highest values of n c δ13c and δ15n which indicated a dominant source of marine plankton with a feasible contribution of 71 79 this was consistent with the presence of a notable shoulder peak around 280 nm in the absorption spectra of n2 which was related to the autochthonous production brym et al 2014 wang et al 2020b lei et al 2021 the isosource analysis based on the stable isotopic values for different sites at different months could provide useful information for constraining the feasible contribution from cultured organisms generally the feasible contribution of sc was low for s3 7 which was characterized by the lowest δ13c 26 59 with the main source of terrestrial c3 plants 72 93 hedges et al 1997 meyers 1997 lamb et al 2006 wu et al 2007 the feasible contribution of sc showed broader ranges for s1 2 0 42 and 0 32 which had higher δ13c and δ15n values 23 20 to 24 89 and 4 00 3 65 than s3 previous studies have shown higher δ13c and δ15n values for sc about 20 and 9 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 than terrestrial c3 plants the feasible contribution of rp and laver were both low for r10 and 17 5 which had low δ15n 0 75 0 82 but median values of δ13c 22 71 to 23 93 that corresponded to prevailing sources of mixed terrestrial c3 and c4 plants hedges et al 1997 meyers 1997 lamb et al 2006 wu et al 2007 however the feasible contribution of rp showed larger ranges from 0 to 18 for other sites in the rp area the laver also showed broader ranges of the feasible contribution for r14 16 and 18 in january from 0 to 30 the rp and laver also have higher δ13c about 19 and 22 5 and δ15n values about 10 and 7 5 yokoyama et al 2009 suh and shin 2013 kim et al 2020 bianchini et al 2021 than terrestrial c3 plants overall the notable changes in the elemental and isotopic composition demonstrated significant variability of diverse som sources in the coastal aquaculture area the end member mixing analysis using the isosource program could provide a useful tool for constraining the range of feasible contributions from terrestrial sources plankton and cultured organisms thus the stable isotopic ratios and isosource analysis could provide information for understanding the som source and variability under the influences of coastal aquaculture although the unique solution could not be obtained with these techniques due to the mixing of too many sources in complex environments 4 5 effects of coastal aquaculture on som assessed with pca pca was further applied for investigating the som variations and the influences of aquaculture in this study fig 6 the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 41 5 and 34 5 of the total variance respectively pc1 correlated strongly with oc tn a 300 and c1 c5 r 0 729 0 952 indicating pc1 mainly represented the som quantity pc2 correlated positively with s 275 295 bix c1 c4 c5 and dx 50 r 0 640 0 876 but correlated negatively with hix c2 and c3 r 0 864 to 0 964 this suggested that higher pc2 was related to the autochthonous sources with lower molecular weight and humic content that were associated with coarse sediments the pc1 score was highest for n2 followed by s1 and r13 indicating elevated som quantity in these silty sediments fig 6b pc2 was low for most silty sediments suggesting generally low autochthonous constituents and more terrestrial organic matter in fine sediments of both sc and rp areas pc2 was higher for most sandy sediments of the rp area indicating increased autochthonous contribution in the more open area fig 6c in particular the bivalves were cultured from spring to autumn in the study area the low pc1 for both the silty and sandy sediments in july 2019 r1 6 indicated potential removals of som by shellfish filgueira et al 2015 sanz lazaro et al 2018 the large variation of pc2 in july further indicated the variability of som source and composition across different sites the pc1 was also low for most sites in october 2019 and 2020 after the bivalves were harvested however pc1 showed higher values for r13 and s1 that might be in part caused by the contribution from the residues of dead shellfish the residues of dead shellfish could be seen in the field investigation fig s5a this was consistent with the elevated upper limit for the feasible contribution of rp at r13 0 44 and sc at s1 0 42 based on the isosource analysis fig s4 the som of the rp area in january 2020 generally had higher pc1 than the sandy sediments in other months indicating elevated som quantity fig 6c the terrestrial input was likely weak in the dry season as indicated by the high pc2 and the t test results table s2 section 4 2 thus the increased som in this month might indicate higher contributions from the freshwater marine plankton and the laver that was cultured after the harvest of shellfish fig s5b and the isosource analysis suggested a high upper limit for the feasible contribution of laver at r14 16 and 18 from 0 to 30 fig s4 5 conclusions the quantity and quality of som changed greatly in the coastal aquaculture area which was largely dependent on the grain size and the related distribution of different sediments under hydrodynamic sorting overall the coarse sediments contained significantly less organic matter and had higher fractions of autochthonous organic matter with lower molecular weight aromaticity and humic content the optical indices for the som quantity correlated strongly with oc and tn indicating similar changing patterns and underlying controlling factors this suggested that absorption and fluorescent eems parafac could provide valuable indices for estimating the content of bulk organic matter in sediments the comparison of som indices with independent samples t test between different zones and between different months showed an overall limited influence of shellfish and laver culture this supported the sustainability of these types of aquaculture that require no manual addition of feeds and are supported by substrates from terrestrial and marine sources the further applications of end member mixing analysis using the isosource program and pca were sensitive for detecting the influences of coastal aquaculture the removal of som by shellfish in the growing season and the contribution from shellfish residuals after the harvest and the cultured laver were identified at some locations in particular the stable isotopic ratios and the humic components indices e g c1 c3 and hix provided useful indices for detecting the signature of aquaculture on som since they have been found to be more stable for tracking the source of organic matter in the early diagenesis

15585,sediment organic matter som is important in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon nutrients and pollutants in the coastal environment which is increasingly disturbed by aquaculture that is particularly intense in china however the identification of aquaculture signals in som is rather challenging in the complex coastal environment that receives materials from a variety of sources this was studied in a typical culture area of shellfish and algae in se china from july 2019 to october 2020 using a combination of elemental oc tn n c isotopic δ13c and δ15n spectral absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence eems parafac and statistical analysis principal component analysis pca all indices of som quantity and several spectral indices for the som composition correlated significantly with grain size with lower som quantity and higher autochthonous contribution in coarse sediments the strong correlations between elemental and spectral indices suggested that optical analysis could provide valuable indices for assessing the quantity of bulk organic matter the comparison of som indices between different zones and between different months showed an overall limited influence of shellfish and laver culture this indicated the sustainability of these types of aquaculture that require no manual addition of feeds and thus are generally clean the further applications of end member mixing analysis using the isosource program and pca were more sensitive which identified the removal of som by shellfish in the growing season and the contribution from shellfish residuals after the harvest and the cultured laver at some locations overall our results have implications for a better understanding of the biogeochemical processes and ecosystem sustainability in the coastal environment under intense aquaculture activities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediment organic matter coastal aquaculture stable isotope fluorescence eems parafac absorption spectroscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the estuaries and continental shelves are hot spots of sedimentation and burial of organic matter which accounts for 80 90 of the carbon burial in the global ocean hedges and keil 1995 bauer et al 2013 the high carbon burial in the coastal environments is related to a series of factors such as the inputs of abundant terrestrial organic matter the high primary productivity and the high sedimentation rate schlunz and schneider 2000 galy et al 2007 therefore the source chemical composition reactivity remineralization and burial of sediment organic matter som in these coastal environments has been an important research topic in the carbon cycle study for several decades hedges 1997 burdige 2007 in addition the nutrients and inorganic organic pollutants are also deposited in sediments after being complexed with organic matter and or adsorbed to inorganic minerals zhang et al 2014 he et al 2016 thus som is also important for determining the speciation migration and fate of pollutants in the coastal areas it is also noteworthy that the carbon nutrients and pollutants bound with within som could be either directly resuspended under the tidal forcing wind and benthic biological disturbance or released to the pore water followed by further diffusion to the upper water column chen and hur 2015 lei et al 2021 overall som is important for both the biogeochemical cycles and the water quality in coastal environments aquaculture is one of the most important human activities in coastal areas which not only provides high quality food for human beings but also can affect aquatic biogeochemistry and ecosystem health the influence is probably most pronounced in china which is the largest aquaculture country that contributes about half of the global aquaculture value cao et al 2015 in particular shellfish is cultured in 60 of the seawater aquaculture area and contributes to 70 of the seawater aquaculture yield in china yu et al 2020 the shellfish culture requires no manual addition of feeds which removes carbon by up taking the aquatic plankton and organic detritus while returning organic matter as fecal and residuals of the dead organisms filgueira et al 2015 sanz lazaro et al 2018 the deposition of biological materials from shellfish could result in the elevated organic inorganic carbon content of sediments and represents a blue carbon sink zhang et al 2017 although this process is partly affected by the resuspension and subsequent dispersion degradation in the dynamic coastal area lei et al 2021 the algae culture is another major type of coastal aquaculture that can be cultured either together with shellfish or in a separate zone month the algae can synthesize large amounts of organic matter with distinct elemental compositions wada et al 2007 cade menun et al 2010 buchholz et al 2016 a part of the cultured algae can be lost by erosion breaking and falling which can be partly deposited in sediments zhang et al 2012 therefore it is critical to assess the effects of shellfish and algae culture on som for a better understanding of the biogeochemical processes and associated carbon sink nutrient cycling and ecosystem sustainability in the coastal environment to understand the influences of coastal aquaculture on som it is important to identify the contribution of the cultured organisms to som the elemental and isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen n c δ13c and δ15n are classical tools for discriminating the contribution from different sources hedges et al 1997 meyers 1997 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 1998 lamb et al 2006 wu et al 2007 wang et al 2020a the values of these indices for typical cultured species e g shellfish and laver have also been reported yokoyama et al 2009 suh and shin 2013 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 kim et al 2020 bianchini et al 2021 however the identification of contribution from the cultured organisms may be rather challenging in the coastal area that receives materials from a variety of terrestrial e g c3 and c4 plants and soils and aquatic sources e g freshwater and marine plankton thus it is worth testing the application of complementary tools for constraining the possible solutions for the contributions of various sources for example the end member mixing analysis using the isosource program may be helpful for this purpose that calculates the range of feasible source contributions to a mixture with an insufficient number of indices derrien et al 2018 phillips and gregg 2003 in addition absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy are increasingly applied to characterize the dissolved particulate and sediment organic matter since they can provide several useful indices for the quantity and quality of organic matter helms et al 2008 stedmon and bro 2008 osburn et al 2012 2015 yang and hur 2014 brym et al 2014 yang et al 2017 qu et al 2021 the use of multiple indices for tracking the source and processing of organic matter can be further aided with the use of statistical analysis such as principal component analysis pca wang et al 2020a b lei et al 2021 however there is little information on the combined use of elemental isotopic spectral indices and pca for assessing the influences of aquaculture on som in the coastal area therefore this study aims to 1 examine the changes in the quantity and quality of som in a typical coastal culture area of shellfish and laver using a combination of elemental isotopic and spectroscopic analysis 2 assess the influences of coastal aquaculture on som and thus the sustainability of aquaculture based on the comparison between different areas and between different months isotopic source analysis and pca the results would be helpful for a better understanding of the biogeochemical processes and ecosystem sustainability in the coastal environment under intense aquaculture activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the lianjiang county se china ranks as the 2nd largest county of fishery products in china over several decades and the aojiang estuary cultural zone in this study is one of the six main cultural zones of the county fig 1 two main shellfish species are seeded around march and harvested in july september i e sinonovacula constricta lamarck sc in the clay beach adjacent to the aojiang river and ruditapes philippinarum rp on the southern sandy beach thereafter the laver is cultured in the rp area until january of the next year the cultivation area of sc and rp is 705 and 525 hectares and the corresponding annual production is 20 667 and 19 200 tons with a mean yield of 2 93 and 3 66 kg m 2 respectively zhou et al 2022 the aojiang river has a watershed area of 2655 km2 and a long term average freshwater discharge of 3 05 billion m3 yr 1 that mainly occurs from march to september zhang et al 2015 fig s1 the local annual precipitation was 1279 and 1109 mm in 2019 and 2020 with 89 occurring during february august in 2019 and during march september in 2020 http www cma gov cn fig s1 the culture area is affected by strong semidiurnal tides average tidal range 4 m lei et al 2021 and the upper sediments are well mixed under the influences of strong tides bioturbation and manual turnover during harvest sediment samples were collected on july 6th 9th and october 16th 22st 2019 and on january 9th 11th and october 22th 2020 the sampling periods in july october and january corresponded to representative seasons of the shellfish growing after the shellfish harvest and during the laver harvest respectively the sampling sites included 23 sites in the rp area r1 23 fig 1 two non culture sites n1 2 and three sites in the sc area s1 3 were also sampled for comparison surface sediments to 2 5 cm depth were collected and stored in frozen 20 c until dried at 60 c for 24 hours for further analysis 2 2 sample measurements and analysis the grain size characteristics were measured on one aliquot of dried sediments using a malvern mastersizer 3000 laser particle size analyzer callesen et al 2018 wang et al 2020b another aliquot of dried sediments was ground to pass an 80 mesh sieve for elemental and isotopic analysis following the method described previously yang et al 2011 wu et al 2013 briefly sediment samples were acidified with hcl to remove inorganic carbon for measuring the content of organic carbon oc and δ13c the content of total nitrogen tn and δ15n were measured for dry sediments without acid treatment the measurements were carried out with a coupled elemental analysis isotopic ratio mass spectrometer thermo delta v advantage the contents of oc and tn were corrected for the sediment weights and the atomic ratio of tn and oc n c was calculated δ13c and δ15n were calculated relative to the values of standard material i e pdb for δ13c and n2 in the air for δ15n the source of som was assessed with the end member mixing analysis based on δ13c and δ15n using the isosource software version 1 3 1 phillips and gregg 2003 derrien et al 2018 in the isosource analysis the range of feasible source contributions to a mixture is calculated which is helpful when too many sources are present and it is impossible to determine a unique solution an aliquot of dried sediments was base extracted for absorption and fluorescence analysis of som following the procedures described previously osburn et al 2012 wang et al 2020a b lei et al 2021 briefly the dried sediments were extracted with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solution for 24 hours neutralized with 1 mol l 1 hcl solution final ph 7 5 0 3 and filtered through 0 2 μm polycarbonate filters the alkaline extraction was carried out in dark at 4 c to minimize the photo and microbial degradation of organic matter it is reported that the extraction efficiency of this method is about 38 and is not dependent on the salinity or the season brym et al 2014 absorption spectra of the filtrates were scanned over 240 800 nm using a shimadzu uv 1780 uv vis spectrometer and were baseline corrected by subtracting the mean absorbance over 700 800 nm the absorption coefficient at 300 nm a 300 was used as an index for the level of colored organic matter in the sediments which was corrected for the solution volumes and sediment weights the absorption slope over 275 295 nm s 275 295 was also calculated from the spectra which correlated negatively with the aromaticity and average molecular weight of organic matter helms et al 2008 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were scanned for the filtrates over the excitation wavelength ex of 240 450 nm and the emission wavelength em of 280 600 nm using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer wang et al 2020a b lei et al 2021 each measured eem was corrected for the inner filter effect based on the absorption spectra measured for the same sample kothawala et al 2013 and subtracted the blank signals of milli q water then the corrected eems were modeled with parallel factor analysis parafac in matlab 7 0 using the domfluor toolbox 1 7 stedmon and bro 2008 yang et al 2017 the number of parafac components was determined based on the split half validation the fluorescence intensity f max of each component was used to represent its level which was corrected for the solution volume and sediment weight the contribution of each component to the total fluorescence c1 c5 was used as indices for the composition of som humification index hix and biological index bix were also calculated as indices for the humic content and source of organic matter respectively zsolnay et al 1999 huguet et al 2009 hix was the ratio of fluorescence over em 434 480 nm to that over 300 346 nm at ex 255 nm and bix was the ratio of fluorescence at em 380 nm to that at 430 nm at ex 310 nm all absorption and fluorescence measurements were performed in duplicate and the mean analytical precision was within 5 for all indices except for one parafac component c4 7 4 the pearson correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and independent samples t test were carried out in spss statistics 22 3 results 3 1 grain size and the elemental and isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen the median grain size dx 50 was 5 8 388 μm for the sediments of this study fig 2 a table s1 the dx 50 correlated negatively with the percents of clay 4 μm r 0 905 and silt 4 63 μm r 0 938 but correlated positively with the sandy fraction 63 μm r 0 948 table 1 the dx 50

fluorescent components were identified using eems parafac for the som in this study c1 c5 which were validated by the split half validation fig s3 and were similar to those in the openfluor database

99 604 and 72 folds in this study indicating notable variations in the som quantity figs 2b 3a b generally oc tn a 300 and the fluorescence were high for the silty sediments from non culture sites n1 n2 and the sc area s1 s3 adjacent to the aojiang river these dom quantity indices were generally lower for most sandy sediments in the rp culture sites that were farther from the river except for elevated values for the silty sediments at some stations of the rp area r4 r8 r13 r20 and r21 all som quantity indices showed no significant seasonal variation except for a higher tn for the sandy rp area in july 2019 than in october 2019 and january 2020 table s2 these results indicated that the som quantity was largely dependent on the grain size as discussed below while the seasonal variation plays a secondary role most of the som quantity indices correlated strongly with each other r 0 913 0 994 p 0 01 except for c4 which correlated moderately with other indices including oc tn a 300 c1 c3 and c5 r 0 557 0 731 p 0 01 table 1 this indicated that most som quantity indices had similar changing patterns and were probably related to similar controlling factors such as the grain size as discussed below in particular the strong correlations between elemental and optical indices measured with different pre treatments and instruments suggested the feasibility of absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy for assessing the quantity of bulk som table 1 fig 4 a b in addition the tn and protein like c5 which correlated strongly with each other both correlated positively with silt and correlated negatively with dx 50 and sand table 1 this indicated that more n containing compounds were associated with the fine sediments however the δ15n which was different for terrestrial and marine organic matter did not correlate significantly with any grain size index table 2 this suggested no strong partitioning of different types of n between silty and sandy sediments which is an interesting topic for future studies all som quantity indices correlated negatively with dx 50 and sand and correlated positively with clay and silt table 1 fig 4c d the som quantity indices were all higher for the silty sediments than for the sandy sediments table s1 although the difference was more significant for oc and c1 c3 independent samples t test p 0 05 than for tn a 300 and c4 c5 that had large within group variances table s2 these results suggested that the changes in som quantity were largely dependent on the grain size of sediments due to the higher surface area and adsorption sites of fine sediments than coarse sediments hedges 1997 burdige 2007 wu et al 2013 the quantity of som might be further affected by the degradation processes that were probably different between the silty and sandy sediments due to changes in the oxygen content burdige 2007 derrien et al 2020b and microbial community zhou et al 2022 in the coastal cultural area of this study silty sediments are deposited adjacent to the aojiang river while the farther and more open southern zone is dominated by sandy sediments except for a few stations therefore the grain size distribution under hydrodynamic sorting from diverse forces e g river discharge tides and waves was important in determining the som quantity in the coastal aquaculture area 4 2 effects of grain size on the quality of som the spectral indices for the som quality s 275 295 c1 c5 hix and bix also showed notable variation in this study fig 3 on one hand the spatial variation of som quality was also affected by the grain size distribution the s 275 295 c1 c4 and bix were lower in the silty sediments than in the sandy sediments while c2 and c3 were higher in the silty sediments table s2 on the other hand the s 275 295 c1 and c5 were higher while c3 and hix were lower in the sandy sediments of the rp area in january 2020 than in other months table s2 this indicated lower molecular weight and humic content but a higher protein like fraction in winter which might result from decreased terrestrial inputs at lower precipitation river discharge in the dry season fig s1 and or the contribution of organic matter from the laver that was cultured after the harvest of shellfish and or the freshwater marine plankton production the s 275 295 c1 c5 hix and bix correlated significantly with grain size indices table 2 higher s 275 295 hix and bix are related to lower average molecular weight aromaticity higher humic content and higher biological aquatic bacterial contribution respectively helms et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 therefore the correlations in this study indicated that the coarse sediments contained a higher fraction of biological organic matter with lower molecular weight aromaticity and humic content in contrast fine sediments were associated with more terrestrial high molecular weight aromatic and humified organic matter in addition the correlation analysis indicated that coarse sediments were related to higher c1 and c4 while fine sediments had higher c2 and c3 this suggested that the relative distribution of parafac components was also partly affected by the grain size overall the spectral results supported the importance of changing grain size in different areas e g sc silty and rp sandy cultural areas for the chemical composition of som the variability of som quality was probably due to different sources under hydrodynamic sorting and different degradation under variable oxygen contents and microbial community hedges 1997 burdige 2007 wu et al 2013 derrien et al 2020b zhou et al 2022 for example the higher terrestrial contribution in the fine sediments was partly supported by the more depleted δ13c values for the silty sediments of s2 3 fig 2c a recent study in the same study area revealed a higher abundance of bacteria and archaea in the silty sc area zhou et al 2022 which might indicate more microbial transformation and thus contribute to the higher humic content 4 3 effects of coastal aquaculture on som an overall assessment with spectral indices the comparison of som indices between non cultural rp and sc cultural areas showed an overall no significant difference for all indices independent samples t test p 0 05 table s2 there was also no significant difference for most som quantity indices oc a 300 and c1 c5 between different months in the rp areas table s2 these results indicated that the shellfish and laver aquaculture did not cause notable over consumption or heavy pollution and was generally sustainable on one hand the absence of over consumption suggested that the aquaculture intensity was in the suitable range the long term aquaculture activity in this area indicated the generally adequate inputs of abundant substrates from terrestrial and marine sources at the dynamic land ocean interface on the other hand the absence of heavy pollution was probably caused by the fact that the culture of shellfish and laver required no manual addition of feeds filgueira et al 2015 sanz lazaro et al 2018 it is noteworthy that the comparison was in part limited by the number of samples and the large within group variance for example the som quantity indices oc tn a 300 and total fluorescence of c1 c5 were all higher in the silty sediments of the rp area r8 and r13 than in the adjacent non cultural silty site n1 in oct 2019 indicating the potential contribution from the residual dead rp organisms after the harvest figs 2b 3a b however these indices at r8 and r13 were lower than the non cultural site n2 that was farther making the comparison between non cultural and rp cultural silty sediments not significant similarly the sc silty sites s1 s3 also had higher som quantity indices than the rp silty sites r20 r21 in october 2020 figs 2b 3a b table s1 although the difference was not significant in the t test table s2 the sc area was closer to the river mouth and was separated into several pieces with manually inserted plants miscanthus as the border therefore the more abundant som in the sc silty sites might result from more fluvial inputs additions from the falling of inserted plants and or less leaching flushing by tides waves 4 4 effects of coastal aquaculture on som insights from isotopic indices the elemental and isotopic composition of c and n n c δ13c and δ15n are popular indices for tracking the source of organic matter in aquatic environments they did not correlate significantly with any grain size index in this study and were compared with those for typical organic matter sources in the literature hedges et al 1997 meyers 1997 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 1998 lamb et al 2006 wu et al 2007 yokoyama et al 2009 suh and shin 2013 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 kim et al 2020 bianchini et al 2021 fig 5 the potential sources of som in the study area were very diverse including terrestrial c3 and c4 plants soil marine and river plankton and the cultured organisms in different areas and different months rp sc and laver it was difficult to obtain a unique solution for the contribution of each source in such a complex environment thus the range of feasible solutions and major features from the end member mixing analysis based on δ13c and δ15n using the isosource program were discussed below fig s4 the n c ratio was used for only qualitative analysis and was not included in the quantitative isosource analysis to avoid potential bias such as the preferential microbial degradation of n rich amino acids hood et al 2009 zhuang et al 2021 in contrast the stable isotopic ratios and humic components indices e g c1 c3 and hix are more stable for tracking the source of organic matter in the early diagenesis derrien et al 2020b the number of feasible solutions ranged from 88 for n2 5 sources to 2062896 for r14 up to 7 sources in particular the som at n2 showed the highest values of n c δ13c and δ15n which indicated a dominant source of marine plankton with a feasible contribution of 71 79 this was consistent with the presence of a notable shoulder peak around 280 nm in the absorption spectra of n2 which was related to the autochthonous production brym et al 2014 wang et al 2020b lei et al 2021 the isosource analysis based on the stable isotopic values for different sites at different months could provide useful information for constraining the feasible contribution from cultured organisms generally the feasible contribution of sc was low for s3 7 which was characterized by the lowest δ13c 26 59 with the main source of terrestrial c3 plants 72 93 hedges et al 1997 meyers 1997 lamb et al 2006 wu et al 2007 the feasible contribution of sc showed broader ranges for s1 2 0 42 and 0 32 which had higher δ13c and δ15n values 23 20 to 24 89 and 4 00 3 65 than s3 previous studies have shown higher δ13c and δ15n values for sc about 20 and 9 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 than terrestrial c3 plants the feasible contribution of rp and laver were both low for r10 and 17 5 which had low δ15n 0 75 0 82 but median values of δ13c 22 71 to 23 93 that corresponded to prevailing sources of mixed terrestrial c3 and c4 plants hedges et al 1997 meyers 1997 lamb et al 2006 wu et al 2007 however the feasible contribution of rp showed larger ranges from 0 to 18 for other sites in the rp area the laver also showed broader ranges of the feasible contribution for r14 16 and 18 in january from 0 to 30 the rp and laver also have higher δ13c about 19 and 22 5 and δ15n values about 10 and 7 5 yokoyama et al 2009 suh and shin 2013 kim et al 2020 bianchini et al 2021 than terrestrial c3 plants overall the notable changes in the elemental and isotopic composition demonstrated significant variability of diverse som sources in the coastal aquaculture area the end member mixing analysis using the isosource program could provide a useful tool for constraining the range of feasible contributions from terrestrial sources plankton and cultured organisms thus the stable isotopic ratios and isosource analysis could provide information for understanding the som source and variability under the influences of coastal aquaculture although the unique solution could not be obtained with these techniques due to the mixing of too many sources in complex environments 4 5 effects of coastal aquaculture on som assessed with pca pca was further applied for investigating the som variations and the influences of aquaculture in this study fig 6 the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 41 5 and 34 5 of the total variance respectively pc1 correlated strongly with oc tn a 300 and c1 c5 r 0 729 0 952 indicating pc1 mainly represented the som quantity pc2 correlated positively with s 275 295 bix c1 c4 c5 and dx 50 r 0 640 0 876 but correlated negatively with hix c2 and c3 r 0 864 to 0 964 this suggested that higher pc2 was related to the autochthonous sources with lower molecular weight and humic content that were associated with coarse sediments the pc1 score was highest for n2 followed by s1 and r13 indicating elevated som quantity in these silty sediments fig 6b pc2 was low for most silty sediments suggesting generally low autochthonous constituents and more terrestrial organic matter in fine sediments of both sc and rp areas pc2 was higher for most sandy sediments of the rp area indicating increased autochthonous contribution in the more open area fig 6c in particular the bivalves were cultured from spring to autumn in the study area the low pc1 for both the silty and sandy sediments in july 2019 r1 6 indicated potential removals of som by shellfish filgueira et al 2015 sanz lazaro et al 2018 the large variation of pc2 in july further indicated the variability of som source and composition across different sites the pc1 was also low for most sites in october 2019 and 2020 after the bivalves were harvested however pc1 showed higher values for r13 and s1 that might be in part caused by the contribution from the residues of dead shellfish the residues of dead shellfish could be seen in the field investigation fig s5a this was consistent with the elevated upper limit for the feasible contribution of rp at r13 0 44 and sc at s1 0 42 based on the isosource analysis fig s4 the som of the rp area in january 2020 generally had higher pc1 than the sandy sediments in other months indicating elevated som quantity fig 6c the terrestrial input was likely weak in the dry season as indicated by the high pc2 and the t test results table s2 section 4 2 thus the increased som in this month might indicate higher contributions from the freshwater marine plankton and the laver that was cultured after the harvest of shellfish fig s5b and the isosource analysis suggested a high upper limit for the feasible contribution of laver at r14 16 and 18 from 0 to 30 fig s4 5 conclusions the quantity and quality of som changed greatly in the coastal aquaculture area which was largely dependent on the grain size and the related distribution of different sediments under hydrodynamic sorting overall the coarse sediments contained significantly less organic matter and had higher fractions of autochthonous organic matter with lower molecular weight aromaticity and humic content the optical indices for the som quantity correlated strongly with oc and tn indicating similar changing patterns and underlying controlling factors this suggested that absorption and fluorescent eems parafac could provide valuable indices for estimating the content of bulk organic matter in sediments the comparison of som indices with independent samples t test between different zones and between different months showed an overall limited influence of shellfish and laver culture this supported the sustainability of these types of aquaculture that require no manual addition of feeds and are supported by substrates from terrestrial and marine sources the further applications of end member mixing analysis using the isosource program and pca were sensitive for detecting the influences of coastal aquaculture the removal of som by shellfish in the growing season and the contribution from shellfish residuals after the harvest and the cultured laver were identified at some locations in particular the stable isotopic ratios and the humic components indices e g c1 c3 and hix provided useful indices for detecting the signature of aquaculture on som since they have been found to be more stable for tracking the source of organic matter in the early diagenesis

15586,the fate and removal of ciprofloxacin a class of fluoroquinolone antibiotic during sulfur mediated biological wastewater treatment has been recently well documented however little is known regarding the genetic response of microorganisms to ciprofloxacin here a lab scale anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor was continuously operated over a long term for ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater treatment to investigate the response of the microorganisms to ciprofloxacin by adopting a metagenomics approach it was found that total organic carbon toc removal and sulfate reduction were promoted by approximately 10 under ciprofloxacin stress along with the enrichment of functional genera e g desulfobacter geobacter involved in carbon and sulfur metabolism the metagenomic analytical results demonstrated that ciprofloxacin triggered the microbial sos response as demonstrated by the up regulation of the multidrug efflux pump genes 8 125 fold higher than that of the control and ciprofloxacin degrading genes 4 33 fold higher than that of the control moreover the contents of atp nadh and cytochrome c as well as related functional genes including genes involved in energy generation electron transport carbon metabolism and sulfur metabolism were markedly increased under ciprofloxacin stress this demonstrated that the carbon and sulfur metabolisms were enhanced for energy atp generation and electron transport in response to ciprofloxacin induced stress interestingly the microbes tended to cooperate while being subjected exposure to exogenous ciprofloxacin according to the reconstructed metabolic network using the netseed model particularly the species with higher complementarity indices played more pivotal roles in strengthening microbial metabolism and the sos response under long term ciprofloxacin stress this study characterized the response mechanisms of microorganisms to ciprofloxacin at the genetic level in sulfur mediated biological wastewater treatment these new understandings will contribute the scientific basis for improving and optimizing the sulfur mediated bioprocess for antibiotics laden wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological wastewater treatment sulfate reduction ciprofloxacin microbial response mechanism data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction ciprofloxacin a broad spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic is widely used for the treatment of infections in humans and animals the consumption of ciprofloxacin in 2013 exceeded 4800 tons in china zhang et al 2015 and the consumption of ciprofloxacin accounted for 68 of the total quinolone consumption in the european union eu in 2014 ecdc 2018 notably non metabolized ciprofloxacin is commonly excreted by humans and animals via urine and feces after which high levels of this contaminant 0 1 4000 μg l in influent enter wastewater treatment plants wwtps kovalakova et al 2020 the ciprofloxacin residuals from wwtps are then ultimately discharged into natural aquatic environments with concentrations in rivers lakes and groundwater reaching up to 0 01 14 33 μg l danner et al 2019 the widespread occurrence of ciprofloxacin in the environment has led to the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args thus posing a serious threat to global public health roope et al 2019 therefore the role of wwtps as the source and sink of antibiotics including ciprofloxacin and associated args has recently become an important target of public concern michael et al 2013 the fate and removal of ciprofloxacin in wwtps have been widely studied over the last few decades ciprofloxacin is known to be highly recalcitrant to biodegradation i e with removal efficiency below 10 and therefore ciprofloxacin removal largely relies on sorption in the conventional activated sludge cas 50 removal efficiency system zhang et al 2018 however carneiro et al 2020 reported that ciprofloxacin can be effectively biodegraded 64 85 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in anaerobic fixed bed biofilm reactors nevertheless the residual ciprofloxacin in sludge and wwtp effluent can still enter natural environments via excessive sludge disposal and effluent discharge respectively moreover cas is also an energy demanding process that requires intensive aeration and generates large amounts of sludge oberoi et al 2019 furthermore ciprofloxacin can inhibit the functional microorganisms in cas and anaerobic methanogenic sludge anms systems resulting in poor pollutant removal performance chen et al 2021 kim et al 2020 yi et al 2017 reported that polyphosphate accumulating organisms glycogen accumulating organisms and denitrifying bacteria were significantly inhibited in cas system during long term ciprofloxacin exposure 200 and 2000 μg l moreover organic removal and methanogenic activity were significantly decreased in the presence of ciprofloxacin 0 5 50 mg l in an anms system mai et al 2018 in recent years a sulfur mediated biological wastewater treatment technology based on sulfate reducing bacteria srb was developed for the treatment of antibiotics contaminated wastewaters this novel technology has several inherent advantages such as less sludge production and energy consumption in addition to high tolerance against antibiotics jia et al 2019 oberoi et al 2019 sulfate reducing sludge systems were reported to efficiently remove antibiotics particularly ciprofloxacin from wastewater by operating lab scale bioreactors coupled with batch assays jia et al 2019 additionally the mechanisms of ciprofloxacin adsorption and biodegradation e g intermediates pathways and functional enzymes etc in these systems were uncovered in our previous studies jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however little is known regarding the changes in the performance microbial composition and metabolism of sulfate reducing sludge systems under long term ciprofloxacin exposure understanding these changes is critical to elucidate the microbial response mechanisms of sulfate reducing sludge systems to ciprofloxacin in turn this would enable the development of better strategies for the application of sulfur mediated biotechnology in the context of ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater treatment therefore this study sought to 1 evaluate the influence of ciprofloxacin on the performance microbial community and microbial metabolism of sulfate reducing biological processes 2 explore the microbial response mechanism to ciprofloxacin at the genetic level via metagenomic analysis and further elucidate the regulatory strategies of sulfate reducing biotechnology for the treatment of ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater these findings will deepen our understating of the microbial response mechanisms in the sulfate reducing sludge system upon exposure to ciprofloxacin which would further facilitate the application of sulfur mediated biotechnology for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with fluoroquinolone antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and operation an anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor with a working volume of 1 0 l fig 1 a was seeded with sulfate reducing sludge that had been previously enriched with srb in our laboratory the sulfate reducing bioreactor was continually operated for 268 days at room temperature 25 0 5 c and was fed with influent ciprofloxacin concentrations of 0 1000 3000 and 5000 μg l in stage i i e the first 60 days sulfate reducing sludge was acclimated by feeding the bioreactor with synthetic wastewater without ciprofloxacin as a control then the sulfate reducing bioreactor was continuously operated for another 208 days more than 60 days for each stage at different influent ciprofloxacin concentrations 1000 μg l in stage ii 3000 μg l in stage iii and 5000 μg l in stage iv tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary information si provide additional details on the operational conditions and characteristics of the synthetic wastewater at these four stages the bioreactor was operated at a solids retention time srt of 25 days and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 h the average concentration of suspended solids ss in the sulfate reducing bioreactor was approximately 9 2 0 4 g l throughout the 268 days of operation the concentrations of ss and volatile suspended solids vss are shown in fig s1 the influent effluent and sludge samples were regularly collected and analyzed for sulfate thiosulfate sulfite total dissolved sulfide total organic carbon toc and ciprofloxacin 2 2 chemical analyses the sulfate thiosulfate and sulfite in the aqueous samples were analyzed as previously described by jia et al 2018 the total dissolved sulfide toc vss and ss concentrations were determined according to standard procedures apha 2012 the temperature ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were monitored regularly using a portable ph meter mettler toledo fg2 fk switzerland see table s2 the ciprofloxacin in aqueous and sludge samples was analyzed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc equipped with a dad detector dionex ultimate 3000 ca usa using an acclaim120 c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 μm dionex ca usa as described by jia et al 2018 see pages s6 s7 in the si for more details the limits of detection and quantification of ciprofloxacin are presented in the si see page s6 extracellular polymeric substances in the sulfate reducing sludge were extracted and analyzed using the modified heat extraction method as described by zhang et al 2018 2 3 dna extraction 16s rrna and metagenome gene sequencing and data analyses genomic dna was extracted from triplicate sludge samples collected at the end of each stage i e on days 60 125 196 and 268 using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio ca usa the 515f 926r primer pair was used to amplify the hypervariable region v4 v5 of the 16s rrna gene quince et al 2011 after which the pcr products were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa at magigene guangzhou china the raw data were deposited into the ncbi database under accession number srr6003432 miseq sequencing data were processed and operational taxonomic units otus 97 similarity level were identified using the mothur software package v 1 25 1 schloss et al 2009 these data were analyzed by taking the average of the triplicates the triplicate dna samples obtained in each stage were mixed thoroughly and then sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa to obtain 250 bp paired end pe250 reads the raw metagenomic sequencing data from the four samples were deposited into the ncbi database under accession numbers srr6007445 srr6007447 quality control of raw reads was performed using trimmomatic hua et al 2015 next the clean reads were assembled into contigs using megahit https github com voutcn megahit after which the contigs were binned using metabat kang et al 2015 the quality of the retrieved metagenome assembled genomes mags was estimated using checkm version 1 0 13 parks et al 2015 finally we obtained 130 bins that met the mimag standard bowers et al 2017 each bin was then combined and visualized using esom dick et al 2009 afterward gene prediction and annotation were conducted as previously described zhang et al 2019 and the metabolic pathways for each bin were reconstructed using the kegg automatic annotation server kaas moriya et al 2007 focusing on genes related to carbon c and sulfur s metabolism 2 4 microbial interaction analysis reverse ecology analysis was conducted to elucidate the microbial eco structure and interaction among species in the sulfate reducing bioreactor using the revecor software gnu general public license v 2 0 https cran package revecor r project org cao et al 2016 the metabolic network of each species in the sulfate reducing bioreactor was reconstructed based on the annotated functional genomes using genome scale metabolic network models i e netseed as described by carr et al 2012 as well as exogenous metabolites required by each species exogenously acquired compounds were specified as a seed set i e the minimal subset of compounds involved in an organism s metabolism that cannot be synthesized from other compounds in the metabolic network additionally competition and complementarity indices which describe the interspecific interaction between pairs of species were calculated from the seed set of species metabolic networks as described by cao et al 2016 the competition index is defined as the fraction of compounds in the seed set of species a that are also included in that of species b and provides a measure of competition between species a and b similarly the complementarity index is used to assess cooperation between species a and b and is defined as the fraction of compounds present in the seed set of the metabolic network of species a but are not found in the seed set of species b levy and borenstein 2013 notably these two interaction indices are calculated as a normalized weighted sum for each seed compound and are associated with a confidence score 2 5 statistical analyses all experiments were carried out in triplicate to ensure the stability and reliability of our data and the results were reported as mean standard deviation significant differences between the experimental groups were identified via one way analysis of variance anova followed by the least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test 3 results 3 1 ciprofloxacin promoted toc removal and sulfate reduction the lab scale sulfate reducing bioreactor fig 1 a was continuously operated and monitored to investigate the possible impacts of ciprofloxacin on sulfate reducing bioprocess it is worth noticing that ciprofloxacin could be effectively removed in the system with average removal efficiencies reaching 91 8 1 4 73 6 1 0 and 62 8 2 5 at initial ciprofloxacin concentrations of 1000 3000 and 5000 μg l respectively although the overall ciprofloxacin removal efficiency decreased at higher ciprofloxacin concentrations ciprofloxacin biodegradation was significantly improved as shown in fig 1 b the biodegradation efficiency was increased from 12 9 1 2 to 28 3 1 5 when ciprofloxacin concentration increased from 1000 μg l to 5000 μg l as obtained in our previous study jia et al 2018 furthermore the specific removal rate of ciprofloxacin was dramatically increased from 433 2 3 2 μg g vss to 1480 3 5 3 μg g vss when the ciprofloxacin concentration increased from 1000 μg l to 5000 μg l moreover sulfate reduction and total organic carbon toc removal were also monitored during long term ciprofloxacin exposure fig s2 interestingly the toc removal was significantly strengthened rather than hampered after long term exposure to ciprofloxacin as shown in fig 1 c the toc removal efficiency was 80 7 1 1 in the absence of ciprofloxacin control but markedly p 0 01 increased from 83 6 3 1 to 87 5 2 8 when the ciprofloxacin concentration was increased from 1000 μg l to 5000 μg l a similar trend of sulfate reduction during long term ciprofloxacin exposure was observed the sulfate reduction efficiency was significantly p 0 01 promoted from 64 9 to 74 6 when the ciprofloxacin concentration increased from 0 to 5000 μg l fig 1 c on average 70 of sulfate was reduced into dissolved sulfide and no sulfur intermediates e g sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were detected throughout the reactor operation obviously long term ciprofloxacin exposure significantly improved the toc removal and sulfate reduction performance of the sulfate reducing system although the above results were obtained in our previous study jia et al 2018 the biological mechanism behind it particularly the response mechanism of microbes to ciprofloxacin is not clear therefore in depth microbial and metagenomic analyses at the genetic and metabolic levels were conducted in this study and discussed in the following section 3 2 effects of ciprofloxacin on the microbial community structure of the reactor next 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was conducted to assess the effect of long term treatment with different concentrations of ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater on the microbial community structure of the sulfate reducing bioreactor compared to the control treatment with no ciprofloxacin addition ciprofloxacin exposure significantly decreased microbial diversity p 0 05 as demonstrated by a decrease in the simpson and shannon indices detailed information of the sequenced reads as well as the ace chao shannon and simpson indices is provided in table s3 principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distance revealed that the microbial community structure of each stage was markedly distinct i e control ciprofloxacin concentrations of 1000 3000 and 5000 μg l fig s3 fig 2 illustrates the variations in the microbial community composition under different ciprofloxacin concentrations the functional genera in the sulfate reducing sludge mainly encompassed four groups 1 organic substrate degrading bacteria including sphaerochaeta geobacter paludibacter ornatilinea and leptolinea which can use mono di and tri saccharides and refractory organics as carbon and energy sources reguera et al 2019 troshina et al 2015 qiu et al 2014 yamada et al 2006 podosokorskaya et al 2013 2 sulfate reducing bacteria that can use organic carbon as electron donors and energy sources including desulfobulbus desulfocapsa desulfococcus desulfuromonas and desulfobacter particularly desulfobacter with high ciprofloxacin tolerance cordova kreylos and scow 2007 3 nitrogen metabolizing bacteria including thauera thiobacillus and arcobacter and 4 syntrophic bacteria capable of associating with other microorganisms such as zoogloea which can provide amino acids for other microorganisms dahal et al 2020 and mesotoga which provides hydrogen for srb e g desulfobulbus desulfobacter etc as electron donor via interspecies hydrogen transfer fadhlaoui et al 2018 ciprofloxacin exposure markedly shaped the microbial structure in the sulfate reducing bioreactor during long term operation for example the abundances of victivallis and syntrophus which represented organic degrading genera and desulfobulbus and desulfocapsa representing sulfate reducing genera decreased upon exposure to ciprofloxacin suggesting that they were sensitive to this compound in contrast the abundances of geobacter a representative organic degrading genus desulfobacter a sulfate reducing genus and zoogloea a syntrophic genus increased during long term ciprofloxacin exposure indicating that they were tolerant to ciprofloxacin the total abundances of organic substrate degrading bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria did not significantly change during long term exposure to ciprofloxacin fig s4 which was consistent with the results of toc removal and sulfate reduction in the sulfate reducing bioreactor fig 1 to provide further insights into the microbial response to ciprofloxacin in depth metagenomic analyses at the genetic and metabolic levels were conducted 3 3 metagenomic analyses revealed that ciprofloxacin affects microbial metabolism 3 3 1 ciprofloxacin induces the sos response of bacteria it is well known that antibiotics can induce the microbial sos response including antibiotic resistance and dna repair among others andersson and hughes 2014 antibiotic efflux pumps constitute a key mechanism of antibiotic resistance which also plays an important protective role against exogenous stress blair et al 2014 in this study the multi drug efflux pump system was activated upon exposure to ciprofloxacin and several functional genes were significantly p 0 05 up regulated including 9 resistance nodulation cell division rnd antibiotic efflux genes 18 major facilitator superfamily mfs antibiotic efflux genes and 3 atp binding cassette abc antibiotic efflux genes fig 3 the abundance of efflux genes during long term ciprofloxacin exposure was 8 125 fold higher than that of the control with no ciprofloxacin these findings indicated that the multi drug efflux pump system was triggered thus enhancing the transportation efflux of ciprofloxacin from intra to extra cellular matrices moreover several ciprofloxacin degrading genes were also up regulated across all ciprofloxacin concentrations 1000 3000 and 5000 μg l for instance the genes encoding for the dehydrogenase and non specific monooxygenase enzymes which play important roles in ciprofloxacin degradation fang et al 2021 jia et al 2019 were also up regulated by 4 33 fold compared with the control fig s5 these results were consistent with the increase in ciprofloxacin specific removal rate in fig 1 moreover some functional genes encoding ribosomal proteins e g rpl5 rpl11 and rps3 which play crucial roles in response to dna damage were significantly up regulated kim et al 2014 amelio et al 2020 fig s6 3 3 2 ciprofloxacin stimulated carbon sulfur and amino acid metabolism the influence of ciprofloxacin on the microbial metabolism in the sulfate reducing sludge system was also examined by metagenomic analysis under long term ciprofloxacin exposure several functional genes e g glk pgi pgm pgk eno gpml gpmb etc encoding enzymes involved in the glycerol catabolism schröder et al 1994 were dramatically up regulated fig 4 additionally genes encoding enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism e g acee and porabcd bouillaut et al 2013 and the tca cycle e g acss1 2 idh aarc acnab aclb were also up regulated under all ciprofloxacin concentrations fig 4 interestingly similar results were observed for sulfur metabolism specifically genes encoding enzymes for sulfate transport i e cysapwu the from extracellular to the intracellular matrix via the abc type transporter were up regulated under ciprofloxacin exposure sirko et al 1990 kushkevych et al 2020 fig 5 furthermore functional genes encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase sat adenylylsulfate reductase aprb and dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsrb all of which are involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr were significantly p 0 05 up regulated when the ciprofloxacin concentration increased from 0 control to 5000 μg l fig 5 the up regulation of functional genes involved in dsr indicated that ciprofloxacin stimulated the uptake and conversion of sulfate additionally up regulation of genes encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase cysd and cysn sulfite reductase nadph hemoprotein cysl serine o acetyltransferase cyse and cysteine synthase cysk was also detected fig 5 indicating that srb could utilize the generated sulfide to synthesize l cysteine via the assimilatory sulfate reduction asr pathway for cell growth kushkevych et al 2020 these findings were consistent with the increased relative abundance of srb in the sulfate reducing bioreactor after long term feeding with ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater fig s4 in addition to carbon and sulfur metabolism genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis i e aroabc trpdefg were also up regulated under ciprofloxacin stress fig s7 in turn this could lead to the generation of more extracellular polymeric substances eps fig s7 especially tyrosine tryptophan and lysine which are the main components of eps that play a protective role against toxic substances by adsorbing exogenous organic compounds such as ciprofloxacin zhang et al 2019 the stimulation of metabolic functions also enhanced atp generation and electron proton transfer particularly genes encoding enzymes associated with atp synthesis atpa to atpg ntpa to ntpg nadh synthesis nuoa to nuon and electron proton transfer e g cconop coxabd cyoabcd were significantly enriched during long term ciprofloxacin exposure fig s8 furthermore the contents of atp nadh and cytochrome c in the sulfate reducing sludge were significantly p 0 05 higher in the presence of ciprofloxacin compared with the control fig s8 3 3 3 ciprofloxacin promoted cooperation between core microbes to further characterize the microbial interaction in the sulfate reducing sludge under ciprofloxacin stress 130 metagenome assembled genomes mags were reconstructed fig s9 and 12 high quality bins were ultimately selected to form a sub community core species according to key selection criteria completeness 95 contamination 2 and relative abundance 0 1 see table s4 for details the competition and complementarity indices among species 130 mags were evaluated using the revecor software based on the reverse ecology method michelini et al 2018 interestingly increasing ciprofloxacin concentrations from 0 to 5000 μg l resulted in a decrease in the competition index and an increase in the complementarity index fig s10 moreover the complementarity and competition indices for each microbe microbe pair in the sub community 12 bins were also calculated fig 6 and the nutrient profile of each species was further inferred see the supplementary material for more detailed results in the sub community bin 54 desulfobacter postgatei an acetate utilizing srb goevert et al 2008 was the most supported species fig 6 c and complemented most of the community members complementarity score ranging from 0 12 to 0 46 table s5 bin 54 can provide thiosulfate sulfide involved in sulfur metabolism e g for bin 6 bin 42 bin 105 and bin 126 d glucose and formate involved in carbon metabolism e g for bin 6 bin 29 bin 31 bin 42 bin 69 and some amino acids for other genera e g for bin 69 bin 73 bin 101 bin 105 bin 123 bin 126 etc in the sub community see the supplementary material for more details moreover bin 54 was the least supported bacterium with complementarity scores ranging from 0 04 to 0 19 table s5 which could be due to its higher completeness of metabolic pathways for carbon and sulfur bioconversion than other species more details in supplementary material additionally bin 54 showed higher competition indices than other species with an average competition score of 0 53 see table s6 it is also worth noting that bin 73 trichlorobacter spp and bin 54 were closely related and formed competitive pairs 0 73 0 54 see fig 6 b and table s6 that shared similar nutrients e g acetate sulfate l lysine etc however bin 73 with a complementarity score of 0 16 showed lower potential for supporting other species compared to bin 54 with a complementarity score of 0 21 see table s5 in si for more details therefore bin 73 gradually became a non dominant species after long term ciprofloxacin exposure table s4 and similar trends were observed for bin 31 mesotoga spp and bin 69 f lentimicrobiaceae in addition to bin 54 bin 6 f uba12059 bin 23 pseudodesulfuromonas thiophila bin 101 f pgxb01 bin105 mesotoga spp bin 123 uba6192 spp and bin 126 f halothiobacillaceae were also abundant species and are known to play important roles in carbon and sulfur metabolism finster et al 1997 fadhlaoui et al 2018 additionally all of the aforementioned species exhibited high levels of competitiveness with competition scores ranging from 0 44 to 0 58 see table s6 although less competitive bin 42 pararheinheimera spp can survive and synergistically grow with support from other species e g bin 6 and bin 54 with support scores of 0 34 and 0 46 respectively under ciprofloxacin stress table s5 chambers et al 2021 oyagi et al 2021 4 discussion antibiotics were commonly detected in wwtps which can severely affect the microbiota of wastewater treatment systems studying the effects of long term antibiotic exposure on ecosystems and microbiomes can provide important insights into the mechanisms involved in microbial adaptation to antibiotics in turn this could allow for the development of strategies to preserve the stability of bioreactors when treating antibiotic contaminated wastewater however limited studies had previously explored the microbial response mechanisms to antibiotics in biological wastewater treatment systems especially in a sulfate reducing sludge system here we evaluated the effects of long term ciprofloxacin a commonly prescribed antibiotic exposure on the microbial response mechanisms in a sulfate reducing sludge system using a metagenomic analysis approach surprisingly long term ciprofloxacin exposure substantially improved toc removal and sulfate reduction indicating that the microbes adjusted to the condition changes induced by ciprofloxacin and maintained the system s stability based on the microbial analysis results ciprofloxacin markedly affected the microbial community structure of the reactor in the ciprofloxacin exposed treatments there was a significant enrichment of genera with high tolerance to ciprofloxacin that were involved in carbon and sulfur conversion e g desulfobacter geobacter etc thus these microorganisms became dominant during the long term ciprofloxacin exposure furthermore a variety of strategies were also used by the microorganisms to cope with ciprofloxacin induced stress as illustrated in fig 7 first the ciprofloxacin stress message was rapidly conveyed through a signaling pathway involving ribosomal proteins e g rpl11 and rpl5 golomb et al 2014 as demonstrated by an up regulation of functional genes coding for ribosomal proteins upon exposure to ciprofloxacin fig s6 subsequently the microbial multiple response systems were activated for instance the antibiotic resistance mediated sos response was activated to reduce the cell damage induced by ciprofloxacin with the up regulation of multi drug efflux genes i e abc type rnd type and mfs type efflux genes fig 3 most intracellular ciprofloxacin was transported to the extracellular matrix via the efflux pump system which reduced the cell damage caused by ciprofloxacin accumulation piddock 2006 moreover the increase in eps production stimulated biofilm formation fig s7 which can block the entrance of antibiotics e g ciprofloxacin into the cell by tightly binding with the antibiotics and degrading them thereafter donlan 2002 these results were consistent with the findings of our previous study zhang et al 2018 furthermore some intracellular ciprofloxacin could be degraded into less toxic organic compounds by non specific enzymes e g dehydrogenase and monooxygenase secreted by microorganisms our findings indicated that the abundance of genes encoding dehydrogenase and monooxygenase increased by 4 33 fold in the presence of ciprofloxacin additionally the related degradation intermediates of ciprofloxacin were observed in our previous studies jia et al 2019 suggesting that some non specific enzymes e g dehydrogenase and monooxygenase played important roles in ciprofloxacin degradation fang et al 2021 the dna repair system was also activated in response to the dna damage caused by ciprofloxacin exposure for example the functional gene encoding the dna repair endonuclease rps3 jang et al 2004 was significantly up regulated under ciprofloxacin stress fig s6 the response against exogenous stress e g ciprofloxacin in microorganisms requires energy atp and electron donors e g nadh which are produced via carbon metabolism bui et al 2017 our findings indicated that ciprofloxacin stress induced an increase in atp nadh electron donor and cytochrome c which plays important roles in electron transport as well as related functional genes fig s8 these findings indicated that ciprofloxacin substantially promoted energy generation and electron transport in turn these results suggested that ciprofloxacin exposure stimulated carbon metabolism to enhance energy production which was further confirmed by the up regulation of key genes involved in carbon metabolism including glycerol catabolism pyruvate metabolism and the tca cycle fig 4 key genes involved in sulfur metabolism were also highly up regulated under ciprofloxacin stress fig 5 suggesting that ciprofloxacin stimulated sulfur metabolism the intermediates of carbon metabolism e g acetate mono and di carboxylic aliphatic acids alcohols polar aromatic compounds and even hydrocarbons can be utilized as electron donors by srb rabus et al 2013 previous studies have reported the similar microbial response that high concentration of ciprofloxacin induced stress e g 10 mg l stimulated the metabolism of microorganisms in activated sludge system including carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism indicating that microbes have formed a special metabolic pattern to maintain good cellular activity and increase their resistance to ciprofloxacin chen et al 2021 however lu et al 2019 found that microorganisms including eukaryotes and prokaryotes in freshwater generated different responses to ciprofloxacin in metabolism e g the strengthening of the two component regulatory system and enhancing the production of antitoxin against ciprofloxacin stress interestingly ciprofloxacin exposure resulted in a decrease in the competition index and an increase in the complementarity index fig s10 this result suggested that a cooperative alliance was established between microorganisms under long term ciprofloxacin stress which was further confirmed by the reconstructed metabolic network using the netseed model this means that the microorganisms in the sulfate reducing sludge system tended to cooperate rather than compete under exogenous ciprofloxacin stress furthermore the species that exhibited the highest levels of cooperation in the microbial community with higher complementarity index see table s5 for details became dominant due to their outstanding ability for synergistic carbon and sulfur metabolism and protective mechanisms against ciprofloxacin collectively our findings demonstrated that long term ciprofloxacin exposure triggered the sos response of the microorganisms in the sulfate reducing sludge system this activated the efflux and degradation of ciprofloxacin and stimulated the energy intensive carbon and sulfur metabolism to increase the resistance against ciprofloxacin these above findings can provide insight into the microbial response mechanisms to ciprofloxacin thus can provide a basis for the development of strategies to preserve the stability of sulfate reducing sludge system when treating ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater 5 conclusion our study elucidated the effect of ciprofloxacin on the performance and microbial community of an anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor and the microbial response to ciprofloxacin was comprehensively investigated by metagenomics analysis our findings indicated that ciprofloxacin shaped the microbial community resulting in the enrichment of functional genera involved in carbon and sulfur metabolisms which were outstanding in ciprofloxacin defense based on our metagenomics analyses ciprofloxacin induced the microbial sos response including the efflux pump and degradation of ciprofloxacin and dna repair additionally ciprofloxacin stimulated carbon sulfur and amino acid metabolism to increase microbial resistance against ciprofloxacin by promoting energy generation and biofilm formation interestingly the microbes in the sulfate reducing sludge system tended to cooperate rather than compete under long term ciprofloxacin exposure as demonstrated by reverse ecology analysis using the revecor software the species with high complementarity indices protected each other against ciprofloxacin stress and therefore became dominant in the sulfate reducing sludge under long term ciprofloxacin stress in this study we characterized the response mechanisms of microorganisms to ciprofloxacin at the genetic level in a sulfate reducing sludge system author contributions yanyan jia conducted all the experiments involved in chemical analyses and metagenomics analysis and prepared the manuscript pandeng wang

15586,the fate and removal of ciprofloxacin a class of fluoroquinolone antibiotic during sulfur mediated biological wastewater treatment has been recently well documented however little is known regarding the genetic response of microorganisms to ciprofloxacin here a lab scale anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor was continuously operated over a long term for ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater treatment to investigate the response of the microorganisms to ciprofloxacin by adopting a metagenomics approach it was found that total organic carbon toc removal and sulfate reduction were promoted by approximately 10 under ciprofloxacin stress along with the enrichment of functional genera e g desulfobacter geobacter involved in carbon and sulfur metabolism the metagenomic analytical results demonstrated that ciprofloxacin triggered the microbial sos response as demonstrated by the up regulation of the multidrug efflux pump genes 8 125 fold higher than that of the control and ciprofloxacin degrading genes 4 33 fold higher than that of the control moreover the contents of atp nadh and cytochrome c as well as related functional genes including genes involved in energy generation electron transport carbon metabolism and sulfur metabolism were markedly increased under ciprofloxacin stress this demonstrated that the carbon and sulfur metabolisms were enhanced for energy atp generation and electron transport in response to ciprofloxacin induced stress interestingly the microbes tended to cooperate while being subjected exposure to exogenous ciprofloxacin according to the reconstructed metabolic network using the netseed model particularly the species with higher complementarity indices played more pivotal roles in strengthening microbial metabolism and the sos response under long term ciprofloxacin stress this study characterized the response mechanisms of microorganisms to ciprofloxacin at the genetic level in sulfur mediated biological wastewater treatment these new understandings will contribute the scientific basis for improving and optimizing the sulfur mediated bioprocess for antibiotics laden wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological wastewater treatment sulfate reduction ciprofloxacin microbial response mechanism data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction ciprofloxacin a broad spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic is widely used for the treatment of infections in humans and animals the consumption of ciprofloxacin in 2013 exceeded 4800 tons in china zhang et al 2015 and the consumption of ciprofloxacin accounted for 68 of the total quinolone consumption in the european union eu in 2014 ecdc 2018 notably non metabolized ciprofloxacin is commonly excreted by humans and animals via urine and feces after which high levels of this contaminant 0 1 4000 μg l in influent enter wastewater treatment plants wwtps kovalakova et al 2020 the ciprofloxacin residuals from wwtps are then ultimately discharged into natural aquatic environments with concentrations in rivers lakes and groundwater reaching up to 0 01 14 33 μg l danner et al 2019 the widespread occurrence of ciprofloxacin in the environment has led to the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args thus posing a serious threat to global public health roope et al 2019 therefore the role of wwtps as the source and sink of antibiotics including ciprofloxacin and associated args has recently become an important target of public concern michael et al 2013 the fate and removal of ciprofloxacin in wwtps have been widely studied over the last few decades ciprofloxacin is known to be highly recalcitrant to biodegradation i e with removal efficiency below 10 and therefore ciprofloxacin removal largely relies on sorption in the conventional activated sludge cas 50 removal efficiency system zhang et al 2018 however carneiro et al 2020 reported that ciprofloxacin can be effectively biodegraded 64 85 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in anaerobic fixed bed biofilm reactors nevertheless the residual ciprofloxacin in sludge and wwtp effluent can still enter natural environments via excessive sludge disposal and effluent discharge respectively moreover cas is also an energy demanding process that requires intensive aeration and generates large amounts of sludge oberoi et al 2019 furthermore ciprofloxacin can inhibit the functional microorganisms in cas and anaerobic methanogenic sludge anms systems resulting in poor pollutant removal performance chen et al 2021 kim et al 2020 yi et al 2017 reported that polyphosphate accumulating organisms glycogen accumulating organisms and denitrifying bacteria were significantly inhibited in cas system during long term ciprofloxacin exposure 200 and 2000 μg l moreover organic removal and methanogenic activity were significantly decreased in the presence of ciprofloxacin 0 5 50 mg l in an anms system mai et al 2018 in recent years a sulfur mediated biological wastewater treatment technology based on sulfate reducing bacteria srb was developed for the treatment of antibiotics contaminated wastewaters this novel technology has several inherent advantages such as less sludge production and energy consumption in addition to high tolerance against antibiotics jia et al 2019 oberoi et al 2019 sulfate reducing sludge systems were reported to efficiently remove antibiotics particularly ciprofloxacin from wastewater by operating lab scale bioreactors coupled with batch assays jia et al 2019 additionally the mechanisms of ciprofloxacin adsorption and biodegradation e g intermediates pathways and functional enzymes etc in these systems were uncovered in our previous studies jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however little is known regarding the changes in the performance microbial composition and metabolism of sulfate reducing sludge systems under long term ciprofloxacin exposure understanding these changes is critical to elucidate the microbial response mechanisms of sulfate reducing sludge systems to ciprofloxacin in turn this would enable the development of better strategies for the application of sulfur mediated biotechnology in the context of ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater treatment therefore this study sought to 1 evaluate the influence of ciprofloxacin on the performance microbial community and microbial metabolism of sulfate reducing biological processes 2 explore the microbial response mechanism to ciprofloxacin at the genetic level via metagenomic analysis and further elucidate the regulatory strategies of sulfate reducing biotechnology for the treatment of ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater these findings will deepen our understating of the microbial response mechanisms in the sulfate reducing sludge system upon exposure to ciprofloxacin which would further facilitate the application of sulfur mediated biotechnology for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with fluoroquinolone antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and operation an anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor with a working volume of 1 0 l fig 1 a was seeded with sulfate reducing sludge that had been previously enriched with srb in our laboratory the sulfate reducing bioreactor was continually operated for 268 days at room temperature 25 0 5 c and was fed with influent ciprofloxacin concentrations of 0 1000 3000 and 5000 μg l in stage i i e the first 60 days sulfate reducing sludge was acclimated by feeding the bioreactor with synthetic wastewater without ciprofloxacin as a control then the sulfate reducing bioreactor was continuously operated for another 208 days more than 60 days for each stage at different influent ciprofloxacin concentrations 1000 μg l in stage ii 3000 μg l in stage iii and 5000 μg l in stage iv tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary information si provide additional details on the operational conditions and characteristics of the synthetic wastewater at these four stages the bioreactor was operated at a solids retention time srt of 25 days and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 h the average concentration of suspended solids ss in the sulfate reducing bioreactor was approximately 9 2 0 4 g l throughout the 268 days of operation the concentrations of ss and volatile suspended solids vss are shown in fig s1 the influent effluent and sludge samples were regularly collected and analyzed for sulfate thiosulfate sulfite total dissolved sulfide total organic carbon toc and ciprofloxacin 2 2 chemical analyses the sulfate thiosulfate and sulfite in the aqueous samples were analyzed as previously described by jia et al 2018 the total dissolved sulfide toc vss and ss concentrations were determined according to standard procedures apha 2012 the temperature ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were monitored regularly using a portable ph meter mettler toledo fg2 fk switzerland see table s2 the ciprofloxacin in aqueous and sludge samples was analyzed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc equipped with a dad detector dionex ultimate 3000 ca usa using an acclaim120 c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 μm dionex ca usa as described by jia et al 2018 see pages s6 s7 in the si for more details the limits of detection and quantification of ciprofloxacin are presented in the si see page s6 extracellular polymeric substances in the sulfate reducing sludge were extracted and analyzed using the modified heat extraction method as described by zhang et al 2018 2 3 dna extraction 16s rrna and metagenome gene sequencing and data analyses genomic dna was extracted from triplicate sludge samples collected at the end of each stage i e on days 60 125 196 and 268 using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio ca usa the 515f 926r primer pair was used to amplify the hypervariable region v4 v5 of the 16s rrna gene quince et al 2011 after which the pcr products were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa at magigene guangzhou china the raw data were deposited into the ncbi database under accession number srr6003432 miseq sequencing data were processed and operational taxonomic units otus 97 similarity level were identified using the mothur software package v 1 25 1 schloss et al 2009 these data were analyzed by taking the average of the triplicates the triplicate dna samples obtained in each stage were mixed thoroughly and then sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa to obtain 250 bp paired end pe250 reads the raw metagenomic sequencing data from the four samples were deposited into the ncbi database under accession numbers srr6007445 srr6007447 quality control of raw reads was performed using trimmomatic hua et al 2015 next the clean reads were assembled into contigs using megahit https github com voutcn megahit after which the contigs were binned using metabat kang et al 2015 the quality of the retrieved metagenome assembled genomes mags was estimated using checkm version 1 0 13 parks et al 2015 finally we obtained 130 bins that met the mimag standard bowers et al 2017 each bin was then combined and visualized using esom dick et al 2009 afterward gene prediction and annotation were conducted as previously described zhang et al 2019 and the metabolic pathways for each bin were reconstructed using the kegg automatic annotation server kaas moriya et al 2007 focusing on genes related to carbon c and sulfur s metabolism 2 4 microbial interaction analysis reverse ecology analysis was conducted to elucidate the microbial eco structure and interaction among species in the sulfate reducing bioreactor using the revecor software gnu general public license v 2 0 https cran package revecor r project org cao et al 2016 the metabolic network of each species in the sulfate reducing bioreactor was reconstructed based on the annotated functional genomes using genome scale metabolic network models i e netseed as described by carr et al 2012 as well as exogenous metabolites required by each species exogenously acquired compounds were specified as a seed set i e the minimal subset of compounds involved in an organism s metabolism that cannot be synthesized from other compounds in the metabolic network additionally competition and complementarity indices which describe the interspecific interaction between pairs of species were calculated from the seed set of species metabolic networks as described by cao et al 2016 the competition index is defined as the fraction of compounds in the seed set of species a that are also included in that of species b and provides a measure of competition between species a and b similarly the complementarity index is used to assess cooperation between species a and b and is defined as the fraction of compounds present in the seed set of the metabolic network of species a but are not found in the seed set of species b levy and borenstein 2013 notably these two interaction indices are calculated as a normalized weighted sum for each seed compound and are associated with a confidence score 2 5 statistical analyses all experiments were carried out in triplicate to ensure the stability and reliability of our data and the results were reported as mean standard deviation significant differences between the experimental groups were identified via one way analysis of variance anova followed by the least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test 3 results 3 1 ciprofloxacin promoted toc removal and sulfate reduction the lab scale sulfate reducing bioreactor fig 1 a was continuously operated and monitored to investigate the possible impacts of ciprofloxacin on sulfate reducing bioprocess it is worth noticing that ciprofloxacin could be effectively removed in the system with average removal efficiencies reaching 91 8 1 4 73 6 1 0 and 62 8 2 5 at initial ciprofloxacin concentrations of 1000 3000 and 5000 μg l respectively although the overall ciprofloxacin removal efficiency decreased at higher ciprofloxacin concentrations ciprofloxacin biodegradation was significantly improved as shown in fig 1 b the biodegradation efficiency was increased from 12 9 1 2 to 28 3 1 5 when ciprofloxacin concentration increased from 1000 μg l to 5000 μg l as obtained in our previous study jia et al 2018 furthermore the specific removal rate of ciprofloxacin was dramatically increased from 433 2 3 2 μg g vss to 1480 3 5 3 μg g vss when the ciprofloxacin concentration increased from 1000 μg l to 5000 μg l moreover sulfate reduction and total organic carbon toc removal were also monitored during long term ciprofloxacin exposure fig s2 interestingly the toc removal was significantly strengthened rather than hampered after long term exposure to ciprofloxacin as shown in fig 1 c the toc removal efficiency was 80 7 1 1 in the absence of ciprofloxacin control but markedly p 0 01 increased from 83 6 3 1 to 87 5 2 8 when the ciprofloxacin concentration was increased from 1000 μg l to 5000 μg l a similar trend of sulfate reduction during long term ciprofloxacin exposure was observed the sulfate reduction efficiency was significantly p 0 01 promoted from 64 9 to 74 6 when the ciprofloxacin concentration increased from 0 to 5000 μg l fig 1 c on average 70 of sulfate was reduced into dissolved sulfide and no sulfur intermediates e g sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were detected throughout the reactor operation obviously long term ciprofloxacin exposure significantly improved the toc removal and sulfate reduction performance of the sulfate reducing system although the above results were obtained in our previous study jia et al 2018 the biological mechanism behind it particularly the response mechanism of microbes to ciprofloxacin is not clear therefore in depth microbial and metagenomic analyses at the genetic and metabolic levels were conducted in this study and discussed in the following section 3 2 effects of ciprofloxacin on the microbial community structure of the reactor next 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was conducted to assess the effect of long term treatment with different concentrations of ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater on the microbial community structure of the sulfate reducing bioreactor compared to the control treatment with no ciprofloxacin addition ciprofloxacin exposure significantly decreased microbial diversity p 0 05 as demonstrated by a decrease in the simpson and shannon indices detailed information of the sequenced reads as well as the ace chao shannon and simpson indices is provided in table s3 principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis distance revealed that the microbial community structure of each stage was markedly distinct i e control ciprofloxacin concentrations of 1000 3000 and 5000 μg l fig s3 fig 2 illustrates the variations in the microbial community composition under different ciprofloxacin concentrations the functional genera in the sulfate reducing sludge mainly encompassed four groups 1 organic substrate degrading bacteria including sphaerochaeta geobacter paludibacter ornatilinea and leptolinea which can use mono di and tri saccharides and refractory organics as carbon and energy sources reguera et al 2019 troshina et al 2015 qiu et al 2014 yamada et al 2006 podosokorskaya et al 2013 2 sulfate reducing bacteria that can use organic carbon as electron donors and energy sources including desulfobulbus desulfocapsa desulfococcus desulfuromonas and desulfobacter particularly desulfobacter with high ciprofloxacin tolerance cordova kreylos and scow 2007 3 nitrogen metabolizing bacteria including thauera thiobacillus and arcobacter and 4 syntrophic bacteria capable of associating with other microorganisms such as zoogloea which can provide amino acids for other microorganisms dahal et al 2020 and mesotoga which provides hydrogen for srb e g desulfobulbus desulfobacter etc as electron donor via interspecies hydrogen transfer fadhlaoui et al 2018 ciprofloxacin exposure markedly shaped the microbial structure in the sulfate reducing bioreactor during long term operation for example the abundances of victivallis and syntrophus which represented organic degrading genera and desulfobulbus and desulfocapsa representing sulfate reducing genera decreased upon exposure to ciprofloxacin suggesting that they were sensitive to this compound in contrast the abundances of geobacter a representative organic degrading genus desulfobacter a sulfate reducing genus and zoogloea a syntrophic genus increased during long term ciprofloxacin exposure indicating that they were tolerant to ciprofloxacin the total abundances of organic substrate degrading bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria did not significantly change during long term exposure to ciprofloxacin fig s4 which was consistent with the results of toc removal and sulfate reduction in the sulfate reducing bioreactor fig 1 to provide further insights into the microbial response to ciprofloxacin in depth metagenomic analyses at the genetic and metabolic levels were conducted 3 3 metagenomic analyses revealed that ciprofloxacin affects microbial metabolism 3 3 1 ciprofloxacin induces the sos response of bacteria it is well known that antibiotics can induce the microbial sos response including antibiotic resistance and dna repair among others andersson and hughes 2014 antibiotic efflux pumps constitute a key mechanism of antibiotic resistance which also plays an important protective role against exogenous stress blair et al 2014 in this study the multi drug efflux pump system was activated upon exposure to ciprofloxacin and several functional genes were significantly p 0 05 up regulated including 9 resistance nodulation cell division rnd antibiotic efflux genes 18 major facilitator superfamily mfs antibiotic efflux genes and 3 atp binding cassette abc antibiotic efflux genes fig 3 the abundance of efflux genes during long term ciprofloxacin exposure was 8 125 fold higher than that of the control with no ciprofloxacin these findings indicated that the multi drug efflux pump system was triggered thus enhancing the transportation efflux of ciprofloxacin from intra to extra cellular matrices moreover several ciprofloxacin degrading genes were also up regulated across all ciprofloxacin concentrations 1000 3000 and 5000 μg l for instance the genes encoding for the dehydrogenase and non specific monooxygenase enzymes which play important roles in ciprofloxacin degradation fang et al 2021 jia et al 2019 were also up regulated by 4 33 fold compared with the control fig s5 these results were consistent with the increase in ciprofloxacin specific removal rate in fig 1 moreover some functional genes encoding ribosomal proteins e g rpl5 rpl11 and rps3 which play crucial roles in response to dna damage were significantly up regulated kim et al 2014 amelio et al 2020 fig s6 3 3 2 ciprofloxacin stimulated carbon sulfur and amino acid metabolism the influence of ciprofloxacin on the microbial metabolism in the sulfate reducing sludge system was also examined by metagenomic analysis under long term ciprofloxacin exposure several functional genes e g glk pgi pgm pgk eno gpml gpmb etc encoding enzymes involved in the glycerol catabolism schröder et al 1994 were dramatically up regulated fig 4 additionally genes encoding enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism e g acee and porabcd bouillaut et al 2013 and the tca cycle e g acss1 2 idh aarc acnab aclb were also up regulated under all ciprofloxacin concentrations fig 4 interestingly similar results were observed for sulfur metabolism specifically genes encoding enzymes for sulfate transport i e cysapwu the from extracellular to the intracellular matrix via the abc type transporter were up regulated under ciprofloxacin exposure sirko et al 1990 kushkevych et al 2020 fig 5 furthermore functional genes encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase sat adenylylsulfate reductase aprb and dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsrb all of which are involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr were significantly p 0 05 up regulated when the ciprofloxacin concentration increased from 0 control to 5000 μg l fig 5 the up regulation of functional genes involved in dsr indicated that ciprofloxacin stimulated the uptake and conversion of sulfate additionally up regulation of genes encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase cysd and cysn sulfite reductase nadph hemoprotein cysl serine o acetyltransferase cyse and cysteine synthase cysk was also detected fig 5 indicating that srb could utilize the generated sulfide to synthesize l cysteine via the assimilatory sulfate reduction asr pathway for cell growth kushkevych et al 2020 these findings were consistent with the increased relative abundance of srb in the sulfate reducing bioreactor after long term feeding with ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater fig s4 in addition to carbon and sulfur metabolism genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis i e aroabc trpdefg were also up regulated under ciprofloxacin stress fig s7 in turn this could lead to the generation of more extracellular polymeric substances eps fig s7 especially tyrosine tryptophan and lysine which are the main components of eps that play a protective role against toxic substances by adsorbing exogenous organic compounds such as ciprofloxacin zhang et al 2019 the stimulation of metabolic functions also enhanced atp generation and electron proton transfer particularly genes encoding enzymes associated with atp synthesis atpa to atpg ntpa to ntpg nadh synthesis nuoa to nuon and electron proton transfer e g cconop coxabd cyoabcd were significantly enriched during long term ciprofloxacin exposure fig s8 furthermore the contents of atp nadh and cytochrome c in the sulfate reducing sludge were significantly p 0 05 higher in the presence of ciprofloxacin compared with the control fig s8 3 3 3 ciprofloxacin promoted cooperation between core microbes to further characterize the microbial interaction in the sulfate reducing sludge under ciprofloxacin stress 130 metagenome assembled genomes mags were reconstructed fig s9 and 12 high quality bins were ultimately selected to form a sub community core species according to key selection criteria completeness 95 contamination 2 and relative abundance 0 1 see table s4 for details the competition and complementarity indices among species 130 mags were evaluated using the revecor software based on the reverse ecology method michelini et al 2018 interestingly increasing ciprofloxacin concentrations from 0 to 5000 μg l resulted in a decrease in the competition index and an increase in the complementarity index fig s10 moreover the complementarity and competition indices for each microbe microbe pair in the sub community 12 bins were also calculated fig 6 and the nutrient profile of each species was further inferred see the supplementary material for more detailed results in the sub community bin 54 desulfobacter postgatei an acetate utilizing srb goevert et al 2008 was the most supported species fig 6 c and complemented most of the community members complementarity score ranging from 0 12 to 0 46 table s5 bin 54 can provide thiosulfate sulfide involved in sulfur metabolism e g for bin 6 bin 42 bin 105 and bin 126 d glucose and formate involved in carbon metabolism e g for bin 6 bin 29 bin 31 bin 42 bin 69 and some amino acids for other genera e g for bin 69 bin 73 bin 101 bin 105 bin 123 bin 126 etc in the sub community see the supplementary material for more details moreover bin 54 was the least supported bacterium with complementarity scores ranging from 0 04 to 0 19 table s5 which could be due to its higher completeness of metabolic pathways for carbon and sulfur bioconversion than other species more details in supplementary material additionally bin 54 showed higher competition indices than other species with an average competition score of 0 53 see table s6 it is also worth noting that bin 73 trichlorobacter spp and bin 54 were closely related and formed competitive pairs 0 73 0 54 see fig 6 b and table s6 that shared similar nutrients e g acetate sulfate l lysine etc however bin 73 with a complementarity score of 0 16 showed lower potential for supporting other species compared to bin 54 with a complementarity score of 0 21 see table s5 in si for more details therefore bin 73 gradually became a non dominant species after long term ciprofloxacin exposure table s4 and similar trends were observed for bin 31 mesotoga spp and bin 69 f lentimicrobiaceae in addition to bin 54 bin 6 f uba12059 bin 23 pseudodesulfuromonas thiophila bin 101 f pgxb01 bin105 mesotoga spp bin 123 uba6192 spp and bin 126 f halothiobacillaceae were also abundant species and are known to play important roles in carbon and sulfur metabolism finster et al 1997 fadhlaoui et al 2018 additionally all of the aforementioned species exhibited high levels of competitiveness with competition scores ranging from 0 44 to 0 58 see table s6 although less competitive bin 42 pararheinheimera spp can survive and synergistically grow with support from other species e g bin 6 and bin 54 with support scores of 0 34 and 0 46 respectively under ciprofloxacin stress table s5 chambers et al 2021 oyagi et al 2021 4 discussion antibiotics were commonly detected in wwtps which can severely affect the microbiota of wastewater treatment systems studying the effects of long term antibiotic exposure on ecosystems and microbiomes can provide important insights into the mechanisms involved in microbial adaptation to antibiotics in turn this could allow for the development of strategies to preserve the stability of bioreactors when treating antibiotic contaminated wastewater however limited studies had previously explored the microbial response mechanisms to antibiotics in biological wastewater treatment systems especially in a sulfate reducing sludge system here we evaluated the effects of long term ciprofloxacin a commonly prescribed antibiotic exposure on the microbial response mechanisms in a sulfate reducing sludge system using a metagenomic analysis approach surprisingly long term ciprofloxacin exposure substantially improved toc removal and sulfate reduction indicating that the microbes adjusted to the condition changes induced by ciprofloxacin and maintained the system s stability based on the microbial analysis results ciprofloxacin markedly affected the microbial community structure of the reactor in the ciprofloxacin exposed treatments there was a significant enrichment of genera with high tolerance to ciprofloxacin that were involved in carbon and sulfur conversion e g desulfobacter geobacter etc thus these microorganisms became dominant during the long term ciprofloxacin exposure furthermore a variety of strategies were also used by the microorganisms to cope with ciprofloxacin induced stress as illustrated in fig 7 first the ciprofloxacin stress message was rapidly conveyed through a signaling pathway involving ribosomal proteins e g rpl11 and rpl5 golomb et al 2014 as demonstrated by an up regulation of functional genes coding for ribosomal proteins upon exposure to ciprofloxacin fig s6 subsequently the microbial multiple response systems were activated for instance the antibiotic resistance mediated sos response was activated to reduce the cell damage induced by ciprofloxacin with the up regulation of multi drug efflux genes i e abc type rnd type and mfs type efflux genes fig 3 most intracellular ciprofloxacin was transported to the extracellular matrix via the efflux pump system which reduced the cell damage caused by ciprofloxacin accumulation piddock 2006 moreover the increase in eps production stimulated biofilm formation fig s7 which can block the entrance of antibiotics e g ciprofloxacin into the cell by tightly binding with the antibiotics and degrading them thereafter donlan 2002 these results were consistent with the findings of our previous study zhang et al 2018 furthermore some intracellular ciprofloxacin could be degraded into less toxic organic compounds by non specific enzymes e g dehydrogenase and monooxygenase secreted by microorganisms our findings indicated that the abundance of genes encoding dehydrogenase and monooxygenase increased by 4 33 fold in the presence of ciprofloxacin additionally the related degradation intermediates of ciprofloxacin were observed in our previous studies jia et al 2019 suggesting that some non specific enzymes e g dehydrogenase and monooxygenase played important roles in ciprofloxacin degradation fang et al 2021 the dna repair system was also activated in response to the dna damage caused by ciprofloxacin exposure for example the functional gene encoding the dna repair endonuclease rps3 jang et al 2004 was significantly up regulated under ciprofloxacin stress fig s6 the response against exogenous stress e g ciprofloxacin in microorganisms requires energy atp and electron donors e g nadh which are produced via carbon metabolism bui et al 2017 our findings indicated that ciprofloxacin stress induced an increase in atp nadh electron donor and cytochrome c which plays important roles in electron transport as well as related functional genes fig s8 these findings indicated that ciprofloxacin substantially promoted energy generation and electron transport in turn these results suggested that ciprofloxacin exposure stimulated carbon metabolism to enhance energy production which was further confirmed by the up regulation of key genes involved in carbon metabolism including glycerol catabolism pyruvate metabolism and the tca cycle fig 4 key genes involved in sulfur metabolism were also highly up regulated under ciprofloxacin stress fig 5 suggesting that ciprofloxacin stimulated sulfur metabolism the intermediates of carbon metabolism e g acetate mono and di carboxylic aliphatic acids alcohols polar aromatic compounds and even hydrocarbons can be utilized as electron donors by srb rabus et al 2013 previous studies have reported the similar microbial response that high concentration of ciprofloxacin induced stress e g 10 mg l stimulated the metabolism of microorganisms in activated sludge system including carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism indicating that microbes have formed a special metabolic pattern to maintain good cellular activity and increase their resistance to ciprofloxacin chen et al 2021 however lu et al 2019 found that microorganisms including eukaryotes and prokaryotes in freshwater generated different responses to ciprofloxacin in metabolism e g the strengthening of the two component regulatory system and enhancing the production of antitoxin against ciprofloxacin stress interestingly ciprofloxacin exposure resulted in a decrease in the competition index and an increase in the complementarity index fig s10 this result suggested that a cooperative alliance was established between microorganisms under long term ciprofloxacin stress which was further confirmed by the reconstructed metabolic network using the netseed model this means that the microorganisms in the sulfate reducing sludge system tended to cooperate rather than compete under exogenous ciprofloxacin stress furthermore the species that exhibited the highest levels of cooperation in the microbial community with higher complementarity index see table s5 for details became dominant due to their outstanding ability for synergistic carbon and sulfur metabolism and protective mechanisms against ciprofloxacin collectively our findings demonstrated that long term ciprofloxacin exposure triggered the sos response of the microorganisms in the sulfate reducing sludge system this activated the efflux and degradation of ciprofloxacin and stimulated the energy intensive carbon and sulfur metabolism to increase the resistance against ciprofloxacin these above findings can provide insight into the microbial response mechanisms to ciprofloxacin thus can provide a basis for the development of strategies to preserve the stability of sulfate reducing sludge system when treating ciprofloxacin contaminated wastewater 5 conclusion our study elucidated the effect of ciprofloxacin on the performance and microbial community of an anaerobic sulfate reducing bioreactor and the microbial response to ciprofloxacin was comprehensively investigated by metagenomics analysis our findings indicated that ciprofloxacin shaped the microbial community resulting in the enrichment of functional genera involved in carbon and sulfur metabolisms which were outstanding in ciprofloxacin defense based on our metagenomics analyses ciprofloxacin induced the microbial sos response including the efflux pump and degradation of ciprofloxacin and dna repair additionally ciprofloxacin stimulated carbon sulfur and amino acid metabolism to increase microbial resistance against ciprofloxacin by promoting energy generation and biofilm formation interestingly the microbes in the sulfate reducing sludge system tended to cooperate rather than compete under long term ciprofloxacin exposure as demonstrated by reverse ecology analysis using the revecor software the species with high complementarity indices protected each other against ciprofloxacin stress and therefore became dominant in the sulfate reducing sludge under long term ciprofloxacin stress in this study we characterized the response mechanisms of microorganisms to ciprofloxacin at the genetic

15587,nutrient removal in carbon limited wastewater with high efficiency and energy saving remains a bottleneck for wastewater treatment plants wwtps this study established a pilot scale anaerobic aerobic anoxic aoa system with processing capacity of 100 m3 d for the first time during almost 300 days of stable operation enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal at a c n of 5 was achieved and the concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in effluent were 3 60 1 55 and 0 24 0 13 mg l tetrasphaera and candidatus competibacter were the dominant phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in the aoa system moreover the low phosphorus release ensured sufficient intracellular carbon storage by endogenous denitrification which was the critical factor for nitrogen and phosphorus removal in carbon limited wastewater the denitrification phosphorus removal dpr ability further removed phosphorus and prevented secondary phosphorus release to maintain a low phosphorus concentration in effluent finally rapid start up high nutrient removal efficiency and low energy consumption make the proposed aoa process suitable for application in newly constructed and renovated wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pilot scale endogenous denitrification anaerobic aerobic anoxic simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorous carbon and energy saving data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction stringent discharge quality standards of wastewater treatment plants wwtps can help to reduce the release of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants to the water environment and prevent surface water bodies from eutrophication li et al 2022 yu et al 2019 without limitation by internal recycling ratio the post denitrification process can theoretically achieve complete nitrogen removal with sufficient carbon sources gao et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 however external carbon sources are lacking in the post denitrification process additional external carbon sources will increase reagent cost and greenhouse gas emission risk bao et al 2016 wang et al 2017a intracellular carbon sources including poly β hydroxy alkanoates phas and glycogen gly are considered feasible to endogenous denitrification lu et al 2021 mcilroy et al 2014 vocks et al 2005 zeng et al 2003b additionally endogenous denitrification in the post anoxic zone of municipal wwtps has been found to contribute significantly to increasing the nitrogen removal efficiency li et al 2022 liu et al 2021 therefore the development and utilization of intracellular carbon sources provide a possibility for enhancing nitrogen removal in wwtps a novel anaerobic aerobic anoxic aoa process has been proposed gao et al 2020 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 and it was found that feast famine cycling is beneficial for endogenous denitrification via enhancing the storage and utilization of intracellular carbon sources bernat et al 2008 endogenous denitrification is driven by glycogen accumulating organisms gaos with denitrification function ji et al 2020 previous studies have shown that above 80 of external carbon sources contained in wastewater are sufficiently stored by gaos in an anaerobic zone feast period ji et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in post anoxic zones famine period more than 85 nitrogen removal efficiency is achieved via endogenous denitrification to reduce the nitrate and nitrite produced from the aerobic zone miao et al 2016 winkler et al 2011 efficient wastewater treatment with low c n ratios 1 4 further demonstrated the advantages of the aoa process for nitrogen removal in carbon limited wastewater gao et al 2022 zhao et al 2019 except for the decomposition and composition of intracellular poly phosphate ploy p the carbon metabolism pathway of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos is similar to that of gaos lanham et al 2014 oehmen et al 2007 therefore the feast famine cycling in the aoa process is also conducive to phosphorus removal liu et al 2019 oehmen et al 2007 the competition between paos and gaos for limited carbon sources impacts nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance chen et al 2022 rubio rincon et al 2017 studies have proposed that advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal can be achieved by balancing paos and gaos in laboratory scale aoa systems under certain conditions zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 however achieving the balance between paos and gaos is more difficult in practical engineering due to the seasonal temperature variations and dynamic carbon source concentration and composition of actual municipal wastewater chen et al 2022 song et al 2022 wang et al 2015 moreover only a few strategies are available to control these factors after scaling up the process thus optimization and improvement in the pilot scale experiments are needed before being generalized for the full scale wwtps in this study a pilot scale aoa process with a daily processing capacity of 100 m3 was established the feasibility of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal during the long term operation was evaluated the nitrogen and phosphorus removal mechanism in the pilot scale aoa process was revealed through the variations of nutrient concentration in different zones combined with batch tests and analysis of microbial community and abundance the balance of nitrogen and phosphorus efficient removal in aoa system under carbon limitation was explored finally based on the results of the aao wwtp with same influent as the pilot the advantages of the aoa process for practical application were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of the pilot scale aoa system a pilot scale continuous flow reactor fig s1 a was established including a bioreactor with 54 m3 working volume and a secondary sedimentation tank with 27 m3 working volume the bioreactor was divided into anaerobic aerobic and anoxic zones from the influent direction two sludge recirculations were applied from the secondary sedimentation tank to the front of anaerobic zone r1 and anoxic zone r2 and their amount was equal to the inflow the hydraulic retention time hrt was 10 8 h including anaerobic stage for 2 7 h aerobic stage for 2 7 h and anoxic stage for 5 4 h the dissolved oxygen do in the aerobic zone was controlled at 1 5 1 0 mg l on average 1 m3 d of sludge was discharged from the bottom of the secondary sedimentary tank and the sludge retention time srt was about 25 30 d the activated sludge of the pilot scale aoa system was obtained from the baisamen wwtp hainan china text 1 the actual municipal wastewater was collected from the effluent of the grit chamber of baisamen wwtp the quality of the influent water fluctuated with the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of 100 300 mg l and salinity of 1000 2000 mg l the temperature was 22 33 c during system operation 2 2 batch experiments 2 2 1 batch test of denitrifying phosphorus removal on days 90 125 and 180 of the pilot scale aoa system operation the activated sludge was collected to carry out the batch tests of denitrification phosphorus removal dpr the municipal wastewater was added to the activated sludge with the final chemical oxygen demand cod of about 150 mg l and anaerobic stirring was carried out for 3 h then the activated sludge was washed three times with deionized water and flushed with n2 to remove dissolved substances and oxygen do 0 1 mg l subsequently the h3po4 15 mg l and nano3 20 mg l were supplied in the batch test the temperature was controlled at 30 c and mlss was 4000 500 mg l the effective volume of anoxic anaerobic fig s1 c batch experiments was 500 ml 2 2 2 determination of long term endogenous denitrification activity the endogenous denitrification activity was determined by a specific nitrate removal rate and measured approximately every two months first the municipal wastewater was added to the activated sludge with the final cod of about 150 mg l and anaerobic stirring was carried out for 3 h then after washing thrice with deionized water and 15 min flushing with n2 the mixture was supplied with nano3 20 mg l the other operating conditions were the same as the batch tests in 2 2 1 2 3 methods for chemical analysis the samples of the pilot scale aoa process were collected and analyzed in situ after 30 min standing to remove the suspended solids the activated sludge for the batch test was mailed to the laboratory beijing china and this sample was analyzed in the laboratory the mailing process took three days cod was measured by a cod quick analysis apparatus hach company usa the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were analyzed according to standard methods apha 1998 do and temperature were monitored using an endress hauser online instrument endress hauser company germany the freeze dried biomass was taken from different zones for measurement of intracellular carbon sources phas were determined by the sum of poly b hydroxy butyrate phb and poly b hydroxy valerate phv which were monitored by a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a oehmen et al 2005 gly was analyzed by the anthrone method zeng et al 2003a 2 4 quantification of paos and gaos the sludge samples were collected on the 80th day of system operation and then sampled about every month the genetic material was extracted using the fast dna spin kits for soil bio 101 usa following the manufacturer s protocol after extraction a nanodrop nd 2000 thermo fisher scientific usa was used to determine the concentration and quality of the dna samples quantitative pcr qpcr was performed to quantify the abundance using an mx3005p qpcr system agilent technologies usa with sybr premix extaq takara china the primers for paos and gaos are shown in table s1 2 5 high throughput sequencing analysis two groups of sludge samples 3 parallels per group were collected on days 60 and 350 in the pilot scale aoa system to investigate the variations of microbial community bacterial 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified with primers table s1 targeting the v3 and v4 regions dennis et al 2013 sequencing of amplicons from all the samples was conducted on the illumina miseq platform by guangzhou omicshare biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china the raw sequencing data were processed by qiime v1 9 1 with sequence grouping according to operational taxonomic units otus and 97 identity thresholds using uparse 7 0 1090 caporaso et al 2010 and classified using the silva bacteria database bremen germany all the raw sequences were archived at the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number prjna847407 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance in pilot scale aoa system 3 1 1 nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency in long term operation the long term nutrient removal performance of the pilot scale aoa system is shown in fig 1 in the first 10 days the concentrations of tn and nh4 n in the effluent fluctuated significantly and the tn removal efficiency was below 80 during 11 130 days the nh4 n removal efficiency remained at 96 55 3 32 while the tn concentration in the effluent was reduced to below 10 mg l and showed a gradual decreasing trend the rapid start up of the aoa system was completed within 10 days and the nitrogen removal was enhanced in the subsequent 100 days of operation then long term stable and efficient nitrogen removal was achieved on days 131 400 during this period the tn concentration in the influent fluctuated between 7 63 41 01 mg l 25 72 mg l on average while tn concentration in the effluent was stable at 3 57 1 58 mg l the average nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies were 94 19 and 85 86 respectively as shown in fig 1 c the influent concentration of cod 262 43 mg l changed greatly as well as the c n ratio 1 7 9 5 during the stable nitrogen removal period from 132 to 400 days the effluent cod concentration was 25 75 9 76 mg l with an average c n of 5 04 it is worth noting that the available cod was limited only 100 42 mg l was removed and soluble cod accounted for 50 80 data not shown the tp concentration in the influent also fluctuated greatly 0 39 8 95 mg l due to the unstable phosphorus release in the grit chamber before feeding in the aoa system the effluent tp concentration was stable at 0 24 0 13 mg l and the average tp removal efficiency was 90 40 the above results indicated that the pilot scale aoa process achieved long term stable and efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal from carbon limited municipal wastewater furthermore the rapid start up of the aoa system was completed within 10 days the tn removal was enhanced and tp removal was more stable in the subsequent 100 days of operation 3 1 2 activity and abundance variation of paos and gaos in long term operation endogenous denitrification activity is characterized by a specific no3 n removal rate under the anoxic stage as shown in fig 2 endogenous denitrification activity increased gradually with the system operation and reached 1 45 mgn gvss h on day 350 which was within the range of 0 2 2 1 mgn gvss h reported by previous studies on the laboratory scale coats et al 2011 ding et al 2022 gao et al 2022 klapwijk 1999 in addition gaos and paos increased from 2 45 108 to 2 98 109 and from 8 34 108 to 9 51 109 copies gss within 80 180 days which indicated that the aoa system was beneficial to the enrichment of the intracellular carbon source accumulating microorganisms during 180 395 days the abundance of gaos and paos remained at 2 90 5 26 109 and 9 49 4 34 109 copies gss respectively paos and gaos were first enriched and stabilized in the system which was consistent with the variations of nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency in the aoa system the increase in abundance of gaos and endogenous denitrification activity were the main reasons for the enhancement of tn removal and the maintenance of the paos and gaos was beneficial to the stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 2 nitrogen and phosphorus removal mechanism in pilot scale aoa system 3 2 1 stoichiometry based evaluations of cooperation and competition between gaos and paos in order to understand the cooperation and competition between gaos and paos the nutrient and intracellular carbon transformation stoichiometries of the different zones during 362 385d were calculated fig 3 and table s2 in the anaerobic zones the cod removed was 51 28 mg l accounting for 86 7 of the total cod removed in pilot scale aoa system apart from the cod consumed by denitrification 7 94 eq s1 large amount of cod in anaerobic zone was still removed which was possibly through the intracellular carbon source storage by paos and gaos the δphas δcod ratio 1 38 molc molc at the anaerobic zone of the system was between that of the paos model 1 33 molc molc and the gaos model 1 85 molc molc ding et al 2022 zeng et al 2003b the δgly δcod ratio was 4 23 molc molc which was far higher than 0 5 molc molc of paos model and 1 12 molc molc of gaos model wang et al 2016a it is speculated that gly was over decomposed to supplement energy and acetyl coa required for phas synthesis under carbon limited conditions mcilroy et al 2014 in addition 0 12 mmolp l po4 3 p release could synthesize 0 24 mmolc l phas smolders et al 1994 accounting for 19 8 of the total phas production the above results showed that both paos and gaos stored intracellular carbon sources in anaerobic zone and gaos played a dominant role 62 7 eq s1 in this process in the aerobic zone δp δphas ratio of 0 16 molp molc was far lower than that of aerobic paos model 0 41 molp molc and similar to that of denitrifying paos model 0 16 0 24 molp molc wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2019 additional consumption of phas due to gly synthesized by gaos was the possible reason for the low ratio this also showed that denitrifying paos likely contributed to phosphorus removal in the aerobic zone in thw anoxic zone the concentration of pha and gly decreased while the cod concentration was maintained indicating nitrate reduction via endogenous denitrification gao et al 2020 ji et al 2018 according to the stoichiometries of denitrifying paos po4 3 p uptake amount in the anoxic zone could only remove 0 004 mmoln l nitrate wang et al 2016a moreover δphas 0 10 mmolc l was much less than δgly 6 98 mmolc l therefore the nitrate removal in anoxic zone was mainly through gaos and driven by gly 3 2 2 simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal by balancing intracellular carbon storage as shown in fig 3 the tn removal in the pilot scale aoa system was mainly in anoxic zones by endogenous denitrification accounting for 57 24 the tn loss in aerobic zones accounted for 31 00 which was likely through the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd the snd rate was higher in the pilot scale aoa system when do was controlled at 1 5 mg l under carbon limitation and remaining mlvss at 2796 641 mg l fig s2 the linear fitting showed the positive relationship between codintra and snd rate fig s3 which indicated that sufficient storage of intracellular carbon sources was the main reason for the enhanced snd rate qin et al 2005 third et al 2005 vocks et al 2005 wang et al 2017b therefore the abundant storage of intracellular carbon sources by gaos was the key to nitrogen removal in the pre anaerobic zone the low tn concentration in the recirculated sludge would consume a small amount of carbon source via denitrification it is worth noting that the phosphorus release amount 3 76 mg l and rate 0 31 mg gss h were low compared with the ebpr system e g 3 0 13 6 mg gss h in chinese wwtps chen et al 2022 8 15 mg gss h in danish wwtps mielczarek et al 2013 and 9 6 20 9 mg gss h in dutch wwtps lopez vazquez et al 2008 long term operating temperature higher than 25 c is unfavorable for paos to compete with gaos for carbon storage in the anaerobic zone qiu et al 2022 zhao 2012 less carbon source storage led to a small amount of ploy p decomposition however more carbon sources can be stored by gaos for denitrification to enhance nitrogen removal therefore the low phosphorus release was beneficial for balancing the intracellular carbon storage to achieve simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal in carbon limited wastewater treatment 3 2 3 maintenance of low phosphorus concentration by drp ability the phosphorus removal in the pilot scale aoa system was mainly through the phosphorus uptake in the aerobic stage which accounted for 99 7 fig 3 in other words a small amount of phosphorus was removed in the post anoxic zone furthermore the batch tests showed that phosphorus was released without nitrate fig 4 a and b in the post anoxic stage such as the secondary sedimentation tank the uncertainty of secondary phosphorus release is a key factor responsible for unstable phosphorus removal in wwtps mikola et al 2009 as shown in fig 4 c dpr was observed in the presence of both nitrate and phosphorus the dpr ability can contribute to phosphorus removal and ensure low phosphorus concentration in the long term post anoxic stage of the aoa system the nitrate removal rate remained unchanged without additional phosphorus fig 4 d indicating that dpr ability did not affect the nitrogen removal in the aoa system 3 3 microbial communities in pilot scale aoa system on the 60th and 350th days of the aoa system operation the sludge samples were also collected for high throughput sequencing anova results showed that there was no significant change in the richness and diversity of microbial community simpson p 0 01 and chao p 0 05 with system operation table s3 as shown in fig 5 c the dominant phylum changed from proteobacteria to actinobacteria with system operation proteobacteria including denitrifying bacteria dnb are a common phylum of the activated sludge in wwtps gong et al 2020 in the aoa pilot system five genera belonging to paos were detected including tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas candidatus microthrix and pseudonocardia fig 5 d the relative abundance of paos increased from 0 26 to 0 75 with the system operation and the variation trend was similar to qpcr results it has been reported that tetrasphaera used ample molecular carbon organics for fermentation without releasing phosphorus and supplying vfas to paos and gaos liu et al 2019 candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas are reported to have dpr ability du et al 2019 liu et al 2019 therefore the dominance of bacteria tetrasphaera and the existence of candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas in the system might be the key to achieving a low amount of phosphorus release and stable phosphorus removal performance candidatus competibacter and defluviicoccus are typical gaos involved in endogenous denitrification du et al 2019 the relative abundance of these two genera was slightly decreased from 3 38 to 2 78 the variations of gaos were inconsistent with pcr results furthermore the ratio of gaos paos was 3 11 significantly higher than the pcr results 0 3 on average so far the pcr primers used in determination of paos and gaos only include some species or strains crocetti et al 2002 he et al 2007 oehmen et al 2007 this might be the reason for the different results from the relative abundance at the genus level via high throughput sequencing however a high gaos paos ratio is beneficial for gaos in the competition of intracellular carbon source storage to enhance nitrogen removal zhao et al 2019 one genus each of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were detected namely nitrosomonas and nitrosospira the relative abundance of aob and nob decreased which might be related to the shorter aerobic retention time in the aoa system compared with traditional aao processes this was consistent with the slight reduction of nh4 n removal efficiency fig 1 b finally fifteen common dnb were detected in the aoa system the relative abundance of dnb decreased due to enhancement of endogenous denitrification and the nitrate for exogenous denitrification was also decreased 3 4 feasibility analysis of aoa process application 3 4 1 stable and efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficient and stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal was achieved in almost 300 days with the tn and tp removal efficiencies of 85 29 and 91 82 in aao wwtp the tn and tp removal efficiencies were 62 82 and 91 19 with the same influent as the pilot scale aoa system table s4 the theoretical maximum tn removal efficiency of aao wwtp is 66 67 at the sludge recirculation ratio of 50 and the nitrifying liquid reflux ratio of 150 li et al 2019 the theoretical and practical nitrogen removal efficiencies of the aao system were significantly lower than those of the aoa system moreover the effluent tp concentration in wwtp was also slightly higher than that in the aoa system after adding 30 kg d of flocculants therefore as an advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal process the application of aoa can improve the removal efficiency of traditional wwtps 3 4 2 rapid start up with wwtps activated sludge rapid start up within 10 days was achieved in the pilot scale aoa system sixteen unique genera existed in the aoa system with the relative abundances below 0 01 fig 5 b indicating that the microorganisms in the aoa system especially gaos and paos chen et al 2022 were prevalent in the activated sludge of the wwtps this was the main reason for the rapid start up and demonstrated suitability of the aoa process for application in new construction the principal components analysis pca at otu level fig 5 a and the analysis of upgam cluster dendrogram at genus level fig s4 showed that aao and aoa samples were clustered together on day 350 the similar microbial community of the two processes indicated that the aao process will be easily upgraded and renovated to the aoa process to improve the removal efficiency 3 4 3 effective utilization of carbon and energy saving the cod removal in the aoa system was mainly in the anaerobic zone accounting for 86 7 fig 3 reducing the carbon source consumption in aerobic zone is conducive to nitrogen and phosphorus removal and saves the do requirement for cod removal therefore the aerobic retention time in the pilot scale aoa system was only 2 7 h accounting for 25 of hrt generally the aerobic retention time in aao process accounts for about 50 of the hrt li et al 2019 wang et al 2006 wang et al 2016b zhou et al 2015 and the aerobic retention time in aao wwtp was 6 7 h assuming that the aoa and aao systems have the same scale the energy consumption was calculated according to eq s2 the results showed that the aoa system energy consumption was 60 of the aao system energy consumption therefore compared with the aao process the aoa system exhibited the advantages of fully utilizing influent carbon sources and saving energy 4 conclusion stable and efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal was achieved in a pilot scale aoa system with a daily treatment capacity of 100 m3 the dpr ability ensured low tp concentration of 0 24 0 13 mg l in the effluent after the long term post

15587,nutrient removal in carbon limited wastewater with high efficiency and energy saving remains a bottleneck for wastewater treatment plants wwtps this study established a pilot scale anaerobic aerobic anoxic aoa system with processing capacity of 100 m3 d for the first time during almost 300 days of stable operation enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal at a c n of 5 was achieved and the concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in effluent were 3 60 1 55 and 0 24 0 13 mg l tetrasphaera and candidatus competibacter were the dominant phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in the aoa system moreover the low phosphorus release ensured sufficient intracellular carbon storage by endogenous denitrification which was the critical factor for nitrogen and phosphorus removal in carbon limited wastewater the denitrification phosphorus removal dpr ability further removed phosphorus and prevented secondary phosphorus release to maintain a low phosphorus concentration in effluent finally rapid start up high nutrient removal efficiency and low energy consumption make the proposed aoa process suitable for application in newly constructed and renovated wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pilot scale endogenous denitrification anaerobic aerobic anoxic simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorous carbon and energy saving data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction stringent discharge quality standards of wastewater treatment plants wwtps can help to reduce the release of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants to the water environment and prevent surface water bodies from eutrophication li et al 2022 yu et al 2019 without limitation by internal recycling ratio the post denitrification process can theoretically achieve complete nitrogen removal with sufficient carbon sources gao et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 however external carbon sources are lacking in the post denitrification process additional external carbon sources will increase reagent cost and greenhouse gas emission risk bao et al 2016 wang et al 2017a intracellular carbon sources including poly β hydroxy alkanoates phas and glycogen gly are considered feasible to endogenous denitrification lu et al 2021 mcilroy et al 2014 vocks et al 2005 zeng et al 2003b additionally endogenous denitrification in the post anoxic zone of municipal wwtps has been found to contribute significantly to increasing the nitrogen removal efficiency li et al 2022 liu et al 2021 therefore the development and utilization of intracellular carbon sources provide a possibility for enhancing nitrogen removal in wwtps a novel anaerobic aerobic anoxic aoa process has been proposed gao et al 2020 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 and it was found that feast famine cycling is beneficial for endogenous denitrification via enhancing the storage and utilization of intracellular carbon sources bernat et al 2008 endogenous denitrification is driven by glycogen accumulating organisms gaos with denitrification function ji et al 2020 previous studies have shown that above 80 of external carbon sources contained in wastewater are sufficiently stored by gaos in an anaerobic zone feast period ji et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in post anoxic zones famine period more than 85 nitrogen removal efficiency is achieved via endogenous denitrification to reduce the nitrate and nitrite produced from the aerobic zone miao et al 2016 winkler et al 2011 efficient wastewater treatment with low c n ratios 1 4 further demonstrated the advantages of the aoa process for nitrogen removal in carbon limited wastewater gao et al 2022 zhao et al 2019 except for the decomposition and composition of intracellular poly phosphate ploy p the carbon metabolism pathway of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos is similar to that of gaos lanham et al 2014 oehmen et al 2007 therefore the feast famine cycling in the aoa process is also conducive to phosphorus removal liu et al 2019 oehmen et al 2007 the competition between paos and gaos for limited carbon sources impacts nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance chen et al 2022 rubio rincon et al 2017 studies have proposed that advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal can be achieved by balancing paos and gaos in laboratory scale aoa systems under certain conditions zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 however achieving the balance between paos and gaos is more difficult in practical engineering due to the seasonal temperature variations and dynamic carbon source concentration and composition of actual municipal wastewater chen et al 2022 song et al 2022 wang et al 2015 moreover only a few strategies are available to control these factors after scaling up the process thus optimization and improvement in the pilot scale experiments are needed before being generalized for the full scale wwtps in this study a pilot scale aoa process with a daily processing capacity of 100 m3 was established the feasibility of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal during the long term operation was evaluated the nitrogen and phosphorus removal mechanism in the pilot scale aoa process was revealed through the variations of nutrient concentration in different zones combined with batch tests and analysis of microbial community and abundance the balance of nitrogen and phosphorus efficient removal in aoa system under carbon limitation was explored finally based on the results of the aao wwtp with same influent as the pilot the advantages of the aoa process for practical application were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of the pilot scale aoa system a pilot scale continuous flow reactor fig s1 a was established including a bioreactor with 54 m3 working volume and a secondary sedimentation tank with 27 m3 working volume the bioreactor was divided into anaerobic aerobic and anoxic zones from the influent direction two sludge recirculations were applied from the secondary sedimentation tank to the front of anaerobic zone r1 and anoxic zone r2 and their amount was equal to the inflow the hydraulic retention time hrt was 10 8 h including anaerobic stage for 2 7 h aerobic stage for 2 7 h and anoxic stage for 5 4 h the dissolved oxygen do in the aerobic zone was controlled at 1 5 1 0 mg l on average 1 m3 d of sludge was discharged from the bottom of the secondary sedimentary tank and the sludge retention time srt was about 25 30 d the activated sludge of the pilot scale aoa system was obtained from the baisamen wwtp hainan china text 1 the actual municipal wastewater was collected from the effluent of the grit chamber of baisamen wwtp the quality of the influent water fluctuated with the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of 100 300 mg l and salinity of 1000 2000 mg l the temperature was 22 33 c during system operation 2 2 batch experiments 2 2 1 batch test of denitrifying phosphorus removal on days 90 125 and 180 of the pilot scale aoa system operation the activated sludge was collected to carry out the batch tests of denitrification phosphorus removal dpr the municipal wastewater was added to the activated sludge with the final chemical oxygen demand cod of about 150 mg l and anaerobic stirring was carried out for 3 h then the activated sludge was washed three times with deionized water and flushed with n2 to remove dissolved substances and oxygen do 0 1 mg l subsequently the h3po4 15 mg l and nano3 20 mg l were supplied in the batch test the temperature was controlled at 30 c and mlss was 4000 500 mg l the effective volume of anoxic anaerobic fig s1 c batch experiments was 500 ml 2 2 2 determination of long term endogenous denitrification activity the endogenous denitrification activity was determined by a specific nitrate removal rate and measured approximately every two months first the municipal wastewater was added to the activated sludge with the final cod of about 150 mg l and anaerobic stirring was carried out for 3 h then after washing thrice with deionized water and 15 min flushing with n2 the mixture was supplied with nano3 20 mg l the other operating conditions were the same as the batch tests in 2 2 1 2 3 methods for chemical analysis the samples of the pilot scale aoa process were collected and analyzed in situ after 30 min standing to remove the suspended solids the activated sludge for the batch test was mailed to the laboratory beijing china and this sample was analyzed in the laboratory the mailing process took three days cod was measured by a cod quick analysis apparatus hach company usa the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were analyzed according to standard methods apha 1998 do and temperature were monitored using an endress hauser online instrument endress hauser company germany the freeze dried biomass was taken from different zones for measurement of intracellular carbon sources phas were determined by the sum of poly b hydroxy butyrate phb and poly b hydroxy valerate phv which were monitored by a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a oehmen et al 2005 gly was analyzed by the anthrone method zeng et al 2003a 2 4 quantification of paos and gaos the sludge samples were collected on the 80th day of system operation and then sampled about every month the genetic material was extracted using the fast dna spin kits for soil bio 101 usa following the manufacturer s protocol after extraction a nanodrop nd 2000 thermo fisher scientific usa was used to determine the concentration and quality of the dna samples quantitative pcr qpcr was performed to quantify the abundance using an mx3005p qpcr system agilent technologies usa with sybr premix extaq takara china the primers for paos and gaos are shown in table s1 2 5 high throughput sequencing analysis two groups of sludge samples 3 parallels per group were collected on days 60 and 350 in the pilot scale aoa system to investigate the variations of microbial community bacterial 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified with primers table s1 targeting the v3 and v4 regions dennis et al 2013 sequencing of amplicons from all the samples was conducted on the illumina miseq platform by guangzhou omicshare biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china the raw sequencing data were processed by qiime v1 9 1 with sequence grouping according to operational taxonomic units otus and 97 identity thresholds using uparse 7 0 1090 caporaso et al 2010 and classified using the silva bacteria database bremen germany all the raw sequences were archived at the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number prjna847407 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance in pilot scale aoa system 3 1 1 nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency in long term operation the long term nutrient removal performance of the pilot scale aoa system is shown in fig 1 in the first 10 days the concentrations of tn and nh4 n in the effluent fluctuated significantly and the tn removal efficiency was below 80 during 11 130 days the nh4 n removal efficiency remained at 96 55 3 32 while the tn concentration in the effluent was reduced to below 10 mg l and showed a gradual decreasing trend the rapid start up of the aoa system was completed within 10 days and the nitrogen removal was enhanced in the subsequent 100 days of operation then long term stable and efficient nitrogen removal was achieved on days 131 400 during this period the tn concentration in the influent fluctuated between 7 63 41 01 mg l 25 72 mg l on average while tn concentration in the effluent was stable at 3 57 1 58 mg l the average nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies were 94 19 and 85 86 respectively as shown in fig 1 c the influent concentration of cod 262 43 mg l changed greatly as well as the c n ratio 1 7 9 5 during the stable nitrogen removal period from 132 to 400 days the effluent cod concentration was 25 75 9 76 mg l with an average c n of 5 04 it is worth noting that the available cod was limited only 100 42 mg l was removed and soluble cod accounted for 50 80 data not shown the tp concentration in the influent also fluctuated greatly 0 39 8 95 mg l due to the unstable phosphorus release in the grit chamber before feeding in the aoa system the effluent tp concentration was stable at 0 24 0 13 mg l and the average tp removal efficiency was 90 40 the above results indicated that the pilot scale aoa process achieved long term stable and efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal from carbon limited municipal wastewater furthermore the rapid start up of the aoa system was completed within 10 days the tn removal was enhanced and tp removal was more stable in the subsequent 100 days of operation 3 1 2 activity and abundance variation of paos and gaos in long term operation endogenous denitrification activity is characterized by a specific no3 n removal rate under the anoxic stage as shown in fig 2 endogenous denitrification activity increased gradually with the system operation and reached 1 45 mgn gvss h on day 350 which was within the range of 0 2 2 1 mgn gvss h reported by previous studies on the laboratory scale coats et al 2011 ding et al 2022 gao et al 2022 klapwijk 1999 in addition gaos and paos increased from 2 45 108 to 2 98 109 and from 8 34 108 to 9 51 109 copies gss within 80 180 days which indicated that the aoa system was beneficial to the enrichment of the intracellular carbon source accumulating microorganisms during 180 395 days the abundance of gaos and paos remained at 2 90 5 26 109 and 9 49 4 34 109 copies gss respectively paos and gaos were first enriched and stabilized in the system which was consistent with the variations of nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency in the aoa system the increase in abundance of gaos and endogenous denitrification activity were the main reasons for the enhancement of tn removal and the maintenance of the paos and gaos was beneficial to the stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 2 nitrogen and phosphorus removal mechanism in pilot scale aoa system 3 2 1 stoichiometry based evaluations of cooperation and competition between gaos and paos in order to understand the cooperation and competition between gaos and paos the nutrient and intracellular carbon transformation stoichiometries of the different zones during 362 385d were calculated fig 3 and table s2 in the anaerobic zones the cod removed was 51 28 mg l accounting for 86 7 of the total cod removed in pilot scale aoa system apart from the cod consumed by denitrification 7 94 eq s1 large amount of cod in anaerobic zone was still removed which was possibly through the intracellular carbon source storage by paos and gaos the δphas δcod ratio 1 38 molc molc at the anaerobic zone of the system was between that of the paos model 1 33 molc molc and the gaos model 1 85 molc molc ding et al 2022 zeng et al 2003b the δgly δcod ratio was 4 23 molc molc which was far higher than 0 5 molc molc of paos model and 1 12 molc molc of gaos model wang et al 2016a it is speculated that gly was over decomposed to supplement energy and acetyl coa required for phas synthesis under carbon limited conditions mcilroy et al 2014 in addition 0 12 mmolp l po4 3 p release could synthesize 0 24 mmolc l phas smolders et al 1994 accounting for 19 8 of the total phas production the above results showed that both paos and gaos stored intracellular carbon sources in anaerobic zone and gaos played a dominant role 62 7 eq s1 in this process in the aerobic zone δp δphas ratio of 0 16 molp molc was far lower than that of aerobic paos model 0 41 molp molc and similar to that of denitrifying paos model 0 16 0 24 molp molc wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2019 additional consumption of phas due to gly synthesized by gaos was the possible reason for the low ratio this also showed that denitrifying paos likely contributed to phosphorus removal in the aerobic zone in thw anoxic zone the concentration of pha and gly decreased while the cod concentration was maintained indicating nitrate reduction via endogenous denitrification gao et al 2020 ji et al 2018 according to the stoichiometries of denitrifying paos po4 3 p uptake amount in the anoxic zone could only remove 0 004 mmoln l nitrate wang et al 2016a moreover δphas 0 10 mmolc l was much less than δgly 6 98 mmolc l therefore the nitrate removal in anoxic zone was mainly through gaos and driven by gly 3 2 2 simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal by balancing intracellular carbon storage as shown in fig 3 the tn removal in the pilot scale aoa system was mainly in anoxic zones by endogenous denitrification accounting for 57 24 the tn loss in aerobic zones accounted for 31 00 which was likely through the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd the snd rate was higher in the pilot scale aoa system when do was controlled at 1 5 mg l under carbon limitation and remaining mlvss at 2796 641 mg l fig s2 the linear fitting showed the positive relationship between codintra and snd rate fig s3 which indicated that sufficient storage of intracellular carbon sources was the main reason for the enhanced snd rate qin et al 2005 third et al 2005 vocks et al 2005 wang et al 2017b therefore the abundant storage of intracellular carbon sources by gaos was the key to nitrogen removal in the pre anaerobic zone the low tn concentration in the recirculated sludge would consume a small amount of carbon source via denitrification it is worth noting that the phosphorus release amount 3 76 mg l and rate 0 31 mg gss h were low compared with the ebpr system e g 3 0 13 6 mg gss h in chinese wwtps chen et al 2022 8 15 mg gss h in danish wwtps mielczarek et al 2013 and 9 6 20 9 mg gss h in dutch wwtps lopez vazquez et al 2008 long term operating temperature higher than 25 c is unfavorable for paos to compete with gaos for carbon storage in the anaerobic zone qiu et al 2022 zhao 2012 less carbon source storage led to a small amount of ploy p decomposition however more carbon sources can be stored by gaos for denitrification to enhance nitrogen removal therefore the low phosphorus release was beneficial for balancing the intracellular carbon storage to achieve simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal in carbon limited wastewater treatment 3 2 3 maintenance of low phosphorus concentration by drp ability the phosphorus removal in the pilot scale aoa system was mainly through the phosphorus uptake in the aerobic stage which accounted for 99 7 fig 3 in other words a small amount of phosphorus was removed in the post anoxic zone furthermore the batch tests showed that phosphorus was released without nitrate fig 4 a and b in the post anoxic stage such as the secondary sedimentation tank the uncertainty of secondary phosphorus release is a key factor responsible for unstable phosphorus removal in wwtps mikola et al 2009 as shown in fig 4 c dpr was observed in the presence of both nitrate and phosphorus the dpr ability can contribute to phosphorus removal and ensure low phosphorus concentration in the long term post anoxic stage of the aoa system the nitrate removal rate remained unchanged without additional phosphorus fig 4 d indicating that dpr ability did not affect the nitrogen removal in the aoa system 3 3 microbial communities in pilot scale aoa system on the 60th and 350th days of the aoa system operation the sludge samples were also collected for high throughput sequencing anova results showed that there was no significant change in the richness and diversity of microbial community simpson p 0 01 and chao p 0 05 with system operation table s3 as shown in fig 5 c the dominant phylum changed from proteobacteria to actinobacteria with system operation proteobacteria including denitrifying bacteria dnb are a common phylum of the activated sludge in wwtps gong et al 2020 in the aoa pilot system five genera belonging to paos were detected including tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas candidatus microthrix and pseudonocardia fig 5 d the relative abundance of paos increased from 0 26 to 0 75 with the system operation and the variation trend was similar to qpcr results it has been reported that tetrasphaera used ample molecular carbon organics for fermentation without releasing phosphorus and supplying vfas to paos and gaos liu et al 2019 candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas are reported to have dpr ability du et al 2019 liu et al 2019 therefore the dominance of bacteria tetrasphaera and the existence of candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas in the system might be the key to achieving a low amount of phosphorus release and stable phosphorus removal performance candidatus competibacter and defluviicoccus are typical gaos involved in endogenous denitrification du et al 2019 the relative abundance of these two genera was slightly decreased from 3 38 to 2 78 the variations of gaos were inconsistent with pcr results furthermore the ratio of gaos paos was 3 11 significantly higher than the pcr results 0 3 on average so far the pcr primers used in determination of paos and gaos only include some species or strains crocetti et al 2002 he et al 2007 oehmen et al 2007 this might be the reason for the different results from the relative abundance at the genus level via high throughput sequencing however a high gaos paos ratio is beneficial for gaos in the competition of intracellular carbon source storage to enhance nitrogen removal zhao et al 2019 one genus each of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were detected namely nitrosomonas and nitrosospira the relative abundance of aob and nob decreased which might be related to the shorter aerobic retention time in the aoa system compared with traditional aao processes this was consistent with the slight reduction of nh4 n removal efficiency fig 1 b finally fifteen common dnb were detected in the aoa system the relative abundance of dnb decreased due to enhancement of endogenous denitrification and the nitrate for exogenous denitrification was also decreased 3 4 feasibility analysis of aoa process application 3 4 1 stable and efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficient and stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal was achieved in almost 300 days with the tn and tp removal efficiencies of 85 29 and 91 82 in aao wwtp the tn and tp removal efficiencies were 62 82 and 91 19 with the same influent as the pilot scale aoa system table s4 the theoretical maximum tn removal efficiency of aao wwtp is 66 67 at the sludge recirculation ratio of 50 and the nitrifying liquid reflux ratio of 150 li et al 2019 the theoretical and practical nitrogen removal efficiencies of the aao system were significantly lower than those of the aoa system moreover the effluent tp concentration in wwtp was also slightly higher than that in the aoa system after adding 30 kg d of flocculants therefore as an advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal process the application of aoa can improve the removal efficiency of traditional wwtps 3 4 2 rapid start up with wwtps activated sludge rapid start up within 10 days was achieved in the pilot scale aoa system sixteen unique genera existed in the aoa system with the relative abundances below 0 01 fig 5 b indicating that the microorganisms in the aoa system especially gaos and paos chen et al 2022 were prevalent in the activated sludge of the wwtps this was the main reason for the rapid start up and demonstrated suitability of the aoa process for application in new construction the principal components analysis pca at otu level fig 5 a and the analysis of upgam cluster dendrogram at genus level fig s4 showed that aao and aoa samples were clustered together on day 350 the similar microbial community of the two processes indicated that the aao process will be easily upgraded and renovated to the aoa process to improve the removal efficiency 3 4 3 effective utilization of carbon and energy saving the cod removal in the aoa system was mainly in the anaerobic zone accounting for 86 7 fig 3 reducing the carbon source consumption in aerobic zone is conducive to nitrogen and phosphorus removal and saves the do requirement for cod removal therefore the aerobic retention time in the pilot scale aoa system was only 2 7 h accounting for 25 of hrt generally the aerobic retention time in aao process accounts for about 50 of the hrt li et al 2019 wang et al 2006 wang et al 2016b zhou et al 2015 and the aerobic retention time in aao wwtp was 6 7 h assuming that the aoa and aao systems have the same scale the energy consumption was calculated according to eq s2 the results showed that the aoa system energy consumption was 60 of the aao system energy consumption therefore compared with the aao process the aoa system exhibited the advantages of fully utilizing influent carbon sources and saving energy 4 conclusion stable and efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal was achieved in a pilot scale aoa system with a daily treatment capacity of 100 m3 the dpr ability ensured low tp concentration of 0 24 0 13 mg l in the effluent after the long term post anoxic stage low phosphorus release in the anaerobic zone guaranteed sufficient carbon sources storage of endogenous denitrification at a low c n ratio 5 07 this was the key to enhanced nitrogen removal with tn removal efficiency of 85 72 and effluent tn concentration of 3 60 1 55 mg l the dominance of tetrasphaera and candidatus competitor in the aoa system was a potential factor for enhancing the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal furthermore the microbial community of aoa system was similar to that of the aao system which was conducive to the rapid start up of the aoa system high removal efficiency under carbon limitation and low energy consumption were beneficial to its practical application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15588,nitrogen doped biochar n bc has been widely concerned in the field of environmental protection this study verified the alfalfa based n bc pyrolyzed at different temperatures is able to catalyze carbon tetrachloride ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions under normal environmental ph range 6 3 8 3 effectively with cl trichloromethane cf cs2 and hco3 as predominated products higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in larger specific surface area more pores and better catalytic capacity the n bc had a good tolerance to water matrix in catalyzing ct dechlorination by sulfide while the higher ph value or higher dosage of sulfide or n bc was beneficial to catalytic ct dechlorination the generation of cs2 was the major ct dechlorination pathway attributing to the sn2 nucleophilic substitution by newborn c ss structure generating from the interaction between pyridine n and sulfide besides generation of cf via hydrogenolysis process was the minor ct dechlorination pathway owing to the enhanced electron transfer by pyrrole n graphitic n and quinones on surface of n bc it was the first time that n bc was found to be effective in catalyzing the hydrogenolysis process of ct dechlorination this study emphasized the importance of n bc in restoring chlorinated hydrocarbons polluted aquatic environment containing sulfide such as sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon tetrachloride n doped biochar sulfide catalyzed hydrogenolysis catalyzed nucleophilic substitution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbon tetrachloride ct one of the persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons chs with stable chemical properties and biological toxicity is widely released from industrial processes including dry cleaning metal degreasing and spices leaching cundy et al 2021 huang et al 2021 ct is commonly detected in groundwater sediments and soil and extremely harmful to the surrounding ecological environment animals and even humans liu et al 2019 therefore many technologies have been developed to eliminate ct from contaminated environments for decades lin et al 2019 yin et al 2018 ct is very difficult to oxidize because of its full chlorine substituted c1 compound therefore the reductive dechlorination process is a common strategy for ct detoxification zhang et al 2021 however the half life period of ct reduced by natural reductants like sulfide containing components e g hs s2 and sx 2 and iron minerals is about 2600 d in natural aquatic solutions kriegman king and reinhard 1994 several engineered reductive materials particularly metal materials have been explored to reduce ct in aquatic environment including nano micro sized zero metals e g fe0 li et al 2021b zhu et al 2021a modified fe functional materials chen et al 2020 nunez garcia et al 2020 fes doong and wu 1992 and bi metal zhu et al 2021b similar to fe based materials the sulfide containing component is also one of the most abundant reductants in some natural aquatic environments particularly in sediments and inshore groundwater findlay et al 2020 ma et al 2022 it was found that in subsurface environments sulfide can be produced by sulfate reducing bacteria with pore water concentrations varying from 1 μmol l to 2 3 mmol l he et al 2019 zeng et al 2012 besides the sulfide containing component has better water solubility mobility and reducing capacity under alkaline conditions than fe based materials ding et al 2018 ma et al 2022 therefore sulfide containing component has a great potential in ct remediation while the sulfide alone was found cannot effectively reduce ct in practical kriegman king and reinhard 1994 recent studies have found that sulfide can effectively reduce certain nitroaromatic hydrocarbons liu et al 2017 and chs yang et al 2020 mediated by carbon materials particularly the nitrogen doped carbon materials n cms ding et al 2018 liu et al 2021 raising the possibility of using sulfide as reductant for ct detoxification for example our previous research demonstrated that n cms was capable to catalyze sulfide to reduce some c2 chs by mediating the process of bimolecular chlorine elimination containing the nucleophilic substitution pathway ding et al 2018 yang et al 2020 besides the rates of dehydrochlorination and hydrolytic dechlorination processes were also enhanced 2 3 orders of magnitude facilitated by nitrogen doped porous carbons liu et al 2021 in addition to the aforementioned dechlorination pathways the hydrogenolysis process is another important dechlorination pathway of chs which normally occurs during in the ct reductive dechlorination su et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 shen et al 2022 however up to now it was unclear whether ct could be reduced in sulfide containing aqueous solutions using n cms therefore it is of great importance to explore whether the hydrogenolysis process can be mediated by n cms by investigating the performance of n cms mediated ct dechlorination nitrogen doped biochar n bc one kind of biochar with certain degree of nitrogen functional groups on its surface is one kind of the cheapest n cms leng et al 2020 n bc has obvious economic feasibility in large scale engineering of chs remediation compared with the aforementioned metal reductants akhil et al 2021 moreover n bc normally with an acceptable specific surface area ssa will act as an adsorbent to control the migration of chs kasera et al 2022 leng et al 2021 if the reductive dechlorination process could be catalyzed by n bc significant environmental sustainability could be achieved considering the ecological regulation services of biochars e g improving soil fertility wang et al 2020 in the present study a series of n bc were synthesized successfully using alfalfa one of the most widely distributed cultivated leguminous pasture in the world liang et al 2019 as raw biomass and then employed to catalyze ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions it was the first time that n bc was found to be effective in catalyzing reductive ct dechlorination by sulfide which provided an alternative strategy for ct dechlorination in aquatic environments the main object of this study includes 1 to characterize the physicochemical properties and apparent structures of alfalfa based n bc materials

purchased from macklin reagent co ltd deionized water was used in all experiments n bc was manufactured using alfalfa as raw material in detail alfalfa was pyrolyzed at 600 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min in a tube furnace under the protection of constant flow of n2 gas 99 9 to get biochar with ring structures and plentiful defective structures leng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 then the black products were smashed into powders and modified with 4 m hno3 for 8 h the modified powders were then rinsed with ultrapure water oven dried in vacuum at 60 c overnight and finally re pyrolyzed at 600 c 700 c and 800 c respectively generating nitrogen doped biochar with different contents of different types of nitrogen functional groups wan et al 2020 the as prepared products were coded as n bc x x represents the heating temperature x 600 700 and 800 respectively besides a control material coded as bc 800 was also prepared via the same procedure as n bc 800 excluding the modification with hno3 2

desorption branches of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the surface morphology was observed using scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectrometer sem eds jeol jsm 5600 japan the

beamline at the canadian light source and a si 111 double crystal monochramator was employed to cover the energy range of 2 10 kev 2 3 batch experiments in batch experiments 4 mg material and 0 8 ml sulfide 0 1 mol l were added into 39 2 ml oxygen free nah2po4 na2hpo4 buffer solution 0 1 mol l in a 40 ml amber vial resulting no headspace in our batch experiments the vial was then transferred into an anaerobic glove box coy laboratory usa and a 20 μl stock solution of ct 0 8 mol l dissolved in methanol was injected into the vial leading to the initial concentration of ct was 0 4 mmol l the vial was sealed immediately with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined screw cap and then transferred into a shaker at 150 rpm 25 1 c to make sure the material was well dispersed the ph was observed to be 7 6 after adding sulfide and ct during the reaction a subset of vials was taken out from the shaker at scheduled time which was used for the detection of ct and its possible dechlorination products besides the kinetics and isotherms of ct adsorption onto n bc x were also tested with detailed method given in text s1 then the effects of various operational parameters e g the dosage of sulfide or n bc x and water matrix e g ph coexisting anions and dissolved organic matter on ct dechlorination were further investigated details given in text s2 the system contained ct and sulfide but no materials was set as the control which was sampled as same as the batch experiments to estimate stability of n bc 800 the used material was collected via filtration washed with distillated water and vacuum dried for the next run all aforementioned experiments were conducted in triplicates and the average values with standard deviations were provided 2 4 chemical analysis ct and its dechlorination products including chcl3 and cs2 were verified and quantitatively detected by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890b 5977b agilent usa equipped with a purge and trap system atomx tekmar usa and a hp 1 column 50 m 320 μm 1 05 μm to verify the possible dechlorination product chloroform radical ccl3 a trapping experiment was conducted using 2 3 dimethyl 2 butene dmb as radical trappers

chromatography ic ics 2100 dionex usa equipped with a ds5 conductivity detector sulfide concentrations were analyzed using the method of methylene blue spectrophotometry by hach reagents on a dr3900 spectrophotometer hach usa density functional theory dft calculations were also employed to help understanding the dechlorination of ct 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of materials the xps results demonstrated that c o and n atoms were the predominant elements on surface of all prepared biochar n bc x and bc 800 fig 1 a and table s1 specifically n bc x had higher n and o content compared with bc 800 which was introduced by the modification of hno3 the n content of n bc 600 n bc 700 and n bc 800 were 4 2 at 3 3 at and 2 8 at respectively table s1 which were higher than some common commercial n cms e g n cmk 3 1 5 at table s1 liu et al 2021 the content of n or o on surface of materials decreased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature fig 1a due to the combination of carbon matrix and n or o during the graphitization process chen et al 2018 meanwhile the unstable five ring nitrogen structure e g pyrrole n n5 converted into more stable six ring nitrogen structure e g pyridine n n6 wan et al 2020 as a result the percentage of n5 decreased while the percentage of n6 and the graphitic n gn increased fig 1b and fig s1 the ftir patterns of n bc x displayed typical signals of coc group c o group and oh group at 1040 cm 1 1700 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 respectively fig 1c ma et al 2020 besides the signals of c n at 1125 cm 1 and c n at 1569 cm 1 were also recognized which was in agreement with the nitrogen doping results observed in xps fig 1c kundoo et al 2004 rekha krishnan et al 2021 the xrd patterns of n bc x showed two broad diffraction peaks centered at about 25 and 44 which were assigned to the diffraction signals of the crystal planes 002 and 100 of graphite structures fig 1d li et al 2021a broad signal bands suggested the carbon structure in n bc x was predominantly amorphous with moderate degree of graphitization li et al 2021a a slight enhancement of xrd peaks with the increase of pyrolysis temperature was observed indicating the degree of graphitization was reinforced yang et al 2020 the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms displayed type iv adsorption curves with h1 hysteresis loop suggesting the as prepared materials had a large ssa and plentiful mesopores fig 2 a hijazi et al 2019 the calculated ssa values of n bc 600 n bc 700 and n bc 800 were 330 499 and 755 m2 g respectively table s1 the higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in larger ssa values because more volatile substances in biochar were released at higher pyrolysis temperature das et al 2021 for the same reason some smaller mesoporous would be generated during the release of volatile substances under higher temperature leading to the smaller average pore size and larger pore volume fig 2b and table s1 zhang et al 2020 the ssa of n bc x was higher than that of bc 800 293 m2 g which were ascribed to the removal of ash mineral components and some other unstable substances from biochar through acid pickling process table s1 chen et al 2019 analogous to above results the sem fig 2c and fig s2 and tem fig 2g images also displayed the hierarchical pores existed in n bc 800 fig 2c and fig 2g which was beneficial to the effective contact between sulfide or ct and the active sites on surface of n bc 800 the eds mappings further showed a relatively uniform distribution of n and o element into carbon framework fig 2d 2f the above results proved that the impregnation pretreatment of biochar by hno3 followed by pyrolysis is an effective strategy for preparing n bc 3 2 performance of catalytic ct dechlorination the adsorption removal efficiency of ct of n bc 600 n bc 700 n bc 800 and bc 800 was 5 25 6 05 10 50 and 13 75 respectively the adsorption kinetics and isotherms indicated that the n bc x removed some percent of ct by adsorption while the efficiency was very limited fig s3 and table s3 and s4 the sulfide itself was not able to remove ct effectively neither fig s4 in contrast ct was totally removed by sulfide in the presence of n bc 800 in 60 h fig 3 a similar phenomenon was also observed in the system containing n bc 600 or n bc 700 figs s5 therefore n bc x was confirmed to be effective in catalyzing ct reductive dechlorination by sulfide cf cs2 and cl were detected as the predominated products of ct dechlorination by sulfide based on the analysis results of gc ms and ic cf is the hydrogenolysis product of ct through two electron transfer process chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge it was the first time that n cm was found to be effective in catalyzing the hydrogenolysis process of ct which was an important supplement in the n cms catalyzed chs dechlorination processes except for cf the cs2 was another main product of ct dechlorination which was reported to form via the nucleophilic substitution pathway kriegman king and reinhard 1992 interestingly the concentration of cs2 first increased and then decreased fig 3a the decrease of cs2 could be attributed to its hydrolysis into hco3 eqs 1 3 kriegman king and reinhard 1992 the mass balance of chorine and carbon were calculated by eq 4 and eq 5 respectively the loss of mass balance indicated that some undetectable chlorine containing compounds except for cf generated during the transformation of ct and cs2 fig 3a revealing that the complex reactions involved in n bc 800 catalyzed ct dechlorination which would be discussed later fig 3b presented the kinetics of the ct dechlorination plotted as ln c t c 0 versus time the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs of n bc 600 n bc 700 and n bc 800 were 0 0356 h 1 0 0499 h 1 and 0 0866 h 1 respectively clearly the n bc 800 possessed the best catalytic capacity in ct dechlorination by sulfide which was superior to that of any quinones table s5 the calculated cf yield of n bc 800 according to eq 6 was 20 08 which was smaller than that of n bc 600 33 05 and n bc 700 27 78 fig 3c in contrast the maximum detection amount of cs2 during ct dechlorination catalyzed by n bc 800 0 19 mmol l was higher than that of n bc 600 0 10 mmol l and n bc 700 0 16 mmol l fig 3c the decarburization rate and dechlorination rate of catalyzed ct reduction were also calculated by eq 7 and eq 8 respectively the results displayed that n bc 800 possessed the highest decarburization rate 71 89 and dechlorination rate 75 01 fig 3d as well reflecting the sufficient detoxification of ct moreover the n bc 800 remained excellent and stable catalytic ability of ct dechlorination after five cycles of use confirming its acceptable reusability fig s6a similar recycling performances were also obtained for n bc 600 and n bc 700 fig s6b besides fig s7 displayed that nearly no change of xrd and raman spectrum after ct dechlorination reflecting the n bc 800 was relatively stable in summary n bc 800 exhibited the optimal catalytic performance which was therefore employed to explore the mechanism of n bc catalyzed ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions 1 c s 2 o h c s 2 o h 2 c s 2 o h o h cs o 2 h h s 3 cs o 2 h o h hc o 3 h s 4 1 4 mass balance of c chlorine t 4 c ct t 3 c cf t c c l t 4 5 mass balance of c

c c l t c c t 0 100 3 3 effects of ph on ct dechlorination the effect of ph on catalyzed ct dechlorination was shown in fig 4 the observed k obs value under normal environmental ph 6 3 7 6 and 8 3 was in the range of 0 0511 h 1 to 0 1108 h 1 along with the half life values of 6 26 h to 13 56 h fig 4a in contrast the reported half life period of ct reduced by natural reductants was about 2600 d in natural aquatic solutions kriegman king and reinhard 1994 therefore it was clear that the n bc x was able to accelarate the ct reductive dechlorination under common environmental conditions the observed k obs increased obviously with the increase of ph revealing that n bc catalyzed ct dechlorination by sulfide was an alkaline facilitated reaction fig 4a similar ph dependency of chs removal in sulfide containing anaerobic solutions mediated by quinone compounds was reported as well doong and chiang 2005 besides the rate of decarburization dechlorination and the obtained maximum value of cs2 were also enhanced with the increase of ph value while the yield of cf decreased figs 4b and 4c notably the generation of cf involving a hydrogenolysis pathway primarily relied on reductibility whereas the formation of cs2 via nucleophilic substitution pathway primarily relied on nucleophilicity doong and chiang 2005 the s species presents mainly as s2 in high alkaline solution and tends to be nucleophilic s2 2 and sx 2 which possess significantly higher nucleophilicity than other s species commonly existed at low ph h2s hs jørgensen et al 2019 therefore the alkaline conditions favored the generation of cs2 3 4 effects of dosages of sulfide and n bc 800 on ct dechlorination the effects of the dosage of sulfide and n bc 800 were shown in figs 5 a and 5b respectively the k obs of ct removal increased linearly with the increased dosage of sulfide and n bc 800 indicating that the dosage of both sulfide and n bc 800 affected the ct dechlorination specifically the slope of linear relationship between dosage of sulfide mmol l and k obs k 0 0394 r2 0 965 was higher than that of n bc 800 mg l k 0 0008 r2 0 976 suggesting the greater influence of the dosage of sulfide on ct dechlorination than n bc 800 however no obvious increase in k obs was observed with a further increase in sulfide dosage to 10 mmol l fig s8 indicating that the dosage of sulfide was excessive and the concentration of n bc 800 became the limiting factor of the ct dechlorination the dosage of sulfide and n bc 800 also impacted the yield of cf and the maximum detection amount of cs2 detected during ct dechlorination in general higher dosage of sulfide or n bc 800 brought out smaller yield of cf and higher value of maximum detection amount of cs2 figs s9 and s10 therefore it was speculated that more amount of s nucleophilic group generated during the full contact between sulfide and n bc 800 which then resulted in the faster ct dechlorination 3 5 effects of anions and dissolved organic matter on ct dechlorination the effects of co existing anions e g cl so4 2 no3 and dissolved organic maters e g humic acid ha on catalytic ct dechlorination were further investigated as shown in fig 6 a the three kinds of common anions do not have a significant effect on catalytic ct dechlorination whereas the ha presented significant inhibitory influence on catalytic ct dechlorination p 0 01 in detail the observed k obs values decreased from 0 0866 h 1 to 0 0733 h 1 0 0662 h 1 and 0 0460 h 1 in the presence of 1 mm 2 mm and 5 mm of ha respectively the presence of ha significantly inhibited ct adsorption onto n bc 800 p 0 01 leading to the apparent decrease of qe fig 6b interestingly a linear positive correlation r2 0 986 existed between k obs and q e under different initial ha concentrations fig 6c therefore it was speculated that the decrease of catalytic ct efficiency was attributed to the competitive adsorption of ha on surface of n bc 800 fig s11 by several possible noncovalent interactions including van der waals force π π staking and coupling and electrostatic interactions aftab et al 2019 nguyen et al 2022 these interactions could block the reactive sites of n bc 800 leading to weak catalytic capacity for ct dechlorination however note that n bc 800 remained sufficiently efficient to catalyze the ct dechlorination by sulfide even under the ha inhibition considering that the k obs value of n bc 800 0 0460 h 1 under 5 mm of ha was higher than that of n bc 600 0 0356 h 1 the above results demonstrated that n bc 800 exhibited good tolerance to the water matrix e g ph co existing anions and ha in catalyzing ct dechlorination by sulfide 3 6 mechanisms of n bc 800 mediated ct reductive dechlorination by sulfide n bc x possessed much better catalytic performance than bc 800 in ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions fig 3 and fig s12 the commercial n doped mesoporous carbon n cmk 3 also exhibited better catalytic performance on ct dechlorination than its corresponding mesoporous carbon without n adulteration cmk 3 fig s12 the above results reflected the importance of nitrogen doping besides it was also found that the n bc x with larger ssa had higher ct adsorption capacity and better catalytic performance of ct dechlorination fig s13 which emphasized the importance of surface contact process controlled by ssa for the heterogeneous catalysis of ct dechlorination therefore the concept of ssa of nitrogen content of nitrogen ssa m2 g was introduced to help understanding the mechanism of catalytic ct dechlorination it was found a roughly positive correlation between the ssa of total n the content of n ssa m2 g and the observed k obs fig 7 a to identify potential key active sites the relationship between the amount of specific nitrogenous functional groups and k obs was also studied the result showed a good linear positive correlation between the ssa of n6 content of n6 ssa m2 g and k obs r2 0 963 fig 7b whereas no similar relationship between other nitrogenous functional groups and k obs fig s14 in summary we hypothesized that the adulteration of n in carbon materials played a critical role in mediating ct dechlorination and that nitrogenous functional groups particularly n6 may act as the key active sites the yield of cf decreased gradually in system containing n cms with the enhancement of n adulteration and was normally smaller than that in a system containing non n cms fig 3b however an opposite phenomenon for the maximum detection amount of cs2 was observed fig 3c therefore a competition may exist in the generation of cf and cs2 as reflected by the xps and ftir results both bc and n bc x were rich in quinone hydroquinone structures fig 1c which can mediate electron transfer in redox reactions pignatello et al 2017 for example the quinone moiety in humic substances was proven to catalyze ct dechlorination by sulfides via the electron shuttle mechanism doong and chiang 2005 a similar mechanism was also known to be responsible for the catalyzed reduction of nitroaromatic hydrocarbons wei et al 2020 in this study the abundant quinone hydroquinone groups in n bc 800 were also responsible for the catalytic ct reduction by sulfide with cf as the reduction product in addition some nitrogenous functional groups e g n5 π6 5 and gn π7 6 were known as electron rich structures with higher density of electron cloud compared to pure carbon framework guo et al 2016 which can improve electron transfer liu et al 2021 therefore we have reasons to believe that nitrogen adulteration into biochar is able to enhance the generation of cf via ct hydrogenolysis the nitrogenous functional groups on surface of n bc x may also play critical role in the generation of cs2 via a nucleophilic substitution pathway because the higher n6 content led to a larger maximum detection amount of cs2 fig s15 some superior nucleophiles were inferred to be generated during the full contact between sulfides and n bc 800 since the nucleophilicity of hs or s2 was insufficient to replace one cl from ct molecule fig 3a and an obvious increase in s content on the surface of the used n bc 800 was observed compared with the fresh n bc 800 based on the results of eds mapping fig s16 furthermore the changes in the elemental chemical state of the surface of n bc 800 during ct removal were examined by xps and xas based on the xps analysis it was found the content of s on surface of n bc 800 increased from 0 0 at to 0 5 at and 0 5 at after full contact with sulfide and ct dechlorination respectively fig 8 a and table s2 the increase of s content was ascribed to the generation of some new s containing intermediates including c s 162 9 ev c ss sn 163 8 ev and s ox 168 3 ev lee et al 2011 moreover based on the xas result an obvious peak at 2471 6 ev in s k edge spectra was found after 1 h interaction of sulfide which continued increasing during the interaction period with sulfide and ct dechlorination fig 8b the peak at 2471 6 ev was attributed to c ss because it was well matched to the energy position of dibenzyl disulfide a model substance containing the structure of c ss r h yu et al 2015 this result was consistent with the result obtained by s 2p xps the nucleophilicity of c ss structure was proven to be higher than hs s2 and glutathione ida et al 2014 which was in agreement with the above inference that some new s containing superior nucleophile generated during the contact between sulfides and n bc 800 along with the generation of c ss the content of n6 decreased from 40 2 to 33 1 and 31 2 after full contact with sulfide and ct dechlorination respectively fig 8c the n k edge spectra result of n bc 800 also confirmed the decreased content of n6 peaks at 397 9 ev fig 8d ray et al 2014 these observations suggested that some interactions may have occurred between sulfide and n6 consequently leading to the generation of c ss structure described in fig s17 in theory as an electron withdrawing group the n atom in n6 is able to reduce the electron density on adjacent c atom guo et al 2016 resulting a high positive charged c atom thus it is rational that electrostatic attraction existed between positive charged c atom and negative charged sulfide besides it was reported that the peak energy of n6 398 5 ev would increase a little bit and get close to that of n5 400 1 ev when the c atom adjacent to n atom is connected to some electron withdrawing groups such as c or c oor guo et al 2016 and cssr ding et al 2018 which was consistent with decrease of n6 content and increase of n5 content described in fig 8c these results further demonstrated the existence of c ss structure and the vital role of n6 in the conversion process from ct to cs2 in addition the n6 was able to elongate c cl bond in ct based on the density functional theory dft calculation results by using a nitrogen doped nanoribbon model fig s18 leading to a decrease of bond energy of c cl which was beneficial to both hydrogenolysis process and nucleophilic substitution process 3 7 possible pathways of n bc 800 catalyzed ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions based on the above discussions and the existing literatures possible pathways for n bc 800 catalyzed ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions were proposed in fig 9 the generation of cf is as follows the ct gained an electron from sulfide mediated by n bc 800 at first and transferred into chloroform radical fig s19 and cl as described in path ① the chloroform radical with strong reactivity was then going to gain one electron also provided by sulfide to form trichloromethyl anion path ② doong and wu 1992 then the trichloromethyl anion could then combine with one proton to form cf path ③ however the cf could not obtain electrons from sulfide anymore to realize the further hydrogenolysis to dichloromethane since nearly no dichloromethane was detected in the system within cf sulfide and n bc 800 the the generation of cs2 is as follows the c ss structures generated at first on surface of n bc c ss as discussed above which was able to attack 8 nitroguanosine 3 5 cyclic monophosphate ida et al 2014 and trichloroethylene ding et al 2018 by sn2 nucleophilic substitution the c cl bond energy in ct was relatively lower than that of trichloroethylene ding et al 2018 therefore it was reasonable to speculated that the c ss could attack ct molecular with the generation of c ss ccl3 and cl by sn2 nucleophilic substitution path ④ a similar pathway was reported in the pyrite mediated ct reductive dechlorination by sulfide where the unknown nucleophilic s substance on surface of pyrite was assumed to be fe ss kriegman king and reinhard 1994 the c ss ccl3 may react with hs or s2 to form c ssh or c ss and sccl3 as described in path ⑤ then sccl3 further decomposed into thiophosgene path ⑥ which was highly unstable and was very likely to react with c ss to form cs2 path ⑦ kriegman king and reinhard 1994 furthermore the cs2 could be transferred into hco3 via eqs 1 3 in the presence of n bc 800 path ⑧ based on the decrease of cs2 shown in fig 3a clearly an obvious competition relationship existed between the generation of cf and cs2 fig 9 the higher n adulteration especially the n6 in n bc brought out more c ss which was then beneficial to the path ④ leading to the higher detected maximum amount of cs2 and lower cf during ct dechlorination fig 3c in addition the chloroform radical and trichloromethyl anion was also able to react with sulfides or polysulfides to form sccl3 as shown in paths ⑨ and ⑩ doong and wu 1992 the c ss ccl3 was also able to accept electrons provided by sulfide leading to generation of chloroform radical and trichloromethyl anion path ⑪ the proportions of hs and s2 increased along with the increase of ph value jørgensen et al 2019 therefore the higher ph was in favor of the paths ⑨ and ⑩ while went against the path ③ as a result the yield of cf was lower under higher ph as shown in fig 4b in summary complex processes were involved in n bc catalyzed ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions including catalytic sn2 nucleophilic substitution as major process and catalytic hydrogenolysis as minor process 4 conclusions in this study several n bcs were prepared by re pyrolyzing nitric acid impregnated biochar at different temperatures using alfalfa as raw biomass these n bcs were then demonstrated to be effective in catalyzing ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions higher pyrolysis temperature of n bc resulted in larger ssa more pores and as a consequence better catalytic capacity the predominated products of catalytic ct dechlorination were cl cf cs2 and hco3 specifically the concentration of cs2 first increased and then decreased during ct dechlorination the catalytic ct dechlorination was feasible under normal environmental ph range of 6 3 8 3 while higher ph resulted in enhanced catalytic ct removal rate higher dosage of sulfide or n bc 800 was beneficial to catalytic ct dechlorination leading to smaller yield of cf and higher value of maximum detection amount of cs2 besides the n bc 800 had a good tolerance to water matrix in catalyzing ct dechlorination by sulfide the catalytic hydrogenolysis from ct to cf was ascribed to the enhanced electron transfer by n5 gn and quinone hydroquinone in contrast the generation of cs2 was attributed to the nucleophilic substitution by newborn c ss structure generating from the interaction between n6 and sulfide the catalytic sn2 nucleophilic substitution was the major ct dechlorination pathway whereas catalytic hydrogenolysis was the minor dechlorination pathway overall the mediated effects of nitrogen functional groups especially n6 were of great importance to catalytic ct declorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions this study further confirmed the great potential of n bcs in restoring chs polluted aquatic environments considering that the n bcs were low cost environment friendly and always possess acceptable adsorption of organics further studies would be conducted to establish an n bc 800 capping of sediments and to investigate its long term effects on the control and dechlorination of chs declaration of competing interest the

15588,nitrogen doped biochar n bc has been widely concerned in the field of environmental protection this study verified the alfalfa based n bc pyrolyzed at different temperatures is able to catalyze carbon tetrachloride ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions under normal environmental ph range 6 3 8 3 effectively with cl trichloromethane cf cs2 and hco3 as predominated products higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in larger specific surface area more pores and better catalytic capacity the n bc had a good tolerance to water matrix in catalyzing ct dechlorination by sulfide while the higher ph value or higher dosage of sulfide or n bc was beneficial to catalytic ct dechlorination the generation of cs2 was the major ct dechlorination pathway attributing to the sn2 nucleophilic substitution by newborn c ss structure generating from the interaction between pyridine n and sulfide besides generation of cf via hydrogenolysis process was the minor ct dechlorination pathway owing to the enhanced electron transfer by pyrrole n graphitic n and quinones on surface of n bc it was the first time that n bc was found to be effective in catalyzing the hydrogenolysis process of ct dechlorination this study emphasized the importance of n bc in restoring chlorinated hydrocarbons polluted aquatic environment containing sulfide such as sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon tetrachloride n doped biochar sulfide catalyzed hydrogenolysis catalyzed nucleophilic substitution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbon tetrachloride ct one of the persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons chs with stable chemical properties and biological toxicity is widely released from industrial processes including dry cleaning metal degreasing and spices leaching cundy et al 2021 huang et al 2021 ct is commonly detected in groundwater sediments and soil and extremely harmful to the surrounding ecological environment animals and even humans liu et al 2019 therefore many technologies have been developed to eliminate ct from contaminated environments for decades lin et al 2019 yin et al 2018 ct is very difficult to oxidize because of its full chlorine substituted c1 compound therefore the reductive dechlorination process is a common strategy for ct detoxification zhang et al 2021 however the half life period of ct reduced by natural reductants like sulfide containing components e g hs s2 and sx 2 and iron minerals is about 2600 d in natural aquatic solutions kriegman king and reinhard 1994 several engineered reductive materials particularly metal materials have been explored to reduce ct in aquatic environment including nano micro sized zero metals e g fe0 li et al 2021b zhu et al 2021a modified fe functional materials chen et al 2020 nunez garcia et al 2020 fes doong and wu 1992 and bi metal zhu et al 2021b similar to fe based materials the sulfide containing component is also one of the most abundant reductants in some natural aquatic environments particularly in sediments and inshore groundwater findlay et al 2020 ma et al 2022 it was found that in subsurface environments sulfide can be produced by sulfate reducing bacteria with pore water concentrations varying from 1 μmol l to 2 3 mmol l he et al 2019 zeng et al 2012 besides the sulfide containing component has better water solubility mobility and reducing capacity under alkaline conditions than fe based materials ding et al 2018 ma et al 2022 therefore sulfide containing component has a great potential in ct remediation while the sulfide alone was found cannot effectively reduce ct in practical kriegman king and reinhard 1994 recent studies have found that sulfide can effectively reduce certain nitroaromatic hydrocarbons liu et al 2017 and chs yang et al 2020 mediated by carbon materials particularly the nitrogen doped carbon materials n cms ding et al 2018 liu et al 2021 raising the possibility of using sulfide as reductant for ct detoxification for example our previous research demonstrated that n cms was capable to catalyze sulfide to reduce some c2 chs by mediating the process of bimolecular chlorine elimination containing the nucleophilic substitution pathway ding et al 2018 yang et al 2020 besides the rates of dehydrochlorination and hydrolytic dechlorination processes were also enhanced 2 3 orders of magnitude facilitated by nitrogen doped porous carbons liu et al 2021 in addition to the aforementioned dechlorination pathways the hydrogenolysis process is another important dechlorination pathway of chs which normally occurs during in the ct reductive dechlorination su et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 shen et al 2022 however up to now it was unclear whether ct could be reduced in sulfide containing aqueous solutions using n cms therefore it is of great importance to explore whether the hydrogenolysis process can be mediated by n cms by investigating the performance of n cms mediated ct dechlorination nitrogen doped biochar n bc one kind of biochar with certain degree of nitrogen functional groups on its surface is one kind of the cheapest n cms leng et al 2020 n bc has obvious economic feasibility in large scale engineering of chs remediation compared with the aforementioned metal reductants akhil et al 2021 moreover n bc normally with an acceptable specific surface area ssa will act as an adsorbent to control the migration of chs kasera et al 2022 leng et al 2021 if the reductive dechlorination process could be catalyzed by n bc significant environmental sustainability could be achieved considering the ecological regulation services of biochars e g improving soil fertility wang et al 2020 in the present study a series of n bc were synthesized successfully using alfalfa one of the most widely distributed cultivated leguminous pasture in the world liang et al 2019 as raw biomass and then employed to catalyze ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions it was the first time that n bc was found to be effective in catalyzing reductive ct dechlorination by sulfide which provided an alternative strategy for ct dechlorination in aquatic environments the main object of this study includes 1 to characterize the physicochemical properties and apparent structures of alfalfa based n bc materials prepared under different temperature 2 to investigate the catalytic performance of n bc on ct dechlorination by sulfide and explore its influence factors 3 to speculate the main catalytic mechanism of

purchased from macklin reagent co ltd deionized water was used in all experiments n bc was manufactured using alfalfa as raw material in detail alfalfa was pyrolyzed at 600 c for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min in a tube furnace under the protection of constant flow of n2 gas 99 9 to get biochar with ring structures and plentiful defective structures leng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 then the black products were smashed into powders and modified with 4 m hno3 for 8 h the modified powders were then rinsed with ultrapure water oven dried in vacuum at 60 c overnight and finally re pyrolyzed at 600 c 700 c and 800 c respectively generating nitrogen doped biochar with different contents of different types of nitrogen functional groups wan et al 2020 the as prepared products were coded as n bc x x represents the heating temperature x 600 700 and 800 respectively besides a control material coded as bc 800 was also prepared via the same procedure as n bc 800 excluding the modification with hno3 2 2 characterization the ssa of n bc x was obtained by the brunauere emmette teller procedure and their pore distributions were calculated using the barret joyner halenda model according to the desorption branches of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the surface morphology was observed using scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectrometer sem eds jeol jsm 5600 japan the

beamline at the canadian light source and a si 111 double crystal monochramator was employed to cover the energy range of 2 10 kev 2 3 batch experiments in batch experiments 4 mg material and 0 8 ml sulfide 0 1 mol l were added into 39 2 ml oxygen free nah2po4 na2hpo4 buffer solution 0 1 mol l in a 40 ml amber vial resulting no headspace in our batch experiments the vial was then transferred into an anaerobic glove box coy laboratory usa and a 20 μl stock solution of ct 0 8 mol l dissolved in methanol was injected into the vial leading to the initial concentration of ct was 0 4 mmol l the vial was sealed immediately with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined screw cap and then transferred into a shaker at 150 rpm 25 1 c to make sure the material was well dispersed the ph was observed to be 7 6 after adding sulfide and ct during the reaction a subset of vials was taken out from the shaker at scheduled time which was used for the detection of ct and its possible dechlorination products besides the kinetics and isotherms of ct adsorption onto n bc x were also tested with detailed method given in text s1 then the effects of various operational parameters e g the dosage of sulfide or n bc x and water matrix e g ph coexisting anions and dissolved organic matter on ct dechlorination were further investigated details given in text s2 the system contained ct and sulfide but no materials was set as the control which was sampled as same as the batch experiments to estimate stability of n bc 800 the used material was collected via filtration washed with distillated water and vacuum dried for the next run all aforementioned experiments were conducted in triplicates and the average values with standard deviations were provided 2 4 chemical analysis ct and its dechlorination products including chcl3 and cs2 were verified and quantitatively detected by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890b 5977b agilent usa equipped with a purge and trap system atomx tekmar usa and a hp 1 column 50 m 320 μm 1 05 μm to verify the possible dechlorination product chloroform radical ccl3 a trapping experiment was conducted using 2 3 dimethyl 2 butene dmb as radical trappers since the dmb can rapidly attack the unstable ccl3 to generate stable 4 4 4 trichloro 2 3 3 trimethyl 1 butene which can be identified by gc ms jia et al 2022 cl was determined by an ion chromatography ic ics 2100 dionex usa equipped with a ds5 conductivity detector sulfide concentrations were analyzed using the method of methylene blue spectrophotometry by hach reagents on a dr3900 spectrophotometer hach usa density functional theory dft calculations were also employed to help understanding the dechlorination of ct 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of materials the xps results demonstrated that c o and n atoms were the predominant elements on surface of all prepared biochar n bc x and bc 800 fig 1 a and table s1 specifically n bc x had higher n and o content compared with bc 800 which was introduced by the modification of hno3 the n content of n bc 600 n bc 700 and n bc 800 were 4 2 at 3 3 at and 2 8 at respectively table s1 which were higher than some common commercial n cms e g n cmk 3 1 5 at table s1 liu et al 2021 the content of n or o on surface of materials decreased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature fig 1a due to the combination of carbon matrix and n or o during the graphitization process chen et al 2018 meanwhile the unstable five ring nitrogen structure e g pyrrole n n5 converted into more stable six ring nitrogen structure e g pyridine n n6 wan et al 2020 as a result the percentage of n5 decreased while the percentage of n6 and the graphitic n gn increased fig 1b and fig s1 the ftir patterns of n bc x displayed typical signals of coc group c o group and oh group at 1040 cm 1 1700 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 respectively fig 1c ma et al 2020 besides the signals of c n at 1125 cm 1 and c n at 1569 cm 1 were also recognized which was in agreement with the nitrogen doping results observed in xps fig 1c kundoo et al 2004 rekha krishnan et al 2021 the xrd patterns of n bc x showed two broad diffraction peaks centered at about 25 and 44 which were assigned to the diffraction signals of the crystal planes 002 and 100 of graphite structures fig 1d li et al 2021a broad signal bands suggested the carbon structure in n bc x was predominantly amorphous with moderate degree of graphitization li et al 2021a a slight enhancement of xrd peaks with the increase of pyrolysis temperature was observed indicating the degree of graphitization was reinforced yang et al 2020 the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms displayed type iv adsorption curves with h1 hysteresis loop suggesting the as prepared materials had a large ssa and plentiful mesopores fig 2 a hijazi et al 2019 the calculated ssa values of n bc 600 n bc 700 and n bc 800 were 330 499 and 755 m2 g respectively table s1 the higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in larger ssa values because more volatile substances in biochar were released at higher pyrolysis temperature das et al 2021 for the same reason some smaller mesoporous would be generated during the release of volatile substances under higher temperature leading to the smaller average pore size and larger pore volume fig 2b and table s1 zhang et al 2020 the ssa of n bc x was higher than that of bc 800 293 m2 g which were ascribed to the removal of ash mineral components and some other unstable substances from biochar through acid pickling process table s1 chen et al 2019 analogous to above results the sem fig 2c and fig s2 and tem fig 2g images also displayed the hierarchical pores existed in n bc 800 fig 2c and fig 2g which was beneficial to the effective contact between sulfide or ct and the active sites on surface of n bc 800 the eds mappings further showed a relatively uniform distribution of n and o element into carbon framework fig 2d 2f the above results proved that the impregnation pretreatment of biochar by hno3 followed by pyrolysis is an effective strategy for preparing n bc 3 2 performance of catalytic ct dechlorination the adsorption removal efficiency of ct of n bc 600 n bc 700 n bc 800 and bc 800 was 5 25 6 05 10 50 and 13 75 respectively the adsorption kinetics and isotherms indicated that the n bc x removed some percent of ct by adsorption while the efficiency was very limited fig s3 and table s3 and s4 the sulfide itself was not able to remove ct effectively neither fig s4 in contrast ct was totally removed by sulfide in the presence of n bc 800 in 60 h fig 3 a similar phenomenon was also observed in the system containing n bc 600 or n bc 700 figs s5 therefore n bc x was confirmed to be effective in catalyzing ct reductive dechlorination by sulfide cf cs2 and cl were detected as the predominated products of ct dechlorination by sulfide based on the analysis results of gc ms and ic cf is the hydrogenolysis product of ct through two electron transfer process chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge it was the first time that n cm was found to be effective in catalyzing the hydrogenolysis process of ct which was an important supplement in the n cms catalyzed chs dechlorination processes except for cf the cs2 was another main product of ct dechlorination which was reported to form via the nucleophilic substitution pathway kriegman king and reinhard 1992 interestingly the concentration of cs2 first increased and then decreased fig 3a the decrease of cs2 could be attributed to its hydrolysis into hco3 eqs 1 3 kriegman king and reinhard 1992 the mass balance of chorine and carbon were calculated by eq 4 and eq 5 respectively the loss of mass balance indicated that some undetectable chlorine containing compounds except for cf generated during the transformation of ct and cs2 fig 3a revealing that the complex reactions involved in n bc 800 catalyzed ct dechlorination which would be discussed later fig 3b presented the kinetics of the ct dechlorination plotted as ln c t c 0 versus time the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs of n bc 600 n bc 700 and n bc 800 were 0 0356 h 1 0 0499 h 1 and 0 0866 h 1 respectively clearly the n bc 800 possessed the best catalytic capacity in ct dechlorination by sulfide which was superior to that of any quinones table s5 the calculated cf yield of n bc 800 according to eq 6 was 20 08 which was smaller than that of n bc 600 33 05 and n bc 700 27 78 fig 3c in contrast the maximum detection amount of cs2 during ct dechlorination catalyzed by n bc 800 0 19 mmol l was higher than that of n bc 600 0 10 mmol l and n bc 700 0 16 mmol l fig 3c the decarburization rate and dechlorination rate of catalyzed ct reduction were also calculated by eq 7 and eq 8 respectively the results displayed that n bc 800 possessed the highest decarburization rate 71 89 and dechlorination rate 75 01 fig 3d as well reflecting the sufficient detoxification of ct moreover the n bc 800 remained excellent and stable catalytic ability of ct dechlorination after five cycles of use confirming its acceptable reusability fig s6a similar recycling performances were also obtained for n bc 600 and n bc 700 fig s6b besides fig s7 displayed that nearly no change of xrd and raman spectrum after ct dechlorination reflecting the n bc 800 was relatively stable in summary n bc 800 exhibited the optimal catalytic performance which was therefore employed to explore the mechanism of n bc catalyzed ct dechlorination

c c l t c c t 0 100 3 3 effects of ph on ct dechlorination the effect of ph on catalyzed ct dechlorination was shown in fig 4 the observed k obs value under normal environmental ph 6 3 7 6 and 8 3 was in the range of 0 0511 h 1 to 0 1108 h 1 along with the half life values of 6 26 h to 13 56 h fig 4a in contrast the reported half life period of ct reduced by natural reductants was about 2600 d in natural aquatic solutions kriegman king and reinhard 1994 therefore it was clear that the n bc x was able to accelarate the ct reductive dechlorination under common environmental conditions the observed k obs increased obviously with the increase of ph revealing that n bc catalyzed ct dechlorination by sulfide was an alkaline facilitated reaction fig 4a similar ph dependency of chs removal in sulfide containing anaerobic solutions mediated by quinone compounds was reported as well doong and chiang 2005 besides the rate of decarburization dechlorination and the obtained maximum value of cs2 were also enhanced with the increase of ph value while the yield of cf decreased figs 4b and 4c notably the generation of cf involving a hydrogenolysis pathway primarily relied on reductibility whereas the formation of cs2 via nucleophilic substitution pathway primarily relied on nucleophilicity doong and chiang 2005 the s species presents mainly as s2 in high alkaline solution and tends to be nucleophilic s2 2 and sx 2 which possess significantly higher nucleophilicity than other s species commonly existed at low ph h2s hs jørgensen et al 2019 therefore the alkaline conditions favored the generation of cs2 3 4 effects of dosages of sulfide and n bc 800 on ct dechlorination the effects of the dosage of sulfide and n bc 800 were shown in figs 5 a and 5b respectively the k obs of ct removal increased linearly with the increased dosage of sulfide and n bc 800 indicating that the dosage of both sulfide and n bc 800 affected the ct dechlorination specifically the slope of linear relationship between dosage of sulfide mmol l and k obs k 0 0394 r2 0 965 was higher than that of n bc 800 mg l k 0 0008 r2 0 976 suggesting the greater influence of the dosage of sulfide on ct dechlorination than n bc 800 however no obvious increase in k obs was observed with a further increase in sulfide dosage to 10 mmol l fig s8 indicating that the dosage of sulfide was excessive and the concentration of n bc 800 became the limiting factor of the ct dechlorination the dosage of sulfide and n bc 800 also impacted the yield of cf and the maximum detection amount of cs2 detected during ct dechlorination in general higher dosage of sulfide or n bc 800 brought out smaller yield of cf and higher value of maximum detection amount of cs2 figs s9 and s10 therefore it was speculated that more amount of s nucleophilic group generated during the full contact between sulfide and n bc 800 which then resulted in the faster ct dechlorination 3 5 effects of anions and dissolved organic matter on ct dechlorination the effects of co existing anions e g cl so4 2 no3 and dissolved organic maters e g humic acid ha on catalytic ct dechlorination were further investigated as shown in fig 6 a the three kinds of common anions do not have a significant effect on catalytic ct dechlorination whereas the ha presented significant inhibitory influence on catalytic ct dechlorination p 0 01 in detail the observed k obs values decreased from 0 0866 h 1 to 0 0733 h 1 0 0662 h 1 and 0 0460 h 1 in the presence of 1 mm 2 mm and 5 mm of ha respectively the presence of ha significantly inhibited ct adsorption onto n bc 800 p 0 01 leading to the apparent decrease of qe fig 6b interestingly a linear positive correlation r2 0 986 existed between k obs and q e under different initial ha concentrations fig 6c therefore it was speculated that the decrease of catalytic ct efficiency was attributed to the competitive adsorption of ha on surface of n bc 800 fig s11 by several possible noncovalent interactions including van der waals force π π staking and coupling and electrostatic interactions aftab et al 2019 nguyen et al 2022 these interactions could block the reactive sites of n bc 800 leading to weak catalytic capacity for ct dechlorination however note that n bc 800 remained sufficiently efficient to catalyze the ct dechlorination by sulfide even under the ha inhibition considering that the k obs value of n bc 800 0 0460 h 1 under 5 mm of ha was higher than that of n bc 600 0 0356 h 1 the above results demonstrated that n bc 800 exhibited good tolerance to the water matrix e g ph co existing anions and ha in catalyzing ct dechlorination by sulfide 3 6 mechanisms of n bc 800 mediated ct reductive dechlorination by sulfide n bc x possessed much better catalytic performance than bc 800 in ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions fig 3 and fig s12 the commercial n doped mesoporous carbon n cmk 3 also exhibited better catalytic performance on ct dechlorination than its corresponding mesoporous carbon without n adulteration cmk 3 fig s12 the above results reflected the importance of nitrogen doping besides it was also found that the n bc x with larger ssa had higher ct adsorption capacity and better catalytic performance of ct dechlorination fig s13 which emphasized the importance of surface contact process controlled by ssa for the heterogeneous catalysis of ct dechlorination therefore the concept of ssa of nitrogen content of nitrogen ssa m2 g was introduced to help understanding the mechanism of catalytic ct dechlorination it was found a roughly positive correlation between the ssa of total n the content of n ssa m2 g and the observed k obs fig 7 a to identify potential key active sites the relationship between the amount of specific nitrogenous functional groups and k obs was also studied the result showed a good linear positive correlation between the ssa of n6 content of n6 ssa m2 g and k obs r2 0 963 fig 7b whereas no similar relationship between other nitrogenous functional groups and k obs fig s14 in summary we hypothesized that the adulteration of n in carbon materials played a critical role in mediating ct dechlorination and that nitrogenous functional groups particularly n6 may act as the key active sites the yield of cf decreased gradually in system containing n cms with the enhancement of n adulteration and was normally smaller than that in a system containing non n cms fig 3b however an opposite phenomenon for the maximum detection amount of cs2 was observed fig 3c therefore a competition may exist in the generation of cf and cs2 as reflected by the xps and ftir results both bc and n bc x were rich in quinone hydroquinone structures fig 1c which can mediate electron transfer in redox reactions pignatello et al 2017 for example the quinone moiety in humic substances was proven to catalyze ct dechlorination by sulfides via the electron shuttle mechanism doong and chiang 2005 a similar mechanism was also known to be responsible for the catalyzed reduction of nitroaromatic hydrocarbons wei et al 2020 in this study the abundant quinone hydroquinone groups in n bc 800 were also responsible for the catalytic ct reduction by sulfide with cf as the reduction product in addition some nitrogenous functional groups e g n5 π6 5 and gn π7 6 were known as electron rich structures with higher density of electron cloud compared to pure carbon framework guo et al 2016 which can improve electron transfer liu et al 2021 therefore we have reasons to believe that nitrogen adulteration into biochar is able to enhance the generation of cf via ct hydrogenolysis the nitrogenous functional groups on surface of n bc x may also play critical role in the generation of cs2 via a nucleophilic substitution pathway because the higher n6 content led to a larger maximum detection amount of cs2 fig s15 some superior nucleophiles were inferred to be generated during the full contact between sulfides and n bc 800 since the nucleophilicity of hs or s2 was insufficient to replace one cl from ct molecule fig 3a and an obvious increase in s content on the surface of the used n bc 800 was observed compared with the fresh n bc 800 based on the results of eds mapping fig s16 furthermore the changes in the elemental chemical state of the surface of n bc 800 during ct removal were examined by xps and xas based on the xps analysis it was found the content of s on surface of n bc 800 increased from 0 0 at to 0 5 at and 0 5 at after full contact with sulfide and ct dechlorination respectively fig 8 a and table s2 the increase of s content was ascribed to the generation of some new s containing intermediates including c s 162 9 ev c ss sn 163 8 ev and s ox 168 3 ev lee et al 2011 moreover based on the xas result an obvious peak at 2471 6 ev in s k edge spectra was found after 1 h interaction of sulfide which continued increasing during the interaction period with sulfide and ct dechlorination fig 8b the peak at 2471 6 ev was attributed to c ss because it was well matched to the energy position of dibenzyl disulfide a model substance containing the structure of c ss r h yu et al 2015 this result was consistent with the result obtained by s 2p xps the nucleophilicity of c ss structure was proven to be higher than hs s2 and glutathione ida et al 2014 which was in agreement with the above inference that some new s containing superior nucleophile generated during the contact between sulfides and n bc 800 along with the generation of c ss the content of n6 decreased from 40 2 to 33 1 and 31 2 after full contact with sulfide and ct dechlorination respectively fig 8c the n k edge spectra result of n bc 800 also confirmed the decreased content of n6 peaks at 397 9 ev fig 8d ray et al 2014 these observations suggested that some interactions may have occurred between sulfide and n6 consequently leading to the generation of c ss structure described in fig s17 in theory as an electron withdrawing group the n atom in n6 is able to reduce the electron density on adjacent c atom guo et al 2016 resulting a high positive charged c atom thus it is rational that electrostatic attraction existed between positive charged c atom and negative charged sulfide besides it was reported that the peak energy of n6 398 5 ev would increase a little bit and get close to that of n5 400 1 ev when the c atom adjacent to n atom is connected to some electron withdrawing groups such as c or c oor guo et al 2016 and cssr ding et al 2018 which was consistent with decrease of n6 content and increase of n5 content described in fig 8c these results further demonstrated the existence of c ss structure and the vital role of n6 in the conversion process from ct to cs2 in addition the n6 was able to elongate c cl bond in ct based on the density functional theory dft calculation results by using a nitrogen doped nanoribbon model fig s18 leading to a decrease of bond energy of c cl which was beneficial to both hydrogenolysis process and nucleophilic substitution process 3 7 possible pathways of n bc 800 catalyzed ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions based on the above discussions and the existing literatures possible pathways for n bc 800 catalyzed ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions were proposed in fig 9 the generation of cf is as follows the ct gained an electron from sulfide mediated by n bc 800 at first and transferred into chloroform radical fig s19 and cl as described in path ① the chloroform radical with strong reactivity was then going to gain one electron also provided by sulfide to form trichloromethyl anion path ② doong and wu 1992 then the trichloromethyl anion could then combine with one proton to form cf path ③ however the cf could not obtain electrons from sulfide anymore to realize the further hydrogenolysis to dichloromethane since nearly no dichloromethane was detected in the system within cf sulfide and n bc 800 the the generation of cs2 is as follows the c ss structures generated at first on surface of n bc c ss as discussed above which was able to attack 8 nitroguanosine 3 5 cyclic monophosphate ida et al 2014 and trichloroethylene ding et al 2018 by sn2 nucleophilic substitution the c cl bond energy in ct was relatively lower than that of trichloroethylene ding et al 2018 therefore it was reasonable to speculated that the c ss could attack ct molecular with the generation of c ss ccl3 and cl by sn2 nucleophilic substitution path ④ a similar pathway was reported in the pyrite mediated ct reductive dechlorination by sulfide where the unknown nucleophilic s substance on surface of pyrite was assumed to be fe ss kriegman king and reinhard 1994 the c ss ccl3 may react with hs or s2 to form c ssh or c ss and sccl3 as described in path ⑤ then sccl3 further decomposed into thiophosgene path ⑥ which was highly unstable and was very likely to react with c ss to form cs2 path ⑦ kriegman king and reinhard 1994 furthermore the cs2 could be transferred into hco3 via eqs 1 3 in the presence of n bc 800 path ⑧ based on the decrease of cs2 shown in fig 3a clearly an obvious competition relationship existed between the generation of cf and cs2 fig 9 the higher n adulteration especially the n6 in n bc brought out more c ss which was then beneficial to the path ④ leading to the higher detected maximum amount of cs2 and lower cf during ct dechlorination fig 3c in addition the chloroform radical and trichloromethyl anion was also able to react with sulfides or polysulfides to form sccl3 as shown in paths ⑨ and ⑩ doong and wu 1992 the c ss ccl3 was also able to accept electrons provided by sulfide leading to generation of chloroform radical and trichloromethyl anion path ⑪ the proportions of hs and s2 increased along with the increase of ph value jørgensen et al 2019 therefore the higher ph was in favor of the paths ⑨ and ⑩ while went against the path ③ as a result the yield of cf was lower under higher ph as shown in fig 4b in summary complex processes were involved in n bc catalyzed ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions including catalytic sn2 nucleophilic substitution as major process and catalytic hydrogenolysis as minor process 4 conclusions in this study several n bcs were prepared by re pyrolyzing nitric acid impregnated biochar at different temperatures using alfalfa as raw biomass these n bcs were then demonstrated to be effective in catalyzing ct dechlorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions higher pyrolysis temperature of n bc resulted in larger ssa more pores and as a consequence better catalytic capacity the predominated products of catalytic ct dechlorination were cl cf cs2 and hco3 specifically the concentration of cs2 first increased and then decreased during ct dechlorination the catalytic ct dechlorination was feasible under normal environmental ph range of 6 3 8 3 while higher ph resulted in enhanced catalytic ct removal rate higher dosage of sulfide or n bc 800 was beneficial to catalytic ct dechlorination leading to smaller yield of cf and higher value of maximum detection amount of cs2 besides the n bc 800 had a good tolerance to water matrix in catalyzing ct dechlorination by sulfide the catalytic hydrogenolysis from ct to cf was ascribed to the enhanced electron transfer by n5 gn and quinone hydroquinone in contrast the generation of cs2 was attributed to the nucleophilic substitution by newborn c ss structure generating from the interaction between n6 and sulfide the catalytic sn2 nucleophilic substitution was the major ct dechlorination pathway whereas catalytic hydrogenolysis was the minor dechlorination pathway overall the mediated effects of nitrogen functional groups especially n6 were of great importance to catalytic ct declorination in sulfide containing aqueous solutions this study further confirmed the great potential of n bcs in restoring chs polluted aquatic environments considering that the n bcs were low cost environment friendly and always possess acceptable adsorption of organics further studies would be conducted to establish an n bc 800 capping of sediments and to investigate its long term effects on the control and dechlorination of chs declaration of competing interest the

richardson and plewa 2020 which show potential genotoxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity mazhar et al 2020 wagner and plewa 2017 of the commonly known dbp species trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the two most prevalent groups and are regulated in many countries seidel et al 2017 in recent years with the development of analytical methods dbps such as nitro dbps and aromatic dbps have caused increased concern owing to its higher potential toxicity than regulated dbps for instance database on the us epa s information risk information system iris indicates that for oral exposure n nitrosodimethylamine ndma has a cancer potency 600 times greater than any of the regulated thms besides chronic cytotoxicity tests based on chinese hamster ovarian cells have shown that the chlorophenylacetonitriles cpans are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more cytotoxic than regulated thms and haas zhang et al 2021c zhou et al 2020 to control the formation of dbps some researches have turned to other disinfectants such as chloramine lower yields of thms and haas in chloramination has been reported but other water quality and operational problems were simultaneously observed diehl et al 2000 meanwhile many studies focused on improving the removal of dbp precursors to minimize the dbp formation beauchamp et al 2020 fu et al 2017 wang et al 2013 oxidation process has been frequently researched because conventional water treatments cannot remove dbp precursors effectively application of oxidants was considered to be able to partially remove dbp precursors and have a beneficial influence on the decrease of dbp yields in subsequent disinfection camel and bermond 1998 li et al 2022 as a powerful oxidant ozone was used in water treatment plants to remove or eliminate odor taste and color problems ike et al 2019 phungsai et al 2018 nonetheless ozone decayed rapidly owing to its high reactivity towards organic matters in drinking water so it cannot maintain residual secondary disinfection in distribution system therefore practical application in drinking water treatment often selects chlorine as the secondary disinfectant after ozonation to provide a residual disinfection power for microbial safety of note ozonation can transform the composition and structure of dbp precursors thus the impacts of pre ozonation on dbp formation during subsequent chlorination should be of concern the effects of pre ozonation on the formation of regulated dbps in post chlorination related to the suva254 values specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm which represents the aromaticity of substances of precursors hu et al 2010 hua and reckhow 2007 the yields of thms or haas decreased effectively in chlorination after pre ozonation when suva254 values 2 l mg 1 m 1 jiang et al 2019 mao et al 2018 yet for the waters with low suva254 2 l mg 1 m 1 the effects of pre ozonation on dbp formation were uncertain i e the yields of thms or haas may increase decrease or keep stable yang et al 2012 as for the unregulated dbps pre ozonation enhanced halonitromethane hnm formation dramatically in post chlorination about 4 7 5 6 times increase of trichloroacetonitrile tcnm formation was observed in chlorinated lake water with pre ozonation wang et al 2014 besides pre ozonation led to higher haloketone hk formation potentials in subsequent chlorination whereas the dihaloacetonitrile dhan formation was reduced hua and reckhow 2013 jiang et al 2019 algal organic matter aom which features low suva254 values is generally served as a prominent source of dbp precursors fang et al 2010a fang et al 2010b gonsior et al 2019 hua et al 2019 tomlinson et al 2016 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 given that eutrophication is now a global concern it is necessary to investigate the impacts of pre ozonation on dbp formation for these specific aom related water source up to date studies have mainly focused on the impacts of pre ozonation on the commonly known dbp formation e g thms haas hks and hans additionally some studies paid attention to the changes of potential toxicity after ozonation the effects of ozone on cytotoxicity of wastewaters related to the cumulative disinfectant concentration over time dong et al 2018 some study claimed pre ozonation enhanced ecotoxicity due to the higher formation of aldehydes while other studies reported it reduced the cytotoxicity or genotoxicity dong et al 2016 dong et al 2017 park et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge the influence of pre ozonation on the formation of other unknown chlorinated dbps cl dbps from aom in post chlorination remain uncharacterized most of which could be more toxic than the commonly known dbps besides the synergistic effects of these organic cl dbps can enhance the overall toxicity of the mixture han and zhang 2018 wu et al 2019 thus the formation and potential toxicity implications of these unknown cl dbps still need to further investigate in general by chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis the conversion of fluorescence aromaticity and the changes of overall structures of organic matters during treatments could be reflected qualitatively quantitatively the overall intensities of fluorophores e g protein like organics and the aromaticity of aom decreased to a large extent after ozonation and the high molecular weight compositions was preferentially converted to relatively lower molecular weight chen et al 2017 jin et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a many studies have devoted to establishing correlations between aom derived properties with dbp formation potentials the aromatic and hydrophobic aom were prone to generate trichloromethane tcm and trichloroacetic acid tcaa while the hydrophilic om is the main precursors of dichloroacetonitrile dcan and tcnm sun et al 2018 however the variation of aom at molecular level and the formation of unknown cl dbps in ozonation chlorination treatment are infrequently investigated fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been recognized as a promising non target method to provide molecular level analysis of organic matters by advantage of its ultrahigh resolution and mass spectroscopy accuracy ruan et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2014 the application of ft icr ms could track the alteration of molecular compositions and properties of organic matter and reveal the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts the diversity of unknown cl dbps which associated with the addition of free chlorine to double bond moieties in unsaturated fatty acids was observed in chlorinated aom samples besides macromolecular cl dbps 912 carbonaceous dbps and 736 nitrogenous dbps were detected in chlorination after plasma oxidation and the main cl dbps were the compounds of cyhnomclx with c11 and c18 gonsior et al 2019 wang et al 2022 nonetheless the effects of pre ozonation on the formation of these unknown chlorinated byproducts in subsequent chlorination at molecular level have not been investigated it can be anticipated that by ft icr ms analysis the conversion of molecular composition and the formation or properties of unknown cl dbps for the chlorinated aom samples with or without pre ozonation can be characterized new insights into the role of pre ozonation during subsequent chlorination can be provided using ft icr ms tcm is the first detected dbp in chlorinated drinking water and it is one of the regulated dbps with limitation of 60 μg l 1 in drinking water besides tcm is a kind of commonly detected dbp with a high formation so the changes of tcm formation by ozone can be obvious hence in this study tcm was selected as the model dbp to investigate the impacts of pre ozonation on chlorinated aom samples the overall objective is to systematically assess the impacts of pre ozonation on the formation of unknown cl dbps and potential toxicity during subsequent chlorination using ft icr ms 1 yields of tcm and acute toxicity of the chlorinated samples with without pre ozonation were determined 2 the formation and molecular properties of unknown cl dbps during chlorination with without pre ozonation were investigated 3 the alteration of aom molecular compositions during pre ozonation were identified and characterized to profoundly decipher the effects of ozonation on the dbp precursors the results of this study can provide new insights into the impacts of pre ozonation on the unknown cl dbp formation during subsequent chlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials aom was extracted from microcystis aeruginosa which is the most common algae specie in global eutrophication li et al 2012 the freeze thaw method was used and the extraction procedure is consistent with previous study daly et al 2007 the tcm standard methanol and methyl tertbutyl ether were obtained from sigma aldrich usa other chemicals including sodium hypochlorite sodium sulfite nah2po4 na2hpo4 hydrochloric acid sodium chloride and ascorbic acid were purchased from sinopharm china luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri nrrl b 11177 was purchased from j q environmental technologies co ltd beijing china unless otherwise specified all chemicals involved in this study are of analytical grade or better and all solutions were prepared with deionized milli q water 18 2 mω cm 2 2 experimental procedures before reaction the initial concentration of aom stock solution was diluted to 4 mg l 1 as dissolved organic carbon doc and ph value was kept at 7 5 by 10 mm phosphate buffer ozone was generated using an ozone generator parkoo cl 6k guangzhou china while the ultra high purity oxygen pass through and immediately introduced into the bottom of a bottle with ultrapure water for 10 min ozone stock solution was freshly prepared before each experiment and the concentration of it was confirmed to be 20 mg l 1 by indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 the initial concentration of ozone is 0 1 2 4 6 mg l 1 pre ozonation was conducted in a series of conical flasks with ground glass stopper and each was finally filled with 50 ml solution namely a series of certain ozone stock solution and aom stock solution 0 ml 50 ml 2 5 ml 47 5 ml 5 ml 45 ml 10 ml 40 ml 15 ml 35 ml were added in the flasks immediately after mixing the conical flask was sealed and stirred magnetically for 20 min after reaction the excess ozone was removed by nitrogen stripping for 10 min immediately all samples were post treated with 10 mg l 1 as cl2 for dbp formation potential tests in chlorination processes residual chlorine was ensured around 1 mg l 1 after 24 h after chlorinated samples were quenched with ascorbic acid at a molar ratio of ascorbic acid to chlorine as 1 2 1 then all finished samples were taken for acute toxicity and dbp measurements four samples were collected including aom raw sample sample treated by ozone and the samples for chlorination with or without pre ozonation for ft icr ms analysis the details of sample pretreatment for ft icr ms analysis are shown in text s1 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of doc were measured using a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan the total chlorine and free chlorine concentrations were analyzed by n n diethyl p phenylene diamine colorimetric method using a water quality spectrophotometer hach dr3900 usa tcm formation potentials were quantitatively measured by a gas chromatography with an electron capture detector ecd gc 7900 tianmei china after liquid liquid extraction with methyl tertbutyl ether the instrumental parameters of ft icr ms analysis and the detailed procedure of acute toxicity tests are described in text s2 the acute toxicity of chlorinated samples at various ozone dosages were assessed using bacterial luminescence vibrio fischeri nrrl b 11177 which was measured by a luminometer biofix lumi 10 toxicity analyzer macherey nagel düren germany the toxicity was tested following the standard method iso11348 3 2007 prior to the test freeze dried vibrio fischeri was rehydrated in 6 ml reactivation solution and the reactivated bacteria were kept at 4 c for 5 min then 0 5 ml reactivated bacterial suspension was extracted to the cuvettes after 10 min equilibration at 15 c 0 5 ml control solution was added to the blank control cuvette each solution was added to the sample cuvette successively measurements were then taken to obtain the initial luminescence and the inhibition of luminescence was measured after 30 min 2 4 statistical analysis the data analysis 5 0 bruker daltonics software was applied to assign molecular formulas within 1 ppm mass accuracy under chemical restriction the formulas of cl dbps were further identified according to the isotopic abundance ratio of cl 35cl 37cl 3 1 according to each assigned formulas molecular properties including double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon dbe o c nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc modified aromaticity index aimod and kendrick mass defect kmd were calculated the above parameters can provide the information on the unsaturation oxidation aromaticity and structure properties of organic matters based on previous study the transformation reaction mechanisms of cl dbps can be divided into two types i e substitution reaction sr and addition reaction ar for these assigned cl dbps formulas the possible precursors in aom or ozonated aom samples were identified according to each reaction mechanisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 the impacts of pre ozonation on tcm formation during subsequent chlorination the formation of tcm in chlorination at various ozone dosages is shown in fig 1 a which are 60 15 0 87 42 85 1 79 52 51 2 09 55 90 1 74 and 48 60 1 00 μg l 1 for ozone dosages at 0 1 2 4 and 6 mg l 1 respectively as shown pre ozonation decreased tcm formation in chlorination especially at 1 mg l 1 ozone dose previous studies have claimed the reduction of tcm formation can be rationalized by that ozonation can destruct a considerable part of tcm precursors via breaking down the nucleophilic centers of organic matters hammes et al 2006 von gunten 2003 to evaluate the impacts of pre ozonation on tcm formation in detail the doc and suva254 values were measured fig 1b as shown no obvious change of doc values illustrates ozone has no mineralized effect on aom besides as for suva254 which is a better indicative parameter for tcm formation chen and westerhoff 2010 ged et al 2015 the variation of suva254 is not consistent accurately with the trend of tcm formation potentials therefore to investigate the effects of pre ozonation on tcm formation more profoundly the ft icr ms analysis during pre ozonation was conducted to display the conversion of molecular compositions more markedly during ozonation the determined ozone dose was 1 mg l 1 owing to its maximum decrease of tcm formation about 7500 unique formulas were determined after carefully formula assigned for mass peaks with a signal to noise higher than 6 s n 6 all assigned formulas were divided into four groups namely the removed produced decreased and increased compounds according to the changes of intensity in ozonation the removed or produced means compounds showed only in unozonated or ozonated sample and increased or decreased means compounds showed higher or lower intensity after ozonation the plot of o c extent of oxidation versus h c ratios extent of saturation was to provide information more intuitively on the variation of molecular composition during ozonation fig 1c d as shown the increased or produced compounds distributed differently compared with the decreased or removed compounds obviously compositions with o c values 0 5 were prone to be removed or decreased by ozone comparatively large amounts of compounds with higher o c and lower h c were newly generated and increased it can be explained by the contribution of hydroxyl radical ho which existed in ozonation ho could attack aom by o addition reaction of the c c bonds and h abstraction reaction of the c h bonds to form hydroxylated compounds leading to the increased o c and decreased h c after ozonation goldstone et al 2002 wenk et al 2011 wu et al 2022b our previous study has demonstrated the areas of the removed and decreased groups belong to tcm precursors wu et al 2022a and molecules with higher o c ratio were less reactive toward chlorine than the lower o c zhang et al 2012 thus less tcm precursors as well as lower reactivity towards chlorine lead to the reduction of tcm formation 3 2 changes of acute toxicity for chlorinated aom samples with pre ozonation for a more comprehensive evaluation of the effects of pre ozonation on subsequent chlorination the changes of acute toxicity for chlorinated aom samples at various ozone dosages were analyzed using vibrio fischeri the results are shown in fig 2 and the p values of inhibition rate among different samples are provided in table s1 as shown the inhibition rates increase for all samples with pre ozonation indicating the adverse impacts of pre ozonation on acute toxicity in subsequent chlorination the highest inhibition rate reaches at chlorination with 2 mg l 1 pre ozonation increasing 37 more than that without ozonation the results indicate that although the lower tcm concentration is detected during chlorination with pre ozonation the corresponding acute toxicity increases as known tcm is a high yield of dbps yet the main contributors of potential toxicity generally be that trace nitro like or aromatic like dbps thus a reasonable speculation about the increased acute toxicity is that pre ozonation increases the formation of other cl dbps with higher potential toxicity besides synergistic effects of these chlorinated organic byproducts may occur and thus enhance the overall potential toxicity of the mixture thus to confirm our conjecture and better investigate the impacts of pre ozonation on the formation of unknown cl dbps in subsequent chlorination the ft icr ms analysis for chlorinated samples with without pre ozonation were conducted in following sections 3 3 the formation of cl dbps during chlorination with or without pre ozonation the formation and distribution of cl dbps in chlorination with without pre ozonation are shown in fig 3 a total of 2807 chlorinated formulas were identified as cl dbps in chlorination without pre ozonation including 2478 one chlorine containing compounds 1cl dbps 218 two chlorine containing compounds 2cl dbps and 111 three chlorine containing compounds 3cl dbps meanwhile the number of cl dbps in chlorination with pre ozonation was 3871 among these cl dbps 3318 378 and 175 formulas were assigned as 1cl dbps 2cl dbps and 3cl dbps respectively notably pre ozonation enhanced the amounts of cl dbps during subsequent chlorination for cl dbps an increase of 33 9 73 4 and 57 7 for 1cl dbps 2cl dbps 3cl dbps molecules is observed in chlorination with pre ozonation besides the peak intensity of these cl dbps is generally higher in chlorination with pre ozonation than that without pre ozonation the increasing species and intensity of cl dbps can be explained by molecules with a higher o c ratio were prone to generate cl dbps fig 1c d harris et al 2015 it can also be proved by the consumption of free chlorine in two processes the concentrations of residual chlorine in the samples treated with different ozone doses were determined and are shown in table s2 as shown the residual chlorine in chlorination with 1 mg l 1 ozone or without pre ozonation was 1 06 1 34 mg l 1 indicating more chlorine was consumed in chlorination with pre ozonation to react with aom and participate in the formation of cl dbps the distribution of common exist both in chlorination with without pre ozonation and distinctive cl dbps are shown in fig s1 and table s3 the distinctive 1cl dbps in two treatments from fig s1a occupied in different areas this finding may reflect the different precursors of distinctive 1cl dbps during chlorination with without ozonation 3 4 a closer look on the molecular conversion during pre ozonation the conversion of molecular compositions during pre ozonation were characterized to better explain the increasing formation of cl dbps in chlorination after pre ozonation the clear conversions in ozonation of weighted average values of molecular weight mw 426 to 392 and dbe 8 26 to 7 49 were observed table s4 as shown in fig s2 molecules degraded from high mw compounds increased the amounts of low mw compounds which have been reported in many previous studies liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021c the value of dbe generally represents the sum of double bonds and rings the reduction of dbew means the double bonds and rings were attacked by reactive oxidants during ozonation inducing double bond breakage and ring opening to produce low mw organic compounds the increase of such low mw aom compositions after ozonation may contain precursors of cl dbps thereby enhancing the formation of cl dbps gang et al 2003 liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021c to visualize the conversion of molecular compositions more intuitively and specifically the dbe o c versus nosc plot is shown in fig 4 dbe o c and nosc are the parameters that can measure the extent of unsaturation and oxidation where larger positive value represents a higher extent of unsaturation and oxidation zhang et al 2021a according to the values of dbe o c and nosc compounds can be divided into four groups namely i unsaturated and oxidized compounds dbe o c 0 and nosc 0 ii unsaturated and reduced compounds dbe o c 0 and nosc 0 iii saturated and reduced compounds dbe o c 0 and nosc 0 and iv saturated and oxidized compounds dbe o c 0 and nosc 0 from the results in fig 4b the unsaturated reduced compounds were prone to transform into saturated oxidized compounds during ozonation it was generally acknowledged that ozone o3 and ho are the two main oxidants during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reactivity of the two oxidants with aom depends on its composition for example aom with more unsaturated double bonds is more reactive with o3 and aom with a higher phenolic content and higher electron donating capacity is a potent o3 scavenger phungsai et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 comparatively ho is a less selective oxidant and reacts with most water constituents both o3 and ho react with high aromatic and reduced formulas while ho also oxidizes more saturated structures such as c c bonds or c h bonds von gunten 2003 therefore the unsaturated and reduced compounds in group ii converted to saturated and oxidized compounds in ozonation reactions between aom and o3 e g addition of one to two oxygen atoms or ho e g addition of one oxygen atom and decarboxylation produced amounts of highly oxidized compositions with functional groups e g aldehydic ketonic and carboxylic hammes et al 2006 remucal et al 2020 wert et al 2007 the partially oxidized intermediates can serve as dbp precursors for instance aldehydes compounds can participate in the formation of hans cyanogen chloride cncl and trichloronitromethane tcnm in subsequent chlorination by a series of elimination and substitution reaction wert and rosario ortiz 2013 yang et al 2010 to investigate the effects of pre ozonation on dbp precursors the specific possible precursors of cl dbps were tracked it means the atoms in cl dbps cxhyoznicln were added or subtracted to form new molecules according to seven transformation reaction cl h 2cl 2h clo h hclo cl2o h2cl2o2 and cl2o3 2h zhang et al 2021b if these molecules could be found in aom samples with without pre ozonation these molecules were proposed to be the specific possible precursors of cl dbps of note each precursor or product can participate in various reactions due to the complex transformation reaction systems causing each precursor could be related with 1 to 7 products or each product could be generated from 1 to 5 precursors the numbers of precursor product pairs for each transformation reaction in two treatments are displayed in radar chart fig s3 and table s5 the results show that cl h clo h and hclo are the three main transformation reactions in subsequent chlorination and pre ozonation significantly increases the possible precursor product pairs for each transformation reaction in total 1690 molecules were identified as cl dbp precursors in unozonated sample whereas 2304 molecules in ozonated sample among these precursors a total of 1496 common molecules were observed it means 808 precursors were newly produced after ozonation thereby increasing the cl dbp formation in subsequent chlorination the distribution of common or distinct precursors in van krevelen diagram is shown in fig s4 to visually show the distribution of precursors the density plots of cl dbp precursors in two treatments are displayed in fig 5 because the same h c and o c ratio of different chemical formulas could occupy the common dots in van krevelen diagram precursors in two systems roughly exhibit in a same area yet the higher density is found after ozonation which indicates more precursors exist in ozonated sample it can be observed there is no difference in two areas on the h c axis while after ozonation such oxidized compounds with relatively higher o c ratios become the new precursors of cl dbps 3 5 the molecular properties of cl dbps in chlorination with pre ozonation large amounts of cl dbps were detected during chlorination with pre ozonation to threaten human health hence to provide theoretical guidance for controlling the cl dbp formation in practical application the molecular properties of these cl dbps were further investigated the kmd analysis was utilized to obtain more information of molecular structure of cl dbps fig s5 as known molecules on the same horizontal kmd level is a homogenous series where larger kendrick nominal mass values suggest a higher repetition of their functional groups gaiffe et al 2018 the results show that 1cl dbps own more ch2 structures and belong to higher mw compositions than 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps compounds fig s5 the phenomenon can also be explained by the carbon numbers of 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps is less than 25 while large amounts of 1cl dbps formulas with carbon numbers of 25 40 are formed fig s6 additionally the differences of molecular properties were investigated according to the distribution of cl dbps in dbe o c nosc plot fig 6 and table s6 1cl dbps mainly occupy in i and ii groups which belong to the unsaturated compounds one can see that the values of dbew of 1cl dbps 11 67 were significantly higher than 2cl dbps 4 93 or 3cl dbps 3 08 fig s6 it further corroborates more unsaturated compounds in 1cl dbps rather than in 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps compared with 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps lots of 1cl dbps with dbe o c values of 0 2 0 7 and nosc values of 1 1 0 3 were generated which were generally considered as polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compositions hao et al 2017 these condensed aromatic compounds may contribute to the high potential toxicity instead 3cl dbps were more likely to be saturated compounds due to its main distribution in iii and iv areas and it can also be reflected by the lowest dbew and highest h c in three cl dbps species fig s6 and fig s7a comparatively most 2cl dbps compounds are oxidated state with its highest o c value in three cl dbps species fig s7b 4 conclusions the study investigated the impacts of pre ozonation on cl dbp formation and potential toxicity during subsequent chlorination the main conclusions could be summarized as follows 1 pre ozonation decreased tcm formation in subsequent chlorination while it enhanced acute toxicity of treated solution and the generation of other unknown cl dbps 2 by analysis of the possible precursor product pairs approximately 808 cl dbp precursors newly generated in ozonated sample leading to the higher yield of cl dbps in chlorination with pre ozonation than that without pre ozonation 3 1cl dbps were unsaturated molecules with high dbew molecular weight and more ch2 structures while 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps were mainly oxidized or saturated compounds 4 a large proportion of 1cl dbps molecules associated with polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compositions generated which may be the main potential toxicity contributor due to its high aromaticity in this study the acute toxicity formation and the molecular properties of the unknown cl dbps in chlorinated aom samples with pre ozonation were primarily explored a comprehensive toxicity assessment system based on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of these unknown cl dbps should be established to evaluate the production and potential toxicity implications and more detailed features of these unknown cl dbps should be further

15589,formation of unknown chlorinated disinfection byproducts cl dbps during chlorination gradually raised great concern and pre oxidation was considered as an efficient method to minimize cl dbp formation in this study pre ozonation of algal organic matter was investigated to explore its impacts on cl dbp formation and acute toxicity during subsequent chlorination with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analysis the conversion of algal organic matter in chlorination with without pre ozonation was tracked the results show that pre ozonation reduced the formation of trichloromethane tcm yet the species and intensity of unknown cl dbps were significantly increased in subsequent chlorination meanwhile the solution acute toxicity was higher in chlorination with pre ozonation than in chlorination only besides molecular properties of these unknown cl dbps were further explored and featured one chlorine containing dbps were unsaturated high molecular weight compounds with more ch2 structures while two or three chlorine containing dbps were mainly oxidized or saturated compounds of note large amounts of one chlorine containing dbps related to polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compositions were generated which may contribute to the high potential toxicity overall the findings of this study could provide new insights into the impacts of pre ozonation on the formation of unknown cl dbps and potential toxicity during chlorination for actual application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aom cl dbps pre ozonation ft icr ms acute toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to establish a protective barrier of human health towards waterborne diseases drinking water disinfection is generally believed to be the critical step in conventional water treatments li and mitch 2018 among the various disinfectants chlorine has been globally implemented for more than 100 years by advantage of its easy accessibility and low cost negreira et al 2016 however more than 700 undesirable halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps have been detected during disinfection richardson and plewa 2020 which show potential genotoxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity mazhar et al 2020 wagner and plewa 2017 of the commonly known dbp species trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the two most prevalent groups and are regulated in many countries seidel et al 2017 in recent years with the development of analytical methods dbps such as nitro dbps and aromatic dbps have caused increased concern owing to its higher potential toxicity than regulated dbps for instance database on the us epa s information risk information system iris indicates that for oral exposure n nitrosodimethylamine ndma has a cancer potency 600 times greater than any of the regulated thms besides chronic cytotoxicity tests based on chinese hamster ovarian cells have shown that the chlorophenylacetonitriles cpans are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more cytotoxic than regulated thms and haas zhang et al 2021c zhou et al 2020 to control the formation of dbps some researches have turned to other disinfectants such as chloramine lower yields of thms and haas in chloramination has been reported but other water quality and operational problems were simultaneously observed diehl et al 2000 meanwhile many studies focused on improving the removal of dbp precursors to minimize the dbp formation beauchamp et al 2020 fu et al 2017 wang et al 2013 oxidation process has been frequently researched because conventional water treatments cannot remove dbp precursors effectively application of oxidants was considered to be able to partially remove dbp precursors and have a beneficial influence on the decrease of dbp yields in subsequent disinfection camel and bermond 1998 li et al 2022 as a powerful oxidant ozone was used in water treatment plants to remove or eliminate odor taste and color problems ike et al 2019 phungsai et al 2018 nonetheless ozone decayed rapidly owing to its high reactivity towards organic matters in drinking water so it cannot maintain residual secondary disinfection in distribution system therefore practical application in drinking water treatment often selects chlorine as the secondary disinfectant after ozonation to provide a residual disinfection power for microbial safety of note ozonation can transform the composition and structure of dbp precursors thus the impacts of pre ozonation on dbp formation during subsequent chlorination should be of concern the effects of pre ozonation on the formation of regulated dbps in post chlorination related to the suva254 values specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm which represents the aromaticity of substances of precursors hu et al 2010 hua and reckhow 2007 the yields of thms or haas decreased effectively in chlorination after pre ozonation when suva254 values 2 l mg 1 m 1 jiang et al 2019 mao et al 2018 yet for the waters with low suva254 2 l mg 1 m 1 the effects of pre ozonation on dbp formation were uncertain i e the yields of thms or haas may increase decrease or keep stable yang et al 2012 as for the unregulated dbps pre ozonation enhanced halonitromethane hnm formation dramatically in post chlorination about 4 7 5 6 times increase of trichloroacetonitrile tcnm formation was observed in chlorinated lake water with pre ozonation wang et al 2014 besides pre ozonation led to higher haloketone hk formation potentials in subsequent chlorination whereas the dihaloacetonitrile dhan formation was reduced hua and reckhow 2013 jiang et al 2019 algal organic matter aom which features low suva254 values is generally served as a prominent source of dbp precursors fang et al 2010a fang et al 2010b gonsior et al 2019 hua et al 2019 tomlinson et al 2016 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 given that eutrophication is now a global concern it is necessary to investigate the impacts of pre ozonation on dbp formation for these specific aom related water source up to date studies have mainly focused on the impacts of pre ozonation on the commonly known dbp formation e g thms haas hks and hans additionally some studies paid attention to the changes of potential toxicity after ozonation the effects of ozone on cytotoxicity of wastewaters related to the cumulative disinfectant concentration over time dong et al 2018 some study claimed pre ozonation enhanced ecotoxicity due to the higher formation of aldehydes while other studies reported it reduced the cytotoxicity or genotoxicity dong et al 2016 dong et al 2017 park et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge the influence of pre ozonation on the formation of other unknown chlorinated dbps cl dbps from aom in post chlorination remain uncharacterized most of which could be more toxic than the commonly known dbps besides the synergistic effects of these organic cl dbps can enhance the overall toxicity of the mixture han and zhang 2018 wu et al 2019 thus the formation and potential toxicity implications of these unknown cl dbps still need to further investigate in general by chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis the conversion of fluorescence aromaticity and the changes of overall structures of organic matters during treatments could be reflected qualitatively quantitatively the overall intensities of fluorophores e g protein like organics and the aromaticity of aom decreased to a large extent after ozonation and the high molecular weight compositions was preferentially converted to relatively lower molecular weight chen et al 2017 jin et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a many studies have devoted to establishing correlations between aom derived properties with dbp formation potentials the aromatic and hydrophobic aom were prone to generate trichloromethane tcm and trichloroacetic acid tcaa while the hydrophilic om is the main precursors of dichloroacetonitrile dcan and tcnm sun et al 2018 however the variation of aom at molecular level and the formation of unknown cl dbps in ozonation chlorination treatment are infrequently investigated fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been recognized as a promising non target method to provide molecular level analysis of organic matters by advantage of its ultrahigh resolution and mass spectroscopy accuracy ruan et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2014 the application of ft icr ms could track the alteration of molecular compositions and properties of organic matter and reveal the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts the diversity of unknown cl dbps which associated with the addition of free chlorine to double bond moieties in unsaturated fatty acids was observed in chlorinated aom samples besides macromolecular cl dbps 912 carbonaceous dbps and 736 nitrogenous dbps were detected in chlorination after plasma oxidation and the main cl dbps were the compounds of cyhnomclx with c11 and c18 gonsior et al 2019 wang et al 2022 nonetheless the effects of pre ozonation on the formation of these unknown chlorinated byproducts in subsequent chlorination at molecular level have not been investigated it can be anticipated that by ft icr ms analysis the conversion of molecular composition and the formation or properties of unknown cl dbps for the chlorinated aom samples with or without pre ozonation can be characterized new insights into the role of pre ozonation during subsequent chlorination can be provided using ft icr ms tcm is the first detected dbp in chlorinated drinking water and it is one of the regulated dbps with limitation of 60 μg l 1 in drinking water besides tcm is a kind of commonly detected dbp with a high formation so the changes of tcm formation by ozone can be obvious hence in this study tcm was selected as the model dbp to investigate the impacts of pre ozonation on chlorinated aom samples the overall objective is to systematically assess the impacts of pre ozonation on the formation of unknown cl dbps and potential toxicity during subsequent chlorination using ft icr ms 1 yields of tcm and acute toxicity of the chlorinated samples with without pre ozonation were determined 2 the formation and molecular properties of unknown cl dbps during chlorination with without pre ozonation were investigated 3 the alteration of aom molecular compositions during pre ozonation were identified and characterized to profoundly decipher the effects of ozonation on the dbp precursors the results of this study can provide new insights into the impacts of pre ozonation on the unknown cl dbp formation during subsequent chlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials aom was extracted from microcystis aeruginosa which is the most common algae specie in global eutrophication li et al 2012 the freeze thaw method was used and the extraction procedure is consistent with previous study daly et al 2007 the tcm standard methanol and methyl tertbutyl ether were obtained from sigma aldrich usa other chemicals including sodium hypochlorite sodium sulfite nah2po4 na2hpo4 hydrochloric acid sodium chloride and ascorbic acid were purchased from sinopharm china luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri nrrl b 11177 was purchased from j q environmental technologies co ltd beijing china unless otherwise specified all chemicals involved in this study are of analytical grade or better and all solutions were prepared with deionized milli q water 18 2 mω cm 2 2 experimental procedures before reaction the initial concentration of aom stock solution was diluted to 4 mg l 1 as dissolved organic carbon doc and ph value was kept at 7 5 by 10 mm phosphate buffer ozone was generated using an ozone generator parkoo cl 6k guangzhou china while the ultra high purity oxygen pass through and immediately introduced into the bottom of a bottle with ultrapure water for 10 min ozone stock solution was freshly prepared before each experiment and the concentration of it was confirmed to be 20 mg l 1 by indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 the initial concentration of ozone is 0 1 2 4 6 mg l 1 pre ozonation was conducted in a series of conical flasks with ground glass stopper and each was finally filled with 50 ml solution namely a series of certain ozone stock solution and aom stock solution 0 ml 50 ml 2 5 ml 47 5 ml 5 ml 45 ml 10 ml 40 ml 15 ml 35 ml were added in the flasks immediately after mixing the conical flask was sealed and stirred magnetically for 20 min after reaction the excess ozone was removed by nitrogen stripping for 10 min immediately all samples were post treated with 10 mg l 1 as cl2 for dbp formation potential tests in chlorination processes residual chlorine was ensured around 1 mg l 1 after 24 h after chlorinated samples were quenched with ascorbic acid at a molar ratio of ascorbic acid to chlorine as 1 2 1 then all finished samples were taken for acute toxicity and dbp measurements four samples were collected including aom raw sample sample treated by ozone and the samples for chlorination with or without pre ozonation for ft icr ms analysis the details of sample pretreatment for ft icr ms analysis are shown in text s1 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of doc were measured using a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan the total chlorine and free chlorine concentrations were analyzed by n n diethyl p phenylene diamine colorimetric method using a water quality spectrophotometer hach dr3900 usa tcm formation potentials were quantitatively measured by a gas chromatography with an electron capture detector ecd gc 7900 tianmei china after liquid liquid extraction with methyl tertbutyl ether the instrumental parameters of ft icr ms analysis and the detailed procedure of acute toxicity tests are described in text s2 the acute toxicity of chlorinated samples at various ozone dosages were assessed using bacterial luminescence vibrio fischeri nrrl b 11177 which was measured by a luminometer biofix lumi 10 toxicity analyzer macherey nagel düren germany the toxicity was tested following the standard method iso11348 3 2007 prior to the test freeze dried vibrio fischeri was rehydrated in 6 ml reactivation solution and the reactivated bacteria were kept at 4 c for 5 min then 0 5 ml reactivated bacterial suspension was extracted to the cuvettes after 10 min equilibration at 15 c 0 5 ml control solution was added to the blank control cuvette each solution was added to the sample cuvette successively measurements were then taken to obtain the initial luminescence and the inhibition of luminescence was measured after 30 min 2 4 statistical analysis the data analysis 5 0 bruker daltonics software was applied to assign molecular formulas within 1 ppm mass accuracy under chemical restriction the formulas of cl dbps were further identified according to the isotopic abundance ratio of cl 35cl 37cl 3 1 according to each assigned formulas molecular properties including double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon dbe o c nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc modified aromaticity index aimod and kendrick mass defect kmd were calculated the above parameters can provide the information on the unsaturation oxidation aromaticity and structure properties of organic matters based on previous study the transformation reaction mechanisms of cl dbps can be divided into two types i e substitution reaction sr and addition reaction ar for these assigned cl dbps formulas the possible precursors in aom or ozonated aom samples were identified according to each reaction mechanisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 the impacts of pre ozonation on tcm formation during subsequent chlorination the formation of tcm in chlorination at various ozone dosages is shown in fig 1 a which are 60 15 0 87 42 85 1 79 52 51 2 09 55 90 1 74 and 48 60 1 00 μg l 1 for ozone dosages at 0 1 2 4 and 6 mg l 1 respectively as shown pre ozonation decreased tcm formation in chlorination especially at 1 mg l 1 ozone dose previous studies have claimed the reduction of tcm formation can be rationalized by that ozonation can destruct a considerable part of tcm precursors via breaking down the nucleophilic centers of organic matters hammes et al 2006 von gunten 2003 to evaluate the impacts of pre ozonation on tcm formation in detail the doc and suva254 values were measured fig 1b as shown no obvious change of doc values illustrates ozone has no mineralized effect on aom besides as for suva254 which is a better indicative parameter for tcm formation chen and westerhoff 2010 ged et al 2015 the variation of suva254 is not consistent accurately with the trend of tcm formation potentials therefore to investigate the effects of pre ozonation on tcm formation more profoundly the ft icr ms analysis during pre ozonation was conducted to display the conversion of molecular compositions more markedly during ozonation the determined ozone dose was 1 mg l 1 owing to its maximum decrease of tcm formation about 7500 unique formulas were determined after carefully formula assigned for mass peaks with a signal to noise higher than 6 s n 6 all assigned formulas were divided into four groups namely the removed produced decreased and increased compounds according to the changes of intensity in ozonation the removed or produced means compounds showed only in unozonated or ozonated sample and increased or decreased means compounds showed higher or lower intensity after ozonation the plot of o c extent of oxidation versus h c ratios extent of saturation was to provide information more intuitively on the variation of molecular composition during ozonation fig 1c d as shown the increased or produced compounds distributed differently compared with the decreased or removed compounds obviously compositions with o c values 0 5 were prone to be removed or decreased by ozone comparatively large amounts of compounds with higher o c and lower h c were newly generated and increased it can be explained by the contribution of hydroxyl radical ho which existed in ozonation ho could attack aom by o addition reaction of the c c bonds and h abstraction reaction of the c h bonds to form hydroxylated compounds leading to the increased o c and decreased h c after ozonation goldstone et al 2002 wenk et al 2011 wu et al 2022b our previous study has demonstrated the areas of the removed and decreased groups belong to tcm precursors wu et al 2022a and molecules with higher o c ratio were less reactive toward chlorine than the lower o c zhang et al 2012 thus less tcm precursors as well as lower reactivity towards chlorine lead to the reduction of tcm formation 3 2 changes of acute toxicity for chlorinated aom samples with pre ozonation for a more comprehensive evaluation of the effects of pre ozonation on subsequent chlorination the changes of acute toxicity for chlorinated aom samples at various ozone dosages were analyzed using vibrio fischeri the results are shown in fig 2 and the p values of inhibition rate among different samples are provided in table s1 as shown the inhibition rates increase for all samples with pre ozonation indicating the adverse impacts of pre ozonation on acute toxicity in subsequent chlorination the highest inhibition rate reaches at chlorination with 2 mg l 1 pre ozonation increasing 37 more than that without ozonation the results indicate that although the lower tcm concentration is detected during chlorination with pre ozonation the corresponding acute toxicity increases as known tcm is a high yield of dbps yet the main contributors of potential toxicity generally be that trace nitro like or aromatic like dbps thus a reasonable speculation about the increased acute toxicity is that pre ozonation increases the formation of other cl dbps with higher potential toxicity besides synergistic effects of these chlorinated organic byproducts may occur and thus enhance the overall potential toxicity of the mixture thus to confirm our conjecture and better investigate the impacts of pre ozonation on the formation of unknown cl dbps in subsequent chlorination the ft icr ms analysis for chlorinated samples with without pre ozonation were conducted in following sections 3 3 the formation of cl dbps during chlorination with or without pre ozonation the formation and distribution of cl dbps in chlorination with without pre ozonation are shown in fig 3 a total of 2807 chlorinated formulas were identified as cl dbps in chlorination without pre ozonation including 2478 one chlorine containing compounds 1cl dbps 218 two chlorine containing compounds 2cl dbps and 111 three chlorine containing compounds 3cl dbps meanwhile the number of cl dbps in chlorination with pre ozonation was 3871 among these cl dbps 3318 378 and 175 formulas were assigned as 1cl dbps 2cl dbps and 3cl dbps respectively notably pre ozonation enhanced the amounts of cl dbps during subsequent chlorination for cl dbps an increase of 33 9 73 4 and 57 7 for 1cl dbps 2cl dbps 3cl dbps molecules is observed in chlorination with pre ozonation besides the peak intensity of these cl dbps is generally higher in chlorination with pre ozonation than that without pre ozonation the increasing species and intensity of cl dbps can be explained by molecules with a higher o c ratio were prone to generate cl dbps fig 1c d harris et al 2015 it can also be proved by the consumption of free chlorine in two processes the concentrations of residual chlorine in the samples treated with different ozone doses were determined and are shown in table s2 as shown the residual chlorine in chlorination with 1 mg l 1 ozone or without pre ozonation was 1 06 1 34 mg l 1 indicating more chlorine was consumed in chlorination with pre ozonation to react with aom and participate in the formation of cl dbps the distribution of common exist both in chlorination with without pre ozonation and distinctive cl dbps are shown in fig s1 and table s3 the distinctive 1cl dbps in two treatments from fig s1a occupied in different areas this finding may reflect the different precursors of distinctive 1cl dbps during chlorination with without ozonation 3 4 a closer look on the molecular conversion during pre ozonation the conversion of molecular compositions during pre ozonation were characterized to better explain the increasing formation of cl dbps in chlorination after pre ozonation the clear conversions in ozonation of weighted average values of molecular weight mw 426 to 392 and dbe 8 26 to 7 49 were observed table s4 as shown in fig s2 molecules degraded from high mw compounds increased the amounts of low mw compounds which have been reported in many previous studies liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021c the value of dbe generally represents the sum of double bonds and rings the reduction of dbew means the double bonds and rings were attacked by reactive oxidants during ozonation inducing double bond breakage and ring opening to produce low mw organic compounds the increase of such low mw aom compositions after ozonation may contain precursors of cl dbps thereby enhancing the formation of cl dbps gang et al 2003 liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021c to visualize the conversion of molecular compositions more intuitively and specifically the dbe o c versus nosc plot is shown in fig 4 dbe o c and nosc are the parameters that can measure the extent of unsaturation and oxidation where larger positive value represents a higher extent of unsaturation and oxidation zhang et al 2021a according to the values of dbe o c and nosc compounds can be divided into four groups namely i unsaturated and oxidized compounds dbe o c 0 and nosc 0 ii unsaturated and reduced compounds dbe o c 0 and nosc 0 iii saturated and reduced compounds dbe o c 0 and nosc 0 and iv saturated and oxidized compounds dbe o c 0 and nosc 0 from the results in fig 4b the unsaturated reduced compounds were prone to transform into saturated oxidized compounds during ozonation it was generally acknowledged that ozone o3 and ho are the two main oxidants during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reactivity of the two oxidants with aom depends on its composition for example aom with more unsaturated double bonds is more reactive with o3 and aom with a higher phenolic content and higher electron donating capacity is a potent o3 scavenger phungsai et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 comparatively ho is a less selective oxidant and reacts with most water constituents both o3 and ho react with high aromatic and reduced formulas while ho also oxidizes more saturated structures such as c c bonds or c h bonds von gunten 2003 therefore the unsaturated and reduced compounds in group ii converted to saturated and oxidized compounds in ozonation reactions between aom and o3 e g addition of one to two oxygen atoms or ho e g addition of one oxygen atom and decarboxylation produced amounts of highly oxidized compositions with functional groups e g aldehydic ketonic and carboxylic hammes et al 2006 remucal et al 2020 wert et al 2007 the partially oxidized intermediates can serve as dbp precursors for instance aldehydes compounds can participate in the formation of hans cyanogen chloride cncl and trichloronitromethane tcnm in subsequent chlorination by a series of elimination and substitution reaction wert and rosario ortiz 2013 yang et al 2010 to investigate the effects of pre ozonation on dbp precursors the specific possible precursors of cl dbps were tracked it means the atoms in cl dbps cxhyoznicln were added or subtracted to form new molecules according to seven transformation reaction cl h 2cl 2h clo h hclo cl2o h2cl2o2 and cl2o3 2h zhang et al 2021b if these molecules could be found in aom samples with without pre ozonation these molecules were proposed to be the specific possible precursors of cl dbps of note each precursor or product can participate in various reactions due to the complex transformation reaction systems causing each precursor could be related with 1 to 7 products or each product could be generated from 1 to 5 precursors the numbers of precursor product pairs for each transformation reaction in two treatments are displayed in radar chart fig s3 and table s5 the results show that cl h clo h and hclo are the three main transformation reactions in subsequent chlorination and pre ozonation significantly increases the possible precursor product pairs for each transformation reaction in total 1690 molecules were identified as cl dbp precursors in unozonated sample whereas 2304 molecules in ozonated sample among these precursors a total of 1496 common molecules were observed it means 808 precursors were newly produced after ozonation thereby increasing the cl dbp formation in subsequent chlorination the distribution of common or distinct precursors in van krevelen diagram is shown in fig s4 to visually show the distribution of precursors the density plots of cl dbp precursors in two treatments are displayed in fig 5 because the same h c and o c ratio of different chemical formulas could occupy the common dots in van krevelen diagram precursors in two systems roughly exhibit in a same area yet the higher density is found after ozonation which indicates more precursors exist in ozonated sample it can be observed there is no difference in two areas on the h c axis while after ozonation such oxidized compounds with relatively higher o c ratios become the new precursors of cl dbps 3 5 the molecular properties of cl dbps in chlorination with pre ozonation large amounts of cl dbps were detected during chlorination with pre ozonation to threaten human health hence to provide theoretical guidance for controlling the cl dbp formation in practical application the molecular properties of these cl dbps were further investigated the kmd analysis was utilized to obtain more information of molecular structure of cl dbps fig s5 as known molecules on the same horizontal kmd level is a homogenous series where larger kendrick nominal mass values suggest a higher repetition of their functional groups gaiffe et al 2018 the results show that 1cl dbps own more ch2 structures and belong to higher mw compositions than 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps compounds fig s5 the phenomenon can also be explained by the carbon numbers of 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps is less than 25 while large amounts of 1cl dbps formulas with carbon numbers of 25 40 are formed fig s6 additionally the differences of molecular properties were investigated according to the distribution of cl dbps in dbe o c nosc plot fig 6 and table s6 1cl dbps mainly occupy in i and ii groups which belong to the unsaturated compounds one can see that the values of dbew of 1cl dbps 11 67 were significantly higher than 2cl dbps 4 93 or 3cl dbps 3 08 fig s6 it further corroborates more unsaturated compounds in 1cl dbps rather than in 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps compared with 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps lots of 1cl dbps with dbe o c values of 0 2 0 7 and nosc values of 1 1 0 3 were generated which were generally considered as polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compositions hao et al 2017 these condensed aromatic compounds may contribute to the high potential toxicity instead 3cl dbps were more likely to be saturated compounds due to its main distribution in iii and iv areas and it can also be reflected by the lowest dbew and highest h c in three cl dbps species fig s6 and fig s7a comparatively most 2cl dbps compounds are oxidated state with its highest o c value in three cl dbps species fig s7b 4 conclusions the study investigated the impacts of pre ozonation on cl dbp formation and potential toxicity during subsequent chlorination the main conclusions could be summarized as follows 1 pre ozonation decreased tcm formation in subsequent chlorination while it enhanced acute toxicity of treated solution and the generation of other unknown cl dbps 2 by analysis of the possible precursor product pairs approximately 808 cl dbp precursors newly generated in ozonated sample leading to the higher yield of cl dbps in chlorination with pre ozonation than that without pre ozonation 3 1cl dbps were unsaturated molecules with high dbew molecular weight and more ch2 structures while 2cl dbps or 3cl dbps were mainly oxidized or saturated compounds 4 a large proportion of 1cl dbps molecules associated with polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compositions generated which may be the main potential toxicity contributor due to its high aromaticity in this study the acute toxicity formation and the molecular properties of the unknown cl dbps in chlorinated aom samples with pre ozonation were primarily explored a comprehensive toxicity assessment system based on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of these unknown cl dbps should be established to evaluate the production and potential toxicity implications and more detailed features of these unknown cl dbps should be further
