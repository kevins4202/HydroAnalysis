8670,water policy requires well established metrics for success precise metrics allow for quantifying progress and adjusting processes to produce the desired outcomes we analyze the different schools of thought nomenclatures and indicators developed for tracking water for human activities after comparing a variety of terms related to water accounting used to serve the different purposes environmental vs ecological economics we found that the different approaches to water tracking utilize identical terms to refer to distinctive concepts the characterization of widely used terms such as water use varies across different branches of literature different approaches to water measurement and its efficiency have an impact on water allocation our paper points out that the current definitions and methods for tracking water for human activities may offer contradictory advice over whether progress is being made towards desirable objectives which may differ across stakeholders this review aims at helping the transfer of academic results to empirical decision making by discerning the differences among the variety of indicators available in the literature and their empirical implications the ambiguity in the water terminology should be clarified before policy decisions can be useful in practice for guiding actions graphical abstract image 1 keywords water use water consumption water withdrawal water efficiency water footprint policymaking 1 introduction the shared and multifaceted nature of water makes the water accounting an interdisciplinary field of study that can be addressed at different scales in different sectors and from different perspectives as academics policy makers and water stakeholders realise the limitations of water in present and in future climate challenged scenarios the qualitative and quantitative tools for water assessment have exploded over the last twenty years life cycle assessment lca water footprint wf environmental performance index to name just a few different accounting frames exist at the level of process product and organization 1 2 for a consumer or group of consumers from the consumption perspective 1 and

management unit e g irrigation scheme or combination of all of these units 1 3 5 water policy requires well established metrics for success because without a clear indication of the size of a problem there is no reason to act to solve it policy makers define the rules and incentives which define the allocation of water among competing needs at the same time water users with competing demands think of any economic activity dependent on the use of water farmers industry urban recreational energy etc but also the natural world as a whole or in a particular geographical area are affected by water allocations precise metrics allow for quantifying progress and adjusting processes to produce the desired outcomes in this paper we review compare and contrast the theoretical frameworks taxonomies nomenclatures and indicators used for helping tracking water for human activities all of them aim at being relevant for water policymaking we delve into the literatures dealing with water for agriculture and water for energy the two human activities most dependent on water availability we illustrate with examples some cases where the same nomenclature is used to refer to different concepts for instance water use we argue that the ambiguity of the academic tools for water assessment needs to be resolved before any of them are in a real position to be able to alter the behavior of water stakeholders 2 material and methods tracking water for human activities is a broad and cross cutting area of research this critical review paper explains the topic in detail based on previously published research we carried out a bibliometric analysis in web of science wos for the period 1990 2020 first we ran a query by topic using water accounting as the keyword in all databases and collections available on the web of science platform as a result we obtained 457 scientific publications showing a very significant increase from mid 2000 onwards fig 1 second we broadened our search by launching queries on a wide variety of water tracking related terms such as water consumption water footprint water withdrawal virtual water and water efficiency this search resulted in more than 32 000 studies according to wos publications containing the term water consumption were the most representative of the sample that is more than 65 over the period analysed followed by those studies including the term water footprint i e more than 10 from 2013 to present research containing the terms water withdrawal virtual water and water efficiency were only representative in the second half of the reporting period fig 2 all these papers have a core common worry they all attempt to track water for human activities but how different are their theoretical approaches to tracking water do they use similar taxonomies do their concepts overlap or contradict each other do the tools and indicators used result in similar policy implications these are the core questions guiding our enquire into the literature the comparative method so called is the process of comparing groups which are similar and yet which differ in known ways conventionally comparative analysis emphasized on the explanation of differences and the explanation of similarities in this paper we will analyze differences and similarities in ontology epistemology methodology methods and data sources of the key strands identified in our bibliometric analysis of water tracking related literature and how they inform and influence each other 3 theoretical approaches used for tracking water approaches to water accounting may vary to serve the different purposes and usually come from two distinct approaches environmental vs ecological economics environmental economics school of thought follows neoclassical economics in viewing the environment as a subset of the economy and having as its central concerns the problem of environmental externalities and the efficient allocation of scarce resources among competing uses 6 7 it addresses issues of pollution control the efficient setting of emission standards waste management and recycling the industrial activity of environmental externalities the conservation of natural resources the valuation of natural resources and so on the objective of environmental economics is to identify policies which will move the economic system towards an efficient allocation of natural resources environmental economics is distinct from ecological economics to the extent that it adheres more closely to conventional neoclassical economics that is it emphasizes the desirability of attaining environmental objectives by means of using market mechanisms like adjusting price signals in order to influence the behavior of households and firms there is however a significant overlap between environmental and ecological economics 7 in contrast the ecological economics views the human economy as a subset of the biosphere and focuses on the sustainable management and relationships of the economic and ecological systems accounting for both the financial constraints on consumption and for natural constraints implied by the wastes of production and consumption 7 9 these constraints which do not necessarily bind in the present but may reduce the capacity of the economic ecological system to provide for human wellbeing in the future are particularly relevant to sustainability and sustainable development humans are considered to be a major component of the overall economic ecological ecosystem rather than being the dominant and central components human society is thought of as co evolving with the natural world sustainable management of the economic and ecological system is one of the major focuses of ecological economics and the time frame of the analysis is typically longer than that considered in conventional economic analysis though overlapping in some areas environmental and ecological approaches have different purposes which require distinct assumptions and measures these two distinct approaches to the evaluation of human interaction with the natural world also differ in what is considered efficient table 1 summaries the different concepts of efficiency which also impact the efficiency and improvement policies in water used for benchmarking and evaluation we examine in the next section key to the evaluation of the efficiency in these different approaches is that while economic efficiency tends to be measured in monetary units eco efficiency is usually measured in quantities of resources only the pareto efficiency may be measured in quantities no alternative allocation of water at a given place and time would make at least one stakeholder better off without making someone else worse off 4 taxonomies concepts and indicators for water assessment like other areas of research water assessment has required the development of its own vocabulary occasionally some of the terms are ambiguous water use is a general term that frequently leads to misunderstanding as it describes any action through which water provides a service however the term can be categorized in several ways because of its unspecificity one of the most common categorizations in the literature refers to consumptive and non consumptive uses of water 10 consumptive water use refers to the part of water withdrawn taken from a river basin subterranean deposit etc that is evaporated transpired incorporated into products consumed by humans or livestock or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment not to be returned at a later point in time by contrast non consumptive water alludes to the amount of water that despite being withdrawn from the body of water is later returned and available for recycling and or reuse in this sense water diversion which refers to the removal or transfer of water from one watershed to another typically falls into the category of consumptive water use several indicators with similar practical implications are defined for each of these two categories for consumptive use water footprint water consumption and water evaporation for non consumptive uses return flow and water discharges in this context the term water withdrawal sometimes referred as water abstraction determines the sum of both consumptive and non consumptive water uses fig 3 graphically outlines all these preliminary classifications table 2 describes the most commonly used terms by the literature when analysing water uses and their relevance the terms water requirement or water demand are more controversial some papers implicitly or explicitly use those terms meaning consumptive use others however implicitly or explicitly use those terms meaning the total amount of water required for making the human activity feasible both of consumptive and non consumptive nature thus the equivalent to withdrawals yet many papers make the identification of what they meant by water requirements or water demand impossible minimizing the amount of water consumed evaporated and or embedded in the production process is the objective of the ecological economics this school of thought tries to measure how much water is retained by a process or product never to be returned to the body of water from where it was removed the optimization problem faced by this approach is for the most part an unconstrained problem in general papers calculating the blue water footprint water evaporation water consumption are not concerned with the initial allocation of water or how much is the amount that needs to be removed from the source to make feasible the productive activity as long as it is later returned in this strand of the literature minimizing water demand or water use implies choosing the technology process which minimizes the evapotranspiration papers arising from the environmental economics tradition tend to face a different optimization problem what is the process that requires the least water to make it feasible given that water has a monetary cost that needs to be minimized an alternative formulation of the same optimization problem which may be stated in quantities of water rather than in monetary units is what is the maximum amount of output that can be obtained given an initial amount of water regardless of how much evaporates in the process environmental economists try to solve a constrained optimization problem that is maximising the number of activities human beings can conduct with a given water endowment in this sense the evaluation of alternative technologies processes are more related the technical and economic efficiency principles aiming at minimizing water demand or water use but here usually implying the amount of water withdrawn table 3 summarises the objectives theoretical assumptions indicators of interest and questions at stake from ecological and environmental economics in this context the opportunity cost emerges as a key issue this term widely used in economics refers to the cost of the alternative we renounce when we make a certain decision given limited resources in a context of climate change with increasing water scarcity minimizing the amount of water that is retained in a process or incorporated into a product may become less important than minimizing the amount of water that makes a process possible while in some cases these two objectives are simultaneously attainable in most instances there is a trade off between them which may not be obvious to policy makers and water users when they seek academic advice to minimise their water use 5 differences across the two major strains of literature wf vs lca the nuances of the different wf assessment methods may generate confusion for practitioners the water footprint assessment manual 1 presents a detailed methodology on how to assess the water footprint at the process product organization consumer group of consumers or geographic area scale while the life cycle analysis lca lca based iso 14046 standard provides the normative framework focusing on the process product and organization level 2 these approached define the water footprint concept differently 11 according to ref 1 the wf is an indicator of freshwater use that looks at both direct water use and indirect water use in the supply chain of a consumer or producer water use is measured in terms of water volumes consumed and or polluted and is detailed in space and time while the iso14046 2 defines the wf as a metric s that quantifies the potential environmental impacts related to water both frameworks follow a four phase approach to the wf assessment and provide the information both on water consumption and environmental impacts 1 setting goals and scope 2 accounting phase 3 impact assessment phase 4 interpretation and solutions 12 in the accounting phase the wf assessments according to the iso14046 2 should generally include the different forms of water use including evaporation transpiration product incorporation release into different drainage basins or the sea displacement of water from one water resource type to another within a drainage basin e g from groundwater to surface water and other forms of water use e g in stream use the wf assessment manual 1 makes a detailed analysis of water consumption complementary to the classical water withdrawal measure considering not only the blue water consumption but also the green water consumption 1 5 the iso14046 does not include this concept which is widely used in the field of water resources management in the lca studies the green water is generally included as an impact of land use as it is only reachable through land occupation and it is claimed not to contribute to blue water scarcity nor to be accessible for other productive uses 13 however green water resources are highly variable and can also be limited and scarce and can be substituted by or act as a substitute for blue water 14 affecting blue water availability 15 the concept of net green water has also been utilized by some companies as the difference between the water evaporated by crops and the water that would have evaporated from naturally occurring vegetation 16 17 large differences in estimated water footprints can occur with minor variations in the methodological approaches 18 with respect to the impact assessment phase the iso standard assesses the environmental impacts related to water leaving the economic and social impacts outside the scope of the standard herein lies the main gap between the two approaches the analytical tool proposed by ref 1 has been developed within the water resources research community as a volumetric measure of freshwater appropriation by contrast the iso 14046 lca based approach aims to account for environmental impacts 19 observe for irrigated wheat production that using the scarcity weighted wf or scarcity weighted water use alone for policymaking including product labelling punishes some farmers producing their wheat in a water sustainable way and promotes some farmers producing wheat unsustainably understanding the implications of both methodologies could take advantage of each other and practitioners could benefit from using these synergies in their studies 12 they should be cautious tough when comparing quantitative indicators from both methodologies finally in both approaches the evaluation of the wf of organizations can be approached from different perspectives depending on the objective and scope defined by the organization for instance an organization may include all products or only a group of products that the organization produces another may exclude raw materials focusing only on the production phase and another may exclude consumer use and end of life of the organization s products which hinders the comparability of the results from different studies the european commission is developing a harmonized environmental footprint methodology to be applied at the product product environmental footprint pef and organization level organization environmental footprints oef where water will be one of the 16 impact categories 20 table 4 summarises the most relevant aspects of each assessment method the connection between the present and the previous sections therefore emerges the methodology used in the water footprint assessment manual would answer the questions posed by ecological economists in contrast the life cycle analysis incorporated in the iso14046 standard and considering aspects such as water availability would be closer to answering the questions of environmental economists 6 significant inconsistencies inadequate quantification and misinterpretation in practice 6 1 tracking water in agriculture using either water withdrawal or water consumption approaches to measure water use and efficiency in relation to irrigation water conservation technologies and management practices used in the agricultural sector has an impact on the outcomes such as water conservation status and farmers revenue the decision to evaluate water efficiency in the agricultural sector based on withdrawals versus consumption here understood as evapotranspiration and embodied in plants could result in different incentives and water management decisions on the ground for instance generally surface irrigation requires more withdrawals to deliver water to crops per unit area but a significant portion of that water is returned to the system albeit often with degraded quality sprinkler irrigation requires less water withdrawals but can result in higher water consumption per unit area to grow an equivalent crop this happens particularly in hot and or windy areas where crop evapotranspiration i e beneficial evapotranspiration and non beneficial evapotranspiration i e non productive evapotranspiration mainly from non productive plants weeds or phreatophytes direct evaporation from water bodies wind drift and evaporation losses are higher in sprinkler irrigation mainly wind drift and evaporation loses 21 22 in the case of surface irrigation of corn alfalfa and winter cereal production in the ebro river in the north of spain the actual evapotranspiration is lower than the potential evapotranspiration exposing plants to water stress 22 this means that in certain cases increasing agricultural efficiency based on water withdrawals alone could increase water consumption and depletion likewise it is questioned whether the shift from traditional surface gravity irrigation to a more efficient drip irrigation reduces water consumption in arid and semi arid countries such as spain morocco or new mexico 23 25 drip irrigation tends to be associated with higher crop density a shift to more water intensive crops and the reuse of saved water to expand cultivated areas resulting in higher overall water consumption or rebound effect 25 surface irrigation is generally associated with higher water return flows which are losses from the economic point of view however a large part of these losses return to its source or to another surface or groundwater body becoming available for aquatic ecosystems and reuse 26 measures to reduce losses while maintaining existing levels of withdrawal would increase the productive efficiency of water use but may deprive downstream water users who depend on surface or groundwater bodies that are fed in part by the return flows 26 both water withdrawal and water consumption based indicators would encourage switch to rainfed agriculture where possible however just green and blue water consumption based indicators would promote better management of soil moisture such as conservation tillage or mulching and higher yields and productivity improvements in both irrigated and rainfed systems 27 28 in summary carrying out a fractional water accounting analysis which draws attention to the relevance of return flows and differences between water consumptive use beneficial and non beneficial and non consumptive use recoverable and non recoverable flows in space and time table 5 3 29 30 together with the green water footprint analysis 1 would provide a more complete picture fractional analysis draws attention to the inter connectedness of hydrological systems as increasing consumptive water use in one part of a catchment or basin can impact on water users and uses elsewhere in the basin 3 6 2 tracking water for energy energy represents the second thirstiest sector worldwide after agriculture water withdrawals for energy production are estimated at 583 billion cubic meters about 15 of the world s total withdrawals of which 66 billion cubic meters are consumed 31 since 90 of global power generation is water intensive water implications of different electricity generation technologies have been widely addressed in the literature 32 36 studies assessing the volumes of water needed for energy production make use of different water related metrics methods and terminology resulting in significant inconsistencies which hinder a proper quantification and lead to misinterpretations of the outcomes 37 the correct use of terms has significant implications on the estimation of water volumes of energy production for example 38 used recent research on water use in the us energy system as a case study and showed that minor changes in the definition of water consumption may change the consumptive water volumes estimated in previous works by 50 when considering only fresh water assuming that transfers are non consumptive and assuming that combustion water is a consumptive offset to 270 or 4000 when including green and grey water respectively without changes in the underlying data likewise water use terminology often differs among state agencies and occasionally water use terminology adopted by a same institution changes even over time resulting in differences in different measurements 1 1 the series of usgs water use circulars published from 1950 to 2015 represent a clear example of how water use terminology has evolved over time available online at https www usgs gov mission areas water resources science water use terminology qt science center objects 0 qt science center objects the lack of publicly complete consistent and updated official statistics is another barrier to proper water use accounting 39 even though in some regions the power sector is the largest water use activity national statistics on water use by individual power plants are characterized by inconsistencies and gaps in general the inconsistency incompleteness and age of individual estimates of water intensity may prevent a correct inventory of overall water use 40 and as well as the lack of sources of information containing data on cooling system configuration the most important characteristic governing the water use of a power plant together with the fuel type 41 42 43 also confirmed the existence of data gaps among international studies for factors driving water footprints e g resource quality power plant specifications and environmental conditions with most values coming from assumptions and other publications rather than direct measurements furthermore they found no evidence of increased reporting of these factors over time according to ref 44 the available data on thermoelectric water use in the u s are self reported by plant operators whose techniques for measuring water flows are not standardized for its part the united states geological survey usgs reports water withdrawals for thermoelectric power production every five years and consumptive water use has only been reported since 1995 another official agency such as the u s energy information administration eia provides energy statistics on an annual basis but omits data on nuclear installations and some natural gas combined cycle technologies 45 additionally all those thermoelectric power plants with generation capacities of less than 100 mw are not required to report water use to the eia furthermore in 2010 almost half of the installations that were required to report water consumption failed to do so or reported zero consumption 46 in spain one of the most arid countries in europe annual data on water uses at power plant level were only available from mid 2000 when spanish law made it compulsory for electricity companies to publish environmental reports certified by the eco management and audit scheme emas yet data on water uses provided by electricity companies are usually estimates and not direct measures from primary sources and in most cases these reports usually neither specify the accounting methodology used nor report data on both aspects of water use i e water withdrawal and water consumption 47 also noteworthy are the reviews focusing on water consumption but omitting withdrawals for many of the energy processes 32 48 50 finally the thoughtless use of old data sources may also result in echo chambers which alludes to amplification and repetition of information within closed network and leads to biases intensification of viewpoints and analyses based on incompatible data 51 therefore setting common standards by reporting consistent terminology and making sufficient and updated data available is crucial for the correct calculation of water uses for electricity generation and to translate into better political decision making in the water and energy sectors finally the use of common criteria methods for analysing water energy and food trade offs and addressing complex resource and development challenges remains limited 52 likewise the choice of the most appropriate indicators to measure the desired phenomenon according to the geographical location and thereby hydroclimatic conditions takes special relevance for water policymaking is the consumptive use of water always the most important aspect significant volumes of water must constantly pass through the systems of thermoelectric power plants to ensure their operation regardless of whether these are ultimately consumed in the cooling processes generally studies conducted from water abundant countries tend to pay attention to consumptive use of water however arid and semi arid countries lack sufficient water in the summer months of the year limiting the regular operation of such facilities both water withdrawal and consumption values are important indicators for water managers determining power plant impacts and vulnerabilities associated with water resources but the indicator of water withdrawal might prevail over that of water consumption when making policy decisions in water stressed countries 7 discussion most of the institutions and academics tracking water aim at providing better short and long term strategies to cope with vulnerability and resilience in future water stress scenarios indicators have been shown to have a significant influence on societies in general but also specifically in the case of policymaking 53 54 yet from the revision of concepts and indicators we have undertook in the forgone sections several ambiguities emerge that complicate the adoption of such strategies by those stakeholders for whom water is an essential asset when the concepts and indicators about water are far removed from the daily experience of those that must decide which technology technique to apply it is likely stakeholders ignore the academic recommendations a typical irrigator in an arid region would have serious difficulties understanding why the water footprint of sprinkler irrigation is greater than that of open furrow irrigation when the first technique allows him to irrigate a much larger area by extracting a quantity of water several orders of magnitude smaller than the second technique by the same token the manager of a thermal power plant in any arid country would prefer any cooling system that minimizes the overall water volumes required to pass through their system than a cooling system that minimizes the evaporation if that requires far more water to pass through the cooling system volumes that may not be available during the dry season in both these cases the stakeholders would ignore the technique technology that reduces water consumption defined as evapotranspiration embodied water in favor of techniques technologies that guarantee the output when the water indicators and recommendations have additional implications such as product labeling further caution is due and the use of complementary indicators advised including fractional analysis there is no one truth but a combination of good principles and both withdrawals and consumption are relevant the water footprint assessment is important but not enough withdrawals must also be accounted and reduced even if eventually a part of the water withdrawn returns to the water environment for the following reasons 1 to reduce non beneficial consumption and evaporation associated to inefficiency 2 to raise awareness of water use efficiency individual responsibility of users 3 to keep water in aquifers and rivers if not needed downstream users will have it available from the original source aquifer or river and avoid reuse 4 to manage pollution better the more water is used and discharged the more is degraded quality 5 energy use is connected with the raising share of groundwater irrigation globally the energy crisis goes together with freshwater crisis in heavy energy consuming regions the solution can be different from place to place depending not only the different temporal and spatial scales but also sectors and climatic conditions the type of water availability during the yearly water cycle and most efficient and beneficial use of it it is all about not using water if you do not need it understanding the socio economic and environmental limits through the year at the local and basin context is also crucial for understanding the incentives of the water stakeholders the appropriateness of a technology depends on the local situation and the resources available academic recommendations should avoid being normative what is appropriate in a water abundant scenario may not be so in an arid setting academics analysts and institutions tracking water for human uses must strive to contextualise the implications of their results and recommendations in order to establish mechanisms for ensuring policy coherence across the water accounting methods the data recollection and the precision of the definitions and calculations shall be enhanced water audits are a starting point to benchmark its status measure usage and identify areas for improvement in both the demand and supply sides a final note of caution the cross implications for the rest of environmental footprints one must bear in mind the fact that some of the issues this paper rises about the water footprint also apply to other footprints data availability definition calculations inconsistencies and usability for end users in particular but more importantly one should consider the existence of trade offs across the different footprints technologies techniques that improve the water footprint may for instance worsen the carbon footprint and vice versa we require far more encompassing and holistic approaches to guide and drive informed actions that help make meaningful change and ultimately benefit people and nature 8 recommendations the production of food and energy is accompanied by adverse water consequences academics have made considerable efforts to tackle these drawbacks in recent years today many of these advances still remain impractical on the ground among other things because the messages of academics to practitioners get lost in translation that occurs when the same wording is used to refer to rather different things but only academics are truly aware of the nuances implied by minimizing water use as it implies different things for different strands of the literature this study suggests that considering only water withdrawal or water consumption when talking about water use might not reflect actual impacts on the water environment one of the world s main water problems is scarcity reducing water scarcity requires a full understanding and accurate measurement of current and future water flows and uses at different scales 55 56 a first step would be accurate water accounting at a basin wide scale distinguishing between 1 beneficial evapotranspiration 2 non beneficial evapotranspiration 3 non recoverable runoff percolation and 4 recoverable runoff percolation 30 furthermore coupling this fractional water accounting frame together with the green water footprint analysis would provide incentives for promoting better management of soil moisture both in irrigated and rainfed systems getting higher yields and productivity improvements 27 28 we suggest that models should include somehow water availability for proper interpretations of the water energy food nexus and for managing the allocation of water as a scarce resource among alternative uses however measuring non recoverable and recoverable flows is sometimes challenging in practice it would be useful to test this comprehensive combination of indicators in pilot studies to show case their positive outcomes on the ground accurate accounting and measurement of water use can help identify opportunities for water savings increase water productivity and improve the rationale for water allocation among uses 56 however the theoretical and empirical research shows that the production and conservation goals are generally incompatible unless complementary water conservation policies are implemented 55 an appropriate accounting framework must be coupled with administrative action including an adequate register of water rights legal actions and fines involvement of water users in law enforcement and control capacity building of water users to help them comply with abstraction restrictions establishment of cross compliance requirements in agricultural subsidies and raising awareness about the consequences of over abstraction 56 57 finally certain aspects of institutional design also need to be reconsidered spanish royal decree 198 2015 of 23 march regulates the fee for the use of inland waters to produce electricity in inter community demarcations 2 2 the full text of royal decree 198 2015 of 23 march is available at https www boe es buscar act php id boe a 2015 3182 however according to this law only water concessionaires whose water is intended for the production of hydroelectric power shall be liable to pay the levy for the use of inland waters for the production of electricity the remaining power plants using significant amounts of water such as conventional thermal and nuclear power plants are not required to pay this fee if they do not pay for the water they use what incentive do stakeholders in the thermoelectric power sector have to make efficient use water in one of the most arid countries in europe the incentive system needs to be

the desirability of attaining environmental objectives by means of using market mechanisms like adjusting price signals in order to influence the behavior of households and firms there is however a significant overlap between environmental and ecological economics 7 in contrast the ecological economics views the human economy as a subset of the biosphere and focuses on the sustainable management and relationships of the economic and ecological systems accounting for both the financial constraints on consumption and for natural constraints implied by the wastes of production and consumption 7 9 these constraints which do not necessarily bind in the present but may reduce the capacity of the economic ecological system to provide for human wellbeing in the future are particularly relevant to sustainability and sustainable development humans are considered to be a major component of the overall economic ecological ecosystem rather than being the dominant and central components human society is thought of as co evolving with the natural world sustainable management of the economic and ecological system is one of the major focuses of ecological economics and the time frame of the analysis is typically longer than that considered in conventional economic analysis though overlapping in some areas environmental and ecological approaches have different purposes which require distinct assumptions and measures these two distinct approaches to the evaluation of human interaction with the natural world also differ in what is considered efficient table 1 summaries the different concepts of efficiency which also impact the efficiency and improvement policies in water used for benchmarking and evaluation we examine in the next section key to the evaluation of the efficiency in these different approaches is that while economic efficiency tends to be measured in monetary units eco efficiency is usually measured in quantities of resources only the pareto efficiency may be measured in quantities no alternative allocation of water at a given place and time would make at least one stakeholder better off without making someone else worse off 4 taxonomies concepts and indicators for water assessment like other areas of research water assessment has required the development of its own vocabulary occasionally some of the terms are ambiguous water use is a general term that frequently leads to misunderstanding as it describes any action through which water provides a service however the term can be categorized in several ways because of its unspecificity one of the most common categorizations in the literature refers to consumptive and non consumptive uses of water 10 consumptive water use refers to the part of water withdrawn taken from a river basin subterranean deposit etc that is evaporated transpired incorporated into products consumed by humans or livestock or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment not to be returned at a later point in time by contrast non consumptive water alludes to the amount of water that despite being withdrawn from the body of water is later returned and available for recycling and or reuse in this sense water diversion which refers to the removal or transfer of water from one watershed to another typically falls into the category of consumptive water use several indicators with similar practical implications are defined for each of these two categories for consumptive use water footprint water consumption and water evaporation for non consumptive uses return flow and water discharges in this context the term water withdrawal sometimes referred as water abstraction determines the sum of both consumptive and non consumptive water uses fig 3 graphically outlines all these preliminary classifications table 2 describes the most commonly used terms by the literature when analysing water uses and their relevance the terms water requirement or water demand are more controversial some papers implicitly or explicitly use those terms meaning consumptive use others however implicitly or explicitly use those terms meaning the total amount of water required for making the human activity feasible both of consumptive and non consumptive nature thus the equivalent to withdrawals yet many papers make the identification of what they meant by water requirements or water demand impossible minimizing the amount of water consumed evaporated and or embedded in the production process is the objective of the ecological economics this school of thought tries to measure how much water is retained by a process or product never to be returned to the body of water from where it was removed the optimization problem faced by this approach is for the most part an unconstrained problem in general papers calculating the blue water footprint water evaporation water consumption are not concerned with the initial allocation of water or how much is the amount that needs to be removed from the source to make feasible the productive activity as long as it is later returned in this strand of the literature minimizing water demand or water use implies choosing the technology process which minimizes the evapotranspiration papers arising from the environmental economics tradition tend to face a different optimization problem what is the process that requires the least water to make it feasible given that water has a monetary cost that needs to be minimized an alternative formulation of the same optimization problem which may be stated in quantities of water rather than in monetary units is what is the maximum amount of output that can be obtained given an initial amount of water regardless of how much evaporates in the process environmental economists try to solve a constrained optimization problem that is maximising the number of activities human beings can conduct with a given water endowment in this sense the evaluation of alternative technologies processes are more related the technical and economic efficiency principles aiming at minimizing water demand or water use but here usually implying the amount of water withdrawn table 3 summarises the objectives theoretical assumptions indicators of interest and questions at stake from ecological and environmental economics in this context the opportunity cost emerges as a key issue this term widely used in economics refers to the cost of the alternative we renounce when we make a certain decision given limited resources in a context of climate change with increasing water scarcity minimizing the amount of water that is retained in a process or incorporated into a product may become less important than minimizing the amount of water that makes a process possible while in some cases these two objectives are simultaneously attainable in most instances there is a trade off between them which may not be obvious to policy makers and water users when they seek academic advice to minimise their water use 5 differences across the two major strains of literature wf vs lca the nuances of the different wf assessment methods may generate confusion for practitioners the water footprint assessment manual 1 presents a detailed methodology on how to assess the water footprint at the process product organization consumer group of consumers or geographic area scale while the life cycle analysis lca lca based iso 14046 standard provides the normative framework focusing on the process product and organization level 2 these approached define the water footprint concept differently 11 according to ref 1 the wf is an indicator of freshwater use that looks at both direct water use and indirect water use in the supply chain of a consumer or producer water use is measured in terms of water volumes consumed and or polluted and is detailed in space and time while the iso14046 2 defines the wf as a metric s that quantifies the potential environmental impacts related to water both frameworks follow a four phase approach to the wf assessment and provide the information both on water consumption and environmental impacts 1 setting goals and scope 2 accounting phase 3 impact assessment phase 4 interpretation and solutions 12 in the accounting phase the wf assessments according to the iso14046 2 should generally include the different forms of water use including evaporation transpiration product incorporation release into different drainage basins or the sea displacement of water from one water resource type to another within a drainage basin e g from groundwater to surface water and other forms of water use e g in stream use the wf assessment manual 1 makes a detailed analysis of water consumption complementary to the classical water withdrawal measure considering not only the blue water consumption but also the green water consumption 1 5 the iso14046 does not include this concept which is widely used in the field of water resources management in the lca studies the green water is generally included as an impact of land use as it is only reachable through land occupation and it is claimed not to contribute to blue water scarcity nor to be accessible for other productive uses 13 however green water resources are highly variable and can also be limited and scarce and can be substituted by or act as a substitute for blue water 14 affecting blue water availability 15 the concept of net green water has also been utilized by some companies as the difference between the water evaporated by crops and the water that would have evaporated from naturally occurring vegetation 16 17 large differences in estimated water footprints can occur with minor variations in the methodological approaches 18 with respect to the impact assessment phase the iso standard assesses the environmental impacts related to water leaving the economic and social impacts outside the scope of the standard herein lies the main gap between the two approaches the analytical tool proposed by ref 1 has been developed within the water resources research community as a volumetric measure of freshwater appropriation by contrast the iso 14046 lca based approach aims to account for environmental impacts 19 observe for irrigated wheat production that using the scarcity weighted wf or scarcity weighted water use alone for policymaking including product labelling punishes some farmers producing their wheat in a water sustainable way and promotes some farmers producing wheat unsustainably understanding the implications of both methodologies could take advantage of each other and practitioners could benefit from using these synergies in their studies 12 they should be cautious tough when comparing quantitative indicators from both methodologies finally in both approaches the evaluation of the wf of organizations can be approached from different perspectives depending on the objective and scope defined by the organization for instance an organization may include all products or only a group of products that the organization produces another may exclude raw materials focusing only on the production phase and another may exclude consumer use and end of life of the organization s products which hinders the comparability of the results from different studies the european commission is developing a harmonized environmental footprint methodology to be applied at the product product environmental footprint pef and organization level organization environmental footprints oef where water will be one of the 16 impact categories 20 table 4 summarises the most relevant aspects of each assessment method the connection between the present and the previous sections therefore emerges the methodology used in the water footprint assessment manual would answer the questions posed by ecological economists in contrast the life cycle analysis incorporated in the iso14046 standard and considering aspects such as water availability would be closer to answering the questions of environmental economists 6 significant inconsistencies inadequate quantification and misinterpretation in practice 6 1 tracking water in agriculture using either water withdrawal or water consumption approaches to measure water use and efficiency in relation to irrigation water conservation technologies and management practices used in the agricultural sector has an impact on the outcomes such as water conservation status and farmers revenue the decision to evaluate water efficiency in the agricultural sector based on withdrawals versus consumption here understood as evapotranspiration and embodied in plants could result in different incentives and water management decisions on the ground for instance generally surface irrigation requires more withdrawals to deliver water to crops per unit area but a significant portion of that water is returned to the system albeit often with degraded quality sprinkler irrigation requires less water withdrawals but can result in higher water consumption per unit area to grow an equivalent crop this happens particularly in hot and or windy areas where crop evapotranspiration i e beneficial evapotranspiration and non beneficial evapotranspiration i e non productive evapotranspiration mainly from non productive plants weeds or phreatophytes direct evaporation from water bodies wind drift and evaporation losses are higher in sprinkler irrigation mainly wind drift and evaporation loses 21 22 in the case of surface irrigation of corn alfalfa and winter cereal production in the ebro river in the north of spain the actual evapotranspiration is lower than the potential evapotranspiration exposing plants to water stress 22 this means that in certain cases increasing agricultural efficiency based on water withdrawals alone could increase water consumption and depletion likewise it is questioned whether the shift from traditional surface gravity irrigation to a more efficient drip irrigation reduces water consumption in arid and semi arid countries such as spain morocco or new mexico 23 25 drip irrigation tends to be associated with higher crop density a shift to more water intensive crops and the reuse of saved water to expand cultivated areas resulting in higher overall water consumption or rebound effect 25 surface irrigation is generally associated with higher water return flows which are losses from the economic point of view however a large part of these losses return to its source or to another surface or groundwater body becoming available for aquatic ecosystems and reuse 26 measures to reduce losses while maintaining existing levels of withdrawal would increase the productive efficiency of water use but may deprive downstream water users who depend on surface or groundwater bodies that are fed in part by the return flows 26 both water withdrawal and water consumption based indicators would encourage switch to rainfed agriculture where possible however just green and blue water consumption based indicators would promote better management of soil moisture such as conservation tillage or mulching and higher yields and productivity improvements in both irrigated and rainfed systems 27 28 in summary carrying out a fractional water accounting analysis which draws attention to the relevance of return flows and differences between water consumptive use beneficial and non beneficial and non consumptive use recoverable and non recoverable flows in space and time table 5 3 29 30 together with the green water footprint analysis 1 would provide a more complete picture fractional analysis draws attention to the inter connectedness of hydrological systems as increasing consumptive water use in one part of a catchment or basin can impact on water users and uses elsewhere in the basin 3 6 2 tracking water for energy energy represents the second thirstiest sector worldwide after agriculture water withdrawals for energy production are estimated at 583 billion cubic meters about 15 of the world s total withdrawals of which 66 billion cubic meters are consumed 31 since 90 of global power generation is water intensive water implications of different electricity generation technologies have been widely addressed in the literature 32 36 studies assessing the volumes of water needed for energy production make use of different water related metrics methods and terminology resulting in significant inconsistencies which hinder a proper quantification and lead to misinterpretations of the outcomes 37 the correct use of terms has significant implications on the estimation of water volumes of energy production for example 38 used recent research on water use in the us energy system as a case study and showed that minor changes in the definition of water consumption may change the consumptive water volumes estimated in previous works by 50 when considering only fresh water assuming that transfers are non consumptive and assuming that combustion water is a consumptive offset to 270 or 4000 when including green and grey water respectively without changes in the underlying data likewise water use terminology often differs among state agencies and occasionally water use terminology adopted by a same institution changes even over time resulting in differences in different measurements 1 1 the series of usgs water use circulars published from 1950 to 2015 represent a clear example of how water use terminology has evolved over time available online at https www usgs gov mission areas water resources science water use terminology qt science center objects 0 qt science center objects the lack of publicly complete consistent and updated official statistics is another barrier to proper water use accounting 39 even though in some regions the power sector is the largest water use activity national statistics on water use by individual power plants are characterized by inconsistencies and gaps in general the inconsistency incompleteness and age of individual estimates of water intensity may prevent a correct inventory of overall water use 40 and as well as the lack of sources of information containing data on cooling system configuration the most important characteristic governing the water use of a power plant together with the fuel type 41 42 43 also confirmed the existence of data gaps among international studies for factors driving water footprints e g resource quality power plant specifications and environmental conditions with most values coming from assumptions and other publications rather than direct measurements furthermore they found no evidence of increased reporting of these factors over time according to ref 44 the available data on thermoelectric water use in the u s are self reported by plant operators whose techniques for measuring water flows are not standardized for its part the united states geological survey usgs reports water withdrawals for thermoelectric power production every five years and consumptive water use has only been reported since 1995 another official agency such as the u s energy information administration eia provides energy statistics on an annual basis but omits data on nuclear installations and some natural gas combined cycle technologies 45 additionally all those thermoelectric power plants with generation capacities of less than 100 mw are not required to report water use to the eia furthermore in 2010 almost half of the installations that were required to report water consumption failed to do so or reported zero consumption 46 in spain one of the most arid countries in europe annual data on water uses at power plant level were only available from mid 2000 when spanish law made it compulsory for electricity companies to publish environmental reports certified by the eco management and audit scheme emas yet data on water uses provided by electricity companies are usually estimates and not direct measures from primary sources and in most cases these reports usually neither specify the accounting methodology used nor report data on both aspects of water use i e water withdrawal and water consumption 47 also noteworthy are the reviews focusing on water consumption but omitting withdrawals for many of the energy processes 32 48 50 finally the thoughtless use of old data sources may also result in echo chambers which alludes to amplification and repetition of information within closed network and leads to biases intensification of viewpoints and analyses based on incompatible data 51 therefore setting common standards by reporting consistent terminology and making sufficient and updated data available is crucial for the correct calculation of water uses for electricity generation and to translate into better political decision making in the water and energy sectors finally the use of common criteria methods for analysing water energy and food trade offs and addressing complex resource and development challenges remains limited 52 likewise the choice of the most appropriate indicators to measure the desired phenomenon according to the geographical location and thereby hydroclimatic conditions takes special relevance for water policymaking is the consumptive use of water always the most important aspect significant volumes of water must constantly pass through the systems of thermoelectric power plants to ensure their operation regardless of whether these are ultimately consumed in the cooling processes generally studies conducted from water abundant countries tend to pay attention to consumptive use of water however arid and semi arid countries lack sufficient water in the summer months of the year limiting the regular operation of such facilities both water withdrawal and consumption values are important indicators for water managers determining power plant impacts and vulnerabilities associated with water resources but the indicator of water withdrawal might prevail over that of water consumption when making policy decisions in water stressed countries 7 discussion most of the institutions and academics tracking water aim at providing better short and long term strategies to cope with vulnerability and resilience in future water stress scenarios indicators have been shown to have a significant influence on societies in general but also specifically in the case of policymaking 53 54 yet from the revision of concepts and indicators we have undertook in the forgone sections several ambiguities emerge that complicate the adoption of such strategies by those stakeholders for whom water is an essential asset when the concepts and indicators about water are far removed from the daily experience of those that must decide which technology technique to apply it is likely stakeholders ignore the academic recommendations a typical irrigator in an arid region would have serious difficulties understanding why the water footprint of sprinkler irrigation is greater than that of open furrow irrigation when the first technique allows him to irrigate a much larger area by extracting a quantity of water several orders of magnitude smaller than the second technique by the same token the manager of a thermal power plant in any arid country would prefer any cooling system that minimizes the overall water volumes required to pass through their system than a cooling system that minimizes the evaporation if that requires far more water to pass through the cooling system volumes that may not be available during the dry season in both these cases the stakeholders would ignore the technique technology that reduces water consumption defined as evapotranspiration embodied water in favor of techniques technologies that guarantee the output when the water indicators and recommendations have additional implications such as product labeling further caution is due and the use of complementary indicators advised including fractional analysis there is no one truth but a combination of good principles and both withdrawals and consumption are relevant the water footprint assessment is important but not enough withdrawals must also be accounted and reduced even if eventually a part of the water withdrawn returns to the water environment for the following reasons 1 to reduce non beneficial consumption and evaporation associated to inefficiency 2 to raise awareness of water use efficiency individual responsibility of users 3 to keep water in aquifers and rivers if not needed downstream users will have it available from the original source aquifer or river and avoid reuse 4 to manage pollution better the more water is used and discharged the more is degraded quality 5 energy use is connected with the raising share of groundwater irrigation globally the energy crisis goes together with freshwater crisis in heavy energy consuming regions the solution can be different from place to place depending not only the different temporal and spatial scales but also sectors and climatic conditions the type of water availability during the yearly water cycle and most efficient and beneficial use of it it is all about not using water if you do not need it understanding the socio economic and environmental limits through the year at the local and basin context is also crucial for understanding the incentives of the water stakeholders the appropriateness of a technology depends on the local situation and the resources available academic recommendations should avoid being normative what is appropriate in a water abundant scenario may not be so in an arid setting academics analysts and institutions tracking water for human uses must strive to contextualise the implications of their results and recommendations in order to establish mechanisms for ensuring policy coherence across the water accounting methods the data recollection and the precision of the definitions and calculations shall be enhanced water audits are a starting point to benchmark its status measure usage and identify areas for improvement in both the demand and supply sides a final note of caution the cross implications for the rest of environmental footprints one must bear in mind the fact that some of the issues this paper rises about the water footprint also apply to other footprints data availability definition calculations inconsistencies and usability for end users in particular but more importantly one should consider the existence of trade offs across the different footprints technologies techniques that improve the water footprint may for instance worsen the carbon footprint and vice versa we require far more encompassing and holistic approaches to guide and drive informed actions that help make meaningful change and ultimately benefit people and nature 8 recommendations the production of food and energy is accompanied by adverse water consequences academics have made considerable efforts to tackle these drawbacks in recent years today many of these advances still remain impractical on the ground among other things because the messages of academics to practitioners get lost in translation that occurs when the same wording is used to refer to rather different things but only academics are truly aware of the nuances implied by minimizing water use as it implies different things for different strands of the literature this study suggests that considering only water withdrawal or water consumption when talking about water use might not reflect actual impacts on the water environment one of the world s main water problems is scarcity reducing water scarcity requires a full understanding and accurate measurement of current and future water flows and uses at different scales 55 56 a first step would be accurate water accounting at a basin wide scale distinguishing between 1 beneficial evapotranspiration 2 non beneficial evapotranspiration 3 non recoverable runoff percolation and 4 recoverable runoff percolation 30 furthermore coupling this fractional water accounting frame together with the green water footprint analysis would provide incentives for promoting better management of soil moisture both in irrigated and rainfed systems getting higher yields and productivity improvements 27 28 we suggest that models should include somehow water availability for proper interpretations of the water energy food nexus and for managing the allocation of water as a scarce resource among alternative uses however measuring non recoverable and recoverable flows is sometimes challenging in practice it would be useful to test this comprehensive combination of indicators in pilot studies to show case their positive outcomes on the ground accurate accounting and measurement of water use can help identify opportunities for water savings increase water productivity and improve the rationale for water allocation among uses 56 however the theoretical and empirical research shows that the production and conservation goals are generally incompatible unless complementary water conservation policies are implemented 55 an appropriate accounting framework must be coupled with administrative action including an adequate register of water rights legal actions and fines involvement of water users in law enforcement and control capacity building of water users to help them comply with abstraction restrictions establishment of cross compliance requirements in agricultural subsidies and raising awareness about the consequences of over abstraction 56 57 finally certain aspects of institutional design also need to be reconsidered spanish royal decree 198 2015 of 23 march regulates the fee for the use of inland waters to produce electricity in inter community demarcations 2 2 the full text of royal decree 198 2015 of 23 march is available at https www boe es buscar act php id boe a 2015 3182 however according to this law only water concessionaires whose water is intended for the production of hydroelectric power shall be liable to pay the levy for the use of inland waters for the production of electricity the remaining power plants using significant amounts of water such as conventional thermal and nuclear power plants are not required to pay this fee if they do not pay for the water they use what incentive do stakeholders in the thermoelectric power sector have to make efficient use water in one of the most arid countries in europe the incentive system needs to be

8671,we formalise a dynamic water pricing model as a tool for increasing social surplus in short term water allocations and long term water supply planning and investments we calculate in monetary terms the intertemporal risk that current water uses impose on future water availability termed as the risk adjusted user cost rauc given multi period droughts our model is calibrated to the water supply system in the australian capital territory results show that the rauc may be a substantial proportion of the cost of supplying water and incorporating it in the water price can result in long term welfare gains keywords climate change drought dynamic optimisation risk sustainability scarcity 1 introduction a key principle for water allocation to be efficient is that the water price paid by users be equal to the marginal economic cost of water supply which should include both explicit components e g pumping and treatment and implicit components e g opportunity cost and environmental values 1 fully incorporating all costs of water supply can provide overall welfare gains noting that in practice water prices seek to achieve multiple social and political objectives 2 water pricing can also be important in terms of demand management to regulate and promote household water use conservation especially in response to water scarcity 3 5 an important feature of water supply and distributions systems is that water supply demand is typically off phase 6 such that unrestricted water demand at a given price is greater than water supply during droughts to reduce the impact of the seasonality caused by this supply demand off phase water storages are typically built to store water during wet periods when supply is relatively abundant and demand is relatively lower these water storages are then available for dry periods when supply is relatively limited and demand is relatively higher thus water storage capacity and the uncertainty in weather together create an intertemporal connection between current and future water use increasing current water use reduces the amount of water potentially available for use in the future should a drought occur in other words current water consumption imposes a risk on future water users in terms of reduced water availability that is in part determined by future weather events e g relatively dry or wet this is an implicit cost component that should be included into the price charged to water users in addition to other costs of supplying water 7 8 but is not we refer to this implicit cost as the risk adjusted user cost rauc here our key contribution is to formalise a model to estimate the rauc in monetary terms calibrated to actual water supply and delivery systems our model features a dynamic optimisation framework where decision makers seek to maximise social welfare across a multiple year period in this framework the decision makers determine water prices considering the consumer welfare of current water users and the risks of future water scarcity we calibrate our model to the water supply and delivery system in the australia capital territory and compare the welfare under the current pricing system with a dynamic water price that includes the rauc our approach to estimating the rauc accounts for the possibility that water prices may not be economically efficient in practice in that they do not maximise social surplus water tariffs typically have multiple objectives 9 10 including supply cost recovery economic efficiency accessibility and affordability some of which may conflict 11 12 in part this explains why the design of urban water tariffs around the world are so diverse and contextual 13 with different designs based on multiple combinations of a fixed charge uniform volumetric charge variable block tariff seasonal and zonal pricing 14 these differences are partly explained by socio political objectives for example an increasing block tariff may be established to cross subsidise households with relatively small water use especially when the volumetric prices on the first consumption blocks are set lower than the average cost of water supply offsetting this lower price if there is full cost recovery of all supply costs could be a higher price for households with relatively larger water use on subsequent water consumption blocks that may exceed the average cost to ensure cost recovery 15 a key purpose of our price modelling is to show that further economic inefficiencies may arise if all costs are not fully accounted for in urban water pricing in practice we show that the rauc component could in some circumstances be a substantial proportion of the total cost of supplying water to users importantly our calibration shows that appropriately incorporating rauc could result in long term welfare gains to water users as far as we are aware this is the first model that explicitly calculates rauc in monetary terms for any jurisdiction in our approach we distinguish between two types of water use namely essential and discretionary non essential essential water includes the use of water for basic human needs e g cooking drinking and hygiene and which are typically not responsive to price changes the fact that the price of the essential water may not be set at the economically efficient level and its economic consequences are considered socio political constraints the discretionary water component includes the use of water for activities beyond basic needs e g swimming pool washing cars hosing gardens which are more volumetric price responsive our analysis focuses only on the discretionary water use in the presence of existing socio political constraints in section 2 we delineate our dynamic optimisation model for calculating the rauc section 3 provides background on the australian case study and also the model parameterisation results of our calibration are presented in section 4 section 5 discusses modelling insights and provides policy implications of the findings section 6 concludes 2 modelling rauc with dynamic water planning the first component of our model is a water inflow and outflow balance relationship rainfall from catchment areas flows into dams and we refer to this as gross inflow of the storage system the storage system has three non consumptive outflows namely 1 evaporation 2 leakage and 3 environmental releases if any in our model we refer to the difference between the gross inflow and the sum of the non consumptive outflows as the net inflow which and this is important to note varies with the weather the consumptive outflow i e the amount of extracted water for human consumption depends on population weather price and whether or not water restrictions are in place if the net inflow is smaller larger than the consumptive outflow the storage level will decline increase subject to maximum storage capacity we denote s t as the storage level at time t s as the maximum storage capacity i w t as the net inflow i e the gross inflow net non consumptive outflows and w t as weather the water balance can be formalised in equation 1 in this equation n t is the population measured in terms of the number of people or households which we refer to as water users or households interchangeably m is the essential use per water user q p t w t is the per capita water demand which depends on the volumetric water price p t and weather q s t is the water restriction quantity per water user if any which may depend on the water storage level in our model the water storage level that triggers restrictions on non essential water is exogenous this is because decisions on water restrictions are not only influenced by economic objectives but also socio political considerations e g to avoid the risk of not having enough water for essential purposes during droughts 1 s t 1 min s t i w t n t m min q s t q p t w t s water restrictions if imposed have an impact on consumer surplus we illustrate this impact in fig 1 where the downward sloping bcd line represents the demand for discretionary water the line aed represents the regulated water price and the line hgf represents the average cost of supplying discretionary water i e the average cost that has incorporated possible economic inefficiencies arising from socio political constraints without water restrictions water users consume the amount at point d and the consumer surplus is the area of the triangle abd the water utility may gain a positive net return from the difference between regulated price and the average cost of supplying discretionary water which is the area of adfh the total surplus is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus of the water utility which is equal to the area of bdfh when quantity restrictions are imposed e g at point j the total surplus shrinks to the area of bcgh the welfare impact illustrated in fig 1 can be applied in situations when the regulated price is equal to or lower than the average cost in practice a price regulatory authority may set the regulated price at the average cost to provide the water supplier with a break even revenue to cover all costs while ensuring non discriminatory access to monopoly water infrastructure in this case the profit of the water supplier is zero and the social surplus is equal to the consumer surplus in other cases an authority may set the regulated price below the average production cost to subsidise water users and receive a transfer from general government revenues in all cases the total surplus can be calculated by the area below the demand curve less the production cost that the society must incur to produce the extracted water quantity a representation of societal welfare is given by equation 2 where p q w t is the inverse of the per capita demand function q p w t and c t s t is the average cost of supplying discretionary water this cost includes explicit components e g pumping and water treatment implicit components e g environmental cost and foregone downstream economic benefit and possible add on components arising from socio political constraints the first term inside the largest brackets represents the consumer surplus plus the profit of the water supplier if any the second term represents the social cost of supplying water which includes the explicit and implicit cost components this societal welfare depends on the population weather and storage level so it can vary over time 2 s s p w t n t s t n t 0 min q s t q p w t p q w t d q c t s t min q s t q p w t the

case study background information and parameterisation in this section we show how to calibrate our model to an actual water supply system in australia the model is calibrated to the australian capital territory act but could be applied to any water pricing system where consumers are metered and charged volumetrically and there is adequate time series weather and water demand data to estimate the rauc 3 1 background information of the australian capital territory the act has an annual average rainfall of some 600 mm some of which is captured and then stored in a series of dams before 2013 the total capacity of the dam system was 211 billion litres gl during a major drought in the 2000s severe water restrictions were imposed to ensure sufficient water supply to meet expected demand the ending of the drought in 2010 coincided with a capacity extension of the dam system intended to reduce the likelihood of water restrictions in the future the current capacity storage capacity is 278 gl the left panel of fig 2 plots a time series of rainfall over ten years for the act from 2010 to 2019 with the horizontal black line representing the average rainfall 600 mm year rainfall in the act varies substantially from year to year and there is an imbalance between the number of years above and below average rainfall in particular rainfall was above the average in only three years black dots and below the average in the remaining seven years white dots this observation indicates the possibility of multiple year droughts where the rainfall is below the average for a number of years multi year droughts pose a greater risk of water scarcity than if the rainfall distribution were symmetric around the mean the middle and the right panels of fig 2 illustrate the off phase relationship between water supply and use the middle panel plots the relationship between rainfall and net inflow i e gross inflow net non consumptive outflows including evaporation leakages and releases if any the net inflow as we would expect is closely associated with rainfall and has a correlation ratio of 0 86 the right panel graphs consumptive water use outflow and rainfall that has a correlation ratio of 0 74 these two panels in fig 2 show that in relatively dry wet years when water inflow is relatively constrained available water consumption is relatively higher lower the water supply system of the act is managed by a single and government owned water supplier icon water water prices are regulated by the independent competition and regulator commission icrc to ensure non discriminatory access to monopoly and near monopoly infrastructure the overarching objective of the pricing regulation is to promote the efficient investment and operation and use of regulated services for long term interests of consumers in relation to the price quality safety reliability and security of services 17 p6 the icrc sets water prices to ensure icon water s revenues equal the sum of all recognised cost components break even pricing these costs include the operating expenditures cost of capital depreciation tax and pass through of unexpected or government mandated costs estimated over 5 year planning horizons and is cpi indexed 17 p3 18 p3 the regulated water price also includes a water abstraction charge wac which comprises the private opportunity cost of water and a public opportunity cost associated with a reduction in ecosystem services because of reduced downstream flows because of water consumption in the act 19 the current water pricing system does not include the rauc icon water has a high fixed cost of water supply and distribution and a relatively low marginal cost which ranges from 0 72 aud kl to 1 74 aud kl 20 economic theory indicates that efficient water pricing requires with full cost recovery that a water tariff which includes a fixed charge equal to the fixed cost be divided by the number of water users plus a volumetric charge equal to the marginal cost of water supply and distribution such a pricing scheme in the act require water users to pay a relatively large fixed charge to connect to the water supply system and in the absence of transfers be unaffordable for some poorer households thus to balance the cost recovery economic efficiency and affordability objectives the act combines a fixed water charge and an increasing block tariff based on water volumes used by households to meet an affordability objective the fixed charge only covers a proportion of the fixed costs and the remaining costs of supplying water are therefore recovered by ensuring the volumetric price is above the marginal cost of supply in particular the increasing block tariffs include two tiers 21 t8 1 a lower tier 1 price 2 43 aud kl in 2018 19 applied to the first 50 kl of water use per household each quarter and a higher tier 2 price 4 88 aud kl applied to the water quantity above the 50 kl per water user if any the tier 1 and tier 2 water prices apply to all users but the fixed charge may vary across resident and non resident premises 21 t9 4 in general when water prices vary across water users price heterogeneity must be accounted for when evaluating total consumer surplus when calibrating our model for the act we specified the essential water quantity to be the actual quantity at tier 1 not the maximum threshold which was 25 43 gl in 2018 19 21 or on average 140 kl per household year equivalent to around 171 litres person day this essential water use level is comparable to the average residential end use water in some developed countries i e from around 100 litres person day in the netherlands to around 250 litres person day in the usa 22 in terms of the essential water use the tier 1 water quantity in the act is higher than the subsistence level suggested by who ranging from 50 litres person day for drinking cooking personal hygiene washing home cleaning to 70 litre person day to include growing food for family use and sanitation waste disposal 23 we consider tier 2 water use to be discretionary water use and observe that the current act pricing scheme cross subsidises tier 1 water uses while paying a volumetric price slightly higher than the marginal cost tier 1 water uses pay only a proportion of their share of the fixed costs thus tier 1 consumers pay less than the average cost of the whole water supply system in turn this raises the cost of supplying water to tier 2 users above the marginal cost of water supply thus full cost recovery and affordability objectives affect the cost imposed on tier 2 water uses we include these social political objectives in our dynamic optimisation and specify the average cost of supplying discretionary water at the break even price of tier 2 water use i e 4 88 aud kl 2019 value 3 2 net inflow weather classification and water use using the data in the middle panel of fig 2 we estimated the distribution of the net inflow by fitting a generalised gamma distribution i e with the shape and the scale parameters these two parameters are estimated by the bias corrected mixed type log moment estimators of gamma distributions 24 25 to control for the small sample the statistical efficiency of this estimate can improve if more data become available in future combining the fitted gamma distribution and previous studies on the murray darling basin mdb a large catchment area that contains the act 26 27 we classify dry normal and wet weather realisations using the 25 and 75 percentile points i e a dry year has net inflow less than 25 percentile a normal year has net inflow between 25 and 75 percentile points and a wet has net inflow above 75 percentile point mathematically w d r y n o r m a l w e t where w d r y indicates a dry year when water inflow into dams is below 25 percentile point w n o r m a l indicates a normal year when water inflow is between 25 and 75 percentile points and w w e t indicates a wet year when water inflow is more than 75 percentile point in the baseline scenario we calibrate the model when there is no serial correlation in weather i e the probability of dry normal and wet weather next year is 0 25 0 5 and 0 25 respectively regardless of the current weather however when weather serial correlation is taken into account the distribution of next year s weather depends on whether the current weather is dry normal or wet this conditional probability distribution is estimated using annual inflow data since 1890 in mdb 26 i e the fractions of year t being dry normal and wet given year t 1 was a dry normal and wet year respectively as this long time series data is not available for the act we used the data in the right panel of fig 2 to approximate the average water use in dry normal and wet weather the three corresponding levels of average annual use in the act without quantity restrictions are 305 kl 288 kl 282 kl per water user subtracting the tier 1 water from the total use the annual tier 2 use per water user results in approximate water use of 165 kl 148 kl and 142 kl for dry normal and wet weather respectively in other words the tier 2 water quantities in normal and wet weather are some 90 and 86 of that in a dry weather period 3 3 calibrating the demand function for discretionary water microeconomic analysis often uses two common functional forms to calibrate demand functions namely constant price elasticity and constant slope linear functions corresponding to the log log and level level specifications 28 chapter 7 in this specific case study the mathematical property of the constant elasticity would mean that a substantial number of water users would still buy non essential water from the supplier in the act if the price were set at a very high level say 100 kl especially when the demand is inelastic we are not aware of any previous studies which provide a reliable estimate of the price elasticity of non essential water in act if we were to adopt the estimated elasticity for outdoor water use in the nearby city of sydney i e 0 59 29 we find that the constant elasticity demand function would mean that if the water supplier in act set the price of their water at 100 kl they would still be able to sell approximately 4 97 gl non essential water in 2019 this does not seem plausible given that act residents have a backstop option to purchase water from a near by catchment region and transport water to the act at a much lower cost but still higher than the current price 4 88 m3 for this reason we use the constant slope function to calibrate the demand function using the backstop price the demand function for discretionary water is represented in equation 5 where a w is the slope of the demand function the slope of the demand function can be estimated using an observed price and quantity p 0 and q p 0 w as in equation 6 the only additional parameter required is the backstop price which is the cost of water from a stable alternative source the nearest stable alternative and large supply source for the act is the snowy scheme in cooma approximately 100 km to the south this water source has relatively stable inflow from the near by snowy mountain and multiple storage capacity we assume that if water is not available in the act and if water users can afford the transportation cost plus the price of water in cooma they would be able to purchase water from the snowy scheme consequently the backstop price which includes the transportation cost plus the price of water in cooma is assumed to be 25 aud kl in the baseline scenario we varied this backstop price between 20 and 30aud kl in our sensitivity analysis 5 q p w a w p b a c k s t o p p 6 a w q p o w p b a c k s t o p p o 3 4 water restrictions how much and when water restrictions in the act occur in four progressively more constraining stages 30 these stages restrict part or all water use in 11 categories of activities including lawn hosing pave cleaning swimming pool car washing and construction related activities the four stages are expected to limit water use to 90 75 65 and 45 of the unrestricted use to date only the first three water restriction stages have ever been applied in practice in particular a stage 1 restriction was applied once in december 2002 when the storage level was 117 gl and it was quickly followed by a stage 2 restriction in april 2003 the most recent stage 2 restrictions were in november 2005 and november 2006 when the storage dropped to 104 gl and 97 gl respectively the most recent stage 3 restriction was in september 2004 but there is no published data on the storage level at that time given the historical data we specify that when the storage drops to 117 gl i e 42 of the storage capacity a stage 1 water restriction would be applied which restricts water use at 90 of the unrestricted use level if the storage level further drops to 100 gl i e 36 of the storage capacity water use would be restricted to 75 of the unrestricted level 3 5 parameterisation and solution technique table 1 summarises the parameter values for calculating the rauc in addition to those parameters presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 we specify the discount rate ρ 2 5 equal to the average 10 year australian government bond interest rate during the 2010 2019 period the planning horizon is specified at 30 years which is the expected lifespan of the current water supply system 31 p32 the number of billed water users in the base year 2019 is 178 975 and it is expected to grow by 1 4 per year 21 all parameters together with relevant sources are reported in table 1 we used the parameters in table 1 to solve the dynamic optimisation in equation 3 using bellman s principle of optimality 32 the dynamic optimisation problem does not have a closed form solution thus we used numerical approximation and the value function iteration technique to find a solution with this numerical technique the rauc is calculated at every 5 percentage point of the storage level above the restriction triggering thresholds e g 45 50 of the storage capacity and so on the values of rauc between these points are approximated using piece wise linear functions at water storage levels below the restriction triggering thresholds water restrictions are applied and the rauc is no longer relevant this is because rauc is the risk caused by current water users who consume water from current water storages noting that if consumer water restrictions are imposed marginal water consumption is regulated by an administrative measure rather than by the volumetric price in this situation increases or decreases in water price may have a distributional impact on water users and the water supplier but they will not change social welfare as measured by equation 2 4 result of the case study 4 1 baseline scenario we solved the dynamic optimisation in equation 3 and calculated the rauc specified in equation 4 the rauc varies with storage levels weather and population i e the number of water users the specific results for the base year 2019 are summarised in fig 3 our results show substantial values of the rauc ranging from around 1 1aud kl to around 4 7aud kl or equivalently from 23 to 96 of the regulated water price for discretionary water use i e 4 88aud kl in 2019 value in other words should the regulatory authority account for the risk of current water use on future water scarcity the volumetric water price of discretionary water could be substantially greater than the current regulated volumetric water price depending on the weather realisation and storage our results in fig 3 shows that the rauc in dry weather is higher than in normal and wet weather over a range of storage levels while the rauc exists with all types of weather the risk during normal and wet weather is lower because inflows are smaller during dry weather the rauc is the same in normal and wet weather in this specific case but this is not a universal result the difference across the three weather types are relatively small due to the existence of the restriction and the large storage capacity compared to annual consumption making water availability in the act more vulnerable to multiple year droughts rather and the weather variation in a particular year fig 3 illustrates an important property of the rauc previously identified by ref 7 namely the rauc increases as water storage level declines this is because an additional amount of water reduces the storage level and increase the risk of water restrictions and welfare loss this risk is greater when the current storage is close to the threshold level or when water use restrictions would be applied this property implies that the optimal volumetric water price would be lower when dams are full and would increase as the storage level declines an important result illustrated in fig 3 is that rauc may remain positive even when the storage is full this is because rauc measures the impact of reducing storage level on the risk of water restrictions in future the rauc is greater than zero if current water use were to reduce the storage level e g from 100 to 99 and if this storage reduction were to increase the risk of future water restrictions if current water use were not to reduce the full storage level e g water users were only to consume water spilling over from water storages then the rauc would be zero because there would be no impact on the risk of future water restrictions to highlight the welfare impact of incorporating rauc we compare two scenarios dynamic pricing with the rauc and business as usual bau pricing bau is the current water tariff that sets the price of water to deliver a financial break even point for icon water the welfare impact is summarised in fig 4 where the vertical axis measures the annualised surplus generated by discretionary water in monetary terms the figure shows that the total surplus associated with each pricing scheme varies with water storage levels and that dynamic water pricing generates gains over the bau approach the gap between the two levels of total surplus in fig 4 represents the gain which amounts to around 8 million aud a year 2019 value or approximately 1 5 of the surplus generated by the bau pricing approach the gain of the rauc approach arises because the risk of water restrictions declines although non essential water users also pay a higher price depending on the storage level and weather realisations as the rauc is an implicit cost of using water resources the revenue from collecting rauc would be transferred to the government rather than retained by icon water fig 5 summarises the dynamics of rauc over the 2020 2026 period as formalised in equation 4 the number of water users i e population is a determinant of the rauc thus the rauc will vary over time as the population grows this is because as the number of water users increases this places a greater demand on the water supply system all else equal and thus increases the risks of welfare reducing water restrictions 20 f4 6 f4 8 4 2 the impact of the storage level threshold for water restrictions our model assumes that decisions on restrictions of non essential water uses are not only influenced by economic objectives but also socio political considerations in other words setting a storage level threshold for water restrictions sacrifices some economic efficiency for socio political objectives if the objective were to optimise for economic efficiency there would not be any restrictions on water use here we undertake a sensitivity analysis in terms of the water storage level threshold as to when water restrictions are introduced as a proportion of the overall capacity of water stotrages in the sensitivity analysis we consider two additional scenarios should the water storage level threshold be reduced from 42 to 30 and to 10 respectively these scenarios are sufficient to capture the unlikely possibility that the act water authority were to become less risk averse in how it regulates the water supply the results of the sensitivity analysis is summarised in table 2 with the mean of the rauc at various storage levels and with different thresholds as a percentage of water storages capacity when water restrictions are implemented the results show that should the water storage threshold be reduced as to when water use restrictions are imposed non essential water users would have lower risks of water restrictions thus a lower threshold as to when water restrictions are imposed is associated with a lower rauc if all other factors remain unchanged 4 3 the impact of the backstop price the backstop price is the cost of supplying water from an alternative stable source if the backstop price were lower act residents could purchase water from a nearby catchment at a lower cost if they are restricted from using act supplied water for this reason water users would be less averse to the risk of water restrictions in future hence the rauc would be reduced if the backstop price were higher act residents would be more averse to the risk of water restrictions and the rauc would be higher we undertook a sensitivity analysis to examine how the rauc might respond to the backstop price three backstop prices were considered namely 20 25 and 30 aud kl the results are summarised in fig 6 the figure shows that the rauc increases with the level of risk aversion with a higher cost associated with purchasing water from alternative water sources back stop price water users would be more risk averse and as a result the rauc would be substantially higher 4 4 climate impacts climate change in south eastern australia is expected to increase the risk of water scarcity to urban communities 33 p13 15 these risks include two key factors first climate change may increase weather variability such that rainfall becomes scarcer in dry years and more abundant in wet years second climate change may also increase the inter annual correlation in the weather which can cause extended droughts table 3 summarises the estimated impact of climate change on rainfall in the murray darling basin a broad geographic region that contains the act the table shows the changes in expected rainfall in 2030 compared to the 1986 2005 period over four climate change scenarios where rcpx y is a representative concentration pathway global warming scenario that leads to an average of x y watts per square meter across the planet 34 the table shows that projected annual rainfall variability in the act does not vary substantially across the four scenarios but projection outcomes do predict that there would be less rain in dry years and more rain in wet years a possible impact of climate change on the risk of water scarcity is the inter annual correlation in the weather the inter annual correlation means that a dry year is more likely followed by another dry year in other words not only might there be less rain in a single dry year but there is a higher risk of consecutive dry years to quantify the impact of this inter annual correlation we adopted a weather distribution estimated for the mdb 26 as reported in table 4 this table shows that the distribution of future weather varies with current weather in contrast to the baseline scenario estimated in section 3 2 that assumes the distribution is always 0 25 0 5 0 25 the weather distribution in table 4 is more likely to result in multiple year droughts because the probability of a dry year being followed by another dry year is 35 7 while it is 25 in the baseline distribution combining the four scenarios of annual rainfall variability table 3 with the baseline weather distribution and the distribution in table 4 generates eight climate scenarios we repeatedly calculated the rauc for each climate scenario and summarised the results in table 5 the table reports for brevity and easy comparison the rauc in the year 2019 and as a benchmark for comparison across states of the world and specifies the water storage at 60 for all scenarios the results in table 5 show that the annual rainfall variability has little impact on rauc while the impact of inter annual correlation is much more important this is not a general result and would depend on the pattern of rainfall variability and where water storages are located as previously noted the act currently has a relatively large storage capacity compared to annual use e g 278 gl water storage capacity compared to 56 gl water use in the drought year of 2019 thus even when the storage is not completely full the act may have sufficient water for two or possibly three years in the worst water inflow scenario before the storage level drops to the threshold that triggers water restrictions this large water storage capacity means that in a dry year where rainfall inflow can normally fill only around 5 7 of the storage capacity some modest variability in this limited inflow would have less impact than the possibility of another dry year ahead in other words the water supply in the act can withstand annual rainfall variability better than multiple year droughts and which are predicted to increase in frequency with climate change 35 past multiple year droughts were not uncommon in the act examples include three consecutive dry years from 2001 to 2003 that triggered a series of water restrictions during the 2000s and contributed to the historic bushfire in 2003 that caused about half of the water supply system to be unavailable for household use because of inadequate water quality another period of drought was from 2017 to 2019 that resulted in the act s water storage levels declining from almost full capacity in november 2016 to below 46 capacity in january 2020 this decline in water supply led the act government to consider re applying strict water restrictions should water storage levels further decline if the water extraction could be reduced the water supply system would be able to withstand a longer drought before the storage reached an undesirable threshold as a proportion of water storage capacity 5 discussion our model is calibrated to a specific catchment area the act in australia but our results also provide general implications and insights about how to apply the rauc in other locations first there is a significant intertemporal risk caused by current water use on future water availability failing to consider this risk in water pricing decisions may result in misallocations of scarce water supplies if decision makers consider social welfare over multiple years dynamic water pricing can be used to regulate short term water demand and to improve long run planning of water resources management 36 in some cases the rauc could be a significant proportion of existing volumetric water prices second the rauc may also exist in normal and wet weather and this differs in practice to peak load pricing 37 38 while peak load pricing is usually applied to regulate demand in dry weather the rauc accounts for weather uncertainty in the future thus extracting water for use in normal and wet weather can also impose a risk on future water uses this finding is explained by the intertemporal nature of the risk i e the impact of current use on future water availability as future weather is unknown there is a certain probability of droughts such that reducing water storage levels at a given point in time may reduce the water storage system s ability to withstand future droughts especially droughts that may last several years third the rauc is an implicit economic cost and including it in the price of water assists to allocate water resources across time in a more economically efficient way unlike explicit costs such as pumping or treatment the rauc is not incurred by the water supplier for this reason the revenue from collecting rauc could be transferred to the government similar to the opportunity cost of not having water downstream or the forgone environmental benefits of having water flow which have already been included in the act s wac higher pricing revenue with a rauc could be used to support water conservation technology and possibly delay the need for costly infrastructure extension 5 39 the rauc as a component of dynamic water pricing might also provide a means to support financial stability and smooth operations of water suppliers which are both regulated by pricing decisions and subject to uncertainty in water demand 40 further establishing the rauc as part of a volumetric water price does not necessarily conflict with social considerations because the additional pricing revenue from the rauc could also be used to support low income or disadvantaged water users 10 41 fourth the rauc in a particular location may be reduced by expanding storage capacity theoretically a large storage capacity relative to annual consumption can help store water in wetter periods for drier periods thus reducing the intertemporal risk caused by water extraction nevertheless the opportunity to build larger water storage is not always a feasible option in practice because of the lack of adequate available land while additional water storage may still not be sufficient during prolonged droughts in our calibration for the act we find that the rauc may be relatively large despite recent augmentation in the water storage capacity to about five times of annual consumption fifth a necessary condition in applying rauc in practice is that water users are individually metered in terms of their volumetric water use whenever there is universal or close to household metering dynamic water pricing that includes the rauc should prove no more difficult to implement than other methods of water pricing while water prices may not be instantly updated to have an immediate impact on water consumption incorporating the rauc in the water price can send a signal of possible water scarcity in the future and thus help water supply providers and also water users better prepare for potentially prolonged droughts such preparatory pricing whereby prices vary depending on water storages but not a rauc is feasible and was introduced in 2020 in sydney australia s largest city finally while the rauc may be included in part of water tariffs to improve intertemporal allocative efficiency it is not a hedging tool against water scarcity in other words incorporating the rauc does not mean water availability is secured into the future for this reason it is important to avoid misunderstanding of the rauc as insurance against weather uncertainty that might affect the water conservation measures of communities 42 6 conclusions we formalise and simulate a risk adjusted user cost rauc into the volumetric water price charged to water consumers in an urban context we show that a rauc can increase inter temporal social surplus by providing a price signal to water consumers to adjust their current water uses by pricing the risk of their current water use on reducing future water availability our study was calibrated to the supply and distribution system in the australia capital territory we found that in this water supply system the water supply risk is substantial and this risk can be incorporated into the volumetric price of discretionary water uses we also observed that incorporating the rauc into the volumetric water price of water users would increase the inter temporal social surplus from water use relative to business as usual while our model is calibrated to the australian capital territory it can be applied to other locations around the world where there are adequate time series data on weather and water uses and water uses are metered given that extracting water from dams today will not increase water availability in the future the rauc provides an implicit link between current water use and future water availability in our view dynamic pricing that includes the rauc is especially valuable where there is a risk of reduced future water availability from weather related events such as in semi arid regions in locations where climate change is projected to increase weather variability and also in places where water demand is rapidly increasing author

8671,we formalise a dynamic water pricing model as a tool for increasing social surplus in short term water allocations and long term water supply planning and investments we calculate in monetary terms the intertemporal risk that current water uses impose on future water availability termed as the risk adjusted user cost rauc given multi period droughts our model is calibrated to the water supply system in the australian capital territory results show that the rauc may be a substantial proportion of the cost of supplying water and incorporating it in the water price can result in long term welfare gains keywords climate change drought dynamic optimisation risk sustainability scarcity 1 introduction a key principle for water allocation to be efficient is that the water price paid by users be equal to the marginal economic cost of water supply which should include both explicit components e g pumping and treatment and implicit components e g opportunity cost and environmental values 1 fully incorporating all costs of water supply can provide overall welfare gains noting that in practice water prices seek to achieve multiple social and political objectives 2 water pricing can also be important in terms of demand management to regulate and promote household water use conservation especially in response to water scarcity 3 5 an important feature of water supply and distributions systems is that water supply demand is typically off phase 6 such that unrestricted water demand at a given price is greater than water supply during droughts to reduce the impact of the seasonality caused by this supply demand off phase water storages are typically built to store water during wet periods when supply is relatively abundant and demand is relatively lower these water storages are then available for dry periods when supply is relatively limited and demand is relatively higher thus water storage capacity and the uncertainty in weather together create an intertemporal connection between current and future water use increasing current water use reduces the amount of water potentially available for use in the future should a drought occur in other words current water consumption imposes a risk on future water users in terms of reduced water availability that is in part determined by future weather events e g relatively dry or wet this is an implicit cost component that should be included into the price charged to water users in addition to other costs of supplying water 7 8 but is not we refer to this implicit cost as the risk adjusted user cost rauc here our key contribution is to formalise a model to estimate the rauc in monetary terms calibrated to actual water supply and delivery systems our model features a dynamic optimisation framework where decision makers seek to maximise social welfare across a multiple year period in this framework the decision makers determine water prices considering the consumer welfare of current water users and the risks of future water scarcity we calibrate our model to the water supply and delivery system in the australia capital territory and compare the welfare under the current pricing system with a dynamic water price that includes the rauc our approach to estimating the rauc accounts for the possibility that water prices may not be economically efficient in practice in that they do not maximise social surplus water tariffs typically have multiple objectives 9 10 including supply cost recovery economic efficiency accessibility and affordability some of which may conflict 11 12 in part this explains why the design of urban water tariffs around the world are so diverse and contextual 13 with different designs based on multiple combinations of a fixed charge uniform volumetric charge variable block tariff seasonal and zonal pricing 14 these differences are partly explained by socio political objectives for example an increasing block tariff may be established to cross subsidise households with relatively small water use especially when the volumetric prices on the first consumption blocks are set lower than the average cost of water supply offsetting this lower price if there is full cost recovery of all supply costs could be a higher price for households with relatively larger water use on subsequent water consumption blocks that may exceed the average cost to ensure cost recovery 15 a key purpose of our price modelling is to show that further economic inefficiencies may arise if all costs are not fully accounted for in urban water pricing in practice we show that the rauc component could in some circumstances be a substantial proportion of the total cost of supplying water to users importantly our calibration shows that appropriately incorporating rauc could result in long term welfare gains to water users as far as we are aware this is the first model that explicitly calculates rauc in monetary terms for any jurisdiction in our approach we distinguish between two types of water use namely essential and discretionary non essential essential water includes the use of water for basic human needs e g cooking drinking and hygiene and which are typically not responsive to price changes the fact that the price of the essential water may not be set at the economically efficient level and its economic consequences are considered socio political constraints the discretionary water component includes the use of water for activities beyond basic needs e g swimming pool washing cars hosing gardens which are more volumetric price responsive our analysis focuses only on the discretionary water use in the presence of existing socio political constraints in section 2 we delineate our dynamic optimisation model for calculating the rauc section 3 provides background on the australian case study and also the model parameterisation results of our calibration are presented in section 4 section 5 discusses modelling insights and provides policy implications of the findings section 6 concludes 2 modelling rauc with dynamic water planning the first component of our model is a water inflow and outflow balance relationship rainfall from catchment areas flows into dams and we refer to this as gross inflow of the storage system the storage system has three non consumptive outflows namely 1 evaporation 2 leakage and 3 environmental releases if any in our model we refer to the difference between the gross inflow and the sum of the non consumptive outflows as the net inflow which and this is important to note varies with the weather the consumptive outflow i e the amount of extracted water for human consumption depends on population weather price and whether or not water restrictions are in place if the net inflow is smaller larger than the consumptive outflow the storage level will decline increase subject to maximum storage capacity we denote s t as the storage level at time t s as the maximum storage capacity i w t as the net inflow i e the gross inflow net non consumptive outflows and w t as weather the water balance can be formalised in equation 1 in this equation n t is the population measured in terms of the number of people or households which we refer to as water users or households interchangeably m is the essential use per water user q p t w t is the per capita water demand which depends on the volumetric water price p t and weather q s t is the water restriction quantity per water user if any which may depend on the water storage level in our model the water storage level that triggers restrictions on non essential water is exogenous this is because decisions on water restrictions are not only influenced by economic objectives but also socio political considerations e g to avoid the risk of not having enough water for essential purposes during droughts 1 s t 1 min s t i w t n t m min q s t q p t w t s water restrictions if imposed have an impact on consumer surplus we illustrate this impact in fig 1 where the downward sloping bcd line represents the demand for discretionary water the line aed represents the regulated water price and the line hgf represents the average cost of supplying discretionary water i e the average cost that has incorporated possible economic inefficiencies arising from socio political constraints without water restrictions water users consume the amount at point d and the consumer surplus is the area of the triangle abd the water utility may gain a positive net return from the difference between regulated price and the average cost of supplying discretionary water which is the area of adfh the total surplus is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus of the water utility which is equal to the area of bdfh when quantity restrictions are imposed e g at point j the total surplus shrinks to the area of bcgh the welfare impact illustrated in fig 1 can be applied in situations when the regulated price is equal to or lower than the average cost in practice a price regulatory authority may set the regulated price at the average cost to provide the water supplier with a break even revenue to cover all costs while ensuring non discriminatory access to monopoly water infrastructure in this case the profit of the water supplier is zero and the social surplus is equal to the consumer surplus in other cases an authority may set the regulated price below the average production cost to subsidise water users and receive a transfer from general government revenues in all cases the total surplus can be calculated by the area below the demand curve less the production cost that the society must incur to produce the extracted water quantity a representation of societal welfare is given by equation 2 where p q w t is the inverse of the per capita demand function q p w t and c t s t is the average cost of supplying discretionary water this cost includes explicit components e g pumping and water treatment implicit components e g environmental cost and foregone downstream economic benefit and possible add on components arising from socio political constraints the first term inside the largest

case study background information and parameterisation in this section we show how to calibrate our model to an actual water supply system in australia the model is calibrated to the australian capital territory act but could be applied to any water pricing system where consumers are metered and charged volumetrically and there is adequate time series weather and water demand data to estimate the rauc 3 1 background information of the australian capital territory the act has an annual average rainfall of some 600 mm some of which is captured and then stored in a series of dams before 2013 the total capacity of the dam system was 211 billion litres gl during a major drought in the 2000s severe water restrictions were imposed to ensure sufficient water supply to meet expected demand the ending of the drought in 2010 coincided with a capacity extension of the dam system intended to reduce the likelihood of water restrictions in the future the current capacity storage capacity is 278 gl the left panel of fig 2 plots a time series of rainfall over ten years for the act from 2010 to 2019 with the horizontal black line representing the average rainfall 600 mm year rainfall in the act varies substantially from year to year and there is an imbalance between the number of years above and below average rainfall in particular rainfall was above the average in only three years black dots and below the average in the remaining seven years white dots this observation indicates the possibility of multiple year droughts where the rainfall is below the average for a number of years multi year droughts pose a greater risk of water scarcity than if the rainfall distribution were symmetric around the mean the middle and the right panels of fig 2 illustrate the off phase relationship between water supply and use the middle panel plots the relationship between rainfall and net inflow i e gross inflow net non consumptive outflows including evaporation leakages and releases if any the net inflow as we would expect is closely associated with rainfall and has a correlation ratio of 0 86 the right panel graphs consumptive water use outflow and rainfall that has a correlation ratio of 0 74 these two panels in fig 2 show that in relatively dry wet years when water inflow is relatively constrained available water consumption is relatively higher lower the water supply system of the act is managed by a single and government owned water supplier icon water water prices are regulated by the independent competition and regulator commission icrc to ensure non discriminatory access to monopoly and near monopoly infrastructure the overarching objective of the pricing regulation is to promote the efficient investment and operation and use of regulated services for long term interests of consumers in relation to the price quality safety reliability and security of services 17 p6 the icrc sets water prices to ensure icon water s revenues equal the sum of all recognised cost components break even pricing these costs include the operating expenditures cost of capital depreciation tax and pass through of unexpected or government mandated costs estimated over 5 year planning horizons and is cpi indexed 17 p3 18 p3 the regulated water price also includes a water abstraction charge wac which comprises the private opportunity cost of water and a public opportunity cost associated with a reduction in ecosystem services because of reduced downstream flows because of water consumption in the act 19 the current water pricing system does not include the rauc icon water has a high fixed cost of water supply and distribution and a relatively low marginal cost which ranges from 0 72 aud kl to 1 74 aud kl 20 economic theory indicates that efficient water pricing requires with full cost recovery that a water tariff which includes a fixed charge equal to the fixed cost be divided by the number of water users plus a volumetric charge equal to the marginal cost of water supply and distribution such a pricing scheme in the act require water users to pay a relatively large fixed charge to connect to the water supply system and in the absence of transfers be unaffordable for some poorer households thus to balance the cost recovery economic efficiency and affordability objectives the act combines a fixed water charge and an increasing block tariff based on water volumes used by households to meet an affordability objective the fixed charge only covers a proportion of the fixed costs and the remaining costs of supplying water are therefore recovered by ensuring the volumetric price is above the marginal cost of supply in particular the increasing block tariffs include two tiers 21 t8 1 a lower tier 1 price 2 43 aud kl in 2018 19 applied to the first 50 kl of water use per household each quarter and a higher tier 2 price 4 88 aud kl applied to the water quantity above the 50 kl per water user if any the tier 1 and tier 2 water prices apply to all users but the fixed charge may vary across resident and non resident premises 21 t9 4 in general when water prices vary across water users price heterogeneity must be accounted for when evaluating total consumer surplus when calibrating our model for the act we specified the essential water quantity to be the actual quantity at tier 1 not the maximum threshold which was 25 43 gl in 2018 19 21 or on average 140 kl per household year equivalent to around 171 litres person day this essential water use level is comparable to the average residential end use water in some developed countries i e from around 100 litres person day in the netherlands to around 250 litres person day in the usa 22 in terms of the essential water use the tier 1 water quantity in the act is higher than the subsistence level suggested by who ranging from 50 litres person day for drinking cooking personal hygiene washing home cleaning to 70 litre person day to include growing food for family use and sanitation waste disposal 23 we consider tier 2 water use to be discretionary water use and observe that the current act pricing scheme cross subsidises tier 1 water uses while paying a volumetric price slightly higher than the marginal cost tier 1 water uses pay only a proportion of their share of the fixed costs thus tier 1 consumers pay less than the average cost of the whole water supply system in turn this raises the cost of supplying water to tier 2 users above the marginal cost of water supply thus full cost recovery and affordability objectives affect the cost imposed on tier 2 water uses we include these social political objectives in our dynamic optimisation and specify the average cost of supplying discretionary water at the break even price of tier 2 water use i e 4 88 aud kl 2019 value 3 2 net inflow weather classification and water use using the data in the middle panel of fig 2 we estimated the distribution of the net inflow by fitting a generalised gamma distribution i e with the shape and the scale parameters these two parameters are estimated by the bias corrected mixed type log moment estimators of gamma distributions 24 25 to control for the small sample the statistical efficiency of this estimate can improve if more data become available in future combining the fitted gamma distribution and previous studies on the murray darling basin mdb a large catchment area that contains the act 26 27 we classify dry normal and wet weather realisations using the 25 and 75 percentile points i e a dry year has net inflow less than 25 percentile a normal year has net inflow between 25 and 75 percentile points and a wet has net inflow above 75 percentile point mathematically w d r y n o r m a l w e t where w d r y indicates a dry year when water inflow into dams is below 25 percentile point w n o r m a l indicates a normal year when water inflow is between 25 and 75 percentile points and w w e t indicates a wet year when water inflow is more than 75 percentile point in the baseline scenario we calibrate the model when there is no serial correlation in weather i e the probability of dry normal and wet weather next year is 0 25 0 5 and 0 25 respectively regardless of the current weather however when weather serial correlation is taken into account the distribution of next year s weather depends on whether the current weather is dry normal or wet this conditional probability distribution is estimated using annual inflow data since 1890 in mdb 26 i e the fractions of year t being dry normal and wet given year t 1 was a dry normal and wet year respectively as this long time series data is not available for the act we used the data in the right panel of fig 2 to approximate the average water use in dry normal and wet weather the three corresponding levels of average annual use in the act without quantity restrictions are 305 kl 288 kl 282 kl per water user subtracting the tier 1 water from the total use the annual tier 2 use per water user results in approximate water use of 165 kl 148 kl and 142 kl for dry normal and wet weather respectively in other words the tier 2 water quantities in normal and wet weather are some 90 and 86 of that in a dry weather period 3 3 calibrating the demand function for discretionary water microeconomic analysis often uses two common functional forms to calibrate demand functions namely constant price elasticity and constant slope linear functions corresponding to the log log and level level specifications 28 chapter 7 in this specific case study the mathematical property of the constant elasticity would mean that a substantial number of water users would still buy non essential water from the supplier in the act if the price were set at a very high level say 100 kl especially when the demand is inelastic we are not aware of any previous studies which provide a reliable estimate of the price elasticity of non essential water in act if we were to adopt the estimated elasticity for outdoor water use in the nearby city of sydney i e 0 59 29 we find that the constant elasticity demand function would mean that if the water supplier in act set the price of their water at 100 kl they would still be able to sell approximately 4 97 gl non essential water in 2019 this does not seem plausible given that act residents have a backstop option to purchase water from a near by catchment region and transport water to the act at a much lower cost but still higher than the current price 4 88 m3 for this reason we use the constant slope function to calibrate the demand function using the backstop price the demand function for discretionary water is represented in equation 5 where a w is the slope of the demand function the slope of the demand function can be estimated using an observed price and quantity p 0 and q p 0 w as in equation 6 the only additional parameter required is the backstop price which is the cost of water from a stable alternative source the nearest stable alternative and large supply source for the act is the snowy scheme in cooma approximately 100 km to the south this water source has relatively stable inflow from the near by snowy mountain and multiple storage capacity we assume that if water is not available in the act and if water users can afford the transportation cost plus the price of water in cooma they would be able to purchase water from the snowy scheme consequently the backstop price which includes the transportation cost plus the price of water in cooma is assumed to be 25 aud kl in the baseline scenario we varied this backstop price between 20 and 30aud kl in our sensitivity analysis 5 q p w a w p b a c k s t o p p 6 a w q p o w p b a c k s t o p p o 3 4 water restrictions how much and when water restrictions in the act occur in four progressively more constraining stages 30 these stages restrict part or all water use in 11 categories of activities including lawn hosing pave cleaning swimming pool car washing and construction related activities the four stages are expected to limit water use to 90 75 65 and 45 of the unrestricted use to date only the first three water restriction stages have ever been applied in practice in particular a stage 1 restriction was applied once in december 2002 when the storage level was 117 gl and it was quickly followed by a stage 2 restriction in april 2003 the most recent stage 2 restrictions were in november 2005 and november 2006 when the storage dropped to 104 gl and 97 gl respectively the most recent stage 3 restriction was in september 2004 but there is no published data on the storage level at that time given the historical data we specify that when the storage drops to 117 gl i e 42 of the storage capacity a stage 1 water restriction would be applied which restricts water use at 90 of the unrestricted use level if the storage level further drops to 100 gl i e 36 of the storage capacity water use would be restricted to 75 of the unrestricted level 3 5 parameterisation and solution technique table 1 summarises the parameter values for calculating the rauc in addition to those parameters presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 we specify the discount rate ρ 2 5 equal to the average 10 year australian government bond interest rate during the 2010 2019 period the planning horizon is specified at 30 years which is the expected lifespan of the current water supply system 31 p32 the number of billed water users in the base year 2019 is 178 975 and it is expected to grow by 1 4 per year 21 all parameters together with relevant sources are reported in table 1 we used the parameters in table 1 to solve the dynamic optimisation in equation 3 using bellman s principle of optimality 32 the dynamic optimisation problem does not have a closed form solution thus we used numerical approximation and the value function iteration technique to find a solution with this numerical technique the rauc is calculated at every 5 percentage point of the storage level above the restriction triggering thresholds e g 45 50 of the storage capacity and so on the values of rauc between these points are approximated using piece wise linear functions at water storage levels below the restriction triggering thresholds water restrictions are applied and the rauc is no longer relevant this is because rauc is the risk caused by current water users who consume water from current water storages noting that if consumer water restrictions are imposed marginal water consumption is regulated by an administrative measure rather than by the volumetric price in this situation increases or decreases in water price may have a distributional impact on water users and the water supplier but they will not change social welfare as measured by equation 2 4 result of the case study 4 1 baseline scenario we solved the dynamic optimisation in equation 3 and calculated the rauc specified in equation 4 the rauc varies with storage levels weather and population i e the number of water users the specific results for the base year 2019 are summarised in fig 3 our results show substantial values of the rauc ranging from around 1 1aud kl to around 4 7aud kl or equivalently from 23 to 96 of the regulated water price for discretionary water use i e 4 88aud kl in 2019 value in other words should the regulatory authority account for the risk of current water use on future water scarcity the volumetric water price of discretionary water could be substantially greater than the current regulated volumetric water price depending on the weather realisation and storage our results in fig 3 shows that the rauc in dry weather is higher than in normal and wet weather over a range of storage levels while the rauc exists with all types of weather the risk during normal and wet weather is lower because inflows are smaller during dry weather the rauc is the same in normal and wet weather in this specific case but this is not a universal result the difference across the three weather types are relatively small due to the existence of the restriction and the large storage capacity compared to annual consumption making water availability in the act more vulnerable to multiple year droughts rather and the weather variation in a particular year fig 3 illustrates an important property of the rauc previously identified by ref 7 namely the rauc increases as water storage level declines this is because an additional amount of water reduces the storage level and increase the risk of water restrictions and welfare loss this risk is greater when the current storage is close to the threshold level or when water use restrictions would be applied this property implies that the optimal volumetric water price would be lower when dams are full and would increase as the storage level declines an important result illustrated in fig 3 is that rauc may remain positive even when the storage is full this is because rauc measures the impact of reducing storage level on the risk of water restrictions in future the rauc is greater than zero if current water use were to reduce the storage level e g from 100 to 99 and if this storage reduction were to increase the risk of future water restrictions if current water use were not to reduce the full storage level e g water users were only to consume water spilling over from water storages then the rauc would be zero because there would be no impact on the risk of future water restrictions to highlight the welfare impact of incorporating rauc we compare two scenarios dynamic pricing with the rauc and business as usual bau pricing bau is the current water tariff that sets the price of water to deliver a financial break even point for icon water the welfare impact is summarised in fig 4 where the vertical axis measures the annualised surplus generated by discretionary water in monetary terms the figure shows that the total surplus associated with each pricing scheme varies with water storage levels and that dynamic water pricing generates gains over the bau approach the gap between the two levels of total surplus in fig 4 represents the gain which amounts to around 8 million aud a year 2019 value or approximately 1 5 of the surplus generated by the bau pricing approach the gain of the rauc approach arises because the risk of water restrictions declines although non essential water users also pay a higher price depending on the storage level and weather realisations as the rauc is an implicit cost of using water resources the revenue from collecting rauc would be transferred to the government rather than retained by icon water fig 5 summarises the dynamics of rauc over the 2020 2026 period as formalised in equation 4 the number of water users i e population is a determinant of the rauc thus the rauc will vary over time as the population grows this is because as the number of water users increases this places a greater demand on the water supply system all else equal and thus increases the risks of welfare reducing water restrictions 20 f4 6 f4 8 4 2 the impact of the storage level threshold for water restrictions our model assumes that decisions on restrictions of non essential water uses are not only influenced by economic objectives but also socio political considerations in other words setting a storage level threshold for water restrictions sacrifices some economic efficiency for socio political objectives if the objective were to optimise for economic efficiency there would not be any restrictions on water use here we undertake a sensitivity analysis in terms of the water storage level threshold as to when water restrictions are introduced as a proportion of the overall capacity of water stotrages in the sensitivity analysis we consider two additional scenarios should the water storage level threshold be reduced from 42 to 30 and to 10 respectively these scenarios are sufficient to capture the unlikely possibility that the act water authority were to become less risk averse in how it regulates the water supply the results of the sensitivity analysis is summarised in table 2 with the mean of the rauc at various storage levels and with different thresholds as a percentage of water storages capacity when water restrictions are implemented the results show that should the water storage threshold be reduced as to when water use restrictions are imposed non essential water users would have lower risks of water restrictions thus a lower threshold as to when water restrictions are imposed is associated with a lower rauc if all other factors remain unchanged 4 3 the impact of the backstop price the backstop price is the cost of supplying water from an alternative stable source if the backstop price were lower act residents could purchase water from a nearby catchment at a lower cost if they are restricted from using act supplied water for this reason water users would be less averse to the risk of water restrictions in future hence the rauc would be reduced if the backstop price were higher act residents would be more averse to the risk of water restrictions and the rauc would be higher we undertook a sensitivity analysis to examine how the rauc might respond to the backstop price three backstop prices were considered namely 20 25 and 30 aud kl the results are summarised in fig 6 the figure shows that the rauc increases with the level of risk aversion with a higher cost associated with purchasing water from alternative water sources back stop price water users would be more risk averse and as a result the rauc would be substantially higher 4 4 climate impacts climate change in south eastern australia is expected to increase the risk of water scarcity to urban communities 33 p13 15 these risks include two key factors first climate change may increase weather variability such that rainfall becomes scarcer in dry years and more abundant in wet years second climate change may also increase the inter annual correlation in the weather which can cause extended droughts table 3 summarises the estimated impact of climate change on rainfall in the murray darling basin a broad geographic region that contains the act the table shows the changes in expected rainfall in 2030 compared to the 1986 2005 period over four climate change scenarios where rcpx y is a representative concentration pathway global warming scenario that leads to an average of x y watts per square meter across the planet 34 the table shows that projected annual rainfall variability in the act does not vary substantially across the four scenarios but projection outcomes do predict that there would be less rain in dry years and more rain in wet years a possible impact of climate change on the risk of water scarcity is the inter annual correlation in the weather the inter annual correlation means that a dry year is more likely followed by another dry year in other words not only might there be less rain in a single dry year but there is a higher risk of consecutive dry years to quantify the impact of this inter annual correlation we adopted a weather distribution estimated for the mdb 26 as reported in table 4 this table shows that the distribution of future weather varies with current weather in contrast to the baseline scenario estimated in section 3 2 that assumes the distribution is always 0 25 0 5 0 25 the weather distribution in table 4 is more likely to result in multiple year droughts because the probability of a dry year being followed by another dry year is 35 7 while it is 25 in the baseline distribution combining the four scenarios of annual rainfall variability table 3 with the baseline weather distribution and the distribution in table 4 generates eight climate scenarios we repeatedly calculated the rauc for each climate scenario and summarised the results in table 5 the table reports for brevity and easy comparison the rauc in the year 2019 and as a benchmark for comparison across states of the world and specifies the water storage at 60 for all scenarios the results in table 5 show that the annual rainfall variability has little impact on rauc while the impact of inter annual correlation is much more important this is not a general result and would depend on the pattern of rainfall variability and where water storages are located as previously noted the act currently has a relatively large storage capacity compared to annual use e g 278 gl water storage capacity compared to 56 gl water use in the drought year of 2019 thus even when the storage is not completely full the act may have sufficient water for two or possibly three years in the worst water inflow scenario before the storage level drops to the threshold that triggers water restrictions this large water storage capacity means that in a dry year where rainfall inflow can normally fill only around 5 7 of the storage capacity some modest variability in this limited inflow would have less impact than the possibility of another dry year ahead in other words the water supply in the act can withstand annual rainfall variability better than multiple year droughts and which are predicted to increase in frequency with climate change 35 past multiple year droughts were not uncommon in the act examples include three consecutive dry years from 2001 to 2003 that triggered a series of water restrictions during the 2000s and contributed to the historic bushfire in 2003 that caused about half of the water supply system to be unavailable for household use because of inadequate water quality another period of drought was from 2017 to 2019 that resulted in the act s water storage levels declining from almost full capacity in november 2016 to below 46 capacity in january 2020 this decline in water supply led the act government to consider re applying strict water restrictions should water storage levels further decline if the water extraction could be reduced the water supply system would be able to withstand a longer drought before the storage reached an undesirable threshold as a proportion of water storage capacity 5 discussion our model is calibrated to a specific catchment area the act in australia but our results also provide general implications and insights about how to apply the rauc in other locations first there is a significant intertemporal risk caused by current water use on future water availability failing to consider this risk in water pricing decisions may result in misallocations of scarce water supplies if decision makers consider social welfare over multiple years dynamic water pricing can be used to regulate short term water demand and to improve long run planning of water resources management 36 in some cases the rauc could be a significant proportion of existing volumetric water prices second the rauc may also exist in normal and wet weather and this differs in practice to peak load pricing 37 38 while peak load pricing is usually applied to regulate demand in dry weather the rauc accounts for weather uncertainty in the future thus extracting water for use in normal and wet weather can also impose a risk on future water uses this finding is explained by the intertemporal nature of the risk i e the impact of current use on future water availability as future weather is unknown there is a certain probability of droughts such that reducing water storage levels at a given point in time may reduce the water storage system s ability to withstand future droughts especially droughts that may last several years third the rauc is an implicit economic cost and including it in the price of water assists to allocate water resources across time in a more economically efficient way unlike explicit costs such as pumping or treatment the rauc is not incurred by the water supplier for this reason the revenue from collecting rauc could be transferred to the government similar to the opportunity cost of not having water downstream or the forgone environmental benefits of having water flow which have already been included in the act s wac higher pricing revenue with a rauc could be used to support water conservation technology and possibly delay the need for costly infrastructure extension 5 39 the rauc as a component of dynamic water pricing might also provide a means to support financial stability and smooth operations of water suppliers which are both regulated by pricing decisions and subject to uncertainty in water demand 40 further establishing the rauc as part of a volumetric water price does not necessarily conflict with social considerations because the additional pricing revenue from the rauc could also be used to support low income or disadvantaged water users 10 41 fourth the rauc in a particular location may be reduced by expanding storage capacity theoretically a large storage capacity relative to annual consumption can help store water in wetter periods for drier periods thus reducing the intertemporal risk caused by water extraction nevertheless the opportunity to build larger water storage is not always a feasible option in practice because of the lack of adequate available land while additional water storage may still not be sufficient during prolonged droughts in our calibration for the act we find that the rauc may be relatively large despite recent augmentation in the water storage capacity to about five times of annual consumption fifth a necessary condition in applying rauc in practice is that water users are individually metered in terms of their volumetric water use whenever there is universal or close to household metering dynamic water pricing that includes the rauc should prove no more difficult to implement than other methods of water pricing while water prices may not be instantly updated to have an immediate impact on water consumption incorporating the rauc in the water price can send a signal of possible water scarcity in the future and thus help water supply providers and also water users better prepare for potentially prolonged droughts such preparatory pricing whereby prices vary depending on water storages but not a rauc is feasible and was introduced in 2020 in sydney australia s largest city finally while the rauc may be included in part of water tariffs to improve intertemporal allocative efficiency it is not a hedging tool against water scarcity in other words incorporating the rauc does not mean water availability is secured into the future for this reason it is important to avoid misunderstanding of the rauc as insurance against weather uncertainty that might affect the water conservation measures of communities 42 6 conclusions we formalise and simulate a risk adjusted user cost rauc into the volumetric water price charged to water consumers in an urban context we show that a rauc can increase inter temporal social surplus by providing a price signal to water consumers to adjust their current water uses by pricing the risk of their current water use on reducing future water availability our study was calibrated to the supply and distribution system in the australia capital territory we found that in this water supply system the water supply risk is substantial and this risk can be incorporated into the volumetric price of discretionary water uses we also observed that incorporating the rauc into the volumetric water price of water users would increase the inter temporal social surplus from water use relative to business as usual while our model is calibrated to the australian capital territory it can be applied to other locations around the world where there are adequate time series data on weather and water uses and water uses are metered given that extracting water from dams today will not increase water availability in the future the rauc provides an implicit link between current water use and future water availability in our view dynamic pricing that includes the rauc is especially valuable where there is a risk of reduced future water availability from weather related events such as in semi arid regions in locations where climate change is projected to increase weather variability and also in places where water demand is rapidly increasing author

8672,the purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the environmental kuznets curve ekc relationship between water quality and income within the european union considering spatial interdependences across countries to this end we apply a spatial econometrics framework using panel data at the national level for twenty eu countries across seventeen years 1998 to 2014 furthermore we account for the role of human and livestock population size institutional quality and economic openness for water quality results show that a significant ekc relationship is seen with an inverted n shaped relationship between income and water quality water quality is decreasing in income for low income levels increasing in income when gdp per capita for medium income levels and deteriorating for high income levels eight out of twenty countries have income levels associated with a declining water quality spatial spillovers between countries are significant higher livestock density levels are associated with lower levels of water quality while institutional quality and openness to trade are positively associated with water quality keywords environmental kuznets curve institutional quality spatial error model spatial spillovers water framework directive 1 introduction good water quality is crucial to human health social and economic development as well as the functioning of ecosystems 1 economic activities unabated population growth and unsustainable farming practices further increase pressures on water bodies 2 3 this poses a direct threat to the survival of marine life health risks to human and animal populations near bodies of water as well as tourism however these pressures can be counteracted through restrictions on polluting activities and improved wastewater management the european union eu adopted the so called water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec in the year 2000 to ensure that the member states achieve good ecological status in all surface water bodies despite progress only 40 of surface water bodies currently meet this requirement 3 this raises a concern regarding the potential of policy changes to counteract the increasing scale of production and consumption with respect to the impact on water quality income is seen as a major driver of human impact on water quality in earlier literature the relationship between income and water quality is frequently analysed using the so called environmental kuznets curve ekc approach 33 34 essentially an ekc relationship would be found if during the first stages of economic growth water quality degrades with higher income as policymakers and households are more concerned with higher material output than with environmental quality with technological improvements and increasing knowledge associated with later stages of industrialization economic growth increases along with greater awareness as to the effects on the environment 4 this increases governmental and industrial efficiency and leads to more stringent environmental policies which results in an increase in environmental quality 5 6 together this suggests an inverted u shaped relationship between income and environmental degradation in previous literature several studies have investigated whether an ekc relationship exists for water quality archibald et al 7 and lee et al 5 examine the ekc hypothesis across european countries using panel data with biological oxygen demand bod levels in water bodies as a proxy for water quality gassebner et al 8 also considers bod levels across a panel data set across 120 countries these studies both find that an ekc relationship is supported a couple of studies extend on the analysis by applying a spatial framework motivating this choice by the spatial overlap of natural watershed boundaries with administrative borders farzin and grogan 9 use a spatial approach while also allowing for a potentially n shaped relationship between income and water quality degradation applying their study in the context of california and considering 24 water quality variables their results confirm the existence of an n shaped ekc when using ammonia and fecal coliform bacteria as indicators of water quality spatial spillover effects are observed through spatial autocorrelation of water quality between neighbouring counties paudel et al 10 also examine the ekc relationship using a spatial approach considering nitrogen phosphorus and dissolved oxygen levels across louisiana counties they assumed that weighted income in neighbouring counties positively impacts water quality but results did not show a significant spatial effect in addition to income many ekc studies also account for several other factors that potentially affect water quality including population density for which results are mixed and agricultural activity where results indicate a negative impact on water quality 9 furthermore archibald et al 7 and gassebner et al 8 find that economic and trade liberalization positively affects water quality a summary of the main findings including turning points can be found in table 1 the main objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between water quality and income across eu countries over the time period 1998 to 2014 to this end we use the ekc approach and a spatial econometric framework the first aim is to identify whether an n shaped ekc exists rather than an inverted u shape an n shaped curve could potentially explain the slow progress towards wfd targets for good ecological status controlling for spatial effects is necessary to avoid biased estimates given the larger spatial scale of our study compared to farzin and grogan 9 and paudel et al 10 the argument for overlaps between watershed boundaries and administrative units is not equally strong instead spatial effects across countries could arise due to institutional learning or strategic behavior by governments fredriksson and millimet 2003 of course the very transboundary nature of water bodies could likely induce spillovers but the exact nature and strength of this dynamic is an empirical issue earlier results from ekc studies applied to air borne emissions in europe suggest that positive spatial correlations could be expected among the eu countries 11 12 consistent with institutional learning rather than strategic behavior given the importance of human settlements and livestock density for water quality 2 3 13 we also control for those factors the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we provide a more detailed background and present the hypotheses in section 3 we outline the econometric method and provide a description of the data section 4 presents the results from the analysis and section 5 provides a discussion and conclusions 2 background and hypotheses water pollution is characterized by spatial heterogeneity as the impact of pollution on a recipient depends on the location of the emission source moreover recipients vary in their sensitivity to pollution policies for water quality increasingly recognize the spatial perspective this was an important factor in determining the design of the wfd where it is recommended that policies are developed on the catchment level 3 14 in the following we outline our conceptual approach describing the linkages between water quality and income the role of spatial spillovers emission sources and institutions 2 1 the relationship between income and water quality despite policy reforms permitting tailoring water pollution policy to the local context and increasing income it remains unclear whether european countries will succeed to achieve good water quality the capacity of currently regulated pollution abatement measures is often not sufficient for meeting set water quality targets furthermore adding additional measures can be highly expensive 15 also institutional constraints can imply that policy costs substantially exceed those for a least cost policy which risks leading to difficulties to obtain political support for stringent policies 34 38 hence technical capacity constraints in combination with institutional inefficiencies can imply that raising income will not be sufficient for solving water quality problems it is therefore argued in the literature that a cubic relationship between real gdp per capita and water quality could be motivated rather than a quadratic relationship which is otherwise more common in ekc studies the assumption of cubic relationship allows for the possibility that improved water quality during the process of economic growth is only temporary and is eventually followed by a downturn in water quality for high income levels 9 16 17 2 2 spatial spillovers watersheds and bodies of water are not confined within a country s boundaries instead they often span more than one country as well as produce economic environmental and institutional 1 1 institutional spillovers can include for example governments learning from or mimicking neighbours choice of technologies policy instruments and enforcement practices spillover effects between countries 9 17 19 a trend of recent ekc literature has been inclusion of spatial interaction effects where studies argue that its omission can lead to biased and or inconsistent ekc estimates arising from model misspecification 7 20 22 in practical policy catchment and administrative boundaries often overlap implying that we can expect to see a correlation in environmental outcomes across jurisdictions moreover several studies on the ekc show that countries that improve their regulatory frameworks tend to positively influence the institutions and environmental performance of their neighbours through reduced spillovers and encouraging others to develop their own institutional quality 11 23 the spatial pattern can also be affected by strategic interaction in environmental policy driven by the aim of policymakers to attract labour and industry and enhance the likelihood of re election fredriksson and millimet 2003 2 3 population and livestock density water quality is influenced by population and livestock density through runoffs of nutrients 2 3 24 25 higher population densities put heavier burdens on the water environment through higher discharges in industrial and domestic wastewater 26 27 on the other hand a high population density implies that many people are concerned with water quality conditions which can imply a greater willingness to pay for measures to improve water quality and that policymakers are put under more pressure to undertake improvements 7 16 28 29 in addition high population density implies scale economies in wastewater infrastructure which also tends to counteract the negative impact on water quality hence the net effects of population density are ambiguous albeit empirically farzin and grogan 9 finds a negative impact on water quality intensive livestock farming is known to be a significant source of organic water pollution 24 we follow earlier ekc studies on water quality by accounting for the impact of livestock 6 19 noting that a significant and negative relationship with water quality was found in e g farzin and grogan 9 2 4 impact of institutional quality and openness to trade the development of countries towards a higher institutional quality and increased openness of the market can potentially affect water quality the european union explicitly states that the strengthening of institutional quality in terms of transparency effective regulation and public participation as well as improving openness to foreign investors and trade is an important tool to development which may enhance water quality 13 30 as stated by moss 31 the success of water policies such as the wfd depends on the degree of fit with existing institutional structures and practices in that respect the wfd lays emphasis on cooperation between government units across different sectors and levels transparency and public participation 2 4 1 institutional quality as countries develop this is typically associated with increased economic and social freedom better transparency higher public participation and increased accountability this can positively affect environmental quality it is deemed difficult to enforce the wfd and ensure appropriate solutions in parts of europe where effective political pressure and legislation are lacking 32 the link between institutional quality improvements and environmental quality is argued to be weaker in less developed countries where improvements in institutions may prioritize other policy targets 33 34 several studies show empirically that improvements in institutional quality are correlated with improved environmental performance 18 23 however it is not always the case that such links can be shown for example woodhouse and muller 35 find that public participation and environmental policy effectiveness are only occasionally associated 2 4 2 trade and investment openness several ekc studies account for the effect of openness to trade and foreign direct investment fdi fang et al 2018 19 such openness can lead to higher welfare increasing the demand for environmental quality and increased technology transfers that can improve environmental conditions 36 hence ignoring openness to trade and fdi may lead to model misspecification which potentially biases the estimated results 37 however the previous ekc literature has presented mixed evidence regarding openness to trade and fdi fang et al 2018 considering industrial wastewater in china states that trade openness may improve environmental quality only if it leads to a modernization of the capital stock which can outweigh the increased consumption that follows with trade on the other hand it is also argued that economic and trade liberalization may harm the environment in low income countries for example if polluting sectors relocate to low income countries that try to attract investment by providing relatively more slack environmental regulation 38 where the textile industry is argued to be one example of this 39 this ambiguity is illustrated by results in naughton 37 showing a significant spatial effect from trade and fdi for europe which either improves or worsens environmental quality depending on the level of environmental regulation and scale effects below we control for the effect of increased trade and investment openness on water quality 3 methodology we aim to identify an ekc relationship for water quality within europe taking into account the possible spatial effects relevant to this relationship to conduct a spatial econometric analysis the first step is to test for spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable for water quality within the countries following this we conduct tests to determine the appropriate econometric method this section describes these tests the econometric model as well as the descriptive features of the data 3 1 tests for spatial dependence two sets of tests are used to test for spatial autocorrelation within the dependent variable the classical global moran s i and geary s c 40 41 even though moran s i test is seen as more robust than geary s c both are included to ensure robustness 22 global here refers to a spatial dependence matrix across the entire geographic region under study in this case europe test results fall between 1 and 1 and tends to zero when no spatial autocorrelation is found positive values indicate positive spatial autocorrelation where similar values occur spatially near one another negative values indicate negative spatial autocorrelation where dissimilar values occur geographically close to conduct these tests an appropriate spatial weight matrix is created denoted by w which is a first order contiguity n n matrix that characterizes the degree of spatial dependence of the studied spatial units within the geographical region of interest the weight matrix has diagonal elements equal to zero so that a country cannot be its own neighbour and w i j elsewhere where w i j 1 if i and j are neighbours and w i j 0 if otherwise 42 in this study the spatial weight matrix used in our baseline empirical estimations focuses on the k nearest neighbours of each country here six separate weight matrices are created from k 1 6 nearest neighbours the weights in each matrix are then row standardized such that the sum of the elements equals one which ensures that relative not absolute distance matters 43 in the robustness analysis alternative spatial matrices are used considering distance as well as upstream downstream relationships between countries that share common water bodies 3 2 tests for econometric method selection following standard practice in applied spatial econometric literature 42 44 we begin with a non spatial pooled ordinary least squares ols regression model which is used as a baseline and is given below in equation 1 1 y i t α x i t β ε i t ε i t n 0 σ 2 where α is the intercept and x i t a vector of explanatory variables and its associated parameters β for cross section i at time t following this we test for the possibility to extend the baseline model to include spatial interaction effects as discussed in section 2 there may exist spatial dependence not only in the dependent variable water quality but also in the explanatory variables we may then expand the baseline model using a general specification for static spatial panel models to include these effects as shown in equation 2 2 y i t τ n α i λ w i j y j x i t β θ w i j x i t ξ i ψ t μ i t μ i t ρ w i j μ i t ε i t ε i t n 0 σ 2 i 1 n t 1 t where y is the vector for the dependent variable for each unit of the sample i 1 n τ n is the n k vector of ones for the constant term α and β and θ are the k 1 vector of parameters associated with the n k matrix of explanatory variables and the spatially explicit explanatory variables respectively these explanatory variables include the natural logged ln values of gdp lngdp the squared and cubed values of this natural log lngdp 2 2 austria belgium cyprus czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg netherlands poland slovakia spain sweden and united kingdom and lngdp 3 3 for example data on oxygen content for hungary was available for 1987 2007 which is a long time period however data before 1998 was available for few other countries hence hungary was excluded from the analysis due to the lack of data for recent years and difficulties to match the time series with the other countries as another example oxygen data for portugal were only available for 2006 2012 motivating exclusion of portugal in the analysis the logged values of population density lnpopdens and livestock density livedens governance indicators govind trade openness trade as well as openness to foreign direct investment fdi the variables ρ and λ denote the spatial autoregressive or lag and the spatial autocorrelation coefficients respectively the parameters ξ i and ψ denote the spatial specific and time fixed effects finally ε denotes a vector of disturbance terms such that ε ε 1 ε n t where ε i is assumed to be independently and identically distributed for all i with a mean of zero and a variance of σ 2 using the spatial weight matrices detailed in section 3 1 we run the classical langrage multiplier lm anselin 1988 and the robust lm rlm anselin et al 1996 tests on the residuals of the estimated ols model these tests indicate if we can reject the ols specification in favour of the spatial error sem or spatial lag sar model if we reject the ols model in favour of both the sem and sar models this suggests that a spatial durbin model is appropriate these results are detailed within section 4 2 given the tests for econometric model selection we can write the spatial lag model i e where θ 0 ρ 0 in equation 3 as 3 y i t λ w i j y j t x i t β ξ i ε i t t 1 t all variables are as previously defined the spatial autoregressive coefficient is given by λ to which a statistically significant result would indicate a sizeable intensity of spatial interdependency including the explanatory variables contained in the vector x i t we have the following specification equation 4 which also includes a time trend 4 y i t λ w i j y j t β 1 ln g d p i t β 2 ln g d p i t 2 β 3 ln g d p i t 3 β 4 ln p o p d e n s i t β 5 l i v e d e n s i t β 6 g o v e f f i t β 7 ln t r a d e i t β 8 f d i i t t i m e t ξ ε i t given the above equations and if an ekc relationship is seen the turning points are calculated to determine the real gdp per capita range to which water quality would begin to improve 3 3 data description our dependent variable for water quality is given through the measure of the oxygen content within bodies of water the oxygen content is one of the major indicators used to evaluate ecological status according to the wfd 3 if the oxygen level is too low this can affect the composition of aquatic species communities and reduce fish stocks hence the oxygen level is crucial for the delivery of surface water ecosystem services the oxygen content is determined by natural conditions as well human activities causing nutrient emissions from point and nonpoint sources and soil erosion the wfd also considers additional water quality indicators such as phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations however oxygen contents data show a considerably better coverage across time and countries compared to the nutrient related measures which motivates our choice to focus on this variable still it can be noted that nutrient levels are negatively related to oxygen levels as nutrient emissions lead to excessive growth of plants and algae which when decaying consume oxygen and therefore cause oxygen deficiency this study constructs a balanced panel data for 20 countries 2 within the european union over the years 1998 2014 where data is on an annual basis the choice of countries to include was determined by the availability of a sufficiently long time series of data including also data for recent years for the dependent variable 3 considering the oxygen content within bodies of surface water oxy 4 4 due to issues of missing data where in total 304 out of 340 observations are given from oxygen content levels linear inter and extrapolation is used in order to conduct spatial analysis a table for data description of the non extrapolated data is provided in supplementary appendix a table sa1 our data are median values measured in mg l and are collected from the european environment agency s eea 45 database waterbase for each country apart from sweden to which data is provided by the mvm database 46 which is constructed by the swedish university of agricultural sciences waterbase contains water quality data which was delivered by the member states countries and cooperating countries 5 5 the countries report these data within the scope of the current wise soe water quality icm wise 6 reporting obligation and the retired wise soe water quality wise 4 river quality ewn 1 lake quality ewn 2 and groundwater quality ewn 3 reporting obligations the purpose of waterbase is to provide indicators for the assessment of state and trends in water quality and to monitor the progress of european policy objectives the fact that the data are regularly used for policy evaluation supports their relevance in our analysis still the dataset has limitations although the eu increasingly demands harmonization of environmental monitoring monitoring schemes could potentially vary across countries for example the frequency of sampling might differ also it could be possible that within a given country some regions are subject to more intensive monitoring than others together this motivates us to use of the median values of the dependent variable across all surface water monitoring stations the median is a more representative measure of the distribution in this situation as the role of outliers is reduced income is measured as real gdp per capita given in constant 2010 us dollars 47 population density popdens is measured by population per square kilometre 48 livestock density livedens is calculated by using total livestock data 49 which we recalculated as livestock units using coefficient provided by eurostat 49 and shown in supplementary appendix table sa2 we then calculated the number of livestock units per square kilometre which was used in the regressions the worldwide governance indicators wgi are provided by the world bank 50 which detail the level of institutional quality in particular they detail four key variables 1 voice and accountability voice 2 government effectiveness goveff 3 regulatory quality reg 4 control of corruption corrup and 5 rule of law law these indicators are measured on a scale from 2 5 weak governance to 2 5 strong governance due to missing data for the years 1999 and 2001 linear interpolation is used to ensure a balanced dataset the indicators are highly correlated with correlation coefficients above 0 8 see supplementary appendix table sa3 the baseline estimations this study therefore uses government effectiveness goveff as a representative for the series of governance indicators finally trade openness trade is measured as the total level of imports and exports of goods and services measured as a percentage of gdp 51 the total level of foreign direct investment fdi is measured as a percentage of gdp 52 a summary of descriptive statistics for each variable discussed can be seen below in table 2 a time trend time is also included given by a series of dummy variables representing each year to remove any potential linear trend caused by the timeline 4 results in this section we first present the tests for spatial dependence in the dependent variable oxygen content secondly the non spatial panel ols model given in equation 1 was used as discussed in section 3 to conduct tests for econometric method selection finally this is followed by an estimation and analysis of results obtained using the spatial lag model slm given in equation 4 4 1 baseline tests for spatial dependence the results of the moran s i and geary s c tests using the constructed the spatial weight matrices for k 1 6 nearest neighbours are seen below in table 3 the results show that for each weight matrix results are significant at the 1 statistical level with a positive value from moran s i test these results are also backed up from the results for geary s c test this indicates that positive spatial autocorrelation is observed between the european countries within the dependent variable which confirms that we may continue to test which spatial econometric method is appropriate 4 2 spatial econometric method selection from the results given below in table 4 we can see that the global moran s i test on the regression residuals in each ols model specification is significant at the 1 statistical level across the different spatial weight matrices an indication of the presence of spatial spillovers the classical lm tests for the spatial error and spatial lag models also show statistical significance for k 2 to 6 nearest neighbours however from results of the robust lm rlm tests we see that the results for the spatial error show no statistical significance the tests for the spatial lag model reveal statistical significance at the 5 level for k 2 to 6 nearest neighbours from these results we may deduce that from the presence of significant spatial dependence in the data it would be inappropriate for the ekc model to be estimated via ols as this may yield biased and inconsistent estimates and that it may be best to estimate a spatial lag model previous literature also contends that possible omitted variable bias affects spatial regression models less than that for ols regression where such effects and spatial dependence are in the spatial lag term for the case of the spatial lag model slm 53 54 4 3 pooled ols regression the results of the pooled ols model is shown in column 1 of table 5 we see that the values for real gdp per capita are statistically significant at the 1 level throughout these results indicate the existence of the ekc showing the expected result of an inverse n shape between oxygen content and real gdp per capita results also show that livestock density and government effectiveness are statistically significant at the 1 level here results suggest that increases in government effectiveness are associated with higher levels in oxygen content whilst increases in livestock density are associated with decreasing levels in oxygen content however given the tests for spatial autocorrelation given in section 4 2 the existence of spatial spillovers is seen within the model which indicate that the non spatial ols estimates may be severely biased and inconsistent thus we continue to estimate the panel spatial lag model via maximum likelihood 4 4 spatial regressions given equation 4 we present the results as shown below in table 5 of the maximum likelihood estimations of the spatial lag model using fixed effects see columns 2 6 firstly we see that lambda which denotes the spatial autocorrelation coefficients is significant at the 1 level with a positive value this indicates that there exist significant spatial spillovers within the model overall we may see that the total effect of our independent variables may not only have direct consequences within a given country s own water quality but also through indirect consequences on other countries through spatial spillovers the estimates from the slm model cannot be interpreted as partial derivatives in the typical regression model fashion 55 in order to obtain the correct signs and magnitudes of the coefficients it is necessary to conduct an impact analysis as outlined by lesage and pace 44 where we also obtain the direct indirect and total impacts which detail the effects from home from neighbours and the total impact respectively these results are shown below in table 6 considering the total impacts results show that gdp per capita including the squared and cubic values are consistently significant at the 1 level this displays an ekc relationship with the expected signs and inverted n shape results also show that livestock density livedens is significant at the 1 level throughout government effectiveness goveff is also significant at the 1 and 5 level for k 1 and k 2 6 neighbours respectively trade lntrade is also significant at the 10 level for k 4 6 neighbours finally significance is observed at the 10 level for the time trend time results not shown for k 4 6 neighbours for the results of lntrade and time as these results are not consistent throughout this implies a less than robust outcome the results imply that with a positive sign for goveff and lntrade countries with a higher level of government effectiveness and trade openness are associated with higher oxygen content levels with a negative sign observed for livedens this suggests that an increase in livestock density is associated with lower oxygen content levels an interesting observation is that the indirect impacts neighborhood effects are consistently lower in magnitude than the direct impacts apart from when six neighbours are considered this implies that the impacts domestically are higher than those from neighbouring countries comparing these results to that from the ols estimation it appears that the coefficient estimates from the latter assuming independent observations may display substantial bias we see this as results for trade and the time trend were not significant in the ols regression but are significant within the spatial model however neither the spatial nor the ols models show statistical significance for population density and fdi following the approach by plassman and khanna 2007 for calculating the turning points from a cubic function using the total impacts we obtain the point to which oxygen content begins to improve and the point to which oxygen content begins to worsen again given the level of real gdp per capita the results show that the first turning point is within the range of 22 749 and 27 246 usd we find that the second turning point to which oxygen content begins to fall is within the range of 35 686 and 40 311 usd as shown in table 2 we see that the current average real gdp per capita 27 481 usd is just greater than the initial turning point range but less than the second turning point calculated this would suggest that on average the current economic development within europe is associated with increases in oxygen content hence improved water quality considering individual countries table a1 in the appendix we take the average real gdp per capita values given in thousands of usd across two periods period 1 1998 2005 and period 2 2006 2014 from these results we see that most countries considered fall between each turning point range however the czech republic estonia latvia lithuania poland and slovakia are below the first turning point across both periods indicating that economic development can imply a decrease in water quality 6 6 in this context it can be relevant to note that one could intuitively expect that water quality would be lower in the east european countries for example because of the history of large overuse of fertilizers in the agricultural sector during the soviet era until the 1990 in spite of such expectations upwards trends in nutrient concentrations were found after the soviet era when using in long term monitoring data in estonia and latvia 56 an observation which is consistent with our results the east european countries were further required to undertake substantial changes in their economic and environmental policy institutions as part of the conditions for joining the eu in 2007 the historical and institutional differences between the east european countries and other countries are captured in our analysis through the governance indicators and the country fixed effects also denmark and luxembourg have average real gdp per capita rates that are above the second turning point in both periods which indicate that their economic development in the two periods has been high enough to be associated with declines in water quality we also see from the results that cyprus and spain in period 1 has an average gdp rate below the first turning point but a value in period 2 within the turning point ranges this indicates that their economic development has improved across time to be consistent with a change from decreases to increases in oxygen content 4 5 robustness checks for robustness two other estimations were conducted with the first including only real gdp per capita as a predictor of water oxygen content the second estimation includes also the variables for population and livestock density popdens and livedens for these results were consistent with the values given in the estimation provided in table 5 with very similar levels in the spatial autoregressive coefficient as well the results are not shown here for reasons of brevity and space we also tested the result of including all governance indicator variables instead of one representative variable as done in the main results section the results for the income variable are seen in the appendix table a2 and the full results can be found in the supplementary appendix table sa4 we observe that the results are largely the same at the expected sign and with similar impacts from gdp per capita livestock density and trade openness 7 7 only gdp results are shown to conserve space for full results see table sa4 in the supplementary appendix from the results of the governance indicators we see statistical significance with a positive value for government effectiveness goveff as well as voice and accountability voice significance is also observed for regulatory quality but with a negative coefficient however due to the level of correlation between these variables including all five together produces a result that would be heavily biased and may produce inconsistent outcomes we also tested alternate specifications of the spatial weighting matrix considering other spatial relationships than the number of nearest neighbours first we considered the distance between centroids within the spatial matrix i e 200 km 400 km etc doing this we find that the results were very similar to the results given above and did not change conclusions for the sake of brevity the results are not shown here in the case of water quality the physical spillovers of pollutants between different spatial units can be expected to depend on whether they are located upstream or downstream and whether they share common water bodies such as international rivers to account for the role of such physical spillovers in water quality we proceeded as follows first we constructed different spatial weight matrices to capture this physical relationship as closely as possible for this purpose we used geospatial information maps from the water information system for europe wise of the wfd reference database for 2016 the latest available version this data is reported to the european commission under the wfd reporting requirement on member countries we then combined geodata on river basin districts and surface water body shapefiles to determine countries that share a common water body a river basin district covers an area of land and sea consisting of one or more neighbouring river basins along with associated coastal waters surface water body geo information on the other hand is defined as a body of surface water with significant element of water surface like a lake river stream or a transnational waterbody or coastal water 8 8 https www eea europa eu data and maps data wise wfd protected areas 1 based on the above information we first constructed a symmetric spatial weight matrix where w i j 1 if two or more countries share a common waterbody and w i j 0 otherwise we do not distinguish between upstream and downstream countries in this specification we call this matrix a symmetric contiguous spatial weight matrix see refs 57 58 a second matrix is created by also accounting for the physical elevation of each country average elevation values are compared between neighbour s who share a common waterbody to determine upstream versus downstream states a country with a higher elevation value to its neighbour s with a shared waterbody is considered to be an upstream candidate with its river potentially flowing downstream to its neighbour s in this case the weight for an upstream state is assigned the value w i j 1 as a neighbour to the downstream states the reverse cannot hold for the downstream state s in relation to its upstream neighbour s for which w i j 0 thus resulting in an asymmetric contiguous spatial weight matrix for example given the elevation of austria 910 m compared to the czech republic 91 m and germany 263 m who are contiguous in relation to a shared waterbody we assume austria to be an upstream neighbour to czech republic and germany similarly germany is assumed to be an upstream neighbour to netherlands 30 m and denmark 34 m while this approach is arguably a simplification it does to some degree account for the transboundary nature of water pollution considered in this study 9 9 for example this weight matrix does not take into account the location of watershed boundaries within a country which affect the water flows from one country to another however it should be noted that the physical impact of one country on water quality in another cannot be determined only by taking the size of common watersheds into account another factors that also matters as the size of runoff and water flows to our knowledge there is no data on the magnitude of the actual transports of water pollutants between countries across europe moreover there are many cases where the upstream and downstream relationships between countries is unclear including for example lakes and rivers located on the border between two countries and coastal areas in the neighborhood of a country border for the two constructed weight matrices we row standardize them following standard practice in applied spatial econometrics literature the third and final weight matrix developed to reflect physical spillovers uses the preceding asymmetric matrix but in this case we assign a bigger weight to the impact of upstream countries on their downstream neighbour s 1 compared to that of downstream countries on their upstream neighbour s 0 5 the intuition is that the downstream neighbours are more exposed to the negative water pollution externality from upstream neighbours than the opposite 57 although the process of assigning the weight is ad hoc following takahashi et al 57 this approach reflects the possibility of mutual physical impacts also in the case where an upstream downstream relationship could be expected to dominate all three weight matrixes for physical spillovers can be found in table sa4 in the supplementary appendix using the three different constructed spatial weight matrices above we re estimated the baseline sar model as another check of sensitivity of the results the results for both the first stage estimates and associated marginal impacts for income are shown in table a3 in the appendix overall the results are comparable to those from the slm model evidently we still observe a significant inverted n shaped ekc relationship as in the baseline this observation is robust even if we control for all the governance indicators table a4 in the appendix the only noticeable difference between these results and the baseline estimates lie with the spatial interaction parameter λ which changes direction to negative furthermore we compare the baseline results with those from alternative spatial panel models such as the spatial error model sem spatial autoregressive model with autocorrelated errors sac and the spatial durbin model sdm the sdm allowed us to properly account for spatial interaction in the governance indicators by including additional spatially weighted covariates to capture potential spillovers of these indicators on neighbouring states water quality in all these models we utilize the same three spatial weight matrices reflecting physical spillovers constructed for the preceding robustness check most important our conclusion regarding the ekc relation still holds irrespective of the model see table sa6 and sa7 in the supplementary appendix the results further imply that improved government effectiveness goveff in a neighbouring country is significantly associated with higher water oxygen content levels in the domestic country column 8 in table sa5 supplementary appendix however when we incorporate all the government indices in the respective sdm models the evidence is less satisfactory but the ekc results still hold in that case we find that only that the rule of law law and regulatory quality reg in neighbouring states improves water quality in own jurisdiction 10 10 results are available on request baseline results are finally compared with the case where none of the variables are log transformed while the results on the ekc curvature are qualitatively consistent with the baseline findings the magnitudes are less informative in terms of interpretation table sa8 in supplementary appendix the near zero coefficient estimates especially of the income variables might be due to scaling problems this makes the log transformed specification more preferable which is a feature extant in the ekc literature 5 discussion and conclusions the purpose of this study was to estimate the relationship between real gdp per capita and water quality proxied by oxygen content levels within europe using a spatial panel approach with a cubic function for national income furthermore this study also addresses criticisms of the traditional ekc approaches through use of a cubic function and addition of institutional quality and market openness variables results show a strong significant relationship between oxygen content and income with the expected inverted n shape which shows an ekc relationship from estimated turning points of 22 749 to 27 246 usd for the initial turning point and 35 686 to 40 311 usd for the second turning point furthermore our initial turning point range is similar of that by gassebner et al 8 26 800 usd while it is below that given by lee et al 5 38 220 usd both our estimated turning points are considerably less than those estimated by farzin and grogan 9 the two former study bod levels which are related to oxygen contents whereas the latter considered ammonia and fecal coliform bacteria which can explain the difference in results we can then gather that the current average real gdp per capita within europe falls within the bounds estimated in this paper therefore one would be inclined to assume that on average economic development within europe should be expected to lead to improved water quality however our results also show that this may not necessarily be the case the reason is that a considerable number of countries have either a too low or too high income per capita to be in the range where economic development is associated water quality improvements this observation tends to support results in torras and boyce 1998 and rupasingha et al 16 suggesting that income inequality is associated with a worsening of water quality torras and boyce 1998 argue that this could be motivated by a more equitable distribution of power contributing positively to environmental quality by enhancing the influence on policy of those who bear the costs of pollution relative to the influence of those who benefit from pollution generating activities however this explanation would not apply in our case where we have inequality between countries rather than within the same jurisdiction instead our results offer a different explanation for the negative relationship between income inequality and water quality namely the existence of an inverted n shaped ekc this raises a concern regarding how eu countries that fall outside the ranges of sustainable economic development can achieve their water quality targets secondly spatial autocorrelation is significant throughout our analysis displaying that spatial spillovers related to environmental and institutional factors between countries are an important feature in ekc analysis thus inclusion of spatial effects in the analysis is necessary to avoid biased estimates this is consistent with previous literature emphasizing the importance for such analysis 20 21 as well as empirical analysis considering the linkage between explanatory variables and water quality 9 significance of spatial spillovers did not decrease when considering additional nearest neighbours contradicting findings from ref 59 that spillovers are constrained by national borders with immediate neighbours furthermore with direct effects being consistently of a larger magnitude than indirect effects within the impact analyses this would infer to us that the domestic effects are larger than that from neighbouring countries whereas our baseline estimations which account for the general spatial impact of the nearest neighbours show significant and positive spatial spillovers the spatial spillovers are significant and negative when using different spatial matrices specifically reflecting shared water bodies and the upstream downstream nature of the physical pollutant spillovers although our conclusions on the impact of our explanatory variables are robust to the choice of spatial matrix this implies that we cannot draw any strong conclusions on the nature and drivers of the spatial effects negative spatial interactions are sometimes interpreted as being a consequence of strategic environmental policymaking where countries could choose to apply lax regulation in order to attract investments 60 fredriksson and millimet 2003 61 millimet and roy 2010 however it is not evident that such an interpretation is relevant in this case given the positive spatial interaction in the baseline model instead the negative spatial effects when using the physical spillover matrices could potentially be due to the limited number of non zero values in the spatial weight matrices ultimately explained by the exclusion of several countries due to lack of data for the dependent variable another potential explanation could be that economic activities impacting water quality are non uniformly distributed within countries for example an upstream country could have high water quality in large parts of its territory but polluting activity could be located close to the border to downstream countries which might generate the observed outcome hence future research including additional countries would be valuable to further examine the magnitude of physical spillover effects however the baseline model allows us to capture both physical economic and institutional spillovers and indicates that the sum of those together exert a positive spillover effect between countries the results show that increased livestock density is associated with lower levels of water quality this fits in with findings by e g ephraim et al 62 and wen et al 19 although higher livestock density could be associated by pointification of nonpoint emissions allowing for more efficient nutrient mitigation techniques this is not sufficient to offset the negative impact of livestock on water quality results show that increased population density has no significance which contradicts findings in the literature 7 27 28 63 our results on the representative indicator for the five governance indicators government effectiveness was significant with a positive sign this stands in line to assertions by previous literature sources 18 23 neef 64 and brown 34 criticizes analysis using national governance indices where such variables ignore the differences between national and local governance this is argued to be problematic as national policy may either not reflect resistance from local communities asymmetry of knowledge or may understate potential benefits of devolved decision making future studies may look to assess the relative importance of local and national governance given the importance of local decisions for water quality 29 65 our results also show that openness to trade has a significant effect in the positive direction this result fits in with findings by aklin 36 and fang et al 2018 as well as previous literature on water quality in the ekc context 7 8 together these results suggest that strengthening of governance and increased economic openness could potentially help remediating water quality problems a limitation of this study is the limited time dimension of the dataset which precludes analysis of the impact of common eu policies specifically targeting water pollution such as the nitrate and wastewater directives on water quality within the union furthermore missing data was an issue with certain european countries having little to no data available as data becomes more readily available future studies may exploit this topic declaration of competing interest the

8672,the purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the environmental kuznets curve ekc relationship between water quality and income within the european union considering spatial interdependences across countries to this end we apply a spatial econometrics framework using panel data at the national level for twenty eu countries across seventeen years 1998 to 2014 furthermore we account for the role of human and livestock population size institutional quality and economic openness for water quality results show that a significant ekc relationship is seen with an inverted n shaped relationship between income and water quality water quality is decreasing in income for low income levels increasing in income when gdp per capita for medium income levels and deteriorating for high income levels eight out of twenty countries have income levels associated with a declining water quality spatial spillovers between countries are significant higher livestock density levels are associated with lower levels of water quality while institutional quality and openness to trade are positively associated with water quality keywords environmental kuznets curve institutional quality spatial error model spatial spillovers water framework directive 1 introduction good water quality is crucial to human health social and economic development as well as the functioning of ecosystems 1 economic activities unabated population growth and unsustainable farming practices further increase pressures on water bodies 2 3 this poses a direct threat to the survival of marine life health risks to human and animal populations near bodies of water as well as tourism however these pressures can be counteracted through restrictions on polluting activities and improved wastewater management the european union eu adopted the so called water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec in the year 2000 to ensure that the member states achieve good ecological status in all surface water bodies despite progress only 40 of surface water bodies currently meet this requirement 3 this raises a concern regarding the potential of policy changes to counteract the increasing scale of production and consumption with respect to the impact on water quality income is seen as a major driver of human impact on water quality in earlier literature the relationship between income and water quality is frequently analysed using the so called environmental kuznets curve ekc approach 33 34 essentially an ekc relationship would be found if during the first stages of economic growth water quality degrades with higher income as policymakers and households are more concerned with higher material output than with environmental quality with technological improvements and increasing knowledge associated with later stages of industrialization economic growth increases along with greater awareness as to the effects on the environment 4 this increases governmental and industrial efficiency and leads to more stringent environmental policies which results in an increase in environmental quality 5 6 together this suggests an inverted u shaped relationship between income and environmental degradation in previous literature several studies have investigated whether an ekc relationship exists for water quality archibald et al 7 and lee et al 5 examine the ekc hypothesis across european countries using panel data with biological oxygen demand bod levels in water bodies as a proxy for water quality gassebner et al 8 also considers bod levels across a panel data set across 120 countries these studies both find that an ekc relationship is supported a couple of studies extend on the analysis by applying a spatial framework motivating this choice by the spatial overlap of natural watershed boundaries with administrative borders farzin and grogan 9 use a spatial approach while also allowing for a potentially n shaped relationship between income and water quality degradation applying their study in the context of california and considering 24 water quality variables their results confirm the existence of an n shaped ekc when using ammonia and fecal coliform bacteria as indicators of water quality spatial spillover effects are observed through spatial autocorrelation of water quality between neighbouring counties paudel et al 10 also examine the ekc relationship using a spatial approach considering nitrogen phosphorus and dissolved oxygen levels across louisiana counties they assumed that weighted income in neighbouring counties positively impacts water quality but results did not show a significant spatial effect in addition to income many ekc studies also account for several other factors that potentially affect water quality including population density for which results are mixed and agricultural activity where results indicate a negative impact on water quality 9 furthermore archibald et al 7 and gassebner et al 8 find that economic and trade liberalization positively affects water quality a summary of the main findings including turning points can be found in table 1 the main objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between water quality and income across eu countries over the time period 1998 to 2014 to this end we use the ekc approach and a spatial econometric framework the first aim is to identify whether an n shaped ekc exists rather than an inverted u shape an n shaped curve could potentially explain the slow progress towards wfd targets for good ecological status controlling for spatial effects is necessary to avoid biased estimates given the larger spatial scale of our study compared to farzin and grogan 9 and paudel et al 10 the argument for overlaps between watershed boundaries and administrative units is not equally strong instead spatial effects across countries could arise due to institutional learning or strategic behavior by governments fredriksson and millimet 2003 of course the very transboundary nature of water bodies could likely induce spillovers but the exact nature and strength of this dynamic is an empirical issue earlier results from ekc studies applied to air borne emissions in europe suggest that positive spatial correlations could be expected among the eu countries 11 12 consistent with institutional learning rather than strategic behavior given the importance of human settlements and livestock density for water quality 2 3 13 we also control for those factors the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we provide a more detailed background and present the hypotheses in section 3 we outline the econometric method and provide a description of the data section 4 presents the results from the analysis and section 5 provides a discussion and conclusions 2 background and hypotheses water pollution is characterized by spatial heterogeneity as the impact of pollution on a recipient depends on the location of the emission source moreover recipients vary in their sensitivity to pollution policies for water quality increasingly recognize the spatial perspective this was an important factor in determining the design of the wfd where it is recommended that policies are developed on the catchment level 3 14 in the following we outline our conceptual approach describing the linkages between water quality and income the role of spatial spillovers emission sources and institutions 2 1 the relationship between income and water quality despite policy reforms permitting tailoring water pollution policy to the local context and increasing income it remains unclear whether european countries will succeed to achieve good water quality the capacity of currently regulated pollution abatement measures is often not sufficient for meeting set water quality targets furthermore adding additional measures can be highly expensive 15 also institutional constraints can imply that policy costs substantially exceed those for a least cost policy which risks leading to difficulties to obtain political support for stringent policies 34 38 hence technical capacity constraints in combination with institutional inefficiencies can imply that raising income will not be sufficient for solving water quality problems it is therefore argued in the literature that a cubic relationship between real gdp per capita and water quality could be motivated rather than a quadratic relationship which is otherwise more common in ekc studies the assumption of cubic relationship allows for the possibility that improved water quality during the process of economic growth is only temporary and is eventually followed by a downturn in water quality for high income levels 9 16 17 2 2 spatial spillovers watersheds and bodies of water are not confined within a country s boundaries instead they often span more than one country as well as produce economic environmental and institutional 1 1 institutional spillovers can include for example governments learning from or mimicking neighbours choice of technologies policy instruments and enforcement practices spillover effects between countries 9 17 19 a trend of recent ekc literature has been inclusion of spatial interaction effects where studies argue that its omission can lead to biased and or inconsistent ekc estimates arising from model misspecification 7 20 22 in practical policy catchment and administrative boundaries often overlap implying that we can expect to see a correlation in environmental outcomes across jurisdictions moreover several studies on the ekc show that countries that improve their regulatory frameworks tend to positively influence the institutions and environmental performance of their neighbours through reduced spillovers and encouraging others to develop their own institutional quality 11 23 the spatial pattern can also be affected by strategic interaction in environmental policy driven by the aim of policymakers to attract labour and industry and enhance the likelihood of re election fredriksson and millimet 2003 2 3 population and livestock density water quality is influenced by population and livestock density through runoffs of nutrients 2 3 24 25 higher population densities put heavier burdens on the water environment through higher discharges in industrial and domestic wastewater 26 27 on the other hand a high population density implies that many people are concerned with water quality conditions which can imply a greater willingness to pay for measures to improve water quality and that policymakers are put under more pressure to undertake improvements 7 16 28 29 in addition high population density implies scale economies in wastewater infrastructure which also tends to counteract the negative impact on water quality hence the net effects of population density are ambiguous albeit empirically farzin and grogan 9 finds a negative impact on water quality intensive livestock farming is known to be a significant source of organic water pollution 24 we follow earlier ekc studies on water quality by accounting for the impact of livestock 6 19 noting that a significant and negative relationship with water quality was found in e g farzin and grogan 9 2 4 impact of institutional quality and openness to trade the development of countries towards a higher institutional quality and increased openness of the market can potentially affect water quality the european union explicitly states that the strengthening of institutional quality in terms of transparency effective regulation and public participation as well as improving openness to foreign investors and trade is an important tool to development which may enhance water quality 13 30 as stated by moss 31 the success of water policies such as the wfd depends on the degree of fit with existing institutional structures and practices in that respect the wfd lays emphasis on cooperation between government units across different sectors and levels transparency and public participation 2 4 1 institutional quality as countries develop this is typically associated with increased economic and social freedom better transparency higher public participation and increased accountability this can positively affect environmental quality it is deemed difficult to enforce the wfd and ensure appropriate solutions in parts of europe where effective political pressure and legislation are lacking 32 the link between institutional quality improvements and environmental quality is argued to be weaker in less developed countries where improvements in institutions may prioritize other policy targets 33 34 several studies show empirically that improvements in institutional quality are correlated with improved environmental performance 18 23 however it is not always the case that such links can be shown for example woodhouse and muller 35 find that public participation and environmental policy effectiveness are only occasionally associated 2 4 2 trade and investment openness several ekc studies account for the effect of openness to trade and foreign direct investment fdi fang et al 2018 19 such openness can lead to higher welfare increasing the demand for environmental quality and increased technology transfers that can improve environmental conditions 36 hence ignoring openness to trade and fdi may lead to model misspecification which potentially biases the estimated results 37 however the previous ekc literature has presented mixed evidence regarding openness to trade and fdi fang et al 2018 considering industrial wastewater in china states that trade openness may improve environmental quality only if it leads to a modernization of the capital stock which can outweigh the increased consumption that follows with trade on the other hand it is also argued that economic and trade liberalization may harm the environment in low income countries for example if polluting sectors relocate to low income countries that try to attract investment by providing relatively more slack environmental regulation 38 where the textile industry is argued to be one example of this 39 this ambiguity is illustrated by results in naughton 37 showing a significant spatial effect from trade and fdi for europe which either improves or worsens environmental quality depending on the level of environmental regulation and scale effects below we control for the effect of increased trade and investment openness on water quality 3 methodology we aim to identify an ekc relationship for water quality within europe taking into account the possible spatial effects relevant to this relationship to conduct a spatial econometric analysis the first step is to test for spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable for water quality within the countries following this we conduct tests to determine the appropriate econometric method this section describes these tests the econometric model as well as the descriptive features of the data 3 1 tests for spatial dependence two sets of tests are used to test for spatial autocorrelation within the dependent variable the classical global moran s i and geary s c 40 41 even though moran s i test is seen as more robust than geary s c both are included to ensure robustness 22 global here refers to a spatial dependence matrix across the entire geographic region under study in this case europe test results fall between 1 and 1 and tends to zero when no spatial autocorrelation is found positive values indicate positive spatial autocorrelation where similar values occur spatially near one another negative values indicate negative spatial autocorrelation where dissimilar values occur geographically close to conduct these tests an appropriate spatial weight matrix is created denoted by w which is a first order contiguity n n matrix that characterizes the degree of spatial dependence of the studied spatial units within the geographical region of interest the weight matrix has diagonal elements equal to zero so that a country cannot be its own neighbour and w i j elsewhere where w i j 1 if i and j are neighbours and w i j 0 if otherwise 42 in this study the spatial weight matrix used in our baseline empirical estimations focuses on the k nearest neighbours of each country here six separate weight matrices are created from k 1 6 nearest neighbours the weights in each matrix are then row standardized such that the sum of the elements equals one which ensures that relative not absolute distance matters 43 in the robustness analysis alternative spatial matrices are used considering distance as well as upstream downstream relationships between countries that share common water bodies 3 2 tests for econometric method selection following standard practice in applied spatial econometric literature 42 44 we begin with a non spatial pooled ordinary least squares ols regression model which is used as a baseline and is given below in equation 1 1 y i t α x i t β ε i t ε i t n 0 σ 2 where α is the intercept and x i t a vector of explanatory variables and its associated parameters β for cross section i at time t following this we test for the possibility to extend the baseline model to include spatial interaction effects as discussed in section 2 there may exist spatial dependence not only in the dependent variable water quality but also in the explanatory variables we may then expand the baseline model using a general specification for static spatial panel models to include these effects as shown in equation 2 2 y i t τ n α i λ w i j y j x i t β θ w i j x i t ξ i ψ t μ i t μ i t ρ w i j μ i t ε i t ε i t n 0 σ 2 i 1 n t 1 t where y is the vector for the dependent variable for each unit of the sample i 1 n τ n is the n k vector of ones for the constant term α and β and θ are the k 1 vector of parameters associated with the n k matrix of explanatory variables and the spatially explicit explanatory variables respectively these explanatory variables include the natural logged ln values of gdp lngdp the squared and cubed values of this natural log lngdp 2 2 austria belgium cyprus czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg netherlands poland slovakia spain sweden and united kingdom and lngdp 3 3 for example data on oxygen content for hungary was available for 1987 2007 which is a long time period however data before 1998 was available for few other countries hence hungary was excluded from the analysis due to the lack of data for recent years and difficulties to match the time series with the other countries as another example oxygen data for portugal were only available for 2006 2012 motivating exclusion of portugal in the analysis the logged values of population density lnpopdens and livestock density livedens governance indicators govind trade openness trade as well as openness to foreign direct investment fdi the variables ρ and λ denote the spatial autoregressive or lag and the spatial autocorrelation coefficients respectively the parameters ξ i and ψ denote the spatial specific and time fixed effects finally ε denotes a vector of disturbance terms such that ε ε 1 ε n t where ε i is assumed to be independently and identically distributed for all i with a mean of zero and a variance of σ 2 using the spatial weight matrices detailed in section 3 1 we run the classical langrage multiplier lm anselin 1988 and the robust lm rlm anselin et al 1996 tests on the residuals of the estimated ols model these tests indicate if we can reject the ols specification in favour of the spatial error sem or spatial lag sar model if we reject the ols model in favour of both the sem and sar models this suggests that a spatial durbin model is appropriate these results are detailed within section 4 2 given the tests for econometric model selection we can write the spatial lag model i e where θ 0 ρ 0 in equation 3 as 3 y i t λ w i j y j t x i t β ξ i ε i t t 1 t all variables are as previously defined the spatial autoregressive coefficient is given by λ to which a statistically significant result would indicate a sizeable intensity of spatial interdependency including the explanatory variables contained in the

the real gdp per capita range to which water quality would begin to improve 3 3 data description our dependent variable for water quality is given through the measure of the oxygen content within bodies of water the oxygen content is one of the major indicators used to evaluate ecological status according to the wfd 3 if the oxygen level is too low this can affect the composition of aquatic species communities and reduce fish stocks hence the oxygen level is crucial for the delivery of surface water ecosystem services the oxygen content is determined by natural conditions as well human activities causing nutrient emissions from point and nonpoint sources and soil erosion the wfd also considers additional water quality indicators such as phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations however oxygen contents data show a considerably better coverage across time and countries compared to the nutrient related measures which motivates our choice to focus on this variable still it can be noted that nutrient levels are negatively related to oxygen levels as nutrient emissions lead to excessive growth of plants and algae which when decaying consume oxygen and therefore cause oxygen deficiency this study constructs a balanced panel data for 20 countries 2 within the european union over the years 1998 2014 where data is on an annual basis the choice of countries to include was determined by the availability of a sufficiently long time series of data including also data for recent years for the dependent variable 3 considering the oxygen content within bodies of surface water oxy 4 4 due to issues of missing data where in total 304 out of 340 observations are given from oxygen content levels linear inter and extrapolation is used in order to conduct spatial analysis a table for data description of the non extrapolated data is provided in supplementary appendix a table sa1 our data are median values measured in mg l and are collected from the european environment agency s eea 45 database waterbase for each country apart from sweden to which data is provided by the mvm database 46 which is constructed by the swedish university of agricultural sciences waterbase contains water quality data which was delivered by the member states countries and cooperating countries 5 5 the countries report these data within the scope of the current wise soe water quality icm wise 6 reporting obligation and the retired wise soe water quality wise 4 river quality ewn 1 lake quality ewn 2 and groundwater quality ewn 3 reporting obligations the purpose of waterbase is to provide indicators for the assessment of state and trends in water quality and to monitor the progress of european policy objectives the fact that the data are regularly used for policy evaluation supports their relevance in our analysis still the dataset has limitations although the eu increasingly demands harmonization of environmental monitoring monitoring schemes could potentially vary across countries for example the frequency of sampling might differ also it could be possible that within a given country some regions are subject to more intensive monitoring than others together this motivates us to use of the median values of the dependent variable across all surface water monitoring stations the median is a more representative measure of the distribution in this situation as the role of outliers is reduced income is measured as real gdp per capita given in constant 2010 us dollars 47 population density popdens is measured by population per square kilometre 48 livestock density livedens is calculated by using total livestock data 49 which we recalculated as livestock units using coefficient provided by eurostat 49 and shown in supplementary appendix table sa2 we then calculated the number of livestock units per square kilometre which was used in the regressions the worldwide governance indicators wgi are provided by the world bank 50 which detail the level of institutional quality in particular they detail four key variables 1 voice and accountability voice 2 government effectiveness goveff 3 regulatory quality reg 4 control of corruption corrup and 5 rule of law law these indicators are measured on a scale from 2 5 weak governance to 2 5 strong governance due to missing data for the years 1999 and 2001 linear interpolation is used to ensure a balanced dataset the indicators are highly correlated with correlation coefficients above 0 8 see supplementary appendix table sa3 the baseline estimations this study therefore uses government effectiveness goveff as a representative for the series of governance indicators finally trade openness trade is measured as the total level of imports and exports of goods and services measured as a percentage of gdp 51 the total level of foreign direct investment fdi is measured as a percentage of gdp 52 a summary of descriptive statistics for each variable discussed can be seen below in table 2 a time trend time is also included given by a series of dummy variables representing each year to remove any potential linear trend caused by the timeline 4 results in this section we first present the tests for spatial dependence in the dependent variable oxygen content secondly the non spatial panel ols model given in equation 1 was used as discussed in section 3 to conduct tests for econometric method selection finally this is followed by an estimation and analysis of results obtained using the spatial lag model slm given in equation 4 4 1 baseline tests for spatial dependence the results of the moran s i and geary s c tests using the constructed the spatial weight matrices for k 1 6 nearest neighbours are seen below in table 3 the results show that for each weight matrix results are significant at the 1 statistical level with a positive value from moran s i test these results are also backed up from the results for geary s c test this indicates that positive spatial autocorrelation is observed between the european countries within the dependent variable which confirms that we may continue to test which spatial econometric method is appropriate 4 2 spatial econometric method selection from the results given below in table 4 we can see that the global moran s i test on the regression residuals in each ols model specification is significant at the 1 statistical level across the different spatial weight matrices an indication of the presence of spatial spillovers the classical lm tests for the spatial error and spatial lag models also show statistical significance for k 2 to 6 nearest neighbours however from results of the robust lm rlm tests we see that the results for the spatial error show no statistical significance the tests for the spatial lag model reveal statistical significance at the 5 level for k 2 to 6 nearest neighbours from these results we may deduce that from the presence of significant spatial dependence in the data it would be inappropriate for the ekc model to be estimated via ols as this may yield biased and inconsistent estimates and that it may be best to estimate a spatial lag model previous literature also contends that possible omitted variable bias affects spatial regression models less than that for ols regression where such effects and spatial dependence are in the spatial lag term for the case of the spatial lag model slm 53 54 4 3 pooled ols regression the results of the pooled ols model is shown in column 1 of table 5 we see that the values for real gdp per capita are statistically significant at the 1 level throughout these results indicate the existence of the ekc showing the expected result of an inverse n shape between oxygen content and real gdp per capita results also show that livestock density and government effectiveness are statistically significant at the 1 level here results suggest that increases in government effectiveness are associated with higher levels in oxygen content whilst increases in livestock density are associated with decreasing levels in oxygen content however given the tests for spatial autocorrelation given in section 4 2 the existence of spatial spillovers is seen within the model which indicate that the non spatial ols estimates may be severely biased and inconsistent thus we continue to estimate the panel spatial lag model via maximum likelihood 4 4 spatial regressions given equation 4 we present the results as shown below in table 5 of the maximum likelihood estimations of the spatial lag model using fixed effects see columns 2 6 firstly we see that lambda which denotes the spatial autocorrelation coefficients is significant at the 1 level with a positive value this indicates that there exist significant spatial spillovers within the model overall we may see that the total effect of our independent variables may not only have direct consequences within a given country s own water quality but also through indirect consequences on other countries through spatial spillovers the estimates from the slm model cannot be interpreted as partial derivatives in the typical regression model fashion 55 in order to obtain the correct signs and magnitudes of the coefficients it is necessary to conduct an impact analysis as outlined by lesage and pace 44 where we also obtain the direct indirect and total impacts which detail the effects from home from neighbours and the total impact respectively these results are shown below in table 6 considering the total impacts results show that gdp per capita including the squared and cubic values are consistently significant at the 1 level this displays an ekc relationship with the expected signs and inverted n shape results also show that livestock density livedens is significant at the 1 level throughout government effectiveness goveff is also significant at the 1 and 5 level for k 1 and k 2 6 neighbours respectively trade lntrade is also significant at the 10 level for k 4 6 neighbours finally significance is observed at the 10 level for the time trend time results not shown for k 4 6 neighbours for the results of lntrade and time as these results are not consistent throughout this implies a less than robust outcome the results imply that with a positive sign for goveff and lntrade countries with a higher level of government effectiveness and trade openness are associated with higher oxygen content levels with a negative sign observed for livedens this suggests that an increase in livestock density is associated with lower oxygen content levels an interesting observation is that the indirect impacts neighborhood effects are consistently lower in magnitude than the direct impacts apart from when six neighbours are considered this implies that the impacts domestically are higher than those from neighbouring countries comparing these results to that from the ols estimation it appears that the coefficient estimates from the latter assuming independent observations may display substantial bias we see this as results for trade and the time trend were not significant in the ols regression but are significant within the spatial model however neither the spatial nor the ols models show statistical significance for population density and fdi following the approach by plassman and khanna 2007 for calculating the turning points from a cubic function using the total impacts we obtain the point to which oxygen content begins to improve and the point to which oxygen content begins to worsen again given the level of real gdp per capita the results show that the first turning point is within the range of 22 749 and 27 246 usd we find that the second turning point to which oxygen content begins to fall is within the range of 35 686 and 40 311 usd as shown in table 2 we see that the current average real gdp per capita 27 481 usd is just greater than the initial turning point range but less than the second turning point calculated this would suggest that on average the current economic development within europe is associated with increases in oxygen content hence improved water quality considering individual countries table a1 in the appendix we take the average real gdp per capita values given in thousands of usd across two periods period 1 1998 2005 and period 2 2006 2014 from these results we see that most countries considered fall between each turning point range however the czech republic estonia latvia lithuania poland and slovakia are below the first turning point across both periods indicating that economic development can imply a decrease in water quality 6 6 in this context it can be relevant to note that one could intuitively expect that water quality would be lower in the east european countries for example because of the history of large overuse of fertilizers in the agricultural sector during the soviet era until the 1990 in spite of such expectations upwards trends in nutrient concentrations were found after the soviet era when using in long term monitoring data in estonia and latvia 56 an observation which is consistent with our results the east european countries were further required to undertake substantial changes in their economic and environmental policy institutions as part of the conditions for joining the eu in 2007 the historical and institutional differences between the east european countries and other countries are captured in our analysis through the governance indicators and the country fixed effects also denmark and luxembourg have average real gdp per capita rates that are above the second turning point in both periods which indicate that their economic development in the two periods has been high enough to be associated with declines in water quality we also see from the results that cyprus and spain in period 1 has an average gdp rate below the first turning point but a value in period 2 within the turning point ranges this indicates that their economic development has improved across time to be consistent with a change from decreases to increases in oxygen content 4 5 robustness checks for robustness two other estimations were conducted with the first including only real gdp per capita as a predictor of water oxygen content the second estimation includes also the variables for population and livestock density popdens and livedens for these results were consistent with the values given in the estimation provided in table 5 with very similar levels in the spatial autoregressive coefficient as well the results are not shown here for reasons of brevity and space we also tested the result of including all governance indicator variables instead of one representative variable as done in the main results section the results for the income variable are seen in the appendix table a2 and the full results can be found in the supplementary appendix table sa4 we observe that the results are largely the same at the expected sign and with similar impacts from gdp per capita livestock density and trade openness 7 7 only gdp results are shown to conserve space for full results see table sa4 in the supplementary appendix from the results of the governance indicators we see statistical significance with a positive value for government effectiveness goveff as well as voice and accountability voice significance is also observed for regulatory quality but with a negative coefficient however due to the level of correlation between these variables including all five together produces a result that would be heavily biased and may produce inconsistent outcomes we also tested alternate specifications of the spatial weighting matrix considering other spatial relationships than the number of nearest neighbours first we considered the distance between centroids within the spatial matrix i e 200 km 400 km etc doing this we find that the results were very similar to the results given above and did not change conclusions for the sake of brevity the results are not shown here in the case of water quality the physical spillovers of pollutants between different spatial units can be expected to depend on whether they are located upstream or downstream and whether they share common water bodies such as international rivers to account for the role of such physical spillovers in water quality we proceeded as follows first we constructed different spatial weight matrices to capture this physical relationship as closely as possible for this purpose we used geospatial information maps from the water information system for europe wise of the wfd reference database for 2016 the latest available version this data is reported to the european commission under the wfd reporting requirement on member countries we then combined geodata on river basin districts and surface water body shapefiles to determine countries that share a common water body a river basin district covers an area of land and sea consisting of one or more neighbouring river basins along with associated coastal waters surface water body geo information on the other hand is defined as a body of surface water with significant element of water surface like a lake river stream or a transnational waterbody or coastal water 8 8 https www eea europa eu data and maps data wise wfd protected areas 1 based on the above information we first constructed a symmetric spatial weight matrix where w i j 1 if two or more countries share a common waterbody and w i j 0 otherwise we do not distinguish between upstream and downstream countries in this specification we call this matrix a symmetric contiguous spatial weight matrix see refs 57 58 a second matrix is created by also accounting for the physical elevation of each country average elevation values are compared between neighbour s who share a common waterbody to determine upstream versus downstream states a country with a higher elevation value to its neighbour s with a shared waterbody is considered to be an upstream candidate with its river potentially flowing downstream to its neighbour s in this case the weight for an upstream state is assigned the value w i j 1 as a neighbour to the downstream states the reverse cannot hold for the downstream state s in relation to its upstream neighbour s for which w i j 0 thus resulting in an asymmetric contiguous spatial weight matrix for example given the elevation of austria 910 m compared to the czech republic 91 m and germany 263 m who are contiguous in relation to a shared waterbody we assume austria to be an upstream neighbour to czech republic and germany similarly germany is assumed to be an upstream neighbour to netherlands 30 m and denmark 34 m while this approach is arguably a simplification it does to some degree account for the transboundary nature of water pollution considered in this study 9 9 for example this weight matrix does not take into account the location of watershed boundaries within a country which affect the water flows from one country to another however it should be noted that the physical impact of one country on water quality in another cannot be determined only by taking the size of common watersheds into account another factors that also matters as the size of runoff and water flows to our knowledge there is no data on the magnitude of the actual transports of water pollutants between countries across europe moreover there are many cases where the upstream and downstream relationships between countries is unclear including for example lakes and rivers located on the border between two countries and coastal areas in the neighborhood of a country border for the two constructed weight matrices we row standardize them following standard practice in applied spatial econometrics literature the third and final weight matrix developed to reflect physical spillovers uses the preceding asymmetric matrix but in this case we assign a bigger weight to the impact of upstream countries on their downstream neighbour s 1 compared to that of downstream countries on their upstream neighbour s 0 5 the intuition is that the downstream neighbours are more exposed to the negative water pollution externality from upstream neighbours than the opposite 57 although the process of assigning the weight is ad hoc following takahashi et al 57 this approach reflects the possibility of mutual physical impacts also in the case where an upstream downstream relationship could be expected to dominate all three weight matrixes for physical spillovers can be found in table sa4 in the supplementary appendix using the three different constructed spatial weight matrices above we re estimated the baseline sar model as another check of sensitivity of the results the results for both the first stage estimates and associated marginal impacts for income are shown in table a3 in the appendix overall the results are comparable to those from the slm model evidently we still observe a significant inverted n shaped ekc relationship as in the baseline this observation is robust even if we control for all the governance indicators table a4 in the appendix the only noticeable difference between these results and the baseline estimates lie with the spatial interaction parameter λ which changes direction to negative furthermore we compare the baseline results with those from alternative spatial panel models such as the spatial error model sem spatial autoregressive model with autocorrelated errors sac and the spatial durbin model sdm the sdm allowed us to properly account for spatial interaction in the governance indicators by including additional spatially weighted covariates to capture potential spillovers of these indicators on neighbouring states water quality in all these models we utilize the same three spatial weight matrices reflecting physical spillovers constructed for the preceding robustness check most important our conclusion regarding the ekc relation still holds irrespective of the model see table sa6 and sa7 in the supplementary appendix the results further imply that improved government effectiveness goveff in a neighbouring country is significantly associated with higher water oxygen content levels in the domestic country column 8 in table sa5 supplementary appendix however when we incorporate all the government indices in the respective sdm models the evidence is less satisfactory but the ekc results still hold in that case we find that only that the rule of law law and regulatory quality reg in neighbouring states improves water quality in own jurisdiction 10 10 results are available on request baseline results are finally compared with the case where none of the variables are log transformed while the results on the ekc curvature are qualitatively consistent with the baseline findings the magnitudes are less informative in terms of interpretation table sa8 in supplementary appendix the near zero coefficient estimates especially of the income variables might be due to scaling problems this makes the log transformed specification more preferable which is a feature extant in the ekc literature 5 discussion and conclusions the purpose of this study was to estimate the relationship between real gdp per capita and water quality proxied by oxygen content levels within europe using a spatial panel approach with a cubic function for national income furthermore this study also addresses criticisms of the traditional ekc approaches through use of a cubic function and addition of institutional quality and market openness variables results show a strong significant relationship between oxygen content and income with the expected inverted n shape which shows an ekc relationship from estimated turning points of 22 749 to 27 246 usd for the initial turning point and 35 686 to 40 311 usd for the second turning point furthermore our initial turning point range is similar of that by gassebner et al 8 26 800 usd while it is below that given by lee et al 5 38 220 usd both our estimated turning points are considerably less than those estimated by farzin and grogan 9 the two former study bod levels which are related to oxygen contents whereas the latter considered ammonia and fecal coliform bacteria which can explain the difference in results we can then gather that the current average real gdp per capita within europe falls within the bounds estimated in this paper therefore one would be inclined to assume that on average economic development within europe should be expected to lead to improved water quality however our results also show that this may not necessarily be the case the reason is that a considerable number of countries have either a too low or too high income per capita to be in the range where economic development is associated water quality improvements this observation tends to support results in torras and boyce 1998 and rupasingha et al 16 suggesting that income inequality is associated with a worsening of water quality torras and boyce 1998 argue that this could be motivated by a more equitable distribution of power contributing positively to environmental quality by enhancing the influence on policy of those who bear the costs of pollution relative to the influence of those who benefit from pollution generating activities however this explanation would not apply in our case where we have inequality between countries rather than within the same jurisdiction instead our results offer a different explanation for the negative relationship between income inequality and water quality namely the existence of an inverted n shaped ekc this raises a concern regarding how eu countries that fall outside the ranges of sustainable economic development can achieve their water quality targets secondly spatial autocorrelation is significant throughout our analysis displaying that spatial spillovers related to environmental and institutional factors between countries are an important feature in ekc analysis thus inclusion of spatial effects in the analysis is necessary to avoid biased estimates this is consistent with previous literature emphasizing the importance for such analysis 20 21 as well as empirical analysis considering the linkage between explanatory variables and water quality 9 significance of spatial spillovers did not decrease when considering additional nearest neighbours contradicting findings from ref 59 that spillovers are constrained by national borders with immediate neighbours furthermore with direct effects being consistently of a larger magnitude than indirect effects within the impact analyses this would infer to us that the domestic effects are larger than that from neighbouring countries whereas our baseline estimations which account for the general spatial impact of the nearest neighbours show significant and positive spatial spillovers the spatial spillovers are significant and negative when using different spatial matrices specifically reflecting shared water bodies and the upstream downstream nature of the physical pollutant spillovers although our conclusions on the impact of our explanatory variables are robust to the choice of spatial matrix this implies that we cannot draw any strong conclusions on the nature and drivers of the spatial effects negative spatial interactions are sometimes interpreted as being a consequence of strategic environmental policymaking where countries could choose to apply lax regulation in order to attract investments 60 fredriksson and millimet 2003 61 millimet and roy 2010 however it is not evident that such an interpretation is relevant in this case given the positive spatial interaction in the baseline model instead the negative spatial effects when using the physical spillover matrices could potentially be due to the limited number of non zero values in the spatial weight matrices ultimately explained by the exclusion of several countries due to lack of data for the dependent variable another potential explanation could be that economic activities impacting water quality are non uniformly distributed within countries for example an upstream country could have high water quality in large parts of its territory but polluting activity could be located close to the border to downstream countries which might generate the observed outcome hence future research including additional countries would be valuable to further examine the magnitude of physical spillover effects however the baseline model allows us to capture both physical economic and institutional spillovers and indicates that the sum of those together exert a positive spillover effect between countries the results show that increased livestock density is associated with lower levels of water quality this fits in with findings by e g ephraim et al 62 and wen et al 19 although higher livestock density could be associated by pointification of nonpoint emissions allowing for more efficient nutrient mitigation techniques this is not sufficient to offset the negative impact of livestock on water quality results show that increased population density has no significance which contradicts findings in the literature 7 27 28 63 our results on the representative indicator for the five governance indicators government effectiveness was significant with a positive sign this stands in line to assertions by previous literature sources 18 23 neef 64 and brown 34 criticizes analysis using national governance indices where such variables ignore the differences between national and local governance this is argued to be problematic as national policy may either not reflect resistance from local communities asymmetry of knowledge or may understate potential benefits of devolved decision making future studies may look to assess the relative importance of local and national governance given the importance of local decisions for water quality 29 65 our results also show that openness to trade has a significant effect in the positive direction this result fits in with findings by aklin 36 and fang et al 2018 as well as previous literature on water quality in the ekc context 7 8 together these results suggest that strengthening of governance and increased economic openness could potentially help remediating water quality problems a limitation of this study is the limited time dimension of the dataset which precludes analysis of the impact of common eu policies specifically targeting water pollution such as the nitrate and wastewater directives on water quality within the union furthermore missing data

8673,small scale agriculture is one of the fundamental economic sectors in chile an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change suggest a higher weather risk for the future with potential consequences for crop choices these effects are expected to be greater in dryland areas where producers are more vulnerable to shocks and therefore less able to protect themselves against these risks using data from the 7th chilean national agriculture and forestry census we explore small scale farmers cropland decisions as an adaptation strategy to cope with droughts we use remote sensing data to identify drought events and model the impact of droughts on farmers decisions using a multivariate fractional model this model assumes that farmers allocate shares of land over a crop portfolio our findings show that farmers in dryland areas reduce high risk cropping activities after recent drought shocks choosing crops with shorter growing periods and lower capital and technological costs such as cereals however we found a different cropland pattern in areas with a higher frequency of droughts in these locations farmers prefer legumes and tubers vineyards fruits and vegetables finally maize and vineyards are more likely to be grown in places with higher temperatures results suggest potential crop adaptation strategies in the face of more arid environments in the future keywords land allocation risk drought shocks multivariate fractional logit model jel classification c23 c25 d81 q12 o13 q15 1 introduction in recent decades the chilean agricultural sector has developed following a strategy based on the integration in the international markets alongside the international role of chilean agriculture small scale agriculture is the primary income generating source for the local rural population according to the national institute for agricultural development indap this group controls 85 of the country s farms and generates 60 000 direct and indirect jobs with 1 2 million people depending on this activity for livelihood 19 1 1 small scale farmers in chile are named family farmers and are officially classified as those who hold 12 or fewer hectares of basic irrigation hbi echenique and romero 2009 chile is frequently affected by climatological hydrological and geological disasters such as drought wildfire floods landslides and earthquakes among others cnid 2016 onemi 2016 amid changes due to climate change hydro climatological shocks in particular droughts have been quite recurrent in the last decades 1 since 2010 chile has incurred one of the most severe droughts in its history and studies that estimate increases in temperature and declines in precipitation predict an even higher drought risk for the future 2 4 these changes will have important consequences on farmers productivity and the rural landscape 5 climate change is not only expected to affect the productivity of crops but also to generate an ex ante effect on the allocation of useable land because the occurrence of traumatic events in the past has the potential to shape individuals decisions in the future 6 the history of catastrophic events experienced by producers could determine their background risk 7 consequently an increase in the frequency and magnitude of weather shocks projected for the future may have significant consequences on crop choice portfolios these effects are expected to be larger in dryland areas where producers are more vulnerable to shocks and therefore less able to protect themselves against these risks farmers in dryland areas rely almost completely on seasonal rainfall for their agricultural activities the lack of irrigation or stored water in combination with high levels of erosion limits crop production even under normal climate conditions 8 ciren 2010 land allocation decisions are expected to be mediated by producers background risk changes in decisions may also be driven by the occurrence of short run weather shocks in the form of severe drought events the aim of this study is to empirically analyze the effect of long term climate variables and recent extreme drought events on cropland decisions as an adaptation mechanism by small scale farmers in dryland areas in chile we use individual and commune level data from the 7th chilean national agriculture and forestry census 9 to identify crop choices as well as long term climate data to calculate average temperature and precipitation and identify drought related shocks and their historical frequency several studies have discussed how climate relates to agriculture and food security from an economic point of view some of these studies have used the general equilibrium approach 2 2 this approach uses computable general equilibrium cge methods to simulate the equilibrium theory formalized by arrow and debreu 1954 see e g refs 10 11 other studies have used the ricardian approach 3 3 these studies discuss how climate e g temperature and precipitation and geographic variables e g soil quality affect farmers revenue and land value see e g refs 12 14 mendelsohn et al 2010 15 16 and others have tried to understand farmers adaptation to the climate 4 4 these studies use choice models to try to understand how farmers adapt to the climate see e g refs 17 25 this paper contributes to the literature in three main aspects first the identification of droughts relies on the use of spatial climate data which can be more accurate than standard records and allow analyzing the effect of historical events this information could in turn determine producers background risk to severe droughts second unlike other studies the empirical strategy allows us to simultaneously model the proportion of land that is devoted to each crop category mullahy 2012 third it provides evidence about farmers approaches to adaptation in the context of an emerging economy chile offers an interesting setting to study the impact of weather events on the one hand the country has an extensive history of extreme weather events because of el niño and la niña phenomena on the other hand extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency as global temperatures rise 26 this study is divided into the following sections section 2 describes the agricultural sector and climate in chile section 3 characterizes crop farming as an adaptation strategy to climate change sections 4 and 5 present the econometric model and data respectively section 6 discusses the main results section 7 evaluates a set of robustness checks section 8 summarizes the main findings and section 9 discusses the policy implications of the study 2 agriculture and climate in chile according to the 27 the chilean agricultural sector represents around 5 of the county s gross domestic product gdp and contributes to 10 of national employment more than 50 of its production is sold in international markets some major agricultural products include fruits grapes apples pears peaches and berries horticulture garlic onions and asparagus and cereal and tubers wheat maize and potatoes in terms of socioeconomic and cultural factors 73 4 of farmers have farms that are smaller than 20 ha 28 most farmers are male and have not finished primary school as for small scale farmers this sector represents one third of the agricultural gross domestic product agdp and contributes to 1 2 of the chilean gdp moreover this sector provides around 60 of the food consumed in domestic markets and controls 85 of total farms in the country 29 according to ine 2007 around 55 of farmland under small scale agriculture was not irrigated at the time of the study this can be due to farmers being located in dryland areas or lacking irrigation technology despite having potential access to water 30 a relatively larger increase in modern irrigation adoption has been observed among larger farmers 2 climate change is expected to affect dryland agriculture more greatly than irrigated agriculture because of its interaction with the changes in temperature and water availability 31 chile has a great deal of climatic diversity cities located in the north have on average less precipitation and higher temperatures compared to those located in the south according to vicuña et al 2013 temperatures in chile have increased considerably and precipitation events have substantially decreased in magnitude and frequency during the last four decades this can also be seen in figs 1 and 2 which show that communal temperatures in the period 2002 2006 have increased compared with the period 1950 1954 conversely average precipitation has decreased during the same period chilean climate is also affected by el niño southern oscillation enso an ocean atmosphere phenomenon associated with changes in precipitation although we do not intend on studying enso s effect on farmers decisions this phenomenon can be related to the presence of droughts and floods see e g ref 32 thus this phenomenon may affect the chilean agricultural sector 33 as well as the national gdp 34 and its effects are expected to increase in frequency 26 3 crop farming and weather risk catastrophic risks such as droughts can have a cumulative effect on individuals decisions and behavior 6 they can also increase individuals risk vulnerability and as suggested by ref 7 increase farmers background risk this effect may induce individuals to undertake less risky activities creating ex ante effects on farmers crop allocation decisions a similar behavior is expected to occur in response to more contemporaneous weather risks which arise in response to past realization of weather related shocks 24 these shocks could also have the potential to affect contemporaneous crop allocation decisions with more recent events expected to greatly affect producers allocation decisions when compared with events taking place further apart adaptation can be considered a response to risks associated with environmental hazards or human vulnerability 35 one of the typical ways to deal with risks is by using insurance however the uptake of climate farm insurance is rather low salazar et al 2019 which means that farmers are more likely to rely on their own crop choices as a risk mitigation mechanism there are two strands of literature devoted to farmers land allocation decisions the first group of literature comes from the area of agricultural production this literature suggests that producers crop choices are determined by the availability or lack of key production inputs such as irrigation and by farm characteristics such as land tenure and scale of production 36 37 these studies also indicate that crop choice and crop diversity not only respond to changes in relative prices of crops and fertilizers 37 but also to consumption price risk kurosaki and fafchamps 2002 38 find that farmers choose a crop mix characterized by greater crop diversity if diversity is positively related to productivity and negatively correlated with production and income variability these authors also evidence that risk averse farmers cope with the uncertainty they face by allocating land to different crop species 39 the second group of literature is devoted to analyzing the effect of climate change background risk and short run weather events on farmers decisions this literature suggests that farmers may adapt to catastrophic risks by choosing low risk cropping activities instead of those with higher risks in response to background risk 7 from an agronomic perspective during a drought farmers may prefer crop categories that have shorter growing periods and therefore lower water requirements 5 5 technical water requirements for growing a particular crop are given by crop coefficient kc criteria described by allen et al 1998 this situation explains why farmers also react to short run extreme weather events by changing the amount of land devoted to specific crops 40 conduct a systematic revision of the available approaches to understand how individuals adapt to climate this revision suggests two main strands of literature 1 adaptation to long term changes in mean climate and 2 adaptation to short run changes in weather which can be understood as drivers of the variance of climate the first strand of literature has mainly relied on cross sectional and simulation analysis of changes in climate see e g refs 10 15 18 20 41 42 for instance ref 19 evaluate how south american farmers adapt to climate by changing their crops by analyzing how the land allocated to the seven most popular crops in the region maize potato rice soybean squash and wheat responds to changes in temperature and precipitation results show that farmers who work in colder regions are more likely to choose potatoes and wheat while those working in regions with higher average temperatures tend to choose maize soybeans and rice farmers in warm locations choose fruits and vegetables and squash similar studies were conducted in africa 18 and china 20 with similar results according to ref 40 this evidence indicates that farmers adapt by changing their crop choices as the climate warms suggesting that adaptation could have the potential to ameliorate damages attributable to climate change the second strand of literature relies primarily on panel data analysis exploiting intertemporal variation in weather and the subsequent effects of weather shocks on individuals decisions see e g refs 16 17 21 25 43 for instance ref 24 study how farmers in mozambique shifted land use patterns after weather shocks concluding that crop choices are sensitive to recent weather shocks and that the farmers are more responsive to more severe droughts they also find that farmers tend to relocate farms from high risk to lower risk cropping activities according to ref 40 evidence from this literature sheds light on the difficulty of adapting to weather shocks and the subsequent lack of effectiveness in counteracting damages from weather shocks consequently producers and society as a whole will most likely to remain vulnerable to climate variance 4 empirical strategy to analyze the effect of long term climate variables and recent extreme drought events on farmers cropland decisions we propose estimating a multivariate fractional model 44 we consider a population of i 1 n farmers the variable of interest is 0 y i k 1 which represents the share of cropland for the k th crop category k 1 m for the i th individual this is 1 e y i k x i r i z i t 1 g x i β k r i δ k z i t 1 γ k 0 1 k 1 m 2 m 1 m e y i k x i r i z i t 1 1 where x i represents the vector of the producer s household s and farm s physical characteristics r i includes long term climate variables i e average temperature and precipitation historical droughts and z i t 1 represents the vector of immediate past weather characteristics i e droughts the coefficients β δ and γ are the parameters to be estimated g represents the linking function which in this case corresponds to the logistic function λ thus the conditional mean of our empirical model is 3 e y i k x i r i z i t 1 e x p x i β k r i δ k z i t 1 γ k m 1 m e x p x i β k r i δ k z i t 1 γ k k 1 m 44 suggests the estimation procedure proposed by ref 45 this is a quasi maximum likelihood method qml which relies on the bernoulli log likelihood function q 4 q β γ i 1 n m 1 m e y i k x i r i z i t 1 y i m which is maximized to obtain the qml estimator 5 j β γ l o g q β γ i 1 n m 1 m y i m l o g e y i k x i r i z i t 1 then the marginal effects are obtained by 6 p e i m k e y i m x i r i z i t 1 x i k r i z ik 5 data this study uses data from the 7th chilean national agriculture and forestry census this is the main source of data on the current state of agricultural and forestry resources and the rural population in chile this census was conducted in 2007 with 2006 being the reference period the observational unit is at the farmer level covering approximately 256 711 agricultural producers spread across the whole country 9 6 6 because we only observe single year individual observations our empirical analysis is based on cross sectional data although there was a previous attempt at gathering a previous round of the census from 1997 being year 1996 the reference period this information was aggregated at the commune level this situation prevented us from conducting a panel data analysis while still exploiting individual heterogeneity of producers for policy interventions the ministry of agriculture defines small farmers within the framework of family farmers as those holding 12 ha or less of basic irrigation hbi fao 2009 we follow this definition in this paper similarly we define dryland agriculture as either areas without access to water or areas with the potential for irrigation that cannot be fully exploited by producers 7 7 the national census allows to identify some crop categories that are grown in areas without access to water secano or dry areas these categories can be fully identified from the data and include cereals legume and tubers industrial crops grapevines and seed crops however there are other crop categories fruits and vegetables for which this information is not disaggregated in such cases we define a crop as being grown in dryland areas when it is produced in the absence of irrigation for this analysis crops that are grown in either condition are regarded as dryland agriculture the census information is combined with climate remote sensing data e g temperature and precipitation obtained from the east anglia climatic research university cru and the global spei database 5 1 sociodemographic and agricultural data the 7th national agriculture and forestry census 9 reports surveyed data aggregated at the farmer level it provides information on farmers socio demographic and productive characteristics such as land distribution input use use of credit among others notice that at the moment of this study this is the only and most current available public data that is representative of chilean agriculture because of chilean geographical conditions most farms are located in central south chile the northern and southern extremes of the country were excluded from the census 8 8 because of their extreme weather conditions and geographic characteristics regions located in extreme areas of chile i e northern and southern regions are regarded as natural handicaps and agricultural activities cannot take place consequently these areas are excluded from the census to construct the dependent variables and following the census data we begin by classifying the farmer production portfolio into eight crop categories cereals cerp legume and tubers ltor industrial crops cindu grapevines or vineyards vinpl fruits frut seed crops cseed vegetables 9 9 this category includes vegetables and flowers vegt and land under a set aside scheme barb subsequently we consider a more disaggregated classification covering the three most important crops in chilean agriculture wheat potatoes and maize control variables at the producer and farm levels include gender age education total number of plots total area of useable land wheat yield per hectare 10 10 this variable is measured by quintal per hectare or 100 kg per hectare the inclusion of wheat economic conditions responds to the assumption that farmers have a status quo crop from which they decide to move out if incentives are attractive enough in chilean agriculture wheat is the most important crop and it can grow in diverse agro ecological conditions across the national territory thus wheat can be considered as the status quo in the sense that farmers will move in or out of this production to other alternatives depending on changes in its economic incentives price of wheat powder 11 11 price information varying spatially is available from the office of studies and agrarian policies odepa starting in 2014 we use the consumer price index cpi to correct for inflation water access at the farm level 12 12 this a dummy variable takes a value of 1 if the farmer reports having access to water and zero otherwise the options for water sources are wells springs rivers streams seasonally regulated reservoirs yearly regulated reservoirs lakes lagoons and others a measure of soil erosion at the commune level 13 13 soil quality was proxied using information on soil erosion ciren 2010 the measure of erosion integrates a set of soil topographic climatic and biological characteristics thus erosion will be more severe to the extent that soils are more porous and sandier and that fields are more sloped and hold less vegetation as well as in locations where a large amount of rain falls in a short time we use the percentage of agricultural land with some degree of erosion hectares and a set of dummy variables indicating the use of technology 14 14 certified seeds biologic pest control organic farming and fertirrigation credit 15 15 bank credit agrarian development institute indap credit or other governmental support 16 16 sirsd degraded soil program prochile fpea law n 18 450 irrigation and law no 19 561 and any other type of support such as subsidized insurance 17 17 indap gtt corfo fia bpa pabco sence and crop insurance as well as participation in a farm association finally there is a set of dummy variables denoting the country s macro zones to proxy for geographical characteristics i e north center center south and south a summary of control variables is depicted in table 1 5 2 geo spatial and biophysical data for drought identification we use the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei this drought index proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 can be used as an alternative to other drought indexes such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi 18 18 based on the soil water balance 46 and the standardized precipitation index spi 19 19 based on the probability of precipitation 47 as it combines features from both for this study we use the spei dataset version 2 5 from which we selected the period that covers the time of year when crops require more water for their physiological growth across chile to capture the effects of drought events we generate dummy variables indicating the presence of a shock of this sort in the past 20 20 because of the cross sectional nature of our data these variables should not be understood as lagged variables of the covariates of interest our rationale is that although these events have taken place in the past they have the potential to affect crop allocation in our reference period we are particularly interested in assessing the effect of weather shocks occurring in periods t 1 and t 2 respectively therefore we define a shock occurring in t 1 as the presence of severe droughts during the period september 2005 february 2006 i e based on the spei 6 months similarly a shock occurring in period t 2 is defined as the presence of severe droughts during the period september 2004 february 2005 i e based on the spei 6 months these periods correspond to the spring summer season in the country which are relevant for planting decisions these variables are intended to capture short term effects of recent weather events on crop choices we also use the spei 12 months for february from 1950 to 2006 to create a historical record of the number of severe drought events occurring in that period this information is intended to capture the background risk of the droughts for a given commune we use spei scores to construct the dummy variables used in our analysis these variables take the value of 1 if the spei scores indicate moderate and or severe extreme droughts and 0 otherwise the spei reference values used to identify drought events are displayed in table 2 fig 3 displays the areas affected by the droughts during the reference periods long term climate variables including monthly precipitation and temperatures were obtained from the cru ts 3 24 dataset as with drought temperature and precipitation were transformed to communal data and correspond to annual average temperature c and precipitations mm from 1970 to 2007 with this data we intend to capture the long term effect of climate on crop choice see table 3 6 results 6 1 small scale farming in dryland area baseline model we start with a model that estimates the long term effects of climate on land allocation this includes only average temperature and precipitations from the last 38 years and the frequency of droughts estimated coefficients are shown in tables 4 and 5 we then include short term effects on land use choice by adding lagging drought variables we tested different lags separately estimated coefficients are presented in tables 6 and 7 cereal is considered as baseline in all estimations thereby a positive sign of coefficients mean that farmers are moving away from cereals and increasing land in the corresponding crop category in contrast a negative coefficient can be interpreted as farmers devoting more land to cereal relative to the corresponding crop category marginal effects for the cereal category are shown in table 9 we begin by discussing results regarding long term climate variables climate patterns outlined in figs 1 and 2 suggest that farmers will continue growing crops in the face of higher temperatures and lower precipitations i e in higher drought risk thus it is expected that farmers adapt in some way to these new climate conditions by including the average temperature and precipitation as well as a measure of historical droughts affecting cropland allocation we intend to capture the level of background risk of each farmer with this information we can shed light on the expected long term patterns of crop reallocation results reveal that farmers exposed to higher temperature grow mostly cereals and are more likely to plant vineyards more land dedicated to vineyards in places with higher temperatures may respond to evidence that certain water stress levels may have a positive influence on the quality of grapevines this finding is in line with current predictions in chile that vineyards are likely to move south as temperatures rise in cooler places in locations with higher average precipitations we find that farmers are more likely to reduce land for cereals increasing land for vineyards fruits industrial crops legumes tubers and vegetables results also show that the proportion of land left uncultivated is lower in places with more rainfall and higher temperature these weather conditions may be seen beneficial for agricultural production in sum where higher temperatures and lower levels of precipitations are expected long term our estimations suggest that farmers are likely to adapt by devoting a larger fraction of agricultural land to cereals and vineyards however a scenario with less rainfall can also be harmful for vineyard farming results also suggest that farmers operating in high drought risk areas are adapting to these conditions by planting more vineyards legumes tubers and vegetables while more vineyards in high drought risk areas can be explained by the benefits of exposing wine grapes to drier conditions more land for vegetables can be the result of the great variety of species and planting periods that these crops can support such adaptation responses are also outlined by ref 22 the increased share of agricultural land devoted to horticulture could also be explained by the possibility of cultivating vegetables near urban areas where there is access to tap water finally the short and flexible farming cycle of potatoes and their ability to grow in poor growing conditions may explain a larger area for legumes and tubers in high drought risk areas our results indicate that small scale farmers in dryland areas react to recent past climate events their response however depends on the timing of drought shocks farmers located in zones experiencing a drought shock in t 1 devote more land to cereals moving away from vineyards industrial and seed crops an increase in cereals may be linked to lower technological and capital requirements of these specific crops compared to other crop categories drought shocks occurring in t 2 reveal a reverse in the crop allocation pattern confirming that farmers react to recent drought in the short term from marginal effect estimations see table 9 results show that farmers reduce the land share devoted to cereals after a drought in t 2 which may reflect a re adjustment of their buffer stocks of food crops for consumption that is farmers may have over produced cereals in t 1 to recover a diminished buffer stock by the time climate normalizes in time t farmers may have reduced the land share for cereals to adjust for normal production and consumption needs the same short term dynamic is observed in other crops these findings are in line with 17 who show that land use changes are correlated with both lagged and simultaneous climate variables finally more land left uncultivated after a drought in t 2 may be the result of substantial material losses that farmers have to cover after a drought shock which reduce resources for the coming seasons also droughts can exhaust soil quality affecting its agricultural productive potential for the next agricultural season consequently farmers may temporally decide to move away from the farm and look for off farm income sources 6 2 by crops table 8 presents the estimated coefficients for extended categories of crops including wheat wheat maize maize and potatoes pot wheat is left as the baseline category results do not change when incorporating climate variables sequentially so we only show estimations for the general model table 9 shows the marginal effects of climate variables on wheat land share notice that wheat and maize are cereals while potatoes belong to the legumes and tubers category the remaining crop varieties are regarded as nontraditional cereals ocerp and nontraditional legumes and tubers oltor the other crop categories are also included in the model regarding long term climate variables results confirm that farmers mainly grow cereals and vineyards in places with higher temperatures disaggregating the cereal category shows that wheat and maize are driving these results a positive coefficient for maize suggests that adaptation to higher temperature is occurring more significantly in this crop than in wheat 19 we also find that more rainfall is beneficial for farming vineyards fruits industrial crops and vegetables when disaggregating legumes and tubers crops between potatoes and other crops we find that farmers devote more land to potatoes in places with higher levels of precipitation but that response does not generally hold for other legumes and tuber crops in addition our proxy of background risk for drought shows that farmers are more likely to increase their land share for potatoes this finding suggests that potato farming may be an adaptation strategy in drier conditions which can be explained because potatoes longer roots benefit from humidity over longer periods also potatoes are recognized for being a classic crop for food security having a shorter and more flexible farming cycle as well as the possibility to be left underground to wait for better harvesting conditions thus creating greater resilience to drought in the short term results show that farmers are more likely to increase the share of land allocated to wheat in locations suffering a drought in t 1 reallocating resources away from potatoes and maize farming see table 9 for marginal effects this suggests that the main effect on cereals is driven by wheat given the relevance of the wheat crop for chilean agriculture this result suggests that the consequences of droughts may have substantial effects on national wheat market prices interestingly the short term dynamic previously discussed regarding cereals is also observed in wheat farming and maize but it is inverse in the latter case thus farmers seem to adjust these crop areas after two periods in order to satisfy normal production needs in the case of wheat a well developed wheat milling industry in chile allows farmers to process the whole grains and turn it into flour which makes it possible to store this product for a longer time 7 robustness 7 1 excluding permanent crops while annual crops are produced from plants which last one season permanent crops such as vineyards and fruits are perennial and not replanted after each harvest thus it is not easy to adjust permanent crop land in the short term permanent crops may also have additional expenses in installation and maintenance 48 one of the most plausible explanations for any short term change in these crops relates to how permanent crop farming is carried out and estimated in most cases farmers practice inter cropping meaning that it is unusual for tree crops to be the only cultivated crop in an area consequently any short term change in permanent crop land share probably indicates that farmers are simply modifying intercropping practices to allow for more dynamic responses we remove vineyards and fruit crops from our estimations and leave crops whose planting decisions are made annually estimated coefficients for farmers responses when excluding permanent crops are presented in table a1 the omission of these categories does not fundamentally change the results farmers still move from seed and industrial crops to cereals in zones affected by a drought in t 1 7 2 drought intensity an additional concern with our definition of drought shocks is that it relies on a binary identification of events to explore whether this is important we re estimate our main specification by replacing the binary drought variable with a continuous drought metric lower values in this variable indicate a more severe dry cycle see figure a1 thus a negative effect will indicate an increase in the share of land devoted to a given crop category in response to a higher drought intensity these results are reported in table a2 as before we find that farmers move from fruit industrial seed and vegetable crops to increase the share of land allocated to cereal after a more severe drought event supporting the risk averse behavior discussed previously this may suggest that during periods of more severe water shortage farmers react more strongly by moving a larger share of land to staple crops this behavior can be interpreted as a way to guarantee food security over productivity the negative effect on vineyard area simply reinforces the benefits that drier conditions provide for the quality of wine grapes a reduction in uncultivated areas during high severity droughts suggests that farmers may reallocate part of this fallow land to increase the land area devoted to staples 7 3 accounting for omitted variable bias one of the weakness of the cross sectional data models is their limited ability to control for time trends and time varying characteristics and in dealing with unobserved individual heterogeneity to address some of these issues we use 1997 agricultural census data and estimate a pooled fractional probit pfp for panel data suggested by ref 49 this model accounts for unobserved effects by adding the mean of varying control variables as proposed by chamberlin 1980 it is worth mentioning however that the aggregation level of the 1997 census prevents us from estimating a farmer level regression isolating small scale farmers and dryland conditions as well as accounting for interrelations among crop categories consequently dependent and control variables are aggregated and the model is estimated at the communal level for each crop separately as additional controls we add the share of area under traditional itrad and modern irrigation itec as well as the proportion of land under secure tenancy property right estimated coefficients are presented in table a3 results show that the effects of a drought are stronger two years after the event as the only variable responding to this effect is at t 2 farmers seem to reduce their land share proportion of cereals and increase their land share of the set aside option which is in line with what we described in our baseline model insignificant results at t 1 may be associated with the high level of aggregation of the data leading to a lower number of observations and making the result less comparable to the cross sectional model 7 4 accounting for spatial correlation one further concern is the existence of spatial correlation this is an important issue in agriculture as crop choices are supposed to follow certain spatial patterns we try to deal with spatial correlation in two ways first we clustered our standard errors at the commune level in all our estimations second we present results of estimations of spatial econometric models to incorporate spatial auto correlation or neighborhood effect to feed this kind of model it is crucial to have data on farmer s coordinates to identify their spatial locations unfortunately data on farmers location is confidential and therefore not available as an alternative we collapse our farmer level data into commune level data and estimate a spatial lag model slm and spatial error model sem following similar specifications to the ones outlined in section 7 3 estimations of the slm and sem for each category separately are shown in table a4 and a5 respectively both models suggest some degree of spatial correlation rho and lambda are statistically significant results differ from our baseline model however they tend to follow a similar pattern for recent drought events in cereals farmers are more likely to reduce their land share in the face of a drought in t 2 insignificant coefficients at t 1 do not necessarily mean that our results are not robust to spatial correlation but they may imply new data issues from collapsing farmer data into commune level data 8 conclusions in this study we analyzed the effects of droughts on cropland decisions among small scale farmers in dryland areas in chile using agricultural census data as well as climate remote sensing data we estimated a multivariate fractional logit to model the proportion of land allocated to different crop categories our results show that small scale farmers are sensitive to recent past drought events and farmers responses are larger depending on drought intensity the pattern of reallocation suggests an increase in the share of cereal in dryland environments after a recent drought shock which signals a risk averse behavior this finding suggests that farmers react after a recent drought by choosing crop categories with short growing periods and lower capital costs and technological requirements larger land areas devoted to staple crops during periods of more severe droughts suggest that food security may overcome productivity concerns in this reallocation we also found that crop reallocation to cereals e g wheat seems to follow a short term pattern which may reflect the maintenance of a buffer stock in the farm in terms of background risk and long term responses we found that farmers seem to adapt to their environment they may prefer legumes and tubers vineyards and fruits in high drought risk areas while cereal and industrial crops are preferred in low risk areas moreover maize and vineyards are more likely to be grown in places with higher temperatures findings are robust to the exclusion of perennial crop categories and to the use of a continuous measure of drought intensity 9 policy implications our findings have important implications for the success of government interventions to address concerns of changes in agricultural land due to a more arid environment in the future because climate change is expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of droughts as well as temperature our results shed light on the importance of incorporating background risk in the design of policy measures for adaptation this would require for instance the promotion of extension services cultivation techniques aimed at enhancing productivity by farmers who have already adapted by adopting crops that are more resistant to and even benefit from water stress on the other hand farmers in low risk areas would benefit from longer term policy instruments aimed at supporting farmers in their process of adaptation our results also highlight the importance of targeting soil erosion which is a common problem in areas with high drought probability as we show in this study a significant proportion of the agricultural area in drylands remains uncultivated the lack of vegetation in combination with short term intense rain can lead to increased runoff which would further affect soil quality imposing negative consequences on farmers income credit authorship

8673,small scale agriculture is one of the fundamental economic sectors in chile an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change suggest a higher weather risk for the future with potential consequences for crop choices these effects are expected to be greater in dryland areas where producers are more vulnerable to shocks and therefore less able to protect themselves against these risks using data from the 7th chilean national agriculture and forestry census we explore small scale farmers cropland decisions as an adaptation strategy to cope with droughts we use remote sensing data to identify drought events and model the impact of droughts on farmers decisions using a multivariate fractional model this model assumes that farmers allocate shares of land over a crop portfolio our findings show that farmers in dryland areas reduce high risk cropping activities after recent drought shocks choosing crops with shorter growing periods and lower capital and technological costs such as cereals however we found a different cropland pattern in areas with a higher frequency of droughts in these locations farmers prefer legumes and tubers vineyards fruits and vegetables finally maize and vineyards are more likely to be grown in places with higher temperatures results suggest potential crop adaptation strategies in the face of more arid environments in the future keywords land allocation risk drought shocks multivariate fractional logit model jel classification c23 c25 d81 q12 o13 q15 1 introduction in recent decades the chilean agricultural sector has developed following a strategy based on the integration in the international markets alongside the international role of chilean agriculture small scale agriculture is the primary income generating source for the local rural population according to the national institute for agricultural development indap this group controls 85 of the country s farms and generates 60 000 direct and indirect jobs with 1 2 million people depending on this activity for livelihood 19 1 1 small scale farmers in chile are named family farmers and are officially classified as those who hold 12 or fewer hectares of basic irrigation hbi echenique and romero 2009 chile is frequently affected by climatological hydrological and geological disasters such as drought wildfire floods landslides and earthquakes among others cnid 2016 onemi 2016 amid changes due to climate change hydro climatological shocks in particular droughts have been quite recurrent in the last decades 1 since 2010 chile has incurred one of the most severe droughts in its history and studies that estimate increases in temperature and declines in precipitation predict an even higher drought risk for the future 2 4 these changes will have important consequences on farmers productivity and the rural landscape 5 climate change is not only expected to affect the productivity of crops but also to generate an ex ante effect on the allocation of useable land because the occurrence of traumatic events in the past has the potential to shape individuals decisions in the future 6 the history of catastrophic events experienced by producers could determine their background risk 7 consequently an increase in the frequency and magnitude of weather shocks projected for the future may have significant consequences on crop choice portfolios these effects are expected to be larger in dryland areas where producers are more vulnerable to shocks and therefore less able to protect themselves against these risks farmers in dryland areas rely almost completely on seasonal rainfall for their agricultural activities the lack of irrigation or stored water in combination with high levels of erosion limits crop production even under normal climate conditions 8 ciren 2010 land allocation decisions are expected to be mediated by producers background risk changes in decisions may also be driven by the occurrence of short run weather shocks in the form of severe drought events the aim of this study is to empirically analyze the effect of long term climate variables and recent extreme drought events on cropland decisions as an adaptation mechanism by small scale farmers in dryland areas in chile we use individual and commune level data from the 7th chilean national agriculture and forestry census 9 to identify crop choices as well as long term climate data to calculate average temperature and precipitation and identify drought related shocks and their historical frequency several studies have discussed how climate relates to agriculture and food security from an economic point of view some of these studies have used the general equilibrium approach 2 2 this approach uses computable general equilibrium cge methods to simulate the equilibrium theory formalized by arrow and debreu 1954 see e g refs 10 11 other studies have used the ricardian approach 3 3 these studies discuss how climate e g temperature and precipitation and geographic variables e g soil quality affect farmers revenue and land value see e g refs 12 14 mendelsohn et al 2010 15 16 and others have tried to understand farmers adaptation to the climate 4 4 these studies use choice models to try to understand how farmers adapt to the climate see e g refs 17 25 this paper contributes to the literature in three main aspects first the identification of droughts relies on the use of spatial climate data which can be more accurate than standard records and allow analyzing the effect of historical events this information could in turn determine producers background risk to severe droughts second unlike other studies the empirical strategy allows us to simultaneously model the proportion of land that is devoted to each crop category mullahy 2012 third it provides evidence about farmers approaches to adaptation in the context of an emerging economy chile offers an interesting setting to study the impact of weather events on the one hand the country has an extensive history of extreme weather events because of el niño and la niña phenomena on the other hand extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency as global temperatures rise 26 this study is divided into the following sections section 2 describes the agricultural sector and climate in chile section 3 characterizes crop farming as an adaptation strategy to climate change sections 4 and 5 present the econometric model and data respectively section 6 discusses the main results section 7 evaluates a set of robustness checks section 8 summarizes the main findings and section 9 discusses the policy implications of the study 2 agriculture and climate in chile according to the 27 the chilean agricultural sector represents around 5 of the county s gross domestic product gdp and contributes to 10 of national employment more than 50 of its production is sold in international markets some major agricultural products include fruits grapes apples pears peaches and berries horticulture garlic onions and asparagus and cereal and tubers wheat maize and potatoes in terms of socioeconomic and cultural factors 73 4 of farmers have farms that are smaller than 20 ha 28 most farmers are male and have not finished primary school as for small scale farmers this sector represents one third of the agricultural gross domestic product agdp and contributes to 1 2 of the chilean gdp moreover this sector provides around 60 of the food consumed in domestic markets and controls 85 of total farms in the country 29 according to ine 2007 around 55 of farmland under small scale agriculture was not irrigated at the time of the study this can be due to farmers being located in dryland areas or lacking irrigation technology despite having potential access to water 30 a relatively larger increase in modern irrigation adoption has been observed among larger farmers 2 climate change is expected to affect dryland agriculture more greatly than irrigated agriculture because of its interaction with the changes in temperature and water availability 31 chile has a great deal of climatic diversity cities located in the north have on average less precipitation and higher temperatures compared to those located in the south according to vicuña et al 2013 temperatures in chile have increased considerably and precipitation events have substantially decreased in magnitude and frequency during the last four decades this can also be seen in figs 1 and 2 which show that communal temperatures in the period 2002 2006 have increased compared with the period 1950 1954 conversely average precipitation has decreased during the same period chilean climate is also affected by el niño southern oscillation enso an ocean atmosphere phenomenon associated with changes in precipitation although we do not intend on studying enso s effect on farmers decisions this phenomenon can be related to the presence of droughts and floods see e g ref 32 thus this phenomenon may affect the chilean agricultural sector 33 as well as the national gdp 34 and its effects are expected to increase in frequency 26 3 crop farming and weather risk catastrophic risks such as droughts can have a cumulative effect on individuals decisions and behavior 6 they can also increase individuals risk vulnerability and as suggested by ref 7 increase farmers background risk this effect may induce individuals to undertake less risky activities creating ex ante effects on farmers crop allocation decisions a similar behavior is expected to occur in response to more contemporaneous weather risks which arise in response to past realization of weather related shocks 24 these shocks could also have the potential to affect contemporaneous crop allocation decisions with more recent events expected to greatly affect producers allocation decisions when compared with events taking place further apart adaptation can be considered a response to risks associated with environmental hazards or human vulnerability 35 one of the typical ways to deal with risks is by using insurance however the uptake of climate farm insurance is rather low salazar et al 2019 which means that farmers are more likely to rely on their own crop choices as a risk mitigation mechanism there are two strands of literature devoted to farmers land allocation decisions the first group of literature comes from the area of agricultural production this literature suggests that producers crop choices are determined by the availability or lack of key production inputs such as irrigation and by farm characteristics such as land tenure and scale of production 36 37 these studies also indicate that crop choice and crop diversity not only respond to changes in relative prices of crops and fertilizers 37 but also to consumption price risk kurosaki and fafchamps 2002 38 find that farmers choose a crop mix characterized by greater crop diversity if diversity is positively related to productivity and negatively correlated with production and income variability these authors also evidence that risk averse farmers cope with the uncertainty they face by allocating land to different crop species 39 the second group of literature is devoted to analyzing the effect of climate change background risk and short run weather events on farmers decisions this literature suggests that farmers may adapt to catastrophic risks by choosing low risk cropping activities instead of those with higher risks in response to background risk 7 from an agronomic perspective during a drought farmers may prefer crop categories that have shorter growing periods and therefore lower water requirements 5 5 technical water requirements for growing a particular crop are given by crop coefficient kc criteria described by allen et al 1998 this situation explains why farmers also react to short run extreme weather events by changing the amount of land devoted to specific crops 40 conduct a systematic revision of the available approaches to understand how individuals adapt to climate this revision suggests two main strands of literature 1 adaptation to long term changes in mean climate and 2 adaptation to short run changes in weather which can be understood as drivers of the variance of climate the first strand of literature has mainly relied on cross sectional and simulation analysis of changes in climate see e g refs 10 15 18 20 41 42 for instance ref 19 evaluate how south american farmers adapt to climate by changing their crops by analyzing how the land allocated to the seven most popular crops in the region maize potato rice soybean squash and wheat responds to changes in temperature and precipitation results show that farmers who work in colder regions are more likely to choose potatoes and wheat while those working in regions with higher average temperatures tend to choose maize soybeans and rice farmers in warm locations choose fruits and vegetables and squash similar studies were conducted in africa 18 and china 20 with similar results according to ref 40 this evidence indicates that farmers adapt by changing their crop choices as the climate warms suggesting that adaptation could have the potential to ameliorate damages attributable to climate change the second strand of literature relies primarily on panel data analysis exploiting intertemporal variation in weather and the subsequent effects of weather shocks on individuals decisions see e g refs 16 17 21 25 43 for instance ref 24 study how farmers in mozambique shifted land use patterns after weather shocks concluding that crop choices are sensitive to recent weather shocks and that the farmers are more responsive to more severe droughts they also find that farmers tend to relocate farms from high risk to lower risk cropping activities according to ref 40 evidence from this literature sheds light on the difficulty of adapting to weather shocks and the subsequent lack of effectiveness in counteracting damages from weather shocks consequently producers and society as a whole will most likely to remain vulnerable to climate variance 4 empirical strategy to analyze the effect of long term climate variables and recent extreme drought events on farmers cropland decisions we propose estimating a multivariate fractional model 44 we consider a population of i 1 n farmers the variable of interest is 0 y i k 1 which represents the share of cropland for the k th crop category k 1 m for the i th individual this is 1 e y i k x i r i z i t 1 g x i β k r i δ k z i t 1 γ k 0 1 k 1 m 2 m 1 m e y i k x i r i z i t 1 1 where x i represents the vector of the producer s household s and farm s physical characteristics r i includes long term climate variables i e average temperature and precipitation historical droughts and z i t 1 represents the vector of immediate past weather characteristics i e droughts the coefficients β δ and γ are the parameters to be estimated g represents the linking function which in this case corresponds to the logistic function λ thus the conditional mean of our empirical model is 3 e y i k x i r i z i t 1 e x p x i β k r i δ k z i t 1 γ k m 1 m e x p x i β k r i δ k z i t 1 γ k k 1 m 44 suggests the estimation procedure proposed by ref 45 this is a quasi maximum likelihood method qml which relies on the bernoulli log likelihood function q 4 q β γ i 1 n m 1 m e y i k x i r i z i t 1 y i m which is maximized to obtain the qml estimator 5 j β γ l o g q β γ i 1 n m 1 m y i m l o g e y i k x i r i z i t 1 then the marginal effects are obtained by 6 p e i m k e y i m x i r i z i t 1 x i k r i z ik 5 data this study uses data from the 7th chilean national agriculture and forestry census this is the main source of data on the current state of agricultural and forestry resources and the rural population in chile this census was conducted in 2007 with 2006 being the reference period the observational unit is at the farmer level covering approximately 256 711 agricultural producers spread across the whole country 9 6 6 because we only observe single year individual observations our empirical analysis is based on cross sectional data although there was a previous attempt at gathering a previous round of the census from 1997 being year 1996 the reference period this information was aggregated at the commune level this situation prevented us from conducting a panel data analysis while still exploiting individual heterogeneity of producers for policy interventions the ministry of agriculture defines small farmers within the framework of family farmers as those holding 12 ha or less of basic irrigation hbi fao 2009 we follow this definition in this paper similarly we define dryland agriculture as either areas without access to water or areas with the potential for irrigation that cannot be fully exploited by producers 7 7 the national census allows to identify some crop categories that are grown in areas without access to water secano or dry areas these categories can be fully identified from the data and include cereals legume and tubers industrial crops grapevines and seed crops however there are other crop categories fruits and vegetables for which this information is not disaggregated in such cases we define a crop as being grown in dryland areas when it is produced in the absence of irrigation for this analysis crops that are grown in either condition are regarded as dryland agriculture the census information is combined with climate remote sensing data e g temperature and precipitation obtained from the east anglia climatic research university cru and the global spei database 5 1 sociodemographic and agricultural data the 7th national agriculture and forestry census 9 reports surveyed data aggregated at the farmer level it provides information on farmers socio demographic and productive characteristics such as land distribution input use use of credit among others notice that at the moment of this study this is the only and most current available public data that is representative of chilean agriculture because of chilean geographical conditions most farms are located in central south chile the northern and southern extremes of the country were excluded from the census 8 8 because of their extreme weather conditions and geographic characteristics regions located in extreme areas of chile i e northern and southern regions are regarded as natural handicaps and agricultural activities cannot take place consequently these areas are excluded from the census to construct the dependent variables and following the census data we begin by classifying the farmer production portfolio into eight crop categories cereals cerp legume and tubers ltor industrial crops cindu grapevines or vineyards vinpl fruits frut seed crops cseed vegetables 9 9 this category includes vegetables and flowers vegt and land under a set aside scheme barb subsequently we consider a more disaggregated classification covering the three most important crops in chilean agriculture wheat potatoes and maize control variables at the producer and farm levels include gender age education total number of plots total area of useable land wheat yield per hectare 10 10 this variable is measured by quintal per hectare or 100 kg per hectare the inclusion of wheat economic conditions responds to the assumption that farmers have a status quo crop from which they decide to move out if incentives are attractive enough in chilean agriculture wheat is the most important crop and it can grow in diverse agro ecological conditions across the national territory thus wheat can be considered as the status quo in the sense that farmers will move in or out of this production to other alternatives depending on changes in its economic incentives price of wheat powder 11 11 price information varying spatially is available from the office of studies and agrarian policies odepa starting in 2014 we use the consumer price index cpi to correct for inflation water access at the farm level 12 12 this a dummy variable takes a value of 1 if the farmer reports having access to water and zero otherwise the options for water sources are wells springs rivers streams seasonally regulated reservoirs yearly regulated reservoirs lakes lagoons and others a measure of soil erosion at the commune level 13 13 soil quality was proxied using information on soil erosion ciren 2010 the measure of erosion integrates a set of soil topographic climatic and biological characteristics thus erosion will be more severe to the extent that soils are more porous and sandier and that fields are more sloped and hold less vegetation as well as in locations where a large amount of rain falls in a short time we use the percentage of agricultural land with some degree of erosion hectares and a set of dummy variables indicating the use of technology 14 14 certified seeds biologic pest control organic farming and fertirrigation credit 15 15 bank credit agrarian development institute indap credit or other governmental support 16 16 sirsd degraded soil program prochile fpea law n 18 450 irrigation and law no 19 561 and any other type of support such as subsidized insurance 17 17 indap gtt corfo fia bpa pabco sence and crop insurance as well as participation in a farm association finally there is a set of dummy variables denoting the country s macro zones to proxy for geographical characteristics i e north center center south and south a summary of control variables is depicted in table 1 5 2 geo spatial and biophysical data for drought identification we use the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei this drought index proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 can be used as an alternative to other drought indexes such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi 18 18 based on the soil water balance 46 and the standardized precipitation index spi 19 19 based on the probability of precipitation 47 as it combines features from both for this study we use the spei dataset version 2 5 from which we selected the period that covers the time of year when crops require more water for their physiological growth across chile to capture the effects of drought events we generate dummy variables indicating the presence of a shock of this sort in the past 20 20 because of the cross sectional nature of our data these variables should not be understood as lagged variables of the covariates of interest our rationale is that although these events have taken place in the past they have the potential to affect crop allocation in our reference period we are particularly interested in assessing the effect of weather shocks occurring in periods t 1 and t 2 respectively therefore we define a shock occurring in t 1 as the presence of severe droughts during the period september 2005 february 2006 i e based on the spei 6 months similarly a shock occurring in period t 2 is defined as the presence of severe droughts during the period september 2004 february 2005 i e based on the spei 6 months these periods correspond to the spring summer season in the country which are relevant for planting decisions these variables are intended to capture short term effects of recent weather events on crop choices we also use the spei 12 months for february from 1950 to 2006 to create a historical record of the number of severe drought events occurring in that period this information is intended to capture the background risk of the droughts for a given commune we use spei scores to construct the dummy variables used in our analysis these variables take the value of 1 if the spei scores indicate moderate and or severe extreme droughts and 0 otherwise the spei reference values used to identify drought events are displayed in table 2 fig 3 displays the areas affected by the droughts during the reference periods long term climate variables including monthly precipitation and temperatures were obtained from the cru ts 3 24 dataset as with drought temperature and precipitation were transformed to communal data and correspond to annual average temperature c and precipitations mm from 1970 to 2007 with this data we intend to capture the long term effect of climate on crop choice see table 3 6 results 6 1 small scale farming in dryland area baseline model we start with a model that estimates the long term effects of climate on land allocation this includes only average temperature and precipitations from the last 38 years and the frequency of droughts estimated coefficients are shown in tables 4 and 5 we then include short term effects on land use choice by adding lagging drought variables we tested different lags separately estimated coefficients are presented in tables 6 and 7 cereal is considered as baseline in all estimations thereby a positive sign of coefficients mean that farmers are moving away from cereals and increasing land in the corresponding crop category in contrast a negative coefficient can be interpreted as farmers devoting more land to cereal relative to the corresponding crop category marginal effects for the cereal category are shown in table 9 we begin by discussing results regarding long term climate variables climate patterns outlined in figs 1 and 2 suggest that farmers will continue growing crops in the face of higher temperatures and lower precipitations i e in higher drought risk thus it is expected that farmers adapt in some way to these new climate conditions by including the average temperature and precipitation as well as a measure of historical droughts affecting cropland allocation we intend to capture the level of background risk of each farmer with this information we can shed light on the expected long term patterns of crop reallocation results reveal that farmers exposed to higher temperature grow mostly cereals and are more likely to plant vineyards more land dedicated to vineyards in places with higher temperatures may respond to evidence that certain water stress levels may have a positive influence on the quality of grapevines this finding is in line with current predictions in chile that vineyards are likely to move south as temperatures rise in cooler places in locations with higher average precipitations we find that farmers are more likely to reduce land for cereals increasing land for vineyards fruits industrial crops legumes tubers and vegetables results also show that the proportion of land left uncultivated is lower in places with more rainfall and higher temperature these weather conditions may be seen beneficial for agricultural production in sum where higher temperatures and lower levels of precipitations are expected long term our estimations suggest that farmers are likely to adapt by devoting a larger fraction of agricultural land to cereals and vineyards however a scenario with less rainfall can also be harmful for vineyard farming results also suggest that farmers operating in high drought risk areas are adapting to these conditions by planting more vineyards legumes tubers and vegetables while more vineyards in high drought risk areas can be explained by the benefits of exposing wine grapes to drier conditions more land for vegetables can be the result of the great variety of species and planting periods that these crops can support such adaptation responses are also outlined by ref 22 the increased share of agricultural land devoted to horticulture could also be explained by the possibility of cultivating vegetables near urban areas where there is access to tap water finally the short and flexible farming cycle of potatoes and their ability to grow in poor growing conditions may explain a larger area for legumes and tubers in high drought risk areas our results indicate that small scale farmers in dryland areas react to recent past climate events their response however depends on the timing of drought shocks farmers located in zones experiencing a drought shock in t 1 devote more land to cereals moving away from vineyards industrial and seed crops an increase in cereals may be linked to lower technological and capital requirements of these specific crops compared to other crop categories drought shocks occurring in t 2 reveal a reverse in the crop allocation pattern confirming that farmers react to recent drought in the short term from marginal effect estimations see table 9 results show that farmers reduce the land share devoted to cereals after a drought in t 2 which may reflect a re adjustment of their buffer stocks of food crops for consumption that is farmers may have over produced cereals in t 1 to recover a diminished buffer stock by the time climate normalizes in time t farmers may have reduced the land share for cereals to adjust for normal production and consumption needs the same short term dynamic is observed in other crops these findings are in line with 17 who show that land use changes are correlated with both lagged and simultaneous climate variables finally more land left uncultivated after a drought in t 2 may be the result of substantial material losses that farmers have to cover after a drought shock which reduce resources for the coming seasons also droughts can exhaust soil quality affecting its agricultural productive potential for the next agricultural season consequently farmers may temporally decide to move away from the farm and look for off farm income sources 6 2 by crops table 8 presents the estimated coefficients for extended categories of crops including wheat wheat maize maize and potatoes pot wheat is left as the baseline category results do not change when incorporating climate variables sequentially so we only show estimations for the general model table 9 shows the marginal effects of climate variables on wheat land share notice that wheat and maize are cereals while potatoes belong to the legumes and tubers category the remaining crop varieties are regarded as nontraditional cereals ocerp and nontraditional legumes and tubers oltor the other crop categories are also included in the model regarding long term climate variables results confirm that farmers mainly grow cereals and vineyards in places with higher temperatures disaggregating the cereal category shows that wheat and maize are driving these results a positive coefficient for maize suggests that adaptation to higher temperature is occurring more significantly in this crop than in wheat 19 we also find that more rainfall is beneficial for farming vineyards fruits industrial crops and vegetables when disaggregating legumes and tubers crops between potatoes and other crops we find that farmers devote more land to potatoes in places with higher levels of precipitation but that response does not generally hold for other legumes and tuber crops in addition our proxy of background risk for drought shows that farmers are more likely to increase their land share for potatoes this finding suggests that potato farming may be an adaptation strategy in drier conditions which can be explained because potatoes longer roots benefit from humidity over longer periods also potatoes are recognized for being a classic crop for food security having a shorter and more flexible farming cycle as well as the possibility to be left underground to wait for better harvesting conditions thus creating greater resilience to drought in the short term results show that farmers are more likely to increase the share of land allocated to wheat in locations suffering a drought in t 1 reallocating resources away from potatoes and maize farming see table 9 for marginal effects this suggests that the main effect on cereals is driven by wheat given the relevance of the wheat crop for chilean agriculture this result suggests that the consequences of droughts may have substantial effects on national wheat market prices interestingly the short term dynamic previously discussed regarding cereals is also observed in wheat farming and maize but it is inverse in the latter case thus farmers seem to adjust these crop areas after two periods in order to satisfy normal production needs in the case of wheat a well developed wheat milling industry in chile allows farmers to process the whole grains and turn it into flour which makes it possible to store this product for a longer time 7 robustness 7 1 excluding permanent crops while annual crops are produced from plants which last one season permanent crops such as vineyards and fruits are perennial and not replanted after each harvest thus it is not easy to adjust permanent crop land in the short term permanent crops may also have additional expenses in installation and maintenance 48 one of the most plausible explanations for any short term change in these crops relates to how permanent crop farming is carried out and estimated in most cases farmers practice inter cropping meaning that it is unusual for tree crops to be the only cultivated crop in an area consequently any short term change in permanent crop land share probably indicates that farmers are simply modifying intercropping practices to allow for more dynamic responses we remove vineyards and fruit crops from our estimations and leave crops whose planting decisions are made annually estimated coefficients for farmers responses when excluding permanent crops are presented in table a1 the omission of these categories does not fundamentally change the results farmers still move from seed and industrial crops to cereals in zones affected by a drought in t 1 7 2 drought intensity an additional concern with our definition of drought shocks is that it relies on a binary identification of events to explore whether this is important we re estimate our main specification by replacing the binary drought variable with a continuous drought metric lower values in this variable indicate a more severe dry cycle see figure a1 thus a negative effect will indicate an increase in the share of land devoted to a given crop category in response to a higher drought intensity these results are reported in table a2 as before we find that farmers move from fruit industrial seed and vegetable crops to increase the share of land allocated to cereal after a more severe drought event supporting the risk averse behavior discussed previously this may suggest that during periods of more severe water shortage farmers react more strongly by moving a larger share of land to staple crops this behavior can be interpreted as a way to guarantee food security over productivity the negative effect on vineyard area simply reinforces the benefits that drier conditions provide for the quality of wine grapes a reduction in uncultivated areas during high severity droughts suggests that farmers may reallocate part of this fallow land to increase the land area devoted to staples 7 3 accounting for omitted variable bias one of the weakness of the cross sectional data models is their limited ability to control for time trends and time varying characteristics and in dealing with unobserved individual heterogeneity to address some of these issues we use 1997 agricultural census data and estimate a pooled fractional probit pfp for panel data suggested by ref 49 this model accounts for unobserved effects by adding the mean of varying control variables as proposed by chamberlin 1980 it is worth mentioning however that the aggregation level of the 1997 census prevents us from estimating a farmer level regression isolating small scale farmers and dryland conditions as well as accounting for interrelations among crop categories consequently dependent and control variables are aggregated and the model is estimated at the communal level for each crop separately as additional controls we add the share of area under traditional itrad and modern irrigation itec as well as the proportion of land under secure tenancy property right estimated coefficients are presented in table a3 results show that the effects of a drought are stronger two years after the event as the only variable responding to this effect is at t 2 farmers seem to reduce their land share proportion of cereals and increase their land share of the set aside option which is in line with what we described in our baseline model insignificant results at t 1 may be associated with the high level of aggregation of the data leading to a lower number of observations and making the result less comparable to the cross sectional model 7 4 accounting for spatial correlation one further concern is the existence of spatial correlation this is an important issue in agriculture as crop choices are supposed to follow certain spatial patterns we try to deal with spatial correlation in two ways first we clustered our standard errors at the commune level in all our estimations second we present results of estimations of spatial econometric models to incorporate spatial auto correlation or neighborhood effect to feed this kind of model it is crucial to have data on farmer s coordinates to identify their spatial locations unfortunately data on farmers location is confidential and therefore not available as an alternative we collapse our farmer level data into commune level data and estimate a spatial lag model slm and spatial error model sem following similar specifications to the ones outlined in section 7 3 estimations of the slm and sem for each category separately are shown in table a4 and a5 respectively both models suggest some degree of spatial correlation rho and lambda are statistically significant results differ from our baseline model however they tend to follow a similar pattern for recent drought events in cereals farmers are more likely to reduce their land share in the face of a drought in t 2 insignificant coefficients at t 1 do not necessarily mean that our results are not robust to spatial correlation but they may imply new data issues from collapsing farmer data into commune level data 8 conclusions in this study we analyzed the effects of droughts on cropland decisions among small scale farmers in dryland areas in chile using agricultural census data as well as climate remote sensing data we estimated a multivariate fractional logit to model the proportion of land allocated to different crop categories our results show that small scale farmers are sensitive to recent past drought events and farmers responses are larger depending on drought intensity the pattern of reallocation suggests an increase in the share of cereal in dryland environments after a recent drought shock which signals a risk averse behavior this finding suggests that farmers react after a recent drought by choosing crop categories with short growing periods and lower capital costs and technological requirements larger land areas devoted to staple crops during periods of more severe droughts suggest that food security may overcome productivity concerns in this reallocation we also found that crop reallocation to cereals e g wheat seems to follow a short term pattern which may reflect the maintenance of a buffer stock in the farm in terms of background risk and long term responses we found that farmers seem to adapt to their environment they may prefer legumes and tubers vineyards and fruits in high drought risk areas while cereal and industrial crops are preferred in low risk areas moreover maize and vineyards are more likely to be grown in places with higher temperatures findings are robust to the exclusion of perennial crop categories and to the use of a continuous measure of drought intensity 9 policy implications our findings have important implications for the success of government interventions to address concerns of changes in agricultural land due to a more arid environment in the future because climate change is expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of droughts as well as temperature our results shed light on the importance of incorporating background risk in the design of policy measures for adaptation this would require for instance the promotion of extension services cultivation techniques aimed at enhancing productivity by farmers who have already adapted by adopting crops that are more resistant to and even benefit from water stress on the other hand farmers in low risk areas would benefit from longer term policy instruments aimed at supporting farmers in their process of adaptation our results also highlight the importance of targeting soil erosion which is a common problem in areas with high drought probability as we show in this study a significant proportion of the agricultural area in drylands remains uncultivated the lack of vegetation in combination with short term intense rain can lead to increased runoff which would further affect soil quality imposing negative consequences on farmers income credit authorship

8674,in the 2016 2018 drought cape town almost ran out of municipal water tariff increases restrictions and campaigns brought big reductions in water use during the dry spring and summer months 14 3 in september 2017 when non compliant households were threatened with a water usage restriction meter 17 2 in october when a disaster plan threatened residents with collecting water daily at 200 points across the city and 20 1 24 3 when day zero appeared unavoidable water pressure was reduced usage was restricted to 50 l per person per day and exponential tariff hikes were introduced transparent information about the severity of the crisis and shifting the responsibility for crisis avoidance to residents amplified water savings at the height of the drought keywords water demand management water conservation drought 1 introduction from 2016 to 2018 cape town south africa suffered what was widely claimed to be the worst drought in 100 years and came dramatically close to running out of municipal water people began to talk about day zero the day that cape town s taps would run dry and residents would have to collect a daily allocation of 25 l of water at communal water points across the city cape town s predicament caused public panic and drew the attention of international media at the height of the crisis 1 the city of cape town hiked the water tariffs repeatedly imposed drastic restrictions on water usage reduced the water pressure and released media campaigns urging people to save water the result was a 50 water usage decrease in less than three years fig 1 up to may 2015 before the drought average households in freestanding houses with a private water connection were using 183l per person per day in 2018 this dropped to 84l per person per day a dramatic reduction of 54 in contrast during the 2003 2008 millennium drought in southeast queensland australia usage was 129l per person per day compared to 375l under non drought conditions 2 and in california in 2015 during the 2012 2016 drought usage was 242l 146 gallons per person per day 3 cape town has a mediterranean climate with most of the annual rainfall in winter the city s water supply system is 88 dependent on rainfall and 12 on augmentation from groundwater 4 in 2017 after the june to august rains the dam levels were at 32 a big drop from the 58 in 2016 fig 2 aggravating the water problem cape town s population increased by 46 in just 15 years 1996 2011 5 and the city s strategy to cope with this primarily relied on water conservation and demand side management to curb usage as opposed to investment in new supply sources 6 despite the population growth however until the drought water demand had remained steady since 2000 in this paper we review water usage patterns and the four measures the city applied to drastically reduce usage increased tariffs usage restrictions pressure reductions and information campaigns fig 3 our sample was drawn from a municipal utilities database of around 300 000 domestic freestanding households in the city of cape town we used a panel of monthly household usage over a period of four years june 2014 to may 2018 we used the month to month fluctuations in water use during the pre drought year june 2014 to may 2015 to calculate a normal trend percentage increase decrease of water use we superimposed this trend on each drought month m 1 to obtain a water use comparison in the subsequent drought month m this allowed us to capture changes in consumption for a drought month that depart from any normal changes seasonal fluctuation that would be expected during a non drought year at the beginning of the drought water use reductions were likely the result of specific interventions that were implemented individually however the correlation of water usage reductions and drought interventions may be exaggerated in cases where an intervention did not influence water use immediately but took longer to take effect in months where interventions were bundled we can only talk about the correlation of water usage reductions and drought intervention packages 2 literature to reduce water demand to align with available supply in times of water scarcity policy makers can apply increasingly stringent price based or non price based demand side measures 7 price based measures directly target the consumer s pocket via water tariffs non price based measures target behavior for example via water restrictions that limit irrigation or total daily household usage often with penalties in case of non compliance or via public information and education campaigns to encourage voluntary savings 8 9 both types are discussed below tariff increases several studies have shown only a moderate effect of tariff hikes on water usage they show that as residential water demand is inelastic with price elasticities between 0 1 and 0 3 a 10 increase in price would reduce demand for water by 1 to 3 9 13 jansen and schulz 2006 14 found that in cape town where high levels of inequality prevail high income households with a price elasticity of 0 97 are more price sensitive than low income households with a price elasticity of 0 32 however those studies were not done during a major drought like cape town s where percentage increases in price were very large towards the end of the drought after a tariff increase usage is reduced not immediately but gradually as people adopt water efficient equipment and change their water use habits 7 martínez espineira and nauges 2004 15 found that the amount of water usage that is non responsive to price changes i e water used for basic needs in the short run is around 3 kl per person per month note that the amount of water these authors describe as basic needs is much higher than the 25 l p d that the who and un say is necessary for essential hygiene and basic food needs they suggest that once such low levels of usage are achieved information campaigns should be launched or water efficient appliances promoted to achieve further reductions towards the end of the cape town drought residents were consuming much less than 3 kl per person per month and indeed a combination of measures were used to further reduce consumption water restrictions studies of the impact of restrictions on residential water usage during a drought found average reductions of between 16 and 28 7 9 16 19 during the 2000 2010 california drought los angeles started water conservation interventions with voluntary measures in june 2007 residents were asked to reduce usage by 10 in august 2008 mandatory restrictions on irrigation were introduced in june 2009 washing of vehicles and filling of pools were prohibited and the second tier water price was increased by 44 19 cape town s water conservation measures were much more stringent 10 reductions were aimed at from the start january 2016 and usage was restricted even further as the drought escalated mini et al 2014 19 assessed the effectiveness of different levels of restrictions on reducing water usage in single family households in california from 2008 to 2010 comparing predicted to actual usage they found that voluntary restrictions did not lead households to reduce their usage significantly whereas mandatory restrictions in combination with a tariff increase brought a 23 decline in usage during an earlier drought in california 1985 1992 the mandatory water allocation policy that was introduced in goleta in july 1989 with high penalties for exceeding the household allocation reduced average residential water demand by 28 and the banning of all irrigation in santa barbara reduced the demand by 16 7 pressure reductions reducing water pressure by installing pressure reducing valves can drastically decrease water loss from leaking pipes and plumbing fittings especially during times of low usage 20 during the millennium drought in australia investments in leakages and pressure management programs were made to increase water efficiency turner et al 2016 21 report that the public interest in saving water during the drought further increased the reporting of leaks and response times such programs were much less costly than expanding water supply infrastructure in sydney one third of all households were part of the waterfix program 1999 2011 which included household water audits and retrofit programs the program costed usd 53 m aud 73 m and is reported to have saved over 10 100 ml a by 2011 savings per household were 21 kl a 22 another pressure and leak management program on the gold coast in australia was estimated to save 26 ml day 9 490 ml a if implemented citywide 23 public information and education campaigns water saving campaigns are commonly used during water stressed periods to curb demand in the short term and have shown reductions of between 11 and 28 24 29 campaigns to raise public awareness and promote behavioral change can help to avoid the necessity for other measures such as price increases and are therefore politically acceptable but doubts remain regarding their cost effectiveness and potential to effect long term change 8 studies mainly assess the impact of campaigns through narrative reviews or statistical analysis such as regressions 24 28 during the 2005 2015 drought in california s san francisco bay area quesnel and ajami 2017 29 analyzed the link between increased media attention to a drought and household water conservation levels their assessment of news media coverage showed that an increase of 100 drought related media articles was associated with a water usage reduction of 11 18 previous studies have mostly concentrated on one type of water demand management intervention and have not covered several types in one analysis the variety of increasingly restrictive measures implemented during the cape town drought is unusual and they were also much more stringent than drought measures analyzed in previous studies outdoor usage is commonly restricted during water supply shortages but in cape town indoor water usage was also restricted to 50 l p d at the height of the drought the cape town campaigns were multi faceted and went further than the traditional public information campaigns and news articles that previous studies have investigated they provided more transparent information and even reprimanded high water users for their excessive consumption 3 methods we analyzed the correlation of water usage reductions and the various measures that were implemented as cape town s drought escalated towards a crisis we used a municipal utilities database to collect a panel of monthly usage by around 300 000 domestic freestanding households in the city over a four year period june 2014 to may 2018 ideally we would have liked to use a difference in differences design where water use is observed for two groups treatment and control for two periods pre and post the treatment group would be exposed to a drought intervention in the post period but not in the pre period the control group would not be exposed to any drought intervention in any period we could then compare the before after change in the treated households with the before after change in the control households to tease out the effect of the drought interventions such an approach was infeasible because all households in cape town faced the same levels of water use restrictions tariff rate increases and conservation campaigns at the same time another approach could have been to use a simple before after design however since many interventions occurred over the period from may 2015 to may 2018 a before after design would lead us to measure the impact of all the interventions leveraged through the drought household water use reduced more than 50 between may 2015 and may 2018 it would not be possible to establish any kind of relationship between reduction in water use and exposure to drought interventions at different points in time as more and more measures were implemented as the drought escalated for each drought intervention we ideally want to exclude the impact of previous interventions as far as possible and look at the impact of the most immediate interventions at different points in time a water use comparison value in any drought month is calibrated from the preceding month in the drought we want to know what water use in a drought month would have looked like if no intervention had occurred to get this water use comparison we use the month to month fluctuations in water use during the pre drought year june 2014 to may 2015 to calculate a normal percentage increase decrease of water use we superimpose this trend on each drought month m 1 to obtain a water use comparison in the subsequent drought month m this allows us to capture changes in consumption for a drought month that departs from any normal changes seasonal fluctuation that would be expected during a non drought year we used this specific non drought period 2014 15 to construct the water use comparison value because no strong restrictions or unusual tariff increases were implemented during that time we calculated the water use comparison values in the following way w a t e r u s e c o m p a r i s o n d r o u g h t m u s a g e d r o u g h t m 1 u s a g e p r e d r o u g h t m u s a g e p r e d r o u g h t m 1 where u s a g e d r o u g h t m 1 is the average water usage in the previous month in the drought period u s a g e p r e d r o u g h t m the average usage in a month in the pre drought period and u s a g e p r e d r o u g h t m 1 the average usage in the previous month in the pre drought period where a household s data were missing we imputed the data from the average water usage in that suburb and tariff block for example usage was 0 535 kl in september 2014 and 0 603 kl in october 2014 an increase of 13 usage in september 2016 was 0 478 kl on the assumption that usage patterns in 2016 would match those of the pre drought year we would expect again to see a 13 increase from september to october usage in october 2016 would then be 0 540 kl but in fact it was 0 503 kl 7 lower than expected comparing water use in each drought month to its constructed comparison value we could align it as closely as possible with the measures that were phased in during the drought we used the following regression framework to determine the difference between actual water use and the constructed comparison value in the drought period y i β 0 β 1 a c t u a l d u m m y i β 2 x i ε i where y i is actual water use or the constructed comparison value a c t u a l d u m m y i is equal to 1 for actual water usage and 0 for the constructed water use comparison x i is a vector of controls including property values as a proxy for household income suburb and an indicator for indigent status households that are part of the indigent support program receive access to affordable basic municipal services water refuse removal electricity and property rates depending on their property value and monthly income households are either automatically classified as indigent or can apply for indigent status separate regressions were run for each month in each month there is one true observation for each household and one constructed comparison observation the average sample size per month is approximately 600 000 account numbers we are interested in the coefficient β 1 which gives the difference between actual water use and the constructed comparison value i e the effect of the combined drought interventions that were implemented at a certain point during the drought if we see a change in water usage at this point in time we associate the changes with the interventions that were phased in over this period we used a robust regression method to control for heteroscedasticity and outliers for our analysis we used the year 2014 15 as pre drought period water use in cape town is strongly seasonal and we assumed that this water use pattern high water use in the south african summer months low water use during the winter season would continue throughout the drought our approach does not take into account any temporal changes that would have taken place independent of interventions i e we assume that there were no time trends that would have distorted the results we further assume that we have taken all public initiatives and policies into account that were implemented over the drought it is however possible that we have missed some smaller less known interventions an important point to raise here is that if we used the pre drought water use only to calculate the water use comparison we would overestimate the impact restrictions towards the middle and end of the drought had because we would not consider usage reductions that were achieved by previous interventions we therefore look at different points in time during the drought and the number of interventions that were rolled out individually or in combination at that time we make the presumption that interventions are most likely to influence water use in the following month due to the severity of the drought changes in tariffs and restriction levels were much more discussed than during normal times on a variety of media platforms given the media hype around the city of cape town s interventions there generally was high public alert to the drought measures the city of cape town registered increased website traffic on their homepage multiple billboards on the side of the roads announced increases in restriction levels journalists extensively covered restriction level changes and announcements that were made by the city residents discussed restriction levels and shared water saving tips on social media hence it was more likely that households would have responded in the short run rather than long run in this case we look at the behavioral response to an intervention in any two consecutive months of the drought year here are the implications of four different scenarios i when only one intervention was implemented in a given month and no other interventions were implemented in the few months prior water use reductions are likely the result of this intervention ii a drought intervention may affect water use for several months for example a water use restriction implemented on the 1st of january could be related to a 5 decrease in water use which is maintained if a campaign is launched a few months later for example on the 1st of april the april coefficient indicates the additional reduction that is likely related to the campaign iii where an intervention did not influence water use immediately it would lead us to overestimate the relation of water use reductions and subsequent interventions we did however expect responses to drought interventions to be immediate due to the level of public awareness during this time although this would bias our estimations upwards it is still possible to get a sense for which drought measures were more impactful than others iv if two or more interventions were launched in the same month we can only talk about the correlation of water usage reductions and intervention packages 4 measures tariffs were increased throughout the drought especially for consumers of greater volumes of water tariff increases were often implemented in combination with water usage restrictions water pressure was also reduced across the city information and education campaigns via the media were used to impress on residents the urgency of the situation ways to save water were explained with some campaigns specifically targeting high user households to encourage them to change their behavior immediately fig 3 shows an overview of the measures implemented over the drought period and the corresponding water usage reductions 4 1 tariff increases cape town s water tariffs have historically been low even insufficient to cover operating and maintenance costs 4 from the beginning of 2015 to mid 2017 consumers paid between r39 us 2 6 and r65 us 4 3 for 10 5 kl per month pricing is calculated on an increasing block tariff ibt structure consisting of six tariff blocks with an increase in each subsequent block table 1 in line with the south african constitution s requirement that all citizens must have access to basic services water in the first block up to 6 kl per month was provided for free regardless of household size or monthly income from the introduction of the free basic water policy in 2001 until july 2017 when this was restricted to indigent households only by july 2017 in response to the call to reduce usage 89 of households were consuming less than 20 kl per month leaving the municipality very little revenue at higher tariff blocks that could be used to subsidize the indigent and still pay for infrastructure and service delivery water prices were very high in the upper tariff blocks at the height of the water crisis but only a handful of households were consuming in tariff blocks 5 and 6 after january 2018 average water usage by the city went down by 45 in one year from 900 million liters per day in february 2017 to 500 million liters per day in february 2018 since this had severe knock on effects on the financial viability of the water services tariffs were increased substantially in february 2018 to increase revenue generation not just to restrict demand table 1 shows the tariff increases that were phased in over three years as the drought progressed in january 2016 level 2 water restrictions were introduced in combination with an increase in tariffs with the aim of reducing usage by 10 the increases were larger than they had been historically for the higher tariff blocks table 1 panel a the next tariff increase in july 2016 raised tariffs by a further 5 panel b the level 3 restrictions in december 2016 aiming to reduce demand by a further 20 increased tariffs by 8 the increases were particularly large for tariff block 6 30 the level 4b restrictions in july 2017 were accompanied by the cancellation of the free basic water policy for all households not part of the indigent support program in february 2018 with level 6b restrictions and repeated warnings of the imminence of day zero the biggest tariff increase was phased in and prices went up by 175 31 during most of cape town s water crisis prices stayed comparatively low before july 2017 10 5 kl per month cost r40 to r65 us 2 6 to us 4 3 in july 2017 the price of 10 5 kl per month increased to r94 us 6 2 in february 2018 the price of 10 5 kl per month increased to r365 us 24 to put cape town s water prices in perspective we note that in san francisco from 2010 to 2017 prices increased by between 119 and 127 meaning that for a four person household using 189 l 50 gallons per person per day or around 23 kl per month the price went up from us 31 r472 to us 67 r1019 32 before july 2017 23 kl per month cost r214 to r370 us 14 to us 24 while by february 2018 this had increased to r2215 us 146 in the lowest tariff bracket of 6 kl per month a usage level that many households even in the more affluent areas had reduced to at the height of the crisis prices stayed low 6 kl was free for all consumers until july 2017 increasing to r24 us 1 6 in july 2017 and to r158 us 10 in february 2018 4 2 restrictions at the beginning of the drought during the south african summer months restrictions were placed on outdoor water usage but as the drought escalated the municipality also restricted total daily household usage level 2 restrictions set specific days and times when municipal water could be used to water gardens levels 3 and 3b banned the use of hosepipes or irrigation systems and advised people to use a bucket or watering can to water the garden or wash the car 33 spot fines could be issued by water inspectors if residents did not obey the rules for outdoor water usage in june 2017 level 4 restrictions limited all water usage to 100 l per person per day effectively now including indoor water usage in the restrictions level 4 restrictions also prohibited the filling or topping up of swimming pools with municipal water and did not allow the washing of vehicles level 4b reduced the daily usage limit further to 87 l per person in september 2017 with level 5 restrictions 87 l p d but 20 kl h m the city started installing water management devices in non compliant households in an effort to enforce the restrictions high usage households were first issued with a warning letter telling them they were disobeying the restrictions they could be required to appear in court and as a result receive a fine or have a device installed the fine would be reissued every month that a household used above the limit in january 2018 level 6 restricted monthly water usage to 10 5 kl per household and level 6b reduced the limit to 50 l per person per day a month later 4 3 water pressure reductions to achieve further water savings water pressure reductions were scaled up during the drought water pressure management had been implemented across the city over a decade ago as part of the city s water demand management strategy pressure reducing valves in the water supply system made it possible to throttle pressure in specific supply zones at certain times pressure reductions were achieved particularly in the cape flats a low income area southeast of central cape town to decrease water loss from main pipe bursts and leaks in household pipes and plumbing fittings 20 when level 2 restrictions were introduced consumers were warned of the possibility of pressure reductions 34 media campaigns also told people how to reduce the flow of water from the municipal system to their households using a stopcock intense pressure management was announced and accelerated at the end of 2017 the south african summer and dry season in cape town and started to take effect in january and february 2018 at the height of the drought the aim was to establish new pressure management zones and to better manage the existing zones 35 while it is well known that pressure management reduces water loss for example from burst main pipes the link between water pressure and household water usage is not as well established a recent study in gauteng south africa 36 found that pressure changes have little effect on household usage partly because households already have pressure reducing valves installed commonly in the water heater 4 4 campaigns campaigns during the cape town drought aimed to raise awareness of the seriousness of the drought so people would change their behavior they provided transparent information about the state of the water supply and water demand situation the city of cape town also used shaming techniques to persuade extremely high water users to reduce their monthly usage in the beginning of the drought from november 2015 to may 2016 the city tested a variety of behavioral nudges to encourage cape town residents to use water more sparingly 37 brick et al 2018 find average water use reductions of 0 6 1 3 the most effective nudges were the ones officially recognizing household s conservation efforts and nudges asking households to save water because it is in the public interest wealthier households were particularly responsive to nudges framed around social incentives as the drought worsened and the target of 700 million liters of collective use per day had not been reached to drive home the need for radical behavioral change the city changed from the carrot to the stick approach and published a list of the top 100 water users divulged only by street names at the end of february 2017 38 at the same time the city sent letters to high water users monthly water use 50 kl in the letter high users were compared to the average cape town household they were reprimanded for excessive water use and threatened with the installation of a water restricting device high water consumers were further given information about the severity of the drought and ways to cut their consumption brühl serman and visser 2020 show that the letter significantly reduced water use in the short term a few months later on may 22 2017 the western cape was declared a disaster area 39 on august 17 2017 the mayor announced cape town s water resilience plan which included water augmentation plans including desalination plants and groundwater extraction to obtain an additional 500 million liters of water per day and water demand management plans including further restrictions pressure management and installation of water management devices in high usage households 40 next the three phased critical water shortages disaster plan 41 announced on october 1 2017 that cape town residents could be collecting their daily allocation of drinking water at 200 collection points across the city manned by police and army these announcements were followed by a flurry of alarmist media activity which grabbed the attention of most capetonians 42 in the following months the city aimed for greater transparency and public trust by sharing more detailed and timely information about the water crisis and the city s plans to manage it various interventions were launched such as the water dashboard which gave weekly updates about total water usage in cape town the city s augmentation plans the dam levels and the approaching day zero date 43 the mayor s prediction that april 21 would be day zero hit the local and international press on january 18 2018 this was probably the turning point in the water saving campaign as it brought home to residents the imminence of the crisis responsibility for avoiding day zero was shifted from the city onto residents who were asked to reduce usage still further in the same month the city launched the water map a website showing all the freestanding residential households that were complying with the water restrictions 44 the aim was to show residents how well their neighborhood was complying and to motivate them to reduce usage even further 5 water use reductions and drought measures fig 4 shows that water usage was much lower than expected throughout the drought particularly in the dry summer months around january seasonal variation in usage was much less marked than usual it was still visible in 2016 but almost non existent from 2017 to the beginning of 2018 table 2 shows the results of comparing each month s actual water usage to its constructed water use comparison values if the coefficient β 1 shows a decrease increase in water use in any given month we attribute the decrease increase to the intervention or the bundle of interventions that were introduced in that month at the beginning of the drought when interventions were only implemented every few months water use reductions were likely the result of specific interventions however towards the height of the drought interventions were implemented together or in close succession in this case we can only talk about the correlation of water usage reductions and drought intervention packages reductions of on average 11 5 to 8 7 were achieved when level 3 restrictions were introduced which allowed households to water their garden only using a bucket in combination with a tariff increase a month later further reductions 11 9 were achieved when restrictions were increased to level 3b and letters were sent to households consuming more than 50 kl because the effects of the level 4 restrictions including a ban on all outdoor water use introduced in the winter of june 2017 would only be visible in the summer months from september 2017 onwards the relation between water reductions and subsequent drought measures implemented in the summer may be overstated usage dropped remarkably particularly between september and october 2017 the average household usage was 14 3 17 2 lower than the constructed water use comparison for those months key interventions during this time along with the level 5 restrictions were the water management devices and the disaster plan that raised the specter of dry taps and water having to be fetched from collection points usage decreased drastically after the city of cape town announced the disaster plan 42 which was widely discussed in the local media and among cape townians the largest water use reduction 24 3 was achieved in january 2018 with the introduction of level 6 45 the announcement that day zero might arrive on april 22 increased pressure management and the launch of the city water map drought related campaigns have previously been shown to reduce water usage between 15 and 28 during times of extreme water scarcity 24 28 given the media hype around the city of cape town s interventions at this point people were much more alert to changes in regulations than normally the restriction to 50 l of water per person per day that was announced with level 6b in february 2018 was much lower than any usage targets that have been set in other drought afflicted cities at this point cape town residents were also looking at the interventions as a signal of how dire the water supply situation was when tariffs were increased exponentially and day zero became increasingly inevitable a further 20 1 reduction was achieved once day zero was cancelled provisionally in march 2018 and ultimately in june 2018 households started to relax their efforts to conserve water at these very low levels of usage the drought measures implemented in cape town appealed to both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations since all households received the same measures at the same time we cannot assess crowding in and crowding out effects for example test if price increases crowded out household s willingness to voluntarily reduce their water use we do however find that water prices were relatively modest for most part of the drought large tariff increases only happened towards the height of the drought jack et al 2019 46 found that tariffs were not a strong motivating factor for high income households who consumed in the higher tariff blocks before the drought to reduce their water usage higher income households indicated that they were more motivated by social pressure and civic duty than by price results from brick et al 2018 37 further showed that the treatment effect of the behavioural nudges persisted in the long term and that the treatment effect was not crowed out by water use restrictions and tariff increases which were implemented subsequently 6 conclusion during cape town s extremely severe 2016 2018 drought dam levels dropped to unprecedented lows the local municipality urged residents to take drastic measures to reduce water usage all the way down to 50 l per person per day the lowest target ever set during a drought but in line with the who s minimum level of water needed to maintain health and safety standards against a background of growing worldwide concern about water scarcity this analysis looked at how cape town avoided day zero we examined the relation of water use reductions and four kinds of drought measures tariff increases restrictions water pressure reduction and public information and education campaigns as the drought escalated into a crisis we used monthly household water use data over a period of four years june 2014 to may 2018 we used the month to month fluctuations in water use during the pre drought year june 2014 to may 2015 to calculate a normal trend percentage increase decrease of water use we superimposed this trend on each drought month m 1 to obtain a water use comparison in the subsequent drought month m we then compared water use in each drought month to the constructed comparison value and aligned it with the drought measures that were phased in at that time we presume that the impact of interventions implemented prior to the one we are evaluating will be netted out using this method in contrast a direct comparison with the pre drought year would have inflated the impact of measures that were implemented later in the drought because it would not consider the demand reduction achieved by prior instruments we do acknowledge that it is possible that our estimates of the relation of water use reductions and drought measures can be exaggerated if impacts from previous interventions are delayed although this would bias our estimations upwards it is still possible to get a sense for which interventions were more impactful than others given the salience around interventions during the drought we expect consumers to have been responsive in the short run especially at the height of the drought where more than one intervention was leveraged in the same month e g a tariff increase and a restriction level increase we can only talk about the correlation of water usage reductions and intervention packages messages targeting outdoor water usage in the summer months were strongly related to drastic reductions in water demand threatening non compliant households with a water demand management meter and revealing that residents could have to collect their daily water allocation across the city were also related to large water reductions these findings are supported by booysen et al 2019 using smart water meter data 42 the largest reductions 20 1 24 3 reduction were achieved when day zero appeared increasingly unavoidable tariff hikes were introduced water usage was restricted to 50 l per capita per day and water pressure was reduced the beginning of 2018 also saw a dramatic shift in how the city handled communication with citizens towards a much more open and clear sharing of available information on various platforms such as the water dashboard at the same time the city raised the alarm and shifted responsibility for averting the crisis onto residents failure to provide adequate information in a timely manner can lead to rumors and speculation undermining trust in the government and creating conflicts in society 6 cape town s experience highlights the importance of providing information about the city s response and strategy in terms of water augmentation and demand management earlier on to win public engagement and to build public trust a water crisis happening in the context of extreme inequality such as in cape town raises the question of how the various income groups dealt with the water crisis the more affluent residents found their own private ways to be less reliant on municipal water through investments in alternative water supply such as rainwater tanks boreholes well points and bottled water inevitably this raises fairness and justice issues that could be explored in future research credit author statement johanna brühl conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation writing martine visser conceptualization

8674,in the 2016 2018 drought cape town almost ran out of municipal water tariff increases restrictions and campaigns brought big reductions in water use during the dry spring and summer months 14 3 in september 2017 when non compliant households were threatened with a water usage restriction meter 17 2 in october when a disaster plan threatened residents with collecting water daily at 200 points across the city and 20 1 24 3 when day zero appeared unavoidable water pressure was reduced usage was restricted to 50 l per person per day and exponential tariff hikes were introduced transparent information about the severity of the crisis and shifting the responsibility for crisis avoidance to residents amplified water savings at the height of the drought keywords water demand management water conservation drought 1 introduction from 2016 to 2018 cape town south africa suffered what was widely claimed to be the worst drought in 100 years and came dramatically close to running out of municipal water people began to talk about day zero the day that cape town s taps would run dry and residents would have to collect a daily allocation of 25 l of water at communal water points across the city cape town s predicament caused public panic and drew the attention of international media at the height of the crisis 1 the city of cape town hiked the water tariffs repeatedly imposed drastic restrictions on water usage reduced the water pressure and released media campaigns urging people to save water the result was a 50 water usage decrease in less than three years fig 1 up to may 2015 before the drought average households in freestanding houses with a private water connection were using 183l per person per day in 2018 this dropped to 84l per person per day a dramatic reduction of 54 in contrast during the 2003 2008 millennium drought in southeast queensland australia usage was 129l per person per day compared to 375l under non drought conditions 2 and in california in 2015 during the 2012 2016 drought usage was 242l 146 gallons per person per day 3 cape town has a mediterranean climate with most of the annual rainfall in winter the city s water supply system is 88 dependent on rainfall and 12 on augmentation from groundwater 4 in 2017 after the june to august rains the dam levels were at 32 a big drop from the 58 in 2016 fig 2 aggravating the water problem cape town s population increased by 46 in just 15 years 1996 2011 5 and the city s strategy to cope with this primarily relied on water conservation and demand side management to curb usage as opposed to investment in new supply sources 6 despite the population growth however until the drought water demand had remained steady since 2000 in this paper we review water usage patterns and the four measures the city applied to drastically reduce usage increased tariffs usage restrictions pressure reductions and information campaigns fig 3 our sample was drawn from a municipal utilities database of around 300 000 domestic freestanding households in the city of cape town we used a panel of monthly household usage over a period of four years june 2014 to may 2018 we used the month to month fluctuations in water use during the pre drought year june 2014 to may 2015 to calculate a normal trend percentage increase decrease of water use we superimposed this trend on each drought month m 1 to obtain a water use comparison in the subsequent drought month m this allowed us to capture changes in consumption for a drought month that depart from any normal changes seasonal fluctuation that would be expected during a non drought year at the beginning of the drought water use reductions were likely the result of specific interventions that were implemented individually however the correlation of water usage reductions and drought interventions may be exaggerated in cases where an intervention did not influence water use immediately but took longer to take effect in months where interventions were bundled we can only talk about the correlation of water usage reductions and drought intervention packages 2 literature to reduce water demand to align with available supply in times of water scarcity policy makers can apply increasingly stringent price based or non price based demand side measures 7 price based measures directly target the consumer s pocket via water tariffs non price based measures target behavior for example via water restrictions that limit irrigation or total daily household usage often with penalties in case of non compliance or via public information and education campaigns to encourage voluntary savings 8 9 both types are discussed below tariff increases several studies have shown only a moderate effect of tariff hikes on water usage they show that as residential water demand is inelastic with price elasticities between 0 1 and 0 3 a 10 increase in price would reduce demand for water by 1 to 3 9 13 jansen and schulz 2006 14 found that in cape town where high levels of inequality prevail high income households with a price elasticity of 0 97 are more price sensitive than low income households with a price elasticity of 0 32 however those studies were not done during a major drought like cape town s where percentage increases in price were very large towards the end of the drought after a tariff increase usage is reduced not immediately but gradually as people adopt water efficient equipment and change their water use habits 7 martínez espineira and nauges 2004 15 found that the amount of water usage that is non responsive to price changes i e water used for basic needs in the short run is around 3 kl per person per month note that the amount of water these authors describe as basic needs is much higher than the 25 l p d that the who and un say is necessary for essential hygiene and basic food needs they suggest that once such low levels of usage are achieved information campaigns should be launched or water efficient appliances promoted to achieve further reductions towards the end of the cape town drought residents were consuming much less than 3 kl per person per month and indeed a combination of measures were used to further reduce consumption water restrictions studies of the impact of restrictions on residential water usage during a drought found average reductions of between 16 and 28 7 9 16 19 during the 2000 2010 california drought los angeles started water conservation interventions with voluntary measures in june 2007 residents were asked to reduce usage by 10 in august 2008 mandatory restrictions on irrigation were introduced in june 2009 washing of vehicles and filling of pools were prohibited and the second tier water price was increased by 44 19 cape town s water conservation measures were much more stringent 10 reductions were aimed at from the start january 2016 and usage was restricted even further as the drought escalated mini et al 2014 19 assessed the effectiveness of different levels of restrictions on reducing water usage in single family households in california from 2008 to 2010 comparing predicted to actual usage they found that voluntary restrictions did not lead households to reduce their usage significantly whereas mandatory restrictions in combination with a tariff increase brought a 23 decline in usage during an earlier drought in california 1985 1992 the mandatory water allocation policy that was introduced in goleta in july 1989 with high penalties for exceeding the household allocation reduced average residential water demand by 28 and the banning of all irrigation in santa barbara reduced the demand by 16 7 pressure reductions reducing water pressure by installing pressure reducing valves can drastically decrease water loss from leaking pipes and plumbing fittings especially during times of low usage 20 during the millennium drought in australia investments in leakages and pressure management programs were made to increase water efficiency turner et al 2016 21 report that the public interest in saving water during the drought further increased the reporting of leaks and response times such programs were much less costly than expanding water supply infrastructure in sydney one third of all households were part of the waterfix program 1999 2011 which included household water audits and retrofit programs the program costed usd 53 m aud 73 m and is reported to have saved over 10 100 ml a by 2011 savings per household were 21 kl a 22 another pressure and leak management program on the gold coast in australia was estimated to save 26 ml day 9 490 ml a if implemented citywide 23 public information and education campaigns water saving campaigns are commonly used during water stressed periods to curb demand in the short term and have shown reductions of between 11 and 28 24 29 campaigns to raise public awareness and promote behavioral change can help to avoid the necessity for other measures such as price increases and are therefore politically acceptable but doubts remain regarding their cost effectiveness and potential to effect long term change 8 studies mainly assess the impact of campaigns through narrative reviews or statistical analysis such as regressions 24 28 during the 2005 2015 drought in california s san francisco bay area quesnel and ajami 2017 29 analyzed the link between increased media attention to a drought and household water conservation levels their assessment of news media coverage showed that an increase of 100 drought related media articles was associated with a water usage reduction of 11 18 previous studies have mostly concentrated on one type of water demand management intervention and have not covered several types in one analysis the variety of increasingly restrictive measures implemented during the cape town drought is unusual and they were also much more stringent than drought measures analyzed in previous studies outdoor usage is commonly restricted during water supply shortages but in cape town indoor water usage was also restricted to 50 l p d at the height of the drought the cape town campaigns were multi faceted and went further than the traditional public information campaigns and news articles that previous studies have investigated they provided more transparent information and even reprimanded high water users for their excessive consumption 3 methods we analyzed the correlation of water usage reductions and the various measures that were implemented as cape town s drought escalated towards a crisis we used a municipal utilities database to collect a panel of monthly usage by around 300 000 domestic freestanding households in the city over a four year period june 2014 to may 2018 ideally we would have liked to use a difference in differences design where water use is observed for two groups treatment and control for two periods pre and post the treatment group would be exposed to a drought intervention in the post period but not in the pre period the control group would not be exposed to any drought intervention in any period we could then compare the before after change in the treated households with the before after change in the control households to tease out the effect of the drought interventions such an approach was infeasible because all households in cape town faced the same levels of water use restrictions tariff rate increases and conservation campaigns at the same time another approach could have been to use a simple before after design however since many interventions occurred over the period from may 2015 to may 2018 a before after design would lead us to measure the impact of all the interventions leveraged through the drought household water use reduced more than 50 between may 2015 and may 2018 it would not be possible to establish any kind of relationship between reduction in water use and exposure to drought interventions at different points in time as more and more measures were implemented as the drought escalated for each drought intervention we ideally want to exclude the impact of previous interventions as far as possible and look at the impact of the most immediate interventions at different points in time a water use comparison value in any drought month is calibrated from the preceding month in the drought we want to know what water use in a drought month would have looked like if no intervention had occurred to get this water use comparison we use the month to month fluctuations in water use during the pre drought year june 2014 to may 2015 to calculate a normal percentage increase decrease of water use we superimpose this trend on each drought month m 1 to obtain a water use comparison in the subsequent drought month m this allows us to capture changes in consumption for a drought month that departs from any normal changes seasonal fluctuation that would be expected during a non drought year we used this specific non drought period 2014 15 to construct the water use comparison value because no strong restrictions or unusual tariff increases were implemented during that time we calculated the water use comparison values in the following way w a t e r u s e c o m p a r i s o n d r o u g h t m u s a g e d r o u g h t m 1 u s a g e p r e d r o u g h t m u s a g e p r e d r o u g h t m 1 where u s a g e d r o u g h t m 1 is the average water usage in the previous month in the drought period u s a g e p r e d r o u g h t m the average usage in a month in the pre drought period and u s a g e p r e d r o u g h t m 1 the average usage in the previous month in the pre drought period where a household s data were missing we imputed the data from the average water usage in that suburb and tariff block for example usage was 0 535 kl in september 2014 and 0 603 kl in october 2014 an increase of 13 usage in september 2016 was 0 478 kl on the assumption that usage patterns in 2016 would match those of the pre drought year we would expect again to see a 13 increase from september to october usage in october 2016 would then be 0 540 kl but in fact it was 0 503 kl 7 lower than expected comparing water use in each drought month to its constructed comparison value we could align it as closely as possible with the measures that were phased in during the drought we used the following regression framework to determine the difference between actual water use and the constructed comparison value in the drought period y i β 0 β 1 a c t u a l d u m m y i β 2 x i ε i where y i is actual water use or the constructed comparison value a c t u a l d u m m y i is equal to 1 for actual water usage and 0 for the constructed water use comparison x i is a vector of controls including property values as a proxy for household income suburb and an indicator for indigent status households that are part of the indigent support program receive access to affordable basic municipal services water refuse removal electricity and property rates depending on their property value and monthly income households are either automatically classified as indigent or can apply for indigent status separate regressions were run for each month in each month there is one true observation for each household and one constructed comparison observation the average sample size per month is approximately 600 000 account numbers we are interested in the coefficient β 1 which gives the difference between actual water use and the constructed comparison value i e the effect of the combined drought interventions that were implemented at a certain point during the drought if we see a change in water usage at this point in time we associate the changes with the interventions that were phased in over this period we used a robust regression method to control for heteroscedasticity and outliers for our analysis we used the year 2014 15 as pre drought period water use in cape town is strongly seasonal and we assumed that this water use pattern high water use in the south african summer months low water use during the winter season would continue throughout the drought our approach does not take into account any temporal changes that would have taken place independent of interventions i e we assume that there were no time trends that would have distorted the results we further assume that we have taken all public initiatives and policies into account that were implemented over the drought it is however possible that we have missed some smaller less known interventions an important point to raise here is that if we used the pre drought water use only to calculate the water use comparison we would overestimate the impact restrictions towards the middle and end of the drought had because we would not consider usage reductions that were achieved by previous interventions we therefore look at different points in time during the drought and the number of interventions that were rolled out individually or in combination at that time we make the presumption that interventions are most likely to influence water use in the following month due to the severity of the drought changes in tariffs and restriction levels were much more discussed than during normal times on a variety of media platforms given the media hype around the city of cape town s interventions there generally was high public alert to the drought measures the city of cape town registered increased website traffic on their homepage multiple billboards on the side of the roads announced increases in restriction levels journalists extensively covered restriction level changes and announcements that were made by the city residents discussed restriction levels and shared water saving tips on social media hence it was more likely that households would have responded in the short run rather than long run in this case we look at the behavioral response to an intervention in any two consecutive months of the drought year here are the implications of four different scenarios i when only one intervention was implemented in a given month and no other interventions were implemented in the few months prior water use reductions are likely the result of this intervention ii a drought intervention may affect water use for several months for example a water use restriction implemented on the 1st of january could be related to a 5 decrease in water use which is maintained if a campaign is launched a few months later for example on the 1st of april the april coefficient indicates the additional reduction that is likely related to the campaign iii where an intervention did not influence water use immediately it would lead us to overestimate the relation of water use reductions and subsequent interventions we did however expect responses to drought interventions to be immediate due to the level of public awareness during this time although this would bias our estimations upwards it is still possible to get a sense for which drought measures were more impactful than others iv if two or more interventions were launched in the same month we can only talk about the correlation of water usage reductions and intervention packages 4 measures tariffs were increased throughout the drought especially for consumers of greater volumes of water tariff increases were often implemented in combination with water usage restrictions water pressure was also reduced across the city information and education campaigns via the media were used to impress on residents the urgency of the situation ways to save water were explained with some campaigns specifically targeting high user households to encourage them to change their behavior immediately fig 3 shows an overview of the measures implemented over the drought period and the corresponding water usage reductions 4 1 tariff increases cape town s water tariffs have historically been low even insufficient to cover operating and maintenance costs 4 from the beginning of 2015 to mid 2017 consumers paid between r39 us 2 6 and r65 us 4 3 for 10 5 kl per month pricing is calculated on an increasing block tariff ibt structure consisting of six tariff blocks with an increase in each subsequent block table 1 in line with the south african constitution s requirement that all citizens must have access to basic services water in the first block up to 6 kl per month was provided for free regardless of household size or monthly income from the introduction of the free basic water policy in 2001 until july 2017 when this was restricted to indigent households only by july 2017 in response to the call to reduce usage 89 of households were consuming less than 20 kl per month leaving the municipality very little revenue at higher tariff blocks that could be used to subsidize the indigent and still pay for infrastructure and service delivery water prices were very high in the upper tariff blocks at the height of the water crisis but only a handful of households were consuming in tariff blocks 5 and 6 after january 2018 average water usage by the city went down by 45 in one year from 900 million liters per day in february 2017 to 500 million liters per day in february 2018 since this had severe knock on effects on the financial viability of the water services tariffs were increased substantially in february 2018 to increase revenue generation not just to restrict demand table 1 shows the tariff increases that were phased in over three years as the drought progressed in january 2016 level 2 water restrictions were introduced in combination with an increase in tariffs with the aim of reducing usage by 10 the increases were larger than they had been historically for the higher tariff blocks table 1 panel a the next tariff increase in july 2016 raised tariffs by a further 5 panel b the level 3 restrictions in december 2016 aiming to reduce demand by a further 20 increased tariffs by 8 the increases were particularly large for tariff block 6 30 the level 4b restrictions in july 2017 were accompanied by the cancellation of the free basic water policy for all households not part of the indigent support program in february 2018 with level 6b restrictions and repeated warnings of the imminence of day zero the biggest tariff increase was phased in and prices went up by 175 31 during most of cape town s water crisis prices stayed comparatively low before july 2017 10 5 kl per month cost r40 to r65 us 2 6 to us 4 3 in july 2017 the price of 10 5 kl per month increased to r94 us 6 2 in february 2018 the price of 10 5 kl per month increased to r365 us 24 to put cape town s water prices in perspective we note that in san francisco from 2010 to 2017 prices increased by between 119 and 127 meaning that for a four person household using 189 l 50 gallons per person per day or around 23 kl per month the price went up from us 31 r472 to us 67 r1019 32 before july 2017 23 kl per month cost r214 to r370 us 14 to us 24 while by february 2018 this had increased to r2215 us 146 in the lowest tariff bracket of 6 kl per month a usage level that many households even in the more affluent areas had reduced to at the height of the crisis prices stayed low 6 kl was free for all consumers until july 2017 increasing to r24 us 1 6 in july 2017 and to r158 us 10 in february 2018 4 2 restrictions at the beginning of the drought during the south african summer months restrictions were placed on outdoor water usage but as the drought escalated the municipality also restricted total daily household usage level 2 restrictions set specific days and times when municipal water could be used to water gardens levels 3 and 3b banned the use of hosepipes or irrigation systems and advised people to use a bucket or watering can to water the garden or wash the car 33 spot fines could be issued by water inspectors if residents did not obey the rules for outdoor water usage in june 2017 level 4 restrictions limited all water usage to 100 l per person per day effectively now including indoor water usage in the restrictions level 4 restrictions also prohibited the filling or topping up of swimming pools with municipal water and did not allow the washing of vehicles level 4b reduced the daily usage limit further to 87 l per person in september 2017 with level 5 restrictions 87 l p d but 20 kl h m the city started installing water management devices in non compliant households in an effort to enforce the restrictions high usage households were first issued with a warning letter telling them they were disobeying the restrictions they could be required to appear in court and as a result receive a fine or have a device installed the fine would be reissued every month that a household used above the limit in january 2018 level 6 restricted monthly water usage to 10 5 kl per household and level 6b reduced the limit to 50 l per person per day a month later 4 3 water pressure reductions to achieve further water savings water pressure reductions were scaled up during the drought water pressure management had been implemented across the city over a decade ago as part of the city s water demand management strategy pressure reducing valves in the water supply system made it possible to throttle pressure in specific supply zones at certain times pressure reductions were achieved particularly in the cape flats a low income area southeast of central cape town to decrease water loss from main pipe bursts and leaks in household pipes and plumbing fittings 20 when level 2 restrictions were introduced consumers were warned of the possibility of pressure reductions 34 media campaigns also told people how to reduce the flow of water from the municipal system to their households using a stopcock intense pressure management was announced and accelerated at the end of 2017 the south african summer and dry season in cape town and started to take effect in january and february 2018 at the height of the drought the aim was to establish new pressure management zones and to better manage the existing zones 35 while it is well known that pressure management reduces water loss for example from burst main pipes the link between water pressure and household water usage is not as well established a recent study in gauteng south africa 36 found that pressure changes have little effect on household usage partly because households already have pressure reducing valves installed commonly in the water heater 4 4 campaigns campaigns during the cape town drought aimed to raise awareness of the seriousness of the drought so people would change their behavior they provided transparent information about the state of the water supply and water demand situation the city of cape town also used shaming techniques to persuade extremely high water users to reduce their monthly usage in the beginning of the drought from november 2015 to may 2016 the city tested a variety of behavioral nudges to encourage cape town residents to use water more sparingly 37 brick et al 2018 find average water use reductions of 0 6 1 3 the most effective nudges were the ones officially recognizing household s conservation efforts and nudges asking households to save water because it is in the public interest wealthier households were particularly responsive to nudges framed around social incentives as the drought worsened and the target of 700 million liters of collective use per day had not been reached to drive home the need for radical behavioral change the city changed from the carrot to the stick approach and published a list of the top 100 water users divulged only by street names at the end of february 2017 38 at the same time the city sent letters to high water users monthly water use 50 kl in the letter high users were compared to the average cape town household they were reprimanded for excessive water use and threatened with the installation of a water restricting device high water consumers were further given information about the severity of the drought and ways to cut their consumption brühl serman and visser 2020 show that the letter significantly reduced water use in the short term a few months later on may 22 2017 the western cape was declared a disaster area 39 on august 17 2017 the mayor announced cape town s water resilience plan which included water augmentation plans including desalination plants and groundwater extraction to obtain an additional 500 million liters of water per day and water demand management plans including further restrictions pressure management and installation of water management devices in high usage households 40 next the three phased critical water shortages disaster plan 41 announced on october 1 2017 that cape town residents could be collecting their daily allocation of drinking water at 200 collection points across the city manned by police and army these announcements were followed by a flurry of alarmist media activity which grabbed the attention of most capetonians 42 in the following months the city aimed for greater transparency and public trust by sharing more detailed and timely information about the water crisis and the city s plans to manage it various interventions were launched such as the water dashboard which gave weekly updates about total water usage in cape town the city s augmentation plans the dam levels and the approaching day zero date 43 the mayor s prediction that april 21 would be day zero hit the local and international press on january 18 2018 this was probably the turning point in the water saving campaign as it brought home to residents the imminence of the crisis responsibility for avoiding day zero was shifted from the city onto residents who were asked to reduce usage still further in the same month the city launched the water map a website showing all the freestanding residential households that were complying with the water restrictions 44 the aim was to show residents how well their neighborhood was complying and to motivate them to reduce usage even further 5 water use reductions and drought measures fig 4 shows that water usage was much lower than expected throughout the drought particularly in the dry summer months around january seasonal variation in usage was much less marked than usual it was still visible in 2016 but almost non existent from 2017 to the beginning of 2018 table 2 shows the results of comparing each month s actual water usage to its constructed water use comparison values if the coefficient β 1 shows a decrease increase in water use in any given month we attribute the decrease increase to the intervention or the bundle of interventions that were introduced in that month at the beginning of the drought when interventions were only implemented every few months water use reductions were likely the result of specific interventions however towards the height of the drought interventions were implemented together or in close succession in this case we can only talk about the correlation of water usage reductions and drought intervention packages reductions of on average 11 5 to 8 7 were achieved when level 3 restrictions were introduced which allowed households to water their garden only using a bucket in combination with a tariff increase a month later further reductions 11 9 were achieved when restrictions were increased to level 3b and letters were sent to households consuming more than 50 kl because the effects of the level 4 restrictions including a ban on all outdoor water use introduced in the winter of june 2017 would only be visible in the summer months from september 2017 onwards the relation between water reductions and subsequent drought measures implemented in the summer may be overstated usage dropped remarkably particularly between september and october 2017 the average household usage was 14 3 17 2 lower than the constructed water use comparison for those months key interventions during this time along with the level 5 restrictions were the water management devices and the disaster plan that raised the specter of dry taps and water having to be fetched from collection points usage decreased drastically after the city of cape town announced the disaster plan 42 which was widely discussed in the local media and among cape townians the largest water use reduction 24 3 was achieved in january 2018 with the introduction of level 6 45 the announcement that day zero might arrive on april 22 increased pressure management and the launch of the city water map drought related campaigns have previously been shown to reduce water usage between 15 and 28 during times of extreme water scarcity 24 28 given the media hype around the city of cape town s interventions at this point people were much more alert to changes in regulations than normally the restriction to 50 l of water per person per day that was announced with level 6b in february 2018 was much lower than any usage targets that have been set in other drought afflicted cities at this point cape town residents were also looking at the interventions as a signal of how dire the water supply situation was when tariffs were increased exponentially and day zero became increasingly inevitable a further 20 1 reduction was achieved once day zero was cancelled provisionally in march 2018 and ultimately in june 2018 households started to relax their efforts to conserve water at these very low levels of usage the drought measures implemented in cape town appealed to both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations since all households received the same measures at the same time we cannot assess crowding in and crowding out effects for example test if price increases crowded out household s willingness to voluntarily reduce their water use we do however find that water prices were relatively modest for most part of the drought large tariff increases only happened towards the height of the drought jack et al 2019 46 found that tariffs were not a strong motivating factor for high income households who consumed in the higher tariff blocks before the drought to reduce their water usage higher income households indicated that they were more motivated by social pressure and civic duty than by price results from brick et al 2018 37 further showed that the treatment effect of the behavioural nudges persisted in the long term and that the treatment effect was not crowed out by water use restrictions and tariff increases which were implemented subsequently 6 conclusion during cape town s extremely severe 2016 2018 drought dam levels dropped to unprecedented lows the local municipality urged residents to take drastic measures to reduce water usage all the way down to 50 l per person per day the lowest target ever set during a drought but in line with the who s minimum level of water needed to maintain health and safety standards against a background of growing worldwide concern about water scarcity this analysis looked at how cape town avoided day zero we examined the relation of water use reductions and four kinds of drought measures tariff increases restrictions water pressure reduction and public information and education campaigns as the drought escalated into a crisis we used monthly household water use data over a period of four years june 2014 to may 2018 we used the month to month fluctuations in water use during the pre drought year june 2014 to may 2015 to calculate a normal trend percentage increase decrease of water use we superimposed this trend on each drought month m 1 to obtain a water use comparison in the subsequent drought month m we then compared water use in each drought month to the constructed comparison value and aligned it with the drought measures that were phased in at that time we presume that the impact of interventions implemented prior to the one we are evaluating will be netted out using this method in contrast a direct comparison with the pre drought year would have inflated the impact of measures that were implemented later in the drought because it would not consider the demand reduction achieved by prior instruments we do acknowledge that it is possible that our estimates of the relation of water use reductions and drought measures can be exaggerated if impacts from previous interventions are delayed although this would bias our estimations upwards it is still possible to get a sense for which interventions were more impactful than others given the salience around interventions during the drought we expect consumers to have been responsive in the short run especially at the height of the drought where more than one intervention was leveraged in the same month e g a tariff increase and a restriction level increase we can only talk about the correlation of water usage reductions and intervention packages messages targeting outdoor water usage in the summer months were strongly related to drastic reductions in water demand threatening non compliant households with a water demand management meter and revealing that residents could have to collect their daily water allocation across the city were also related to large water reductions these findings are supported by booysen et al 2019 using smart water meter data 42 the largest reductions 20 1 24 3 reduction were achieved when day zero appeared increasingly unavoidable tariff hikes were introduced water usage was restricted to 50 l per capita per day and water pressure was reduced the beginning of 2018 also saw a dramatic shift in how the city handled communication with citizens towards a much more open and clear sharing of available information on various platforms such as the water dashboard at the same time the city raised the alarm and shifted responsibility for averting the crisis onto residents failure to provide adequate information in a timely manner can lead to rumors and speculation undermining trust in the government and creating conflicts in society 6 cape town s experience highlights the importance of providing information about the city s response and strategy in terms of water augmentation and demand management earlier on to win public engagement and to build public trust a water crisis happening in the context of extreme inequality such as in cape town raises the question of how the various income groups dealt with the water crisis the more affluent residents found their own private ways to be less reliant on municipal water through investments in alternative water supply such as rainwater tanks boreholes well points and bottled water inevitably this raises fairness and justice issues that could be explored in future research credit author statement johanna brühl conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation writing martine visser conceptualization
