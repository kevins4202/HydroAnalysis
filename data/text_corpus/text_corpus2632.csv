13160,since 2021 national standards of south korea for industrial wastewater discharge to surface water have changed from chemical oxygen demand to total organic carbon for the organic matter conventional organic matter parameters e g biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon are limited means of understanding the behavior of dissolved organic matter in industrial wastewater treatment processes thus the current study used advanced dissolved organic matter characterization tools e g fluorescence excitation emission matrix and size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection to scrutinize industrial wastewater characteristics from three full scale industrial wastewater treatment plants iwtps the tools were conducive to tracking industrial wastewater sources of total organic carbon influencing the overall performance of iwtps and proposing alternative processes to lower total organic carbon concentration in the effluent the results of this study suggest that the diagnosis of iwtps based on dissolved organic matter characteristics could be a useful tool for providing more insight into total organic carbon management graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chemical oxygen demand discharge standards industrial wastewater total organic carbon 1 introduction industrial activities have diversified and expanded resulting in a large increase of hazardous waste including non biodegradable and toxic compounds in industrial wastewater that are difficult to attenuate organic matter is the most relevant cause of water pollution particularly dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater systems either consumes dissolved oxygen do or deteriorates water quality in aquatic environments therefore wastewater needs to be adequately treated before discharge into water bodies over the years biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod have been widely used and regarded as important environmental indicators of organic matter present in wastewater matrices fig 1 shows a chronological representation of the parameters of organic matter that have been used in south korea for the management of organic matter in rivers and municipal and industrial wastewaters 23 36 cod can be a relatively precise indicator that uses strong chemical oxidants and it can be used to determine the oxidation state of organic substances 18 however some disadvantages of using cod include the presence of disruptive inorganic compounds that evoke measurement errors and thereby low reproducibility 2 and the production of hazardous wastes such as hg ii and cr vi 17 codmn was included in wastewater discharge standards in south korea because of its low empirical oxidation rate of approximately 30 60 codmn cannot determine the compounds that are difficult to degrade as accurately as codcr 21 accordingly there has been an ongoing discussion on the management of refractory organic matter in wastewater treatment as a result total organic carbon toc has received much attention as a substitute for cod 17 codmn which has been used in wastewater effluent standards in south korea since 1981 was replaced with toc in 2020 in the case of public industrial wastewater treatment plants iwtps simultaneously receiving domestic wastewater and various types of industrial wastewater and will be completely phased out by 2022 in the case of private iwtps 36 the fundamental motivation behind the introduction of the new policy arose from the need to minimize the amount of recalcitrant organic compounds in water bodies therefore the ministry of environment in south korea has been aiming to decrease the toc concentration of industrial wastewater effluent entering into receiving water bodies toc is an index that can quantify a wide range of organic matter by measuring the amount of carbon dioxide generated by directly oxidizing organic substances specifically toc is a method that directly measures the amount of carbon thus it can not only accurately quantify the amount of organic substances in the water body but can also possibly reduce any measurement errors that may occur in cod estimation therefore organic matter that was not detected through cod may be reflected in toc thus toc has been regarded as an alternative analytical method for the detection of non degradable organic substances in water samples 34 the specific advantages of toc over cod analytical methods may include i lower time consumption required for analysis 6 ii avoidance of the use of toxic chemical reagents and thereby lower production of residual by products that need to be disposed of after analytical determinations 2 and iii automatic measurement with a small number of samples 34 in addition toc aids the detection of refractory organic matter containing more complex materials that is normally observed in industrial wastewater 11 it is necessary to prepare toc management plans for iwtps that are facing difficulties in meeting the new industrial wastewater effluent guidelines which are national regulatory standards for industrial wastewater discharge into surface water specifically the suggested codmn toc ratios for public iwtps and private iwtps are 1 3 and 1 8 respectively 36 however there are some public and private iwtps where the ratios are lower than the specified ratios this can occur because the determination of codmn in the effluent can lead to a relatively lower amount of organic carbon specifically the organic matter is characterized by refractory compounds resulting in underestimation of codmn the organic matter loading in public iwtps is directly affected by the effluent toc discharged from industrial facilities located within the wastewater treatment area therefore the effluent toc of public iwtps should be managed through appropriate reduction of the influent sources to meet the toc standards thus it is essential to investigate the source of non biodegradable organic matter which affects the overall performance of toc removal in public iwtps the conventional organic matter parameters of bod and cod as well as toc itself may provide limited information on aspects such as the biodegradability of industrial wastewater effluent through bod toc or bod cod ratios further specific information on the components or characteristics of organic matter i e composition and structure hydrophilicity hydrophobicity aromaticity and molecular weight distribution in industrial wastewater may be useful for the enhancement of the performance of treatment plants dom characterization was utilized to overcome the current limitations imposed by conventional global parameters specific ultraviolet absorbance suva which is determined by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 by the dissolved organic carbon doc of a sample can explain the aromaticity of wastewater samples 2 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem explains the dom characteristics by showing several well known fluorescence peaks t1 t2 a b and c 27 liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd can provide apparent molecular weight distribution of doc in wastewater samples 8 compared to conventional organic matter parameters the bulk organic matter characterization parameters are characterized by relatively fast analysis with little preparation and fewer samples in particular the benefits of feem are that it is i highly sensitive non destructive and non invasive ii reagentless and iii inexpensive thus it can provide prompt feedback for the characterization of wastewater samples 9 based on this advanced organic matter characterization tools can be used to track influent sources influencing the public iwtps and to identify alternative processes to reduce toc concentration in iwtp effluents to date an increasing number of researchers have focused on characterizing organic matter in industrial wastewater using advanced organic matter characterization tools however the application of analytical technology in industrial environments remains challenging in the context of the overall toc management of iwtps in this study three iwtps were investigated using advanced organic matter characterization tools and conventional organic matter parameters the objectives of the study were twofold i to investigate the various influent sources i e either refractory or readily biodegradable affecting a public iwtp and ii to suggest potential processes for iwtps through lab scale experiments based on organic matter compositions 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of research three iwtps that have exceeded the toc standards for effluent discharge were selected one industrial park wastewater treatment plant public iwtp and two private iwtps a paper mill and a rubber plastic producer sampling was carried out from july to october 2020 using the grab sampling method the comprehensive approaches used in this study are presented in fig 2 2 2 characteristics of industrial wastewater treatment plant general information regarding the selected iwtps investigated in this study is tabulated in table 1 each treatment plant was characterized by its wastewater source the public iwtp receives both domestic and industrial wastewaters in particular the public iwtp mainly accepts the following influent categories i basic organic compounds boc such as methyl chloride produced by the processing of coal tar and other mineral tar at high temperatures ii basic inorganic compounds bic including inorganic acids metal and non metal oxides excluding metal oxides for inorganic dyes alkalis and iii byproducts of petroleum refining one of the two private iwtps treats wastewater from paper manufacturing only the other iwtp is characterized by a small scale facility that produces rubber and plastic rp currently biological wastewater treatment using an aerobic activated sludge process is being employed in the three iwtps 2 3 analytical methods the industrial wastewater samples collected from both the public and private iwtps were subjected to various chemical analyses bod5 codmn codcr toc and doc measured with the same sample used for toc but through 0 45 μm filtration using standard methods 24 the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2 adenosine triphosphate atp was employed to evaluate the activity of activated sludge according to the method described by bäckman and gytel 3 the temperature and do of each sample were measured using a do probe do 31p japan the ph was measured using a ph probe hm 30p japan the collected samples were immediately cooled in a cool box the transport time for samples from the iwtps to the laboratory where the chemical analyses and lab scale experiments were conducted was approximately 3 5 h once the samples had arrived at the laboratory they were either immediately analyzed or refrigerated prior to the analysis 24 2 4 bulk organic matter characterization all samples used for analyses in bulk organic matter characterization experiments were filtered through a 0 45 μm polypropylene filter whatman usa the quantification of doc in the wastewater investigated in this study was conducted using a toc analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan and uv254 was measured using a spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa the doc was measured as non purgeable organic carbon doc were determined in triplicate so the average doc concentration was used for the determination of suva254 uv254 measurements deionized water was first placed in a quartz cell with a path length of 1 cm to set a reference i e auto zeroing this was followed by sample measurements based on these two parameters suva254 can be calculated by dividing uv254 by doc indicating the aromaticity of the wastewater samples a spectrofluorometer rf 5301 shimadzu japan with an arc lamp as a light source was used to investigate the fluorescent characteristics of doc in each type of wastewater and consequently to produce three dimensional feem spectra i e contour plots of fluorescence intensities using sigmaplot 12 5 spss inc usa all samples were diluted under 2 mg l of doc to avoid fluorescence quenching 26 feems were measured within the temperature range of 20 25 c 5 the feem were scanned at excitation ex emission em wavelengths of 220 400 nm in 10 nm excitation increments and 280 600 nm in 1 nm emission steps the feem peaks monitored in this study can be classified into two categories protein like peaks b t1 and t2 and humic like peaks a and c specifically the five peak regions observed in our study were as follows protein like peaks t1 tryptophan like ex 220 240 nm em 330 360 nm t2 tryptophan like ex 270 280 nm em 330 360 nm humic like peaks a ex 230 260 nm em 400 450 nm and c ex 300 340 nm em 400 450 nm based on park et al 25 and b tyrosine like ex 220 230 nm em 309 321 nm based on henderson et al 13 to further determine the characteristics of doc in terms of apparent molecular weight distribution size exclusion chromatography was performed using a lc ocd model 8 doc labor germany the lc ocd allows the quantification of doc into five sub fractions biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 20 kda building blocks 350 1000 da low molecular weight lmw acids 350 da and lmw neutrals 350 da 15 it should be noted that the five types of doc fractions mentioned above are classified based on natural organic matter nom therefore all wastewater analyzed in this study was expressed in terms of the molecular weight represented by each type of organic carbon except for the nom based paper mill wastewater 2 5 lab scale of nf membrane experimental set up and procedures the bench scale cross flow filtration unit consisted of an influent tank a high pressure pump and a pressurized chamber where nanofiltration nf was performed the bench scale dead end filtration unit was equipped with two analogue pressure gauges wika germany the cross flow filtration experiment was performed at ambient temperature and 500 kpa using effluent from industrial iwtps that had been pre treated with 1 2 μm filtration to avoid inclusion of large particles the industrially treated effluent stream was introduced into the pressurized chamber through a 10 mm orifice using a high pressure pump hydra cell model number g03eksghfeha wanner engineering inc usa the composite nf permeate obtained over 24 h was collected in a plastic bottle placed on an electronic scale a d model number cb 12 k japan connected to a data acquisition system for continuous monitoring of the flux as a function of time the retentate that did not pass through the membrane was released back into the influent tank the membrane used in this experiment was made of a polyamide fully aromatic polyamide thin film composite ne2521 toray chemical korea inc south korea a flat sheet membrane tailored from the spiral wound membrane element was placed inside the pressurized chamber providing an effective filtration area of 42 5 cm2 the molecular weight cutoff mwco of this membrane was 200 da that is organic carbon having a molecular weight smaller than 200 da could pass through the nanomembrane whereas organic carbon with a molecular weight greater than 200 da was trapped prior to the experiments the membrane was stored in deionized water for at least 24 h to avoid contamination 3 results and discussion for toc management of both public and private iwtps two main approaches were employed based on the effluent toc concentration of each iwtp to investigate the current risk of exceeding the secondary effluent standard of toc various influent sources entering the public iwtp were investigated to determine conventional organic matter parameters i e bod cod and toc as well as dom characterization in the case of individual iwtps a lab scale test was conducted to improve the effluent toc water quality standards a potential alternative process was suggested based on the detailed characteristics of the effluent in this case the problem regarding the effluent toc from each iwtp was first mentioned followed by solutions that could be applied regarding the fractionation of lc ocd when organic matter in wastewater was a substance of natural origin biopolymers humic substances building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals were used however when organic matter was a substance of synthetic or chemical origin the molecular weight range corresponding to each sub fraction of doc was used rather than the conventional term used in lc ocd for nom 3 1 industrial park wastewater treatment plant public iwtp for biological wastewater treatment the public iwtp was operated as de nitrogen and phosphorus denipho process in the bioreactor bod5 was reduced by 92 codmn by 90 and toc by 68 3 the toc concentration of the effluent was 17 6 mg l which met the discharge standard of 25 mg l the bod5 toc of the effluent was 0 03 which indicated significantly low biodegradability 29 in addition the codmn toc which was only used in south korea as a conversion rate from codmn to toc was 0 34 which was lower than the value of 1 3 suggested by the moe of south korea for public iwtps 36 this indicated a large amount of refractory organic matter cannot be determined by cod in the effluent the suva254 of the influent was 0 93 l mg m and it decreased moderately to a value of 0 62 l mg m in the effluent therefore it can be derived that some fractions of aromatic organics were removed similar values have been reported by jin et al 16 who investigated dissolved effluent organic matter from a public iwtp treating mainly domestic wastewater even though the public iwtp met the effluent criteria it indicated low value of codmn toc that is nonbiodegradable organic matter remained in the effluent in this case tracking the causative substance seems to be more appropriate than the implementation of additional processes for the reduction of toc in the effluent to track the influent sources for optimum management of the public iwtp it is essential to characterize the organic substances as illustrated in fig 3 a the public iwtp accepts three main influent sources influent source 1 mainly consists of wastewater from facilities producing boc and bic based on the industry classification list of south korea more than 90 of the wastewater was generated from these two chemical facilities and flowed into the public iwtp influent sources 2 and 3 mainly consist of wastewater discharged from petroleum refining facilities and the chemical industry respectively fig 3 a shows the doc loading rate of each influent source flowing into the public iwtp the doc loads of influent sources 1 2 and 3 were 72 4 kg d 72 7 kg d and 1 3 kg d respectively that is influent sources 1 and 2 accounted for most of the doc load of the public iwtp 99 domestic wastewater generated from a village located within the wastewater treatment area flows into the public iwtp and it accounts for a relatively low proportion 8 on average of the total flow rate generated the loading rates of doc was significantly lower than that of influent 1 2 and 3 therefore it was not considered in the calculation of the doc loading rate as previously described the boc facility a member of influent source 1 considerably affected 95 the doc loading rate of influent source 1 in this study therefore considering the doc load alone it can be observed that the boc facility has a significant influence on the overall doc of the public iwtp however compared to that of public iwtp influents as well as influent sources 2 and 3 the boc facility reported a considerably low suva254 of 0 05 l mg m indicating that the wastewater of the boc facility is relatively non humic 33 in addition the bod5 toc ratio of the boc facility was 1 48 indicating relatively biodegradable organic substances this result is in agreement with the results of a previous study 29 that reported that when the bod5 toc ratio of raw wastewater is 1 2 2 0 it can be regarded as biodegradable organic matter in this regard influent source 1 including the boc facility may not be the main contributor to the increased effluent toc concentration of the public iwtp compared to influent source 1 ultimately boc facility wastewater the suva254 of influent 2 and 3 were 1 13 and 1 49 respectively the bod5 toc of influent 2 and 3 were 1 74 and 0 77 respectively since bod5 toc and toc did not seem to be decisive indicators for determining organic matter characteristics different carbon sources were tracked by lc ocd analysis to investigate the characteristics of dom which helped in understanding the overall performance of the public iwtp fig 3 b shows the fraction of hydrophilic doc compositions and the bod5 toc ratio of each influent source and effluent no precise calculation of mass balance was performed on the loading rates of toc and doc due to the limitations in the availability of data table s2 as shown in fig 3 b five components of each wastewater type were identified by lc ocd the influent and effluent of the public iwtp were mainly composed of neutral organic carbon smaller than 300 da the higher fraction of lmw carbon was attributed to the metabolism of microorganisms that converted large molecular size dom in the influent into relatively lmw organics in the effluent 32 similarly neutral organic carbon 300 da constituted the majority of influent source 1 87 4 in contrast the major constituents of influent sources 2 and 3 were assigned to organic carbon acids 300 da 41 6 and organic carbon 20 kda 57 respectively considering the doc loading rate towards the public iwtp neutral organic carbon 300 da appears to be the key contributor to the doc concentration and therefore accounts for the performance of the public iwtp in the context of decreasing effluent doc and thereby toc concentration the concentration of neutral organic carbon 300 da in the influent and effluent was 30 4 mg l and 15 8 mg l respectively this implies that 52 of neutral organic carbon 300 da was removed during the treatment process most likely through biological treatment in addition the neutral organic carbon 300 da fraction contributed to 84 6 of the doc in the effluent from public iwtp the bod removal rate in the process including primary and secondary treatments was 92 and it was observed that most of the organic matter was biologically removed here a discrepancy was observed in the neutral organic carbon 300 da in the context of biological wastewater treatment specifically the neutral organic carbon 300 da i e lmw neutrals is considered hydrophilic and bioavailable in the context of nom 4 in terms of industrial wastewater the neutral organic carbon 300 da was not different thus the results of this study show that most of the neutral organic carbon 300 da remaining in the effluent would be either biodegradable or slowly biodegradable thereby requiring proper treatment and management as summarized in table s2 the intensity of fluorescence of organic substances of influent source 1 including the boc facility was relatively much lower than that of influent sources 2 and 3 when normalized based on doc concentration that is based on the normalized feem influent sources 2 and 3 showed higher fluorescence intensity than influent source 1 comparing influent sources 1 and 2 with similar doc loading rates the peaks t1 t2 b a and c of influent source 2 were 4 2 4 4 4 2 2 9 and 2 4 times higher than those of influent source 1 respectively table s2 this implies that the influent sources 2 and 3 have a greater influence on the sum of influent entering into the public iwtp and consequently to the overall performance of public iwtp in terms of toc removal than influent source 1 in addition as presented in fig s1 protein like peaks t1 and t2 and tyrosine like peak b were more prevalent than peaks a and c in all influent sources indicating the presence of relatively biodegradable matter this result is in agreement with the results reported by yu et al 35 the suva values of influent sources 2 and 3 were 5 1 and 6 8 times higher than that of influent source 1 respectively indicating the relatively low biodegradability of influent sources 2 and 3 based on our investigations the wastewater discharged from the boc facility is possibly biologically removed and the components of influent sources 2 and 3 characterized by relatively refractory organic matter may remain in the effluent and thereby require additional management of toc finally although the biological treatment of toc was satisfactory to some extent 77 removal rate an improvement in the biological performance of toc removal during the biological treatment process may be required through the alteration of some operating parameters such as solids retention time and mlss concentrations to keep the effluent toc concentration as low as possible 3 2 paper and pulp mill wastewater treatment plant for biological wastewater treatment the paper mill iwtp was operated as unox process utilizing high purity oxygen for aeration the removal efficiencies of bod5 codmn and toc were 94 7 85 2 and 87 6 respectively therefore it can be seen that the bioreactor was being operating stably the toc concentration of the effluent for the paper mill iwtp was 49 5 mg l which did not meet the discharge standard of 40 mg l in addition the codmn toc ratio of the effluent was 1 6 which was lower than the value of 1 8 suggested by the moe of south korea indicating that a moderate amount of non biodegradable organic matter remained in the effluent similarly the bod5 toc value of the effluent from the paper industry was reported to be 0 50 0 75 31 the bod5 toc of the effluent was 0 48 in this study and indicated that some biologically degradable organic matter remained in the effluent which agrees with the fact that the bod5 concentration in the effluent was 23 6 mg l this is relatively high compared to the values reported by eckenfelder 12 the doc toc of the effluent was 88 1 and the suva254 value of the effluent was 2 44 l mg m coagulation aids reduction of the doc when the suva254 was higher than 2 l mg m and the higher the suva254 the higher the humic fractions in the doc 33 because both adsorption and coagulation are favorable for the removal of humics in the doc these can be candidates for the overall reduction of doc and consequently the toc concentration in the effluent however an activated carbon adsorption process was already in operation for the final treatment of wastewater in this iwtp in addition the lc ocd results showed that the organic carbon in the effluent was composed of a hydrophobic fraction 34 7 and a hydrophilic fraction 65 3 specifically the each of hydrophilic doc fraction was as follows biopolymers 12 humic substances 10 7 building blocks 24 9 lmw acids 13 1 and lmw neutrals 39 4 moreover a comparison was made on the results in terms of lc ocd before and after the application of the activated carbon adsorption tank for final discharge the comparison revealed that a minor reduction was observed in building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals with activated carbon adsorption not shown in this paper therefore it was confirmed that lmw organic carbon is hardly removed by the adsorption mechanism which agrees with the results of previous studies 4 to achieve improved toc concentrations a lab scale nf test was conducted land and capital cost restriction in the iwtp informed the selection of nf in addition the nf process would not be used to treat the entire quantity of wastewater for final discharge that is it may be suggested that a part of the effluent is treated with nf and the rest is treated with the existing activated carbon adsorption process so that the two treated effluents are blended and subsequently discharged rather than treating the entire wastewater with the nf process fig 4 shows the individual hydrophilic doc concentrations in treated industrial wastewater and their concentrations after treatment with nf the application of nf molecular weight distribution can provide detailed and useful information on organic matter characteristics as shown in fig 4 the nf performance was successful with a doc removal of 93 when considering the sub fraction of doc the removal efficiencies of biopolymers humic substances building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals were 99 99 96 76 and 93 respectively as expected high molecular weight organic carbon entities such as biopolymers humic substances and building blocks were almost completely removed however contrary to previous observations that lmw neutrals are characterized by low electrostatic repulsion and thereby higher permeability through the nf membrane 22 30 the removal efficiency of lmw neutrals in this study was relatively high 93 since the mwco of the nf membrane was 200 da it seems that the lmw neutrals were occupied with most of the organic carbon with a molecular weight greater than 200 da the nf membrane used in this study was made of polyamide and the surface of the membrane had a positive charge at a low ph and a negative charge at a high ph the ph of the treated industrial wastewater used in this study was 6 85 indicating a very weak acidity i e almost neutral based on the donnan effect 28 considering that the surface charge of lmw acids is negatively charged some lmw acids could pass through the membrane the membrane surface is partially positively charged whereas others were excluded the membrane surface is partially negatively charged as a result the removal rate of lmw acids was lower than that of lmw neutrals lmw neutrals accounted for 50 of the remaining hydrophilic doc in the permeate followed by 38 of lmw acids and 13 of building blocks however each showed a very low value all below 1 mg l additionally the fluorescence characteristics of the paper mill wastewater are displayed in fig s2 fig s2 a and s2 b show the fluorescence properties of the paper mill wastewater before membrane filtration and the permeate after nano membrane filtration respectively the industrially treated effluent fig s2 a was characterized by the presence of three main feem peaks t1 a and c and a less abundant peak t2 in particular peak a was dominant while peak t2 had the lowest intensity in the effluent this result was in agreement with the results of a previous study 27 however rodríguez vidal et al 27 reported that peak c was dominant this could be due to the different features of the pulp used for paper processing and thereby the different wastewater characteristics five feem peaks were detected in the treated effluent these were a b t1 c and t2 in order of intensity in particular four feem peaks a fulvic like c humic like b tyrosine like and t1 tryptophan like were dominant this is in agreement with the findings of a previous study 10 in addition the fact that the largest percentage of fulvic like peak a remained in the effluent is in line with the findings of another recent study 27 although it has been reported that tyrosine like peak b occupies a lower proportion than tryptophan like peak t1 in wastewater 7 the converse was observed in this study with a difference of approximately 10 in addition peaks t1 and b which are protein like peaks can be biologically removed the high intensity of these in the effluent may be related to the relatively high bod concentration of 23 6 mg l that remained in the effluent requiring an improvement in the biological treatment of biodegradable compounds in the aerobic basin in addition the bod removal rate was low 65 in the biological treatment process in the paper mill wastewater with such effluent characteristics a significant reduction in fluorescence intensity 95 was observed for all five peaks through the nf process which is in agreement with the doc removal of 93 in this study therefore the nf membrane process was favorable for the removal of recalcitrant compounds and biodegradable compounds in this wastewater effluent 3 3 rubber and plastic wastewater treatment plant a similar approach was used in the rp iwtp due to footprint limitation in the existing iwtp as well as the treated effluent characteristics based on lc ocd for biological wastewater treatment the rp iwtp was operated as membrane bioreactor mbr process in the mbr the removal efficiencies of bod5 codmn and toc were 79 76 1 and 72 2 respectively since the rp iwtp has operated as mbr equipped with hollow fiber membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 2 μm the nf process was applied to reduce the toc concentration in the effluent the toc concentration of the effluent was 156 5 mg l which met the discharge standard of 180 mg l for the rp iwtp in addition the codmn toc ratio of the effluent was 1 7 which was slightly lower than that suggested by the moe of south korea 1 8 indicating that a moderate amount of non biodegradable organic matter was present in the effluent of the rp wastewater the doc toc ratio in the effluent was 98 which is in line with the mbr process interestingly the suva254 of the rp wastewater effluent was 0 09 l mg m this is relatively low compared to those of other types of wastewater effluents investigated in this study which ranged between 0 62 and 2 44 l mg m therefore the characteristics of rp industrial wastewater are very different from those of wastewater originating from different industrial wastewater sources as displayed in fig s3 a a relatively less abundant peak a and no peak c were detected in the treated effluent in contrast peaks t1 t2 and b which are relatively readily biodegradable were dominant the order of intensity of these peaks was b t1 and t2 and these peaks exhibited a ratio of 98 in the treated effluent this indicated that biological wastewater treatment was not sufficient to reduce organic matter substances the biological wastewater treatment corresponded to a bod removal rate of 62 in the biological basin the biodegradability of industrial wastewater effluent can be determined based on a bod5 codcr ratio of 0 06 12 the bod5 codcr value of the rp iwtp effluent was observed to be 0 07 which indicates that either biodegradable or non degradable organic matter is discharged at a higher rate in the effluent than the rate of relatively readily biodegradable organic matter however since the absolute concentration of the bod5 and codcr was 40 4 mg l and 544 2 mg l respectively it can be seen that insufficient biodegradation was achieved although tracking a certain type of compound was beyond the scope of this study in the context of improving the biological performance of mbr with regards to organic matter the poor decomposition of protein based organic components may be related to the surfactants used in the manufacturing process of the rp iwtp surfactants used in the process might negatively influence the metabolism of microorganisms in the mbr basin however the microbial activity in the bioreactor expressed in terms of atp was 0 12 mg atp g mlvss due to limited literature on the effect of atp on activated sludge activity for industrial wastewater similar to rp iwtp an exact comparison cannot be made nevertheless according to maeng et al 20 who operated a lab scale mbr that treated synthetic wastewater under different solids retention time srts the activity of activated sludge residing in the aerobic basin of rp iwtp was stable based on the atp measured this is in line with a moderate mlvss mlss ratio of 0 76 similar to what has normally been observed in sludge from municipal wastewater 14 another reason for the low biodegradation of organic matter and consequently high intensity of fluorescence peaks t1 t2 and b could be that extremely long srt resulted in a high concentration of extracellular polymeric substance eps in the treated effluent the analytical determination of epss was not carried out in this study however the presence of tyrosine like fluorescence peak b in the treated effluent as well as in the nf permeate seems to be highly correlated with eps 19 as expected based on the previously described nf process on paper wastewater the reduction of each of the fluorescence peaks through the nf process was highly variable the removal rates of peaks t1 t2 b and c were 90 86 87 and 89 respectively fig 5 shows the individual hydrophilic doc concentrations in treated rp industrial wastewater and their concentrations after treatment with the nf process as shown in fig 5 nf led to a 90 doc removal in particular the organic carbon removal efficiencies of 1 20 kda 350 1000 da and lmw acids and neutrals were 98 94 and 85 respectively as expected the high molecular weight organic carbon was almost completely removed through the nf process similarly as observed in the paper and pulp mill wastewater treatment plants the removal of lmw carbon from rp wastewater was 85 which suggests that the lmw carbon was not impacted by the electrostatic repulsion on the surface of the nano membrane in addition most of the lmw carbon present in the treated effluent was characterized by a molecular weight greater than 200 da considering the removal trends from the perspectives of fluorescence intensity and molecular weight two stage membrane processes microfiltration followed by nf could be applied to this type of wastewater interestingly nf membrane is characterized by the capacity of permeating mono valent ions e g sodium chloride and rejection of divalent and multivalent ions e g sodium sulfate such benefits offered by nf membrane facilitate a wide range of nf membrane application into industrial wastewater treatment 1 in this context the present study was confirmed that the organic matter in the paper mill wastewater effluent was sufficiently removable by nf membrane a promising strategy to improve the nonbiodegradable organic matter in the industrial wastewater effluent could be the application of the nf membrane process 4 conclusions this research was conducted in the framework of lowering the toc in the effluent of industrial wastewater matrices the dom characterization tools were useful in terms of tracking the various influent sources of toc affecting the overall performance of the public iwtp i e industrial park wastewater treatment plant and understand the removal of toc regarding the private iwtps the nf process completely eliminated hydrophilic doc as confirmed by lc ocd despite the differences in wastewater characteristics of three selected iwtps bulk dom characterization seems to be a suitable tool for tracking raw wastewater features for public iwtp process detailed organic matter characterization using a combination of suva254 and lc ocd could serve as an alternative tool for tracking the wastewater sources influencing the overall biological performance of public iwtps as well as for suggesting alternative processes the lab scale experiment i e nf was implemented in a batch type reactor thereby calling for large scale experiments to support the potential installation of existing iwtps additionally our approach may serve as a guideline for countries that set toc as the effluent standard in the future further research is needed to explore the organic matter characteristics of other industrial wastewaters such as wastewater from petroleum refining

13160,since 2021 national standards of south korea for industrial wastewater discharge to surface water have changed from chemical oxygen demand to total organic carbon for the organic matter conventional organic matter parameters e g biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon are limited means of understanding the behavior of dissolved organic matter in industrial wastewater treatment processes thus the current study used advanced dissolved organic matter characterization tools e g fluorescence excitation emission matrix and size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection to scrutinize industrial wastewater characteristics from three full scale industrial wastewater treatment plants iwtps the tools were conducive to tracking industrial wastewater sources of total organic carbon influencing the overall performance of iwtps and proposing alternative processes to lower total organic carbon concentration in the effluent the results of this study suggest that the diagnosis of iwtps based on dissolved organic matter characteristics could be a useful tool for providing more insight into total organic carbon management graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chemical oxygen demand discharge standards industrial wastewater total organic carbon 1 introduction industrial activities have diversified and expanded resulting in a large increase of hazardous waste including non biodegradable and toxic compounds in industrial wastewater that are difficult to attenuate organic matter is the most relevant cause of water pollution particularly dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater systems either consumes dissolved oxygen do or deteriorates water quality in aquatic environments therefore wastewater needs to be adequately treated before discharge into water bodies over the years biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod have been widely used and regarded as important environmental indicators of organic matter present in wastewater matrices fig 1 shows a chronological representation of the parameters of organic matter that have been used in south korea for the management of organic matter in rivers and municipal and industrial wastewaters 23 36 cod can be a relatively precise indicator that uses strong chemical oxidants and it can be used to determine the oxidation state of organic substances 18 however some disadvantages of using cod include the presence of disruptive inorganic compounds that evoke measurement errors and thereby low reproducibility 2 and the production of hazardous wastes such as hg ii and cr vi 17 codmn was included in wastewater discharge standards in south korea because of its low empirical oxidation rate of approximately 30 60 codmn cannot determine the compounds that are difficult to degrade as accurately as codcr 21 accordingly there has been an ongoing discussion on the management of refractory organic matter in wastewater treatment as a result total organic carbon toc has received much attention as a substitute for cod 17 codmn which has been used in wastewater effluent standards in south korea since 1981 was replaced with toc in 2020 in the case of public industrial wastewater treatment plants iwtps simultaneously receiving domestic wastewater and various types of industrial wastewater and will be completely phased out by 2022 in the case of private iwtps 36 the fundamental motivation behind the introduction of the new policy arose from the need to minimize the amount of recalcitrant organic compounds in water bodies therefore the ministry of environment in south korea has been aiming to decrease the toc concentration of industrial wastewater effluent entering into receiving water bodies toc is an index that can quantify a wide range of organic matter by measuring the amount of carbon dioxide generated by directly oxidizing organic substances specifically toc is a method that directly measures the amount of carbon thus it can not only accurately quantify the amount of organic substances in the water body but can also possibly reduce any measurement errors that may occur in cod estimation therefore organic matter that was not detected through cod may be reflected in toc thus toc has been regarded as an alternative analytical method for the detection of non degradable organic substances in water samples 34 the specific advantages of toc over cod analytical methods may include i lower time consumption required for analysis 6 ii avoidance of the use of toxic chemical reagents and thereby lower production of residual by products that need to be disposed of after analytical determinations 2 and iii automatic measurement with a small number of samples 34 in addition toc aids the detection of refractory organic matter containing more complex materials that is normally observed in industrial wastewater 11 it is necessary to prepare toc management plans for iwtps that are facing difficulties in meeting the new industrial wastewater effluent guidelines which are national regulatory standards for industrial wastewater discharge into surface water specifically the suggested codmn toc ratios for public iwtps and private iwtps are 1 3 and 1 8 respectively 36 however there are some public and private iwtps where the ratios are lower than the specified ratios this can occur because the determination of codmn in the effluent can lead to a relatively lower amount of organic carbon specifically the organic matter is characterized by refractory compounds resulting in underestimation of codmn the organic matter loading in public iwtps is directly affected by the effluent toc discharged from industrial facilities located within the wastewater treatment area therefore the effluent toc of public iwtps should be managed through appropriate reduction of the influent sources to meet the toc standards thus it is essential to investigate the source of non biodegradable organic matter which affects the overall performance of toc removal in public iwtps the conventional organic matter parameters of bod and cod as well as toc itself may provide limited information on aspects such as the biodegradability of industrial wastewater effluent through bod toc or bod cod ratios further specific information on the components or characteristics of organic matter i e composition and structure hydrophilicity hydrophobicity aromaticity and molecular weight distribution in industrial wastewater may be useful for the enhancement of the performance of treatment plants dom characterization was utilized to overcome the current limitations imposed by conventional global parameters specific ultraviolet absorbance suva which is determined by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 by the dissolved organic carbon doc of a sample can explain the aromaticity of wastewater samples 2 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem explains the dom characteristics by showing several well known fluorescence peaks t1 t2 a b and c 27 liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd can provide apparent molecular weight distribution of doc in wastewater samples 8 compared to conventional organic matter parameters the bulk organic matter characterization parameters are characterized by relatively fast analysis with little preparation and fewer samples in particular the benefits of feem are that it is i highly sensitive non destructive and non invasive ii reagentless and iii inexpensive thus it can provide prompt feedback for the characterization of wastewater samples 9 based on this advanced organic matter characterization tools can be used to track influent sources influencing the public iwtps and to identify alternative processes to reduce toc concentration in iwtp effluents to date an increasing number of researchers have focused on characterizing organic matter in industrial wastewater using advanced organic matter characterization tools however the application of analytical technology in industrial environments remains challenging in the context of the overall toc management of iwtps in this study three iwtps were investigated using advanced organic matter characterization tools and conventional organic matter parameters the objectives of the study were twofold i to investigate the various influent sources i e either refractory or readily biodegradable affecting a public iwtp and ii to suggest potential processes for iwtps through lab scale experiments based on organic matter compositions 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of research three iwtps that have exceeded the toc standards for effluent discharge were selected one industrial park wastewater treatment plant public iwtp and two private iwtps a paper mill and a rubber plastic producer sampling was carried out from july to october 2020 using the grab sampling method the comprehensive approaches used in this study are presented in fig 2 2 2 characteristics of industrial wastewater treatment plant general information regarding the selected iwtps investigated in this study is tabulated in table 1 each treatment plant was characterized by its wastewater source the public iwtp receives both domestic and industrial wastewaters in particular the public iwtp mainly accepts the following influent categories i basic organic compounds boc such as methyl chloride produced by the processing of coal tar and other mineral tar at high temperatures ii basic inorganic compounds bic including inorganic acids metal and non metal oxides excluding metal oxides for inorganic dyes alkalis and iii byproducts of petroleum refining one of the two private iwtps treats wastewater from paper manufacturing only the other iwtp is characterized by a small scale facility that produces rubber and plastic rp currently biological wastewater treatment using an aerobic activated sludge process is being employed in the three iwtps 2 3 analytical methods the industrial wastewater samples collected from both the public and private iwtps were subjected to various chemical analyses bod5 codmn codcr toc and doc measured with the same sample used for toc but through 0 45 μm filtration using standard methods 24 the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2 adenosine triphosphate atp was employed to evaluate the activity of activated sludge according to the method described by bäckman and gytel 3 the temperature and do of each sample were measured using a do probe do 31p japan the ph was measured using a ph probe hm 30p japan the collected samples were immediately cooled in a cool box the transport time for samples from the iwtps to the laboratory where the chemical analyses and lab scale experiments were conducted was approximately 3 5 h once the samples had arrived at the laboratory they were either immediately analyzed or refrigerated prior to the analysis 24 2 4 bulk organic matter characterization all samples used for analyses in bulk organic matter characterization experiments were filtered through a 0 45 μm polypropylene filter whatman usa the quantification of doc in the wastewater investigated in this study was conducted using a toc analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan and uv254 was measured using a spectrophotometer dr5000 hach usa the doc was measured as non purgeable organic carbon doc were determined in triplicate so the average doc concentration was used for the determination of suva254 uv254 measurements deionized water was first placed in a quartz cell with a path length of 1 cm to set a reference i e auto zeroing this was followed by sample measurements based on these two parameters suva254 can be calculated by dividing uv254 by doc indicating the aromaticity of the wastewater samples a spectrofluorometer rf 5301 shimadzu japan with an arc lamp as a light source was used to investigate the fluorescent characteristics of doc in each type of wastewater and consequently to produce three dimensional feem spectra i e contour plots of fluorescence intensities using sigmaplot 12 5 spss inc usa all samples were diluted under 2 mg l of doc to avoid fluorescence quenching 26 feems were measured within the temperature range of 20 25 c 5 the feem were scanned at excitation ex emission em wavelengths of 220 400 nm in 10 nm excitation increments and 280 600 nm in 1 nm emission steps the feem peaks monitored in this study can be classified into two categories protein like peaks b t1 and t2 and humic like peaks a and c specifically the five peak regions observed in our study were as follows protein like peaks t1 tryptophan like ex 220 240 nm em 330 360 nm t2 tryptophan like ex 270 280 nm em 330 360 nm humic like peaks a ex 230 260 nm em 400 450 nm and c ex 300 340 nm em 400 450 nm based on park et al 25 and b tyrosine like ex 220 230 nm em 309 321 nm based on henderson et al 13 to further determine the characteristics of doc in terms of apparent molecular weight distribution size exclusion chromatography was performed using a lc ocd model 8 doc labor germany the lc ocd allows the quantification of doc into five sub fractions biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 20 kda building blocks 350 1000 da low molecular weight lmw acids 350 da and lmw neutrals 350 da 15 it should be noted that the five types of doc fractions mentioned above are classified based on natural organic matter nom therefore all wastewater analyzed in this study was expressed in terms of the molecular weight represented by each type of organic carbon except for the nom based paper mill wastewater 2 5 lab scale of nf membrane experimental set up and procedures the bench scale cross flow filtration unit consisted of an influent tank a high pressure pump and a pressurized chamber where nanofiltration nf was performed the bench scale dead end filtration unit was equipped with two analogue pressure gauges wika germany the cross flow filtration experiment was performed at ambient temperature and 500 kpa using effluent from industrial iwtps that had been pre treated with 1 2 μm filtration to avoid inclusion of large particles the industrially treated effluent stream was introduced into the pressurized chamber through a 10 mm orifice using a high pressure pump hydra cell model number g03eksghfeha wanner engineering inc usa the composite nf permeate obtained over 24 h was collected in a plastic bottle placed on an electronic scale a d model number cb 12 k japan connected to a data acquisition system for continuous monitoring of the flux as a function of time the retentate that did not pass through the membrane was released back into the influent tank the membrane used in this experiment was made of a polyamide fully aromatic polyamide thin film composite ne2521 toray chemical korea inc south korea a flat sheet membrane tailored from the spiral wound membrane element was placed inside the pressurized chamber providing an effective filtration area of 42 5 cm2 the molecular weight cutoff mwco of this membrane was 200 da that is organic carbon having a molecular weight smaller than 200 da could pass through the nanomembrane whereas organic carbon with a molecular weight greater than 200 da was trapped prior to the experiments the membrane was stored in deionized water for at least 24 h to avoid contamination 3 results and discussion for toc management of both public and private iwtps two main approaches were employed based on the effluent toc concentration of each iwtp to investigate the current risk of exceeding the secondary effluent standard of toc various influent sources entering the public iwtp were investigated to determine conventional organic matter parameters i e bod cod and toc as well as dom characterization in the case of individual iwtps a lab scale test was conducted to improve the effluent toc water quality standards a potential alternative process was suggested based on the detailed characteristics of the effluent in this case the problem regarding the effluent toc from each iwtp was first mentioned followed by solutions that could be applied regarding the fractionation of lc ocd when organic matter in wastewater was a substance of natural origin biopolymers humic substances building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals were used however when organic matter was a substance of synthetic or chemical origin the molecular weight range corresponding to each sub fraction of doc was used rather than the conventional term used in lc ocd for nom 3 1 industrial park wastewater treatment plant public iwtp for biological wastewater treatment the public iwtp was operated as de nitrogen and phosphorus denipho process in the bioreactor bod5 was reduced by 92 codmn by 90 and toc by 68 3 the toc concentration of the effluent was 17 6 mg l which met the discharge standard of 25 mg l the bod5 toc of the effluent was 0 03 which indicated significantly low biodegradability 29 in addition the codmn toc which was only used in south korea as a conversion rate from codmn to toc was 0 34 which was lower than the value of 1 3 suggested by the moe of south korea for public iwtps 36 this indicated a large amount of refractory organic matter cannot be determined by cod in the effluent the suva254 of the influent was 0 93 l mg m and it decreased moderately to a value of 0 62 l mg m in the effluent therefore it can be derived that some fractions of aromatic organics were removed similar values have been reported by jin et al 16 who investigated dissolved effluent organic matter from a public iwtp treating mainly domestic wastewater even though the public iwtp met the effluent criteria it indicated low value of codmn toc that is nonbiodegradable organic matter remained in the effluent in this case tracking the causative substance seems to be more appropriate than the implementation of additional processes for the reduction of toc in the effluent to track the influent sources for optimum management of the public iwtp it is essential to characterize the organic substances as illustrated in fig 3 a the public iwtp accepts three main influent sources influent source 1 mainly consists of wastewater from facilities producing boc and bic based on the industry classification list of south korea more than 90 of the wastewater was generated from these two chemical facilities and flowed into the public iwtp influent sources 2 and 3 mainly consist of wastewater discharged from petroleum refining facilities and the chemical industry respectively fig 3 a shows the doc loading rate of each influent source flowing into the public iwtp the doc loads of influent sources 1 2 and 3 were 72 4 kg d 72 7 kg d and 1 3 kg d respectively that is influent sources 1 and 2 accounted for most of the doc load of the public iwtp 99 domestic wastewater generated from a village located within the wastewater treatment area flows into the public iwtp and it accounts for a relatively low proportion 8 on average of the total flow rate generated the loading rates of doc was significantly lower than that of influent 1 2 and 3 therefore it was not considered in the calculation of the doc loading rate as previously described the boc facility a member of influent source 1 considerably affected 95 the doc loading rate of influent source 1 in this study therefore considering the doc load alone it can be observed that the boc facility has a significant influence on the overall doc of the public iwtp however compared to that of public iwtp influents as well as influent sources 2 and 3 the boc facility reported a considerably low suva254 of 0 05 l mg m indicating that the wastewater of the boc facility is relatively non humic 33 in addition the bod5 toc ratio of the boc facility was 1 48 indicating relatively biodegradable organic substances this result is in agreement with the results of a previous study 29 that reported that when the bod5 toc ratio of raw wastewater is 1 2 2 0 it can be regarded as biodegradable organic matter in this regard influent source 1 including the boc facility may not be the main contributor to the increased effluent toc concentration of the public iwtp compared to influent source 1 ultimately boc facility wastewater the suva254 of influent 2 and 3 were 1 13 and 1 49 respectively the bod5 toc of influent 2 and 3 were 1 74 and 0 77 respectively since bod5 toc and toc did not seem to be decisive indicators for determining organic matter characteristics different carbon sources were tracked by lc ocd analysis to investigate the characteristics of dom which helped in understanding the overall performance of the public iwtp fig 3 b shows the fraction of hydrophilic doc compositions and the bod5 toc ratio of each influent source and effluent no precise calculation of mass balance was performed on the loading rates of toc and doc due to the limitations in the availability of data table s2 as shown in fig 3 b five components of each wastewater type were identified by lc ocd the influent and effluent of the public iwtp were mainly composed of neutral organic carbon smaller than 300 da the higher fraction of lmw carbon was attributed to the metabolism of microorganisms that converted large molecular size dom in the influent into relatively lmw organics in the effluent 32 similarly neutral organic carbon 300 da constituted the majority of influent source 1 87 4 in contrast the major constituents of influent sources 2 and 3 were assigned to organic carbon acids 300 da 41 6 and organic carbon 20 kda 57 respectively considering the doc loading rate towards the public iwtp neutral organic carbon 300 da appears to be the key contributor to the doc concentration and therefore accounts for the performance of the public iwtp in the context of decreasing effluent doc and thereby toc concentration the concentration of neutral organic carbon 300 da in the influent and effluent was 30 4 mg l and 15 8 mg l respectively this implies that 52 of neutral organic carbon 300 da was removed during the treatment process most likely through biological treatment in addition the neutral organic carbon 300 da fraction contributed to 84 6 of the doc in the effluent from public iwtp the bod removal rate in the process including primary and secondary treatments was 92 and it was observed that most of the organic matter was biologically removed here a discrepancy was observed in the neutral organic carbon 300 da in the context of biological wastewater treatment specifically the neutral organic carbon 300 da i e lmw neutrals is considered hydrophilic and bioavailable in the context of nom 4 in terms of industrial wastewater the neutral organic carbon 300 da was not different thus the results of this study show that most of the neutral organic carbon 300 da remaining in the effluent would be either biodegradable or slowly biodegradable thereby requiring proper treatment and management as summarized in table s2 the intensity of fluorescence of organic substances of influent source 1 including the boc facility was relatively much lower than that of influent sources 2 and 3 when normalized based on doc concentration that is based on the normalized feem influent sources 2 and 3 showed higher fluorescence intensity than influent source 1 comparing influent sources 1 and 2 with similar doc loading rates the peaks t1 t2 b a and c of influent source 2 were 4 2 4 4 4 2 2 9 and 2 4 times higher than those of influent source 1 respectively table s2 this implies that the influent sources 2 and 3 have a greater influence on the sum of influent entering into the public iwtp and consequently to the overall performance of public iwtp in terms of toc removal than influent source 1 in addition as presented in fig s1 protein like peaks t1 and t2 and tyrosine like peak b were more prevalent than peaks a and c in all influent sources indicating the presence of relatively biodegradable matter this result is in agreement with the results reported by yu et al 35 the suva values of influent sources 2 and 3 were 5 1 and 6 8 times higher than that of influent source 1 respectively indicating the relatively low biodegradability of influent sources 2 and 3 based on our investigations the wastewater discharged from the boc facility is possibly biologically removed and the components of influent sources 2 and 3 characterized by relatively refractory organic matter may remain in the effluent and thereby require additional management of toc finally although the biological treatment of toc was satisfactory to some extent 77 removal rate an improvement in the biological performance of toc removal during the biological treatment process may be required through the alteration of some operating parameters such as solids retention time and mlss concentrations to keep the effluent toc concentration as low as possible 3 2 paper and pulp mill wastewater treatment plant for biological wastewater treatment the paper mill iwtp was operated as unox process utilizing high purity oxygen for aeration the removal efficiencies of bod5 codmn and toc were 94 7 85 2 and 87 6 respectively therefore it can be seen that the bioreactor was being operating stably the toc concentration of the effluent for the paper mill iwtp was 49 5 mg l which did not meet the discharge standard of 40 mg l in addition the codmn toc ratio of the effluent was 1 6 which was lower than the value of 1 8 suggested by the moe of south korea indicating that a moderate amount of non biodegradable organic matter remained in the effluent similarly the bod5 toc value of the effluent from the paper industry was reported to be 0 50 0 75 31 the bod5 toc of the effluent was 0 48 in this study and indicated that some biologically degradable organic matter remained in the effluent which agrees with the fact that the bod5 concentration in the effluent was 23 6 mg l this is relatively high compared to the values reported by eckenfelder 12 the doc toc of the effluent was 88 1 and the suva254 value of the effluent was 2 44 l mg m coagulation aids reduction of the doc when the suva254 was higher than 2 l mg m and the higher the suva254 the higher the humic fractions in the doc 33 because both adsorption and coagulation are favorable for the removal of humics in the doc these can be candidates for the overall reduction of doc and consequently the toc concentration in the effluent however an activated carbon adsorption process was already in operation for the final treatment of wastewater in this iwtp in addition the lc ocd results showed that the organic carbon in the effluent was composed of a hydrophobic fraction 34 7 and a hydrophilic fraction 65 3 specifically the each of hydrophilic doc fraction was as follows biopolymers 12 humic substances 10 7 building blocks 24 9 lmw acids 13 1 and lmw neutrals 39 4 moreover a comparison was made on the results in terms of lc ocd before and after the application of the activated carbon adsorption tank for final discharge the comparison revealed that a minor reduction was observed in building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals with activated carbon adsorption not shown in this paper therefore it was confirmed that lmw organic carbon is hardly removed by the adsorption mechanism which agrees with the results of previous studies 4 to achieve improved toc concentrations a lab scale nf test was conducted land and capital cost restriction in the iwtp informed the selection of nf in addition the nf process would not be used to treat the entire quantity of wastewater for final discharge that is it may be suggested that a part of the effluent is treated with nf and the rest is treated with the existing activated carbon adsorption process so that the two treated effluents are blended and subsequently discharged rather than treating the entire wastewater with the nf process fig 4 shows the individual hydrophilic doc concentrations in treated industrial wastewater and their concentrations after treatment with nf the application of nf molecular weight distribution can provide detailed and useful information on organic matter characteristics as shown in fig 4 the nf performance was successful with a doc removal of 93 when considering the sub fraction of doc the removal efficiencies of biopolymers humic substances building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals were 99 99 96 76 and 93 respectively as expected high molecular weight organic carbon entities such as biopolymers humic substances and building blocks were almost completely removed however contrary to previous observations that lmw neutrals are characterized by low electrostatic repulsion and thereby higher permeability through the nf membrane 22 30 the removal efficiency of lmw neutrals in this study was relatively high 93 since the mwco of the nf membrane was 200 da it seems that the lmw neutrals were occupied with most of the organic carbon with a molecular weight greater than 200 da the nf membrane used in this study was made of polyamide and the surface of the membrane had a positive charge at a low ph and a negative charge at a high ph the ph of the treated industrial wastewater used in this study was 6 85 indicating a very weak acidity i e almost neutral based on the donnan effect 28 considering that the surface charge of lmw acids is negatively charged some lmw acids could pass through the membrane the membrane surface is partially positively charged whereas others were excluded the membrane surface is partially negatively charged as a result the removal rate of lmw acids was lower than that of lmw neutrals lmw neutrals accounted for 50 of the remaining hydrophilic doc in the permeate followed by 38 of lmw acids and 13 of building blocks however each showed a very low value all below 1 mg l additionally the fluorescence characteristics of the paper mill wastewater are displayed in fig s2 fig s2 a and s2 b show the fluorescence properties of the paper mill wastewater before membrane filtration and the permeate after nano membrane filtration respectively the industrially treated effluent fig s2 a was characterized by the presence of three main feem peaks t1 a and c and a less abundant peak t2 in particular peak a was dominant while peak t2 had the lowest intensity in the effluent this result was in agreement with the results of a previous study 27 however rodríguez vidal et al 27 reported that peak c was dominant this could be due to the different features of the pulp used for paper processing and thereby the different wastewater characteristics five feem peaks were detected in the treated effluent these were a b t1 c and t2 in order of intensity in particular four feem peaks a fulvic like c humic like b tyrosine like and t1 tryptophan like were dominant this is in agreement with the findings of a previous study 10 in addition the fact that the largest percentage of fulvic like peak a remained in the effluent is in line with the findings of another recent study 27 although it has been reported that tyrosine like peak b occupies a lower proportion than tryptophan like peak t1 in wastewater 7 the converse was observed in this study with a difference of approximately 10 in addition peaks t1 and b which are protein like peaks can be biologically removed the high intensity of these in the effluent may be related to the relatively high bod concentration of 23 6 mg l that remained in the effluent requiring an improvement in the biological treatment of biodegradable compounds in the aerobic basin in addition the bod removal rate was low 65 in the biological treatment process in the paper mill wastewater with such effluent characteristics a significant reduction in fluorescence intensity 95 was observed for all five peaks through the nf process which is in agreement with the doc removal of 93 in this study therefore the nf membrane process was favorable for the removal of recalcitrant compounds and biodegradable compounds in this wastewater effluent 3 3 rubber and plastic wastewater treatment plant a similar approach was used in the rp iwtp due to footprint limitation in the existing iwtp as well as the treated effluent characteristics based on lc ocd for biological wastewater treatment the rp iwtp was operated as membrane bioreactor mbr process in the mbr the removal efficiencies of bod5 codmn and toc were 79 76 1 and 72 2 respectively since the rp iwtp has operated as mbr equipped with hollow fiber membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 2 μm the nf process was applied to reduce the toc concentration in the effluent the toc concentration of the effluent was 156 5 mg l which met the discharge standard of 180 mg l for the rp iwtp in addition the codmn toc ratio of the effluent was 1 7 which was slightly lower than that suggested by the moe of south korea 1 8 indicating that a moderate amount of non biodegradable organic matter was present in the effluent of the rp wastewater the doc toc ratio in the effluent was 98 which is in line with the mbr process interestingly the suva254 of the rp wastewater effluent was 0 09 l mg m this is relatively low compared to those of other types of wastewater effluents investigated in this study which ranged between 0 62 and 2 44 l mg m therefore the characteristics of rp industrial wastewater are very different from those of wastewater originating from different industrial wastewater sources as displayed in fig s3 a a relatively less abundant peak a and no peak c were detected in the treated effluent in contrast peaks t1 t2 and b which are relatively readily biodegradable were dominant the order of intensity of these peaks was b t1 and t2 and these peaks exhibited a ratio of 98 in the treated effluent this indicated that biological wastewater treatment was not sufficient to reduce organic matter substances the biological wastewater treatment corresponded to a bod removal rate of 62 in the biological basin the biodegradability of industrial wastewater effluent can be determined based on a bod5 codcr ratio of 0 06 12 the bod5 codcr value of the rp iwtp effluent was observed to be 0 07 which indicates that either biodegradable or non degradable organic matter is discharged at a higher rate in the effluent than the rate of relatively readily biodegradable organic matter however since the absolute concentration of the bod5 and codcr was 40 4 mg l and 544 2 mg l respectively it can be seen that insufficient biodegradation was achieved although tracking a certain type of compound was beyond the scope of this study in the context of improving the biological performance of mbr with regards to organic matter the poor decomposition of protein based organic components may be related to the surfactants used in the manufacturing process of the rp iwtp surfactants used in the process might negatively influence the metabolism of microorganisms in the mbr basin however the microbial activity in the bioreactor expressed in terms of atp was 0 12 mg atp g mlvss due to limited literature on the effect of atp on activated sludge activity for industrial wastewater similar to rp iwtp an exact comparison cannot be made nevertheless according to maeng et al 20 who operated a lab scale mbr that treated synthetic wastewater under different solids retention time srts the activity of activated sludge residing in the aerobic basin of rp iwtp was stable based on the atp measured this is in line with a moderate mlvss mlss ratio of 0 76 similar to what has normally been observed in sludge from municipal wastewater 14 another reason for the low biodegradation of organic matter and consequently high intensity of fluorescence peaks t1 t2 and b could be that extremely long srt resulted in a high concentration of extracellular polymeric substance eps in the treated effluent the analytical determination of epss was not carried out in this study however the presence of tyrosine like fluorescence peak b in the treated effluent as well as in the nf permeate seems to be highly correlated with eps 19 as expected based on the previously described nf process on paper wastewater the reduction of each of the fluorescence peaks through the nf process was highly variable the removal rates of peaks t1 t2 b and c were 90 86 87 and 89 respectively fig 5 shows the individual hydrophilic doc concentrations in treated rp industrial wastewater and their concentrations after treatment with the nf process as shown in fig 5 nf led to a 90 doc removal in particular the organic carbon removal efficiencies of 1 20 kda 350 1000 da and lmw acids and neutrals were 98 94 and 85 respectively as expected the high molecular weight organic carbon was almost completely removed through the nf process similarly as observed in the paper and pulp mill wastewater treatment plants the removal of lmw carbon from rp wastewater was 85 which suggests that the lmw carbon was not impacted by the electrostatic repulsion on the surface of the nano membrane in addition most of the lmw carbon present in the treated effluent was characterized by a molecular weight greater than 200 da considering the removal trends from the perspectives of fluorescence intensity and molecular weight two stage membrane processes microfiltration followed by nf could be applied to this type of wastewater interestingly nf membrane is characterized by the capacity of permeating mono valent ions e g sodium chloride and rejection of divalent and multivalent ions e g sodium sulfate such benefits offered by nf membrane facilitate a wide range of nf membrane application into industrial wastewater treatment 1 in this context the present study was confirmed that the organic matter in the paper mill wastewater effluent was sufficiently removable by nf membrane a promising strategy to improve the nonbiodegradable organic matter in the industrial wastewater effluent could be the application of the nf membrane process 4 conclusions this research was conducted in the framework of lowering the toc in the effluent of industrial wastewater matrices the dom characterization tools were useful in

13161,abstract 99tc is a common radioactive element in nuclear waste due to its long half life and high mobility it easily leads to environmental pollution this study firstly reported the use of titanium trichloride ticl3 as reductant and coagulant to remove perrhenate reo4 which is a non radioactive chemical substitute for 99tco4 the results showed that reo4 could be completely removed removal efficiency of re reach 99 6 under the optimal coagulation conditions and achieved rapid separation of pollutants from water when competing ions such as clo4 coexist at a concentration of 1850 times the removal efficiency of re can still reach 93 9 the standing experiment of flocs in aerobic condition exhibited the existence of high affinity between flocs and re oxides guaranteeing the fixation of re based on the experimental results and various characterizations of the flocs it is proposed that the mechanism is the reduction electrostatic interaction coagulation process firstly the added ti iii hydrolyzed to generate the ti iii hydrates and reacted with reo4 and then the titanium hydrates and reo2 aggregated with each other through electrostatic interaction to form flocs which settled down quickly to achieve the removal of re the results indicated ticl3 may be used as a candidate reagent to eliminate 99tc pollution in water efficiently graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ticl3 perrhenate reduction coagulation radioactive pollution 1 introduction with the advancement of nuclear energy nuclear waste disposal has attracted the attention of numerous researchers 1 technetium 99 99tc a common radioactive element in nuclear waste is produced by thermal fission of uranium 235 235u and plutonium 239 239pu and spontaneous fission of 238u in the crust 2 3 99tc has a long half life 2 13 105 and a high fission yield 6 1 4 5 excessive exposure to 99tc can cause diseases such as skin diseases ulcers and cancer 6 in an oxygen containing environment 99tc mainly exists in the form of pertechnetate 99tco4 7 due to the high solubility of 99tco4 and the low adsorption of celestial ore 99tco4 has high environmental mobility resulting in serious 99tc pollution around nuclear waste 8 10 since the isotopes of 99tc have radiation and re vii and tc vii have similar physicochemical properties including the same ion form and radius researchers usually use reo4 as a non radioactive chemical substitute for 99tco4 2 11 there are many ways to remove reo4 99tco4 from aqueous solutions such as extraction 12 13 ion exchange 14 15 molecular recognition 16 biological reduction 8 17 and chemical reduction 18 19 extraction removal of 99tco4 has problems in practice which require large amounts of toxic or volatile organics and secondary separation for ion exchange regeneration of the ion exchange resin requires a high quality desorption solution and there is still the problem of secondary separation in the desorption solution for the complete removal of 99tco4 on the other hand the instability of the materials in long term storage and the lack of receptors binding tightly with 99tco4 limited the application of molecular recognition 20 the disadvantage of biological reduction is the long duration of action and the lack of stability hence chemical reduction by the advantages of fast action complete reducing 99tco4 to slightly soluble 99tco2 nh2o and separating it from the aqueous solution by physical methods such as filtration or adsorption is considered as one of the most promising technologies 21 22 for example liu et al used starch stabilized nano zero valent iron to reduce reo4 in water and found that about 96 of reo4 in water can be removed in 8 h and the reduction product was reo2 23 metallic zinc has been proven to reduce reo4 in the presence of formic acid efficiently 12 in addition the use of ni doped fe oh 2 s for heterogeneous reduction of 99tco4 has been reported also 24 however the reduction efficiency of this method was not favorable gamma radiation was found to reduce reo4 under alkaline conditions though the operating conditions of this method were harsh 25 in addition photocatalytic reduction and electrochemical reduction are also used to reduce reo4 26 28 with the development of the titanium industry titanium salt has been extensively studied in recent years as a coagulant 29 30 compared with traditional coagulants the most prominent advantage of ti salts as a coagulant is low toxicity 31 in addition it has been found that ticl4 coagulated sludge can produce tio2 with good photocatalytic properties after incineration 32 some contaminants including humic acid 33 dissolved organic matter 34 and algae in water 35 could be removed efficiently with titanium salt coagulation in addition the use of ti salt as a coagulant to treat heavy metals has also been reported sun et al used ti so4 2 as a coagulant to remove as iii and found that compared with fe2 so4 3 the removal efficiency can be increased by nearly 50 36 kuzin et al used ticl3 to reduce and coagulate simultaneously to remove cr vi in water with a maximum removal efficiency of 99 5 37 compared with other common reducing agents ticl3 has the advantage of coagulation effect after being oxidized which can achieve rapid solid liquid separation without adding other reagents or combining with other processes although the research has been reported about using ticl3 as a coagulant to remove heavy metals the research about using this method to remove 99tco4 reo4 have not been reported the overall goal of this study is to verify the feasibility of ticl3 as a reducing agent and coagulant to remove reo4 the specific objectives are as follows 1 investigate the removal performance of ticl3 coagulants towards reo4 under different conditions including ph the molar ratio of ti to re and coagulation mixing time 2 explore the mechanism of coagulation remove of reo4 with ticl3 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials and reagents ammonium perrhenate nh4reo4 titanium trichloride ticl3 and sodium hydroxide naoh were all purchased from shanghai macleans biochemical co ltd china these reagents were used directly in the experiment without further purification all solutions in the experiment are prepared with ultrapure water 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 reduction coagulation experiment the whole process of the reduction coagulation experiment was carried out on the programmable jar tester zhongrun zr4 6 china with cylindrical jars containing 200 ml samples of suspension 0 1 m solution of naoh was employed to adjust the ph of the solution for guaranteeing the ph of the solution at specified value monitored with ph meter hach usa after adding ticl3 solution in the coagulation process the reaction solution was stirred at 250 rpm for 1 min and at 40 rpm for 5 min after the stirring stops the solution settled for five minutes and the supernatant at a distance of 2 cm from the liquid surface was siphoned as a sample the flocs centrifuged were dried in vacuum oven and kept in vacuum until analysis the supernatant sample was divided into two parts one part was used to measure the concentration of re after passing through a polyethersulfone membrane with a pore size of 0 22 μm and another part was used to measure the turbidity without filtration inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry icp oes 700 series agilent technologies was employed to determine the concentration of re and the removal efficiency of re is calculated with the following formula removal efficiency of re c c 0 c 0 100 where c0 is the concentration of re in the solution before the reaction and c is the concentration of re after the reaction the turbidity of the solution was measured by a portable turbidity meter 2100q hach co us 2 2 2 mechanism exploration experiments the difference from the previous experiments is that the experiment was carried out in a 250 ml gas scrubber treated anaerobic water was applied to prepare various reagents after nh4reo4 solution was instilled to the scrubber filled with treated anaerobic water to 200 ml and 0 1 m naoh solution was used to adjust the ph of the solution so that the ph of the solution is 6 2 after adding ticl3 solution during the experiments n2 was bubbled to provide an anaerobic atmosphere the aeration was stopped after 6 min then the flocs were centrifuged dried and performed related characterization immediately the whole process of subsequent floc treatment was carried out in a vacuum environment in the control group air was bubbled throughout the experiment and centrifugal drying was carried out in an atmospheric environment 2 3 characterization the crystal structure and specific morphology of the flocs were investigated by x ray diffractometer xrd xrd 7000 shimadzu japan and transmission electron microscope tem 2100f jeol japan respectively infrared fourier transform spectrometer ftir spectrometer nicolet is50 thermo fisher uk were used to obtaining the fourier infrared transform spectrum of flocs and pure ti iv oxides x ray photoelectron spectra xps were obtained by characterizing the flocs with x ray electron spectrometer escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa while the survey and multiregional spectra of c 1 s o 1 s ti 2p and re 4f photoelectron peaks were recorded zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical uk were used to measure zeta potential 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation performance of ticl3 towards perrhenate ticl3 ticl4 and feso4 were used as coagulants to remove reo4 in the aqueous solution fig 1a showed the perrhenate removal efficiency of the three coagulants it can be seen that reo4 was hardly removed using feso4 as coagulants which may be due to the higher redox potential of 0 77 v for e 0 fe2 fe3 than re vii iv e 0 0 51 v leading to the absence of electron transfer between fe2 and reo4 38 39 the addition of ticl4 into the aqueous solution could generate ti iv hydrate which has a high affinity with heavy metal 40 41 however since the highest valence state of ti is 4 ticl4 can hardly remove reo4 by reducing reo4 to reo2 therefore only about 16 9 of the reo4 could be removed by the affinity between ticl4 with reo4 when using ticl4 as coagulants in addition a stable colloid system appeared in the reaction solution rather than flocs in the ticl3 coagulation process large black flocs were observed immediately after adding ticl3 fig 1b and the flocs settled on the bottom in 5 min in static conditions fig 1c meanwhile the removal efficiency of re was near to 100 in comparison with ticl4 the hydrolysates of ticl3 have a high reduction capacity so which could react quickly with reo4 the in situ formed reo2 may adhere to the surface of titanium hydrolysates and change their surface potentials leading to the aggregation of particles and formation of flocs 3 2 the effect of operating conditions the optimum of the operating conditions is important for the reduction coagulation experiments therefore the relations of removal efficiency with ph molar ration of ti to re and coagulation time were researched intensively in the experiments 3 2 1 the effect of molar ratio fig 2 showed the change of re removal efficiency and turbidity of solution with molar ratio when the initial re dosed at 54 μmol l and the ph was 6 2 as the molar ratio of ti to re decreased from 30 1 to 5 1 the removal efficiency of re appeared a downward trend from the highest removal efficiency of 99 6 to the lowest removal efficiency of 21 3 furthermore the turbidity of the supernate reached a minimum of 1 ntu when the molar ratio of ti to re was 25 1 which was consistent with the results using ticl3 coagulant to treat other pollutants 42 when the molar ratio was high the excessive particles formed by the hydrolysis of excessive ti iii leading to higher turbidity in the solution nevertheless when the molar ratio was low since the optimal coagulant dosage was not reached it was difficult to format large flocs in the water increasing turbidity 3 2 2 the effect of ph as exhibited in fig 3 the removal efficiency of re reached close to 100 when ph was in the range of 3 2 6 2 it is worth noting that when the ph was 2 2 the removal efficiency of re was closed to zero this was because ti iii was very stable when the ph was less than 3 43 and it was hard to hydrolyzed to adsorb reo4 and reduced it to achieve the purpose of removing re when the ph increased to more than 4 the removal efficiency of re rapidly increased to more than 97 and at the same time flocs began to appear in the beaker this was not difficult to explain ti iii became unstable and reduced reo4 to produce water insoluble re containing oxides as the ph rose with ti iv as a coagulant the flocculate entered the optimal ph range 31 hence the phenomenon of this experiment appeared following the ph rose above 7 2 the removal efficiency of re began to decrease this was because in the case of high ph the hydrolysates of ti carried a higher negative charge and it was hard to adsorb reo4 and reduced it 44 what is noteworthy was that when the ph surpassed 7 2 no flocs were observed in the solution this may be attributable to the sharp decrease in the size of hydrolysates of ti during oxidation at higher ph consequently the hydrolysates were not easy to aggregate to form flocs that were easy to observe 44 while the ph was 2 2 there was no reduction reaction takes at this moment the reaction system did not produce insoluble re containing oxides with the increase of ph the content of these re containing oxides rose sharply resulting in turbidity increased sharply increasing ph between 4 2 and 7 2 the reaction system produced flocs leading to a sharp turbidity drop further increasing ph to greater than 7 2 the reaction system did not produce flocs although reo oh 3 will be produced and dissolve in water under high ph conditions the ti hydrolysates were increasing so that the turbidity has been maintained at a high level without change 26 3 2 3 the effect of sediment time fig 4 a and b exhibited the effect of different ph and different molar ratios of ti to re on the removal efficiency of re over time it could be seen from the figure that the reaction has reached about 80 of the maximum removal efficiency of re under the respective operating conditions in the first few seconds of the reaction which demonstrated that most of the reduction reaction had been completed almost instantaneously when the coagulation time increased to 2 min the re removal efficiency under various reaction conditions was close to or reached the maximum removal efficiency the reducing ability of different reductants to reduce 99tco4 reo4 compared with ticl3 as listed in table s1 although ticl3 has fewer advantages in reducing power than other reductants it was significantly faster in reducing reaction speed it is improper to compare the reaction speed directly but other reducing agents could not achieve such a high reduction capacity with such a fast reaction rate 3 3 the effects of coexisting substances the effects of common anions no3 so4 2 and clo4 and their concentrations on re removal in nuclear wastewater were evaluated to explore the potential of ticl3 in practical environmental applications as shown in fig 5a 45 46 it could be seen from fig 5a that while the dosage of no3 was 10 mmol l the removal efficiency of re dropped fleetly to 34 5 which indicated that no3 had highly adverse effects on the adsorption and reduction of reo4 by hydrolysates of ti iii this is because the redox potential of no3 is 0 96 v which is higher than the redox potential of reo4 45 thence ticl3 will preferentially reduce no3 thus reducing the removal efficiency of re 47 for so4 2 at a concentration of 10 mmol l the removal efficiency of re was lessened to 85 which shown that so4 2 affected the removal efficiency of re but the impact was very restricted even at a concentration of 100 mmol l removal efficiency could still reach 79 the influence of so4 2 can be explained by energetics in ion exchange so4 2 can occupy part of the adsorption sites of hydrolysates of ti iii resulting in a part of reo4 that cannot be adsorbed and thus be reduced to remove 48 in the case of containing clo4 even if the concentration of clo4 achieved 100 mmol l the removal efficiency of re could still reach 94 this may be put down to the fact that clo4 was relatively stable at ph 6 2 and had very low oxidation 49 since reo4 could be reduced by hydrolysates of ti iii which precisely promoted the selective adsorption of hydrolysates of ti iii to reo4 45 besides the effects of common metal ions cs ba2 mg2 ca2 and ni2 in nuclear wastewater on the removal of reo4 by ticl3 were also investigated 46 50 as shown in fig 5b when the dosage of metal ions was up to nearly 20 times higher than reo4 dosage at 1 mmol l the coexistence of cs ba2 ca2 and mg2 had little effect on the removal efficiency of re and the removal efficiency of re could still reach more than 96 compared to the above metal ions ni2 had the greatest influence and the removal efficiency of re decreased to 90 the results may be due to the low redox potential of ni e0 of ni2 ni 0 25 ev leading to the occurrence of the redox reaction between ni2 and ti iii hydrolysate which affects the removal efficiency of re similarly the effects of the organic matters such as edta and humic acid on the removal of reo4 was also evaluated it could be seen that ticl3 was barely able to reduce reo4 in the presence of edta 1 mm and the removal efficiency of re was only 5 this is because edta has a strong complexing ability with metal ions to generate metal complexes when ticl3 was added ti edta complexes were quickly formed making ti3 unable to hydrolyze and hardly reacting with reo4 however humic acid had almost no effect on the removal efficiency of re about 96 of re removed at the concentration of 10 mg l of humic acid in addition anions such as co3 2 which have great influence on reduction coagulation reaction are also studied as shown in fig 5c it could be seen from the figure that hco3 had no effect on the removal efficiency of re while co3 2 and hpo4 2 had some influence but the removal efficiency of re could still reach 94 po4 3 has the greatest impact and when the concentration was 1 mmol l the removal efficiency dropped to 76 the influence trend was po4 3 co3 2 hpo4 2 hco3 based on the experiments the trend could also be understood by the influence of so4 2 compared with reo4 po4 3 hpo4 2 and co3 2 have higher charge densities which means that these ions will occupy the adsorption sites of ti3 hydrolysates thus affecting the adsorption reduction of reo4 and reducing the removal efficiency of re 48 it is worth noting that although the removal efficiency of re remains at a high level in the presence of hpo4 2 and po4 3 the coagulation effect is greatly affected by smaller flocs increased precipitation time and increased turbidity of supernatant and which is also consistent with the research of liu et al 51 3 4 reduction coagulation mechanism 3 4 1 characterization of flocs the element components and crystal structure of the floc sample generated in the coagulation process were determined with transmission electron microscopy tem analysis firstly the pure ti iv oxides and flocs morphology were exhibited in fig 6 in general the elements with larger molecular weight had higher electron density leading to fewer electron penetration and formation of the dark region in the tem image 52 it can be seen that from fig 6b that the region of flocs was darker in comparison with the pure ti iv oxides fig 6a and some ultrafine particles attached to the surface of solid the results revealed the existence of re in the flocs due to the larger molecular weight of re than ti referring to that reo4 was reduced and the generated oxides adhered on the surface of ti iv oxides on the other hands no lattice fringes appeared in the high resolution tem hrtem image of pure ti iv oxides fig 6c demonstrating the amorphous structure of the solid however the lattice spacing in the hrtem image of flocs was 1 95 å fig 6d attributed to the 5 4 1 plane of re2o7 as reported in other literature reo2 could be oxidized in the aqueous solution by dissolved oxygen 26 38 the existence of re2o7 in the flocs may be from the oxidation of reo2 which was the production from the reduction of perrhenate by hydrolysates of ti iii for identifying the re distribution on the flocs element mappings of the flocs were measured and displayed in fig 7 respectively as can be seen from these images a small amount of re atoms distributed on the flocs randomly fig 7c demonstrating the steady anchor of re on the ti iv hydrates fig 7e shows the fr ir spectra of flocs and pure ti iv oxides in these spectra the peak near 510 cm 1 is assigned to the ti o ti in tio2 53 the peak at 1620 cm 1 belongs to the bending vibration of oh and betake the presence of ti oh 54 the peak at 3220 cm 1 can be attributed to the tensile vibration of the oh bond in the adsorption water on the tio2 surface or the crystal water 54 compared with pure titanium oxide there is an extra peak in the flocs located around 910 cm 1 due to the existence of the re o further demonstrating the presence of rhenium oxide in the flocs 55 fig s2 showed the xrd pattern of flocs and pure ti iv oxides it can be seen from the figure that whether flocs or pure titanium oxide were amorphous which was verified from tem images on the other hands the content of re was much smaller relative to ti thus making the xrd patterns present such results 3 4 2 reduction reaction in order to further explore the reaction mechanism the element valent of flocs obtained at ambient or anaerobic conditions were determined by means of xps analysis fig 8 compared the xps spectrum of the two samples the xps spectrum fitting of the re 4f region showed two sets of spin orbit splitting double compounds the peaks with binding energies near 43 1 ev and 45 5 ev corresponded to re iv 4f7 2 and re iv 4f5 2 in the form of reo2 56 57 the peaks at 46 2 ev and 48 6 ev were attributed to the re vii 4f7 2 and re vii 4f5 2 respectively indicating the existence of re vii in the solids 57 58 based on the xps spectra of the two solids it can be inferred that o2 is vital for the oxidation state of the reduction product with n2 protection the content of reo2 in flocs was far higher than at ambient conditions the results revealed that reo2 could be oxidized by o2 again therefore the in situ generated reo2 was oxidized to re2o7 by o2 dissolved in the water in the ambient condition previous studies reported that re2o7 could react with water furtherly to form reo4 re releasing into the solution 59 therefore long term standing experiments were carried out in the following to assess the oxidation and dissolution of reo2 adhered on the flocs at aerobic conditions fig 9 with the increased time of the solids standing in the solution the removal efficiency of re decreased slowly at low ph about 78 4 of the re removal efficiency was retained at ph 4 2 after 2 h late however the concentration of re in the aqueous solution was increased rapidly and reached equilibrium in about 2 h at high ph only 17 6 of re still adhered to the surface of flocs and the color of the flocs changed to yellow grey fig s1 for higher ph conditions both the formation of water soluble substances reo oh 3 and dissolution of re2o7 resulted in a significant decrease in the removal efficiency of re compared to another ph 59 above of all the reaction route during the reduction coagulation process can be represented by the following equations 1 ti 3 3 h 2 o ti oh 3 3 h 2 h reo 4 3 ti oh 3 h 2 o reo 2 3 ti oh 4 3 4 reo 2 3 o 2 2 re 2 o 7 4 re 2 o 7 h 2 o 2 hreo 4 3 4 3 coagulation mechanism zeta potentials of the flocs surface in the reduction coagulation experiments under different ph as shown in fig 10 zeta potentials of the surface of the flocs changed from positive to negative and gradually decreased with ph increased the initial zeta potential was 30 6 mv without added naoh solution however as ph increased to 4 2 6 2 zeta potentials dropped rapidly and became negative and the appearance of flocs could be observed in the solution at this time with ph increased to an alkaline environment zeta potentials once again underwent a rapid decrease process and then remained relatively stable hussain et al reported that the isoelectric point of ti iii flocs was ph 3 0 which was a little lower than the isoelectric point ph 3 8 in this experiment 42 this may be caused by the combination of flocs with in situ formed reo2 as the ph increased from 2 2 to 6 2 the zeta potential decreased from 30 6 mv to 9 8 mv and the coagulation effect was also significantly improved the results indicated that charge neutralization might be the critical mechanism of the coagulation process in this reduction coagulation experiment based on the experimental results of reduction and coagulation and various characterizations of the reaction products the mechanism of removing nh4reo4 by ticl3 is as follows fig 11 the first step is the adsorption reduction process ti iii began to react with h2o and then ti iii hydrolysates adsorb reo4 followed by an in situ oxidation reduction reaction reducing reo4 to reo2 in the coagulation process electrostatic interaction was the dominant force in coalescence of ti iv hydrolysates and reo2 after the reduction reaction and then the in situ generated composites aggregated with each other through nucleation and larger flocs formed which precipitated to remove reo2 at the aerobic condition the in situ formed reo2 may be oxidized and dissolution again generally compared with re the oxide properties of tc are more stable and the more oxidizing ions such as no3 have less interference with tc vii 2 60 therefore better results may be achieved when using ticl3 as a coagulant to treat wastewater containing tc vii consequently ticl3 may be a potential reagent to treat nuclear contaminated wastewater containing 99tc vii 4 summary in this study ticl3 was used as the experimental reagent to remove reo4 in the water during the experiment ticl3 serves as both a reducing agent and coagulant the experimental results show that under the condition of ph 6 2 0 2 and ti re 25 1 the removal efficiency of re can reach 99 9 after 6 min of coagulation and the separation of pollutants and water can be achieved quickly experiments have proved that under low ph conditions the increase in ph is conducive to the removal of reo4 and under high ph conditions it is on the contrary the coexisting ions so4 2 and clo4 will not have much influence on the removal of reo4 subsequent characterization proved that the hydrates of ticl3 could reduce reo4 to insoluble reo2 to achieve the removal of reo4 this study explicates that the ticl3 reduction coagulation method can effectively remove reo4 and is expected to be used as a treatment agent for 99tc containing wastewater which is of exceptional significance for treating nuclear wastewater declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and

materials and reagents ammonium perrhenate nh4reo4 titanium trichloride ticl3 and sodium hydroxide naoh were all purchased from shanghai macleans biochemical co ltd china these reagents were used directly in the experiment without further purification all solutions in the experiment are prepared with ultrapure water 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 reduction coagulation experiment the whole process of the reduction coagulation experiment was carried out on the programmable jar tester zhongrun zr4 6 china with cylindrical jars containing 200 ml samples of suspension 0 1 m solution of naoh was employed to adjust the ph of the solution for guaranteeing the ph of the solution at specified value monitored with ph meter hach usa after adding ticl3 solution in the coagulation process the reaction solution was stirred at 250 rpm for 1 min and at 40 rpm for 5 min after the stirring stops the solution settled for five minutes and the supernatant at a distance of 2 cm from the liquid surface was siphoned as a sample the flocs centrifuged were dried in vacuum oven and kept in vacuum until analysis the supernatant sample was divided into two parts one part was used to measure the concentration of re after passing through a polyethersulfone membrane with a pore size of 0 22 μm and another part was used to measure the turbidity without filtration inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry icp oes 700 series agilent technologies was employed to determine the concentration of re and the removal efficiency of re is calculated with the following formula removal efficiency of re c c 0 c 0 100 where c0 is the concentration of re in the solution before the reaction and c is the concentration of re after the reaction the turbidity of the solution was measured by a portable turbidity meter 2100q hach co us 2 2 2 mechanism exploration experiments the difference from the previous experiments is that the experiment was carried out in a 250 ml gas scrubber treated anaerobic water was applied to prepare various reagents after nh4reo4 solution was instilled to the scrubber filled with treated anaerobic water to 200 ml and 0 1 m naoh solution was used to adjust the ph of the solution so that the ph of the solution is 6 2 after adding ticl3 solution during the experiments n2 was bubbled to provide an anaerobic atmosphere the aeration was stopped after 6 min then the flocs were centrifuged dried and performed related characterization immediately the whole process of subsequent floc treatment was carried out in a vacuum environment in the control group air was bubbled throughout the experiment and centrifugal drying was carried out in an atmospheric environment 2 3 characterization the crystal structure and specific morphology of the flocs were investigated by x ray diffractometer xrd xrd 7000 shimadzu japan and transmission electron microscope tem 2100f jeol japan respectively infrared fourier transform spectrometer ftir spectrometer nicolet is50 thermo fisher uk were used to obtaining the fourier infrared transform spectrum of flocs and pure ti iv oxides x ray photoelectron spectra xps were obtained by characterizing the flocs with x ray electron spectrometer escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa while the survey and multiregional spectra of c 1 s o 1 s ti 2p and re 4f photoelectron peaks were recorded zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical uk were used to measure zeta potential 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation performance of ticl3 towards perrhenate ticl3 ticl4 and feso4 were used as coagulants to remove reo4 in the aqueous solution fig 1a showed the perrhenate removal efficiency of the three coagulants it can be seen that reo4 was hardly removed using feso4 as coagulants which may be due to the higher redox potential of 0 77 v for e 0 fe2 fe3 than re vii iv e 0 0 51 v leading to the absence of electron transfer between fe2 and reo4 38 39 the addition of ticl4 into the aqueous solution could generate ti iv hydrate which has a high affinity with heavy metal 40 41 however since the highest valence state of ti is 4 ticl4 can hardly remove reo4 by reducing reo4 to reo2 therefore only about 16 9 of the reo4 could be removed by the affinity between ticl4 with reo4 when using ticl4 as coagulants in addition a stable colloid system appeared in the reaction solution rather than flocs in the ticl3 coagulation process large black flocs were observed immediately after adding ticl3 fig 1b and the flocs settled on the bottom in 5 min in static conditions fig 1c meanwhile the removal efficiency of re was near to 100 in comparison with ticl4 the hydrolysates of ticl3 have a high reduction capacity so which could react quickly with reo4 the in situ formed reo2 may adhere to the surface of titanium hydrolysates and change their surface potentials leading to the aggregation of particles and formation of flocs 3 2 the effect of operating conditions the optimum of the operating conditions is important for the reduction coagulation experiments therefore the relations of removal efficiency with ph molar ration of ti to re and coagulation time were researched intensively in the experiments 3 2 1 the effect of molar ratio fig 2 showed the change of re removal efficiency and turbidity of solution with molar ratio when the initial re dosed at 54 μmol l and the ph was 6 2 as the molar ratio of ti to re decreased from 30 1 to 5 1 the removal efficiency of re appeared a downward trend from the highest removal efficiency of 99 6 to the lowest removal efficiency of 21 3 furthermore the turbidity of the supernate reached a minimum of 1 ntu when the molar ratio of ti to re was 25 1 which was consistent with the results using ticl3 coagulant to treat other pollutants 42 when the molar ratio was high the excessive particles formed by the hydrolysis of excessive ti iii leading to higher turbidity in the solution nevertheless when the molar ratio was low since the optimal coagulant dosage was not reached it was difficult to format large flocs in the water increasing turbidity 3 2 2 the effect of ph as exhibited in fig 3 the removal efficiency of re reached close to 100 when ph was in the range of 3 2 6 2 it is worth noting that when the ph was 2 2 the removal efficiency of re was closed to zero this was because ti iii was very stable when the ph was less than 3 43 and it was hard to hydrolyzed to adsorb reo4 and reduced it to achieve the purpose of removing re when the ph increased to more than 4 the removal efficiency of re rapidly increased to more than 97 and at the same time flocs began to appear in the beaker this was not difficult to explain ti iii became unstable and reduced reo4 to produce water insoluble re containing oxides as the ph rose with ti iv as a coagulant the flocculate entered the optimal ph range 31 hence the phenomenon of this experiment appeared following the ph rose above 7 2 the removal efficiency of re began to decrease this was because in the case of high ph the hydrolysates of ti carried a higher negative charge and it was hard to adsorb reo4 and reduced it 44 what is noteworthy was that when the ph surpassed 7 2 no flocs were observed in the solution this may be attributable to the sharp decrease in the size of hydrolysates of ti during oxidation at higher ph consequently the hydrolysates were not easy to aggregate to form flocs that were easy to observe 44 while the ph was 2 2 there was no reduction reaction takes at this moment the reaction system did not produce insoluble re containing oxides with the increase of ph the content of these re containing oxides rose sharply resulting in turbidity increased sharply increasing ph between 4 2 and 7 2 the reaction system produced flocs leading to a sharp turbidity drop further increasing ph to greater than 7 2 the reaction system did not produce flocs although reo oh 3 will be produced and dissolve in water under high ph conditions the ti hydrolysates were increasing so that the turbidity has been maintained at a high level without change 26 3 2 3 the effect of sediment time fig 4 a and b exhibited the effect of different ph and different molar ratios of ti to re on the removal efficiency of re over time it could be seen from the figure that the reaction has reached about 80 of the maximum removal efficiency of re under the respective operating conditions in the first few seconds of the reaction which demonstrated that most of the reduction reaction had been completed almost instantaneously when the coagulation time increased to 2 min the re removal efficiency under various reaction conditions was close to or reached the maximum removal efficiency the reducing ability of different reductants to reduce 99tco4 reo4 compared with ticl3 as listed in table s1 although ticl3 has fewer advantages in reducing power than other reductants it was significantly faster in reducing reaction speed it is improper to compare the reaction speed directly but other reducing agents could not achieve such a high reduction capacity with such a fast reaction rate 3 3 the effects of coexisting substances the effects of common anions no3 so4 2 and clo4 and their concentrations on re removal in nuclear wastewater were evaluated to explore the potential of ticl3 in practical environmental applications as shown in fig 5a 45 46 it could be seen from fig 5a that while the dosage of no3 was 10 mmol l the removal efficiency of re dropped fleetly to 34 5 which indicated that no3 had highly adverse effects on the adsorption and reduction of reo4 by hydrolysates of ti iii this is because the redox potential of no3 is 0 96 v which is higher than the redox potential of reo4 45 thence ticl3 will preferentially reduce no3 thus reducing the removal efficiency of re 47 for so4 2 at a concentration of 10 mmol l the removal efficiency of re was lessened to 85 which shown that so4 2 affected the removal efficiency of re but the impact was very restricted even at a concentration of 100 mmol l removal efficiency could still reach 79 the influence of so4 2 can be explained by energetics in ion exchange so4 2 can occupy part of the adsorption sites of hydrolysates of ti iii resulting in a part of reo4 that cannot be adsorbed and thus be reduced to remove 48 in the case of containing clo4 even if the concentration of clo4 achieved 100 mmol l the removal efficiency of re could still reach 94 this may be put down to the fact that clo4 was relatively stable at ph 6 2 and had very low oxidation 49 since reo4 could be reduced by hydrolysates of ti iii which precisely promoted the selective adsorption of hydrolysates of ti iii to reo4 45 besides the effects of common metal ions cs ba2 mg2 ca2 and ni2 in nuclear wastewater on the removal of reo4 by ticl3 were also investigated 46 50 as shown in fig 5b when the dosage of metal ions was up to nearly 20 times higher than reo4 dosage at 1 mmol l the coexistence of cs ba2 ca2 and mg2 had little effect on the removal efficiency of re and the removal efficiency of re could still reach more than 96 compared to the above metal ions ni2 had the greatest influence and the removal efficiency of re decreased to 90 the results may be due to the low redox potential of ni e0 of ni2 ni 0 25 ev leading to the occurrence of the redox reaction between ni2 and ti iii hydrolysate which affects the removal efficiency of re similarly the effects of the organic matters such as edta and humic acid on the removal of reo4 was also evaluated it could be seen that ticl3 was barely able to reduce reo4 in the presence of edta 1 mm and the removal efficiency of re was only 5 this is because edta has a strong complexing ability with metal ions to generate metal complexes when ticl3 was added ti edta complexes were quickly formed making ti3 unable to hydrolyze and hardly reacting with reo4 however humic acid had almost no effect on the removal efficiency of re about 96 of re removed at the concentration of 10 mg l of humic acid in addition anions such as co3 2 which have great influence on reduction coagulation reaction are also studied as shown in fig 5c it could be seen from the figure that hco3 had no effect on the removal efficiency of re while co3 2 and hpo4 2 had some influence but the removal efficiency of re could still reach 94 po4 3 has the greatest impact and when the concentration was 1 mmol l the removal efficiency dropped to 76 the influence trend was po4 3 co3 2 hpo4 2 hco3 based on the experiments the trend could also be understood by the influence of so4 2 compared with reo4 po4 3 hpo4 2 and co3 2 have higher charge densities which means that these ions will occupy the adsorption sites of ti3 hydrolysates thus affecting the adsorption reduction of reo4 and reducing the removal efficiency of re 48 it is worth noting that although the removal efficiency of re remains at a high level in the presence of hpo4 2 and po4 3 the coagulation effect is greatly affected by smaller flocs increased precipitation time and increased turbidity of supernatant and which is also consistent with the research of liu et al 51 3 4 reduction coagulation mechanism 3 4 1 characterization of flocs the element components and crystal structure of the floc sample generated in the coagulation process were determined with transmission electron microscopy tem analysis firstly the pure ti iv oxides and flocs morphology were exhibited in fig 6 in general the elements with larger molecular weight had higher electron density leading to fewer electron penetration and formation of the dark region in the tem image 52 it can be seen that from fig 6b that the region of flocs was darker in comparison with the pure ti iv oxides fig 6a and some ultrafine particles attached to the surface of solid the results revealed the existence of re in the flocs due to the larger molecular weight of re than ti referring to that reo4 was reduced and the generated oxides adhered on the surface of ti iv oxides on the other hands no lattice fringes appeared in the high resolution tem hrtem image of pure ti iv oxides fig 6c demonstrating the amorphous structure of the solid however the lattice spacing in the hrtem image of flocs was 1 95 å fig 6d attributed to the 5 4 1 plane of re2o7 as reported in other literature reo2 could be oxidized in the aqueous solution by dissolved oxygen 26 38 the existence of re2o7 in the flocs may be from the oxidation of reo2 which was the production from the reduction of perrhenate by hydrolysates of ti iii for identifying the re distribution on the flocs element mappings of the flocs were measured and displayed in fig 7 respectively as can be seen from these images a small amount of re atoms distributed on the flocs randomly fig 7c demonstrating the steady anchor of re on the ti iv hydrates fig 7e shows the fr ir spectra of flocs and pure ti iv oxides in these spectra the peak near 510 cm 1 is assigned to the ti o ti in tio2 53 the peak at 1620 cm 1 belongs to the bending vibration of oh and betake the presence of ti oh 54 the peak at 3220 cm 1 can be attributed to the tensile vibration of the oh bond in the adsorption water on the tio2 surface or the crystal water 54 compared with pure titanium oxide there is an extra peak in the flocs located around 910 cm 1 due to the existence of the re o further demonstrating the presence of rhenium oxide in the flocs 55 fig s2 showed the xrd pattern of flocs and pure ti iv oxides it can be seen from the figure that whether flocs or pure titanium oxide were amorphous which was verified from tem images on the other hands the content of re was much smaller relative to ti thus making the xrd patterns present such results 3 4 2 reduction reaction in order to further explore the reaction mechanism the element valent of flocs obtained at ambient or anaerobic conditions were determined by means of xps analysis fig 8 compared the xps spectrum of the two samples the xps spectrum fitting of the re 4f region showed two sets of spin orbit splitting double compounds the peaks with binding energies near 43 1 ev and 45 5 ev corresponded to re iv 4f7 2 and re iv 4f5 2 in the form of reo2 56 57 the peaks at 46 2 ev and 48 6 ev were attributed to the re vii 4f7 2 and re vii 4f5 2 respectively indicating the existence of re vii in the solids 57 58 based on the xps spectra of the two solids it can be inferred that o2 is vital for the oxidation state of the reduction product with n2 protection the content of reo2 in flocs was far higher than at ambient conditions the results revealed that reo2 could be oxidized by o2 again therefore the in situ generated reo2 was oxidized to re2o7 by o2 dissolved in the water in the ambient condition previous studies reported that re2o7 could react with water furtherly to form reo4 re releasing into the solution 59 therefore long term standing experiments were carried out in the following to assess the oxidation and dissolution of reo2 adhered on the flocs at aerobic conditions fig 9 with the increased time of the solids standing in the solution the removal efficiency of re decreased slowly at low ph about 78 4 of the re removal efficiency was retained at ph 4 2 after 2 h late however the concentration of re in the aqueous solution was increased rapidly and reached equilibrium in about 2 h at high ph only 17 6 of re still adhered to the surface of flocs and the color of the flocs changed to yellow grey fig s1 for higher ph conditions both the formation of water soluble substances reo oh 3 and dissolution of re2o7 resulted in a significant decrease in the removal efficiency of re compared to another ph 59 above of all the reaction route during the reduction coagulation process can be represented by the following equations 1 ti 3 3 h 2 o ti oh 3 3 h 2 h reo 4 3 ti oh 3 h 2 o reo 2 3 ti oh 4 3 4 reo 2 3 o 2 2 re 2 o 7 4 re 2 o 7 h 2 o 2 hreo 4 3 4 3 coagulation mechanism zeta potentials of the flocs surface in the reduction coagulation experiments under different ph as shown in fig 10 zeta potentials of the surface of the flocs changed from positive to negative and gradually decreased with ph increased the initial zeta potential was 30 6 mv without added naoh solution however as ph increased to 4 2 6 2 zeta potentials dropped rapidly and became negative and the appearance of flocs could be observed in the solution at this time with ph increased to an alkaline environment zeta potentials once again underwent a rapid decrease process and then remained relatively stable hussain et al reported that the isoelectric point of ti iii flocs was ph 3 0 which was a little lower than the isoelectric point ph 3 8 in this experiment 42 this may be caused by the combination of flocs with in situ formed reo2 as the ph increased from 2 2 to 6 2 the zeta potential decreased from 30 6 mv to 9 8 mv and the coagulation effect was also significantly improved the results indicated that charge neutralization might be the critical mechanism of the coagulation process in this reduction coagulation experiment based on the experimental results of reduction and coagulation and various characterizations of the reaction products the mechanism of removing nh4reo4 by ticl3 is as follows fig 11 the first step is the adsorption reduction process ti iii began to react with h2o and then ti iii hydrolysates adsorb reo4 followed by an in situ oxidation reduction reaction reducing reo4 to reo2 in the coagulation process electrostatic interaction was the dominant force in coalescence of ti iv hydrolysates and reo2 after the reduction reaction and then the in situ generated composites aggregated with each other through nucleation and larger flocs formed which precipitated to remove reo2 at the aerobic condition the in situ formed reo2 may be oxidized and dissolution again generally compared with re the oxide properties of tc are more stable and the more oxidizing ions such as no3 have less interference with tc vii 2 60 therefore better results may be achieved when using ticl3 as a coagulant to treat wastewater containing tc vii consequently ticl3 may be a potential reagent to treat nuclear contaminated wastewater containing 99tc vii 4 summary in this study ticl3 was used as the experimental reagent to remove reo4 in the water during the experiment ticl3 serves as both a reducing agent and coagulant the experimental results show that under the condition of ph 6 2 0 2 and ti re 25 1 the removal efficiency of re can reach 99 9 after 6 min of coagulation and the separation of pollutants and water can be achieved quickly experiments have proved that under low ph conditions the increase in ph is conducive to the removal of reo4 and under high ph conditions it is on the contrary the coexisting ions so4 2 and clo4 will not have much influence on the removal of reo4 subsequent characterization proved that the hydrates of ticl3 could reduce reo4 to insoluble reo2 to achieve the removal of reo4 this study explicates that the ticl3 reduction coagulation method can effectively remove reo4 and is expected to be used as a treatment agent for 99tc containing wastewater which is of exceptional significance for treating nuclear wastewater declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and

13162,stimuli responsive separation materials with reversible wettability transition have been attracting increasing attention because they have excellent oil water separation performance in this study a facile and environmentally friendly approach was used to produce a quartz sand filter material with ph controllable wettability between superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity pei zno sa cs coated quartz sand filter material pei zno sa cs qs was fabricated by introducing zno nanoparticles hydrophobic alkyl long chain and

promising application prospects in on demand oil water separation and demulsification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords quartz sand filter material ph controllable wettability oil water separation demulsification 1 introduction with the fast development of global economy and the continuous improvement of industrialization degree petrochemicals printing and dyeing textile metal smelting and food processing industries have been produced a significant amount of oily wastewater with a complex composition 1 4 untreated oily wastewater have caused serious pollution and irreparable damage to the water environment and ecosystem thereby posing significant threats to the health of humans and the environment 5 6 currently traditional single type wettability materials cannot meet the requirements for the treatment of oily wastewater because of the complex oily wastewater components and the increasingly enhanced oil water discharge standards 7 11 therefore a multifunctional material that is able to separate oily wastewater and emulsions while absorbing dyes from wastewater simultaneously needed to be developed essentially oil water separation is a problem related to interface science 12 scientists introduced oil water separation materials with special wettability to prepare material surfaces with different wetting oil and water behaviors which achieved controllable oil water mixture separation through different wetting behaviors of materials on the oil and water 13 14 on the basis of this design concept oil water separation materials with special superwettability can be divided into three types superhydrophobic superoleophilic materials oil removing superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic materials water removing and stimuli responsive separation materials 14 superhydrophobic superoleophilic materials can be applied in heavy oil water separation and they can be easily polluted and blocked by oil and impurities in oil water separation leading to a rapid decrease in separation flux 15 17 although superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic materials are typically used for light oil water separation and can prevent the surface structure from being contaminated by oil this kind of materials pre wetting by water is necessary before oil water separation 18 19 moreover such materials require harsh preparation and preservation conditions 20 superhydrophobic superoleophilic materials and superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic materials have respective advantages in oil water separation and have been the subject of comprehensive development and application 21 23 but their restrictions of the unidirectional wettability have caused related shortcomings in efficient separation of complex oil water mixtures 24 stimuli responsive controllable separation materials combine the advantages of superhydrophobic superoleophilic materials and superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic materials and have been unique advantages for processing complex oil water mixtures 25 the magnetic fe3o4 la tio2 textile fabric with ph controllable wettability prepared by yan et al 26 had selective separation performance for oil water mixtures with efficiency higher than 99 and flux of up to 11 000 l m 2 h 1 for oil and the oil water separation efficiency remained above 98 after 25 wettability cycles ren et al 27 fabricated a unique ph responding bio based oil water separation tio2 sa cs coating material whose coating wettability can be changed from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity when treated with ammonia and the coating can restore its superhydrophobicity after heating treatment the controllable wettability has a high separation efficiency for oil water oil ternary mixture and oil water emulsion and the separation efficiency for oil water mixture remains higher than 95 after 20 rounds of wettability conversion cao et al 28 grafted dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate monomer on the surface of stainless steel composite mesh through photoinitiation free radical polymerization to synthesize the oil water separation filter with dual intelligent control of temperature and ph which can realize the transformation of wettability by adjusting the temperature and ph stimuli responsive controllable separation materials have attracted growing attention because of the wettability conversion characteristics and excellent oil water separation performance 29 these materials have been extensively applied in addressing oil spills and on demand oil water separation of industrial oily sewage discharge with broad application prospects the oil water separation materials such as cotton textile sponge activated carbon filter paper etc that are widely used nowadays generally have problems such as poor structure stability difficulty in recycling and repeated application and a tendency to cause secondary pollution easily so these materials are currently unable to meet the discharge standards and treatment requirements of the water treatment industry therefore finding an affordable filter material with good structural chemical stability and ability to confer environmental protection has a positive practical significance 30 31 in recent years hard quartz sand filter material has been widely used in treating oil bearing wastewater because it is affordable and has high structural stability and mechanical durability 32 33 therefore this study used quartz sand filter material as the base material a ph responsive controllable oil water separation pei zno sa cs qs was prepared in this study by grafting zinc oxide nanoparticles nps water soluble cationic polymer complex hydrophilic molecules and long carbon chain carboxylic acid on the surface of hard quartz sand through the application of a simple dip coating synthesis route scheme 1 zinc oxide nps with a rich surface structure were selected for the construction of rough nanostructures on the surface of the hard quartz sand the use of water soluble cationic polyethylene imine pei and the negative charge of the quartz sand surface of the strong electrostatic force introduces a large amount

a result pei zno sa cs qs has a positive adsorption effect on industrial dyes pei zno sa cs qs can be transformed from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity after ammonia treatment and the superhydrophobicity can be restored after heating treatment in addition the ph responsive surface of pei zno sa cs qs was used to separate oil water mixtures and separate water in oil emulsions and

outlet side with the superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity of pei zno sa cs qs the water phase cannot wet the filter material and only the oil flows into the beaker on the left through the filter material the right end of the device was the water outlet side and pei zno sa cs qs was loaded after wetted by ammonia water the oil phase in the oil water mixture was intercepted by the superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity of the filter material and only the water phase can infiltrate the filter material and flow into the beaker on the right the ratio of 1 1 v v 120 ml of oil water mixture was poured in the device from the upper interface of the oil water separation device and the oil phase and water phase were then flowed out from the left and right ends of the filter column of the device respectively the separation efficiency and separation flux are the key indexes to accurately evaluate the oil water separation performance of pei zno sa cs qs the oil content and the water content of the filtrate on the effluent side should be detected to ensure the accurate evaluation of the oil water separation efficiency of pei zno sa cs qs oil content can be measured by using a total carbon and total nitrogen analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena jena germany for oil content assessment and water content can be measured by a moisture meter sn ws200a qingdao sunde environmental protection technology co ltd qingdao china for oil content measurement separation efficiency was calculated by the following formula 1 η water c oi c ot c oi 100 2 η 0 il c wi c wt c wi 100 where η water and η 0il are the oil separation efficiency of filtered water and the water separation efficiency of filtered oil respectively c oi and c wi are oil content and water content of oil water mixture mg l 1 respectively c ot and c wt are the oil content in the filtered water and the water content in the filtered oil mg l 1 respectively the separation flux of the filter material on the water and oil outlet sides was calculated according to the collected permeation volume of water or oil in the unit time of the effective flow area on the water and oil outlet sides the calculation formula of separation flux l m 2 h 1 is as follows 3 flux v s t where v is the volume of permeable liquid l s is the effective separation area m2 and δt is the penetration time h the intrusion pressure of the filter material to water and oil needs to be measured to further examine the oil water separation efficiency of the modified quartz sand filter material liquid pressure on the material surface is directly proportional to the liquid height thus the experimental value of the filter material intrusion pressure p exp can be expressed by the maximum height of the liquid supported on the material surface h max with the following formula 4 p exp ρg h max where p exp is the intrusion pressure of the filter material pa ρ is the liquid density kg m 3 g is the gravitational constant m s 2 h max is the maximum height of the intrusion liquid that the filter material can withstand m 2 7 adsorption dye experiment the standard curve method was used to determine the concentration of dye before and after adsorption a series of mb and cr dye reserve solutions with concentration gradient were prepared this solution could be diluted with distilled water to the experimental adsorption research range then 20 g of pei zno sa cs qs with the particle size ranging from 0 07 mm to 0 125 mm was placed in a syringe with 60 ml calibration afterward 30 ml of dye diluent was added and filtered according to gravity a total of 3 ml of filtrate was taken and the absorbance of the dye was measured at the corresponding wavelength by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 1800 shanghai mapstar instrument co ltd the corresponding dye concentration was calculated according to the labeled curve figures s1 and s2 and the removal rate η and adsorption capacity q e were calculated by the formulas as the following 5 η c i c e c i 100 6 q e c i c e m v where η is the removal rate of dye c i and c e are the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of the dye mg l 1 respectively q e is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 m is the mass of pei zno sa cs qs g and v is the volume of the dye solution l 2 8 demulsification of oil in water and water in oil emulsions a total of 10 g pei zno sa cs qs with the particle size range of 0 07 mm 0 125 mm was filled in a fixed filtration device then the separation of oil in water emulsion was conducted according to gravity in the oil removal mode the pei zno sa cs qs was pre wetted with oil and then 10 ml water in oil emulsion was filtered the water content was used to measure the water content in the oil before and after separation and then the separation efficiency of different water in oil emulsions was calculated in the form of rejection coefficient r the calculation equation is as follows 7 r 1 c p c o 100 where c o and c p are the water content in oil before and after emulsion separation mg l 1 pei zno sa cs qs with particle size of 0 07 mm 0 125 mm was filled in a fixed filter and pre wetted with 7 ml ammonia as a result the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs changed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity the emulsion was separated under full gravity conditions a total of 10 ml of oil in water emulsion was taken for filtration and the total organic carbon toc content of the emulsion before and after filtration was measured to calculate the separation efficiency by using the following formula 8 η o w c oi c oe c oi 100 where η o w is the separation efficiency of oil in water emulsion c oi is the oil content in oil in water emulsion before filtration mg l 1 c oe is the content of oil in the filtrate after demulsification mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of pei zno sa cs qs to realize the ph responsive reversible wettability conversion of pei zno sa cs qs the wettability conversion from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity was achieved by grafting the low surface energy groups and the stable ionizable carboxyl functional groups on the surface of the quartz sand the following formula explains the preparation mechanism of pei zno sa cs qs the relationship between contact angle and surface tension in the ideal state i e a smooth solid surface can be characterized by young s equation 34 9 cos θ γ s γ sl γ l where θ is the intrinsic contact angle of the liquid on the solid surface ica ca in the plane γ s and γ l are the tension on the surface of solid and liquid respectively and γ sl is the interfacial tension between solid and liquid phases the fabrication of superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity surface ica of relatively small oil and ica of large water should be obtained increasing the roughness of material surface can effectively strengthen the effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter material 35 the surface tension of water was higher than that of oil 36 37 thus the surface tension of the material is controlled between that of oil and water which means that a superhydrophobic superoleophilic surface can be obtained when the surface tension of the material is higher than that of oil and less than that of water therefore the experimental scheme in this study used the low surface energy sa with alkyl chain length of c18 to provide hydrophobic long chain and ionizable carboxylic acid group the reversible conversion of the surface wettability of the filter material was achieved by the protonation and deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group on the surface of the filter material 38 the introduction of zno nps on the surface of quartz sand caused two changes first rough nanostructures were constructed on the surface and second reaction sites oh were formed for the ph triggered wettability response and hydrophobic modification of the surface of filter material 39 with the introduction of strong electronegative amino groups on the surface of cs and pei molecules a rich functional group structure was provided while strengthening the adsorption effect of quartz sand on dyes and the superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity properties of the filter material were enhanced the reaction process of pei zno sa cs coating is shown in fig 2 this scheme applied a constant amount of zno nps and the wettability of the filter material surface was used as the basis for determining the molar ratio of cs and sa as shown in fig 3 a when n sa n cs 6 1 the wca and contact angle of underwater dichloroethane are both higher than 160 and the surface has the best superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity the mass ratio of cs and pei in the scheme was ascertained through dye adsorption experiment the ph value of pei zno sa cs qs in deionized water was close to 5 thus indicating that the environment was weakly acidic therefore the separation efficiency of the acidic anion dye cr was selected as the basis for determining of the experimental scheme as shown in fig 3 b in the weak acidic environment of ph 5 the ratio of m cs to m pei was small and the adsorption effect of cr dye was better with the gradual increase of the proportion of pei molecules the separation efficiency of cr dye was gradually flattened and the separation efficiency of dye reached more than 99 therefore from the economic point of view pei zno sa cs qs has the ideal economic adsorption effect on dyes when m cs m pei 1 4 in addition the dye adsorption of unmodified quartz sand was also studied when using the unmodified quartz sand the separation efficiency for cr dye was 10 7 moreover the dye adsorption effect was poor mainly because of the smooth surface of hard quartz sand and few adsorption sites 40 pei zno sa cs qs has overcome the shortcomings of hard quartz sand filter material the grafted pei and cs provided abundant functional group structures and active sites for dye adsorption therefore pei zno sa cs qs has a high removal rate and stable adsorption effect on industrial dyes in summary this study chose n sa n cs 6 1 m cs m pei 1 4 as the experimental synthesis scheme to prepare pei zno sa cs modified coating simple dip coating method was applied to make modifications on the hard quartz sand filter material 3 2 apparent morphology and chemical composition analysis of pei zno sa cs qs a systematic description of the wettability response mechanism of pei zno sa cs qs was provided through the characterization of the morphology and chemical composition of pei zno sa cs qs sem was employed to characterize the microstructure and structure of unmodified quartz sand zinc oxide coated quartz sand and pei zno sa cs qs sem micrographs revealed that the pei zno sa cs qs surface had a larger number of microparticles and nps with a rough structure fig 4 a f than the unmodified quartz sand to characterize the structure and the chemical composition of the coating more accurately the xps of pei zno sa cs coating was illustrated the three main peaks of xps spectra of pei zno sa cs coating were o1s c1s and n1s as shown in fig 5 a d fig 5 b indicates that o1s is a multi element spectra and the peaks centered at 531 05 ev 530 35 ev and 529 6 ev fitted to zn o c zn oh and zn o zn 41 which further suggests the successful grafting of zno nps onto the surface of hard quartz sand fig 5 c shows the c1s multi element spectra and the peaks concentrated at 286 9 ev 283 8 ev and 282 8 ev correspond to cc ch co and coo 40 the above multicomponent c1s spectra were derived from the complexation of zno and the cooh group in sa which is the crucial factor in the switching wettability of pei zno sa cs coating in ph response as shown in fig 5 e the eds element determination results are consistent with the xps spectra indicating that c o n and zn were uniformly coated on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs this condition shows that pei zno sa cs coating was grafted successfully on the surface of hard quartz sand through dip coating fig 5 f explores the functional group structure composition of pei zno sa cs coating the strong absorption peak at 3464 cm 1 was the stretching vibration peak of the oh group and the bending vibration peak at 1870 cm 1 was the bending vibration peak of the oh group which was primarily originated from the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups grafted on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs pei zno sa cs qs has more abundant chemical functional groups than the surface of unmodified quartz sand the strong absorption peaks at 2857 cm 1 and 2924 cm 1 were derived from the ch stretching vibration of ch3 and ch2 groups in sa of pei zno sa cs coating 42 the strong absorption peak at 471 cm 1 was the vibration absorption peak of zno which further indicates the successful coating of zno nps on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs the absorption peak at 1617 cm 1 was the co stretching vibration absorption peak in cooh 43 indicating that cooh group in sa was grafted onto the surface of zinc oxide coated pei zno sa cs qs successfully the absorption peaks at 1409 1549 cm 1 were derived from the cc stretching vibration in the benzene ring skeleton indicating that cs molecules with a benzene ring structure were grafted fig 5 g presents the xrd patterns of pei zno sa cs qs zno coated quartz sand and unmodified quartz sand pei zno sa cs qs and zno coated quartz sand and unmodified quartz sand had similar characteristic diffraction peaks such similarity indicates that zno nps were grafted on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs successfully and the surface structure of the original quartz sand filter material was retained in the surface modification process in addition the thermogravimetric analysis tga shows that the weight ratio of pei zno sa cs coating to pei zno sa cs qs was 17 21 wt fig 5 h demonstrating that pei zno sa cs qs has good thermal stability unmodified quartz sand has the characteristics of high temperature resistance and small thermal expansion coefficient so in the process of rising from low temperature to high temperature its quality was stable without obvious decline 3 3 stimuli responsive wettability transition stimuli responsive separation materials with reversible wettability transition have been the subject of increasing attention in recent years due to their novel wettability transition mechanism and excellent oil water separation performance when evaluating the wetting responsivity of pei zno sa cs qs pei zno sa cs qs was adhered to the glass slide and the static wca and the retention time of water on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs were measured after the water droplets with different ph values performed wetting as shown in fig 6 a the reversible wettability switch of pei zno sa cs qs can also be evaluated by measuring the uwoca of dichloromethane oil droplets under water to determine the uwoca and the retention time of dichloromethane dichloromethane oil droplets were dropped onto a quartz glass dish that contained water of different ph values for 30 s as shown in fig 6 b the ph range of the aqueous solution was 1 13 indicating strong acid to strong alkaline conditions this finding further verifies the acid and alkalinity resistance of pei zno sa cs qs when the ph was less than or equal to 7 wca was above 158 and uwoca was close to 0 demonstrating excellent hydrophobic and lipophilic effects as the ph increased the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs transformed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity when ph 11 wca was close to 0 and uwoca was above 151 which indicates that pei zno sa cs qs has good superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity wettability stability and alkali corrosion resistance in alkaline environments when ph 8 the wca of pei zno sa cs qs gradually increased as the ph increased uwoca tended to be stable and the hydrophilic rate of pei zno sa cs qs gradually increased when the ph was 13 the wca of pei zno sa cs qs decreased from 133 to 0 in 30 s fig 6 a demonstrating the sensitive wettability responsiveness of pei zno sa cs qs more advanced research progress has been achieved in this respect in comparison with the conversion time of wetting responsiveness of hard filter media reported in previous literature 29 44 45 the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs can be switched by water wetting at different ph and the switch is cyclic and reversible pei zno sa cs qs was placed on a slide and the ph value of the water was modified to 7 or 13 successively the cycle was repeated 10 times during which the wca changes of the water droplets on the surface of the filter material were recorded fig 6 c shows that the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs remains reversible between superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity after 10 cycles of wettability transformation demonstrating satisfactory reversible transitional wettability and wettability stability the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs can also be transformed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity after the material was treated with ammonia for 30 s pei zno sa cs qs was tiled in a quartz glass dish that contained ammonia and dichloromethane was dropped on this dish the uwoca of dichloromethane was higher than 159 the uwoca of organic reagents with different surface tensions was tested for the evaluation of the underwater superoleophobicity properties of ammonia treated pei zno sa cs qs fig 6 d suggests that the uwoca of different organic liquids on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs wetted by ammonia water was higher than 155 suggesting excellent underwater superoleophobicity after the pei zno sa cs qs infiltrated by ammonia water was heated at the temperature of 80 c for 15 min the ammonia molecules adsorbed on the coating surface would volatilize and spill over the coating as a result the hydrophilicity of the filter material surface would weaken and the surface of the material would become superhydrophobic superoleophilic again the wettability transformation of pei zno sa cs qs can be achieved by converting the ammonia and heating treatment the reversible transformation of surface wettability of pei zno sa cs qs in response to ph and ammonia stimuli is shown in fig 6 e the mechanism of the switchable wettability response of pei zno sa cs qs to ph and ammonia 46 48 is as follows 10 11 12 13 the condensation reaction between zno nps and sa yields zinc stearate coordination compounds 46 as indicated in formula 10 when solution ph changes it would lead to the chelation and cracking of zinc carboxylate as shown in formulas 10 11 showing two different states of protonation cooh and deprotonation coo simultaneously with the change in the molecular morphology and free energy of the surface coating the macroscopic expression was the change of surface wettability the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs was characterized by ph responsiveness after the material was treated with ammonia the coordination bonds of zinc carboxylate on pei zno sa cs qs were broken and a new ammonium carboxylate ligand formed 49 as shown in formulas 12 and 13 such changes caused the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs to convert from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity 49 according to owens and wendt 50 the surface tension was equivalent to the total contributions to the surface of the different intermolecular forces 51 therefore formula 9 can be rewritten as 14 γ l 1 cos θ 2 γ s d γ l d 2 γ s p γ l p where superscript d and p denote the dispersion force component and polar force component of the tension on the surface respectively according to formula 14 contact angle of water can be expressed as 15 cos θ w 2 γ s d γ w d 2 γ s p γ w p γ w 1 where θ w is the icas of water and γ w is the surface tension of water according to formula 12 ch3 ch2 16coonh4 was present in the ammonia treated pei zno sa cs coating nh4 in ch3 ch2 16coonh4 increased γ s p thereby increasing the polarity of the coating surface in turn causing the hydrophilicity of the coating to improve due to the introduction of nh4 the coating surface has a large γ s p and a relatively small γ s d such features meet the conditions for the existence of superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic surface therefore the surface wettability of pei zno sa cs qs was transformed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity the influence of ammonia treatment on wettability switching of pei zno sa cs qs was evaluated through contact angle analysis for pei zno sa cs qs after five rounds of ammonia treatment wettability cycling switching as shown in fig 6 f after treated with five cycles of ammonia the wca of pei zno sa cs qs was above 160 showing good wetting stability in addition to further investigate the effect of ammonia treatment on the structure and chemical composition of pei zno sa cs coating the pei zno sa cs coating before and after ammonia treatment was characterized by xps and ft ir fig 6 g shows that o1s c1s zn2p n1s and other main peaks of pei zno sa cs coating were detected before and after ammonia treatment next the n1s peak of xps of pei zno sa cs coating before and after ammonia treatment was compared and analyzed considering the effect of ammonia treatment on the chemical composition of the modified coating fig 6 h the n1s spectra of xps on the pei zno sa cs qs surface can be divided into two components the fitting peaks centered on 397 65 ev and 398 55 ev correspond to the nh in the pei molecule and the nh in the benzene ring group in the cs molecule respectively findings showed that pei and cs molecules were successfully grafted onto the surface of pei zno sa cs qs a new fitting peak of nh4 centered on 399 45 ev was added to the n1s spectra because of the complexation of nh3 and sa groups on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs after ammonia treatment as shown in fig 6 h the appearance of the nh4 fitting peak indicates that nh4 was in ch3 ch2 16coonh4 which verified the above wettability conversion principle in addition the infrared spectrum of wettability switching cycles for three times after ammonia treatment fig 6 i showed that the absorption peaks of υn h and δn h were present at 3001 cm 1 and 1455 cm 1 in the ammonia water infiltration of pei zno sa cs qs 46 this finding further indicated that nh3 penetrated the filter material coating and reacted which changed the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs 3 4 dye adsorption by pei zno sa cs qs the schiff base reaction 54 55 between cs and pei molecules fig 7 a further enhanced the adsorption of industrial dyes on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs the adsorption between acidic anionic dye congo red cr basic cationic dye methylene blue mb and pei zno sa cs qs will fluctuate noticeably affected by the ph value of the solution which is a variable factor that needs to be taken into account in the adsorption experiments figure s3 fig 7 b indicates the adsorption effect of pei zno sa cs qs on mb dye was enhanced as the solution ph increased and the dye separation efficiency was increased gradually for an alkaline solution the dye separation efficiency was flattened and the dye removal rate was 98 57 at a solution ph of 8 with the gradual increase in the solution ph the adsorption trend of the adsorption curve of cr dye differed from that of mb the separation efficiency of cr dye decreased gradually and then flattened at a solution ph of 14 the separation efficiency of cr dye was 98 57 at a ph less than 7 the surface of pei zno sa cs qs was protonated and the adsorption process was blocked by the electrostatic repulsion action between pei zno sa cs qs and the positively charged basic cationic dye mb meanwhile the dye separation efficiency decreased and the adsorption effect was worsened when the ph of the solution rose to the point of alkalinity the protons on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs were looted by oh in the solution and the surface of pei zno sa cs qs was in the state of deprotonation which enhanced the electronegativity on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs and the adsorption of mb on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs was enhanced gradually under the action of electrostatic attraction the adsorption effect of pei zno sa cs qs on the mb dye improved further along with the adsorption effect on the mb dye in an acidic state or at a low ph the acid anion cr dye and the protonated pei zno sa cs qs had a strong electrostatic attraction which further increased the adsorption of pei zno sa cs qs to the cr dye when the ph of the solution was 5 the removal rate of the cr dye was 99 43 the experimental results show that pei zno sa cs qs has a satisfactory removal effect on industrial dyes 3 5 stimuli responsive controllable oil water separation of pei zno sa cs qs this scheme uses the oil water separation device which can separate the water and oil phases of the mixture at the same time efficiently and continuously and has simplified traditional oil water separation process 52 53 simultaneous oil water separation was performed for the mixture of oil and water fig 8 a fig 8 b shows that when the particle size of pei zno sa cs qs is 0 3 0 6 mm the water separation efficiency was greater than 99 23 the water flux reached 6935 200 l m 2 h 1 and the oil separation efficiency was greater than 99 13 affected by the oil viscosity and surface tension the oil flux ranged from 2641 89 to 8143 26 l m 2 h 1 and the oil flux varied considerably as the oil viscosity changed compared with the traditional vertical separation device the oil water separation device was less affected by gravity and more affected by oil viscosity 2 the influence of cyclic wettability change of pei zno sa cs qs on oil water separation was then evaluated for this purpose water removing type pei zno sa cs qs and oil removing type pei zno sa cs qs with cyclic wettability change were filled at both ends of the type device for simultaneous oil water separation of the dichlorethane water mixture pei zno sa cs qs achieved a higher than 98 89 oil water separation efficiency after 10 cycles of wettability conversion and the oil water separation flux did not decrease significantly fig 8 c this phenomenon shows that pei zno sa cs qs has good switchable wettability and wettability stability thus providing a new reference direction for the constant and efficient oil water separation of the quartz sand filter material 3 6 self cleaning and wetting stability of pei zno sa cs qs surface the wca and uwoca and water resistance and oil resistant hydrostatic strength of pei zno sa cs qs were measured for further evaluation of the oil water separation performance of pei zno sa cs qs the surface of pei zno sa cs qs shows superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity in acidic and neutral environments thus the surface can resist wetting by industrial dye wastewater the uwoca of pei zno sa cs qs was higher than 155 after undergoing pre wetting with oil the maximum water support height of pei zno sa cs qs after n hexane wetting was 21 8 cm formula 4 indicates that the intrusion pressure of the filter material was about 2 14 kpa suggesting good water retention ability and hydrophobic performance which is shown in fig 9 a in alkaline environments the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs surface changed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity therefore the surface can stand up to wetting of different oils the contact angles of n hexane petroleum ether liquid paraffin hexadecane diesel dichloroethane and trichloromethane were greater than 153 fig 9 b n hexane had a maximum support height of approximately 18 5 cm after the filter material was wetted by ammonia water and the corresponding intrusion pressure was about 1 813 kpa this finding suggests that pei zno sa cs qs has improved pollution resistance and good self cleaning performance in the oil water separation link the above results suggest that pei zno sa cs qs has good ph response wettability conversion and self cleaning anti pollution performance the mechanical durability and anti corrosion ability of pei zno sa cs qs were explored to evaluate the wetting stability of pei zno sa cs qs as shown in fig 9 c after pei zno sa cs qs was ultrasonically oscillated for 48 h and then wetted with acidic water and ammonia water wca on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs was around 158 and uwoca was higher than 158 compared with pei zno sa cs qs without ultrasonic treatment the wca and uwoca on the surface of the filter material decreased within the range of 2 with a relatively slow overall trend of change exhibiting good mechanical durability to evaluate the anti corrosion ability of pei zno sa cs qs pei zno sa cs qs was immersed in sdbs and nacl solution with a certain concentration gradient for 12 h afterward it was dried in an oven at 80 c for 9 h and it was wetted with ammonia and acid water respectively the wca on the surface of the filter material was higher than 158 and uwoca was within 159 161 after treatment the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs remained in the range that corresponds to superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity these experimental results show that pei zno sa cs coating can exist stably in a surfactant rich solution showing good wetting stability and that it can separate surfactant stabilized oil water mixture 3 7 separation of oil water emulsions by pei zno sa cs qs pei zno sa cs qs can reversibly convert superhydrophobic superoleophilic surfaces into superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic surfaces within 10 s thus oil in water emulsions and water in oil emulsions were demulsified through the switchable surface wettability toward water and oil liu et al 56 stated that the pore size of the modified filter material greatly affected the separation of oil water emulsions different particle sizes of pei zno sa cs qs were used to filter and separate diesel in water emulsion for verification of the influence of particle size of pei zno sa cs qs on the separation efficiency of oil water emulsion fig 10 reflects that the separation efficiency of diesel in water emulsion decrease gradually with the increase of pei zno sa cs qs particle size the separation efficiency is up to 99 17 when the particle size is 0 7 0 125 mm therefore pei zno sa cs qs with a particle size range of 0 7 0 125 mm was selected to separate oil water emulsions the oil water emulsions was observed before and after separation by using an optical microscope to examine the demulsification effect of pei zno sa cs qs on oil water emulsions the oil water emulsions was turbid before separation and it became clear and transparent after filtration microscopic images show that dense emulsion droplets were present in the emulsions before filtration these droplets disappeared after filtration figs 11 a e and 12 a e findings show that 0 7 0 125 mm pei zno sa cs qs has a positive demulsification and separation effect on oil water emulsions figure s4 showed the demulsification mechanism of oil in water emulsions when the oily wastewater after emulsification was poured into the filter column the continuous water phase passed through the filter layer affected by the gravity and capillary pressure θa water 90 δpwater 0 and the oil beads were intercepted by the pore of the filter bed because of the superoleophobic effect of filter media surface on oil θa oil 90 δpoil 0 with the filtration going on the oily wastewater volume decreased and the oil concentration increased constantly when the subsequent oil droplets contacted with the intercepted oil droplets the coalescence effect caused the size of oil droplets gradually increased when the oil beads on the filter column surface coalesced gradually and increased a continuous oil phase was formed the above separation performance confirmed that the pei zno sa cs qs can separate the micro nanosized oil droplets from water effectively moreover the demulsification process of surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsion was achieved by pei zno sa cs qs which was treated by the transition of ph responsive wettability the above experimental results show that pei zno sa cs qs showed excellent demulsification effect on surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsion and the demulsification mechanism of water in oil emulsion is quite close to that of oil in water emulsion the demulsification mechanism for water in oil emulsion is shown in figure s5 to characterize the separation ability of pei zno sa cs qs in a profound way dynamic light scattering dls tests were conducted on the five emulsions before and after separation the particle size distribution of five water in oil emulsions before and after filtration by pei zno sa cs qs is presented in fig 11 f k the particle size of the emulsion was between 300 and 1400 nm and that of the filtrate was between 1 and 4 nm prior to filtration in general pei zno sa cs qs has a good separation effect on water in oil emulsion as indicated by the experiment results the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs was transformed into superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity after the material was infiltrated by ammonia water which can possibly result in the demulsification of surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsion the particle size distribution of five oil in water emulsions before and after filtration by pei zno sa cs qs is shown in fig 12 f k before filtration the particle size of the emulsion ranged from 300 nm to 1400 nm and the filtrate size ranged from 1 nm to 5 nm thereby indicating a positive demulsification separation effect in summary pei zno sa cs qs has a perfect separation effect on oil in water emulsion the separation flux and separation efficiency of oil in water and water in oil emulsion were analyzed numerically for further evaluation of the separation effect of pei zno sa cs qs on oil water emulsion as suggested in fig 11 k the separation efficiency of pei zno sa cs qs for water in oil emulsion is larger than 98 and the separation flux ranged from 997 25 to 1423 406 l m 2 h 1 the separation efficiency of pei zno sa cs qs for oil in water emulsion was higher than 98 79 and the separation flux ranged from 1228 9 to 1443 8 l m 2 h 1 fig 12 k the physicochemical properties of oil products had a large effect on the flux of water in oil emulsion in general a high viscosity oil corresponds to a low separation flux yet the flux is still higher than that reported in other published studies 29 32 41 in conclusion pei zno sa cs qs has high separation efficiency and separation flux for on demand oil water emulsion separation which can provide a new reference direction for the separation of oil water emulsion by using rigid filter materials 4 conclusion pei zno sa cs qs with switchable wettability properties was synthesized through the use of a simple dip coating method the ph responsive pei zno sa cs qs can be transformed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity when the modified material was treated with ammonia and it can regain its superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity after heating treatment pei zno sa cs qs has good self cleaning and wetting stability and it can achieve oil water separation efficiency of about 98 89 after 10 wettability cycles of transition in addition pei zno sa cs qs has high separation efficiency and stable adsorption effect on mb and cr dyes it is a filter material with two functions namely continuous separation of oil water and dye adsorption because of the rich functional unity on the pei zno sa cs qs surface and ph switchable wettability simultaneous and continuous oil water mixture separation can be realized with a good separation effect on

13162,stimuli responsive separation materials with reversible wettability transition have been attracting increasing attention because they have excellent oil water separation performance in this study a facile and environmentally friendly approach was used to produce a quartz sand filter material with ph controllable wettability between superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and

promising application prospects in on demand oil water separation and demulsification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords quartz sand filter material ph controllable wettability oil water separation demulsification 1 introduction with the fast development of global economy and the continuous improvement of industrialization degree petrochemicals printing and dyeing textile metal smelting and food processing industries have been produced a significant amount of oily wastewater with a complex composition 1 4 untreated oily wastewater have caused serious pollution and irreparable damage to the water environment and ecosystem thereby posing significant threats to the health of humans and the environment 5 6 currently traditional single type wettability materials cannot meet the requirements for the treatment of oily wastewater because of the complex oily wastewater components and the increasingly enhanced oil water discharge standards 7 11 therefore a multifunctional material that is able to separate oily wastewater and emulsions while absorbing dyes from wastewater simultaneously needed to be developed essentially oil water separation is a problem related to interface science 12 scientists introduced oil water separation materials with special wettability to prepare material surfaces with different wetting oil and water behaviors which achieved controllable oil water mixture separation through different wetting behaviors of materials on the oil and water 13 14 on the basis of this design concept oil water separation materials with special superwettability can be divided into three types superhydrophobic superoleophilic materials oil removing superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic materials water removing and stimuli responsive separation materials 14 superhydrophobic superoleophilic materials can be applied in heavy oil water separation and they can be easily polluted and blocked by oil and impurities in oil water separation leading to a rapid decrease in separation flux 15 17 although superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic materials are typically used for light oil water separation and can prevent the surface structure from being contaminated by oil this kind of materials pre wetting by water is necessary before oil water separation 18 19 moreover such materials require harsh preparation and preservation conditions 20 superhydrophobic superoleophilic materials and superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic materials have respective advantages in oil water separation and have been the subject of comprehensive development and application 21 23 but their restrictions of the unidirectional wettability have caused related shortcomings in efficient separation of complex oil water mixtures 24 stimuli responsive controllable separation materials combine the advantages of superhydrophobic superoleophilic materials and superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic materials and have been unique advantages for processing complex oil water mixtures 25 the magnetic fe3o4 la tio2 textile fabric with ph controllable wettability prepared by yan et al 26 had selective separation performance for oil water mixtures with efficiency higher than 99 and flux of up to 11 000 l m 2 h 1 for oil and the oil water separation efficiency remained above 98 after 25 wettability cycles ren et al 27 fabricated a unique ph responding bio based oil water separation tio2 sa cs coating material whose coating wettability can be changed from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity when treated with ammonia and the coating can restore its superhydrophobicity after heating treatment the controllable wettability has a high separation efficiency for oil water oil ternary mixture and oil water emulsion and the separation efficiency for oil water mixture remains higher than 95 after 20 rounds of wettability conversion cao et al 28 grafted dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate monomer on the surface of stainless steel composite mesh through photoinitiation free radical polymerization to synthesize the oil water separation filter with dual intelligent control of temperature and ph which can realize the transformation of wettability by adjusting the temperature and ph stimuli responsive controllable separation materials have attracted growing attention because of the wettability conversion characteristics and excellent oil water separation performance 29 these materials have been extensively applied in addressing oil spills and on demand oil water separation of industrial oily sewage discharge with broad application prospects the oil water separation materials such as cotton textile sponge activated carbon filter paper etc that are widely used nowadays generally have problems such as poor structure stability difficulty in recycling and repeated application and a tendency to cause secondary pollution easily so these materials are currently unable to meet the discharge standards and treatment requirements of the water treatment industry therefore finding an affordable filter material with good structural chemical stability and ability to confer environmental protection has a positive practical significance 30 31 in recent years hard quartz sand filter material has been widely used in treating oil bearing wastewater because it is affordable and has high structural stability and mechanical durability 32 33 therefore this study used quartz sand filter material as the base material a ph responsive controllable oil water separation pei zno

quartz sand through the application of a simple dip coating synthesis route scheme 1 zinc oxide nps with a rich surface structure were selected for the construction of rough nanostructures on the surface of the hard quartz sand the use of water soluble cationic polyethylene imine pei and the negative charge of the quartz sand surface of the strong electrostatic force introduces a large amount of amino groups enriches the functional group structure of the quartz sand and enhances the quartz sand surface and stearic acid sa chitosan cs hydrolysis condensation reaction and hydrogen bonding as a result pei zno sa cs qs has a positive adsorption effect on industrial dyes pei zno sa cs qs can be transformed from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity after ammonia treatment and the superhydrophobicity can be restored after heating treatment in addition the ph responsive surface of pei zno sa cs qs was used to separate oil water mixtures and separate water in oil emulsions and oil in water emulsions effectively before and after conversion of wettability 2 experimental section 2 1 materials zno nanoparticles nps with the mean diameter of 30 10 nm polyethylene imine pei mw

water and water in oil emulsions the preparation of surfactant stabilized oil water emulsion was as follows oil and water were mixed in a round bottom flask at a 1 20 v v ratio then sdbs with a concentration of 0 04 mg ml 1 was added and stirred continuously at room temperature at a high speed for 8 h to prepare the surfactant stable oil in water emulsion similarly oil and water were mixed in a round bottom flask at a 20 1 v v ratio and sds with a concentration of 0 04 mg ml 1 was added and subjected to continuous high speed stirring at room temperature for 8 h to prepare the surfactant stable water in oil emulsion five water in oil emulsions were prepared in this scheme including water in diesel emulsion water in hexadecane emulsion water in gasoline emulsion water in petroleum ether emulsion and water in dichloroethane emulsion there were five types of oil in water emulsions i e diesel in water emulsion hexadecane in water emulsion petroleum ether in water emulsion peanut oil in water emulsion and dichloroethane in water emulsion the prepared emulsions were then stored at room temperature for 20 h without stratification and transparency 2 6 separation of oil water mixtures as shown in fig 1 a type oil water separation device in this scheme was used to perform continuous separation of oil water mixture the two ends of the type oil water separation device were loaded with pei zno sa cs qs under different wettability conditions which can synchronously separate the water phase and oil phase of the oil water mixture the left end of the device was the oil outlet side with the superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity of pei zno sa cs qs the water phase cannot wet the filter material and only the oil flows into the beaker on the left through the filter material the right end of the device was the water outlet side and pei zno sa cs qs was loaded after wetted by ammonia water the oil phase in the oil water mixture was intercepted by the superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity of the filter material and only the water phase can infiltrate the filter material and flow into the beaker on the right the ratio of 1 1 v v 120 ml of oil water mixture was poured in the device from the upper interface of the oil water separation device and the oil phase and water phase were then flowed out from the left and right ends of the filter column of the device respectively the separation efficiency and separation flux are the key indexes to accurately evaluate the oil water separation performance of pei zno sa cs qs the oil content and the water content of the filtrate on the effluent side should be detected to ensure the accurate evaluation of the oil water separation efficiency of pei zno sa cs qs oil content can be measured by using a total carbon and total nitrogen analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena jena germany for oil content assessment and water content can be measured by a moisture meter sn ws200a qingdao sunde environmental protection technology co ltd qingdao china for oil content measurement separation efficiency was calculated by the following formula 1 η water c oi c ot c oi 100 2 η 0 il c wi c wt c wi 100 where η water and η 0il are the oil separation efficiency of filtered water and the water separation efficiency of filtered oil respectively c oi and c wi are oil content and water content of oil water mixture mg l 1 respectively c ot and c wt are the oil content in the filtered water and the water content in the filtered oil mg l 1 respectively the separation flux of the filter material on the water and oil outlet sides was calculated according to the collected permeation volume of water or oil in the unit time of the effective flow area on the water and oil outlet sides the calculation formula of separation flux l m 2 h 1 is as follows 3 flux v s t where v is the volume of permeable liquid l s is the effective separation area m2 and δt is the penetration time h the intrusion pressure of the filter material to water and oil needs to be measured to further examine the oil water separation efficiency of the modified quartz sand filter material liquid pressure on the material surface is directly proportional to the liquid height thus the experimental value of the filter material intrusion pressure p exp can be expressed by the maximum height of the liquid supported on the material surface h max with the following formula 4 p exp ρg h max where p exp is the intrusion pressure of the filter material pa ρ is the liquid density kg m 3 g is the gravitational constant m s 2 h max is the maximum height of the intrusion liquid that the filter material can withstand m 2 7 adsorption dye experiment the standard curve method was used to determine the concentration of dye before and after adsorption a series of mb and cr dye reserve solutions with concentration gradient were prepared this solution could be diluted with distilled water to the experimental adsorption research range then 20 g of pei zno sa cs qs with the particle size ranging from 0 07 mm to 0 125 mm was placed in a syringe with 60 ml calibration afterward 30 ml of dye diluent was added and filtered according to gravity a total of 3 ml of filtrate was taken and the absorbance of the dye was measured at the corresponding wavelength by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 1800 shanghai mapstar instrument co ltd the corresponding dye concentration was calculated according to the labeled curve figures s1 and s2 and the removal rate η and adsorption capacity q e were calculated by the formulas as the following 5 η c i c e c i 100 6 q e c i c e m v where η is the removal rate of dye c i and c e are the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of the dye mg l 1 respectively q e is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 m is the mass of pei zno sa cs qs g and v is the volume of the dye solution l 2 8 demulsification of oil in water and water in oil emulsions a total of 10 g pei zno sa cs qs with the particle size range of 0 07 mm 0 125 mm was filled in a fixed filtration device then the separation of oil in water emulsion was conducted according to gravity in the oil removal mode the pei zno sa cs qs was pre wetted with oil and then 10 ml water in oil emulsion was filtered the water content was used to measure the water content in the oil before and after separation and then the separation efficiency of different water in oil emulsions was calculated in the form of rejection coefficient r the calculation equation is as follows 7 r 1 c p c o 100 where c o and c p are the water content in oil before and after emulsion separation mg l 1 pei zno sa cs qs with particle size of 0 07 mm 0 125 mm was filled in a fixed filter and pre wetted with 7 ml ammonia as a result the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs changed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity the emulsion was separated under full gravity conditions a total of 10 ml of oil in water emulsion was taken for filtration and the total organic carbon toc content of the emulsion before and after filtration was measured to calculate the separation efficiency by using the following formula 8 η o w c oi c oe c oi 100 where η o w is the separation efficiency of oil in water emulsion c oi is the oil content in oil in water emulsion before filtration mg l 1 c oe is the content of oil in the filtrate after demulsification mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of pei zno sa cs qs to realize the ph responsive reversible wettability conversion of pei zno sa cs qs the wettability conversion from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity was achieved by grafting the low surface energy groups and the stable ionizable carboxyl functional groups on the surface of the quartz sand the following formula explains the preparation mechanism of pei zno sa cs qs the relationship between contact angle and surface tension in the ideal state i e a smooth solid surface can be characterized by young s equation 34 9 cos θ γ s γ sl γ l where θ is the intrinsic contact angle of the liquid on the solid surface ica ca in the plane γ s and γ l are the tension on the surface of solid and liquid respectively and γ sl is the interfacial tension between solid and liquid phases the fabrication of superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity surface ica of relatively small oil and ica of large water should be obtained increasing the roughness of material surface can effectively strengthen the effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter material 35 the surface tension of water was higher than that of oil 36 37 thus the surface tension of the material is controlled between that of oil and water which means that a superhydrophobic superoleophilic surface can be obtained when the surface tension of the material is higher than that of oil and less than that of water therefore the experimental scheme in this study used the low surface energy sa with alkyl chain length of c18 to provide hydrophobic long chain and ionizable carboxylic acid group the reversible conversion of the surface wettability of the filter material was achieved by the protonation and deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group on the surface of the filter material 38 the introduction of zno nps on the surface of quartz sand caused two changes first rough nanostructures were constructed on the surface and second reaction sites oh were formed for the ph triggered wettability response and hydrophobic modification of the surface of filter material 39 with the introduction of strong electronegative amino groups on the surface of cs and pei molecules a rich functional group structure was provided while strengthening the adsorption effect of quartz sand on dyes and the superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity properties of the filter material were enhanced the reaction process of pei zno sa cs coating is shown in fig 2 this scheme applied a constant amount of zno nps and the wettability of the filter material surface was used as the basis for determining the molar ratio of cs and sa as shown in fig 3 a when n sa n cs 6 1 the wca and contact angle of underwater dichloroethane are both higher than 160 and the surface has the best superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity the mass ratio of cs and pei in the scheme was ascertained through dye adsorption experiment the ph value of pei zno sa cs qs in deionized water was close to 5 thus indicating that the environment was weakly acidic therefore the separation efficiency of the acidic anion dye cr was selected as the basis for determining of the experimental scheme as shown in fig 3 b in the weak acidic environment of ph 5 the ratio of m cs to m pei was small and the adsorption effect of cr dye was better with the gradual increase of the proportion of pei molecules the separation efficiency of cr dye was gradually flattened and the separation efficiency of dye reached more than 99 therefore from the economic point of view pei zno sa cs qs has the ideal economic adsorption effect on dyes when m cs m pei 1 4 in addition the dye adsorption of unmodified quartz sand was also studied when using the unmodified quartz sand the separation efficiency for cr dye was 10 7 moreover the dye adsorption effect was poor mainly because of the smooth surface of hard quartz sand and few adsorption sites 40 pei zno sa cs qs has overcome the shortcomings of hard quartz sand filter material the grafted pei and cs provided abundant functional group structures and active sites for dye adsorption therefore pei zno sa cs qs has a high removal rate and stable adsorption effect on industrial dyes in summary this study chose n sa n cs 6 1 m cs m pei 1 4 as the experimental synthesis scheme to prepare pei zno sa cs modified coating simple dip coating method was applied to make modifications on the hard quartz sand filter material 3 2 apparent morphology and chemical composition analysis of pei zno sa cs qs a systematic description of the wettability response mechanism of pei zno sa cs qs was provided through the characterization of the morphology and chemical composition of pei zno sa cs qs sem was employed to characterize the microstructure and structure of unmodified quartz sand zinc oxide coated quartz sand and pei zno sa cs qs sem micrographs revealed that the pei zno sa cs qs surface had a larger number of microparticles and nps with a rough structure fig 4 a f than the unmodified quartz sand to characterize the structure and the chemical composition of the coating more accurately the xps of pei zno sa cs coating was illustrated the three main peaks of xps spectra of pei zno sa cs coating were o1s c1s and n1s as shown in fig 5 a d fig 5 b indicates that o1s is a multi element spectra and the peaks centered at 531 05 ev 530 35 ev and 529 6 ev fitted to zn o c zn oh and zn o zn 41 which further suggests the successful grafting of zno nps onto the surface of hard quartz sand fig 5 c shows the c1s multi element spectra and the peaks concentrated at 286 9 ev 283 8 ev and 282 8 ev correspond to cc ch co and coo 40 the above multicomponent c1s spectra were derived from the complexation of zno and the cooh group in sa which is the crucial factor in the switching wettability of pei zno sa cs coating in ph response as shown in fig 5 e the eds element determination results are consistent with the xps spectra indicating that c o n and zn were uniformly coated on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs this condition shows that pei zno sa cs coating was grafted successfully on the surface of hard quartz sand through dip coating fig 5 f explores the functional group structure composition of pei zno sa cs coating the strong absorption peak at 3464 cm 1 was the stretching vibration peak of the oh group and the bending vibration peak at 1870 cm 1 was the bending vibration peak of the oh group which was primarily originated from the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups grafted on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs pei zno sa cs qs has more abundant chemical functional groups than the surface of unmodified quartz sand the strong absorption peaks at 2857 cm 1 and 2924 cm 1 were derived from the ch stretching vibration of ch3 and ch2 groups in sa of pei zno sa cs coating 42 the strong absorption peak at 471 cm 1 was the vibration absorption peak of zno which further indicates the successful coating of zno nps on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs the absorption peak at 1617 cm 1 was the co stretching vibration absorption peak in cooh 43 indicating that cooh group in sa was grafted onto the surface of zinc oxide coated pei zno sa cs qs successfully the absorption peaks at 1409 1549 cm 1 were derived from the cc stretching vibration in the benzene ring skeleton indicating that cs molecules with a benzene ring structure were grafted fig 5 g presents the xrd patterns of pei zno sa cs qs zno coated quartz sand and unmodified quartz sand pei zno sa cs qs and zno coated quartz sand and unmodified quartz sand had similar characteristic diffraction peaks such similarity indicates that zno nps were grafted on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs successfully and the surface structure of the original quartz sand filter material was retained in the surface modification process in addition the thermogravimetric analysis tga shows that the weight ratio of pei zno sa cs coating to pei zno sa cs qs was 17 21 wt fig 5 h demonstrating that pei zno sa cs qs has good thermal stability unmodified quartz sand has the characteristics of high temperature resistance and small thermal expansion coefficient so in the process of rising from low temperature to high temperature its quality was stable without obvious decline 3 3 stimuli responsive wettability transition stimuli responsive separation materials with reversible wettability transition have been the subject of increasing attention in recent years due to their novel wettability transition mechanism and excellent oil water separation performance when evaluating the wetting responsivity of pei zno sa cs qs pei zno sa cs qs was adhered to the glass slide and the static wca and the retention time of water on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs were measured after the water droplets with different ph values performed wetting as shown in fig 6 a the reversible wettability switch of pei zno sa cs qs can also be evaluated by measuring the uwoca of dichloromethane oil droplets under water to determine the uwoca and the retention time of dichloromethane dichloromethane oil droplets were dropped onto a quartz glass dish that contained water of different ph values for 30 s as shown in fig 6 b the ph range of the aqueous solution was 1 13 indicating strong acid to strong alkaline conditions this finding further verifies the acid and alkalinity resistance of pei zno sa cs qs when the ph was less than or equal to 7 wca was above 158 and uwoca was close to 0 demonstrating excellent hydrophobic and lipophilic effects as the ph increased the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs transformed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity when ph 11 wca was close to 0 and uwoca was above 151 which indicates that pei zno sa cs qs has good superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity wettability stability and alkali corrosion resistance in alkaline environments when ph 8 the wca of pei zno sa cs qs gradually increased as the ph increased uwoca tended to be stable and the hydrophilic rate of pei zno sa cs qs gradually increased when the ph was 13 the wca of pei zno sa cs qs decreased from 133 to 0 in 30 s fig 6 a demonstrating the sensitive wettability responsiveness of pei zno sa cs qs more advanced research progress has been achieved in this respect in comparison with the conversion time of wetting responsiveness of hard filter media reported in previous literature 29 44 45 the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs can be switched by water wetting at different ph and the switch is cyclic and reversible pei zno sa cs qs was placed on a slide and the ph value of the water was modified to 7 or 13 successively the cycle was repeated 10 times during which the wca changes of the water droplets on the surface of the filter material were recorded fig 6 c shows that the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs remains reversible between superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity after 10 cycles of wettability transformation demonstrating satisfactory reversible transitional wettability and wettability stability the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs can also be transformed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity after the material was treated with ammonia for 30 s pei zno sa cs qs was tiled in a quartz glass dish that contained ammonia and dichloromethane was dropped on this dish the uwoca of dichloromethane was higher than 159 the uwoca of organic reagents with different surface tensions was tested for the evaluation of the underwater superoleophobicity properties of ammonia treated pei zno sa cs qs fig 6 d suggests that the uwoca of different organic liquids on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs wetted by ammonia water was higher than 155 suggesting excellent underwater superoleophobicity after the pei zno sa cs qs infiltrated by ammonia water was heated at the temperature of 80 c for 15 min the ammonia molecules adsorbed on the coating surface would volatilize and spill over the coating as a result the hydrophilicity of the filter material surface would weaken and the surface of the material would become superhydrophobic superoleophilic again the wettability transformation of pei zno sa cs qs can be achieved by converting the ammonia and heating treatment the reversible transformation of surface wettability of pei zno sa cs qs in response to ph and ammonia stimuli is shown in fig 6 e the mechanism of the switchable wettability response of pei zno sa cs qs to ph and ammonia 46 48 is as follows 10 11 12 13 the condensation reaction between zno nps and sa yields zinc stearate coordination compounds 46 as indicated in formula 10 when solution ph changes it would lead to the chelation and cracking of zinc carboxylate as shown in formulas 10 11 showing two different states of protonation cooh and deprotonation coo simultaneously with the change in the molecular morphology and free energy of the surface coating the macroscopic expression was the change of surface wettability the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs was characterized by ph responsiveness after the material was treated with ammonia the coordination bonds of zinc carboxylate on pei zno sa cs qs were broken and a new ammonium carboxylate ligand formed 49 as shown in formulas 12 and 13 such changes caused the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs to convert from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity 49 according to owens and wendt 50 the surface tension was equivalent to the total contributions to the surface of the different intermolecular forces 51 therefore formula 9 can be rewritten as 14 γ l 1 cos θ 2 γ s d γ l d 2 γ s p γ l p where superscript d and p denote the dispersion force component and polar force component of the tension on the surface respectively according to formula 14 contact angle of water can be expressed as 15 cos θ w 2 γ s d γ w d 2 γ s p γ w p γ w 1 where θ w is the icas of water and γ w is the surface tension of water according to formula 12 ch3 ch2 16coonh4 was present in the ammonia treated pei zno sa cs coating nh4 in ch3 ch2 16coonh4 increased γ s p thereby increasing the polarity of the coating surface in turn causing the hydrophilicity of the coating to improve due to the introduction of nh4 the coating surface has a large γ s p and a relatively small γ s d such features meet the conditions for the existence of superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic surface therefore the surface wettability of pei zno sa cs qs was transformed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity the influence of ammonia treatment on wettability switching of pei zno sa cs qs was evaluated through contact angle analysis for pei zno sa cs qs after five rounds of ammonia treatment wettability cycling switching as shown in fig 6 f after treated with five cycles of ammonia the wca of pei zno sa cs qs was above 160 showing good wetting stability in addition to further investigate the effect of ammonia treatment on the structure and chemical composition of pei zno sa cs coating the pei zno sa cs coating before and after ammonia treatment was characterized by xps and ft ir fig 6 g shows that o1s c1s zn2p n1s and other main peaks of pei zno sa cs coating were detected before and after ammonia treatment next the n1s peak of xps of pei zno sa cs coating before and after ammonia treatment was compared and analyzed considering the effect of ammonia treatment on the chemical composition of the modified coating fig 6 h the n1s spectra of xps on the pei zno sa cs qs surface can be divided into two components the fitting peaks centered on 397 65 ev and 398 55 ev correspond to the nh in the pei molecule and the nh in the benzene ring group in the cs molecule respectively findings showed that pei and cs molecules were successfully grafted onto the surface of pei zno sa cs qs a new fitting peak of nh4 centered on 399 45 ev was added to the n1s spectra because of the complexation of nh3 and sa groups on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs after ammonia treatment as shown in fig 6 h the appearance of the nh4 fitting peak indicates that nh4 was in ch3 ch2 16coonh4 which verified the above wettability conversion principle in addition the infrared spectrum of wettability switching cycles for three times after ammonia treatment fig 6 i showed that the absorption peaks of υn h and δn h were present at 3001 cm 1 and 1455 cm 1 in the ammonia water infiltration of pei zno sa cs qs 46 this finding further indicated that nh3 penetrated the filter material coating and reacted which changed the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs 3 4 dye adsorption by pei zno sa cs qs the schiff base reaction 54 55 between cs and pei molecules fig 7 a further enhanced the adsorption of industrial dyes on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs the adsorption between acidic anionic dye congo red cr basic cationic dye methylene blue mb and pei zno sa cs qs will fluctuate noticeably affected by the ph value of the solution which is a variable factor that needs to be taken into account in the adsorption experiments figure s3 fig 7 b indicates the adsorption effect of pei zno sa cs qs on mb dye was enhanced as the solution ph increased and the dye separation efficiency was increased gradually for an alkaline solution the dye separation efficiency was flattened and the dye removal rate was 98 57 at a solution ph of 8 with the gradual increase in the solution ph the adsorption trend of the adsorption curve of cr dye differed from that of mb the separation efficiency of cr dye decreased gradually and then flattened at a solution ph of 14 the separation efficiency of cr dye was 98 57 at a ph less than 7 the surface of pei zno sa cs qs was protonated and the adsorption process was blocked by the electrostatic repulsion action between pei zno sa cs qs and the positively charged basic cationic dye mb meanwhile the dye separation efficiency decreased and the adsorption effect was worsened when the ph of the solution rose to the point of alkalinity the protons on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs were looted by oh in the solution and the surface of pei zno sa cs qs was in the state of deprotonation which enhanced the electronegativity on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs and the adsorption of mb on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs was enhanced gradually under the action of electrostatic attraction the adsorption effect of pei zno sa cs qs on the mb dye improved further along with the adsorption effect on the mb dye in an acidic state or at a low ph the acid anion cr dye and the protonated pei zno sa cs qs had a strong electrostatic attraction which further increased the adsorption of pei zno sa cs qs to the cr dye when the ph of the solution was 5 the removal rate of the cr dye was 99 43 the experimental results show that pei zno sa cs qs has a satisfactory removal effect on industrial dyes 3 5 stimuli responsive controllable oil water separation of pei zno sa cs qs this scheme uses the oil water separation device which can separate the water and oil phases of the mixture at the same time efficiently and continuously and has simplified traditional oil water separation process 52 53 simultaneous oil water separation was performed for the mixture of oil and water fig 8 a fig 8 b shows that when the particle size of pei zno sa cs qs is 0 3 0 6 mm the water separation efficiency was greater than 99 23 the water flux reached 6935 200 l m 2 h 1 and the oil separation efficiency was greater than 99 13 affected by the oil viscosity and surface tension the oil flux ranged from 2641 89 to 8143 26 l m 2 h 1 and the oil flux varied considerably as the oil viscosity changed compared with the traditional vertical separation device the oil water separation device was less affected by gravity and more affected by oil viscosity 2 the influence of cyclic wettability change of pei zno sa cs qs on oil water separation was then evaluated for this purpose water removing type pei zno sa cs qs and oil removing type pei zno sa cs qs with cyclic wettability change were filled at both ends of the type device for simultaneous oil water separation of the dichlorethane water mixture pei zno sa cs qs achieved a higher than 98 89 oil water separation efficiency after 10 cycles of wettability conversion and the oil water separation flux did not decrease significantly fig 8 c this phenomenon shows that pei zno sa cs qs has good switchable wettability and wettability stability thus providing a new reference direction for the constant and efficient oil water separation of the quartz sand filter material 3 6 self cleaning and wetting stability of pei zno sa cs qs surface the wca and uwoca and water resistance and oil resistant hydrostatic strength of pei zno sa cs qs were measured for further evaluation of the oil water separation performance of pei zno sa cs qs the surface of pei zno sa cs qs shows superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity in acidic and neutral environments thus the surface can resist wetting by industrial dye wastewater the uwoca of pei zno sa cs qs was higher than 155 after undergoing pre wetting with oil the maximum water support height of pei zno sa cs qs after n hexane wetting was 21 8 cm formula 4 indicates that the intrusion pressure of the filter material was about 2 14 kpa suggesting good water retention ability and hydrophobic performance which is shown in fig 9 a in alkaline environments the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs surface changed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity therefore the surface can stand up to wetting of different oils the contact angles of n hexane petroleum ether liquid paraffin hexadecane diesel dichloroethane and trichloromethane were greater than 153 fig 9 b n hexane had a maximum support height of approximately 18 5 cm after the filter material was wetted by ammonia water and the corresponding intrusion pressure was about 1 813 kpa this finding suggests that pei zno sa cs qs has improved pollution resistance and good self cleaning performance in the oil water separation link the above results suggest that pei zno sa cs qs has good ph response wettability conversion and self cleaning anti pollution performance the mechanical durability and anti corrosion ability of pei zno sa cs qs were explored to evaluate the wetting stability of pei zno sa cs qs as shown in fig 9 c after pei zno sa cs qs was ultrasonically oscillated for 48 h and then wetted with acidic water and ammonia water wca on the surface of pei zno sa cs qs was around 158 and uwoca was higher than 158 compared with pei zno sa cs qs without ultrasonic treatment the wca and uwoca on the surface of the filter material decreased within the range of 2 with a relatively slow overall trend of change exhibiting good mechanical durability to evaluate the anti corrosion ability of pei zno sa cs qs pei zno sa cs qs was immersed in sdbs and nacl solution with a certain concentration gradient for 12 h afterward it was dried in an oven at 80 c for 9 h and it was wetted with ammonia and acid water respectively the wca on the surface of the filter material was higher than 158 and uwoca was within 159 161 after treatment the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs remained in the range that corresponds to superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity and superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity these experimental results show that pei zno sa cs coating can exist stably in a surfactant rich solution showing good wetting stability and that it can separate surfactant stabilized oil water mixture 3 7 separation of oil water emulsions by pei zno sa cs qs pei zno sa cs qs can reversibly convert superhydrophobic superoleophilic surfaces into superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic surfaces within 10 s thus oil in water emulsions and water in oil emulsions were demulsified through the switchable surface wettability toward water and oil liu et al 56 stated that the pore size of the modified filter material greatly affected the separation of oil water emulsions different particle sizes of pei zno sa cs qs were used to filter and separate diesel in water emulsion for verification of the influence of particle size of pei zno sa cs qs on the separation efficiency of oil water emulsion fig 10 reflects that the separation efficiency of diesel in water emulsion decrease gradually with the increase of pei zno sa cs qs particle size the separation efficiency is up to 99 17 when the particle size is 0 7 0 125 mm therefore pei zno sa cs qs with a particle size range of 0 7 0 125 mm was selected to separate oil water emulsions the oil water emulsions was observed before and after separation by using an optical microscope to examine the demulsification effect of pei zno sa cs qs on oil water emulsions the oil water emulsions was turbid before separation and it became clear and transparent after filtration microscopic images show that dense emulsion droplets were present in the emulsions before filtration these droplets disappeared after filtration figs 11 a e and 12 a e findings show that 0 7 0 125 mm pei zno sa cs qs has a positive demulsification and separation effect on oil water emulsions figure s4 showed the demulsification mechanism of oil in water emulsions when the oily wastewater after emulsification was poured into the filter column the continuous water phase passed through the filter layer affected by the gravity and capillary pressure θa water 90 δpwater 0 and the oil beads were intercepted by the pore of the filter bed because of the superoleophobic effect of filter media surface on oil θa oil 90 δpoil 0 with the filtration going on the oily wastewater volume decreased and the oil concentration increased constantly when the subsequent oil droplets contacted with the intercepted oil droplets the coalescence effect caused the size of oil droplets gradually increased when the oil beads on the filter column surface coalesced gradually and increased a continuous oil phase was formed the above separation performance confirmed that the pei zno sa cs qs can separate the micro nanosized oil droplets from water effectively moreover the demulsification process of surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsion was achieved by pei zno sa cs qs which was treated by the transition of ph responsive wettability the above experimental results show that pei zno sa cs qs showed excellent demulsification effect on surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsion and the demulsification mechanism of water in oil emulsion is quite close to that of oil in water emulsion the demulsification mechanism for water in oil emulsion is shown in figure s5 to characterize the separation ability of pei zno sa cs qs in a profound way dynamic light scattering dls tests were conducted on the five emulsions before and after separation the particle size distribution of five water in oil emulsions before and after filtration by pei zno sa cs qs is presented in fig 11 f k the particle size of the emulsion was between 300 and 1400 nm and that of the filtrate was between 1 and 4 nm prior to filtration in general pei zno sa cs qs has a good separation effect on water in oil emulsion as indicated by the experiment results the wettability of pei zno sa cs qs was transformed into superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity after the material was infiltrated by ammonia water which can possibly result in the demulsification of surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsion the particle size distribution of five oil in water emulsions before and after filtration by pei zno sa cs qs is shown in fig 12 f k before filtration the particle size of the emulsion ranged from 300 nm to 1400 nm and the filtrate size ranged from 1 nm to 5 nm thereby indicating a positive demulsification separation effect in summary pei zno sa cs qs has a perfect separation effect on oil in water emulsion the separation flux and separation efficiency of oil in water and water in oil emulsion were analyzed numerically for further evaluation of the separation effect of pei zno sa cs qs on oil water emulsion as suggested in fig 11 k the separation efficiency of pei zno sa cs qs for water in oil emulsion is larger than 98 and the separation flux ranged from 997 25 to 1423 406 l m 2 h 1 the separation efficiency of pei zno sa cs qs for oil in water emulsion was higher than 98 79 and the separation flux ranged from 1228 9 to 1443 8 l m 2 h 1 fig 12 k the physicochemical properties of oil products had a large effect on the flux of water in oil emulsion in general a high viscosity oil corresponds to a low separation flux yet the flux is still higher than that reported in other published studies 29 32 41 in conclusion pei zno sa cs qs has high separation efficiency and separation flux for on demand oil water emulsion separation which can provide a new reference direction for the separation of oil water emulsion by using rigid filter materials 4 conclusion pei zno sa cs qs with switchable wettability properties was synthesized through the use of a simple dip coating method the ph responsive pei zno sa cs qs can be transformed from superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity to superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity when the modified material was treated with ammonia and it can regain its superhydrophobicity superoleophilicity after heating treatment pei zno sa cs qs has good self cleaning and wetting stability and it can achieve oil water separation efficiency of about 98 89 after 10 wettability cycles of transition in addition pei zno sa cs qs has high separation efficiency and stable adsorption effect on mb and cr dyes it is a filter material with two functions namely continuous separation of oil water and dye adsorption because of the rich functional unity on the pei zno sa cs qs surface and ph switchable wettability simultaneous and continuous oil water mixture separation can be realized with a good separation effect on surfactant stabilized oil in water and water in oil emulsion in summary pei zno sa cs qs has stellar oil water separation and dye adsorption performance and it can provide a new directional reference for developing hard filter media the developed material has a strong development potential and application value in oil bearing wastewater treatment and industrial dye adsorption declaration of

13163,this study explored the potential of caffeine being utilized as the fuel for the microbes to produce electrons for electricity generation in up flow constructed wetland microbial fuel cell ufcw mfc the effect of caffeine concentration was investigated to identify the availability of ufcw mfc in the conversion of caffeine to electrons for electricity production and the effect of operating conditions circuit connection supplementary aeration and plant was studied to determine their significance in the treatment of caffeine containing wastewater the ufcw mfc achieved about 98 of decaffeination efficiency regardless of caffeine concentration while a decrease of efficiency was observed when ufcw mfc operated without supplementary aeration and plant 93 cod removal efficiency decreased correspondingly to the increase of caffeine concentration which could be contributed by the higher concentration of caffeine and its intermediates the degradation pathway of caffeine in ufcw mfc was explored in this study it was remarkable that ammonia was produced and converted to ammonium ions during caffeine catabolism supplementary aeration and macrophyte play a crucial role in removing excess caffeine intermediates as well as accumulated ammonium ions the toxicity assessment revealed that caffeine was degraded to less toxic products the closed circuit connection not only contributed to electricity generation but also enhanced the caffeine and cod removal efficiency by 4 6 and 5 4 in the anaerobic region respectively the increase of voltage and maximum power density from phase i to phase iv indicated that caffeine could be converted to electrons by the anaerobes for electricity production graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords caffeine constructed wetland microbial fuel cell degradation pathway electricity generation toxicity assessment 1 introduction in recent years the removal of emerging organic micropollutants has gained interest in the field of wastewater treatment these anthropogenic compounds consist of industrial chemicals personal care pharmaceutical product and their respective intermediate products 1 even though most of these compounds were only traceable in extremely low concentrations in the aquatic environment chronic exposure to these compounds might lead to numerous adverse effects on the ecosystem and living organisms 2 therefore the development of effective methods for the treatment of wastewater containing these emerging micropollutants has drawn the attention of researchers caffeine 1 3 7 trimethylxanthine is a purine alkaloid that occurs naturally in many plant species including coffee seeds tea leaves citrus fruits and cocoa bean seeds 3 besides caffeine is also widely used as a stimulant or adjuvant in the pharmaceutical industry 4 caffeine has been consistently detected in the surface waters due to the continuous discharge of wastewater from industries hospitals and households the caffeine concentration in the aquatic environment is wide ranging ng mg l with relatively high values in wastewater and surface water 5 in the study of chen et al 6 the wastewater made of coffee and milk processing wastewater consists of 470 100 mg l caffeine concentration the high value of caffeine should be treated before releasing to the surface water caffeine is known to be persistent in the water environment because of its high solubility and negligible volatility the persistence of caffeine could lead to a major environmental concern due to its adverse effects on the environment such as aquatic toxicity antibiotic resistant bacteria development genotoxicity and hormonal disturbances 7 several physical and chemical treatment techniques on caffeine removal have been previously studied such as adsorption advanced oxidative processes and membrane separation 8 however these methods are low cost effective and could contribute to secondary pollutants which require additional treatments to further remove the secondary pollutants alternatively bioremediation techniques are environmentally friendly ecologically comprehensive and sustainable reclamation strategies 9 microorganisms and plants can remove organic contaminants through bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation process thus further research on bioremediation techniques should be carried out to enhance the removal of caffeine from the aquatic environment hybrid system of constructed wetland and microbial fuel cell cw mfc is an emerging treatment system that is used to treat wastewater and produce electricity simultaneously 10 11 in an up flow cw mfc ufcw mfc a significant dissolved oxygen concentration gradient is established vertically where the aerobic region is developed at the upper bed and the anaerobic region is developed at the lower bed of the bioreactor cw mfc is capable of converting the organic matter in the wastewater to electricity through microbial activity the electrogenic bacteria that exist in the anode utilize the substrates as the fuel source for metabolic activities and produce electrons at the same time the anode is then served as the terminal electron acceptor and transfers the electrons to the cathode which served as the electron acceptor via an external circuit to generate electricity 12 cw mfc has shown its potential in treating various types of wastewater such as swine slurry removal 13 dye decolourization 14 and antibiotic degradation 15 caffeine containing wastewater treatment has been previously studied using cw 16 and mfc 17 however there is still a lack of study on the treatment of caffeine containing wastewater in the hybrid system in addition the process of caffeine degradation has been mostly reported in the aerobic environment while there are limited studies on the anaerobic degradation of caffeine therefore this study aimed to explore the potential of converting caffeine containing wastewater to electricity using ufcw mfc with various concentrations of caffeine the removal of caffeine was more focused on the anodic region since it was crucial to determine whether caffeine could be used as the substrate for the anaerobes to produce electrons which is needed for electricity generation moreover the treatment performance of caffeine containing wastewater was investigated under different operating conditions circuit connection aeration and macrophyte the results were analyzed with the statistical analysis analysis of variance and tukey kramer test to determine the significance of caffeine concentration on the performance of ufcw mfc as well as the significance of operating conditions on the caffeine containing wastewater treatment efficiency the toxicity of untreated and treated caffeine containing wastewater was also investigated in this study for the evaluation of the efficiency of ufcw mfc in treating caffeine containing wastewater the degradation pathway of caffeine in ufcw mfc was also proposed based on the results from the gas chromatography mass spectrum gc ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 ufcw mfc setup and operation the bioreactor was built up with an acrylic column with a height of 75 cm and a diameter of 17 5 cm as previously described in teoh et al 18 the bioreactor was established outdoor with a temperature of 28 3 c to develop an even flow of

effect of electrode spacing on electricity generation the bioreactor was embedded with three layers of the anode at the lower region 8 cm 23 cm and 38 cm from the bottom of the wetland bed on the other hand the cathode was developed at the upper region of the bioreactor 53 cm from the bottom of the bioreactor the volume of the electrodes was 2405 59 cm3 the activated carbon and gravel were inoculated with mixed culture sludge obtained from the wastewater treatment plant of shorubber m sdn bhd a glove manufacturing company resistor 1000 ω carbon rods stainless steel and copper wires were used for the connection of anode and cathode the voltage output of ufcw mfc was recorded via a data logger midi logger gl820 graphtec water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes acquired from tasik melati perlis was used as the macrophyte and the optional supplementary aeration was provided by placing air sparger below the cathode the ufcw mfc was operated for seven stages to explore the influence of the caffeine concentration circuit connection aeration and plant on wastewater treatment and energy production performance at phase i the ufcw mfc was operated as the control with 0 mg l of caffeine 50 100 and 300 mg l of caffeine were added to the synthetic wastewater at phases ii iii and iv respectively to assess the influence of caffeine concentration on the performance of ufcw mfc open circuit mode was carried out at phase v to evaluate the influence of circuit connection on caffeine containing wastewater treatment performance the supplementary aeration and plant were removed at phases vi and vii respectively for the study of the effect of aeration and plant on the treatment of caffeine containing wastewater the operation sequence was summarised in table 1 the composition of synthetic wastewater was 409 8 mg l ch3coona 176 1 mg l nh4no3 3 4 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 7 0 mg l nacl 36 7 mg l k2hpo4 and 4 0 mg l cacl2 2h2o a peristaltic pump huiyu bt100j 1a china was used for the continuous feeding of the synthetic wastewater with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 day 2 2 analysis the caffeine containing wastewater treatment performance along the ufcw mfc bioreactor was evaluated by collecting the wastewater from influent and all sampling points the samples collected were analyzed for caffeine chemical oxidation demand cod nitrate ion no3 ammonium ion nh4 dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp caffeine concentration was measured using an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer from mesu lab instruments me uv1300 at λmax 284 nm before conducting the cod analysis the liquid samples were centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 10 min with a centrifuge cence l500 china and analyzed using hach dr 2800 colorimeter the no3 concentration was

determined by varying the external resistance between 20 000 to 50 ω to characterize the electrochemical behavior and performance of the ufcw mfc the power density curve was calculated from the polarization curves and the maximum power density and the corresponding internal resistance were identified from the power density curve the intermediates and the by products of the degraded caffeine were identified using gc ms gc 2010 plus shimadzu japan equipped with a bpx 5 capillary column 30 m length 0 25 mm inner diameter 0 25 μm thickness liquid liquid extraction was performed by extracting 300 ml of samples with 10 ml of dichloromethane before the gc ms analysis 19 the mass spectra obtained from the gc ms were used for the identification of the intermediates and by products of degraded

difference between the caffeine concentration and operating conditions while p value 0 05 indicates that there is a significant difference between the caffeine concentration and operating conditions the tukey kramer method was further conducted as the post hoc test if anova shows p value 0 05 to determine the significant differences between the specific caffeine concentration and operating

system was evaluated in this study the wastewater treatment performance of ufcw mfc was outlined in table 2 fig 2 shows the decaffeination efficiency of synthetic wastewater along the ufcw mfc bioreactor around 98 of total decaffeination efficiency was able to be achieved in this study the removal efficiency of caffeine in this study was comparable to the previous study of oliveira et al 16 and yap et al 17 which used vertical flow constructed wetland and doubled chambered microbial fuel cell for the degradation of caffeine respectively a 94 of caffeine removal was observed from the study of oliveira et al 16 with e crassipes as the macrophyte and a 97 of decaffeination efficiency was achieved in yap et al 17 with caffeine being treated in the cathode chamber this study demonstrates the capability of decaffeination in the hybrid system of cw and mfc was comparable and might enhance the degradation of caffeine compared with cw and mfc alone while converting it to electricity simultaneously biodegradation was the main process in removing caffeine from synthetic wastewater 21 in the ufcw mfc system the anaerobic and aerobic process was involved in caffeine removal though the removal of caffeine was well known to occur in the aerobic environment there are still limited studies on decaffeination in the anaerobic environment previous studies have shown the potential of treating caffeine containing wastewater using an anaerobic process chen et al 6 has successfully degraded the caffeine using the methanogenesis process in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor the study achieved an 87 5 of caffeine removal efficiency and converted the caffeine to methane gas by applying a similar concept to ufcw mfc caffeine can be degraded by the anaerobes and produced electrons for electricity generation as shown in fig 2 the decaffeination process was mainly occurred in the anaerobic region s1 s3 which achieved 80 92 of total removal efficiency caffeine consists of carbon and nitrogen in its heterocyclic structure which can be utilized as the fuel for the microbes to sustain their activity and growth 3 as a result caffeine was degraded by the anaerobes and significantly removed in the anaerobic region the residual caffeine was further degraded in the aerobic region where supplementary aeration and plant were placed the effect of caffeine concentration on decaffeination performance was investigated by preparing 50 100 and 300 mg l of caffeine as the influent to study the removal performance along the bioreactor as shown in table 2 the total decaffeination efficiency of 50 100 and 300 mg l of caffeine was 97 3 98 5 and 98 3 respectively the results indicated that the ufcw mfc system exhibits the capability of removing various concentrations of caffeine at a high removal efficiency in this study caffeine was mainly degraded at the anodic region which contributed to 91 5 86 3 and 79 7 as the caffeine concentration increased from 50 to 300 mg l respectively this indicated that ufcw mfc possesses the potential of degrading caffeine through anaerobic microbial degradation and converting them to electrons as the concentration increased from 50 to 100 and 300 mg l the decaffeination efficiency in the anaerobic region decreased correspondingly to the increase of caffeine the most significant difference in decaffeination efficiency can be observed at sampling point s1 where the decaffeination efficiency decreased from 84 0 to 81 2 followed by declining to 57 8 corresponding to the increase of caffeine concentration from 50 to 100 and 300 mg l despite the removal efficiency decreased along with the increase of caffeine concentration the amount of caffeine treated inclined with the increase of caffeine concentration which contributed 42 63 82 26 and 173 15 mg l of caffeine removal at s1 for phases ii iii and iv respectively anova was used to analyze the significant difference among the various caffeine concentration tukey kramer test was also performed as a post hoc test to further analyze the significance of the caffeine concentration in the anaerobic degradation the statistical analysis shows that there was a significant increase of caffeine concentration treated when the caffeine increased from 50 to 100 and 300 mg l where the p value is less than 0 05 at sampling point s1 the significant increment of treated caffeine could lead to the increase of electrons produced as the microbes tend to consume more carbon sources to sustain their metabolism rate when the carbon source increased 22 as a result more electrons could be accepted by the anode and transferred to the cathode for electricity generation oon et al 23 also demonstrated that more organic matter was degraded when the carbon sources were doubled which contributed to the production of more electrons on the other hand the residual caffeine concentration at the end of the anodic region s3 was 4 31 13 82 and 60 71 mg l for phases ii iii and iv respectively the statistical analysis reveals that there was no significant difference when caffeine concentration increased from 50 to 100 mg l p 0 05 while there was a significant difference when the concentration of caffeine increased from 100 to 300 mg l p 0 05 at s3 this indicates that caffeine was degraded to a very low concentration at the end of anaerobic treatment for the lower concentration of caffeine whereas for 300 mg l of initial caffeine there was still a lot of caffeine that remained untreated before entering the aerobic region the high amount of remaining caffeine entering the cathodic region could consume the oxygen in the cathodic region and consequently reduced the oxygen available for the electricity generation to further support the findings the untreated caffeine from s3 was reduced by 2 74 12 21 and 55 44 mg l for phases ii iii and iv respectively in the aerobic region as a result more oxygen was consumed for the degradation of caffeine instead of utilized as the electrons acceptor for the generation of electricity do concentration slightly decreased from 4 52 6 26 mg l to 4 32 5 81 mg l in the aerobic region when caffeine concentration increased to 300 mg l similar findings were found in the study of villaseñor et al 24 where the organic matter was not completely oxidized in the anodic region and consumed the dissolved oxygen in the upper zone due to the higher oxygen demand the higher consumption of oxygen in the cathodic region could slightly hinder the increment of electricity production despite the increment of caffeine concentration which will be further discussed in section 3 3 in a short conclusion the results demonstrated the capability of removing various concentrations of caffeine in the anaerobic environment and the potential of converting caffeine to produce electricity in the ufcw mfc system the influence of operating conditions circuit connection aeration and plant on the total decaffeination performance was explored to investigate the treatment mechanism of caffeine in the ufcw mfc system anova and tukey kramer test were performed to analyze the significance of the operating conditions the total decaffeination efficiency was 98 3 98 5 93 0 and 92 4 for phases iv v vi and vii respectively as outlined in table 2 according to anova there is a significant difference p 0 05 among the operating parameters tukey post hoc test was then conducted by pairing the operating parameters phases iv v iv vi iv vii v vi v vii vi vii the main pairs used for the analysis of the operating conditions were iv v circuit connection v vi aeration and vi vii plant the results show that there was no statistically significant difference between the pairings of iv v and vi vii p 0 05 while v vi pairing shows a significant difference p 0 05 this indicates that the influence of circuit connection and the presence of macrophytes on the total decaffeination in the ufcw mfc system was not significant while aeration plays an important role in the complete degradation of caffeine aerobic condition is more favorable for caffeine catabolism as it increases the degradation rate of caffeine compared to anaerobic conditions 25 the effect of circuit connection on the total caffeine removal was not significant due to the strong effect of aeration at the aerobic region for the effect of macrophytes previous studies have demonstrated that plants could enhance the removal of caffeine through the uptake from the roots 1 in this study the insignificant improvement of caffeine degradation performance by the plant may be due to the low hrt 1 day oliveira et al 16 reported that e crassipes could remove 41 7 of 27 mg l of caffeine with an hrt of 7 days hence the effect of the plant on decaffeination is expected to be more significant with a higher hrt the effect of operating conditions on decaffeination was also evaluated at the anaerobic region as well since it is crucial for the conversion of caffeine to electricity similarly anova and tukey post hoc tests were conducted for the evaluation phase iv performed 4 6 better than phase v and around 10 better than phase vi and vii from the statistical perspective anova demonstrates that the effect of operating conditions on decaffeination in the anaerobic region is significant p 0 05 tukey test identified that iv v and v vi pairings show a statistically significant difference p 0 05 whereas vi vii pairing was not different significantly p 0 05 the results indicated that the presence of the anode and external circuit closed circuit not only can be used as the path for electricity generation but also could improve the degradation of caffeine the closed circuit connection allowed the electrons to transfer from anode to cathode and could promote the growth of electrogenic bacteria 26 consequently the transfer of electrons and the growth of microbes facilitated the degradation rate of caffeine in the anodic region and thus lead to a better removal efficiency of caffeine the integration of the mfc feature to cw shows the improvement of caffeine degradation and better treatment performance than the cw alone especially in the anaerobic region the significant difference between v vi pairing in this study was mainly due to the partial diffusion of oxygen from sampling point s4 to s3 where supplementary aeration was provided during phase v as shown in fig s1 the dissolved oxygen of phase v was slightly higher compared to phase vi at s3 the slight aerobic condition was contributed to a better removal at s3 in phase v compared to phase vi in summary ufcw mfc operated in the closed circuit could enhance the decaffeination process in the anaerobic region while supplementary aeration is needed to further degrade the residual caffeine the presence of macrophytes does not significantly improve the removal of caffeine in this study but the effect of the plant is expected to be more significant when operated at a higher hrt the significance of the operating conditions on decaffeination in the ufcw mfc system was ranked in order of supplementary aeration circuit connection plant 3 1 2 toxicity assessment to assess the impact of caffeine on living organisms and the effectiveness of the ufcw mfc system on removing the toxicity of caffeine a phytotoxicity assessment was conducted the assessment was carried out by using lettuce seeds as the bioindicators to identify the toxicity level of caffeine through the comparison of radicle length as shown in fig 3 synthetic wastewater containing 50 mg l of caffeine could contribute to a 55 6 of toxicity level the toxicity level was increased by 11 5 to 67 1 and further increased by 26 9 to 94 when the caffeine concentration increased from 50 to 100 mg l and 100 to 300 mg l respectively the results indicate that caffeine with a concentration of 50 and 100 mg l could moderately inhibit the growth of lettuce seeds whereas 300 mg l of caffeine could seriously hinder the growth due to its toxicity it was notable that the toxicity level of the synthetic wastewater was decreased significantly after the treatment ufcw mfc system has shown its effectiveness on decaffeination by reducing 19 9 24 7 and 50 9 of toxicity levels for phases ii iii and iv respectively the reduction of toxicity indicated that the intermediate product of caffeine is less toxic compared to its parental product tarka and cornish 27 also reported that caffeine was more toxic compared to its intermediates of theobromine and theophylline the operating conditions of the ufcw mfc bioreactor did not significantly affect the toxic removal in this study as most of the caffeine was removed at the end of the treatment 3 1 3 degradation pathway the catabolic pathway of caffeine in the ufcw mfc system was proposed based on the results of the gc ms analysis fig 4 depicts the proposed degradation pathway of caffeine in the ufcw mfc bioreactor gummadi et al 3 reported that caffeine is catabolized via two major pathways which are demethylation and oxidation in the ufcw mfc system the synthetic wastewater was first treated anaerobically followed by aerobic degradation hence caffeine was expected to undergo three demethylation processes to form theobromine paraxanthine which further converts to 7 methylxanthine and finally to xanthine the methyl groups that split off during the demethylation process were generally hydrolyzed to methanol which was then converted to carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o the intermediate product xanthine was then oxidized to uric acid and further degraded to allantoin 28 allantoin was presumed to undergo the hydrolysis process to form allantoic acid and further hydrolyzed to form ureidoglycine and produced co2 and ammonia nh3 ureidoglycine could subsequently be hydrolyzed to ureidoglycolic acid and nh3 ureidoglycolic acid could be further degraded to oxaluric acid urea and glyoxylic acid which was generally degraded to oxalic acid co2 h2o and nh3 3 2 cod ammonium and nitrate ion removal 3 2 1 effect of caffeine concentration the average influent cod concentration of synthetic wastewater phase i was 314 mg l as shown in table 2 the cod concentration increased when the caffeine was added which contribute to a total cod of 369 428 and 647 mg l for phases ii iii and iv respectively the increase of cod concentration indicates that caffeine possesses the potential of being used as the substrate for microbial activity fig 5 a demonstrates the cod removal in the ufcw mfc bioreactor a 99 6 98 1 96 0 and 91 7 of total cod removal efficiency was achieved for phases i ii iii and iv respectively in this study statistical analysis was carried out via anova and tukey test to assess the influence of caffeine concentration on the cod removal performance in the ufcw mfc system the analysis results reveal that caffeine concentration significantly affects the total removal of cod in the ufcw mfc p 0 05 this could be possibly due to the intermediates produced during the degradation of caffeine according to indermuhle et al 29 which study the degradation of caffeine using conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation reported that the removal rate of caffeine faster than the total organic carbon indicated the formation of the intermediates could increase the carbon concentration similarly most of the caffeine 98 was removed at the end of treatment in this study as shown in fig 2 hence it was presumed that the unconsumed intermediate products of caffeine were responsible for the residual cod in the effluent as the concentration of caffeine increased the formation of intermediate products also increased which consequently decreased the total cod removal efficiency the removal of cod mainly occurred in the anaerobic region as shown in fig 5 a where a sharp increment of cod removal efficiency from influent to s1 followed by a steady increment from s1 to s3 was observed the anaerobic process contributed 98 7 96 6 92 8 and 80 3 of cod removal efficiency for phases i ii iii and iv respectively the organic matter in the wastewater was utilized as the fuel for microbial metabolism and growth which could lead to high cod removal efficiency in the anaerobic region 30 fig 5 a depicts that there was a decrement in cod removal efficiency corresponding to the increment of caffeine concentration based on the control phase i sodium acetate was the main contributor to the cod and it was almost completely degraded in the anaerobic region therefore the decrement was mainly due to the residual caffeine and its intermediate products anova and tukey test show that the residual cod in the anaerobic region was not significant when 50 and 100 mg l of caffeine was introduced to the synthetic wastewater p 0 05 whereas for 300 mg l of caffeine the residual cod concentration was significantly higher in the anaerobic region compared to the others p 0 05 the results suggest that most of the caffeine and its intermediate products were degraded in the anaerobic region for phases ii and iii while there was a portion of caffeine and intermediates remained untreated at the end of anaerobic treatment for phase iv the trend of cod removal was similar to the decaffeination where the removal of cod concentration increased despite the decrement in the removal efficiency as the caffeine concentration increased from 0 to 300 mg l a total of 310 356 397 and 520 mg l of cod was removed in the anaerobic region s1 s3 for phases i ii iii and iv respectively according to anova and tukey test the increase of cod treated corresponding to the increase of initial caffeine concentration was statistically significant p 0 05 the significant increment of cod removal could be contributed by the degradation of caffeine and its intermediates via the microbial activities when the caffeine was added to the synthetic wastewater at phase ii and increased to 100 and 300 mg l at phases iii and iv respectively the results suggest that the anaerobes were capable of oxidizing the organic matter including sodium acetate caffeine and the intermediates at a high efficiency for phases ii and iii in the anodic region as the microorganisms tend to consume more carbon sources when available 31 while the concentration of organic matter was a bit high for the microbes to completely consumed for phase iv in the anaerobic region which could be due to the high concentration of caffeine as well as the intermediates produced during the decaffeination process the unutilized organic substrates were further degraded in the aerobic region s4 and s5 by the aerobes where the supplementary aeration and plant were provided to the bioreactor 32 ammonia is known to be capable of causing adverse effects to the aquatic environment when released at significant levels in an aqueous solution ammonia could convert to ammonium ions nh4 when ph is low 33 the equilibrium equation was shown in eq 8 8 nh 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h in the ufcw mfc system nitrification is the main route for the removal of ammonium ions the nitrification process is favorable to occur in the aerobic environment where the oxidation is carried out in two steps by two different bacteria groups the ammonium ions were first oxidized by the nitrosomonas to nitrite no2 while nitrobacter further oxidized nitrite to nitrate no3 34 the nitrification process was shown as follow 9 nh 4 3 2 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o 10 no 2 1 2 o 2 no 3 the effect of caffeine concentration on ammonium ion removal was assessed in this study as shown in fig 5 b the total nitrification efficiency was 97 3 96 1 96 0 and 88 7 for phases i ii iii and iv respectively anova and tukey test suggest that the effect of caffeine concentration was only significant when the concentration increase to 300 mg l p 0 05 a more significant difference was observed in the anaerobic region where the ammonium removal efficiency of 300 mg l of caffeine shows a decrement of 16 from sampling point s2 to s3 it was notable that the trend of ammonium removal in phase iv was different from the previous study of teoh et al 18 where the synthetic wastewater used was free of caffeine the ammonium ions removal in teoh et al 18 was similar to phase i where the ammonium ions slightly decreased and remained almost constant in the anaerobic region s1 s3 while there was a significant increment of ammonium concentration from s2 to s3 in this study for phase iv the significant difference in the trend between the synthetic wastewater with and without caffeine suggests that caffeine was the main factor that contributed to this difference as mentioned in the caffeine degradation pathway section section 3 1 3 nh3 was produced in the process of caffeine degradation the nh3 produced tends to be converted to ammonium ions due to the slightly low ph 6 80 which could lead to the increase of ammonium ions concentration 35 thus the decrement of ammonium removal efficiency from s2 to s3 was mainly induced by the accumulated nh3 produced during the degradation of caffeine moreover unionized ammonia can cause toxicity to nitrosomonas and nitrobacter bacteria and inhibit the nitrification process 36 as a result the nitrification efficiency decreased with the increase of caffeine concentration anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox was also another alternative pathway for the removal of ammonium anammox occurred under an anaerobic environment where the ammonium was oxidized to n2 by autotrophic anammox bacteria 37 as shown in fig 5 b a small portion of ammonium 10 24 was removed in the anaerobic region which could be contributed by the anammox process oon et al 38 reported a similar finding where anammox contributed 12 of ammonium removal in the anaerobic region nitrate possesses toxicity that could cause harmful effects on the aquatic animal the nitrate toxicity was attributed to the nitrate ions as the nitrate ion does not form an unionized species in the aquatic environment 36 nitrate was mainly removed through the denitrification process in ufcw mfc the denitrification process occurred in the lower part of the bioreactor which was in an anaerobic environment the denitrification process involved the activity of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as pseudomonas micrococcus bacillus and achromobacter nitrate could be used as the terminal electron acceptor by the facultative anaerobic bacteria and converted to nitrite and ultimately to nitrogen no3 no2 n2 39 fig 5 c demonstrates the effect of caffeine concentration on nitrate removal performance in the ufcw mfc bioreactor the total denitrification efficiency was relatively low which only contributed 40 7 39 3 37 3 and 25 8 of nitrate removal for phases i ii iii and iv respectively the low nitrate removal efficiency was mainly attributed to the nitrification process which converted nh4 to no3 at the end of the treatment the low denitrification efficiency was consistent with previous studies where the conversion of ammonium ions to nitrate ions during the nitrification process at the upper part of the wetland bed greatly increased the nitrate concentration at the effluent 30 38 the denitrification efficiency of oon et al 30 and oon et al 38 was 40 and 50 respectively the results were comparable with phase i as the initial concentration of ammonium and nitrate was similar to this study the removal efficiency of nitrate shows decrement corresponding to the increment of the caffeine concentration added to the synthetic wastewater the effect of caffeine concentration on the total denitrification performance was significantly observed in phase iv based on the results of anova and tukey test p 0 05 the results were consistent with the nitrification process where the increment of the ammonium ions removal induced the increase of nitrate ions produced as a result the denitrification efficiency decreased with the increase of caffeine concentration in addition it was remarkable that the denitrification efficiency in the anaerobic region s1 s3 was almost the same which achieved approximately 92 despite the caffeine concentration for all phases this suggests that the nitrate removal was not directly affected by the degradation of caffeine but was affected by the nitrification of ammonia and ammonium ions produced during caffeine catabolism 3 2 2 effect of operating conditions the effect of operating conditions on cod removal performance was also investigated in this study according to the statistical analysis circuit connection phase iv v pairing shows no significant effect on the total cod removal efficiency p 0 05 which recorded 91 7 and 89 4 for closed and open circuits respectively however the closed circuit was significantly performed better in the anaerobic region p 0 05 the results were correlated to caffeine degradation this indicates that the significant difference in cod removal performance in the anaerobic region between closed and open circuits was mainly induced by the unutilized caffeine and its intermediate products the connection between anode and cathode was known to have the ability to enhance the degradation of organic matter through the transfer of electrons and the promotion of the growth of microbes 40 41 the presence of an anode could act as the terminal electron acceptor in the anaerobic region and consequently increase the degradation rate of sodium acetate caffeine and its intermediate products which resulted in lower cod concentration the aerated bioreactor phase v performed 3 better than the non aerated bioreactor phase vi while planted bioreactor phase vi also enhanced 3 of cod reduction compared to the non planted bioreactor as shown in table 2 even though the percentage difference in total cod removal efficiency was low the effect of aeration and plant was statistically significantly affected the total cod removal performance in ufcw mfc p 0 05 the significant difference between phases v and vi indicates that aeration enhanced the degradation of residual caffeine and its intermediates supplementary aeration could improve the degradation of organic matter through the oxidation process as well as aerobic biodegradation 42 the significant influence of the macrophyte on the removal of cod demonstrates the importance of the macrophyte despite it did not significantly improve the caffeine degradation in this study the enhancement of cod reduction could be due to the removal of the intermediates the rhizosphere of the plant could provide carbon sources to the microbes through the root exudates which could enhance the degradation of organic matter in addition the release of oxygen by the plant to the adjacent microenvironment via oxygen radial loss could also stimulate the growth of the aerobes and consequently improve the degradation of organic matter 38 the removal performance of ammonium in ufcw mfc was also studied in different operating conditions fig 5 b shows that circuit connection did not affect the ammonium removal efficiency p 0 05 while the influence of aeration and plant was statistically significant in this study p 0 05 the aerated bioreactor phase v performed 100 better than the non aerated bioreactor phase vi while the ammonium removal efficiency in the planted bioreactor phase vi was 9 higher than the non planted bioreactor phase vii the significant difference between aerated and non aerated bioreactors was because nitrification is more favorable to occur under the aerobic environment the better performance of the planted bioreactor compared to the non planted bioreactor in ammonium removal was consistent with the previous study 18 the macrophyte could improve the removal of ammonium through the uptake from the roots as well as the leakage of oxygen which promoted the growth of nitrifying bacteria in the surroundings a declining trend from sampling point s3 to s5 and negative ammonium removal efficiency was observed in phases vi and vii this was induced by the lack of dissolved oxygen for the nitrification process besides the increase of ammonium ions during the degradation of caffeine has further decreased the ammonium removal efficiency and consequently resulted in negative removal efficiency the results further supported the degradation pathway of caffeine where ammonia is produced in the process of caffeine biodegradation the nitrate removal performance in different operating conditions was also assessed in this study and the results show that aeration was the main factor in influencing the denitrification process as shown in fig 5 c the denitrification efficiency achieved 92 for phases vi and vii where the bioreactor operated without supplementary aeration while only 26 of nitrate removal for aerated bioreactor phases iv and v the denitrification process was preferred to occur in an anaerobic environment and inhibited in aerobic conditions 43 moreover the nitrification process also contributed to the increase of nitrate concentration in the aerobic region as a result the concentration of nitrate was higher at the effluent when supplementary aeration was supplied compared to the non aerated bioreactor the effect of circuit connection and plant was not notable in this study p 0 05 as mentioned in the previous section nitrate could be utilized as the electron acceptor for the denitrification process which was expected to compete with the anode for receiving the electrons the insignificant effect of circuit connection in this study indicates that the electrons required for the denitrification process were adequate regardless of the presence of anode this could be observed at sampling point s1 where most of the nitrate was successfully removed 90 as for the effect of the plant the insignificant effect on the denitrification efficiency was largely due to most of the nitrate was being treated in the lower part of the bioreactor 3 3 bioelectricity generation in ufcw mfc system the potential of utilizing caffeine as the fuel for bioelectricity generation was assessed through the voltage output and power densities produced to reflect the effect of electrode spacing on bioelectricity generation three anodes were embedded in the different heights of the bioreactor the spacing between the anodes and the cathode was 15 cm c a1 30 cm c a2 and 45 cm c a3 respectively the voltage output of ufcw mfc in various concentrations of caffeine and different electrode spacings was shown in table 3 in general the highest voltage output was observed at the smallest electrode spacing c a1 despite the concentration of caffeine introduced the results indicate that voltage output was correlated to the electrode spacing where voltage produced increased with the decrease of electrode spacing 30 the capability of caffeine as the fuel for the microbes to generate electrons at the anodic region was explored in this study as shown in table 3 the voltage output increase corresponding to the increment of caffeine concentration which recorded an average of 415 4 465 2 534 0 and 552 9 mv for phases i ii iii and iv respectively the effect of caffeine concentration induced an increment of 1 12 1 15 and 1 04 times from phases i to ii ii to iii and iii to iv respectively according to the anova and tukey analysis there was a remarkable difference in the voltage output between phases i ii and ii iii whereas the increment of voltage from phase iii to iv was insignificant the results demonstrate that caffeine has shown its latent ability to be converted to electricity while being treated to a less toxic product the insignificant increment of voltage from 100 to 300 mg l of caffeine was mainly due to the excess of unutilized organic matter entering the cathode as shown in the cod removal profile fig 5 a tan et al 31 reported that the voltage output initially increase corresponding to the increment of substrate concentration and showed a decrement trend when the organic substrate exceed the capability of anaerobes to oxidize the organic matter in the anodic region similarly villaseñor et al 24 demonstrated that when excessive organic matter enters the cathodic zone the consumption of oxygen for the degradation of organic matter would be increased and driven to the decrement of the utilization of oxygen as the electron acceptor for electricity generation thus the entering of the excess untreated caffeine and intermediates from the anode to the cathode might be the reason for the insignificant increment of voltage from 100 to 300 mg l of caffeine in this study the maximum power density was found to be the highest at the shortest distance between anode and cathode c a1 contributed the highest maximum power density followed by c a2 and c a3 the increment of power density with the decrement of electrode spacing was induced by the reduction of internal resistance as shown in table 3 this indicates that the power density generated by the ufcw mfc could be enhanced by minimizing the electrode spacing between anode and cathode 12 fig 6 depicts the polarization curve a power density curve b and ce and ner c at various concentrations of caffeine the power density shows an inclined trend with the increment of caffeine concentration fig 6 b the maximum power density was obtained in phase iv 185 75 25 20 mw m3 which was 9 1 45 3 and 71 5 higher than phases iii 170 23 10 88 mw m3 ii 127 83 10 75 mw m3 and i 108 29 8 71 mw m3 respectively table 4 shows some of the previous studies on the effect of substrate concentration on the power density produced in cw mfc as shown in table 4 most of the previous studies demonstrated the increment trend of power density generated corresponding to the increase of organic substrate concentration which was consistent with the current study it was notable that the power density of liu et al 44 showed decrement after the initial increment with the increase of substrate concentration liu et al 44 indicated that under high influent cod concentration the organic matter could not be fully oxidized in the anaerobic region and the unutilized organic matter flowed to the cathodic compartment which consequently diminished the potential difference between anode and cathode and reduced the power output similar to liu et al 44 the increment of maximum power density from 100 to 300 mg l of caffeine concentration was only 9 1 which was insignificant compared to the increment of other phases this could be owing to the excess of non oxidized organic matter 128 mg l at s3 in phase iv reaching the cathode and consuming the oxygen for the oxidization of organic matter the power density obtained in this study was comparable to the previous studies as shown in table 4 this indicated that caffeine possess the potential of being utilized as carbon sources by the microbes along with other substrates for the direct electricity generation the internal resistance of the system demonstrates a similar trend to the power density the internal resistance was reduced with the increase of caffeine concentration caffeine and its intermediate such as xanthine could provide the electrons required for electricity generation due to their good electron donor properties 45 hence more electrons were received by the anode and stimulated the transfer rate of electrons from anode to cathode which could lower the internal resistance and contributed to higher power output the reduction of internal resistance was more obvious at c a2 and c a3 since most of the organic matter was consumed at the lower compartment of the bioreactor to reflect the effectiveness of ufcw mfc in the retrieval of energy coulombic efficiency ce was evaluated as shown in table 3 and fig 6 c the highest ce value was obtained at the smallest electrode spacing regardless of the concentration of caffeine the result was consistent with the previous study which could be due to the less competition of electrons at the upper part of the bioreactor 18 the anodes were positioned from the bottom part to the upper part of the bioreactor in the order of c a3 c a2 and c a1 the competition of electrons for the processes such as methanogenesis denitrification and the anode at the c a3 and c a2 was much higher than c a1 46 consequently more electrons were available to produce electricity in c a1 and thus contributed to the highest ce the effect of caffeine concentration on ce was revealed in fig 6 c the ce obtained in this study was 26 94 6 28 3 09 and 1 29 for phases i ii iii and iv respectively the ce shows a declined trend as the concentration of caffeine increased this could be mainly due to the increase in influent cod as ce was highly dependent on the cod removed martin et al 47 reported a similar trend where the ce decreased with the increase of organic loading rate the study indicated that too high organic loading could promote the growth of methanogenic microorganisms and lead to the decrease of ce obtained the increase of cod tends to decrease the ce as only certain microbes in the population are responsible for the generation of electricity 48 in addition caffeine could be converted to methane under anaerobic conditions through the methanogenesis process 6 since mixed cultures sludge was used for inoculation in this study it was expected that caffeine was partially utilized by the methanogens to produce methane hence the electrons available for the generation of electricity were reduced and subsequently decreased the ce as the caffeine concentration increased energy recovery from the wastewater in the ufcw mfc system was also assessed by calculating normalized energy recovery ner based on removal of substrates ners and the volume of wastewater treated nerv 49 both ners and nerv demonstrated a similar trend to the ce in terms of the effect of electrode spacing the ners and nerv were found to be the highest at the smallest electrode spacing of c a1 followed by c a2 and c a3 as shown in table 3 on the other hand the concentration of caffeine affected the ners and nerv differently fig 6 c shows the effect of caffeine concentration on ners and nerv ners exhibits the increase in the concentration of caffeine could decrease the performance of ners whereas nerv displays an inclined trend as the caffeine concentration increased ners was highly dependent on the influent cod as it was evaluated based on the amount of organic matter converted to the energy therefore ners decreased correspondingly to the increase of caffeine concentration since not all substrates degraded were associated with the production of energy nerv was assessed in terms of the treated volume of wastewater and not affected by the cod hence more electrons were available for energy generation as the concentration of caffeine increased and subsequently increased the nerv 4 conclusion this study has shown the capability of ufcw mfc in converting various concentrations of caffeine to electrons for electricity generation ufcw mfc successfully removed 98 of caffeine and achieved 51 of toxicity reduction the degradation pathway demonstrates the catabolism of caffeine to less toxic products the closed circuit performed about 5 better than the open circuit in terms of caffeine and cod removal in the anaerobic region this shows that integration of the mfc feature into cw could enhance the degradation of caffeine and intermediates in the anodic region supplementary aeration and macrophyte improved 100 and 9 of ammonium removal compared to bioreactor operated without aeration and plant respectively both supplementary aeration and macrophyte play an essential role in removing the excess ammonium ions produced during the caffeine catabolism in addition supplementary aeration was also required for the further degradation of unconsumed caffeine and its intermediates the role of the plant was not significantly contributed to the caffeine removal in this study which could be due to low hrt the highest voltage and maximum power density were observed at phase iv 552 9 mv and 185 75 mw m3 respectively which indicated caffeine could be used as a fuel for electricity generation in ufcw mfc declaration of competing interest the authors

13163,this study explored the potential of caffeine being utilized as the fuel for the microbes to produce electrons for electricity generation in up flow constructed wetland microbial fuel cell ufcw mfc the effect of caffeine concentration was investigated to identify the availability of ufcw mfc in the conversion of caffeine to electrons for electricity production and the effect of operating conditions circuit connection supplementary aeration and plant was studied to determine their significance in the treatment of caffeine containing wastewater the ufcw mfc achieved about 98 of decaffeination efficiency regardless of caffeine concentration while a decrease of efficiency was observed when ufcw mfc operated without supplementary aeration and plant 93 cod removal efficiency decreased correspondingly to the increase of caffeine concentration which could be contributed by the higher concentration of caffeine and its intermediates the degradation pathway of caffeine in ufcw mfc was explored in this study it was remarkable that ammonia was produced and converted to ammonium ions during caffeine catabolism supplementary aeration and macrophyte play a crucial role in removing excess caffeine intermediates as well as accumulated ammonium ions the toxicity assessment revealed that caffeine was degraded to less toxic products the closed circuit connection not only contributed to electricity generation but also enhanced the caffeine and cod removal efficiency by 4 6 and 5 4 in the anaerobic region respectively the increase of voltage and maximum power density from phase i to phase iv indicated that caffeine could be converted to electrons by the anaerobes for electricity production graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords caffeine constructed wetland microbial fuel cell degradation pathway electricity generation toxicity assessment 1 introduction in recent years the removal of emerging organic micropollutants has gained interest in the field of wastewater treatment these anthropogenic compounds consist of industrial chemicals personal care pharmaceutical product and their respective intermediate products 1 even though most of these compounds were only traceable in extremely low concentrations in the aquatic environment chronic exposure to these compounds might lead to numerous adverse effects on the ecosystem and living organisms 2 therefore the development of effective methods for the treatment of wastewater containing these emerging micropollutants has drawn the attention of researchers caffeine 1 3 7 trimethylxanthine is a purine alkaloid that occurs naturally in many plant species including coffee seeds tea leaves citrus fruits and cocoa bean seeds 3 besides caffeine is also widely used as a stimulant or adjuvant in the pharmaceutical industry 4 caffeine has been consistently detected in the surface waters due to the continuous discharge of wastewater from industries hospitals and households the caffeine concentration in the aquatic environment is wide ranging ng mg l with relatively high values in wastewater and surface water 5 in the study of chen et al 6 the wastewater made of coffee and milk processing wastewater consists of 470 100 mg l caffeine concentration the high value of caffeine should be treated before releasing to the surface water caffeine is known to be persistent in the water environment because of its high solubility and negligible volatility the persistence of caffeine could lead to a major environmental concern due to its adverse effects on the environment such as aquatic toxicity antibiotic resistant bacteria development genotoxicity and hormonal disturbances 7 several physical and chemical treatment techniques on caffeine removal have been previously studied such as adsorption advanced oxidative processes and membrane separation 8 however these methods are low cost effective and could contribute to secondary pollutants which require additional treatments to further remove the secondary pollutants alternatively bioremediation techniques are environmentally friendly ecologically comprehensive and sustainable reclamation strategies 9 microorganisms and plants can remove organic contaminants through bioadsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation process thus further research on bioremediation techniques should be carried out to enhance the removal of caffeine from the aquatic environment hybrid system of constructed wetland and microbial fuel cell cw mfc is an emerging treatment system that is used to treat wastewater and produce electricity simultaneously 10 11 in an up flow cw mfc ufcw mfc a significant dissolved oxygen concentration gradient is established vertically where the aerobic region is developed at the upper bed and the anaerobic region is developed at the lower bed of the bioreactor cw mfc is capable of converting the organic matter in the wastewater to electricity through microbial activity the electrogenic bacteria that exist in the anode utilize the substrates as the fuel source for metabolic activities and produce electrons at the same time the anode is then served as the terminal electron acceptor and transfers the electrons to the cathode which served as the electron acceptor via an external circuit to generate electricity 12 cw mfc has shown its potential in treating various types of wastewater such as swine slurry removal 13 dye decolourization 14 and antibiotic degradation 15 caffeine containing wastewater treatment has been previously studied using cw 16 and mfc 17 however there is still a lack of study on the treatment of caffeine containing wastewater in the hybrid system in addition the process of caffeine degradation has been mostly reported in the aerobic environment while there are limited studies on the anaerobic degradation of caffeine therefore this study aimed to explore the potential of converting caffeine containing wastewater to electricity using ufcw mfc with various concentrations of caffeine the removal of caffeine was more focused on the anodic region since it was crucial to determine whether caffeine could be used as the substrate for the anaerobes to produce electrons which is needed for electricity generation moreover the treatment performance of caffeine containing wastewater was investigated under different operating conditions circuit connection aeration and macrophyte the results were analyzed with the statistical analysis analysis of variance and tukey kramer test to determine the significance of caffeine concentration on the performance of ufcw mfc as well as the significance of operating conditions on the caffeine containing wastewater treatment efficiency the toxicity of untreated and treated caffeine containing wastewater was also investigated in this study for the evaluation of the efficiency of ufcw mfc in treating caffeine containing wastewater the degradation pathway of caffeine in ufcw mfc was also proposed based on the results from the gas chromatography mass spectrum gc ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 ufcw mfc setup and operation the bioreactor was built up with an acrylic column with a height of 75 cm and a diameter of 17 5 cm as previously described in teoh et al 18 the bioreactor was established outdoor with a temperature of 28 3 c to develop an even flow of wastewater the bottom of the bioreactor was filled with 1 cm diameter of glass beads up to 3 cm gravel with a diameter of 0 6 cm was served as the substrate of constructed wetland and the electrodes used in this study were granular activated carbon five sampling points were developed at 7 21 36 51 and 66 cm from the bottom of the bioreactor fig 1 shows the structures of ufcw mfc to assess the effect of electrode spacing on electricity generation the bioreactor was embedded with three layers of the anode at the lower region 8 cm 23 cm and 38 cm from the bottom of the wetland bed on the other hand the cathode was developed at the upper region of the bioreactor 53 cm from the bottom of the bioreactor the volume of the electrodes was 2405 59 cm3 the activated carbon and gravel were inoculated with mixed culture sludge obtained from the wastewater treatment plant of shorubber m sdn bhd a glove manufacturing company resistor 1000 ω carbon rods stainless steel and copper wires were

the caffeine concentration circuit connection aeration and plant on wastewater treatment and energy production performance at phase i the ufcw mfc was operated as the control with 0 mg l of caffeine 50 100 and 300 mg l of caffeine were added to the synthetic wastewater at phases ii iii and iv respectively to assess the influence of caffeine concentration on the performance of ufcw mfc open circuit mode was carried out at phase v to evaluate the influence of circuit connection on caffeine containing wastewater treatment performance the supplementary aeration and plant were removed at phases vi and vii respectively for the study of the effect of aeration and plant on the treatment of caffeine containing wastewater the operation sequence was summarised in table 1 the composition of synthetic wastewater was 409 8 mg l ch3coona 176 1 mg l nh4no3 3 4 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 7 0 mg l nacl 36 7 mg l k2hpo4 and 4 0 mg l cacl2 2h2o a peristaltic pump huiyu bt100j 1a china was used for the continuous feeding of the synthetic wastewater with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 day 2 2 analysis the caffeine containing wastewater treatment performance along the ufcw mfc bioreactor was

300 ml of samples with 10 ml of dichloromethane before the gc ms analysis 19 the mass spectra obtained from the gc ms were used for the identification of the intermediates and by products of degraded

system was evaluated in this study the wastewater treatment performance of ufcw mfc was outlined in table 2 fig 2 shows the decaffeination efficiency of synthetic wastewater along the ufcw mfc bioreactor around 98 of total decaffeination efficiency was able to be achieved in this study the removal efficiency of caffeine in this study was comparable to the previous study of oliveira et al 16 and yap et al 17 which used vertical flow constructed wetland and doubled chambered microbial fuel cell for the degradation of caffeine respectively a 94 of caffeine removal was observed from the study of oliveira et al 16 with e crassipes as the macrophyte and a 97 of decaffeination efficiency was achieved in yap et al 17 with caffeine being treated in the cathode chamber this study demonstrates the capability of decaffeination in the hybrid system of cw and mfc was comparable and might enhance the degradation of caffeine compared with cw and mfc alone while converting it to electricity simultaneously biodegradation was the main process in removing caffeine from synthetic wastewater 21 in the ufcw mfc system the anaerobic and aerobic process was involved in caffeine removal though the removal of caffeine was well known to occur in the aerobic environment there are still limited studies on decaffeination in the anaerobic environment previous studies have shown the potential of treating caffeine containing wastewater using an anaerobic process chen et al 6 has successfully degraded the caffeine using the methanogenesis process in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor the study achieved an 87 5 of caffeine removal efficiency and converted the caffeine to methane gas by applying a similar concept to ufcw mfc caffeine can be degraded by the anaerobes and produced electrons for electricity generation as shown in fig 2 the decaffeination process was mainly occurred in the anaerobic region s1 s3 which achieved 80 92 of total removal efficiency caffeine consists of carbon and nitrogen in its heterocyclic structure which can be utilized as the fuel for the microbes to sustain their activity and growth 3 as a result caffeine was degraded by the anaerobes and significantly removed in the anaerobic region the residual caffeine was further degraded in the aerobic region where supplementary aeration and plant were placed the effect of caffeine concentration on decaffeination performance was investigated by preparing 50 100 and 300 mg l of caffeine as the influent to study the removal performance along the bioreactor as shown in table 2 the total decaffeination efficiency of 50 100 and 300 mg l of caffeine was 97 3 98 5 and 98 3 respectively the results indicated that the ufcw mfc system exhibits the capability of removing various concentrations of caffeine at a high removal efficiency in this study caffeine was mainly degraded at the anodic region which contributed to 91 5 86 3 and 79 7 as the caffeine concentration increased from 50 to 300 mg l respectively this indicated that ufcw mfc possesses the potential of degrading caffeine through anaerobic microbial degradation and converting them to electrons as the concentration increased from 50 to 100 and 300 mg l the decaffeination efficiency in the anaerobic region decreased correspondingly to the increase of caffeine the most significant difference in decaffeination efficiency can be observed at sampling point s1 where the decaffeination efficiency decreased from 84 0 to 81 2 followed by declining to 57 8 corresponding to the increase of caffeine concentration from 50 to 100 and 300 mg l despite the removal efficiency decreased along with the increase of caffeine concentration the amount of caffeine treated inclined with the increase of caffeine concentration which contributed 42 63 82 26 and 173 15 mg l of caffeine removal at s1 for phases ii iii and iv respectively anova was used to analyze the significant difference among the various caffeine concentration tukey kramer test was also performed as a post hoc test to further analyze the significance of the caffeine concentration in the anaerobic degradation the statistical analysis shows that there was a significant increase of caffeine concentration treated when the caffeine increased from 50 to 100 and 300 mg l where the p value is less than 0 05 at sampling point s1 the significant increment of treated caffeine could lead to the increase of electrons produced as the microbes tend to consume more carbon sources to sustain their metabolism rate when the carbon source increased 22 as a result more electrons could be accepted by the anode and transferred to the cathode for electricity generation oon et al 23 also demonstrated that more organic matter was degraded when the carbon sources were doubled which contributed to the production of more electrons on the other hand the residual caffeine concentration at the end of the anodic region s3 was 4 31 13 82 and 60 71 mg l for phases ii iii and iv respectively the statistical analysis reveals that there was no significant difference when caffeine concentration increased from 50 to 100 mg l p 0 05 while there was a significant difference when the concentration of caffeine increased from 100 to 300 mg l p 0 05 at s3 this indicates that caffeine was degraded to a very low concentration at the end of anaerobic treatment for the lower concentration of caffeine whereas for 300 mg l of initial caffeine there was still a lot of caffeine that remained untreated before entering the aerobic region the high amount of remaining caffeine entering the cathodic region could consume the oxygen in the cathodic region and consequently reduced the oxygen available for the electricity generation to further support the findings the untreated caffeine from s3 was reduced by 2 74 12 21 and 55 44 mg l for phases ii iii and iv respectively in the aerobic region as a result more oxygen was consumed for the degradation of caffeine instead of utilized as the electrons acceptor for the generation of electricity do concentration slightly decreased from 4 52 6 26 mg l to 4 32 5 81 mg l in the aerobic region when caffeine concentration increased to 300 mg l similar findings were found in the study of villaseñor et al 24 where the organic matter was not completely oxidized in the anodic region and consumed the dissolved oxygen in the upper zone due to the higher oxygen demand the higher consumption of oxygen in the cathodic region could slightly hinder the increment of electricity production despite the increment of caffeine concentration which will be further discussed in section 3 3 in a short conclusion the results demonstrated the capability of removing various concentrations of caffeine in the anaerobic environment and the potential of converting caffeine to produce electricity in the ufcw mfc system the influence of operating conditions circuit connection aeration and plant on the total decaffeination performance was explored to investigate the treatment mechanism of caffeine in the ufcw mfc system anova and tukey kramer test were performed to analyze the significance of the operating conditions the total decaffeination efficiency was 98 3 98 5 93 0 and 92 4 for phases iv v vi and vii respectively as outlined in table 2 according to anova there is a significant difference p 0 05 among the operating parameters tukey post hoc test was then conducted by pairing the operating parameters phases iv v iv vi iv vii v vi v vii vi vii the main pairs used for the analysis of the operating conditions were iv v circuit connection v vi aeration and vi vii plant the results show that there was no statistically significant difference between the pairings of iv v and vi vii p 0 05 while v vi pairing shows a significant difference p 0 05 this indicates that the influence of circuit connection and the presence of macrophytes on the total decaffeination in the ufcw mfc system was not significant while aeration plays an important role in the complete degradation of caffeine aerobic condition is more favorable for caffeine catabolism as it increases the degradation rate of caffeine compared to anaerobic conditions 25 the effect of circuit connection on the total caffeine removal was not significant due to the strong effect of aeration at the aerobic region for the effect of macrophytes previous studies have demonstrated that plants could enhance the removal of caffeine through the uptake from the roots 1 in this study the insignificant improvement of caffeine degradation performance by the plant may be due to the low hrt 1 day oliveira et al 16 reported that e crassipes could remove 41 7 of 27 mg l of caffeine with an hrt of 7 days hence the effect of the plant on decaffeination is expected to be more significant with a higher hrt the effect of operating conditions on decaffeination was also evaluated at the anaerobic region as well since it is crucial for the conversion of caffeine to electricity similarly anova and tukey post hoc tests were conducted for the evaluation phase iv performed 4 6 better than phase v and around 10 better than phase vi and vii from the statistical perspective anova demonstrates that the effect of operating conditions on decaffeination in the anaerobic region is significant p 0 05 tukey test identified that iv v and v vi pairings show a statistically significant difference p 0 05 whereas vi vii pairing was not different significantly p 0 05 the results indicated that the presence of the anode and external circuit closed circuit not only can be used as the path for electricity generation but also could improve the degradation of caffeine the closed circuit connection allowed the electrons to transfer from anode to cathode and could promote the growth of electrogenic bacteria 26 consequently the transfer of electrons and the growth of microbes facilitated the degradation rate of caffeine in the anodic region and thus lead to a better removal efficiency of caffeine the integration of the mfc feature to cw shows the improvement of caffeine degradation and better treatment performance than the cw alone especially in the anaerobic region the significant difference between v vi pairing in this study was mainly due to the partial diffusion of oxygen from sampling point s4 to s3 where supplementary aeration was provided during phase v as shown in fig s1 the dissolved oxygen of phase v was slightly higher compared to phase vi at s3 the slight aerobic condition was contributed to a better removal at s3 in phase v compared to phase vi in summary ufcw mfc operated in the closed circuit could enhance the decaffeination process in the anaerobic region while supplementary aeration is needed to further degrade the residual caffeine the presence of macrophytes does not significantly improve the removal of caffeine in this study but the effect of the plant is expected to be more significant when operated at a higher hrt the significance of the operating conditions on decaffeination in the ufcw mfc system was ranked in order of supplementary aeration circuit connection plant 3 1 2 toxicity assessment to assess the impact of caffeine on living organisms and the effectiveness of the ufcw mfc system on removing the toxicity of caffeine a phytotoxicity assessment was conducted the assessment was carried out by using lettuce seeds as the bioindicators to identify the toxicity level of caffeine through the comparison of radicle length as shown in fig 3 synthetic wastewater containing 50 mg l of caffeine could contribute to a 55 6 of toxicity level the toxicity level was increased by 11 5 to 67 1 and further increased by 26 9 to 94 when the caffeine concentration increased from 50 to 100 mg l and 100 to 300 mg l respectively the results indicate that caffeine with a concentration of 50 and 100 mg l could moderately inhibit the growth of lettuce seeds whereas 300 mg l of caffeine could seriously hinder the growth due to its toxicity it was notable that the toxicity level of the synthetic wastewater was decreased significantly after the treatment ufcw mfc system has shown its effectiveness on decaffeination by reducing 19 9 24 7 and 50 9 of toxicity levels for phases ii iii and iv respectively the reduction of toxicity indicated that the intermediate product of caffeine is less toxic compared to its parental product tarka and cornish 27 also reported that caffeine was more toxic compared to its intermediates of theobromine and theophylline the operating conditions of the ufcw mfc bioreactor did not significantly affect the toxic removal in this study as most of the caffeine was removed at the end of the treatment 3 1 3 degradation pathway the catabolic pathway of caffeine in the ufcw mfc system was proposed based on the results of the gc ms analysis fig 4 depicts the proposed degradation pathway of caffeine in the ufcw mfc bioreactor gummadi et al 3 reported that caffeine is catabolized via two major pathways which are demethylation and oxidation in the ufcw mfc system the synthetic wastewater was first treated anaerobically followed by aerobic degradation hence caffeine was expected to undergo three demethylation processes to form theobromine paraxanthine which further converts to 7 methylxanthine and finally to xanthine the methyl groups that split off during the demethylation process were generally hydrolyzed to methanol which was then converted to carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o the intermediate product xanthine was then oxidized to uric acid and further degraded to allantoin 28 allantoin was presumed to undergo the hydrolysis process to form allantoic acid and further hydrolyzed to form ureidoglycine and produced co2 and ammonia nh3 ureidoglycine could subsequently be hydrolyzed to ureidoglycolic acid and nh3 ureidoglycolic acid could be further degraded to oxaluric acid urea and glyoxylic acid which was generally degraded to oxalic acid co2 h2o and nh3 3 2 cod ammonium and nitrate ion removal 3 2 1 effect of caffeine concentration the average influent cod concentration of synthetic wastewater phase i was 314 mg l as shown in table 2 the cod concentration increased when the caffeine was added which contribute to a total cod of 369 428 and 647 mg l for phases ii iii and iv respectively the increase of cod concentration indicates that caffeine possesses the potential of being used as the substrate for microbial activity fig 5 a demonstrates the cod removal in the ufcw mfc bioreactor a 99 6 98 1 96 0 and 91 7 of total cod removal efficiency was achieved for phases i ii iii and iv respectively in this study statistical analysis was carried out via anova and tukey test to assess the influence of caffeine concentration on the cod removal performance in the ufcw mfc system the analysis results reveal that caffeine concentration significantly affects the total removal of cod in the ufcw mfc p 0 05 this could be possibly due to the intermediates produced during the degradation of caffeine according to indermuhle et al 29 which study the degradation of caffeine using conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation reported that the removal rate of caffeine faster than the total organic carbon indicated the formation of the intermediates could increase the carbon concentration similarly most of the caffeine 98 was removed at the end of treatment in this study as shown in fig 2 hence it was presumed that the unconsumed intermediate products of caffeine were responsible for the residual cod in the effluent as the concentration of caffeine increased the formation of intermediate products also increased which consequently decreased the total cod removal efficiency the removal of cod mainly occurred in the anaerobic region as shown in fig 5 a where a sharp increment of cod removal efficiency from influent to s1 followed by a steady increment from s1 to s3 was observed the anaerobic process contributed 98 7 96 6 92 8 and 80 3 of cod removal efficiency for phases i ii iii and iv respectively the organic matter in the wastewater was utilized as the fuel for microbial metabolism and growth which could lead to high cod removal efficiency in the anaerobic region 30 fig 5 a depicts that there was a decrement in cod removal efficiency corresponding to the increment of caffeine concentration based on the control phase i sodium acetate was the main contributor to the cod and it was almost completely degraded in the anaerobic region therefore the decrement was mainly due to the residual caffeine and its intermediate products anova and tukey test show that the residual cod in the anaerobic region was not significant when 50 and 100 mg l of caffeine was introduced to the synthetic wastewater p 0 05 whereas for 300 mg l of caffeine the residual cod concentration was significantly higher in the anaerobic region compared to the others p 0 05 the results suggest that most of the caffeine and its intermediate products were degraded in the anaerobic region for phases ii and iii while there was a portion of caffeine and intermediates remained untreated at the end of anaerobic treatment for phase iv the trend of cod removal was similar to the decaffeination where the removal of cod concentration increased despite the decrement in the removal efficiency as the caffeine concentration increased from 0 to 300 mg l a total of 310 356 397 and 520 mg l of cod was removed in the anaerobic region s1 s3 for phases i ii iii and iv respectively according to anova and tukey test the increase of cod treated corresponding to the increase of initial caffeine concentration was statistically significant p 0 05 the significant increment of cod removal could be contributed by the degradation of caffeine and its intermediates via the microbial activities when the caffeine was added to the synthetic wastewater at phase ii and increased to 100 and 300 mg l at phases iii and iv respectively the results suggest that the anaerobes were capable of oxidizing the organic matter including sodium acetate caffeine and the intermediates at a high efficiency for phases ii and iii in the anodic region as the microorganisms tend to consume more carbon sources when available 31 while the concentration of organic matter was a bit high for the microbes to completely consumed for phase iv in the anaerobic region which could be due to the high concentration of caffeine as well as the intermediates produced during the decaffeination process the unutilized organic substrates were further degraded in the aerobic region s4 and s5 by the aerobes where the supplementary aeration and plant were provided to the bioreactor 32 ammonia is known to be capable of causing adverse effects to the aquatic environment when released at significant levels in an aqueous solution ammonia could convert to ammonium ions nh4 when ph is low 33 the equilibrium equation was shown in eq 8 8 nh 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h in the ufcw mfc system nitrification is the main route for the removal of ammonium ions the nitrification process is favorable to occur in the aerobic environment where the oxidation is carried out in two steps by two different bacteria groups the ammonium ions were first oxidized by the nitrosomonas to nitrite no2 while nitrobacter further oxidized nitrite to nitrate no3 34 the nitrification process was shown as follow 9 nh 4 3 2 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o 10 no 2 1 2 o 2 no 3 the effect of caffeine concentration on ammonium ion removal was assessed in this study as shown in fig 5 b the total nitrification efficiency was 97 3 96 1 96 0 and 88 7 for phases i ii iii and iv respectively anova and tukey test suggest that the effect of caffeine concentration was only significant when the concentration increase to 300 mg l p 0 05 a more significant difference was observed in the anaerobic region where the ammonium removal efficiency of 300 mg l of caffeine shows a decrement of 16 from sampling point s2 to s3 it was notable that the trend of ammonium removal in phase iv was different from the previous study of teoh et al 18 where the synthetic wastewater used was free of caffeine the ammonium ions removal in teoh et al 18 was similar to phase i where the ammonium ions slightly decreased and remained almost constant in the anaerobic region s1 s3 while there was a significant increment of ammonium concentration from s2 to s3 in this study for phase iv the significant difference in the trend between the synthetic wastewater with and without caffeine suggests that caffeine was the main factor that contributed to this difference as mentioned in the caffeine degradation pathway section section 3 1 3 nh3 was produced in the process of caffeine degradation the nh3 produced tends to be converted to ammonium ions due to the slightly low ph 6 80 which could lead to the increase of ammonium ions concentration 35 thus the decrement of ammonium removal efficiency from s2 to s3 was mainly induced by the accumulated nh3 produced during the degradation of caffeine moreover unionized ammonia can cause toxicity to nitrosomonas and nitrobacter bacteria and inhibit the nitrification process 36 as a result the nitrification efficiency decreased with the increase of caffeine concentration anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox was also another alternative pathway for the removal of ammonium anammox occurred under an anaerobic environment where the ammonium was oxidized to n2 by autotrophic anammox bacteria 37 as shown in fig 5 b a small portion of ammonium 10 24 was removed in the anaerobic region which could be contributed by the anammox process oon et al 38 reported a similar finding where anammox contributed 12 of ammonium removal in the anaerobic region nitrate possesses toxicity that could cause harmful effects on the aquatic animal the nitrate toxicity was attributed to the nitrate ions as the nitrate ion does not form an unionized species in the aquatic environment 36 nitrate was mainly removed through the denitrification process in ufcw mfc the denitrification process occurred in the lower part of the bioreactor which was in an anaerobic environment the denitrification process involved the activity of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as pseudomonas micrococcus bacillus and achromobacter nitrate could be used as the terminal electron acceptor by the facultative anaerobic bacteria and converted to nitrite and ultimately to nitrogen no3 no2 n2 39 fig 5 c demonstrates the effect of caffeine concentration on nitrate removal performance in the ufcw mfc bioreactor the total denitrification efficiency was relatively low which only contributed 40 7 39 3 37 3 and 25 8 of nitrate removal for phases i ii iii and iv respectively the low nitrate removal efficiency was mainly attributed to the nitrification process which converted nh4 to no3 at the end of the treatment the low denitrification efficiency was consistent with previous studies where the conversion of ammonium ions to nitrate ions during the nitrification process at the upper part of the wetland bed greatly increased the nitrate concentration at the effluent 30 38 the denitrification efficiency of oon et al 30 and oon et al 38 was 40 and 50 respectively the results were comparable with phase i as the initial concentration of ammonium and nitrate was similar to this study the removal efficiency of nitrate shows decrement corresponding to the increment of the caffeine concentration added to the synthetic wastewater the effect of caffeine concentration on the total denitrification performance was significantly observed in phase iv based on the results of anova and tukey test p 0 05 the results were consistent with the nitrification process where the increment of the ammonium ions removal induced the increase of nitrate ions produced as a result the denitrification efficiency decreased with the increase of caffeine concentration in addition it was remarkable that the denitrification efficiency in the anaerobic region s1 s3 was almost the same which achieved approximately 92 despite the caffeine concentration for all phases this suggests that the nitrate removal was not directly affected by the degradation of caffeine but was affected by the nitrification of ammonia and ammonium ions produced during caffeine catabolism 3 2 2 effect of operating conditions the effect of operating conditions on cod removal performance was also investigated in this study according to the statistical analysis circuit connection phase iv v pairing shows no significant effect on the total cod removal efficiency p 0 05 which recorded 91 7 and 89 4 for closed and open circuits respectively however the closed circuit was significantly performed better in the anaerobic region p 0 05 the results were correlated to caffeine degradation this indicates that the significant difference in cod removal performance in the anaerobic region between closed and open circuits was mainly induced by the unutilized caffeine and its intermediate products the connection between anode and cathode was known to have the ability to enhance the degradation of organic matter through the transfer of electrons and the promotion of the growth of microbes 40 41 the presence of an anode could act as the terminal electron acceptor in the anaerobic region and consequently increase the degradation rate of sodium acetate caffeine and its intermediate products which resulted in lower cod concentration the aerated bioreactor phase v performed 3 better than the non aerated bioreactor phase vi while planted bioreactor phase vi also enhanced 3 of cod reduction compared to the non planted bioreactor as shown in table 2 even though the percentage difference in total cod removal efficiency was low the effect of aeration and plant was statistically significantly affected the total cod removal performance in ufcw mfc p 0 05 the significant difference between phases v and vi indicates that aeration enhanced the degradation of residual caffeine and its intermediates supplementary aeration could improve the degradation of organic matter through the oxidation process as well as aerobic biodegradation 42 the significant influence of the macrophyte on the removal of cod demonstrates the importance of the macrophyte despite it did not significantly improve the caffeine degradation in this study the enhancement of cod reduction could be due to the removal of the intermediates the rhizosphere of the plant could provide carbon sources to the microbes through the root exudates which could enhance the degradation of organic matter in addition the release of oxygen by the plant to the adjacent microenvironment via oxygen radial loss could also stimulate the growth of the aerobes and consequently improve the degradation of organic matter 38 the removal performance of ammonium in ufcw mfc was also studied in different operating conditions fig 5 b shows that circuit connection did not affect the ammonium removal efficiency p 0 05 while the influence of aeration and plant was statistically significant in this study p 0 05 the aerated bioreactor phase v performed 100 better than the non aerated bioreactor phase vi while the ammonium removal efficiency in the planted bioreactor phase vi was 9 higher than the non planted bioreactor phase vii the significant difference between aerated and non aerated bioreactors was because nitrification is more favorable to occur under the aerobic environment the better performance of the planted bioreactor compared to the non planted bioreactor in ammonium removal was consistent with the previous study 18 the macrophyte could improve the removal of ammonium through the uptake from the roots as well as the leakage of oxygen which promoted the growth of nitrifying bacteria in the surroundings a declining trend from sampling point s3 to s5 and negative ammonium removal efficiency was observed in phases vi and vii this was induced by the lack of dissolved oxygen for the nitrification process besides the increase of ammonium ions during the degradation of caffeine has further decreased the ammonium removal efficiency and consequently resulted in negative removal efficiency the results further supported the degradation pathway of caffeine where ammonia is produced in the process of caffeine biodegradation the nitrate removal performance in different operating conditions was also assessed in this study and the results show that aeration was the main factor in influencing the denitrification process as shown in fig 5 c the denitrification efficiency achieved 92 for phases vi and vii where the bioreactor operated without supplementary aeration while only 26 of nitrate removal for aerated bioreactor phases iv and v the denitrification process was preferred to occur in an anaerobic environment and inhibited in aerobic conditions 43 moreover the nitrification process also contributed to the increase of nitrate concentration in the aerobic region as a result the concentration of nitrate was higher at the effluent when supplementary aeration was supplied compared to the non aerated bioreactor the effect of circuit connection and plant was not notable in this study p 0 05 as mentioned in the previous section nitrate could be utilized as the electron acceptor for the denitrification process which was expected to compete with the anode for receiving the electrons the insignificant effect of circuit connection in this study indicates that the electrons required for the denitrification process were adequate regardless of the presence of anode this could be observed at sampling point s1 where most of the nitrate was successfully removed 90 as for the effect of the plant the insignificant effect on the denitrification efficiency was largely due to most of the nitrate was being treated in the lower part of the bioreactor 3 3 bioelectricity generation in ufcw mfc system the potential of utilizing caffeine as the fuel for bioelectricity generation was assessed through the voltage output and power densities produced to reflect the effect of electrode spacing on bioelectricity generation three anodes were embedded in the different heights of the bioreactor the spacing between the anodes and the cathode was 15 cm c a1 30 cm c a2 and 45 cm c a3 respectively the voltage output of ufcw mfc in various concentrations of caffeine and different electrode spacings was shown in table 3 in general the highest voltage output was observed at the smallest electrode spacing c a1 despite the concentration of caffeine introduced the results indicate that voltage output was correlated to the electrode spacing where voltage produced increased with the decrease of electrode spacing 30 the capability of caffeine as the fuel for the microbes to generate electrons at the anodic region was explored in this study as shown in table 3 the voltage output increase corresponding to the increment of caffeine concentration which recorded an average of 415 4 465 2 534 0 and 552 9 mv for phases i ii iii and iv respectively the effect of caffeine concentration induced an increment of 1 12 1 15 and 1 04 times from phases i to ii ii to iii and iii to iv respectively according to the anova and tukey analysis there was a remarkable difference in the voltage output between phases i ii and ii iii whereas the increment of voltage from phase iii to iv was insignificant the results demonstrate that caffeine has shown its latent ability to be converted to electricity while being treated to a less toxic product the insignificant increment of voltage from 100 to 300 mg l of caffeine was mainly due to the excess of unutilized organic matter entering the cathode as shown in the cod removal profile fig 5 a tan et al 31 reported that the voltage output initially increase corresponding to the increment of substrate concentration and showed a decrement trend when the organic substrate exceed the capability of anaerobes to oxidize the organic matter in the anodic region similarly villaseñor et al 24 demonstrated that when excessive organic matter enters the cathodic zone the consumption of oxygen for the degradation of organic matter would be increased and driven to the decrement of the utilization of oxygen as the electron acceptor for electricity generation thus the entering of the excess untreated caffeine and intermediates from the anode to the cathode might be the reason for the insignificant increment of voltage from 100 to 300 mg l of caffeine in this study the maximum power density was found to be the highest at the shortest distance between anode and cathode c a1 contributed the highest maximum power density followed by c a2 and c a3 the increment of power density with the decrement of electrode spacing was induced by the reduction of internal resistance as shown in table 3 this indicates that the power density generated by the ufcw mfc could be enhanced by minimizing the electrode spacing between anode and cathode 12 fig 6 depicts the polarization curve a power density curve b and ce and ner c at various concentrations of caffeine the power density shows an inclined trend with the increment of caffeine concentration fig 6 b the maximum power density was obtained in phase iv 185 75 25 20 mw m3 which was 9 1 45 3 and 71 5 higher than phases iii 170 23 10 88 mw m3 ii 127 83 10 75 mw m3 and i 108 29 8 71 mw m3 respectively table 4 shows some of the previous studies on the effect of substrate concentration on the power density produced in cw mfc as shown in table 4 most of the previous studies demonstrated the increment trend of power density generated corresponding to the increase of organic substrate concentration which was consistent with the current study it was notable that the power density of liu et al 44 showed decrement after the initial increment with the increase of substrate concentration liu et al 44 indicated that under high influent cod concentration the organic matter could not be fully oxidized in the anaerobic region and the unutilized organic matter flowed to the cathodic compartment which consequently diminished the potential difference between anode and cathode and reduced the power output similar to liu et al 44 the increment of maximum power density from 100 to 300 mg l of caffeine concentration was only 9 1 which was insignificant compared to the increment of other phases this could be owing to the excess of non oxidized organic matter 128 mg l at s3 in phase iv reaching the cathode and consuming the oxygen for the oxidization of organic matter the power density obtained in this study was comparable to the previous studies as shown in table 4 this indicated that caffeine possess the potential of being utilized as carbon sources by the microbes along with other substrates for the direct electricity generation the internal resistance of the system demonstrates a similar trend to the power density the internal resistance was reduced with the increase of caffeine concentration caffeine and its intermediate such as xanthine could provide the electrons required for electricity generation due to their good electron donor properties 45 hence more electrons were received by the anode and stimulated the transfer rate of electrons from anode to cathode which could lower the internal resistance and contributed to higher power output the reduction of internal resistance was more obvious at c a2 and c a3 since most of the organic matter was consumed at the lower compartment of the bioreactor to reflect the effectiveness of ufcw mfc in the retrieval of energy coulombic efficiency ce was evaluated as shown in table 3 and fig 6 c the highest ce value was obtained at the smallest electrode spacing regardless of the concentration of caffeine the result was consistent with the previous study which could be due to the less competition of electrons at the upper part of the bioreactor 18 the anodes were positioned from the bottom part to the upper part of the bioreactor in the order of c a3 c a2 and c a1 the competition of electrons for the processes such as methanogenesis denitrification and the anode at the c a3 and c a2 was much higher than c a1 46 consequently more electrons were available to produce electricity in c a1 and thus contributed to the highest ce the effect of caffeine concentration on ce was revealed in fig 6 c the ce obtained in this study was 26 94 6 28 3 09 and 1 29 for phases i ii iii and iv respectively the ce shows a declined trend as the concentration of caffeine increased this could be mainly due to the increase in influent cod as ce was highly dependent on the cod removed martin et al 47 reported a similar trend where the ce decreased with the increase of organic loading rate the study indicated that too high organic loading could promote the growth of methanogenic microorganisms and lead to the decrease of ce obtained the increase of cod tends to decrease the ce as only certain microbes in the population are responsible for the generation of electricity 48 in addition caffeine could be converted to methane under anaerobic conditions through the methanogenesis process 6 since mixed cultures sludge was used for inoculation in this study it was expected that caffeine was partially utilized by the methanogens to produce methane hence the electrons available for the generation of electricity were reduced and subsequently decreased the ce as the caffeine concentration increased energy recovery from the wastewater in the ufcw mfc system was also assessed by calculating normalized energy recovery ner based on removal of substrates ners and the volume of wastewater treated nerv 49 both ners and nerv demonstrated a similar trend to the ce in terms of the effect of electrode spacing the ners and nerv were found to be the highest at the smallest electrode spacing of c a1 followed by c a2 and c a3 as shown in table 3 on the other hand the concentration of caffeine affected the ners and nerv differently fig 6 c shows the effect of caffeine concentration on ners and nerv ners exhibits the increase in the concentration of caffeine could decrease the performance of ners whereas nerv displays an inclined trend as the caffeine concentration increased ners was highly dependent on the influent cod as it was evaluated based on the amount of organic matter converted to the energy therefore ners decreased correspondingly to the increase of caffeine concentration since not all substrates degraded were associated with the production of energy nerv was assessed in terms of the treated volume of wastewater and not affected by the cod hence more electrons were available for energy generation as the concentration of caffeine increased and subsequently increased the nerv 4 conclusion this study has shown the capability of ufcw mfc in converting various concentrations of caffeine to electrons for electricity generation ufcw mfc successfully removed 98 of caffeine and achieved 51 of toxicity reduction the degradation pathway demonstrates the catabolism of caffeine to less toxic products the closed circuit performed about 5 better than the open circuit in terms of caffeine and cod removal in the anaerobic region this shows that integration of the mfc feature into cw could enhance the degradation of caffeine and intermediates in the anodic region supplementary aeration and macrophyte improved 100 and 9 of ammonium removal compared to bioreactor operated without aeration and plant respectively both supplementary aeration and macrophyte play an essential role in removing the excess ammonium ions produced during the caffeine catabolism in addition supplementary aeration was also required for the further degradation of unconsumed caffeine and its intermediates the role of the plant was not significantly contributed to the caffeine removal in this study which could be due to low hrt the highest voltage and maximum power density were observed at phase iv 552 9 mv and 185 75 mw m3 respectively which indicated caffeine could be used as a fuel for electricity generation in ufcw mfc declaration of competing interest the authors

13164,this paper presents a computational fluid dynamics cfd model of a pilot scale dissolved air flotation daf tank a multiphase mixture model was used to analyse the influence of bubble sizes on the formation of a stratified flow structure critical bubble diameter is defined as the size of the bubble that implies the equality of the bubble rising velocity and flow downward velocity in the separation zone sz the fact as to whether using air bubble sizes which are greater or less than the critical diameter value significantly affects the air content flow structure and the limit of the whitewater blanket inside the sz is assessed the study was carried out using two approaches namely mono and multi diameter the results obtained via the mono diameter approach proved to be closely in line with experimental data when air concentration in the sz had almost but not quite a constant value however it failed to predict the case of the progressive decrease in air below half of sz height a combined effect of bubbles with different rising speed was required to reproduce a smooth air profile curve as measured experimentally in this context a multi diameter approach is deemed to be a suitable method for reproducing the stratified structure in addition this approach offers the chance to study bubble size distribution inside the sz domain keywords cfd daf dissolved air flotation multiphase flow mixture model stratified flow water treatment 1 introduction dissolved air flotation daf is well known for its ability to eliminate low specific gravity particles such as algae e g cryptosporidium and giardia and to treat low turbidity raw water 1 the daf tank comprises two main parts separated by means of a baffle the contact zone cz and the separation zone sz part of the clarified water is recycled into the saturation equipment with the purpose of being saturated with air lately this recycled current has been depressurized in the contact zone by mean of injectors producing a cloud of microbubbles mb aggregates which are formed in the cz from the combination of mb and solid particles are separated from the main current in the sz due to their density difference further information about daf functioning can be found in 2 4 lundh et al 5 10 carried out a significant number of experiments using a pilot scale daf tank with the authors having collected the most complete detailed and reliable data about daf functioning although mb size was not measured lundh 7 observed the existence of stratified flow structure in certain operating conditions reporting that this phenomenon may have a crucial impact on daf performance therefore the role of air bubbles is not only limited to solid particle collection but also to modifying the flow structure inside the sz amato and wicks 11 reported successful duplication of the water treatment capacity of the plant studied according to this phenomenon this last statement reflecting the importance of understanding how and why the stratified structure is formed a typical mb diameter that can be found in daf application ranges between 10 and 150 μm 4 with mb size being one of the key parameters affecting daf performance 12 13 macro bubbles defined by rykaart and haarhoff 14 as greater than 150 μm should be avoided because their rising velocity is high enough to damage or even destroy bubble particle aggregates in addition residence time of these bubbles is too short to effectively collect solid particles on the other hand small bubbles may be dragged into the subnatant collection tube and deposited on the sand filter surface afterwards which means that the number of filter backwashing cycles will increase 2 net hydraulic loading hl is defined as total treated recycled flow rate divided by the projected area of the sz and formed the basis for conventional analysis of the daf separation zone 15 this simplified approach is based on a comparison of the rising velocity of the bubbles and hl all of the bubbles whose rising speed is greater than the hl are prone to leaving the sz domain and therefore the solid particles through the free surface despite the fact that experimental studies can provide reliable data for optimization of daf they are expensive and complex to conduct 8 10 16 an additional difficulty with pilot scale plants is the complexity involved in scaling the bubble diameter reliable in situ measurement of the most important parameters such as mixture velocity air concentration and mb size distribution are difficult to take due to the complexity of the experiment and multiphase system characteristics in this context computational fluid dynamics cfd emerges as an alternative to the traditional methods having been used to develop 17 and optimize 18 different equipment in the flotation process and found to be a very useful tool in order to predict hydraulic behaviour in water and wastewater treatment 19 dissolved air flotation involves a three phase multiphase flow however lundh 6 reported that for dilute suspended solid concentration 25 mg ss l in the incoming water flow structure was not affected by the existence of biological flocs therefore most cfd studies 11 20 24 have not taken the solid particles and aggregates into account amato and wicks 11 carried out cfd simulations in order to upgrade an existing daf design which involved constructing 2d and 3d models consisting of 335 000 hexahedral cells however the authors gave preference to the 2d model for its part the euler euler approach was used with bubble sizes ranging between 70 and 100 μm and the impact of length to height ratio of the inclined baffle and recirculating flow pattern on the sz were studied the limit of the whitewater blanket below which a major decrease in air concentration can be found is commonly known as the white water level wwl and in their studies amato and wicks 25 defined wwl as being with an air fraction limit of 10 4 authors pointed out that if wwl was lower than the position of the collection tubes the quality of the subnatant water could be put at risk and so it is therefore important to control this parameter bondelind et al 20 26 researched one and two phase flows in lundh s pilot daf tank using the euler lagrange approach reporting good reproduction of the flow field in the sz the prediction of the water velocity field in single phase simulations was in line with experimental results although a discrepancy between the air volume fraction predicted and experimental data was found in the case of two phase flow simulations authors carried out their studies in 2d and 3d domains concluding that the exclusion of a third dimension has a major impact on the prediction of cz hydraulic behaviour chen et al 21 researched the impact of microbubble diameters ranging from 30 to 70 μm on the hydraulic behaviour of the daf unit lundh s pilot tank was modelled as a 3d domain discretized using 705 410 cells whereby the authors simulated the flow for 1000 s approximately twice the mean hydraulic residence time modelling the free surface as a frictionless wall for their part euler euler and euler lagrange approaches were evaluated to ascertain which one would make a better prediction with the result of the study being that the euler euler approach gave a better prediction of experimental data finally the influence of mb size on sz hydraulics was evaluated with authors reporting that larger bubbles were conducive to the formation of a stratified flow rodrigues et al 22 also modelled lundh s pilot tank and studied the influence of 30 50 and 70 μm bubbles on the stratified flow structure using the approach proposed by chen et al 21 the 3d domain was discretized with 848 880 cells and simulated for two mean hydraulic residence times and two multiphase approaches were evaluated namely euler euler and mixture rodrigues et al 18 compared their simulation with the results obtained by chen et al 21 even though the recycle rate and in turn the air quantity is doubled in the case of chen the authors concluded that air concentration obtained using the mixture model was higher in comparison to the euler euler approach that modelling of the free surface as a degassing boundary condition was more realistic than the frictionless wall and that there was little difference in results when two different drag laws applied to bubble movement were used most authors 21 24 carried out transient simulations with sufficiently small timesteps in comparison to mean hydraulic residence time however transient simulations are very time consuming because long flow times are required to reach quasi steady conditions in which flow field variables remain almost constant over time for this reason other authors 20 27 carried out steady state simulations reporting acceptable agreement between the velocity field and experimental measurements dissolved air flotation is a complex multiphase system that requires many computational resources in order to be properly solved this work offers a novel concept and most importantly computationally affordable approaches that have been employed in the analysis of lundh s pilot daf tank in order to predict air concentration and flow structure inside the sz two approaches were used specifically mono and multi diameter the former considers one secondary phase with a unique bubble diameter while the latter takes into consideration several secondary phases each with a distinct diameter it was ascertained that the results obtained by steady state simulations were very similar to those obtained by sufficiently long flow time transient simulations additionally the solution obtained using the mixture model was assessed as being practically identical to that obtained using euler euler multiphase models a novel concept termed critical bubble diameter was defined as the bubble size that equals bubble rising velocity and hl with this diameter being used as a reference for selection of suitable bubble sizes for study purposes an analysis was performed to evaluate on the one hand the impact of bubble sizes above and below the critical bubble diameter on the position of the wwl and on the other the effect of bubbles on the flow structure and on the air profile curves using the mono diameter approach furthermore a new multi diameter approach was used to estimate the combined effect of different bubble diameters on the hydrodynamics of the sz and to calculate bubble size distribution the results obtained using the two approaches were compared to the experimental measurements taken by lundh 2 materials and methods lundh s pilot tank 10 was analysed by means of cfd simulations the whole separation system contained daf unit pre treatment process and recycled circuit although as the scope of this study was to analyse the daf unit the other system components were not included the main dimensions of the tank are described in fig 1 only half of the domain was simulated and lines l1 l2 and l3 which correspond to 0 65 1 05 and 1 35 m of the x coordinate can also be seen in the figure complete details of the tank geometry and configuration can be found in lundh s phd dissertation 6 or rodrigues et al 22 three different cases were analysed in this study see detailed information in table 1 and it was decided to retain lundh s nomenclature whereby the names of the cases were m18 m19 and m21 7 the main part of the study was carried out using the m19 and m21 cases although m18 was also researched the air flow rate and air fraction see table 1 were calculated based on the mean value of air concentration inside the cz ccz measured by lundh however it should be pointed out that lundh did not measure the diameter of the bubbles during his experiments and this parameter is of major importance when performing cfd simulations hence a range of diameters was researched in order to find which size would adjust better to the experimental data 2 1 mathematical modelling many authors 1 11 21 24 28 have used the euler euler approach 29 in order to predict flow behaviour in pilot and industrial daf systems reporting acceptable agreement with experimental data some of the research was carried out using the euler lagrange approach 20 21 however chen et al 21 pointed out that the euler euler approach showed an advantage in predicting air concentration in comparison to euler lagrange 30 other authors 22 27 31 have reported good results with the mixture model 32 two multiphase approaches were analysed in this study namely the euler euler and mixture models both models were found to provide very similar results simulation results can be found in appendix b and therefore it is the mixture model that is discussed in this section as it was used in the fundamental part of the study the mixture model is a simplified multiphase model based on the euler euler approach and assumes that all phases behave as a mixture solving only one set of momentum equations that for the mixture the slip of a dispersed phase relative to the continuous phase is calculated by balancing the drag and body forces resulting from density differences the underlying assumption is that of a local equilibrium in which the dispersed particles always move with their terminal velocity relative to the continuous phase this means that bubbles are accelerated to their terminal velocity within a short distance and a criterion for neglecting the acceleration is related to the relaxation time of a particle τ p according to the stokes regime this is given by 32 1 τ p ρ p d p 2 18 μ m for r e p 1 2 r e p ρ q v p q d p μ q where ρ q and ρ p are primary water and secondary air phase densities μ q is the primary phase dynamic viscosity v pq is the relative velocity and d p is the particle bubble diameter for particles with d p 120 μm the particle reynolds number will be smaller than unity see table 2 as all of the bubble diameters used in this study are smaller than 120 μm the assumption of local equilibrium was met with the continuity and momentum equations for the mixture model taking the following form 3 ρ m t ρ m v m 0 4 ρ m v m t ρ m v m v m p μ m v m v m t ρ m g k 1 n α k ρ k v dr k v dr k where v m k 1 n α k ρ k v k ρ m is the mass averaged velocity ρ m k 1 n α k ρ k is the mixture density μ m k 1 n α k μ k is the mixture viscosity α k is the volume fraction of phase k and n is the number of phases drift velocity v dr k v k v m is used to close the conservation equation and is related to relative or slip velocity v kq via the following equation 5 v dr k v pq k 1 n c k v kq where v kq is the velocity of phase k relative to phase q and c k α k ρ k ρ m is the mass fraction of phase k in accordance with 32 the form of the relative velocity is given by 6 v pq τ p ρ p ρ m ϝ drag ρ p a v t where a is the secondary phase acceleration v t is the turbulence contribution to the velocity and ϝ drag is the drag function several drag laws were analysed namely schiller naumann morsi alexander universal and clift 33 very little difference was found between the drag coefficients for bubbles with diameter between 40 and 120 μm schiller naumann is a general purpose drag law and is therefore the one used in this study while the drag function of the eq 6 is defined as follows ϝ drag 1 0 15re p 0 687 for re p 1000 the realizable k ε model was used to deal with turbulence with k ε turbulence models having been thoroughly used in daf system simulations 1 11 21 22 26 28 34 these models consist of two empirically based equations for kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε park et al 35 analysed different turbulent models in an industrial daf unit and confirmed that the realizable k ε model proved to make a better prediction in addition bondelind et al 20 have also used realizable k ε model to simulate lundh s daf tank as regards boundary conditions the pilot tank has a symmetry xy plane that passes through a 0 35 m value of the z axis therefore the symmetry condition was used to split the tank in two halves see fig 1 the air mass sink term proposed by ta 36 for the free surface was implemented via a user defined function recycled flow injectors with 5 mm internal diameter in the form of squares of equivalent area were modelled as a velocity inlet with the freshwater inlet being modelled as a velocity inlet with velocity value equal to 0 04 m s in the case of m18 and m19 and 0 06 m s in the case of m21 turbulent intensity was set to 5 for both inlets whereas clarified water outlet was modelled as a rectangular pipe the same as 22 26 with evenly distributed squares 20 squares per pipe and in which a pressure outlet condition was set a single phase solution within the multiphase framework but with zero air flow rate was previously calculated for each case and used as the initial solution for multiphase simulations the set of results presented and discussed in section 3 were obtained by steady state simulations although transient simulations were also carried out bondelind et al 20 put forward a theoretical argument that steady state simulations could be used in daf tank analysis although as far as the authors are concerned no practical demonstration has yet been published a comparison was made between the transient approach taken by other authors 21 22 and the steady state approach used in this study the former authors provided the results they obtained after 1000 s of simulation flow time which is equivalent to around two mean hydraulic residence mhr times in our transient simulations we reproduced their results at the aforementioned flow time but found that a quasi steady solution was not obtained at least not until a flow time equal to six mhr times was reached moreover the quasi steady solution obtained proved to be very similar from a qualitative and quantitative point of view to the solution obtained by steady state simulation the results and discussion of this benchmark study can be found in appendix a 2 2 mesh used for simulations firstly a mesh of 0 85 million cells was built similar to that done by other authors 21 22 this mesh was used to carry out transient simulations see appendix a although when refined it was found that the steady state solution changed while the number of cell elements increased therefore it was decided to perform a mesh independency test in order to determine the discretization error and obtain sufficiently fine mesh a procedure for estimating the discretization error based on richardson extrapolation was proposed by celik et al 37 currently this is the most practical method available for estimation of numerical uncertainties three meshes with high quality hexahedral elements a mesh example can be seen in fig 2 were refined systematically starting from a coarse mesh which contained 2 8 million elements a refinement factor of around 1 25 was used in order to generate medium size and fine size meshes resulting in medium and fine meshes with 5 7 and 10 7 million elements being created in order to perform mesh analysis it is necessary to select a flow variable φ which is a key parameter for the study in question in this study the volume weighted average of air fraction in the whole tank was chosen the grid convergence index or gci represents an upper limit of the discretization error and is calculated from the estimated relative error multiplied by the safety factor 1 25 for three mesh study see 37 the euler euler approach was used to analyse the m18 case with 67 μm bubbles in a steady state simulation in order to secure a small iterative error r air eq 7 was maintained below 10 5 in the simulations with the three meshes calculated gci for the fine mesh was equal to 1 1 although simulating a ten million cell mesh proved unpractical due to the high computational burden on the other hand the use of coarse mesh may have significantly affected the accuracy of the results hence in this study the 5 7 million mesh was used in order not to lose accuracy and not to dramatically increase calculation time the value of gcimedium was equal to 4 7 and this uncertainty value was therefore assumed in the results in this study it has been shown that the number of elements required for a mesh independent solution is considerably higher than that employed by other authors in literature hence it is recommended that a mesh independence analysis be performed in order to quantify the discretization error in daf tank studies 2 3 numerical resolution of the mathematical model the mathematical model was solved using the finite volume method fvm all of the terms of the partial differential equations were discretized using second order schemes except for the convective term of the volume fraction equation that was discretized using a first order upwind scheme pressure velocity and volume fraction of the phases were solved in a coupled way with commercial ansys fluent 2020r1 software having been used to solve the previously proposed mathematical model all the simulations were performed in parallel mode with 2 3 ghz 64 cpus on a linux server intel xeon gold 5218 256 gb ram with average time required to perform a steady state simulation using the mixture model being around 24 h using the mono diameter approach and 48 120 h in the case of the multi diameter approach depending on the number of secondary phases the convergence criteria were carefully analysed with continuity velocity and turbulence residuals being maintained at values below 10 5 except for air fraction whose residual was slightly higher in order to accept the solution all the flow variables had to reach a stable value and in steady state simulations one additional criterion was imposed in order to control air fraction convergence 7 r air abs m n m n np m n where m n is the volume weighted average of air fraction n is the current iteration and np is the number of iterations to be considered in this case np was equal to 50 r air was maintained below 10 5 for mono diameter analysis and below 10 4 for multi diameter analysis in the case of the latter this criterion was imposed for every secondary phase and by applying this rule we ensured that all simulations had a very low iterative error 2 4 bubble size critical diameter concept if realistic cfd results were to be obtained and used for design and operation it would be necessary to know the bubble size distribution bsd that exists in the daf tank analysed the problem is that bubble size is difficult to measure in existing systems or to predict in the systems that are to be designed lundh did not measure bubble diameter and for this reason the cfd studies that were carried out on his pilot plant used different bubble sizes for their part bondelind et al 20 used 40 80 and 120 μm chen et al 21 used 30 40 50 60 and 70 μm rodrigues et al 22 used 30 50 and 70 μm and deng et al 24 used 40 80 and 120 μm the flow structures obtained in previous cfd studies of the lundh pilot plant were especially dependent on bubble diameter and so for this reason other authors emmanouil et al 28 have also analysed the effect of the different bubble diameters in a different daf system in order to determine suitable bubble sizes for the cfd analysis of the present study the water velocity vectors and air content profile curves reported by lundh et al 7 were analysed together fig 3a shows the contour of air content and water velocity plotted as cones that were recreated from lundh s data see also fig 5a it should be pointed out that during lundh s experiments air profiles and water velocity vectors were measured with several months difference 6 meaning that there may be a discrepancy between air concentration and velocity vector fields nevertheless this difference is assumed not to be important and the combined contour air profile vectors provides reliable information for analytical purposes fig 3a shows two clearly identified flow structures in the upper part the stratified flow is represented by a horizontal flow rich with bubbles which is moving in the direction of the far end wall in the lower part of the sz air content is lower and the flow is moving vertically in the direction of the outlet pipe forming a plug flow like structure this vertical flow drags air bubbles up to the level of the outlet with the wwl being located at that height around 0 1 m as a conclusion it can be said that the wwl does not necessarily have to divide the stratified flow from the plug flow structures in order to reproduce the structure reported by lundh some of the bubbles must be dragged by the plug flow in which case their rising speed vb will be lower than the downward velocity of the vertical flow vs same as hl consequently critical diameter dc is defined as the bubble size where vb is equal to vs it should be noted that vb is obtained as a result of buoyancy and the drag force equilibrium see the simplified scheme in fig 3b from a pragmatic point of view stokes s law was used to calculate the dc although it should be pointed out that this is an approximate value of the critical diameter because turbulence contribution was not included however as the turbulence level in the lower part of the sz is low there should be no major change in diameter in cases m18 hl 11 3 m h and m19 hl 11 8 m h bubble dc is around 77 μm see table 2 four different bubble sizes were selected for the analysis in the course of which critical diameter and sizes above and below this were researched namely 57 67 and 87 μm in case m21 hl 17 7 m h critical diameter was 95 μm and sizes selected for the analysis were 85 90 95 and 100 μm with the aid of cfd simulations it was noted that using air bubble sizes greater or less than dc significantly affects the air content flow structure and wwl position inside the sz see table 3 in the results and discussion section it is expected that all bubble sizes greater than dc will tend to form a layer of air closer to the free surface while bubbles that are lower than dc will fill the sz domain up to the level of the outlet pipe finally it should be pointed out that mechanisms involving any change in size of bubbles are not implemented in this study information exists in literature about the coalescence and break up phenomenon in flotation columns 38 41 however the bubble diameter used in the flotation column around 1 mm is considerably larger than microbubbles in the daf and the use of these models in dissolved air flotation needs to be properly validated rodrigues et al 42 researched into lundh s pilot tank using a population balance model with coalescence and break up models that were validated in flotation columns obtaining little agreement between simulation results and experimental data 2 5 multi diameter approach in this section a new approach to analysing hydraulic behaviour of the separation zone is presented a wide range of bubble sizes can be found in daf tanks and modelling of the continuous bsd remains a challenging process however instead of directly introducing the continuous bsd and mechanisms that affect distribution several secondary phases are included in the mixture model each individual phase having its own distinct diameter the critical diameter concept is used to select representative bubble diameters whereby 82 and 87 μm diameters were selected for the m19 case analysis as bubble sizes above dc and 57 μm as the size below dc moreover 77 μm was added to see the effect of the bubbles with the size being very close to the critical diameter this approach not only permits different bubble dynamics to be taken into account but also the computational effort is not prohibitively costly the key advantage of this approach is that interactions between several air phases and the carrier phase can be analysed and it also allows the sauter diameter of the bubbles to be calculated throughout the daf tank computational cost is relatively low in comparison to the euler euler approach although the maximum number of secondary phases remains a constraint on the one hand computational cost is increasing and on the other convergence difficulty rises with the addition of every secondary phase simulations with multiple secondary phases have already been carried out by bondelind et al 20 and emmanouil et al 28 however these authors employed a euler lagrange approach in simplified 2d models and did not conduct an in depth analysis of the effect of the combination of the three secondary phases on sz hydraulics moreover the euler lagrange approach is limited by the fact that bubble size distribution cannot be obtained directly 3 results and discussion in this section the results of lundh s pilot tank simulations are presented in the course of which the influence of microbubble diameter mb on the hydraulics of the separation zone was studied additionally the importance of the critical diameter on the bubble s presence in the domain is also analysed and finally the multi diameter approach is used to predict air distribution in the stratified flow structure the cfd results obtained were compared to air concentration profiles and water velocity vectors contours that were measured by lundh these magnitudes are the most representative and were also used to validate cfd results by other authors 20 22 26 31 3 1 analysis of mono diameter bubbles on the hydraulic behaviour of the separation zone the influence of bubble diameter on the flow pattern is analysed in the case of m19 first see table 1 the results were plotted in a similar way to make the comparison between lundh s experimental data figs 3a and 5a and cfd simulations easier in his work 6 lundh warned that the velocity vector module measured might contain a major error due to the intrinsic difficulty of using acoustic doppler velocimetry adv in this complex multiphase flow for this reason only the maximum velocity value is shown in the images simulations carried out with 57 and 67 μm diameter showed a break through like pattern inside the sz see fig 4 although this phenomenon was not observed in lundh s experiments see fig 5a after passing beyond the baffle wall water current then moves in the direction of the outlet pipe however following analysis of the other xy planes it was observed that further away from the air injection device the effect of the break through like pattern was less pronounced flow behaviour is different in the case of 87 μm diameter bubbles this mb size is greater than critical diameter 77 μm and as a result most of the air escapes across the degassing condition and wwl is located above the tip of the baffle see fig 4d density is higher below the wwl whereby the flow current filled with bubbles cannot penetrate deeper into the sz consequently the flow is forced to move towards the opposite wall additionally higher water velocity values close to the free surface were observed for 87 μm diameter bubbles similar to lundh s fig 5a although air concentration was not well predicted finally the 77 μm is a very sensitive diameter and the flow develops behaviour somewhere between 67 and 87 μm air distribution along lines l1 l2 and l3 can be seen in figs 5b and 6a b and all the simulations with mono sized bubbles predicted air concentration around 4 ml l above the wwl this fact is represented by almost vertical shape curves in the figure while in contrast below wwl air concentration drastically falls to values close to zero the results of bondelind et al 26 for 80 μm bubbles were included for comparison in figs 5b and 6a b in which it can be observed that the air quantity predicted using the euler lagrange approach is considerably lower than experimental data and that predicted using the euler euler approach it was also observed that bubble diameter had a major effect on the position of the wwl and as a result the total quantity of air in the sz rising velocity of the bubbles with 57 67 and 77 μm diameter was lower than hl see table 2 and as a result wwl penetrates deeper into the tank up to outlet pipe level located 10 cm above the ground the results obtained from the simulations with mb diameter of 57 μm see figs 5b and 6a b showed acceptable results of between 60 and 120 cm in comparison to experimental data 7 although it was not possible to reproduce the gradual reduction in air content below 60 cm with mono diameter bubbles case m21 was studied in accordance with a mono diameter approach whereby the flow rate was increased by 50 in terms of m19 as a result obtaining hl equal to 17 7 m h see m21 in table 1 four bubble sizes were selected for the analysis including critical diameter which was around 95 μm the major changes in wwl and air concentration would be expected to be seen in the size range between 90 and 100 μm the air contour along with the velocity vector in the case of m21 can be seen in fig 7 the clear difference should be pointed out between the behaviour of the air bubbles whose size was less than critical diameter fig 7a b and greater than critical value fig 7d mbs with 85 and 90 μm diameter occupied almost the whole separation zone to outlet pipe level in addition the main water current moved in the direction of the far end wall in the upper part and was then deflected back to the baffle in the lower part the same pattern was also observed on the other xy planes indicating that the effect of the third dimension is less pronounced than in the case of m19 similar behaviour was reported by lundh 7 as stratified flow it is worth noting that qualitatively 90 μm bubbles fig 7b showed very similar air and velocity fields in comparison to experimental data see fig 3a while in the case of the 100 μm bubble fig 7b behaviour was completely different in comparison to 85 and 90 although it was similar to 87 μm bubbles in the case of m19 fig 4d the air phase was concentrated in the upper part and most of the bubbles were not capable of passing to the lower part due to high density difference in the case of 95 and 100 μm mbs the plug flow like pattern was observed below the wwl air concentration profiles plotted along lines l2 and l3 can be seen in fig 6c d the results showed that in the case of 85 and 90 μm bubbles wwl was positioned around 10 cm above the bottom of the tank at outlet pipe level while in that of 100 μm bubbles wwl was located at the height of 87 cm above the ground air concentration profiles for 90 μm bubbles measured on lines l2 and l3 proved to be more in line with experimental data in comparison to 100 μm it is likely that mean bubble diameter in lundh s experiment was lower than 95 μm because the position of the wwl as observed in the experiment was located around outlet pipe level see fig 6c d a summary of the mono diameter simulations can be seen in table 3 it is worth noting that there was a major difference in volume weighted average of air concentration between the lowest and highest bubble diameter value researched in each case air concentration decreased to a major extent when mb diameter was greater than critical diameter in addition the position of the wwl was also especially sensitive to critical diameter meaning that small changes in hl might significantly affect the wwl in cfd simulations this fact can be observed in table 3 when comparing values of the wwl position of 77 μm bubbles in m18 and m19 simulation results in the case of m18 the hl is slightly lower and therefore the wwl position is slightly higher 0 3 m in comparison to m19 0 14 m finally it should be added that m18 contours were not included in this paper however the conclusions drawn in the case of m18 were very similar as for m19 and only air phase related values can be seen in table 3 air eliminated by means of the mass sink term divided by air entering through the recycled inlets degassing air in table 3 was compared to air bubble removal efficiency used in conventional daf designs vb vs a discrepancy was found in the case of mb diameters that were lower than critical which could be explained by the fact that conventional theory only takes into account air leaving above the sz domain and that the cfd also considers air leaving above the cz 3 2 multi diameter analysis in the previous section it was seen that single diameter bubbles created even distribution of air inside the sz up to outlet level namely around 4 ml l of air concentration in the case of m19 and m21 nevertheless experimental results obtained from the m19 case showed a gradual decrease in air concentration below 60 cm of tank height although this behaviour was not possible to predict with single diameter bubbles in the case of m21 the experiments did not detect any progressive decay of air concentration and so the prediction made using the mono diameter was sufficient a simulation with operating conditions as in the m19 case was carried out using the multi diameter approach as mentioned in section 2 5 four secondary phases were included with 57 77 82 and 87 μm bubble diameters the same total quantity of air as in the mono diameter approach was introduced at the recycled velocity inlet and the air was evenly distributed across the four phases stratified flow structure was obtained by combining bubbles with different rising velocities see fig 8 air concentration was higher in the upper part of the sz because mb of a greater size occupied the region closer to the free surface while smaller mbs filled the whole sz domain up to outlet pipe level see fig 10a for its part air contour evidenced different concentrations that were reduced as the y coordinate decreased especially in the region of the l2 and l3 lines regarding velocity vectors higher velocities were observed close to the free surface on the upper part the main current moved from the cz to sz in the direction of the opposite wall and the current was then deflected downward however a small proportion of the main flow formed a break through like pattern in the region closer to the separation baffle finally the plug flow structure formed in the lower part higher velocities on the upper part and plug flow on the lower part are a phenomenon reported by lundh see fig 5a although a break through like pattern and higher velocities at the top were also observed in mono diameter results in the case of 57 and 87 μm see fig 4a and d meaning that the multi diameter simulation maintains the characteristics of the mono diameter ones following analysis of the other xy planes it was observed that the break through like pattern is less pronounced further away from the injector and as a result the plug flow like structure extends through the whole length of the separation zone below the tip of the baffle air content profiles measured on lines l1 l2 and l3 can be seen in fig 9a c air concentration was better predicted compared to experimental results in the region of the l2 and l3 lines because of lower water velocity in comparison to mono diameter simulation of 57 and 87 μm mbs the results obtained using the multi diameter simulation were able to predict a progressive reduction in air content below 0 6 m of the y coordinate nevertheless air concentration predicted in the region from 0 6 to 1 2 m was lower than values reported by lundh finally there was less agreement with experimental data in the case of the l1 region where the short circuit pattern was detected fig 10 shows air distribution inside the sz while a histogram of air diameter distribution along line l2 can be seen in fig 10a as rising velocity of 57 μm bubbles was well below hl their presence could be found in the whole separation zone above the outlet pipe conversely in the case of 87 μm bubbles rising velocity was higher than hl as a result their position was limited to a 30 cm high layer located below the water surface see similar behaviour in mono diameter simulations in figs 4d and 7d intermediate sizes 77 and 82 μm were distributed in different heights as a function of their rising speed the sauter diameter contour was created by combining air distribution of the four secondary phases see fig 10b this contour indicates that most of the large bubble diameters were concentrated on the top layer although a small part of the 82 and 87 μm bubbles were dragged deeper into the sz domain due to the break through current as a result the sauter diameter value increased in the region of the l1 line although conversely uniform decay of the bubble sauter diameter was observed closer to the opposite wall ultimately the results showed that air distribution contains characteristics of the four secondary phases this observation was also reported by bondelind 20 finally in order to assess the sensitivity of the model in terms of air distribution a couple of additional studies were undertaken such as changing air concentration of the highest and lowest bubble diameters this means that the original air distribution see fig 9a c which comprised evenly distributed air concentrations was modified the volume fraction of 87 μm air bubbles was doubled and total air quantity at the recycled inlet was therefore increased by 25 in comparison to the air concentration value measured by lundh an equivalent experiment was conducted using the 57 μm fraction where only the 57 μm fraction was modified and the rest remained equal when 87 μm air fraction was increased the tendency was to move the upper part between 0 8 and 1 2 cm of the curve to the right i e by increasing air concentration only on the top most layer see fig 11 in contrast when the 57 μm fraction was increased all of the air profile was displaced to the right meaning that total presence of air increased in the domain in summary these studies showed that it is possible to modify the shape of the air profile obtained by varying air fraction distribution and bubble diameter 4 conclusions the cfd model of lundh s pilot tank was analysed using mono and multi diameter approaches in the course of which it was ascertained that the solution obtained via a steady state simulation was very similar to that obtained by sufficiently long flow time transient simulations additionally it was confirmed that the multiphase mixture model offered almost identical results to the euler euler model and is suitable for carrying out daf tank simulations the critical diameter dc concept was introduced and demonstrated that it is a useful tool for daf cfd studies for all of the case studies examined the results obtained from the mono diameter simulations showed two clearly discernible types of behaviour depending on whether the bubble diameter was greater or less than dc in simulations where the selected size was greater than dc bubbles would be concentrated in the upper part of the sz as a result the density of the layer located closer to the free surface was lower forcing the water current to move in the direction of the far end wall water velocity vectors were similar to experimental results although air profile curve was not predicted in the case of simulations in which the bubble size was less than dc the whole sz was filled with air up to outlet pipe level in all mono diameter simulations air profile plots were shown as almost vertical curves up to white water level wwl the experimental results in which lundh obtained a smooth air profile curve with progressive decrease below 60 cm of sz height m19 case were not possible to reproduce using the mono diameter approach nevertheless the approximately uniform air distribution up to outlet pipe level predicted in the case of m21 was closely in line with experimental data in order to reproduce a smooth air profile curve the combined effect of different bubble sizes close to the critical diameter value proved necessary the multi diameter approach is proposed as an appropriate method for predicting the gradual reduction of air reported by lundh in the case of m19 a stratified flow structure was reproduced although a small short circuit like pattern was formed close to the baffle the results showed that air bubbles were distributed in layers as a function of their rising speed generating an air profile curve very similar to the curve reported by lundh for its part prediction considerably improved for tank height lower than 60 cm although in contrast prediction of air concentration worsened closer to the free surface additionally this approach provided the chance to analyse air distribution and calculate the mean values of the bubble diameter as a function of tank height sensitivity of the model to changes in air distribution in the inlet was evaluated its being observed that increasing the quantity of the air phase of the highest diameter affected only the upper layer of the sz meanwhile an increase in the fraction of the lowest diameter displaced the air profile curve to the right meaning that air concentration increased in the whole sz up to outlet level this cfd study was conducted on a pilot daf tank although the approaches and ideas proposed in this study are equally valid for a full scale tank analysis they can be used by designers in the preliminary design of the sz in cases where bubble sizes are not known in addition cfd modellers in the wastewater field can also benefit from them to improve prediction of their simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

appendix a benchmark using the studies by chen et al and rodrigues et al chen et al 21 carried out simulations in lundh s daf tank using 0 01 s timesteps and reported a converged solution for a flow time of 1000 s which is approximately two mean hydraulic residence times mhr 490 s additionally rodrigues et al 22 and deng et al 24 also obtained their results simulating up to a flow time of 1000 s our intention was to reproduce the studies by chen and rodrigues and carry out transient simulations of m18 and m19 cases using the euler euler approach the domain was discretized with 0 85 million cells which is a mesh similar in size to that used by chen and rodrigues chen reported close agreement with experimental data for 50 and 60 μm bubble sizes and so 50 μm diameter bubbles were therefore selected to analyse the m18 and m19 cases case study m19 was simulated in accordance with the methodology proposed by chen et al 21 the boundary conditions were the same as those reported by the authors with the most significant being that the water surface was modelled as a frictionless wall the air profile on line l2 obtained for different flow times can be seen in fig a1 a while air profile values for 1000 s were taken from chen and included in the figure the results showed that if the simulation was stopped at 1000 s the air profile obtained would be closely in line with experimental data provided by lundh et al 7 however if the simulation was continued up to 3000 s the air concentration curve would take the form of an almost vertical line this indicating that the air phase tends to be evenly distributed throughout the whole sz above the outlet pipe with concentration value around 4 ml l ultimately it was observed that the volume weighted average of air fraction in 3000 s was increased by 51 in comparison to 1000 s therefore two mhr times proved not to be enough to obtain a stable solution for the m19 case study it is worth mentioning that in this study a quasi steady solution was not possible to obtain due to convergence difficulties that appeared after 3000 s since the free surface was modelled as a frictionless wall an accumulation of air appeared adjacent to the free surface that prevented the simulation from converging fig a1 air concentration profile on line l2 for case m19 a and for case m18 b for different flow times the results taken from chen et al 21 and rodrigues et al 22 and lundh et al 7 were added to the plot fig a1 case study m18 was simulated using the methodology proposed by rodrigues et al 22 the air concentration profile obtained on line l2 for 600 1000 3000 and 10 000 s is depicted in fig a1 b together with the result presented by rodrigues et al 18 at 1000 s twice the mhr time at this flow time both simulation results were very similar and predicted air concentration values below 0 6 m of tank height that were closely in line with the results obtained by lundh et al 7 however if the simulation were continued for another four mhr times until 3000 s the air profile curve would show an approximately constant value around 2 ml l of air concentration above the outlet pipe the average concentration in the tank being increased by 31 in comparison to 1000 s therefore as in the case of m19 it was concluded that carrying out a transient simulation for two mhr times was also not sufficient for the purpose of reaching a quasi steady solution extending the simulation from 3000 s to 10 000 s produced only slight changes at the upper and lower ends of the air profile curve moreover average air concentration in the tank increased asymptotically only by 3 therefore as speculated by bondelind et al 20 the results showed a flow structure that was time dependent at the beginning of the simulation although when the general flow pattern was established the solution became almost independent of time hence the solution for 10 000 s can be assumed to be the quasi steady solution while the solution for 3000 s is so close to the latter that it can be considered a good approximation finally the most important finding in this benchmark was that steady state simulation provided a solution that was very similar to the quasi steady solution see fig a1 b albeit taking only a fraction of the computation time the average air concentration in the tank obtained via steady state simulation was only 1 higher than that calculated via transient simulation for 10 000 s therefore carrying out steady state simulations proved to be a suitable approach for the purpose of analysing daf systems appendix b comparison between euler euler and mixture models the m18 and m19 cases were analysed using two multiphase models namely the euler euler and mixture models it should be pointed out that in order to compare both models the same two forces were included drag and buoyancy in the euler euler approach four different bubble diameters 57 67 77 and 87 μm were used in the study air contours along with the water velocity vectors can be found in fig b1 simulations have evidenced very similar distribution of the air phase and velocity vector fields from the qualitative point of view in the case of both models the major changes were observed in the contours of critical diameter bubbles see fig b1 c and g because the flow structure was very sensitive to this bubble size it is worth mentioning that the time and computational resource required to perform simulation via the mixture approach were considerably lower in comparison to the euler euler approach air contours for m18 were not included because the results were also very similar table b1 air distribution and wwl position for different mb sizes in the case of euler euler eu eu and mixture approaches aaf is the volume

table b1 reinforces the conclusions reached for fig b1 volume weighted average of air fraction was calculated for different bubble diameters inside the daf tank domain providing practically identical values in the case of both models additionally wwl was determined and the results were very similar and it was concluded that both models were equally valid for the purpose of performing daf tank

13164,this paper presents a computational fluid dynamics cfd model of a pilot scale dissolved air flotation daf tank a multiphase mixture model was used to analyse the influence of bubble sizes on the formation of a stratified flow structure critical bubble diameter is defined as the size of the bubble that implies the equality of the bubble rising velocity and flow downward velocity in the separation zone sz the fact as to whether using air bubble sizes which are greater or less than the critical diameter value significantly affects the air content flow structure and the limit of the whitewater blanket inside the sz is assessed the study was carried out using two approaches namely mono and multi diameter the results obtained via the mono diameter approach proved to be closely in line with experimental data when air concentration in the sz had almost but not quite a constant value however it failed to predict the case of the progressive decrease in air below half of sz height a combined effect of bubbles with different rising speed was required to reproduce a smooth air profile curve as measured experimentally in this context a multi diameter approach is deemed to be a suitable method for reproducing the stratified structure in addition this approach offers the chance to study bubble size distribution inside the sz domain keywords cfd daf dissolved air flotation multiphase flow mixture model stratified flow water treatment 1 introduction dissolved air flotation daf is well known for its ability to eliminate low specific gravity particles such as algae e g cryptosporidium and giardia and to treat low turbidity raw water 1 the daf tank comprises two main parts separated by means of a baffle the contact zone cz and the separation zone sz part of the clarified water is recycled into the saturation equipment with the purpose of being saturated with air lately this recycled current has been depressurized in the contact zone by mean of injectors producing a cloud of microbubbles mb aggregates which are formed in the cz from the combination of mb and solid particles are separated from the main current in the sz due to their density difference further information about daf functioning can be found in 2 4 lundh et al 5 10 carried out a significant number of experiments using a pilot scale daf tank with the authors having collected the most complete detailed and reliable data about daf functioning although mb size was not measured lundh 7 observed the existence of stratified flow structure in certain operating conditions reporting that this phenomenon may have a crucial impact on daf performance therefore the role of air bubbles is not only limited to solid particle collection but also to modifying the flow structure inside the sz amato and wicks 11 reported successful duplication of the water treatment capacity of the plant studied according to this phenomenon this last statement reflecting the importance of understanding how and why the stratified structure is formed a typical mb diameter that can be found in daf application ranges between 10 and 150 μm 4 with mb size being one of the key parameters affecting daf performance 12 13 macro bubbles defined by rykaart and haarhoff 14 as greater than 150 μm should be avoided because their rising velocity is high enough to damage or even destroy bubble particle aggregates in addition residence time of these bubbles is too short to effectively collect solid particles on the other hand small bubbles may be dragged into the subnatant collection tube and deposited on the sand filter surface afterwards which means that the number of filter backwashing cycles will increase 2 net hydraulic loading hl is defined as total treated recycled flow rate divided by the projected area of the sz and formed the basis for conventional analysis of the daf separation zone 15 this simplified approach is based on a comparison of the rising velocity of the bubbles and hl all of the bubbles whose rising speed is greater than the hl are prone to leaving the sz domain and therefore the solid particles through the free surface despite the fact that experimental studies can provide reliable data for optimization of daf they are expensive and complex to conduct 8 10 16 an additional difficulty with pilot scale plants is the complexity involved in scaling the bubble diameter reliable in situ measurement of the most important parameters such as mixture velocity air concentration and mb size distribution are difficult to take due to the complexity of the experiment and multiphase system characteristics in this context computational fluid dynamics cfd emerges as an alternative to the traditional methods having been used to develop 17 and optimize 18 different equipment in the flotation process and found to be a very useful tool in order to predict hydraulic behaviour in water and wastewater treatment 19 dissolved air flotation involves a three phase multiphase flow however lundh 6 reported that for dilute suspended solid concentration 25 mg ss l in the incoming water flow structure was not affected by the existence of biological flocs therefore most cfd studies 11 20 24 have not taken the solid particles and aggregates into account amato and wicks 11 carried out cfd simulations in order to upgrade an existing daf design which involved constructing 2d and 3d models consisting of 335 000 hexahedral cells however the authors gave preference to the 2d model for its part the euler euler approach was used with bubble sizes ranging between 70 and 100 μm and the impact of length to height ratio of the inclined baffle and recirculating flow pattern on the sz were studied the limit of the whitewater blanket below which a major decrease in air concentration can be found is commonly known as the white water level wwl and in their studies amato and wicks 25 defined wwl as being with an air fraction limit of 10 4 authors pointed out that if wwl was lower than the position of the collection tubes the quality of the subnatant water could be put at risk and so it is therefore important to control this parameter bondelind et al 20 26 researched one and two phase flows in lundh s pilot daf tank using the euler lagrange approach reporting good reproduction of the flow field in the sz the prediction of the water velocity field in single phase simulations was in line with experimental results although a discrepancy between the air volume fraction predicted and experimental data was found in the case of two phase flow simulations authors carried out their studies in 2d and 3d domains concluding that the exclusion of a third dimension has a major impact on the prediction of cz hydraulic behaviour chen et al 21 researched the impact of microbubble diameters ranging from 30 to 70 μm on the hydraulic behaviour of the daf unit lundh s pilot tank was modelled as a 3d domain discretized using 705 410 cells whereby the authors simulated the flow for 1000 s approximately twice the mean hydraulic residence time modelling the free surface as a frictionless wall for their part euler euler and euler lagrange approaches were evaluated to ascertain which one would make a better prediction with the result of the study being that the euler euler approach gave a better prediction of experimental data finally the influence of mb size on sz hydraulics was evaluated with authors reporting that larger bubbles were conducive to the formation of a stratified flow rodrigues et al 22 also modelled lundh s pilot tank and studied the influence of 30 50 and 70 μm bubbles on the stratified flow structure using the approach proposed by chen et al 21 the 3d domain was discretized with 848 880 cells and simulated for two mean hydraulic residence times and two multiphase approaches were evaluated namely euler euler and mixture rodrigues et al 18 compared their simulation with the results obtained by chen et al 21 even though the recycle rate and in turn the air quantity is doubled in the case of chen the authors concluded that air concentration obtained using the mixture model was higher in comparison to the euler euler approach that modelling of the free surface as a degassing boundary condition was more realistic than the frictionless wall and that there was little difference in results when two different drag laws applied to bubble movement were used most authors 21 24 carried out transient simulations with sufficiently small timesteps in comparison to mean hydraulic residence time however transient simulations are very time consuming because long flow times are required to reach quasi steady conditions in which flow field variables remain almost constant over time for this reason other authors 20 27 carried out steady state simulations reporting acceptable agreement between the velocity field and experimental measurements dissolved air flotation is a complex multiphase system that requires many computational resources in order to be properly solved this work offers a novel concept and most importantly computationally affordable approaches that have been employed in the analysis of lundh s pilot daf tank in order to predict air concentration and flow structure inside the sz two approaches were used specifically mono and multi diameter the former considers one secondary phase with a unique bubble diameter while the latter takes into consideration several secondary phases each with a distinct diameter it was ascertained that the results obtained by steady state simulations were very similar to those obtained by sufficiently long flow time transient simulations additionally the solution obtained using the mixture model was assessed as being practically identical to that obtained using euler euler multiphase models a novel concept termed critical bubble diameter was defined as the bubble size that equals bubble rising velocity and hl with this diameter being used as a reference for selection of suitable bubble sizes for study purposes an analysis was performed to evaluate on the one hand the impact of bubble sizes above and below the critical bubble diameter on the position of the wwl and on the other the effect of bubbles on the flow structure and on the air profile curves using the mono diameter approach furthermore a new multi diameter approach was used to estimate the combined effect of different bubble diameters on the hydrodynamics of the sz and to calculate bubble size distribution the results obtained using the two approaches were compared to the experimental measurements taken by lundh 2 materials and methods lundh s pilot tank 10 was analysed by means of cfd simulations the whole separation system contained daf unit pre treatment process and recycled circuit although as the scope of this study was to analyse the daf unit the other system components were not included the main dimensions of the tank are described in fig 1 only half of the domain was simulated and lines l1 l2 and l3 which correspond to 0 65 1 05 and 1 35 m of the x coordinate can also be seen in the figure complete details of the tank geometry and configuration can be found in lundh s phd dissertation 6 or rodrigues et al 22 three different cases were analysed in this study see detailed information in table 1 and it was decided to retain lundh s nomenclature whereby the names of the cases were m18 m19 and m21 7 the main part of the study was carried out using the m19 and m21 cases although m18 was also researched the air flow rate and air fraction see table 1 were calculated based on the mean value of air concentration inside the cz ccz measured by lundh however it should be pointed out that lundh did not measure the diameter of the bubbles during his experiments and this parameter is of major importance when performing cfd simulations hence a range of diameters was researched in order to find which size would adjust better to the experimental data 2 1 mathematical modelling many authors 1 11 21 24 28 have used the euler euler approach 29 in order to predict flow behaviour in pilot and industrial daf systems reporting acceptable agreement with experimental data some of the research was carried out using the euler lagrange approach 20 21 however chen et al 21 pointed out that the euler euler approach showed an advantage in predicting air concentration in comparison to euler lagrange 30 other authors 22 27 31 have reported good results with the mixture model 32 two multiphase approaches were analysed in this study namely the euler euler and mixture models both models were found to provide very similar results simulation results can be found in appendix b and therefore it is the mixture model that is discussed in this section as it was used in the fundamental part of the study the mixture model is a simplified multiphase model based on the euler euler approach and assumes that all phases behave as a mixture solving only one set of momentum equations that for the mixture the slip of a dispersed phase relative to the continuous phase is calculated by balancing the drag and body forces resulting from density differences the underlying assumption is that of a local equilibrium in which the dispersed particles always move with their terminal velocity relative to the continuous phase this means that bubbles are accelerated to their terminal velocity within a short distance and a criterion for neglecting the acceleration is related to the relaxation time of a particle τ p according to the stokes regime this is given by 32 1 τ p ρ p d p 2 18 μ m for r e p 1 2 r e p ρ q v p q d p μ q where ρ q and ρ p are primary water and secondary air phase densities μ q is the primary phase dynamic viscosity v pq is the relative velocity and d p is the particle bubble diameter for particles with d p 120 μm the particle reynolds number will be smaller than unity see table 2 as all of the bubble diameters used in this study are smaller than 120 μm the assumption of local equilibrium was met with the continuity and momentum equations for the mixture model taking the following form 3 ρ m t ρ m v m 0 4 ρ m v m t ρ m v m v m p μ

laws were analysed namely schiller naumann morsi alexander universal and clift 33 very little difference was found between the drag coefficients for bubbles with diameter between 40 and 120 μm schiller naumann is a general purpose drag law and is therefore the one used in this study while the drag function of the eq 6 is defined as follows ϝ drag 1 0 15re p 0 687 for re p 1000 the realizable k ε model was used to deal with turbulence with k ε turbulence models having been thoroughly used in daf system simulations 1 11 21 22 26 28 34 these models consist of two empirically based equations for kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε park et al 35 analysed different turbulent models in an industrial daf unit and confirmed that the realizable k ε model proved to make a better prediction in addition bondelind et al 20 have also used realizable k ε model to simulate lundh s daf tank as regards boundary conditions the pilot tank has a symmetry xy plane that passes through a 0 35 m value of the z axis therefore the symmetry condition was used to split the tank in two halves see fig 1 the air mass sink term proposed by ta 36 for the free surface was implemented via a user defined function recycled flow injectors with 5 mm internal diameter in the form of squares of equivalent area were modelled as a velocity inlet with the freshwater inlet being modelled as a velocity inlet with velocity value equal to 0 04 m s in the case of m18 and m19 and 0 06 m s in the case of m21 turbulent intensity was set to 5 for both inlets whereas clarified water outlet was modelled as a rectangular pipe the same as 22 26 with evenly distributed squares 20 squares per pipe and in which a pressure outlet condition was set a single phase solution within the multiphase framework but with zero air flow rate was previously calculated for each case and used as the initial solution for multiphase simulations the set of results presented and discussed in section 3 were obtained by steady state simulations although transient simulations were also carried out bondelind et al 20 put forward a theoretical argument that steady state simulations could be used in daf tank analysis although as far as the authors are concerned no practical demonstration has yet been published a comparison was made between the transient approach taken by other authors 21 22 and the steady state approach used in this study the former authors provided the results they obtained after 1000 s of simulation flow time which is equivalent to around two mean hydraulic residence mhr times in our transient simulations we reproduced their results at the aforementioned flow time but found that a quasi steady solution was not obtained at least not until a flow time equal to six mhr times was reached moreover the quasi steady solution obtained proved to be very similar from a qualitative and quantitative point of view to the solution obtained by steady state simulation the results and discussion of this benchmark study can be found in appendix a 2 2 mesh used for simulations firstly a mesh of 0 85 million cells was built similar to that done by other authors 21 22 this mesh was used to carry out transient simulations see appendix a although when refined it was found that the steady state solution changed while the number of cell elements increased therefore it was decided to perform a mesh independency test in order to determine the discretization error and obtain sufficiently fine mesh a procedure for estimating the discretization error based on richardson extrapolation was proposed by celik et al 37 currently this is the most practical method available for estimation of numerical uncertainties three meshes with high quality hexahedral elements a mesh example can be seen in fig 2 were refined systematically starting from a coarse mesh which contained 2 8 million elements a refinement factor of around 1 25 was used in order to generate medium size and fine size meshes resulting in medium and fine meshes with 5 7 and 10 7 million elements being created in order to perform mesh analysis it is necessary to select a flow variable φ which is a key parameter for the study in question in this study the volume weighted average of air fraction in the whole tank was chosen the grid convergence index or gci represents an upper limit of the discretization error and is calculated from the estimated relative error multiplied by the safety factor 1 25 for three mesh study see 37 the euler euler approach was used to analyse the m18 case with 67 μm bubbles in a steady state simulation in order to secure a small iterative error r air eq 7 was maintained below 10 5 in the simulations with the three meshes calculated gci for the fine mesh was equal to 1 1 although simulating a ten million cell mesh proved unpractical due to the high computational burden on the other hand the use of coarse mesh may have significantly affected the accuracy of the results hence in this study the 5 7 million mesh was used in order not to lose accuracy and not to dramatically increase calculation time the value of gcimedium was equal to 4 7 and this uncertainty value was therefore assumed in the results in this study it has been shown that the number of elements required for a mesh independent solution is considerably higher than that employed by other authors in literature hence it is recommended that a mesh independence analysis be performed in order to quantify the discretization error in daf tank studies 2 3 numerical resolution of the mathematical model the mathematical model was solved using the finite volume method fvm all of the terms of the partial differential equations were discretized using second order schemes except for the convective term of the volume fraction equation that was discretized using a first order upwind scheme pressure velocity and volume fraction of the phases were solved in a coupled way with commercial ansys fluent 2020r1 software having been used to solve the previously proposed mathematical model all the simulations were performed in parallel mode with 2 3 ghz 64 cpus on a linux server intel xeon gold 5218 256 gb ram with average time required to perform a steady state simulation using the mixture model being around 24 h using the mono diameter approach and 48 120 h in the case of the multi diameter approach depending on the number of secondary phases the convergence criteria were carefully analysed with continuity velocity and turbulence residuals being maintained at values below 10 5 except for air fraction whose residual was slightly higher in order to accept the solution all the flow variables had to reach a stable value and in steady state simulations one additional criterion was imposed in order to control air fraction convergence 7 r air abs m n m n np m n where m n is the volume weighted average of air fraction n is the current iteration and np is the number of iterations to be considered in this case np was equal to 50 r air was maintained below 10 5 for mono diameter analysis and below 10 4 for multi diameter analysis in the case of the latter this criterion was imposed for every secondary phase and by applying this rule we ensured that all simulations had a very low iterative error 2 4 bubble size critical diameter concept if realistic cfd results were to be obtained and used for design and operation it would be necessary to know the bubble size distribution bsd that exists in the daf tank analysed the problem is that bubble size is difficult to measure in existing systems or to predict in the systems that are to be designed lundh did not measure bubble diameter and for this reason the cfd studies that were carried out on his pilot plant used different bubble sizes for their part bondelind et al 20 used 40 80 and 120 μm chen et al 21 used 30 40 50 60 and 70 μm rodrigues et al 22 used 30 50 and 70 μm and deng et al 24 used 40 80 and 120 μm the flow structures obtained in previous cfd studies of the lundh pilot plant were especially dependent on bubble diameter and so for this reason other authors emmanouil et al 28 have also analysed the effect of the different bubble diameters in a different daf system in order to determine suitable bubble sizes for the cfd analysis of the present study the water velocity vectors and air content profile curves reported by lundh et al 7 were analysed together fig 3a shows the contour of air content and water velocity plotted as cones that were recreated from lundh s data see also fig 5a it should be pointed out that during lundh s experiments air profiles and water velocity vectors were measured with several months difference 6 meaning that there may be a discrepancy between air concentration and velocity vector fields nevertheless this difference is assumed not to be important and the combined contour air profile vectors provides reliable information for analytical purposes fig 3a shows two clearly identified flow structures in the upper part the stratified flow is represented by a horizontal flow rich with bubbles which is moving in the direction of the far end wall in the lower part of the sz air content is lower and the flow is moving vertically in the direction of the outlet pipe forming a plug flow like structure this vertical flow drags air bubbles up to the level of the outlet with the wwl being located at that height around 0 1 m as a conclusion it can be said that the wwl does not necessarily have to divide the stratified flow from the plug flow structures in order to reproduce the structure reported by lundh some of the bubbles must be dragged by the plug flow in which case their rising speed vb will be lower than the downward velocity of the vertical flow vs same as hl consequently critical diameter dc is defined as the bubble size where vb is equal to vs it should be noted that vb is obtained as a result of buoyancy and the drag force equilibrium see the simplified scheme in fig 3b from a pragmatic point of view stokes s law was used to calculate the dc although it should be pointed out that this is an approximate value of the critical diameter because turbulence contribution was not included however as the turbulence level in the lower part of the sz is low there should be no major change in diameter in cases m18 hl 11 3 m h and m19 hl 11 8 m h bubble dc is around 77 μm see table 2 four different bubble sizes were selected for the analysis in the course of which critical diameter and sizes above and below this were researched namely 57 67 and 87 μm in case m21 hl 17 7 m h critical diameter was 95 μm and sizes selected for the analysis were 85 90 95 and 100 μm with the aid of cfd simulations it was noted that using air bubble sizes greater or less than dc significantly affects the air content flow structure and wwl position inside the sz see table 3 in the results and discussion section it is expected that all bubble sizes greater than dc will tend to form a layer of air closer to the free surface while bubbles that are lower than dc will fill the sz domain up to the level of the outlet pipe finally it should be pointed out that mechanisms involving any change in size of bubbles are not implemented in this study information exists in literature about the coalescence and break up phenomenon in flotation columns 38 41 however the bubble diameter used in the flotation column around 1 mm is considerably larger than microbubbles in the daf and the use of these models in dissolved air flotation needs to be properly validated rodrigues et al 42 researched into lundh s pilot tank using a population balance model with coalescence and break up models that were validated in flotation columns obtaining little agreement between simulation results and experimental data 2 5 multi diameter approach in this section a new approach to analysing hydraulic behaviour of the separation zone is presented a wide range of bubble sizes can be found in daf tanks and modelling of the continuous bsd remains a challenging process however instead of directly introducing the continuous bsd and mechanisms that affect distribution several secondary phases are included in the mixture model each individual phase having its own distinct diameter the critical diameter concept is used to select representative bubble diameters whereby 82 and 87 μm diameters were selected for the m19 case analysis as bubble sizes above dc and 57 μm as the size below dc moreover 77 μm was added to see the effect of the bubbles with the size being very close to the critical diameter this approach not only permits different bubble dynamics to be taken into account but also the computational effort is not prohibitively costly the key advantage of this approach is that interactions between several air phases and the carrier phase can be analysed and it also allows the sauter diameter of the bubbles to be calculated throughout the daf tank computational cost is relatively low in comparison to the euler euler approach although the maximum number of secondary phases remains a constraint on the one hand computational cost is increasing and on the other convergence difficulty rises with the addition of every secondary phase simulations with multiple secondary phases have already been carried out by bondelind et al 20 and emmanouil et al 28 however these authors employed a euler lagrange approach in simplified 2d models and did not conduct an in depth analysis of the effect of the combination of the three secondary phases on sz hydraulics moreover the euler lagrange approach is limited by the fact that bubble size distribution cannot be obtained directly 3 results and discussion in this section the results of lundh s pilot tank simulations are presented in the course of which the influence of microbubble diameter mb on the hydraulics of the separation zone was studied additionally the importance of the critical diameter on the bubble s presence in the domain is also analysed and finally the multi diameter approach is used to predict air distribution in the stratified flow structure the cfd results obtained were compared to air concentration profiles and water velocity vectors contours that were measured by lundh these magnitudes are the most representative and were also used to validate cfd results by other authors 20 22 26 31 3 1 analysis of mono diameter bubbles on the hydraulic behaviour of the separation zone the influence of bubble diameter on the flow pattern is analysed in the case of m19 first see table 1 the results were plotted in a similar way to make the comparison between lundh s experimental data figs 3a and 5a and cfd simulations easier in his work 6 lundh warned that the velocity vector module measured might contain a major error due to the intrinsic difficulty of using acoustic doppler velocimetry adv in this complex multiphase flow for this reason only the maximum velocity value is shown in the images simulations carried out with 57 and 67 μm diameter showed a break through like pattern inside the sz see fig 4 although this phenomenon was not observed in lundh s experiments see fig 5a after passing beyond the baffle wall water current then moves in the direction of the outlet pipe however following analysis of the other xy planes it was observed that further away from the air injection device the effect of the break through like pattern was less pronounced flow behaviour is different in the case of 87 μm diameter bubbles this mb size is greater than critical diameter 77 μm and as a result most of the air escapes across the degassing condition and wwl is located above the tip of the baffle see fig 4d density is higher below the wwl whereby the flow current filled with bubbles cannot penetrate deeper into the sz consequently the flow is forced to move towards the opposite wall additionally higher water velocity values close to the free surface were observed for 87 μm diameter bubbles similar to lundh s fig 5a although air concentration was not well predicted finally the 77 μm is a very sensitive diameter and the flow develops behaviour somewhere between 67 and 87 μm air distribution along lines l1 l2 and l3 can be seen in figs 5b and 6a b and all the simulations with mono sized bubbles predicted air concentration around 4 ml l above the wwl this fact is represented by almost vertical shape curves in the figure while in contrast below wwl air concentration drastically falls to values close to zero the results of bondelind et al 26 for 80 μm bubbles were included for comparison in figs 5b and 6a b in which it can be observed that the air quantity predicted using the euler lagrange approach is considerably lower than experimental data and that predicted using the euler euler approach it was also observed that bubble diameter had a major effect on the position of the wwl and as a result the total quantity of air in the sz rising velocity of the bubbles with 57 67 and 77 μm diameter was lower than hl see table 2 and as a result wwl penetrates deeper into the tank up to outlet pipe level located 10 cm above the ground the results obtained from the simulations with mb diameter of 57 μm see figs 5b and 6a b showed acceptable results of between 60 and 120 cm in comparison to experimental data 7 although it was not possible to reproduce the gradual reduction in air content below 60 cm with mono diameter bubbles case m21 was studied in accordance with a mono diameter approach whereby the flow rate was increased by 50 in terms of m19 as a result obtaining hl equal to 17 7 m h see m21 in table 1 four bubble sizes were selected for the analysis including critical diameter which was around 95 μm the major changes in wwl and air concentration would be expected to be seen in the size range between 90 and 100 μm the air contour along with the velocity vector in the case of m21 can be seen in fig 7 the clear difference should be pointed out between the behaviour of the air bubbles whose size was less than critical diameter fig 7a b and greater than critical value fig 7d mbs with 85 and 90 μm diameter occupied almost the whole separation zone to outlet pipe level in addition the main water current moved in the direction of the far end wall in the upper part and was then deflected back to the baffle in the lower part the same pattern was also observed on the other xy planes indicating that the effect of the third dimension is less pronounced than in the case of m19 similar behaviour was reported by lundh 7 as stratified flow it is worth noting that qualitatively 90 μm bubbles fig 7b showed very similar air and velocity fields in comparison to experimental data see fig 3a while in the case of the 100 μm bubble fig 7b behaviour was completely different in comparison to 85 and 90 although it was similar to 87 μm bubbles in the case of m19 fig 4d the air phase was concentrated in the upper part and most of the bubbles were not capable of passing to the lower part due to high density difference in the case of 95 and 100 μm mbs the plug flow like pattern was observed below the wwl air concentration profiles plotted along lines l2 and l3 can be seen in fig 6c d the results showed that in the case of 85 and 90 μm bubbles wwl was positioned around 10 cm above the bottom of the tank at outlet pipe level while in that of 100 μm bubbles wwl was located at the height of 87 cm above the ground air concentration profiles for 90 μm bubbles measured on lines l2 and l3 proved to be more in line with experimental data in comparison to 100 μm it is likely that mean bubble diameter in lundh s experiment was lower than 95 μm because the position of the wwl as observed in the experiment was located around outlet pipe level see fig 6c d a summary of the mono diameter simulations can be seen in table 3 it is worth noting that there was a major difference in volume weighted average of air concentration between the lowest and highest bubble diameter value researched in each case air concentration decreased to a major extent when mb diameter was greater than critical diameter in addition the position of the wwl was also especially sensitive to critical diameter meaning that small changes in hl might significantly affect the wwl in cfd simulations this fact can be observed in table 3 when comparing values of the wwl position of 77 μm bubbles in m18 and m19 simulation results in the case of m18 the hl is slightly lower and therefore the wwl position is slightly higher 0 3 m in comparison to m19 0 14 m finally it should be added that m18 contours were not included in this paper however the conclusions drawn in the case of m18 were very similar as for m19 and only air phase related values can be seen in table 3 air eliminated by means of the mass sink term divided by air entering through the recycled inlets degassing air in table 3 was compared to air bubble removal efficiency used in conventional daf designs vb vs a discrepancy was found in the case of mb diameters that were lower than critical which could be explained by the fact that conventional theory only takes into account air leaving above the sz domain and that the cfd also considers air leaving above the cz 3 2 multi diameter analysis in the previous section it was seen that single diameter bubbles created even distribution of air inside the sz up to outlet level namely around 4 ml l of air concentration in the case of m19 and m21 nevertheless experimental results obtained from the m19 case showed a gradual decrease in air concentration below 60 cm of tank height although this behaviour was not possible to predict with single diameter bubbles in the case of m21 the experiments did not detect any progressive decay of air concentration and so the prediction made using the mono diameter was sufficient a simulation with operating conditions as in the m19 case was carried out using the multi diameter approach as mentioned in section 2 5 four secondary phases were included with 57 77 82 and 87 μm bubble diameters the same total quantity of air as in the mono diameter approach was introduced at the recycled velocity inlet and the air was evenly distributed across the four phases stratified flow structure was obtained by combining bubbles with different rising velocities see fig 8 air concentration was higher in the upper part of the sz because mb of a greater size occupied the region closer to the free surface while smaller mbs filled the whole sz domain up to outlet pipe level see fig 10a for its part air contour evidenced different concentrations that were reduced as the y coordinate decreased especially in the region of the l2 and l3 lines regarding velocity vectors higher velocities were observed close to the free surface on the upper part the main current moved from the cz to sz in the direction of the opposite wall and the current was then deflected downward however a small proportion of the main flow formed a break through like pattern in the region closer to the separation baffle finally the plug flow structure formed in the lower part higher velocities on the upper part and plug flow on the lower part are a phenomenon reported by lundh see fig 5a although a break through like pattern and higher velocities at the top were also observed in mono diameter results in the case of 57 and 87 μm see fig 4a and d meaning that the multi diameter simulation maintains the characteristics of the mono diameter ones following analysis of the other xy planes it was observed that the break through like pattern is less pronounced further away from the injector and as a result the plug flow like structure extends through the whole length of the separation zone below the tip of the baffle air content profiles measured on lines l1 l2 and l3 can be seen in fig 9a c air concentration was better predicted compared to experimental results in the region of the l2 and l3 lines because of lower water velocity in comparison to mono diameter simulation of 57 and 87 μm mbs the results obtained using the multi diameter simulation were able to predict a progressive reduction in air content below 0 6 m of the y coordinate nevertheless air concentration predicted in the region from 0 6 to 1 2 m was lower than values reported by lundh finally there was less agreement with experimental data in the case of the l1 region where the short circuit pattern was detected fig 10 shows air distribution inside the sz while a histogram of air diameter distribution along line l2 can be seen in fig 10a as rising velocity of 57 μm bubbles was well below hl their presence could be found in the whole separation zone above the outlet pipe conversely in the case of 87 μm bubbles rising velocity was higher than hl as a result their position was limited to a 30 cm high layer located below the water surface see similar behaviour in mono diameter simulations in figs 4d and 7d intermediate sizes 77 and 82 μm were distributed in different heights as a function of their rising speed the sauter diameter contour was created by combining air distribution of the four secondary phases see fig 10b this contour indicates that most of the large bubble diameters were concentrated on the top layer although a small part of the 82 and 87 μm bubbles were dragged deeper into the sz domain due to the break through current as a result the sauter diameter value increased in the region of the l1 line although conversely uniform decay of the bubble sauter diameter was observed closer to the opposite wall ultimately the results showed that air distribution contains characteristics of the four secondary phases this observation was also reported by bondelind 20 finally in order to assess the sensitivity of the model in terms of air distribution a couple of additional studies were undertaken such as changing air concentration of the highest and lowest bubble diameters this means that the original air distribution see fig 9a c which comprised evenly distributed air concentrations was modified the volume fraction of 87 μm air bubbles was doubled and total air quantity at the recycled inlet was therefore increased by 25 in comparison to the air concentration value measured by lundh an equivalent experiment was conducted using the 57 μm fraction where only the 57 μm fraction was modified and the rest remained equal when 87 μm air fraction was increased the tendency was to move the upper part between 0 8 and 1 2 cm of the curve to the right i e by increasing air concentration only on the top most layer see fig 11 in contrast when the 57 μm fraction was increased all of the air profile was displaced to the right meaning that total presence of air increased in the domain in summary these studies showed that it is possible to modify the shape of the air profile obtained by varying air fraction distribution and bubble diameter 4 conclusions the cfd model of lundh s pilot tank was analysed using mono and multi diameter approaches in the course of which it was ascertained that the solution obtained via a steady state simulation was very similar to that obtained by sufficiently long flow time transient simulations additionally it was confirmed that the multiphase mixture model offered almost identical results to the euler euler model and is suitable for carrying out daf tank simulations the critical diameter dc concept was introduced and demonstrated that it is a useful tool for daf cfd studies for all of the case studies examined the results obtained from the mono diameter simulations showed two clearly discernible types of behaviour depending on whether the bubble diameter was greater or less than dc in simulations where the selected size was greater than dc bubbles would be concentrated in the upper part of the sz as a result the density of the layer located closer to the free surface was lower forcing the water current to move in the direction of the far end wall water velocity vectors were similar to experimental results although air profile curve was not predicted in the case of simulations in which the bubble size was less than dc the whole sz was filled with air up to outlet pipe level in all mono diameter simulations air profile plots were shown as almost vertical curves up to white water level wwl the experimental results in which lundh obtained a smooth air profile curve with progressive decrease below 60 cm of sz height m19 case were not possible to reproduce using the mono diameter approach nevertheless the approximately uniform air distribution up to outlet pipe level predicted in the case of m21 was closely in line with experimental data in order to reproduce a smooth air profile curve the combined effect of different bubble sizes close to the critical diameter value proved necessary the multi diameter approach is proposed as an appropriate method for predicting the gradual reduction of air reported by lundh in the case of m19 a stratified flow structure was reproduced although a small short circuit like pattern was formed close to the baffle the results showed that air bubbles were distributed in layers as a function of their rising speed generating an air profile curve very similar to the curve reported by lundh for its part prediction considerably improved for tank height lower than 60 cm although in contrast prediction of air concentration worsened closer to the free surface additionally this approach provided the chance to analyse air distribution and calculate the mean values of the bubble diameter as a function of tank height sensitivity of the model to changes in air distribution in the inlet was evaluated its being observed that increasing the quantity of the air phase of the highest diameter affected only the upper layer of the sz meanwhile an increase in the fraction of the lowest diameter displaced the air profile curve to the right meaning that air concentration increased in the whole sz up to outlet level this cfd study was conducted on a pilot daf tank although the approaches and ideas proposed in this study are equally valid for a full scale tank analysis they can be used by designers in the preliminary design of the sz in cases where bubble sizes are not known in addition cfd modellers in the wastewater field can also benefit from them to improve prediction of their simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

appendix a benchmark using the studies by chen et al and rodrigues et al chen et al 21 carried out simulations in lundh s daf tank using 0 01 s timesteps and reported a converged solution for a flow time of 1000 s which is approximately two mean hydraulic residence times mhr 490 s additionally rodrigues et al 22 and deng et al 24 also obtained their results simulating up to a flow time of 1000 s our intention was to reproduce the studies by chen and rodrigues and carry out transient simulations of m18 and m19 cases using the euler euler approach the domain was discretized with 0 85 million cells which is a mesh similar in size to that used by chen and rodrigues chen reported close agreement with experimental data for 50 and 60 μm bubble sizes and so 50 μm diameter bubbles were therefore selected to analyse the m18 and m19 cases case study m19 was simulated in accordance with the methodology proposed by chen et al 21 the boundary conditions were the same as those reported by the authors with the most significant being that the water surface was modelled as a frictionless wall the air profile on line l2 obtained for different flow times can be seen in fig a1 a while air profile values for 1000 s were taken from chen and included in the figure the results showed that if the simulation was stopped at 1000 s the air profile obtained would be closely in line with experimental data provided by lundh et al 7 however if the simulation was continued up to 3000 s the air concentration curve would take the form of an almost vertical line this indicating that the air phase tends to be evenly distributed throughout the whole sz above the outlet pipe with concentration value around 4 ml l ultimately it was observed that the volume weighted average of air fraction in 3000 s was increased by 51 in comparison to 1000 s therefore two mhr times proved not to be enough to obtain a stable solution for the m19 case study it is worth mentioning that in this study a quasi steady solution was not possible to obtain due to convergence difficulties that appeared after 3000 s since the free surface was modelled as a frictionless wall an accumulation of air appeared adjacent to the free surface that prevented the simulation from converging fig a1 air concentration profile on line l2 for case m19 a and for case m18 b for different flow times the results taken from chen et al 21 and rodrigues et al 22 and lundh et al 7 were added to the plot fig a1 case study m18 was simulated using the methodology proposed by rodrigues et al 22 the air concentration profile obtained on line l2 for 600 1000 3000 and 10 000 s is depicted in fig a1 b together with the result presented by rodrigues et al 18 at 1000 s twice the mhr time at this flow time both simulation results were very similar and predicted air concentration values below 0 6 m of tank height that were closely in line with the results obtained by lundh et al 7 however if the simulation were continued for another four mhr times until 3000 s the air profile curve would show an approximately constant value around 2 ml l of air concentration above the outlet pipe the average concentration in the tank being increased by 31 in comparison to 1000 s therefore as in the case of m19 it was concluded that carrying out a transient simulation for two mhr times was also not sufficient for the purpose of reaching a quasi steady solution extending the simulation from 3000 s to 10 000 s produced only slight changes at the upper and lower ends of the air profile curve moreover average air concentration in the tank increased asymptotically only by 3 therefore as speculated by bondelind et al 20 the results showed a flow structure that was time dependent at the beginning of the simulation although when the general flow pattern was established the solution became almost independent of time hence the solution for 10 000 s can be assumed to be the quasi steady solution while the solution for 3000 s is so close to the latter that it can be considered a good approximation finally the most important finding in this benchmark was that steady state simulation provided a solution that was very similar to the quasi steady solution see fig a1 b albeit taking only a fraction of the computation time the average air concentration in the tank obtained via steady state simulation was only 1 higher than that calculated via transient simulation for 10 000 s therefore carrying out steady state simulations proved to be a suitable approach for the purpose of analysing daf systems appendix b comparison between euler euler and mixture models the m18 and m19 cases were analysed using two multiphase models namely the euler euler and mixture models it should be pointed out that in order to compare both models the same two forces were included drag and buoyancy in the euler euler approach four different bubble diameters 57 67 77 and 87 μm were used in the study air contours along with the water velocity vectors can be found in fig b1 simulations have evidenced very similar distribution of the air phase and velocity vector fields from the qualitative point of view in the case of both models the major changes were observed in the contours of critical diameter bubbles see fig b1 c and g because the flow structure was very sensitive to this bubble size it is worth mentioning that the time and computational resource required to perform simulation via the mixture approach were considerably lower in comparison to the euler euler approach air contours for m18 were not included because the results were also very similar table b1 air distribution and wwl position for different mb sizes in the case of euler euler eu eu and mixture approaches aaf is the volume

table b1 reinforces the conclusions reached for fig b1 volume weighted average of air fraction was calculated for different bubble diameters inside the daf tank domain providing practically identical values in the case of both models additionally wwl was determined and the results were very similar and it was concluded that both models were equally valid for the purpose of performing daf tank simulations fig b1 m19 case simulated using euler euler a d and mixture e h the contours show air phase distribution along with water velocity vectors for different bubble diameters 57 μm a e 67 μm b
