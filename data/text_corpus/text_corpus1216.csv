6080,overland flow through an ephemeral gully eg system integrates flow from upslope areas and lateral side slopes lateral overland inflow creates tributaries to the main eg channel for runoff and sediment discharge which exacerbates the eg erosion and local soil degradation however research concerning tributary formation by overland flow especially contributions of overland upslope and lateral inflows to eg erosion are still lacking thus simulated rainfall and inflow experiments under two erosive rainfall intensities 50 and 100 mm h 1 and two typical slope gradients 15 and 20 were conducted under representative lateral and upslope overland inflow conditions using an 8 m long 2 m wide and 0 6 m deep soil pan the results showed that upslope and lateral inflow both contributed to the runoff connectivity of the eg channel and lateral rills in the eg system for these simulated conditions upslope inflow contributions to total runoff and soil loss were 62 78 and 65 81 respectively while lateral inflow only contributed around 10 the contribution differences could be attributed to flow hydrodynamic characteristics in that shear stress and stream power in the eg channel were 4 9 8 6 times greater than those on the lateral slopes lateral inflow was important to lateral rill formation which contributed to imbricated landform and lateral gradient formation process and consequently promoted runoff and sediment connectivity of the eg system soil erosion induced by concentrated flow in channels and sheet flow in interill areas coarsened soil textures soil particles lager than 0 02 mm increased 12 6 on average which may contribute to reduction of local soil productivity this work demonstrates the critical need of preventing both upslope and lateral drainage into eg channels keywords ephemeral gully tributaries flow hydrodynamics concentrated flow rill erosion flow path soil texture 1 introduction ephemeral gullies egs are small channels eroded by concentrated flow that can be easily filled by normal tillage only to be reformed again in the same location soil science society of america 2008 zheng et al 2017 this definition agrees with those for shallow gully erosion proposed by zhu 1956 and mega rill erosion proposed by foster 1986 while the eg term still needs some clarification egs tend to have two opposite lateral side slopes and an upper contributing area capra and la spada 2015 surface runoff induces concentrated flow along the thalweg of rills or micro depressions which initiates headcuts and the formation of an eg main channel with time runoff on lateral side slopes concentrates in rills that feed the eg main channel and these lateral rills develop into eg branches which can be fed by newly formed rills in previous interrill areas eg main channel eg branches and rills are organized with time into a fully developed eg network such an eg network increases the hydrologic connectivity of the landscape poesen et al 2003 while also dissecting the landscape into an imbricated landform zhu 1956 gong et al 2011 capra et al 2009 used eg system to represent the whole of the main branch eg channel and the interconnected tributaries of an eg to study rainfall characteristics impact on eg erosion thus eg systems can be used as an integration of the entire network contributing to eg channels capra et al 2011 capra 2013 whatever the definition is eg systems can be the dominant sediment source in agricultural watersheds previous studies conducted in u s mediterranean region of western europe australia loess plateau and the mollisol region of china all showed that egs contribute the majority of total soil loss and the contribution rate can even reach up to 100 casalí et al 1999 bennett et al 2000a wijdenes et al 2000 poesen et al 2003 hancock and evans 2006 cheng et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 porto et al 2014 capra and la spada 2015 given the high soil loss eg erosion leads to soil degradation and crop productivity loss liu et al 2013 the reoccurrence over time of rainfall induced overland flow removing large amounts of soil from the eg system and mechanical tillage operations filling the eroded channels with adjacent surface soil materials can greatly exacerbate the soil losses from an eg system nachtergaele et al 2001 gordon et al 2008 these two cyclical events lead to the decline of both topsoil depth liu et al 2013 and soil quality from lateral slopes adjacent to the eg xu et al 2016 ollobarren et al 2016 wilson et al 2018 ollobarren et al 2016 observed the soil quality index sqi in an eg system in central sicily and found the lowest sqi inside of the eg channel and in the nearby areas xu et al 2016 compared the soil physicochemical properties in eg bottom and inter gully areas and found the soil physical quality properties were predominately degraded in the first stage of eg erosion in subsequent stages of eg erosion soil chemical quality i e nutrient losses dominated the soil degradation hydrologic processes like rainfall capra et al 2009 han et al 2017 overland flow and subsurface flow tebebu et al 2010 wilson 2011 wilson et al 2015 frankl et al 2016 zegeye et al 2018 are the main drivers contributing to the formation and development of egs there are numerous subprocesses included e g particle detachment by shear forces headcutting bennett et al 2000b hosseinalizadeh

gully side walls zegeye et al 2018 in an eg system driven by surface flow that is mainly discussed in this paper overland inflow can be divided into upslope inflow and lateral inflow upslope inflow is generated from the contributing area above the eg headcut below the watershed boundary line lateral inflow is generated from both sides of the channel by concentrated flow in rills as well as sheet flow from interrill areas upslope inflow is related to the upslope drainage topography soil properties and rainfall characteristics casalí et al 1999 cheng et al 2007 gutiérrez et al 2009 capra and la spada 2015 zegeye et al 2016 xu et al 2017 upslope inflow can significantly increase the runoff velocity shear stress and energy of flows through the eg channel and hence the eg erosion magnitude wu et al 2004 2019 gong et al 2011 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 conducted controlled laboratory experiments and found that runoff velocities were 23 79 larger with upslope inflow than without and upslope inflow was more effective than rainfall at increasing runoff and soil erosion wu et al 2019 used a series of field rainfall simulation experiments to investigate different inflow and sediment conditions impact on the eg erosion and found that flow velocities in eg channels were greater than those on the lateral slopes and sediment concentration increase had a limited effect on the runoff velocities in the eg channel given the typical concave topography of eg systems in which the main channel lies in the bottom of a swale with two lateral side slopes interconnected tributaries of lateral inflow channels can also be the main source of runoff and sediment contributing to the eg erosion and local soil degradation when an eg system develops however studies that combine upslope and lateral inflows are essentially nonexistent and their interactions are not well understood or described especially on steep slope landforms like the loess plateau where eg systems are widely distributed soil particle size distribution can reflect the size selectivity of erosion which has great significance on understanding soil erosion and degradation processes shi et al 2012 wang and shi 2015 found that sediment became coarser after rills developed because of increases in flow depth and runoff energy however changes in the soil particle size distribution within the eg systems are still not clear former studies on egs induced soil physical property changes are usually based on ground truth surveys of fields combined with laboratory analysis of soil samples ollobarren et al 2016 xu et al 2016 few studies have been done to demonstrate erosion selectivity as an eg system develops in response to concentrated flow therefore a series of laboratory rainfall and inflow experiments were conducted under different slope gradients rainfall intensities upslope and lateral inflow conditions to quantify how upslope and lateral inflows affect eg erosion the specific objectives were 1 to discriminate the contributions of upslope and lateral overland inflows to the runoff and soil loss rates in an eg system 2 to understand lateral rill flow contributions to runoff connectivity of an eg system 3 to quantify the flow hydrodynamic characteristics in eg system and 4 to investigate the eg erosion impacts on soil particle size distribution changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the same side sprinkler rainfall simulator system was used as xu et al 2017 which provided spatial uniformity of rainfall and terminal velocity raindrop diameters were calibrated by laser precipitation monitor mode 5 4110 10 200 adolf thies gmbh co kg göttingen germany varying from 0 2 to 3 8 mm a slope adjustable soil pan was used to conduct the simulation experiments which is 8 m long 2 m wide and 0 6 m deep there are many drainage holes at the bottom with 2 cm aperture at the upper end of the soil pan an overflow tank was set to simulate the inflow from an upper contributing area in the field gravel was glued on the rigid floor connecting the tank and soil bed which decreased the flow energy entering the soil bed and acted as baffle structure fig 1 a 1b before each experiment upslope inflow discharge was adjusted by intake valves and calibrated li et al 2016 lateral inflow to both sides of the soil pan was applied by flexible pipes with holes every 10 cm along the pipe the inner diameter of the pipe was 12 mm and the diameter of each hole was 2 mm the lateral inflow pipe on each side of the soil pan supplied inflow under a constant head onto a waterproof plate on both sides of the soil pans one end of the waterproof plate was attached to the sidewall and buried in the soil bed while the other end was extended 20 cm away from the soil pan sidewall the angle between the extended plate and horizontal plane was 20 which was a typical angle of lateral slopes in eg systems on the loess plateau these two plates were covered with permeable cloth to allow the lateral inflow to spread uniformly when it entered the soil bed fig 1c lateral inflow discharge was calibrated before each test and lateral pipes were set up and removed easily within a short time during the experiments which made it possible to shift lateral inflow conditions in order to separately collect runoff and sediment samples from the eg channel and lateral slopes during each run three triangular runoff and sediment collecting devices were installed at the lower end of soil pan fig 1a the triangular runoff collector in the middle was 40 cm high which was coupled with a 30 cm deep end plate the end plate was downward adjustable from the initial soil surface to 30 cm below the initial surface during the experiment as the eg developed this was to avoid sediment deposition at the outlet of the soil pan as the eg channel developed the width of the middle collector was 30 cm that is the typical eg width during experiments two 85 cm wide runoff collectors were installed on the two sides of the main channel these collectors were fixed in place and installed at the initial soil bed surface 2 2 soil bed preparation soil materials used was loess soil 16 1 sand 61 5 silt 22 4 clay calcic cambisols usda taxonomy and the detailed soil characteristics and preprocessing procedures were the same as described in xu et al 2017 when packing the soil bed a 5 cm sand layer was first settled at bottom for free drainage then 25 cm plow pan and 20 cm tillage layer were packed in 5 cm increments detailed packing procedures can be found in xu et al 2017 an initial eg channel was built on soil bed surface according to the topographic characteristics of natural egs gong et al 2011 in this study a curved plank was used to make this initial eg channel fig 1 and the maximum depth of the pre formed channel was about 12 cm after forming the initial eg channel manual tillage was applied to a depth of approximately 20 cm along the contour line using a shovel this procedure was intended to simulate the natural cropland tillage practice in early april before the rainy season in the loess plateau 2 3 experimental design high intensity and short duration rainstorms frequently occur in the loess plateau during the summer causing severe soil loss gully growth and related natural hazards wei et al 2007 han et al 2017 based on the erosive rainfall standard i 5 1 52 mm min 1 about 91 2 mm h 1 on the loess plateau two representative rainfall intensities 50 and 100 mm h 1 were used in this study zhou and wang 1987 egs are widely distributed on 15 35 hillslopes on the loess plateau therefore two typical slope gradients 15 and 20 were used in this study jiang et al 1999 three treatments were conducted to compare eg erosion under different slope gradients and rainfall intensities treatment 1 was 15 slope and 50 mm h 1 rainfall intensity treatment 2 was 20 slope and 50 mm h 1rainfall and treatment 3 was 20 slope and 100 mm h 1 rainfall each treatment was replicated twice upslope and lateral inflow discharges were designed according to the eg system morphology observed on the loess plateau zhang et al 1991 cheng et al 2007 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 1991 reported that the lateral distance between adjacent egs was about 16 m on average and the critical slope length for the initiation of egs was about 40 m thus for 8 m long soil bed the lateral drainage area was approximately 128 m2 while upslope drainage area was 640 m2 thus the lateral and upslope inflow rates used were 8 and 40 l min 1 respectively under typical rainfall intensity after applying the runoff coefficient observed in the research region wei et al 2007 upslope inflow discharge was about five times larger than lateral inflow rate because of the differences in drainage areas to discriminate the contributions of upslope and lateral inflow to eg erosion a series of experimental stages with and without upslope and lateral inflow were conducted table 1 a total of four stages were included in each run the first stage only rain stage i was used to test the rainfall induced soil erosion the second stage rain lateral inflow stage ii was to acquire the lateral inflow impact followed by a check of rainfall induced soil erosion at this stage in the third stage rain upslope inflow stage iii upslope inflow was added to test its impact while eliminating the lateral inflow component this was followed again by a check on rainfall induced erosion for this stage at the fourth stage rain upslope inflow lateral inflow stage iv upslope and lateral inflow were both applied to test their combined impacts on soil loss then soil erosion rates under lateral inflow applied while eliminating upslope inflow condition and rain only condition were checked when calculating inflow contribution rain induced runoff and soil loss in each stage stage ii iii iv was first calculated by interpolating the values in nearby rain only conditions as 1 r ri r i 1 r i 2 s ri s i 1 s i 2 where rri and s ri are the rain induced runoff and soil loss at stage i i ii iii iv ri and si are the runoff and soil loss rate of only rain treatment at stage i i ii iii iv for stage ii lateral inflow and iii upslope inflow the contribution of inflow from each individual source was calculated as the combined rainfall plus inflow measurement minus the contribution of rain only part for stage iv when upslope and lateral inflow were both applied with rainfall contribution of each inflow component was calculated as 2 r c l r r l r riv r r l 100 s c l s r l s riv s r l 100 r c u l r r u l r riv r r u l 100 s c u l s r u l s riv s r u l 100 r c u r c u l r c l s c u s c u l s c l where rcl rcu l rcu scl scu l scu are the runoff and soil loss contributions from the lateral inflow the sum of upslope and lateral inflow and the upslope inflow respectively rr l rr u l sr l s r u l are runoff and soil loss rate of rain lateral inflow and rain upslope inflow lateral inflow treatments at stage iv 2 4 experimental procedure a flowchart of experiments is shown in fig 2 pre soak rain with 30 mm h 1 rainfall intensity was conducted to decrease spatial variations of surface soil moisture and roughness conditions xu et al 2017 before each experiment rainfall intensity and inflow rates were calibrated to target values spatial uniformity of rainfall intensity was over 90 that met the requirements the soil pan was then adjusted to the tested slope and exposed to the prescribed rainfall intensity and inflow rate upslope and lateral inflows were applied or removed by following the treatment conditions listed in table 1 for the different stages once runoff reached an equilibrium rate runoff rate variation smaller than 10 average value in different stages which usually took about 1 2 min runoff and sediment samples were collected continuously in 15 l buckets at the outlets every 1 2 min the duration from adjusting boundary hydrological condition to equilibrium stage would vary a little bit because of different slope degree and rainfall intensity but all treatments were completed within 55 60 min making treatments comparable the number of samples in each stage is listed in table 1 the runoff samples were weighed immediately and then sediment settling and decanting were conducted at last all sediment samples were dried at 105 c and weighed for further calculation during experiments a leica nova ms50 total station laser scanner leica geosystems ag heerbrugg switzerland was used to monitor the morphology changes as the eg system developed the scanning resolution was 1 cm 1 cm which was high enough for analysis of eg morphology and tracking flow path changes acquired point cloud data were first denoised and unified in the cyclone 6 0 software and then imported into arcgis 10 4 to form dems then flow paths were extracted by hydrologic analysis module in spatial analysis tools the processing steps for generating stream networks include identifying sinks determining flow directions and calculating flow accumulations wu et al 2018 flow accumulation threshold was set as 150 to reflect all rills on the slope surface qin et al 2018b overland flow velocities in eg channel and on lateral slopes were measured at four slope positions 1 3 5 7 m of slope length along the soil bed by kmno4 dye tracer method with three replicates at each point flow depth was measured perpendicularly to the surface using a thin ruler and read to 0 1 mm precision 2 5 flow hydrodynamic characteristics depth averaged flow velocity v was calculated based on the surface velocity v s measured during the experiment as 3 v k v s where k is the coefficient that is 0 67 for laminar flow and 0 8 for turbulent flow horton et al 1934 emmett 1970 li et al 1996 generally lateral overland flow is dominated by laminar flow while flow in eg channel is turbulent flow thus mean flow velocities at different positions were calculated using different coefficients shear stress reflected runoff energies to deliver the mass in runoff and was calculated as 4 τ γ r j where τ is shear stress pa γ is the specific weight of water n m 3 r is hydraulic radius calculated by flow depth m j is surface slope m m 1 calculated as the sine of the slope degree as the bed slope and channel slope would be different at various spatial positions through the experiment dems acquired from scanned point clouds at corresponding moments of the experiment were used to get the average slope degree values of the measured flow paths stream power representing the expenditure of the power of water per unit area was calculated as nearing et al 1991 5 ω τ v where ω is stream power n m 1 s 1 2 6 soil particle size distribution analysis in order to compare soil particle size distributions before and after eg erosion soil samples were collected both in eg channel and on lateral slope surfaces at 1 m increments from 1 to 7 m slope length to evaluate soil degradation by soil erosion soil samples on the lateral slope surfaces were collected 0 5 m away from the eg channel a pipette method was used in this study for particle size analysis before testing soil samples were pre processed to remove organic matter and disperse clays soil samples were first air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve then 6 h2o2 and 0 2 mol l 1 hcl were used to eliminate organic matter and carbonate respectively 0 05 mol l 1 hcl and distilled water were used to wash out ca2 and cl then 0 5 mol l 1 naoh was added and the solution allowed to stand overnight after stirring eshel et al 2004 at last the solution was dispersed by using ultrasonic mixing 160 w 10 15 min after the pre processing 10 g soil samples were weighed for pipette analysis 3 results 3 1 eg development processes fig 3 shows a typical eg system developing and the morphological changes associated with the experimental stages with rainfall upslope inflow and lateral inflow applied at different stages the ephemeral gully and rills developed over time the 100 mm h 1 and 20 treatment is presented as an example of the overland flow impacts on ephemeral gully development at the beginning of stage i when only rainfall was applied fig 3a sheet flow from lateral slopes gradually concentrated into the pre formed eg channel from both sides according to the pre formed topography as such sheet erosion was dominant at this stage during stage ii lateral inflow combined with rainfall induced concentrated flow along the lateral slopes as well as in eg channel convergent flow within the eg channel initiated headcutting of the eg main channel fig 3b lateral slopes of the eg system during stage ii gradually formed fixed flow paths and rill erosion started to dominate the soil erosion process in stage iii upslope inflow into the eg main channel resulted in disconnected headcuts fig 3c and then became connected to form a well defined eg channel fig 3d in stage iv the addition of lateral inflow to rainfall and upslope inflow quickly resulted in connectivity of lateral rills with the main channel fig 3e these rill tributaries to the main channel occurred on both lateral side slopes and resulted in rapid widening of the eg main channel as stage iv progressed the eg channel depth increased and rills on lateral slopes became eg tributaries that themselves had rill branches thereby forming a complete eg system fig 3f it was the synergistic effects of rainfall upslope inflow and lateral inflow that led to the progressive rill and ephemeral gully erosion that produced the eg system and excessive soil loss 3 2 runoff and soil loss responses to different inflow conditions 3 2 1 runoff responses runoff processes responded to the inflow conditions as expected fig 4 as rainfall continued in stage i the runoff rate increased with time when lateral inflow was added to rainfall in stage ii the runoff rate jumped up particularly for the higher rainfall and slope condition when rainfall was combined with upslope inflow in stage iii the runoff rate jumped up even higher despite the formation of rills and a well connected eg main channel the runoff dropped back down to the previous rainfall only runoff rate when all three sources were contributing in stage iv the runoff rate jumped up to slightly higher than stage iii due to the addition of lateral inflow but then dropped down significantly in stage iv when upslope inflow ceased for the 50 mm h 1 rainfall intensity runoff rates in the 20 treatment treatment 2 were slightly larger 4 than those in 15 treatment treatment 1 when only rainfall was applied with means of 2 16 and 2 25 l min 1 table 2 respectively however when rainfall intensity increased to 100 mm h 1 treatment 3 the runoff rate averaged 9 79 l min 1 and was 2 2 3 8 times larger than those in treatments 1 and 2 respectively this was the result of excess infiltration runoff induced by the larger rainfall intensity wei et al 2007 xu et al 2017 when lateral inflow was applied at stage ii table 2 runoff rates were significantly increased compared with stage i rainfall only the runoff rate increased by 298 353 and 214 for treatments 1 2 and 3 50 mm h 1 rainfall intensity for the 15 and 20 slopes and 100 mm h 1 rainfall intensity for the 20 slope respectively the subsequent runoff rates for rainfall alone were all larger than those at stage i by 144 178 and 166 respectively this can be attributed to the saturation of soil and development of rills providing flow path connectivity on lateral slopes when upslope inflow was added to this rainfall condition stage iii the runoff rates increased by more than an order of magnitude 1163 and 1274 for treatments 1 and 2 respectively but only by 292 for treatment 3 runoff rates under the three treatments varied from 64 0 to 68 9 l min 1 from 83 2 to 88 4 l min 1 and from 99 4 to 104 4 l min 1 respectively while the eg and lateral rills were substantially more developed at this stage compared to stage ii the rainfall only prior to stage iii was essentially the same as following stage iii similarly for stage iv rain upslope inflow lateral inflow the runoff rates increased about the same as in stage iii 1445 1354 and 282 for treatments 1 2 and 3 respectively under these three treatments runoff rates varied from 77 2 to 83 5 l min 1 from 89 3 to 95 3 l min 1 and from 107 6 to 112 9 l min 1 respectively when upslope inflow was removed the runoff rates obviously decreased fig 4 however runoff rates for rainfall plus lateral inflow at stage iv were 215 203 and 72 larger for the three treatments respectively than for this same condition at stage ii varying from 16 3 to 20 1 l min 1 from 18 7 to 22 7 l min 1 and from 40 7 to 43 2 l min 1 respectively 3 2 2 soil loss responses soil loss rates exhibited similar patterns as the runoff responses figs 4 and 5 at the beginning when only rain was applied soil loss rate was low and slightly increased with time as for runoff soil loss rate jumped when lateral flow was included then jumped even higher when upslope inflow was added and dropped back down between each stage when rainfall alone was applied the main differences between runoff and soil loss responses was the influencing degree the inflow impact on soil loss was greater than that on runoff alone for stage i when slope for the 50 mm h 1 rainfall intensity was increased from 15 to 20 the soil loss rate increased by 55 table 2 however when rainfall intensity for 20 slope was increased from 50 mm h 1 to 100 mm h 1 the soil loss rate increased by 500 varying from 1 5 to 4 8 kg min 1 the addition of lateral inflow in stage ii increased soil loss rates by 966 715 and 293 over rainfall alone for treatments 1 2 and 3 respectively soil loss in stage ii was dominated by rill erosion on the lateral slopes for treatments 1 and 2 and by ephemeral gully head advance and rill development for treatment 3 in response to higher rainfall intensity after lateral inflow was terminated and runoff was generated by rainfall alone soil loss rates decreased substantially but were still 521 412 and 229 greater for treatments 1 2 and 3 respectively than those in stage i for rainfall only thus the effects of soil wetting up and rill occurrence were more dramatic on soil loss than runoff in stage iii rain upslope inflow soil loss rates for the three treatments increased by 1412 1244 and 303 over the previous rainfall alone this is a greater increase than observed for runoff when upslope inflow was subsequently terminated soil loss rates went back down to essentially the same level as before upslope inflow following stage ii despite the better flow path connectivity for stage iv rain upslope inflow lateral inflow soil loss rates for the three treatments were 41 7 44 2 kg min 1 45 4 49 7 kg min 1 and 53 7 59 2 kg min 1 respectively this is higher than all other hydrologic conditions and is a larger increase from stage iii to iv 1938 1463 and 319 for treatments 1 2 3 respectively than observed for runoff when upslope inflow and lateral inflow were eliminated soil loss rates in treatments 1 and 2 were more than double what they were after stage ii and iii but only slightly higher for treatment 3 3 3 discrimination of upslope and lateral inflow contributions to eg erosion the contributions of upslope and lateral inflow were discriminated for all treatments and hydrologic conditions under the rain lateral inflow condition lateral inflow contributions to slope surface runoff and soil loss were influenced by rainfall intensity lateral inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss varied from 56 7 to 58 3 and from 62 5 to 66 2 respectively for treatments 1 and 2 thus when slope gradient increased the lateral inflow contributions did not change much when rainfall intensity increased from 50 to 100 mm h 1 lateral inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss decreased to 41 7 and 45 4 respectively under the rain upslope inflow condition upslope inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss varied from 92 2 to 92 7 and from 92 5 to 93 8 respectively for treatments 1 and 2 thus an increase of slope gradient from 15 to 20 had no effect on upslope inflow induced runoff and soil loss when rainfall intensity increased from 50 mm h 1 to 100 mm h 1 upslope inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss decreased to 73 0 and 73 3 which is to be expected since upslope inflow rate was not adjusted and held constant while the rainfall intensity increased under the rain upslope inflow lateral inflow condition upslope inflow plus lateral inflow total contributions to runoff and soil loss were around 90 8 and 89 8 respectively in the two 50 mm h 1 treatments 1 and 2 and about 73 6 in the 100 mm h 1 treatment 3 rainfall accounted for the remaining 10 runoff and soil loss upslope and lateral inflow had different contributions to total runoff rate and soil loss separately lateral inflow contributions to total runoff and soil loss were from 10 2 to 13 5 and from 8 8 to 11 1 respectively while upslope inflow contributions to total runoff and soil loss were 62 3 77 8 and 64 7 81 0 this result showed that upslope inflow induced a greater contribution to runoff and soil loss than lateral inflow which only contributed around 10 the total area being simulated was 784 m2 in which rainfall was applied to only 2 whereas lateral and upslope inflow were simulated for 16 3 and 81 6 respectively thus lateral inflow contributions were less than the area represented whereas rainfall contributions were greater than the area represented 4 discussion 4 1 interaction between eg morphology and flow path changes fig 6 shows rill and eg channel flow paths changes at different eg development stages topography changes can lead to eg flow path variations while flow path directions can also influence the eg erosion processes thus interactions between eg morphology and flow path changes still need clarification during the eg development process at the beginning stage the original land surface appeared smooth but subtle dendritic flow paths existed on the surface these micro topography changes fostered convergence of sheet flow and initiation of rill erosion which can lead to alterations in flow paths fig 6a and 6b once headcutting developed connectivity within the eg main channel it became fixed in place and promoted the connectivity to the channel poesen et al 2003 lateral inflow added to the formation of relatively fixed rill flow paths on both sides of the main eg channel which tended to decrease the total flow path length and branching of rills fig 6b by the end of the experiment a permanent eg main channel formed as disconnected headcuts were linked together the major lateral rill flow paths guided runoff and sediment to this main eg channel total length and branches of flow paths were both decreased due to channel annexation fig 6c upslope inflow transported the sediment through the eg channel while lateral inflow transported runoff and sediment through the lateral rills developed into eg tributaries later and eg channel it is clear in fig 6 that the eg system provides enhanced linkages from upland and lateral slopes for transferring runoff and sediment poesen et al 2003 thus eg flow paths changes can be used to explain the upslope and lateral inflow impacts on soil erosion in the eg system 4 2 lateral inflow contributions xu et al 2017 demonstrated how upslope inflow played an important role in eg erosion this study confirmed the significance of upslope inflow and showed that it can over ride the contribution of lateral inflow upslope inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss were around 80 when rainfall intensity was at 50 mm h 1 and more than 60 of total runoff and soil loss when rainfall intensity increased to 100 mm h 1 this result verified that upslope inflow is the main controlling factor for eg erosion in surface flow dominated eg systems while in other conditions subsurface flow side bank erosion and within gully shear stress might be the main contributor to the soil loss zegeye et al 2018 the question could be asked if the lateral inflow only contributes around 10 to total runoff and soil loss is it still valuable for understanding eg erosion the answer seems to be certain that lateral inflow is still important for runoff and sediment connectivity of the eg system with interrill areas the extensive imbrication of the interrill areas by lateral rills connected to the main channel is likely one reason why the rainfall contribution exceeded its proportional area in an eg system upslope inflow mainly contributes to the growth of the main eg channel but both lateral and upslope inflow play critical roles in generating rill networks and providing connectivity of interrill areas for runoff and sediment delivery to the main channel rill networks on lateral slopes collect sheet flows from interrill areas and provide linkages to the main eg channel for the eg system that developed in this study nearly all runoff and sediment was transported through the eg main channel as more than 95 of the total runoff and sediment was collected by the middle 30 cm wide collector fig 1a lateral inflow was not only important in the formation of lateral rills that provide landscape connectivity but also contributes to the imbricated landform formation process gong et al 2011 which has generally been overlooked in previous research more works need to be done on the lateral inflow contributions to clarify how lateral inflow induces land surface morphologic changes and runoff connectivity enhancement 4 3 flow hydrodynamic characteristics in eg channel and on lateral slopes spatial distributions of flow hydrodynamic characteristics both in eg channel and on lateral slopes were displayed under the rain upslope inflow lateral inflow condition in the 15 and 50 mm h 1 treatment which is the condition most similar to the field hydrological condition for overland flow from both directions fig 7 in the eg channel flow velocities increased as the slope length increased and the largest flow velocity was 0 38 m s 1 obtained at 7 m of slope length flow shear stress and stream power fluctuated along the eg channel which peaked at 5 m of slope length as 10 4 n m 2 and 3 4 n m 1 s 1 on lateral slopes the flow velocity did not linearly vary along the slope which could be attributed to the dominance of sheet flow before rill networks developed on the lateral side slopes after rill became connected on the slope surface runoff by rainfall and lateral inflow was able to merge and form tributaries to the main eg channel compared with the flow hydrodynamic characteristics in the eg channel flow shear stress and stream power on lateral slopes were extremely smaller at all slope positions representing great differences in erosive force and energy of runoff zhang et al 2014 the spatially averaged shear stress and stream power in the eg channel were 4 9 8 6 times higher than those on lateral slopes similarly upslope and lateral inflow contributions to total soil loss were about 70 and 10 respectively table 2 which was consistent with the result of flow hydrodynamic differences the results suggest that in a surface flow dominated eg system the difference between contributions of upslope and lateral inflows was induced by the differences in flow hydrodynamic characteristics in the eg channel and on lateral slopes 4 4 soil particle size distribution changes in eg channel and on lateral slopes the significance of the rills and eg tributaries of the lateral side slopes is seen in changes in the particle size distribution psd in the eg channel and on lateral slopes from before and after experiments xu et al 2006 showed how soil quality changes due to changes in particle size distribution in response to management they reasoned that this was due to erosion being a selective process with respect to psd in that some areas will be enriched in sand sizes and others in clay size particles depending upon their landscape position rhoton et al 1979 compared with the soil textures before the tests the clay 0 002 mm and fine silt 0 002 0 02 mm contents following the treatments imposed all decreased table 3 in contrasts the coarse silt 0 02 0 05 mm and fine sand 0 25 mm contents increased coarse sand contents were all less than 1 varying from 0 04 to 0 37 total contents of clay and fine silt 0 02 mm after the erosion experiment decreased from 42 5 to 31 8 36 0 across all erosion treatments and positions while total contents of coarse silt and fine sand 0 02 0 25 mm after the experiments increased from 57 4 to 64 0 68 1 across all erosion treatments and positions in the eg system raindrop splash and surface runoff detachment are highly associated with size selectivity of eroded sediment shi et al 2012 2013 wang et al 2014 during the rainfall and inflow stage fine particles were much easier to be transported while coarse particles were relatively harder to be transported the deposition or lack of suspension of sands induced a coarsening of soil left on the slope surface and in channels differences in psd between the eg main channel and the lateral slope soils were minor table 3 this can be attributed to the eg system providing a highly connected erosion system through which surface sediment was transported without being transport limited to illustrate the spatially distributed erosion impacts on the soil psd the percentages of the various size particles changed as a function of slope length in response to the different treatments as shown in fig 8 in treatment 1 15 and 50 mm h 1 coarse silt and fine sand particle contents were a little larger in the eg channel while clay and fine silt contents were correspondingly smaller in the eg channel compared with lateral slopes fig 8a and 8b on the lateral slopes coarse silt and fine sand contents showed fluctuations along the slope length and were larger than the contents in the original soil this could be attributed to the coarser particles being harder to detach and transport to the outlet conversely fine silt and clay contents at different slope positions were all under 20 illustrating that more fine silt and clay particles were transported to the outlet during the experiment compared with the fluctuation range of soil particle contents on the lateral slopes the fluctuation range in the eg channel was larger which was related to the serious erosion that included mass failures of sidewalls and random temporary deposition in treatment 2 20 and 50 mm h 1 soil particle contents also showed a fluctuation trend along the slope length on lateral slopes fine sand and coarse silt contents showed a complementary relationship as both contents were larger than those in original soil in contrasts clay and fine silt contents were smaller than those before experiments fig 8c in the eg channel the fluctuation range was wider than on lateral slopes fig 8d compared with fluctuation range of soil particle contents in 15 slope treatment the fluctuation in the 20 slope treatments showed a wider range slope gradient increment increased the detachment randomness of soil particles which might be a reason for higher fluctuation in treatment 3 20 and 100 mm h 1 treatment soil particle contents on the lateral slopes exhibited small fluctuations from 1 m to 6 m of slope length at the 7 m of slope length coarse silt content dramatically increased while fine sand content decreased fig 8e this could be related to raindrop splash dominated at this location because of less surface runoff at the downslope area compared with lateral slopes coarse particle content decreased while fine particles increased fig 8f this is the result of larger runoff energy flushing sediment readily through the eg channel compared with rills on lateral slopes foster 1986 wang and shi 2015 4 5 limitations of this experimental study this study quantified how upslope and lateral inflows influence soil loss in a typical ephemeral gully system on the loess plateau this study addresses the current research gap related to the upslope and lateral inflow impacts on flow hydrodynamics and soil degradation in an eg system especially lateral inflow contributions to the runoff connectivity of the eg system through the formation of lateral rills but the inflow applied in this study was clear water for both lateral and upslope directions in field conditions overland flow from both upslope drainage area and lateral slopes will be sediment laden flow due to its detachment and consequently transport downstream compared with clear water inflow upslope and lateral inflow with different sediment concentrations would cause less soil loss in the ephemeral gully system tested because of transport capacity and detachment capacity limitations ellison 1948 zheng et al 2000 liu et al 2019 future studies should concentrate on the impacts of upslope and lateral sediment laden flows on ephemeral gully erosion wu et al 2019 this study demonstrated the eg erosion processes influenced by overland flow however subsurface flow from both upslope and lateral directions could also produce instabilities leading to further bank erosion and headcut development wilson 2011 zegeye et al 2018 future laboratory experiments or field investigation on quantifying these processes are also needed the specific size of the drainage areas above the eg and on the lateral slopes are highly variable and will lead to different inflow rates and subsequently different contribution results while such results are situation dependent and spatially variable upslope and lateral inflows in this study were based upon typical morphologic features i e contributing areas of the loess plateau thus the results are situation dependent and spatially variable but the understanding gained of inflow contributions to the hydrologic connectivity and soil degradation of the eg system in this study is widely applicable soil degradation by coarsening the soil with eg system development can contribute to loss of productivity as observed in the black soil region of china liu et al 2013 and other areas like in italy ollobarren et al 2016 5 conclusions simulated rainfall and inflow experiments that concentrated on quantifying upslope and lateral inflows impact on eg erosion were conducted the following results were observed 1 upslope inflow was the dominant 70 80 contributor to total runoff and soil loss while contributions of lateral inflow to total runoff and soil loss were only around 10 and rainfall contributed the other 10 20 2 lateral inflow was not only important in the formation of lateral rills contributing to runoff connectivity but also contributed to the development of an imbricated landform pattern and the lateral gradient of the hillslope 3 the spatial averaged shear stress and stream power in the eg main channel were 4 9 8 6 times those on lateral slopes which explained the contribution differences of upslope and lateral inflows 4 surface concentrated flow and sheet flow in the eg system shifted the soil particle size distribution to be coarser as soil particles lager than 0 02 mm increased by 12 6 averagely as most eg systems are related to farmland and pastures the eg erosion is a vital influencing factor in farmland and pasture soil degradation processes which needs further research this work demonstrates the critical need of preventing both upslope and lateral drainage contributions to eg channels to protect valuable soil resources from degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

6080,overland flow through an ephemeral gully eg system integrates flow from upslope areas and lateral side slopes lateral overland inflow creates tributaries to the main eg channel for runoff and sediment discharge which exacerbates the eg erosion and local soil degradation however research concerning tributary formation by overland flow especially contributions of overland upslope and lateral inflows to eg erosion are still lacking thus simulated rainfall and inflow experiments under two erosive rainfall intensities 50 and 100 mm h 1 and two typical slope gradients 15 and 20 were conducted under representative lateral and upslope overland inflow conditions using an 8 m long 2 m wide and 0 6 m deep soil pan the results showed that upslope and lateral inflow both contributed to the runoff connectivity of the eg channel and lateral rills in the eg system for these simulated conditions upslope inflow contributions to total runoff and soil loss were 62 78 and 65 81 respectively while lateral inflow only contributed around 10 the contribution differences could be attributed to flow hydrodynamic characteristics in that shear stress and stream power in the eg channel were 4 9 8 6 times greater than those on the lateral slopes lateral inflow was important to lateral rill formation which contributed to imbricated landform and lateral gradient formation process and consequently promoted runoff and sediment connectivity of the eg system soil erosion induced by concentrated flow in channels and sheet flow in interill areas coarsened soil textures soil particles lager than 0 02 mm increased 12 6 on average which may contribute to reduction of local soil productivity this work demonstrates the critical need of preventing both upslope and lateral drainage into eg channels keywords ephemeral gully tributaries flow hydrodynamics concentrated flow rill erosion flow path soil texture 1 introduction ephemeral gullies egs are small channels eroded by concentrated flow that can be easily filled by normal tillage only to be reformed again in the same location soil science society of america 2008 zheng et al 2017 this definition agrees with those for shallow gully erosion proposed by zhu 1956 and mega rill erosion proposed by foster 1986 while the eg term still needs some clarification egs tend to have two opposite lateral side slopes and an upper contributing area capra and la spada 2015 surface runoff induces concentrated flow along the thalweg of rills or micro depressions which initiates headcuts and the formation of an eg main channel with time runoff on lateral side slopes concentrates in rills that feed the eg main channel and these lateral rills develop into eg branches which can be fed by newly formed rills in previous interrill areas eg main channel eg branches and rills are organized with time into a fully developed eg network such an eg network increases the hydrologic connectivity of the landscape poesen et al 2003 while also dissecting the landscape into an imbricated landform zhu 1956 gong et al 2011 capra et al 2009 used eg system to represent the whole of the main branch eg channel and the interconnected tributaries of an eg to study rainfall characteristics impact on eg erosion thus eg systems can be used as an integration of the entire network contributing to eg channels capra et al 2011 capra 2013 whatever the definition is eg systems can be the dominant sediment source in agricultural watersheds previous studies conducted in u s mediterranean region of western europe australia loess plateau and the mollisol region of china all showed that egs contribute the majority of total soil loss and the contribution rate can even reach up to 100 casalí et al 1999 bennett et al 2000a wijdenes et al 2000 poesen et al 2003 hancock and evans 2006 cheng et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 porto et al 2014 capra and la spada 2015 given the high soil loss eg erosion leads to soil degradation and crop productivity loss liu et al 2013 the reoccurrence over time of rainfall induced overland flow removing large amounts of soil from the eg system and mechanical tillage operations filling the eroded channels with adjacent surface soil materials can greatly exacerbate the soil losses from an eg system nachtergaele et al 2001 gordon et al 2008 these two cyclical events lead to the decline of both topsoil depth liu et al 2013 and soil quality from lateral slopes adjacent to the eg xu et al 2016 ollobarren et al 2016 wilson et al 2018 ollobarren et al 2016 observed the soil quality index sqi in an eg system in central sicily and found the lowest sqi inside of the eg channel and in the nearby areas xu et al 2016 compared the soil physicochemical properties in eg bottom and inter gully areas and found the soil physical quality properties were predominately degraded in the first stage of eg erosion in subsequent stages of eg erosion soil chemical quality i e nutrient losses dominated the soil degradation hydrologic processes like rainfall capra et al 2009 han et al 2017 overland flow and subsurface flow tebebu et al 2010 wilson 2011 wilson et al 2015 frankl et al 2016 zegeye et al 2018 are the main drivers contributing to the formation and development of egs there are numerous subprocesses included e g particle detachment by shear forces headcutting bennett et al 2000b hosseinalizadeh

gully side walls zegeye et al 2018 in an eg system driven by surface flow that is mainly discussed in this paper overland inflow can be divided into upslope inflow and lateral inflow upslope inflow is generated from the contributing area above the eg headcut below the watershed boundary line lateral inflow is generated from both sides of the channel by concentrated flow in rills as well as sheet flow from interrill areas upslope inflow is related to the upslope drainage topography soil properties and rainfall characteristics casalí et al 1999 cheng et al 2007 gutiérrez et al 2009 capra and la spada 2015 zegeye et al 2016 xu et al 2017 upslope inflow can significantly increase the runoff velocity shear stress and energy of flows through the eg channel and hence the eg erosion magnitude wu et al 2004 2019 gong et al 2011 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 conducted controlled laboratory experiments and found that runoff velocities were 23 79 larger with upslope inflow than without and upslope inflow was more effective than rainfall at increasing runoff and soil erosion wu et al 2019 used a series of field rainfall simulation experiments to investigate different inflow and sediment conditions impact on the eg erosion and found that flow velocities in eg channels were greater than those on the lateral slopes and sediment concentration increase had a limited effect on the runoff velocities in the eg channel given the typical concave topography of eg systems in which the main channel lies in the bottom of a swale with two lateral side slopes interconnected tributaries of lateral inflow channels can also be the main source of runoff and sediment contributing to the eg erosion and local soil degradation when an eg system develops however studies that combine upslope and lateral inflows are essentially nonexistent and their interactions are not well understood or described especially on steep slope landforms like the loess plateau where eg systems are widely distributed soil particle size distribution can reflect the size selectivity of erosion which has great significance on understanding soil erosion and degradation processes shi et al 2012 wang and shi 2015 found that sediment became coarser after rills developed because of increases in flow depth and runoff energy however changes in the soil particle size distribution within the eg systems are still not clear former studies on egs induced soil physical property changes are usually based on ground truth surveys of fields combined with laboratory analysis of soil samples ollobarren et al 2016 xu et al 2016 few studies have been done to demonstrate erosion selectivity as an eg system develops in response to concentrated flow therefore a series of laboratory rainfall and inflow experiments were conducted under different slope gradients rainfall intensities upslope and lateral inflow conditions to quantify how upslope and lateral inflows affect eg erosion the specific objectives were 1 to discriminate the contributions of upslope and lateral overland inflows to the runoff and soil loss rates in an eg system 2 to understand lateral rill flow contributions to runoff connectivity of an eg system 3 to quantify the flow hydrodynamic characteristics in eg system and 4 to investigate the eg erosion impacts on soil particle size distribution changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the same side sprinkler rainfall simulator system was used as xu et al 2017 which provided spatial uniformity of rainfall and terminal velocity raindrop diameters were calibrated by laser precipitation monitor mode 5 4110 10 200 adolf thies gmbh co kg göttingen germany varying from 0 2 to 3 8 mm a slope adjustable soil pan was used to conduct the simulation experiments which is 8 m long 2 m wide and 0 6 m deep there are many drainage holes at the bottom with 2 cm aperture at the upper end of the soil pan an overflow tank was set to simulate the inflow from an upper contributing area in the field gravel was glued on the rigid floor connecting the tank and soil bed which decreased the flow energy entering the soil bed and acted as baffle structure fig 1 a 1b before each experiment upslope inflow discharge was adjusted by intake valves and calibrated li et al 2016 lateral inflow to both sides of the soil pan was applied by flexible pipes with holes every 10 cm along the pipe the inner diameter of the pipe was 12 mm and the diameter of each hole was 2 mm the lateral inflow pipe on each side of the soil pan supplied inflow under a constant head onto a waterproof plate on both sides of the soil pans one end of the waterproof plate was attached to the sidewall and buried in the soil bed while the other end was extended 20 cm away from the soil pan sidewall the angle between the extended plate and horizontal plane was 20 which was a typical angle of lateral slopes in eg systems on the loess plateau these two plates were covered with permeable cloth to allow the lateral inflow to spread uniformly when it entered the soil bed fig 1c lateral inflow discharge was calibrated before each test and lateral pipes were set up and removed easily within a short time during the experiments which made it possible to shift lateral inflow conditions in order to separately collect runoff and sediment samples from the eg channel and lateral slopes during each run three triangular runoff and sediment collecting devices were installed at the lower end of soil pan fig 1a the triangular runoff collector in the middle was 40 cm high which was coupled with a 30 cm deep end plate the end plate was downward adjustable from the initial soil surface to 30 cm below the initial surface during the experiment as the eg developed this was to avoid sediment deposition at the outlet of the soil pan as the eg channel developed the width of the middle collector was 30 cm that is the typical eg width during experiments two 85 cm wide runoff collectors were installed on the two sides of the main channel these collectors were fixed in place and installed at the initial soil bed surface 2 2 soil bed preparation soil materials used was loess soil 16 1 sand 61 5 silt 22 4 clay calcic cambisols usda taxonomy and the detailed soil characteristics and preprocessing procedures were the same as described in xu et al 2017 when packing the soil bed a 5 cm sand layer was first settled at bottom for free drainage then 25 cm plow pan and 20 cm tillage layer were packed in 5 cm increments detailed packing procedures can be found in xu et al 2017 an initial eg channel was built on soil bed surface according to the topographic characteristics of natural egs gong et al 2011 in this study a curved plank was used to make this initial eg channel fig 1 and the maximum depth of the pre formed channel was about 12 cm after forming the initial eg channel manual tillage was applied to a depth of approximately 20 cm along the contour line using a shovel this procedure was intended to simulate the natural cropland tillage practice in early april before the rainy season in the loess plateau 2 3 experimental design high intensity and short duration rainstorms frequently occur in the loess plateau during the summer causing severe soil loss gully growth and related natural hazards wei et al 2007 han et al 2017 based on the erosive rainfall standard i 5 1 52 mm min 1 about 91 2 mm h 1 on the loess plateau two representative rainfall intensities 50 and 100 mm h 1 were used in this study zhou and wang 1987 egs are widely distributed on 15 35 hillslopes on the loess plateau therefore two typical slope gradients 15 and 20 were used in this study jiang et al 1999 three treatments were conducted to compare eg erosion under different slope gradients and rainfall intensities treatment 1 was 15 slope and 50 mm h 1 rainfall intensity treatment 2 was 20 slope and 50 mm h 1rainfall and treatment 3 was 20 slope and 100 mm h 1 rainfall each treatment was replicated twice upslope and lateral inflow discharges were designed according to the eg system morphology observed on the loess plateau zhang et al 1991 cheng et al 2007 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 1991 reported that the lateral distance between adjacent egs was about 16 m on average and the critical slope length for the initiation of egs was about 40 m thus for 8 m long soil bed the lateral drainage area was approximately 128 m2 while upslope drainage area was 640 m2 thus the lateral and upslope inflow rates used were 8 and 40 l min 1 respectively under typical rainfall intensity after applying the runoff coefficient observed in the research region wei et al 2007 upslope inflow discharge was about five times larger than lateral inflow rate because of the differences in drainage areas to discriminate the contributions of upslope and lateral inflow to eg erosion a series of experimental stages with and without upslope and lateral inflow were conducted table 1 a total of four stages were included in each run the first stage only rain stage i was used to test the rainfall induced soil erosion the second stage rain lateral inflow stage ii was to acquire the lateral inflow impact followed by a check of rainfall induced soil erosion at this stage in the third stage rain upslope inflow stage iii upslope inflow was added to test its impact while eliminating the lateral inflow component this was followed again by a check on rainfall induced erosion for this stage at the fourth stage rain upslope inflow lateral inflow stage iv upslope and lateral inflow were both applied to test their combined impacts on soil loss then soil erosion rates under lateral inflow applied while eliminating upslope inflow condition and rain only condition were checked when calculating inflow contribution rain induced runoff and soil loss in each stage stage ii iii iv was first calculated by interpolating the values in nearby rain only conditions as 1 r ri r i 1 r i 2 s ri s i 1 s i 2 where rri and s ri are the rain induced runoff and soil loss at stage i i ii iii iv ri and si are the runoff and soil loss rate of only rain treatment at stage i i ii iii iv for stage ii lateral inflow and iii upslope inflow the contribution of inflow from each individual source was calculated as the combined rainfall plus inflow measurement minus the contribution of rain only part for stage iv when upslope and lateral inflow were both applied with rainfall contribution of each inflow component was calculated as 2 r c l r r l r riv r r l 100 s c l s r l s riv s r l 100 r c u l r r u l r riv r r u l 100 s c u l s r u l s riv s r u l 100 r c u r c u l r c l s c u s c u l s c l where rcl rcu l rcu scl scu l scu are the runoff and soil loss contributions from the lateral inflow the sum of upslope and lateral inflow and the upslope inflow respectively rr l rr u l sr l s r u l are runoff and soil loss rate of rain lateral inflow and rain upslope inflow lateral inflow treatments at stage iv 2 4 experimental procedure a flowchart of experiments is shown in fig 2 pre soak rain with 30 mm h 1 rainfall intensity was conducted to decrease spatial variations of surface soil moisture and roughness conditions xu et al 2017 before each experiment rainfall intensity and inflow rates were calibrated to target values spatial uniformity of rainfall intensity was over 90 that met the requirements the soil pan was then adjusted to the tested slope and exposed to the prescribed rainfall intensity and inflow rate upslope and lateral inflows were applied or removed by following the treatment conditions listed in table 1 for the different stages once runoff reached an equilibrium rate runoff rate variation smaller than 10 average value in different stages which usually took about 1 2 min runoff and sediment samples were collected continuously in 15 l buckets at the outlets every 1 2 min the duration from adjusting boundary hydrological condition to equilibrium stage would vary a little bit because of different slope degree and rainfall intensity but all treatments were completed within 55 60 min making treatments comparable the number of samples in each stage is listed in table 1 the runoff samples were weighed immediately and then sediment settling and decanting were conducted at last all sediment samples were dried at 105 c and weighed for further calculation during experiments a leica nova ms50 total station laser scanner leica geosystems ag heerbrugg switzerland was used to monitor the morphology changes as the eg system developed the scanning resolution was 1 cm 1 cm which was high enough for analysis of eg morphology and tracking flow path changes acquired point cloud data were first denoised and unified in the cyclone 6 0 software and then imported into arcgis 10 4 to form dems then flow paths were extracted by hydrologic analysis module in spatial analysis tools the processing steps for generating stream networks include identifying sinks determining flow directions and calculating flow accumulations wu et al 2018 flow accumulation threshold was set as 150 to reflect all rills on the slope surface qin et al 2018b overland flow velocities in eg channel and on lateral slopes were measured at four slope positions 1 3 5 7 m of slope length along the soil bed by kmno4 dye tracer method with three replicates at each point flow depth was measured perpendicularly to the surface using a thin ruler and read to 0 1 mm precision 2 5 flow hydrodynamic characteristics depth averaged flow velocity v was calculated based on the surface velocity v s measured during the experiment as 3 v k v s where k is the coefficient that is 0 67 for laminar flow and 0 8 for turbulent flow horton et al 1934 emmett 1970 li et al 1996 generally lateral overland flow is dominated by laminar flow while flow in eg channel is turbulent flow thus mean flow velocities at different positions were calculated using different coefficients shear stress reflected runoff energies to deliver the mass in runoff and was calculated as 4 τ γ r j where τ is shear stress pa γ is the specific weight of water n m 3 r is hydraulic radius calculated by flow depth m j is surface slope m m 1 calculated as the sine of the slope degree as the bed slope and channel slope would be different at various spatial positions through the experiment dems acquired from scanned point clouds at corresponding moments of the experiment were used to get the average slope degree values of the measured flow paths stream power representing the expenditure of the power of water per unit area was calculated as nearing et al 1991 5 ω τ v where ω is stream power n m 1 s 1 2 6 soil particle size distribution analysis in order to compare soil particle size distributions before and after eg erosion soil samples were collected both in eg channel and on lateral slope surfaces at 1 m increments from 1 to 7 m slope length to evaluate soil degradation by soil erosion soil samples on the lateral slope surfaces were collected 0 5 m away from the eg channel a pipette method was used in this study for particle size analysis before testing soil samples were pre processed to remove organic matter and disperse clays soil samples were first air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve then 6 h2o2 and 0 2 mol l 1 hcl were used to eliminate organic matter and carbonate respectively 0 05 mol l 1 hcl and distilled water were used to wash out ca2 and cl then 0 5 mol l 1 naoh was added and the solution allowed to stand overnight after stirring eshel et al 2004 at last the solution was dispersed by using ultrasonic mixing 160 w 10 15 min after the pre processing 10 g soil samples were weighed for pipette analysis 3 results 3 1 eg development processes fig 3 shows a typical eg system developing and the morphological changes associated with the experimental stages with rainfall upslope inflow and lateral inflow applied at different stages the ephemeral gully and rills developed over time the 100 mm h 1 and 20 treatment is presented as an example of the overland flow impacts on ephemeral gully development at the beginning of stage i when only rainfall was applied fig 3a sheet flow from lateral slopes gradually concentrated into the pre formed eg channel from both sides according to the pre formed topography as such sheet erosion was dominant at this stage during stage ii lateral inflow combined with rainfall induced concentrated flow along the lateral slopes as well as in eg channel convergent flow within the eg channel initiated headcutting of the eg main channel fig 3b lateral slopes of the eg system during stage ii gradually formed fixed flow paths and rill erosion started to dominate the soil erosion process in stage iii upslope inflow into the eg main channel resulted in disconnected headcuts fig 3c and then became connected to form a well defined eg channel fig 3d in stage iv the addition of lateral inflow to rainfall and upslope inflow quickly resulted in connectivity of lateral rills with the main channel fig 3e these rill tributaries to the main channel occurred on both lateral side slopes and resulted in rapid widening of the eg main channel as stage iv progressed the eg channel depth increased and rills on lateral slopes became eg tributaries that themselves had rill branches thereby forming a complete eg system fig 3f it was the synergistic effects of rainfall upslope inflow and lateral inflow that led to the progressive rill and ephemeral gully erosion that produced the eg system and excessive soil loss 3 2 runoff and soil loss responses to different inflow conditions 3 2 1 runoff responses runoff processes responded to the inflow conditions as expected fig 4 as rainfall continued in stage i the runoff rate increased with time when lateral inflow was added to rainfall in stage ii the runoff rate jumped up particularly for the higher rainfall and slope condition when rainfall was combined with upslope inflow in stage iii the runoff rate jumped up even higher despite the formation of rills and a well connected eg main channel the runoff dropped back down to the previous rainfall only runoff rate when all three sources were contributing in stage iv the runoff rate jumped up to slightly higher than stage iii due to the addition of lateral inflow but then dropped down significantly in stage iv when upslope inflow ceased for the 50 mm h 1 rainfall intensity runoff rates in the 20 treatment treatment 2 were slightly larger 4 than those in 15 treatment treatment 1 when only rainfall was applied with means of 2 16 and 2 25 l min 1 table 2 respectively however when rainfall intensity increased to 100 mm h 1 treatment 3 the runoff rate averaged 9 79 l min 1 and was 2 2 3 8 times larger than those in treatments 1 and 2 respectively this was the result of excess infiltration runoff induced by the larger rainfall intensity wei et al 2007 xu et al 2017 when lateral inflow was applied at stage ii table 2 runoff rates were significantly increased compared with stage i rainfall only the runoff rate increased by 298 353 and 214 for treatments 1 2 and 3 50 mm h 1 rainfall intensity for the 15 and 20 slopes and 100 mm h 1 rainfall intensity for the 20 slope respectively the subsequent runoff rates for rainfall alone were all larger than those at stage i by 144 178 and 166 respectively this can be attributed to the saturation of soil and development of rills providing flow path connectivity on lateral slopes when upslope inflow was added to this rainfall condition stage iii the runoff rates increased by more than an order of magnitude 1163 and 1274 for treatments 1 and 2 respectively but only by 292 for treatment 3 runoff rates under the three treatments varied from 64 0 to 68 9 l min 1 from 83 2 to 88 4 l min 1 and from 99 4 to 104 4 l min 1 respectively while the eg and lateral rills were substantially more developed at this stage compared to stage ii the rainfall only prior to stage iii was essentially the same as following stage iii similarly for stage iv rain upslope inflow lateral inflow the runoff rates increased about the same as in stage iii 1445 1354 and 282 for treatments 1 2 and 3 respectively under these three treatments runoff rates varied from 77 2 to 83 5 l min 1 from 89 3 to 95 3 l min 1 and from 107 6 to 112 9 l min 1 respectively when upslope inflow was removed the runoff rates obviously decreased fig 4 however runoff rates for rainfall plus lateral inflow at stage iv were 215 203 and 72 larger for the three treatments respectively than for this same condition at stage ii varying from 16 3 to 20 1 l min 1 from 18 7 to 22 7 l min 1 and from 40 7 to 43 2 l min 1 respectively 3 2 2 soil loss responses soil loss rates exhibited similar patterns as the runoff responses figs 4 and 5 at the beginning when only rain was applied soil loss rate was low and slightly increased with time as for runoff soil loss rate jumped when lateral flow was included then jumped even higher when upslope inflow was added and dropped back down between each stage when rainfall alone was applied the main differences between runoff and soil loss responses was the influencing degree the inflow impact on soil loss was greater than that on runoff alone for stage i when slope for the 50 mm h 1 rainfall intensity was increased from 15 to 20 the soil loss rate increased by 55 table 2 however when rainfall intensity for 20 slope was increased from 50 mm h 1 to 100 mm h 1 the soil loss rate increased by 500 varying from 1 5 to 4 8 kg min 1 the addition of lateral inflow in stage ii increased soil loss rates by 966 715 and 293 over rainfall alone for treatments 1 2 and 3 respectively soil loss in stage ii was dominated by rill erosion on the lateral slopes for treatments 1 and 2 and by ephemeral gully head advance and rill development for treatment 3 in response to higher rainfall intensity after lateral inflow was terminated and runoff was generated by rainfall alone soil loss rates decreased substantially but were still 521 412 and 229 greater for treatments 1 2 and 3 respectively than those in stage i for rainfall only thus the effects of soil wetting up and rill occurrence were more dramatic on soil loss than runoff in stage iii rain upslope inflow soil loss rates for the three treatments increased by 1412 1244 and 303 over the previous rainfall alone this is a greater increase than observed for runoff when upslope inflow was subsequently terminated soil loss rates went back down to essentially the same level as before upslope inflow following stage ii despite the better flow path connectivity for stage iv rain upslope inflow lateral inflow soil loss rates for the three treatments were 41 7 44 2 kg min 1 45 4 49 7 kg min 1 and 53 7 59 2 kg min 1 respectively this is higher than all other hydrologic conditions and is a larger increase from stage iii to iv 1938 1463 and 319 for treatments 1 2 3 respectively than observed for runoff when upslope inflow and lateral inflow were eliminated soil loss rates in treatments 1 and 2 were more than double what they were after stage ii and iii but only slightly higher for treatment 3 3 3 discrimination of upslope and lateral inflow contributions to eg erosion the contributions of upslope and lateral inflow were discriminated for all treatments and hydrologic conditions under the rain lateral inflow condition lateral inflow contributions to slope surface runoff and soil loss were influenced by rainfall intensity lateral inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss varied from 56 7 to 58 3 and from 62 5 to 66 2 respectively for treatments 1 and 2 thus when slope gradient increased the lateral inflow contributions did not change much when rainfall intensity increased from 50 to 100 mm h 1 lateral inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss decreased to 41 7 and 45 4 respectively under the rain upslope inflow condition upslope inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss varied from 92 2 to 92 7 and from 92 5 to 93 8 respectively for treatments 1 and 2 thus an increase of slope gradient from 15 to 20 had no effect on upslope inflow induced runoff and soil loss when rainfall intensity increased from 50 mm h 1 to 100 mm h 1 upslope inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss decreased to 73 0 and 73 3 which is to be expected since upslope inflow rate was not adjusted and held constant while the rainfall intensity increased under the rain upslope inflow lateral inflow condition upslope inflow plus lateral inflow total contributions to runoff and soil loss were around 90 8 and 89 8 respectively in the two 50 mm h 1 treatments 1 and 2 and about 73 6 in the 100 mm h 1 treatment 3 rainfall accounted for the remaining 10 runoff and soil loss upslope and lateral inflow had different contributions to total runoff rate and soil loss separately lateral inflow contributions to total runoff and soil loss were from 10 2 to 13 5 and from 8 8 to 11 1 respectively while upslope inflow contributions to total runoff and soil loss were 62 3 77 8 and 64 7 81 0 this result showed that upslope inflow induced a greater contribution to runoff and soil loss than lateral inflow which only contributed around 10 the total area being simulated was 784 m2 in which rainfall was applied to only 2 whereas lateral and upslope inflow were simulated for 16 3 and 81 6 respectively thus lateral inflow contributions were less than the area represented whereas rainfall contributions were greater than the area represented 4 discussion 4 1 interaction between eg morphology and flow path changes fig 6 shows rill and eg channel flow paths changes at different eg development stages topography changes can lead to eg flow path variations while flow path directions can also influence the eg erosion processes thus interactions between eg morphology and flow path changes still need clarification during the eg development process at the beginning stage the original land surface appeared smooth but subtle dendritic flow paths existed on the surface these micro topography changes fostered convergence of sheet flow and initiation of rill erosion which can lead to alterations in flow paths fig 6a and 6b once headcutting developed connectivity within the eg main channel it became fixed in place and promoted the connectivity to the channel poesen et al 2003 lateral inflow added to the formation of relatively fixed rill flow paths on both sides of the main eg channel which tended to decrease the total flow path length and branching of rills fig 6b by the end of the experiment a permanent eg main channel formed as disconnected headcuts were linked together the major lateral rill flow paths guided runoff and sediment to this main eg channel total length and branches of flow paths were both decreased due to channel annexation fig 6c upslope inflow transported the sediment through the eg channel while lateral inflow transported runoff and sediment through the lateral rills developed into eg tributaries later and eg channel it is clear in fig 6 that the eg system provides enhanced linkages from upland and lateral slopes for transferring runoff and sediment poesen et al 2003 thus eg flow paths changes can be used to explain the upslope and lateral inflow impacts on soil erosion in the eg system 4 2 lateral inflow contributions xu et al 2017 demonstrated how upslope inflow played an important role in eg erosion this study confirmed the significance of upslope inflow and showed that it can over ride the contribution of lateral inflow upslope inflow contributions to runoff and soil loss were around 80 when rainfall intensity was at 50 mm h 1 and more than 60 of total runoff and soil loss when rainfall intensity increased to 100 mm h 1 this result verified that upslope inflow is the main controlling factor for eg erosion in surface flow dominated eg systems while in other conditions subsurface flow side bank erosion and within gully shear stress might be the main contributor to the soil loss zegeye et al 2018 the question could be asked if the lateral inflow only contributes around 10 to total runoff and soil loss is it still valuable for understanding eg erosion the answer seems to be certain that lateral inflow is still important for runoff and sediment connectivity of the eg system with interrill areas the extensive imbrication of the interrill areas by lateral rills connected to the main channel is likely one reason why the rainfall contribution exceeded its proportional area in an eg system upslope inflow mainly contributes to the growth of the main eg channel but both lateral and upslope inflow play critical roles in generating rill networks and providing connectivity of interrill areas for runoff and sediment delivery to the main channel rill networks on lateral slopes collect sheet flows from interrill areas and provide linkages to the main eg channel for the eg system that developed in this study nearly all runoff and sediment was transported through the eg main channel as more than 95 of the total runoff and sediment was collected by the middle 30 cm wide collector fig 1a lateral inflow was not only important in the formation of lateral rills that provide landscape connectivity but also contributes to the imbricated landform formation process gong et al 2011 which has generally been overlooked in previous research more works need to be done on the lateral inflow contributions to clarify how lateral inflow induces land surface morphologic changes and runoff connectivity enhancement 4 3 flow hydrodynamic characteristics in eg channel and on lateral slopes spatial distributions of flow hydrodynamic characteristics both in eg channel and on lateral slopes were displayed under the rain upslope inflow lateral inflow condition in the 15 and 50 mm h 1 treatment which is the condition most similar to the field hydrological condition for overland flow from both directions fig 7 in the eg channel flow velocities increased as the slope length increased and the largest flow velocity was 0 38 m s 1 obtained at 7 m of slope length flow shear stress and stream power fluctuated along the eg channel which peaked at 5 m of slope length as 10 4 n m 2 and 3 4 n m 1 s 1 on lateral slopes the flow velocity did not linearly vary along the slope which could be attributed to the dominance of sheet flow before rill networks developed on the lateral side slopes after rill became connected on the slope surface runoff by rainfall and lateral inflow was able to merge and form tributaries to the main eg channel compared with the flow hydrodynamic characteristics in the eg channel flow shear stress and stream power on lateral slopes were extremely smaller at all slope positions representing great differences in erosive force and energy of runoff zhang et al 2014 the spatially averaged shear stress and stream power in the eg channel were 4 9 8 6 times higher than those on lateral slopes similarly upslope and lateral inflow contributions to total soil loss were about 70 and 10 respectively table 2 which was consistent with the result of flow hydrodynamic differences the results suggest that in a surface flow dominated eg system the difference between contributions of upslope and lateral inflows was induced by the differences in flow hydrodynamic characteristics in the eg channel and on lateral slopes 4 4 soil particle size distribution changes in eg channel and on lateral slopes the significance of the rills and eg tributaries of the lateral side slopes is seen in changes in the particle size distribution psd in the eg channel and on lateral slopes from before and after experiments xu et al 2006 showed how soil quality changes due to changes in particle size distribution in response to management they reasoned that this was due to erosion being a selective process with respect to psd in that some areas will be enriched in sand sizes and others in clay size particles depending upon their landscape position rhoton et al 1979 compared with the soil textures before the tests the clay 0 002 mm and fine silt 0 002 0 02 mm contents following the treatments imposed all decreased table 3 in contrasts the coarse silt 0 02 0 05 mm and fine sand 0 25 mm contents increased coarse sand contents were all less than 1 varying from 0 04 to 0 37 total contents of clay and fine silt 0 02 mm after the erosion experiment decreased from 42 5 to 31 8 36 0 across all erosion treatments and positions while total contents of coarse silt and fine sand 0 02 0 25 mm after the experiments increased from 57 4 to 64 0 68 1 across all erosion treatments and positions in the eg system raindrop splash and surface runoff detachment are highly associated with size selectivity of eroded sediment shi et al 2012 2013 wang et al 2014 during the rainfall and inflow stage fine particles were much easier to be transported while coarse particles were relatively harder to be transported the deposition or lack of suspension of sands induced a coarsening of soil left on the slope surface and in channels differences in psd between the eg main channel and the lateral slope soils were minor table 3 this can be attributed to the eg system providing a highly connected erosion system through which surface sediment was transported without being transport limited to illustrate the spatially distributed erosion impacts on the soil psd the percentages of the various size particles changed as a function of slope length in response to the different treatments as shown in fig 8 in treatment 1 15 and 50 mm h 1 coarse silt and fine sand particle contents were a little larger in the eg channel while clay and fine silt contents were correspondingly smaller in the eg channel compared with lateral slopes fig 8a and 8b on the lateral slopes coarse silt and fine sand contents showed fluctuations along the slope length and were larger than the contents in the original soil this could be attributed to the coarser particles being harder to detach and transport to the outlet conversely fine silt and clay contents at different slope positions were all under 20 illustrating that more fine silt and clay particles were transported to the outlet during the experiment compared with the fluctuation range of soil particle contents on the lateral slopes the fluctuation range in the eg channel was larger which was related to the serious erosion that included mass failures of sidewalls and random temporary deposition in treatment 2 20 and 50 mm h 1 soil particle contents also showed a fluctuation trend along the slope length on lateral slopes fine sand and coarse silt contents showed a complementary relationship as both contents were larger than those in original soil in contrasts clay and fine silt contents were smaller than those before experiments fig 8c in the eg channel the fluctuation range was wider than on lateral slopes fig 8d compared with fluctuation range of soil particle contents in 15 slope treatment the fluctuation in the 20 slope treatments showed a wider range slope gradient increment increased the detachment randomness of soil particles which might be a reason for higher fluctuation in treatment 3 20 and 100 mm h 1 treatment soil particle contents on the lateral slopes exhibited small fluctuations from 1 m to 6 m of slope length at the 7 m of slope length coarse silt content dramatically increased while fine sand content decreased fig 8e this could be related to raindrop splash dominated at this location because of less surface runoff at the downslope area compared with lateral slopes coarse particle content decreased while fine particles increased fig 8f this is the result of larger runoff energy flushing sediment readily through the eg channel compared with rills on lateral slopes foster 1986 wang and shi 2015 4 5 limitations of this experimental study this study quantified how upslope and lateral inflows influence soil loss in a typical ephemeral gully system on the loess plateau this study addresses the current research gap related to the upslope and lateral inflow impacts on flow hydrodynamics and soil degradation in an eg system especially lateral inflow contributions to the runoff connectivity of the eg system through the formation of lateral rills but the inflow applied in this study was clear water for both lateral and upslope directions in field conditions overland flow from both upslope drainage area and lateral slopes will be sediment laden flow due to its detachment and consequently transport downstream compared with clear water inflow upslope and lateral inflow with different sediment concentrations would cause less soil loss in the ephemeral gully system tested because of transport capacity and detachment capacity limitations ellison 1948 zheng et al 2000 liu et al 2019 future studies should concentrate on the impacts of upslope and lateral sediment laden flows on ephemeral gully erosion wu et al 2019 this study demonstrated the eg erosion processes influenced by overland flow however subsurface flow from both upslope and lateral directions could also produce instabilities leading to further bank erosion and headcut development wilson 2011 zegeye et al 2018 future laboratory experiments or field investigation on quantifying these processes are also needed the specific size of the drainage areas above the eg and on the lateral slopes are highly variable and will lead to different inflow rates and subsequently different contribution results while such results are situation dependent and spatially variable upslope and lateral inflows in this study were based upon typical morphologic features i e contributing areas of the loess plateau thus the results are situation dependent and spatially variable but the understanding gained of inflow contributions to the hydrologic connectivity and soil degradation of the eg system in this study is widely applicable soil degradation by coarsening the soil with eg system development can contribute to loss of productivity as observed in the black soil region of china liu et al 2013 and other areas like in italy ollobarren et al 2016 5 conclusions simulated rainfall and inflow experiments that concentrated on quantifying upslope and lateral inflows impact on eg erosion were conducted the following results were observed 1 upslope inflow was the dominant 70 80 contributor to total runoff and soil loss while contributions of lateral inflow to total runoff and soil loss were only around 10 and rainfall contributed the other 10 20 2 lateral inflow was not only important in the formation of lateral rills contributing to runoff connectivity but also contributed to the development of an imbricated landform pattern and the lateral gradient of the hillslope 3 the spatial averaged shear stress and stream power in the eg main channel were 4 9 8 6 times those on lateral slopes which explained the contribution differences of upslope and lateral inflows 4 surface concentrated flow and sheet flow in the eg system shifted the soil particle size distribution to be coarser as soil particles lager than 0 02 mm increased by 12 6 averagely as most eg systems are related to farmland and pastures the eg erosion is a vital influencing factor in farmland and pasture soil degradation processes which needs further research this work demonstrates the critical need of preventing both upslope and lateral drainage contributions to eg channels to protect valuable soil resources from degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

associate editor terrestrial water storage tws variations can be influenced by both climatic variability and human activities in this study we made an integrated use of grace data and meteorological data to characterize the tws variations in the yellow river basin yrb during 2003 2015 and investigated the relationships between terrestrial water storage change twsc and human activities and climatic variability respectively additionally a novel simple but effective index was also proposed to quantify the contributions of different factors from climatic variability and human activities to twsc in the yrb and its different subregions the results indicated that there existed a significant tws decrease at a rate of 4 6 1 4 mm yr approximately 3 7 1 1 gt yr across the entire yrb during the past decade the variables including precipitation pet and ndvi had a correlation coefficient r of 0 76 0 63 and 0 38 respectively with twsc at annual scale apart from these the correlations between reservoir operation and annual twsc also have been estimated for the first time which showed a better performance r 0 85 than that between twsc and water withdrawals r 0 40 the results mainly indicated that twsc was attributed to the climatic variability while the intense human activities especially reservoir operation also generated a significant effect on twsc in the yrb these conclusions can provide beneficial guidance for the management and assessments of local water resources keywords terrestrial water storage tws grace climatic variability human activities yellow river basin 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws comprises all the forms of water stored under and above the earth including soil moisture groundwater lakes rivers wetlands and reservoirs li et al 2012 long et al 2017 variations in tws can be recognized as a key hydrological indictor because it reflects the net effects between the inputs e g precipitation snow or glacier retreat runoff and the outputs e g human water withdrawals runoff and evapotranspiration over regions its status can influence the processes of infiltration and baseflow which are closely related to runoff and groundwater li et al 2012 xie et al 2019 therefore a comprehensive and accurate investigation into tws variations can provide beneficial advice for water resources management and assessments the yellow river basin hereafter yrb features high sediment loads and heavy soil erosion due to its low vegetation cover intense human activities and frequent rainstorms this has resulted the variations in tws of this region under the dual influence of climatic variability and increasing human activities the impact of climatic variability on terrestrial water storage change twsc is mainly induced by the variation of different meteorological variables e g precipitation or evapotranspiration while human activities can seriously influence tws through reservoir operation or water withdrawals for irrigation industry and domestic uses as the cradle of chinese civilization the yrb is one of the most densely populated regions all over the world and heavily dependent on water resources to maintain sustainable social and economic development hence variations in tws have significant influence on the social and ecological environments of this region some studies have previously analyzed the tws variations over regions and investigated the relationships between precipitation and tws variations under variability yi et al 2016 proposed a linear regression method to separate the anthropogenic and climate driven effects on twsc in asia deng and chen 2017 investigated the influences of recent variability and human activities on water storage variations in central asia using grace data combined with meteorological data and pointed out that human activities were now the dominant factor driving the decline of terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa in the aral sea region and the northern tarim river basin more relevant literature including detailed descriptions about how climatic variability and human activities influence tws have been summarized in table 1 these studies mainly focused on the tws variations in the regions with limited human activities nevertheless the tws variations in the yrb have been barely studied because of its complicated topography and extensive human activities e g irrigation reservoir operation etc here we make an integrated use of grace data and meteorological data to estimate the variations in tws under climatic variability and human activities the relationships between twsc and the considered factors including potential evapotranspiration precipitation ndvi and water withdrawals also have been investigated in addition reservoir operation as one kind of important human activities has been taken into consideration to analyze its effect on twsc for the first time since successfully launched in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission has been proved to be helpful in detecting the spatial and temporal variations of vertically integrated tws from land surface to the underground aquifers especially in some regions with extremely limited in situ observations or intense human activities advances in satellite observations can also provide unique insights to study tws variations in large scale regions without the limitations existed in hydrological models given the above advantages grace data has been extensively used in hydrological model calibrations bai et al 2018 schumacher et al

from this study are summarized in section 6 and section 7 respectively 2 study area the yellow river sometimes also termed as huang he in chinese is the second longest river in china and thesixth longestriver in the world with a length of 5464 km originating from bayan har mountains on the qinghai tibet plateau it flows through nine provinces in china and finally empties into the bohai sea ji et al 2018 the yrb 95 e 119 e 32 n 41 n is a typical semi arid river basin a long term mean annual pet p of 2 1 with an area of approximately 7 95 105 km2 in northern china this basin consists of three reaches upper middle and lower reaches most of reservoirs are located on the mainstream of the yellow river in its upper and middle reaches and play a critical role in flood control drought mitigation power generation and crop irrigation meanwhile most of the irrigation areas are distributed in the middle and lower reaches that are close to north china plain ncp shown in fig 1 it is also noteworthy that there exists significant groundwater depletion in ncp due to anthropogenic water depletion in recent years feng et al 2013 the climate of the yrb is mainly dominated by an arid and semiarid continental monsoon huang et al 2015a wu et al 2013 mean annual precipitation in this region varies from 400 mm to 570 mm and annual potential evaporation ranges from 900 mm to 1050 mm according to observations from lijin station the annual runoff of the yellow river ranges from 11 43 km3 yr to 28 25 km3 yr which has experienced a noticeable decrease since the 1980 s as a result of climatic variability and intensive human activities cai and rosegrant 2004 in general the topography of this basin decreases from west to east with higher precipitation distribution in the southeastern part as compared to the northwestern part at a mean level more detailed information about the location and topography of the yrb are shown in fig 1 there exists a long history of agricultural irrigation more than 1000 years in the yrb yang et al 2004 according to statistics collected by yellow river conservancy commission of ministry of water resources the yrb now supplies water for more than 1 2 108 people about 12 of china s population irrigates over 200 000 km2 of farmland about 15 of china s cropland creates nearly 8 trillion yuan per year about 14 of china s gdp and is often regarded as one of the most important basins in china lin et al 2019 wang et al 2012 in addition more than 220 large and middle sized reservoirs have been built in this basin according to the newest water resources bulletin of the yellow river published by yellow river conservancy commission of ministry of water resources of china http www yellowriver gov cn other hhgb the annual water storage variations in these reservoirs which are even higher than the long term average annual runoff in some years can alter the distribution and amount of tws across the entire basin more information about main reservoirs are provided in table s1 in the supporting information 3 data 3 1 grace derived twsa to detect the variations in tws over the yrb we estimate time series in twsa from three different grace mass concentration mascon solutions which can be applied to estimating the mass anomalies at specified mass concentration blocks save et al 2016 namely 1 grace mascon data from the center for space research csr at university of texas austin save et al 2016 and 2 grace mascon data from jet propulsion laboratory jpl at nasa and california institute of technology california landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 3 grace mascon data from goddard space flight center gsfc at nasa awange et al 2011 luthcke et al 2017 techniques such as glacial isostatic adjustment gia geocenter corrections degree 1 coefficients swenson et al 2008 and atmospheric mass changes removal have been implemented in the process of reducing noise resulted by satellite measurements these mascon data have been widely used in previous studies because of its high reliability and convenience scanlon et al 2016 tapley et al 2019 for further detailed descriptions about data post processing applied to grace mascon data the reader is referred to the website at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data it should be noted that all grace data used in this study are anomalies relative to 2004 2009 time mean baseline that is to say this baseline should keep consistent when comparing grace data to other anomaly data such as soil moisture storage or groundwater storage to ensure the highest level of accuracy three monthly gridded grace products with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 are jointly used to estimate the tws variations for the entire yrb there are a few months of data missing during the study period from 2003 to 2015 due to battery management these missing data are interpolated by averaging the values of adjacent months this method is deemed as appropriate because it can maintain the average seasonal cycle well at monthly scale long et al 2015 in addition original gridded grace data is resampled into 0 1 0 1 to avoid the error in the marginal part induced by its coarse spatial resolution when estimating the tws variations in individual subregions which will be further introduced in section 6 3 2 meteorological data and runoff meteorological variables from 75 national meteorological observatory stations all shown in fig 1 including daily observations of air maximum temperature t max air minimum temperature t min sunshine duration s relative humidity rh and wind speed u during the period from 2003 to 2015 are provided by the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn in this study monthly precipitation of the yrb and its individual subregions is obtained by a thiessen polygon method and aggregated from the daily precipitation observations from 75 meteorological stations the gauged meteorological variables including air minimum temperature air maximum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity for the period 2003 2015 are interpolated into 0 1 0 1 gridded data by using the inverse distance weighting idw method liu et al 2017 these gridded factors are then jointly used to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet across the entire study basin and individual subregions based on the penman monteith equation in order to accurately characterize the variation of climate in the yrb a climatic dryness index defined as the ratio of pet over p pet p at annual scale is also recommended for use the annual in situ runoff observations data 2003 2015 of lijin station which is the last hydrological station before the yellow river empties into the bohai sea are collected from the yellow river

bi et al 2016 evaluated the simulated soil moisture from different land surface models in global land data assimilation system gldas i e noah mosaic variable infiltration capacity and community land model against the in situ soil moisture measurements and found that soil moisture products simulated by noah land surface model show the lowest bias and uncertainty compared to the other three land surface models in gldas in this study the monthly mean data for soil moisture storage sms and surface water storage sws come from the global land data assimilation system version 2 1 gldas 2 1 noah land surface model which simulates four different depths of soil layers i e 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm this product with a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution is available from 2000 to the present in order to accompany with twsa the original values of sms and sws are processed into anomaly values by subtracting the baseline average during 2004 2009 more information about gldas 2 1 dataset can be found at http disc sci gsfc nasa gov services grads gds gldas the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset mod13a3 version

the growth status of surface vegetation with merit of its high resolution and long continuous time series swenson et al 2008 olsson et al 2016 zhang et al 2019b in this study the mean values of yearly ndvi are extracted to analyze the dynamic relationship between annual changes in vegetation and twsc over the yrb vegetation coverage data of the study basin is extracted from modis ndvi data having a 0 01 0 01 spatial resolution soil moisture data is acquired from gldas with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 with the goal of matching the temporal scale of grace mascon data these datasets are further processed and spatially averaged to acquire a monthly time series data during the period from 2003 to 2015 to evaluate the effect of human activities on twsc we also collect annual water withdrawals data and water storage variations in large and medium size reservoirs across the entire yrb during the period of 2003 2015 these data are obtained from the water resources bulletin of the yellow river which is published by yellow river conservancy commission of ministry of water resources of china http www yellowriver gov cn other hhgb please refer to table 2 for more specific data descriptions 4 methods this study is designed to investigate the influences of climatic variability and human activities on terrestrial water storage variations across the yrb the flowchart of this study is depicted in fig 2 in this section a general description about the flowchart is presented firstly information including human activities and climate across the study region are collected and processed secondly the twsa and twsc in different subregions are estimated by the grace mascon data based on a generalized three cornered hat method then the relationships between twsc and different factors from human activities and climatic variability are analyzed based on correlation analysis finally a new index is proposed with the goal of assessing the contributions of different factors to twsc across the yrb and its subregions in the following sections the main methods used in this study will be presented 4 1 terrestrial water storage and its uncertainty in this study we quantify the uncertainty of grace derived twsa via a generalized three cornered hat method gtch the classical three cornered hat tch method gray and allan 1974 is proposed to estimate uncertainties on the hypothesis that all variables are independent this method was further modified by tavella and premoli 1994 for proposing the gtch method which doesn t require that the variables must be entirely uncorrelated it has been proved that the gtch method is an effective way to estimate uncertainties without a priori knowledge of true values more detailed information about estimating the uncertainties in tws variations based on the gtch method can refer to the previous studies chen et al 2019 long et al 2014a xu et al 2018b the individual uncertainties of three grace solutions can be obtained based on the gtch method afterwards a combined series of twsa is created by considering the weight average of each product 1 t w s a combined i 1 3 w i t w s a i 2 w i 1 u i i 1 3 1 u i where twsa i is the time series of grace solutions including csr jpl and gsfc u i is the uncertainty of each grace solutions wi is the weight of twsa i which depends on the value of its uncertainty in other words wi is smaller in eq 2 when the uncertainty of corresponding twsa i is higher according to previous studies yi et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 yao et al 2019 twsa is made up of surface water storage anomalies swsa including the volume of water stored in reservoirs wetlands and lakes rivers snowpack and glaciers soil moisture storage anomalies smsa and groundwater storage anomalies gwsa which can be expressed as 3 t w s a s w s a g w s a s m s a where twsa can be obtained from grace by deducting their mean value during the base period 2004 2009 swsa and smsa can be acquired from gldas 2 1 noah land surface model gwsa will be obtained by isolating the swsa and smsa simulated by hydrologic models from the grace derived twsa that is 4 g w s a t w s a s w s a s m s a 4 2 penman monteith method penman monteith formula penman 1948 is proved to have a better performance to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet than other methods donohue et al 2010 li et al 2016 ma et al 2018 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2019 therefore penman monteith method recommended by food and agriculture organization fao is used to estimate pet in the yrb which can be expressed as 5 p e t 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u where pet is potential evapotranspiration mm day 1 δ is the slope of the saturated vapour pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 rn is net radiation at the canopy surface mj m 2day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2day 1 γ is a psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t is the mean monthly air temperature at a height of 2 m c u is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 es is the saturated vapour pressure at a height of 2 m ea is the actual vapour pressure at a height of 2 m all daily results are added to obtain monthly data 4 3 pearson correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient r has been selected to evaluate the relationship between tws variations and the other related variables e g p pet and pet p in statistics the pearson s correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations for time series of x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n and y y 1 y 2 y 3 y n the pearson correlation coefficient r is defined as follows 6 r c o v x y σ x σ y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 1 r 1 where n is the number of samples xi represents annual tws variations and yi represents the other related factors at annual scale x and y are mean values during the study period the values of 1 and 1 represent total negative and positive correlations respectively while a value of 0 denotes there is no correlation additionally the student s t test gao et al 2018 has been applied to evaluating the significance level of the correlation coefficient when the p value associated with r is less than the significance level commonly 0 01 or 0 05 the significance test is accepted 4 4 a novel index for assessing the contribution to tws variations as grace can detect tws variations influenced by both human activities and climatic variability huang et al 2015b the climate driven tws variations can be estimated as the following equation 7 t w s c c t w s c grace t w s c human a c t i v i t i e s t w s c grace t w s c r t w s c w where t w s c c is climate driven tws variations t w s c grace is the annual twsc estimated by grace data and t w s c humanactivities is the part of tws variations induced by human activities that mainly consists of reservoir operation t w s c r and water withdrawals t w s c w in this study as for the influence of other human activities we have not taken them into consideration due to the lack of related data and they are regarded as less important than reservoirs and water withdrawals for twsc in this study to further describe the fractional contribution rate of human activities and climatic variability to twsc a novel index is proposed hereafter to assess the contribution of different factors to tws variations which can be computed as follows 8 1 η r t w s c r t w s c r t w s c w t w s c c 100 8 2 η w t w s c w t w s c r t w s c w t w s c c 100 8 3 η c t w s c grace t w s c r t w s c w t w s c r t w s c w t w s c c 100 where ηr ηw and ηc are the contribution of reservoir operation water withdrawals and climatic variability to twsc respectively when η is a positive value it provides a positive influence on twsc on the contrary it provides a negative influence on twsc when η is a negative value for example the impoundment of water in reservoirs can have a positive effect on twsc while the water withdrawals for irrigation have a negative effect on twsc over regions 5 results 5 1 temporal and spatial terrestrial water storage variations in the yrb fig 3 shows the monthly time series of twsa and its main components including gwsa smsa and swsa during the period from 2003 to 2015 in the yrb to reduce the uncertainty a series of twsa is calculated by taking the ensemble mean value of different grace solutions smsa and swsa are obtained from gldas while gwsa is estimated as a residual in eq 4 as seen from fig 3 a noticeable increase in twsa is observed in 2003 which may be resulted by frequent activities in atmospheric cold fronts that induced an unprecedented low temperature over the entire yrb http www yellowriver gov cn other hhgb 2003 htm as a result the maximum positive annual twsa is larger than 40 mm and occurs in november 2003 additionally the annual twsa in the yrb reaches the minimum negative anomaly of 69 8 mm in october 2015 as depicted in fig 4 a annual twsa shows a general depletion from 2003 to 2015 y 4 64x 19 3 with a decreasing rate of 4 64 1 4 mm yr 95 confidence intervals hereinafter the amount of annual groundwater also has been substantially reduced at a rate of 4 2 1 0 mm yr while the sum of annual smsa and annual swsa doesn t show an obvious decreasing trend the previous study of zhang et al 2019a indicated that groundwater in the yrb has experienced a general depletion during the period from 2005 to 2013 which was consistent with the results derived in this study as depicted in fig 4 d twsa is highly consistent with gwsa based on a linear regression model showing a coefficient of determination over 0 76 p 0 01 and a scale coefficient of 0 99 in summary both gwsa and twsa present a sharp decreasing trend almost at the same rate while smsa swsa shows a slight decreasing trend it denotes that the gw depletion may play an important role in the twsa decrease in the yrb during the study period fig 5 shows the multi year average of monthly twsa in the yrb from 2003 to 2015 the results indicate that monthly twsa has distinct seasonal variations with maximum and minimum values in may and september respectively overall twsa is larger during the autumn months september to november than the spring months march to may we apply a linear regression model at each pixel to the mean annual values of the grace derived twsa fig 6 illustrates the interannual trends of twsa which show an obvious spatial difference ranging from 23 16 mm yr to 4 44 mm yr in the yrb during the study period the twsa shows a small positive trend in the upper reaches while a sharp negative trend is observed in the middle and lower reaches with a maximum trend of more than 20 mm yr it is noted that the middle reaches and lower reaches of the yellow river enclose the north china plain shown in fig 1 where enormous water depletion driven by groundwater overexploitation has been found in recent years feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015c seasonal spatial analysis results illustrate that twsa in the yrb experiences a similar change trend throughout all the seasons djf fig s1a mam fig s1b jja fig s1c and son fig s1d to contrast regional tws variations further we group the entire yrb into eight subregions based on climate continent similarities and the secondary basin boundary in china shown in fig 1 the corresponding twsa and detailed information about climate have been shown in fig 7 and table 3 simultaneously as shown in fig 7 annual twsa in most subregions shows a significant decrease during 2003 2015 except region i and region ii that are located in the upper reach of the yellow river in addition the annual twsa in most subregions reaches their maximums in 2004 after experiencing high precipitation in 2003 when the annual precipitation in the yrb is 28 6 higher than the mean annual precipitation during 1980 2000 the rates of changes in twsa range from 19 0 mm yr to 2 3 mm yr showing an obvious discrepancy in different subregions 5 2 correlation analysis between twsc and climatic variability and vegetation changes p and pet representing available water and energy over regions respectively are the two most important meteorological variables that can capture climatic variability wei et al 2015 yang et al 2012 the climatic dryness index represented as pet p which can reflect the climatic conditions over regions is higher when the study region is drier therefore we analyze the temporal dynamics of twsc and its response to different climatic factors including precipitation pet and dryness index pet p in this section the correlation coefficients r between twsc and precipitation pet and pet p are calculated respectively the spatial distribution of precipitation has been depicted in fig 8 a which shows an increase from the northwestern part to the southeastern part ranging from 0 900 mm yr moreover there is a significant spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of mean annual pet fig 8 b which shows low values in the upper reaches while high values have been observed in the middle and lower reaches similar spatial distributions have been found for dryness index pet p and ndvi which are depicted in fig 8 c and d respectively the regions with low pet p tend to have high ndvi values because ndvi variations are driven by climatic variables chu et al 2019 precipitation is considered to be one of the most important climatic factors affecting tws variations fig 9 b shows that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between twsc and precipitation in the yrb r 0 76 p 0 01 in contrast a statistically significant negative correlation is observed between twsc and pet r 0 63 p 0 01 shown in fig 9 d the highest correlation coefficient is observed between twsc and pet p which can reflect the coupled effect of p and pet with r 0 78 and p 0 01 shown in fig 9 f apart from p and pet variations in the surface vegetation coverage which is usually represented as ndvi may indirectly influence the soil moisture water storage over regions through canopy interception and evapotranspiration for example vegetation plays a notably important role in the infiltration of precipitation and the process of evapotranspiration chu et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 szilagyi et al 1998 therefore the relationship between twsc and vegetation dynamics is also considered in this study over the past decade a large scale conservation program has been conducted by converting farmland into forest and grassland in the yrb under the grain for green project gfgp wei et al 2015 in fig 9 g a total increase of 0 04 occurs in ndvi with an average rising rate of more than 0 003 yr as seen from fig 9 h there is a relatively poor negative correlation between twsc and ndvi r 0 38 p 0 1 this result indicates that the annual twsc is the least sensitive to ndvi changes as compared to precipitation and pet in the yrb the relationships between twsc and different factors from climatic variability and ndvi in eight subregions are depicted respectively in table 4 at the same time twsc shows a good correlation with p pet and pet p in most subregions except the lower reaches region viii where only one weather station is located fig 1 note that ndvi is affected by both climatic variability and human activities which is found to have an insignificant role in twsc except the middle and lower part of the large basin where the policy of grain for green project was launched in 1999 5 3 effect of human activities on twsc the influence of human activities on twsc are represented by two different patterns the negative contribution of water loss due to water withdrawals and the positive contribution of water gains impounded by reservoirs therefore we investigate the relationships between twsc and reservoir water storage change rc and water withdrawals ww in the yrb at yearly scale based on the data provided by water resources bulletin of the yellow river as for the influence of other human activities such as terraces or check dams we have not taken them into consideration in this study owing to the absence of related data 5 3 1 water withdrawals with the rapid development of society and economy there is a rising demand for water resources in the yrb for example the total water withdrawals of this study region has increased up to 412 km3 yr from 336 km3 yr an increase of approximately 25 during the study period shown in fig 10 from 2003 to 2015 a rapid water withdrawals rise for agriculture and industry can also be identified within the yrb the magnitudes of which is ranging from 236 3 km3 yr to 292 9 km3 yr and 40 8 km3 yr to 57 4 km3 yr respectively notably the water withdrawals for irrigation account for the majority of the total water withdrawals because the yrb represents an important agricultural area for wheat and corn in china therefore large quantities of groundwater are needed for irrigation according to previous studies zhang et al 2019a huang et al 2015c long term overexploitation of groundwater has been accelerating the rate of depleting tws in the yrb and its neighbor regions such as ncp even resulting a funnel shaped depression in the groundwater table fig 11 a and b show that twsc may decrease more severely when water withdrawals are higher r 0 40 p 0 1 5 3 2 reservoir operation some studies have investigated the twsc induced by the operation of large reservoirs such as the three gorges reservoir located in the yangtze river or the longyangxia reservoir located in the upper stream of yellow river yi et al 2017 wang et al 2011 xie et al 2018 their results show that the operation of reservoir can exert a profound influence in the local water storage and therefore are regarded as important indicators of anthropogenic impacts on environments there are different kinds of reservoir operation in the yrb for irrigation water supply as well as power generation especially since the implementation of water sediment regulation schemes wsrs for sediment reduction and flood control started in year 2002 kong et al 2015 therefore it is not enough to only consider the effect of water withdrawals when analyzing the causes of tws variations we speculate that the large scale reservoir operation may play an important role in twsc especially in the local regions where large reservoirs are located the variable that describes reservoir operation can be represented as reservoir water storage change rc in this study seen from fig 11 c and d variations in reservoir water storage have a wide range from 81 7 km3 yr to 134 6 km3 yr here positive values denote water impoundment while negative values denote water discharge in reservoirs and can greatly influence twsc in the yrb for example the water storage in reservoirs accounted for 70 and 52 of the total runoff in 2003 and 2005 respectively shown in fig s2 meanwhile fig 11 d further shows the relationship between annual twsc and reservoir water storage change in the yrb the results indicate that reservoir water storage change is highly correlated with the twsc r 0 85 p 0 01 the integrated effect of water withdrawals and reservoir operation on twsc is also shown in fig 11 e and f overall the human activities including water withdrawals and reservoir operation here have a negative effect on tws variations r 0 79 p 0 01 the relationships between different factors from human activities and twsc in eight subregions are also depicted in table 5 water withdrawals show a good correlation with twsc at yearly scale in most of the regions except region i and region ii where limited human activities are found rc has a good correlation in most of the subregions from the yrb however it presents a relative poor correlation with twsc in region iii and v because only few reservoirs are located in these regions shown in s2 in addition twsc responds well to the integrated effect of ww and rc in all subregions 5 4 contributions of different factors to twsc the contributions of different factors from climatic variability and human activities including water withdrawals and reservoir operation to twsc have been analyzed based on the proposed index presented in section 4 4 in general the bigger η value of a single factor the more contribution it makes to the total tws variations the computed contributions are depicted in table 6 according to the results shown in table 6 climatic variability is an important factor influencing twsc among all factors in most subregions in addition the water withdrawals have a significant effect on twsc especially in the middle and lower reaches where large quantities of water are needed for irrigation or industry with the increasing water demand in the yrb it may make a greater contribution to twsc in these regions under the implementation of water sediment regulation scheme annual water storage in reservoirs vary frequently with the water discharge or impoundment induced by reservoir operation these changes can play an important role in the local tws variations especially in regions where large reservoirs are located for example longyangxia reservoir the largest reservoir within the yellow river yi et al 2017 is located in region i and exerts a profound effect on the twsc for this region as for the entire yrb the reservoir water storage change accounts for a relatively small part compared to the other factors mentioned above 6 discussion 6 1 donimating fators for twsc in the study region as depicted in table 6 and fig 12 i climatic variability and water withdrawals are the dominating factors that affect the twsc across the entire yrb although reservoir operation plays a relative small role compared to climatic variability it still can t be neglected when analyzing the contributions of different factors to twsc for the yrb especially in some subregions such as region i and region vii according to the results depicted in table 3 6 and figs 9 12 the values of the index η may vary from region to region under the joint effects of human activities and climatic variability in general climatic variability can exert a significant effect on twsc in all subregions especially in regions where infrequent human activities exist while the contributions of human activities including reservoir operation and water withdrawals to twsc in different subregions have obvious spatial heterogeneity for example longyangxia reservoir located in region i and xiaolangdi reservoir located in region vii are two major reservoirs located in the yrb which account for the majority of annual water storage changes induced by water sediment regulation schemes jin et al 2019 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 as shown in fig 12 a fig 12 g and fig s3 b reservoir operation plays a vital role in twsc for region i and region vii with higher values of η r than the other regions water withdrawals is another important factor that can significantly affect twsc in the majority of subregions except region i which is a sparsely populated basin because of the harsh environmental and climatic conditions as seen from fig 12 and fig s3 a it should be noted that the contributions of water withdrawals to twsc are larger in middle and lower reaches than that in the upper reach of the yellow river 6 2 contributions of precipitation and pet to twscc the twsc induced by climatic variability twsc c mainly consists of precipitation induced twsc twsc p and pet induced twsc twsc pet therefore twsc pet can be estimated by the difference between twsc c and twsc p seen from fig 13 both precipitation and pet can exert a significant effect on twsc c over the study regions with high values of η w or η r however the contribution of precipitation is slightly higher than that of pet to twsc induced by climatic variability across the entire yrb given that only few glaciers are located in the study regions most upper reach of the basin precipitation is almost the sole source of water storage increase for the yrb however the factors that lead to a decrease in water storage may include pet and water withdrawals for various human activities such as agricultural irrigation and industrial production li et al 2017a 2017b although this index can provide good insights into the relationships between climatic variability and twsc more attentions should still be given to the mechanism about how climatic variability influences tws variations 6 3 uncertainties and limitations in this study grace data have been proven to be a useful tool to determine the mass change in tws through the relatively large regions over 200 000 km2 however cautions should still be taken when applying the grace data to detecting the tws variations in some small scale subregions such as region viii due to its coarse spatial resolution in previous studies grace data have been successfully downscaled or resampled to a finer resolution for better applications in the medium and small scale catchments seyoum and milewski 2017 abiy and melesse 2017 for example abiy and melesse 2017 applied the grace data csr rl05 to estimating the net tws variations in the tana basin ethiopia with a catchment area of 15 000 km2 by a resampling method in this study we mainly care about the trend of tws variation and the original grace data is simply resampled into 0 1 to reduce the uncertainty and error induced by its sparse spatial resolution according to abiy and melesse 2017 when computing the new contribution index human activities only include the most important ones i e water withdrawals and reservoir operation other human activities including artificial check dams and terraces are not taken into account due to the absence of related data although previous studies indicate that the effectiveness of check dams have gradually decreased since the 2000 s as they are progressively filled with eroded materials wang et al 2015 it can still inevitably play a role in twsc in particular in the middle reach of the basin in spite of the mentioned uncertainties and limitations the results presented in our study provide a regional scale evaluation of tws variation in the yrb and quantify the main contributions to twsc in its subregions for more accurate estimation of tws variations a thorough consideration of all human activities is proposed in our next study to fully understand the complex underlying mechanism for tws variations 7 conclusions in the past decade tremendous changes have taken place in the yrb about tws due to the joint effects of climatic variability and human activities however the dearth of information about in situ observations extremely limited our understanding of the dynamic variations in tws this study aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal distributions of tws across the yrb during 2003 2015 using the grace data meanwhile the twsc and its link to climatic variability ndvi as well as human activities were also investigated the contributions to twsc from climatic variability and human activities were presented based on a new index the major conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 grace based estimates indicate that twsa in the yrb has undergone a sharp decrease at a rate of 4 64 1 4 mm yr during the past decade this is consistent with the depletion of groundwater which shows a similar rate of 4 2 1 0 mm yr as compared to tws variations in addition there exists a strong spatial heterogeneity in tws variations across the entire yrb grace derived water storages are found to decrease significantly in the middle and lower reaches where there are heavily irrigated areas whereas a slight increasing trend is observed in the upper reaches 2 for climatic variables there is a good consistency between twsc and variations in precipitation and pet with correlation coefficients of 0 76 and 0 63 respectively in the yrb in addition there is also a high correlation coefficient of 0 78 with the climatic dryness index pet p although the relationship between ndvi and twsc is not significant r 0 38 across the entire study region ndvi plays an important role in the middle and lower reaches with r ranging from 0 42 to 0 74 3 for human activities twsc in the yrb shows a better relationship with reservoir water storage change r 0 85 than water withdrawals r 0 4 with the increasing demand in water supply human activities may account for an increasing proportion of twsc it is also noteworthy that the effect of reservoir water storage change on twsc should not be neglected especially in the regions where large reservoirs are located such as region i and vii 4 a simple but effective index is proposed to assess the contributions of different factors to twsc in this study the results show that the primary causes of the twsc vary from region to region which depends on the characteristics of climate and the degree of human activities including water withdrawals and reservoir operation in different regions with rapid development of human society water shortage is becoming more prominent especially in the dense populated regions such as the yrb this study can serve as a good basis for understanding twsc in the yrb and provide valuable guidance for decisions makers in making right polices for water resources assessments more studies are also needed to further estimate the tws variations when detailed human activities data are available author

associate editor terrestrial water storage tws variations can be influenced by both climatic variability and human activities in this study we made an integrated use of grace data and meteorological data to characterize the tws variations in the yellow river basin yrb during 2003 2015 and investigated the relationships between terrestrial water storage change twsc and human activities and climatic variability respectively additionally a novel simple but effective index was also proposed to quantify the contributions of different factors from climatic variability and human activities to twsc in the yrb and its different subregions the results indicated that there existed a significant tws decrease at a rate of 4 6 1 4 mm yr approximately 3 7 1 1 gt yr across the entire yrb during the past decade the variables including precipitation pet and ndvi had a correlation coefficient r of 0 76 0 63 and 0 38 respectively with twsc at annual scale apart from these the correlations between reservoir operation and annual twsc also have been estimated for the first time which showed a better performance r 0 85 than that between twsc and water withdrawals r 0 40 the results mainly indicated that twsc was attributed to the climatic variability while the intense human activities especially reservoir operation also generated a significant effect on twsc in the yrb these conclusions can provide beneficial guidance for the management and assessments of local water resources keywords terrestrial water storage tws grace climatic variability human activities yellow river basin 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws comprises all the forms of water stored under and above the earth including soil moisture groundwater lakes rivers wetlands and reservoirs li et al 2012 long et al 2017 variations in tws can be recognized as a key hydrological indictor because it reflects the net effects between the inputs e g precipitation snow or glacier retreat runoff and the outputs e g human water withdrawals runoff and evapotranspiration over regions its status can influence the processes of infiltration and baseflow which are closely related to runoff and groundwater li et al 2012 xie et al 2019 therefore a comprehensive and accurate investigation into tws variations can provide beneficial advice for water resources management and assessments the yellow river basin hereafter yrb features high sediment loads and heavy soil erosion due to its low vegetation cover intense human activities and frequent rainstorms this has resulted the variations in tws of this region under the dual influence of climatic variability and increasing human activities the impact of climatic variability on terrestrial water storage change twsc is mainly induced by the variation of different meteorological variables e g precipitation or evapotranspiration while human activities can seriously influence tws through reservoir operation or water withdrawals for irrigation industry and domestic uses as the cradle of chinese civilization the yrb is one of the most densely populated regions all over the world and heavily dependent on water resources to maintain sustainable social and economic development hence variations in tws have significant influence on the social and ecological environments of this region some studies have previously analyzed the tws variations over regions and investigated the relationships between precipitation and tws variations under variability yi et al 2016 proposed a linear regression method to separate the anthropogenic and climate driven effects on twsc in asia deng and chen 2017 investigated the influences of recent variability and human activities on water storage variations in central asia using grace data combined with meteorological data and pointed out that human activities were now the dominant factor driving the decline of terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa in the aral sea region and the northern tarim river basin more relevant literature including detailed descriptions about how climatic variability and human activities influence tws have been summarized in table 1 these studies mainly focused on the tws variations in the regions with limited human activities nevertheless the tws variations in the yrb have been barely studied because of its complicated topography and extensive human activities e g irrigation reservoir operation etc here we make an integrated use of grace data and meteorological data to estimate the variations in tws under climatic variability and human activities the relationships between twsc and the considered factors including potential evapotranspiration precipitation ndvi and water withdrawals also have been investigated in addition reservoir operation as one kind of important human activities has been taken into consideration to analyze its effect on twsc for the first time since successfully launched in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission has been proved to be helpful in detecting the spatial and temporal variations of vertically integrated tws from land surface to the underground aquifers especially in some regions with extremely limited in situ observations or intense human activities advances in satellite observations can also provide unique insights to study tws variations in large scale regions without the limitations existed in hydrological models given the above advantages grace data has been extensively used in hydrological model calibrations bai et al 2018 schumacher et al

al 2019 and monitoring of glacier retreat wang et al 2017 the primary objectives of this work are therefore 1 to investigate the characteristics of tws variations across the yrb in recent decade 2 to analyze the relationships between twsc and climatic variability and human activities respectively 3 to quantify the contributions of climatic variability and human activities to tws variations the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we have a brief description for the study area section 3 and section 4 introduce respectively the dataset and methods applied to analyzing the characteristics of twsc section 5 includes all the results and discussions regarding changes in tws and the relationship between twsc and climatic variability and human activities meanwhile the trends for twsa and contributions of different factors are also evaluated based on grace data combined with multi sets of meteorological forcing data in this section finally the discussion and conclusions from this study are summarized in section 6 and section 7 respectively 2 study area the yellow river sometimes also termed as huang he in chinese is the second longest river in china and thesixth longestriver in the world with a length of 5464 km originating from bayan har mountains on the qinghai tibet plateau it flows through nine provinces in china and finally empties into the bohai sea ji et al 2018 the yrb 95 e 119 e 32 n 41 n is a typical semi arid river basin a long term mean annual pet p of 2 1 with an area of approximately 7 95 105 km2 in northern china this basin consists of three reaches upper middle and lower reaches most of reservoirs are located on the mainstream of the yellow river in its upper and middle reaches and play a critical role in flood control drought mitigation power generation and crop irrigation meanwhile most of the irrigation areas are distributed in the middle and lower reaches that are close to north china plain ncp shown in fig 1 it is also noteworthy that there exists significant groundwater depletion in ncp due to anthropogenic water depletion in recent years feng et al 2013 the climate of the yrb is mainly dominated by an arid and semiarid continental monsoon huang et al 2015a wu et al 2013 mean annual precipitation in this region varies from 400 mm to 570 mm and annual potential evaporation ranges from 900 mm to 1050 mm according to observations from lijin station the annual runoff of the yellow river ranges from 11 43 km3 yr to 28 25 km3 yr which has experienced a noticeable decrease since the 1980 s as a result of climatic variability and intensive human activities cai and rosegrant 2004 in general the topography of this basin decreases from west to east with higher precipitation distribution in the southeastern part as compared to the northwestern part at a mean level more detailed information about the location and topography of the yrb are shown in fig 1 there exists a long history of agricultural irrigation more than 1000 years in the yrb yang et al 2004 according to statistics collected by yellow river conservancy commission of ministry of water resources the yrb now supplies water for more than 1 2 108 people about 12 of china s population irrigates over 200 000 km2 of farmland about 15 of china s cropland creates nearly 8 trillion yuan per year about 14 of china s gdp and is often regarded as one of the most important basins in china lin et al 2019 wang et al 2012 in addition more than 220 large and middle sized reservoirs have been built in this basin according to the newest water resources bulletin of the yellow river published by yellow river conservancy commission of ministry of water resources of china http www yellowriver gov cn other hhgb the annual water storage variations in these reservoirs which are even higher than the long term average annual runoff in some years can alter the distribution and amount of tws across the entire basin more information about main reservoirs are provided in table s1 in the supporting information 3 data 3 1 grace derived twsa to detect the variations in tws over the yrb we estimate time series in twsa from three different grace mass concentration mascon solutions which can be applied to estimating the mass anomalies at specified mass concentration blocks save et al 2016 namely 1 grace mascon data from the center for space research csr at university of texas austin save et al 2016 and 2 grace mascon data from jet propulsion laboratory jpl at nasa and california institute of technology california landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 3 grace mascon data from goddard space flight center gsfc at nasa awange et al 2011 luthcke et al 2017 techniques such as glacial isostatic adjustment gia geocenter corrections degree 1 coefficients swenson et al 2008 and atmospheric mass changes removal have been implemented in the process of reducing noise resulted by satellite measurements these mascon data have been widely used in previous studies because of its high reliability and convenience scanlon et al 2016 tapley et al 2019 for further detailed descriptions about data post processing applied to grace mascon data the reader is referred to the website at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data it should be noted that all grace data used in this study are anomalies relative to 2004 2009 time mean baseline that is to say this baseline should keep consistent when comparing grace data to other anomaly data such as soil moisture storage or groundwater storage to ensure the highest level of accuracy three monthly gridded grace products with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 are jointly used to estimate the tws variations for the entire yrb there are a few months of data missing during the study period from 2003 to 2015 due to battery management these missing data are interpolated by averaging the values of adjacent months this method is deemed as appropriate because it can maintain the average seasonal cycle well at monthly scale long et al 2015 in addition original gridded grace data is resampled into 0 1 0 1 to avoid the error in the marginal part induced by its coarse spatial resolution when estimating the tws variations in individual subregions which will be further introduced in section 6 3 2 meteorological data and runoff meteorological variables from 75

subregions is obtained by a thiessen polygon method and aggregated from the daily precipitation observations from 75 meteorological stations the gauged meteorological variables including air minimum temperature air maximum temperature wind speed sunshine duration and relative humidity for the period 2003 2015 are interpolated into 0 1 0 1 gridded data by using the inverse distance weighting idw method liu et al 2017 these gridded factors are then jointly used to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet across the entire study basin and individual subregions based on the penman monteith equation in order to accurately characterize the variation of climate in the yrb a climatic dryness index defined as the ratio of pet over p pet p at annual scale is also recommended for use the

further processed and spatially averaged to acquire a monthly time series data during the period from 2003 to 2015 to evaluate the effect of human activities on twsc we also collect annual water withdrawals data and water storage variations in large and medium size reservoirs across the entire yrb during the period of 2003 2015 these data are obtained from the water resources bulletin of the yellow river which is published by yellow river conservancy commission of ministry of water resources of china http www yellowriver gov cn other hhgb please refer to table 2 for more specific data descriptions 4 methods this study is designed to investigate the influences of climatic variability and human activities on terrestrial water storage variations across the yrb the flowchart of this study is depicted in fig 2 in this section a general description about the flowchart is presented firstly information including human activities and climate across the study region are collected and processed secondly the twsa and twsc in different subregions are estimated by the grace mascon data based on a generalized three cornered hat method then the relationships between twsc and different factors from human activities and climatic variability are analyzed based on correlation analysis finally a new index is proposed with the goal of assessing the contributions of different factors to twsc across the yrb and its subregions in the following sections the main methods used in this study will be presented 4 1 terrestrial water storage and its uncertainty in this study we quantify the uncertainty of grace derived twsa via a generalized three cornered hat method gtch the classical three cornered hat tch method gray and allan 1974 is proposed to estimate uncertainties on the hypothesis that all variables are independent this method was further modified by tavella and premoli 1994 for proposing the gtch method which doesn t require that the variables must be entirely uncorrelated it has been proved that the gtch method is an effective way to estimate uncertainties without a priori knowledge of true values more detailed information about estimating the uncertainties in tws variations based on the gtch method can refer to the previous studies chen et al 2019 long et al 2014a xu et al 2018b the individual uncertainties of three grace solutions can be obtained based on the gtch method afterwards a combined series of twsa is created by considering the weight average of each product 1 t w s a combined i 1 3 w i t w s a i 2 w i 1 u i i 1 3 1 u i where twsa i is the time series of grace solutions including csr jpl and gsfc u i is the uncertainty of each grace solutions wi is the weight of twsa i which depends on the value of its uncertainty in other words wi is smaller in eq 2 when the uncertainty of corresponding twsa i is higher according to previous studies yi et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 yao et al 2019 twsa is made up of surface water storage anomalies swsa including the volume of water stored in reservoirs wetlands and lakes rivers snowpack and glaciers soil moisture storage anomalies smsa and groundwater storage anomalies gwsa which can be expressed as 3 t w s a s w s a g w s a s m s a where twsa can be obtained from grace by deducting their mean value during the base period 2004 2009 swsa and smsa can be acquired from gldas 2 1 noah land surface model gwsa will be obtained by isolating the swsa and smsa simulated by hydrologic models from the grace derived twsa that is 4 g w s a t w s a s w s a s m s a 4 2 penman monteith method penman monteith formula penman 1948 is proved to have a better performance to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet than other methods donohue et al 2010 li et al 2016 ma et al 2018 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2019 therefore penman monteith method recommended by food and agriculture organization fao is used to estimate pet in the yrb which can be expressed as 5 p e t 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u where pet is potential evapotranspiration mm day 1 δ is the slope of the saturated vapour pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 rn is net radiation at the canopy surface mj m 2day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2day 1 γ is a psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t is the mean monthly air temperature at a height of 2 m c u is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 es is the saturated vapour pressure at a height of 2 m ea is the actual vapour pressure at a height of 2 m all daily results are added to obtain monthly data 4 3 pearson correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient r has been selected to evaluate the relationship between tws variations and the other related variables e g p pet and pet p in statistics the pearson s correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations for time series of x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n and y y 1 y 2 y 3 y n the pearson correlation coefficient r is defined as follows 6 r c o v x y σ x σ y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 1 r 1 where n is the number of samples xi represents annual tws variations and yi represents the other related factors at annual scale x and y are mean values during the study period the values of 1 and 1 represent total negative and positive correlations respectively while a value of 0 denotes there is no correlation additionally the student s t test gao et al 2018 has been applied to evaluating the significance level of the correlation coefficient when the p value associated with r is less than the significance level commonly 0 01 or 0 05 the significance test is accepted 4 4 a novel index for assessing the contribution to tws variations as grace can detect tws variations influenced by both human activities and climatic variability huang et al 2015b the climate driven tws variations can be estimated as the following equation 7 t w s c c t w s c grace t w s c human a c t i v i t i e s t w s c grace t w s c r t w s c w where t w s c c is climate driven tws variations t w s c grace is the annual twsc estimated by grace data and t w s c humanactivities is the part of tws variations induced by human activities that mainly consists of reservoir operation t w s c r and water withdrawals t w s c w in this study as for the influence of other human activities we have not taken them into consideration due to the lack of related data and they are regarded as less important than reservoirs and water withdrawals for twsc in this study to further describe the fractional contribution rate of human activities and climatic variability to twsc a novel index is proposed hereafter to assess the contribution of different factors to tws variations which can be computed as follows 8 1 η r t w s c r t w s c r t w s c w t w s c c 100 8 2 η w t w s c w t w s c r t w s c w t w s c c 100 8 3 η c t w s c grace t w s c r t w s c w t w s c r t w s c w t w s c c 100 where ηr ηw and ηc are the contribution of reservoir operation water withdrawals and climatic variability to twsc respectively when η is a positive value it provides a positive influence on twsc on the contrary it provides a negative influence on twsc when η is a negative value for example the impoundment of water in reservoirs can have a positive effect on twsc while the water withdrawals for irrigation have a negative effect on twsc over regions 5 results 5 1 temporal and spatial terrestrial water storage variations in the yrb fig 3 shows the monthly time series of twsa and its main components including gwsa smsa and swsa during the period from 2003 to 2015 in the yrb to reduce the uncertainty a series of twsa is calculated by taking the ensemble mean value of different grace solutions smsa and swsa are obtained from gldas while gwsa is estimated as a residual in eq 4 as seen from fig 3 a noticeable increase in twsa is observed in 2003 which may be resulted by frequent activities in atmospheric cold fronts that induced an unprecedented low temperature over the entire yrb http www yellowriver gov cn other hhgb 2003 htm as a result the maximum positive annual twsa is larger than 40 mm and occurs in november 2003 additionally the annual twsa in the yrb reaches the minimum negative anomaly of 69 8 mm in october 2015 as depicted in fig 4 a annual twsa shows a general depletion from 2003 to 2015 y 4 64x 19 3 with a decreasing rate of 4 64 1 4 mm yr 95 confidence intervals hereinafter the amount of annual groundwater also has been substantially reduced at a rate of 4 2 1 0 mm yr while the sum of annual smsa and annual swsa doesn t show an obvious decreasing trend the previous study of zhang et al 2019a indicated that groundwater in the yrb has experienced a general depletion during the period from 2005 to 2013 which was consistent with the results derived in this study as depicted in fig 4 d twsa is highly consistent with gwsa based on a linear regression model showing a coefficient of determination over 0 76 p 0 01 and a scale coefficient of 0 99 in summary both gwsa and twsa present a sharp decreasing trend almost at the same rate while smsa swsa shows a slight decreasing trend it denotes that the gw depletion may play an important role in the twsa decrease in the yrb during the study period fig 5 shows the multi year average of monthly twsa in the yrb from 2003 to 2015 the results indicate that monthly twsa has distinct seasonal variations with maximum and minimum values in may and september respectively overall twsa is larger during the autumn months september to november than the spring months march to may we apply a linear regression model at each pixel to the mean annual values of the grace derived twsa fig 6 illustrates the interannual trends of twsa which show an obvious spatial difference ranging from 23 16 mm yr to 4 44 mm yr in the yrb during the study period the twsa shows a small positive trend in the upper reaches while a sharp negative trend is observed in the middle and lower reaches with a maximum trend of more than 20 mm yr it is noted that the middle reaches and lower reaches of the yellow river enclose the north china plain shown in fig 1 where enormous water depletion driven by groundwater overexploitation has been found in recent years feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015c seasonal spatial analysis results illustrate that twsa in the yrb experiences a similar change trend throughout all the seasons djf fig s1a mam fig s1b jja fig s1c and son fig s1d to contrast regional tws variations further we group the entire yrb into eight subregions based on climate continent similarities and the secondary basin boundary in china shown in fig 1 the corresponding twsa and detailed information about climate have been shown in fig 7 and table 3 simultaneously as shown in fig 7 annual twsa in most subregions shows a significant decrease during 2003 2015 except region i and region ii that are located in the upper reach of the yellow river in addition the annual twsa in most subregions reaches their maximums in 2004 after experiencing high precipitation in 2003 when the annual precipitation in the yrb is 28 6 higher than the mean annual precipitation during 1980 2000 the rates of changes in twsa range from 19 0 mm yr to 2 3 mm yr showing an obvious discrepancy in different subregions 5 2 correlation analysis between twsc and climatic variability and vegetation changes p and pet representing available water and energy over regions respectively are the two most important meteorological variables that can capture climatic variability wei et al 2015 yang et al 2012 the climatic dryness index represented as pet p which can reflect the climatic conditions over regions is higher when the study region is drier therefore we analyze the temporal dynamics of twsc and its response to different climatic factors including precipitation pet and dryness index pet p in this section the correlation coefficients r between twsc and precipitation pet and pet p are calculated respectively the spatial distribution of precipitation has been depicted in fig 8 a which shows an increase from the northwestern part to the southeastern part ranging from 0 900 mm yr moreover there is a significant spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of mean annual pet fig 8 b which shows low values in the upper reaches while high values have been observed in the middle and lower reaches similar spatial distributions have been found for dryness index pet p and ndvi which are depicted in fig 8 c and d respectively the regions with low pet p tend to have high ndvi values because ndvi variations are driven by climatic variables chu et al 2019 precipitation is considered to be one of the most important climatic factors affecting tws variations fig 9 b shows that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between twsc and precipitation in the yrb r 0 76 p 0 01 in contrast a statistically significant negative correlation is observed between twsc and pet r 0 63 p 0 01 shown in fig 9 d the highest correlation coefficient is observed between twsc and pet p which can reflect the coupled effect of p and pet with r 0 78 and p 0 01 shown in fig 9 f apart from p and pet variations in the surface vegetation coverage which is usually represented as ndvi may indirectly influence the soil moisture water storage over regions through canopy interception and evapotranspiration for example vegetation plays a notably important role in the infiltration of precipitation and the process of evapotranspiration chu et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 szilagyi et al 1998 therefore the relationship between twsc and vegetation dynamics is also considered in this study over the past decade a large scale conservation program has been conducted by converting farmland into forest and grassland in the yrb under the grain for green project gfgp wei et al 2015 in fig 9 g a total increase of 0 04 occurs in ndvi with an average rising rate of more than 0 003 yr as seen from fig 9 h there is a relatively poor negative correlation between twsc and ndvi r 0 38 p 0 1 this result indicates that the annual twsc is the least sensitive to ndvi changes as compared to precipitation and pet in the yrb the relationships between twsc and different factors from climatic variability and ndvi in eight subregions are depicted respectively in table 4 at the same time twsc shows a good correlation with p pet and pet p in most subregions except the lower reaches region viii where only one weather station is located fig 1 note that ndvi is affected by both climatic variability and human activities which is found to have an insignificant role in twsc except the middle and lower part of the large basin where the policy of grain for green project was launched in 1999 5 3 effect of human activities on twsc the influence of human activities on twsc are represented by two different patterns the negative contribution of water loss due to water withdrawals and the positive contribution of water gains impounded by reservoirs therefore we investigate the relationships between twsc and reservoir water storage change rc and water withdrawals ww in the yrb at yearly scale based on the data provided by water resources bulletin of the yellow river as for the influence of other human activities such as terraces or check dams we have not taken them into consideration in this study owing to the absence of related data 5 3 1 water withdrawals with the rapid development of society and economy there is a rising demand for water resources in the yrb for example the total water withdrawals of this study region has increased up to 412 km3 yr from 336 km3 yr an increase of approximately 25 during the study period shown in fig 10 from 2003 to 2015 a rapid water withdrawals rise for agriculture and industry can also be identified within the yrb the magnitudes of which is ranging from 236 3 km3 yr to 292 9 km3 yr and 40 8 km3 yr to 57 4 km3 yr respectively notably the water withdrawals for irrigation account for the majority of the total water withdrawals because the yrb represents an important agricultural area for wheat and corn in china therefore large quantities of groundwater are needed for irrigation according to previous studies zhang et al 2019a huang et al 2015c long term overexploitation of groundwater has been accelerating the rate of depleting tws in the yrb and its neighbor regions such as ncp even resulting a funnel shaped depression in the groundwater table fig 11 a and b show that twsc may decrease more severely when water withdrawals are higher r 0 40 p 0 1 5 3 2 reservoir operation some studies have investigated the twsc induced by the operation of large reservoirs such as the three gorges reservoir located in the yangtze river or the longyangxia reservoir located in the upper stream of yellow river yi et al 2017 wang et al 2011 xie et al 2018 their results show that the operation of reservoir can exert a profound influence in the local water storage and therefore are regarded as important indicators of anthropogenic impacts on environments there are different kinds of reservoir operation in the yrb for irrigation water supply as well as power generation especially since the implementation of water sediment regulation schemes wsrs for sediment reduction and flood control started in year 2002 kong et al 2015 therefore it is not enough to only consider the effect of water withdrawals when analyzing the causes of tws variations we speculate that the large scale reservoir operation may play an important role in twsc especially in the local regions where large reservoirs are located the variable that describes reservoir operation can be represented as reservoir water storage change rc in this study seen from fig 11 c and d variations in reservoir water storage have a wide range from 81 7 km3 yr to 134 6 km3 yr here positive values denote water impoundment while negative values denote water discharge in reservoirs and can greatly influence twsc in the yrb for example the water storage in reservoirs accounted for 70 and 52 of the total runoff in 2003 and 2005 respectively shown in fig s2 meanwhile fig 11 d further shows the relationship between annual twsc and reservoir water storage change in the yrb the results indicate that reservoir water storage change is highly correlated with the twsc r 0 85 p 0 01 the integrated effect of water withdrawals and reservoir operation on twsc is also shown in fig 11 e and f overall the human activities including water withdrawals and reservoir operation here have a negative effect on tws variations r 0 79 p 0 01 the relationships between different factors from human activities and twsc in eight subregions are also depicted in table 5 water withdrawals show a good correlation with twsc at yearly scale in most of the regions except region i and region ii where limited human activities are found rc has a good correlation in most of the subregions from the yrb however it presents a relative poor correlation with twsc in region iii and v because only few reservoirs are located in these regions shown in s2 in addition twsc responds well to the integrated effect of ww and rc in all subregions 5 4 contributions of different factors to twsc the contributions of different factors from climatic variability and human activities including water withdrawals and reservoir operation to twsc have been analyzed based on the proposed index presented in section 4 4 in general the bigger η value of a single factor the more contribution it makes to the total tws variations the computed contributions are depicted in table 6 according to the results shown in table 6 climatic variability is an important factor influencing twsc among all factors in most subregions in addition the water withdrawals have a significant effect on twsc especially in the middle and lower reaches where large quantities of water are needed for irrigation or industry with the increasing water demand in the yrb it may make a greater contribution to twsc in these regions under the implementation of water sediment regulation scheme annual water storage in reservoirs vary frequently with the water discharge or impoundment induced by reservoir operation these changes can play an important role in the local tws variations especially in regions where large reservoirs are located for example longyangxia reservoir the largest reservoir within the yellow river yi et al 2017 is located in region i and exerts a profound effect on the twsc for this region as for the entire yrb the reservoir water storage change accounts for a relatively small part compared to the other factors mentioned above 6 discussion 6 1 donimating fators for twsc in the study region as depicted in table 6 and fig 12 i climatic variability and water withdrawals are the dominating factors that affect the twsc across the entire yrb although reservoir operation plays a relative small role compared to climatic variability it still can t be neglected when analyzing the contributions of different factors to twsc for the yrb especially in some subregions such as region i and region vii according to the results depicted in table 3 6 and figs 9 12 the values of the index η may vary from region to region under the joint effects of human activities and climatic variability in general climatic variability can exert a significant effect on twsc in all subregions especially in regions where infrequent human activities exist while the contributions of human activities including reservoir operation and water withdrawals to twsc in different subregions have obvious spatial heterogeneity for example longyangxia reservoir located in region i and xiaolangdi reservoir located in region vii are two major reservoirs located in the yrb which account for the majority of annual water storage changes induced by water sediment regulation schemes jin et al 2019 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 as shown in fig 12 a fig 12 g and fig s3 b reservoir operation plays a vital role in twsc for region i and region vii with higher values of η r than the other regions water withdrawals is another important factor that can significantly affect twsc in the majority of subregions except region i which is a sparsely populated basin because of the harsh environmental and climatic conditions as seen from fig 12 and fig s3 a it should be noted that the contributions of water withdrawals to twsc are larger in middle and lower reaches than that in the upper reach of the yellow river 6 2 contributions of precipitation and pet to twscc the twsc induced by climatic variability twsc c mainly consists of precipitation induced twsc twsc p and pet induced twsc twsc pet therefore twsc pet can be estimated by the difference between twsc c and twsc p seen from fig 13 both precipitation and pet can exert a significant effect on twsc c over the study regions with high values of η w or η r however the contribution of precipitation is slightly higher than that of pet to twsc induced by climatic variability across the entire yrb given that only few glaciers are located in the study regions most upper reach of the basin precipitation is almost the sole source of water storage increase for the yrb however the factors that lead to a decrease in water storage may include pet and water withdrawals for various human activities such as agricultural irrigation and industrial production li et al 2017a 2017b although this index can provide good insights into the relationships between climatic variability and twsc more attentions should still be given to the mechanism about how climatic variability influences tws variations 6 3 uncertainties and limitations in this study grace data have been proven to be a useful tool to determine the mass change in tws through the relatively large regions over 200 000 km2 however cautions should still be taken when applying the grace data to detecting the tws variations in some small scale subregions such as region viii due to its coarse spatial resolution in previous studies grace data have been successfully downscaled or resampled to a finer resolution for better applications in the medium and small scale catchments seyoum and milewski 2017 abiy and melesse 2017 for example abiy and melesse 2017 applied the grace data csr rl05 to estimating the net tws variations in the tana basin ethiopia with a catchment area of 15 000 km2 by a resampling method in this study we mainly care about the trend of tws variation and the original grace data is simply resampled into 0 1 to reduce the uncertainty and error induced by its sparse spatial resolution according to abiy and melesse 2017 when computing the new contribution index human activities only include the most important ones i e water withdrawals and reservoir operation other human activities including artificial check dams and terraces are not taken into account due to the absence of related data although previous studies indicate that the effectiveness of check dams have gradually decreased since the 2000 s as they are progressively filled with eroded materials wang et al 2015 it can still inevitably play a role in twsc in particular in the middle reach of the basin in spite of the mentioned uncertainties and limitations the results presented in our study provide a regional scale evaluation of tws variation in the yrb and quantify the main contributions to twsc in its subregions for more accurate estimation of tws variations a thorough consideration of all human activities is proposed in our next study to fully understand the complex underlying mechanism for tws variations 7 conclusions in the past decade tremendous changes have taken place in the yrb about tws due to the joint effects of climatic variability and human activities however the dearth of information about in situ observations extremely limited our understanding of the dynamic variations in tws this study aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal distributions of tws across the yrb during 2003 2015 using the grace data meanwhile the twsc and its link to climatic variability ndvi as well as human activities were also investigated the contributions to twsc from climatic variability and human activities were presented based on a new index the major conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 grace based estimates indicate that twsa in the yrb has undergone a sharp decrease at a rate of 4 64 1 4 mm yr during the past decade this is consistent with the depletion of groundwater which shows a similar rate of 4 2 1 0 mm yr as compared to tws variations in addition there exists a strong spatial heterogeneity in tws variations across the entire yrb grace derived water storages are found to decrease significantly in the middle and lower reaches where there are heavily irrigated areas whereas a slight increasing trend is observed in the upper reaches 2 for climatic variables there is a good consistency between twsc and variations in precipitation and pet with correlation coefficients of 0 76 and 0 63 respectively in the yrb in addition there is also a high correlation coefficient of 0 78 with the climatic dryness index pet p although the relationship between ndvi and twsc is not significant r 0 38 across the entire study region ndvi plays an important role in the middle and lower reaches with r ranging from 0 42 to 0 74 3 for human activities twsc in the yrb shows a better relationship with reservoir water storage change r 0 85 than water withdrawals r 0 4 with the increasing demand in water supply human activities may account for an increasing proportion of twsc it is also noteworthy that the effect of reservoir water storage change on twsc should not be neglected especially in the regions where large reservoirs are located such as region i and vii 4 a simple but effective index is proposed to assess the contributions of different factors to twsc in this study the results show that the primary causes of the twsc vary from region to region which depends on the characteristics of climate and the degree of human activities including water withdrawals and reservoir operation in different regions with rapid development of human society water shortage is becoming more prominent especially in the dense populated regions such as the yrb this study can serve as a good basis for understanding twsc in the yrb and provide valuable guidance for decisions makers in making right polices for water resources assessments more studies are also needed to further estimate the tws variations when detailed human activities data are available author

6082,effective water quality management requires full understanding of the nonpoint source nps pollutant pathways however the spatial scaling effect has become one key barrier for the estimation of baseflow nps pollutants in this study the scaling effect of baseflow nps pollutants was investigated the soil and water assessment tool was used for flow and nps pollutants simulation at nested river sections while the baseflow nps pollutants was then estimated based on 17 levels of nested watersheds in a watershed of china the results indicated that as the spatial scale increased the baseflow became an important pathway of nps pollutants as its average contribution increased from 0 27 in the small headwater catchment to 0 45 in the nested large watershed the scaling effects of the baseflow index bfi and the contribution of the baseflow nps pollutants were closely related to the land use distribution among those upstream catchments whereas for the mainstream the tributary inflow would become another important reason for the scaling effect furthermore the spatial scaling effect of the bfi was less obvious during the dry period whereas the spatial scaling of the baseflow nps pollutants did not show much difference among different hydrological periods keywords spatial scaling effect nonpoint source pollution uncertainty baseflow soil and water assessment tool pathway 1 introduction as one major water quality threat the management of nonpoint source nps pollution requires full understanding of its generation transportation and water quality effects ford et al 2018 miller et al 2017 in general the surface runoff subsurface flow and groundwater represent three important pathways for nps pollutants export at the watershed scale baker and showers 2019 hu et al 2019 however the pathways of the nps pollutants by which pollutants are transported from their generation plots into water bodies are less studied which makes the control of nps pollution at the watershed scale less efficient he and lu 2016 miller et al 2017 the streamflow data at a specific river section represent the integrated signal of upstream surface runoff and baseflow while the baseflow could be defined as groundwater and the portion of interflow moving slowly through the subsoil and from other delayed sources bosch et al 2017 singh et al 2019 in many regions the baseflow sustains the basic river functions but also contributes to water quality deterioration especially in watersheds with heavy groundwater contamination miller et al 2017 schilling et al 2018 wang et al 2015 rasiah et al 2013 and rodríguez blanco et al 2013 reported that the baseflow contributed to approximately 52 and 59 of the no3 n pollution in the mulgrave river catchment and the corbeira catchment respectively hu et al 2019 also found that baseflow contributed over 70 of the water and nitrogen n in southeastern china in these previous studies lee et al 2018 luo et al 2012 the baseflow data are typically estimated by tracer based methods non tracer based methods and hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat or the groundwater modeling system gms however it is hard to obtain the accurate baseflow nps pollutants because of the lack of baseflow water quality data instead the most common assumption is that the measured water quality data during the dry season or when concentration data collected on days when daily discharge consisted of 90 100 baseflow could be used as a substitute of the baseflow water quality schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 moreover the lower limit was also set as 80 by some researchers vanni et al 2001 in addition baseflow nps pollutants could be simulated through physical based models by imitating multiple hydrological processes and nutrient cycles lee et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 these developments have provided basic tools for the estimation of baseflow nps pollutants however understanding contributions of baseflow and surface nps pollutants at multiple scales are still challenging due to the lack of a proper method limited observation data as well as the spatial and temporal variabilities of those specific processes miller et al 2017 schilling et al 2018 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 scaling effect has been identified as one key barrier to the understanding of the contribution of baseflow nps pollutants schilling et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the baseflow processes varied across spatial scales fischer et al 2015 peralta tapia et al 2015 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 found that the baseflow comprised 17 and 42 of the total flow at the headwater catchment and at the entire basin peralta tapia et al 2015 also demonstrated an increasing contribution of the baseflow with the increase of the basin area recently constructing nested watershed nw which represents several upstream downstream river sections within a watershed has provided a basic unit for analyzing the spatial scaling effect of hydrological law for example tunaley et al 2017 used three nested catchments to evaluate the nutrient dynamics along different spatial scales levi et al 2018 estimated the retention delivery of nutrient in seven nested catchments and their results showed that the delivered fraction was scale dependent these insights also indicated that the baseflow nps pollutants might also be impacted by the scaling effects peralta tapia et al 2015 to our knowledge it is still not clear how the baseflow and the related baseflow nps pollutants change along different spatial scales questions have been raised regarding 1 what the contribution of baseflow nps is to river total nitrogen tn load and 2 what the change of the baseflow nps pollutants is across multiple spatial scales in this study we focused on the contribution of the baseflow nps pollutants across different spatial scales and investigated the potential mechanism of the scaling effect the following tasks have been

and data collection in this study the daning river watershed 108 44 110 11 e 31 04 31 44 n which is located in the central part of the three gorges reservoir area china fig 2 was selected as the study area the daning river watershed forms a drainage area of approximately 2027 km2 and has four major tributaries the annual precipitation of study area ranges within 1030 mm 1950 mm with a mean value of 1182 mm though most of the rainfall occurs in may to september due to the influences of the monsoon the study area is humid with a high moisture content soil the annual average runoff at ningqiao ningchang and wuxi hydrological gauges inside the watershed is 7 108 m3 4 108 m3 and 17 108 m3 respectively due to the intense agricultural activities in this region the daning river watershed is dominated by agricultural nps pollutants chen et al 2015 shen et al 2013 and n is selected as our target nps pollutant in this study the database used in this study is shown in supporting information specifically the weather data from 2009 to 2016 were collected at 10 rainfall gauges within a 10 km radius of the study area the digital elevation model dem data were prepared using a digital map with a 50 m grid resolution more than 95 of the area is covered by mountains while the altitude of this region ranges from 200 m to 2588 m and decreases from northwest to southeast the land use data were categorized as agricultural land grassland water forest orchard and urban land detailed information can be found in our previous studies shen et al 2013 2015 in this study the daily stream flow was automatically monitored from 2009 to 2015 at the ningqiao and ningchang hydrological gauges and from 2009 to 2016 at the wuxi hydrological gauge the water quality data was sampled manually at monthly intervals from 2010 to 2016 at the wuxi hydrological gauge li et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 the tn was observed via potassium persulfate digestion spectrophotometry huang et al 2016 all the observations were obtained according to state standard monitoring and analyzing methods state environmental protection administration 2002 under strict data control by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources china available at http www cjh com cn 2 2 the generation of nested watersheds based on geographic theory a watershed can be broken down into a distinct stream network and a corresponding number of subwatersheds chen et al 2019 where the landscape was structured as dendritic drainage network using the d8 algorithm of gis software arcmap 10 2 2 the study area was delineated into 80 subwatersheds based on dem 50 m 50 m according to the inflow of tributaries the relationship between upstream and downstream could be found in supporting information 17 levels of nws were defined fig 3 more characteristics of nws could be found in supporting information specifically from the 1st level nw to the 17th level nw the average elevation gradually decreased from 2202 6 m to 1280 8 m and the percentage of forest and agricultural land increased from 28 1 to 63 1 and 7 0 to 24 2 respectively the drainage density of the 1st level nw was 0 25 km 1 while those of other nws were between 0 17 and 0 20 km 1 2 3 the simulation of flow and the pollutant data series at multiple scales the swat model version 2012 was used to quantify the flow and nps n at multiple spatial scales swat is a physical based model from the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 which could provide the hydrological cycle and nutrient balance at the hydrological response unit hru level amin et al 2017 based on the water balance equation the surface runoff evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater were simulated by the swat model for groundwater cycle swat simulates shallow and deep aquifers in each subwatershed but groundwater that enters the deep aquifer is assumed to flow outside of the watershed arnold et al 1993 the water balance for the shallow aquifer is 1 a q sh i a q sh i 1 w rchrg s h q gw w revap w pump s h where a q sh i and a q sh i 1 are the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer on day i and day i 1 mm h2o respectively w rchrg s h is the amount of recharge entering the shallow aquifer on day i mm h2o q gw is the groundwater flow into the main channel on day i mm h2o w revap is the amount of water moving into the soil zone in response to water deficiencies on day i mm h2o and w pump s h is the amount of water removed from the shallow aquifer by pumping on day i mm h2o the soil conservation service scs curve method was used to compute the surface runoff amount in addition the plant canopy which is a function of the density of plant cover and the morphology of the plant species affects the hydrological cycle in terms of infiltration surface runoff and evapotranspiration multiple n processes such as atmospheric deposition decomposition denitrification immobilization mineralization crop uptake and leaching were also considered plant use of n is estimated using the supply and demand approach while nitrate and organic n are also removed from the soil via flow of water more details on swat can be found in neitsch et al 2011 in this study a global sensitivity analysis was performed to select sensitive parameters prior to calibrating the model both of the sensitivity analysis and calibration were performed by the sufi 2 algorithm of the swat cup software abbaspour 2008 in addition the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens was selected to quantify the fitness between the observed and simulated data nash and sutcliffe 1970 the ens values were quantified as 0 47 0 50 and 0 52 for the daily flow simulation at the ningqiao ningchang and wuxi hydrological gauges respectively and ens value was quantified as 0 4 for tn at the wuxi hydrological gauge more details regarding the sensitivity analysis and calibration could be found in supporting information finally the flow and the tn data series were simulated at different spatial scales and were used for the following analysis 2 4 the estimation of the baseflow nps pollutants at multiple scales in this study the baseflow was defined as part of the total river flow that was contributed by the shallow aquifer to the main channel that was defined by swat neitsch et al 2011 considering the attenuation of water in the confluence process the baseflow amount at specific river section was estimated by multiplying the total flow and the baseflow index bfi which are defined as the baseflow proportion of the total streamflow and could be used as a useful indicator of flow pathways gustard et al 1992 tesoriero et al 2013 this indicator was calculated as the contribution of lateral flow and groundwater to river flow for all nws 2 bf i j i 1 m gw q i l a t q i a i i 1 m gw q i l a t q i s u r q i a i 3 q baseflow j b f i j q streamflow j where j j 1 2 17 is the level of nw q streamflow j is the average daily runoff m3 s at the outlet of the j level nw m is the number of upstream subwatersheds that are contained in the j level nw a i is the area of the ith subwatershed that is contained in the j level nw sur q i gw q i and lat q i are the contribution mm km2 of the surface runoff groundwater and lateral flow to the river runoff of the ith subwatershed respectively and q baseflow j m3 s is the average monthly baseflow then the subset of the streamflow and water quality data when the baseflow is equal to or over 90 of the daily streamflow schilling and zhang 2004 was selected as a substitute of the baseflow water quality the average baseflow tn concentration was then obtained by using the following equation 4 c baseflow j f 1 k 1 n loa d streamflow j k 1 n q streamflow j where loa d streamflow j kg and q streamflow j m3 s are the simulated n loads and streamflow at the outlet of the n level nw on days when the bfi 0 9 n is the number of days in the month when the bfi 0 9 c baseflow j mg l is the average monthly tn concentration in the baseflow and f 1 0 012 is a dimensionality conversion coefficient next the contribution of the surface runoff and the baseflow nps pollutants to the receiving water bodies could be calculated 5 loa d baseflow j f 2 c baseflow j q baseflow j 6 loa d surfaceflow j l o a d streamflow j l o a d baseflow j l o a d po int s o u r c e j where loa d baseflow j loa d streamflow j loa d po int s o u r c e j and loa d surfaceflow j kg are the average monthly tn loads of the baseflow total river flow point source and surface runoff respectively and f 2 86 4 is a dimensionality conversion coefficient as no point source pressures exist in the study area the point source loads were not considered during the calculation in this study then eq 7 can be simplified as 7 loa d surfaceflow j l o a d streamflow j l o a d baseflow j finally the baseflow and baseflow nps pollutants data at these 17 spatial scales within the watershed were obtained 2 5 the analysis of scaling effects in this study four indicators including the baseflow baseflow nps load baseflow index bfi and contribution rate cr of the baseflow nps pollution were calculated for each spatial scale the bfi was expressed as the contribution of the lateral flow and the groundwater to river runoff the cr was calculated as the proportion of nps pollutants delivered into water bodies though the baseflow over a specified period to minimize the influence of hydrological conditions the indicators at different months and hydrological periods were calculated and compared in addition the mean value mv the standard deviations sd extremes ratio er max min and coefficients of variation cv sd mv of these four indicators were compared across those 17 spatial scales specifically the average monthly bfi value was calculated using equation 8 spearman s rank correlation coefficient which is resistant to the effects of nonlinearity and outliers clow et al 2018 was also used to evaluate the correlation of the monthly bfi and baseflow nps cr of all nws all the statistical analyses were conducted with origin 9 0 software originlab corporation and spss 20 0 statistical software 8 bfi j i 1 n q baseflow i 1 n q streamflow where bfi j is the average monthly baseflow index for many years and n is the number of months 3 results 3 1 the spatial scaling effect of the baseflow as shown in fig 4 a there is a positive linear correlation between the averaged baseflow which was calculated using monthly data from 2009 to 2016 and the drainage area of 17 nested watersheds with the increase in the spatial scale the baseflow increases significantly price 2011 the averaged baseflow in the headwater small watershed does not exceed 10 m3 s while the baseflow in the whole watershed can reach up to 70 m3 s the determination coefficients of the linear fitting curve are greater than 0 98 see detailed information in supporting information which indicated the spatial scale could explain the variation of baseflow in the nested watershed for every 100 km2 increase in the drainage area the averaged baseflow increased by 0 6 to 2 8 m3 s besides the difference in the averaged baseflow among months increased with the increasing spatial scale this is also indicated by the variation of baseflow which was calculated as the cv value using monthly data from 2009 to 2016 the cv of the baseflow is the largest being greater than 0 5 for all months in the headwater watershed with a drainage area of 80 km2 the cv value then decreases as the spatial scale increases this indicated that rainfall would show greater impacts on baseflow for those headwater watersheds in terms of both the average value and the cv value as shown in fig 4c when the drainage area is less than 500 km2 the averaged bfi calculated using the monthly data from 2009 to 2016 varies greatly from month to month when the drainage area is between 500 and 800 km2 the averaged bfi showed an obvious increasing trend but its cv decreased as drainage area increased the averaged bfi shows slight increase when the drainage area is approximately 1500 km2 and almost stays stable among years when the drainage area further increased to 2500 km2 the averaged bfi decreases slightly but the cv values increases slightly in addition for all spatial scales the averaged bfi in the dry period nov feb is obviously larger than those in other periods in general from the headwater small watershed to the final outlet of the basin the baseflow significantly increased while the bfi generally increased the average bfi were greater than 0 59 in all nested catchments which indicated that higher contribution of baseflow in sustaining the streamflow in this region the variation of the baseflow and the related bfi among years decreased with the increasing spatial scale which indicated that a more stable response of baseflow to rainfall in larger watersheds 3 2 the spatial scaling effect of nps pollutants pathways similar to the baseflow there is also a positive linear correlation between the averaged baseflow tn load fig 5 a and the drainage area the determination coefficients of the linear fitting curve are greater than 0 9 except in april which is 0 77 see details in supporting information it is estimated that for every 100 km2 increase in the drainage area within the nested watershed the averaged baseflow nps load increased by 16 8 to 118 6 kg the difference in the averaged baseflow tn load among months increased with the increasing spatial scale indicating an increasing influence of rainfall on the baseflow nps with the increase in the spatial scale the variation of the baseflow nps which was calculated as the cv values using monthly data from 2009 to 2016 decreased first and then changed slightly fig 5b the variation of the baseflow nps is the largest greater than 0 5 in the headwater small watershed all of which are when the drainage area increased from 500 km2 to 800 km2 within the scope of the tributary xixi river the variation of the baseflow nps shows no obvious change moreover the variation of the baseflow nps are lower for the main stream than that of its upstream tributary which indicated that rainfall have the greater impacts on the baseflow nps for those upstream small watersheds with the increase in the spatial scale the averaged cr of baseflow n which was calculated using monthly data from 2009 to 2016 shows a complex trend first decreasing then increasing finally slightly changing fig 5c unlike the bfi there is no obvious changing trend for the averaged cr between 500 and 800 km2 the averaged baseflow n cr varies significantly from month to month and that in the dry period is higher than those in other periods for most spatial scales the averaged baseflow n cr in dry period is greater than 0 4 which indicates that baseflow is an important pathway of nps pollutants in this period moreover the cr increases as the spatial scale increases although the baseflow contributed to over half of the river flow the surface runoff was still the main pathway due to the higher tn concentration in the surface runoff fig 5d demonstrates that the cv of the baseflow n cr first decreased and then did not changed with the increasing spatial scale this indicates that the variation in the baseflow n cr is smaller in the large scale watershed in general from the headwater small watershed to the outlet of the basin the baseflow nps load increased significantly while the cr values increased generally the average baseflow n cr ranged from 0 27 to 0 45 which is larger than that of the bfi although the cvs of the baseflow nps load and cr were larger than those of the baseflow and the bfi these values also decreased as the spatial scale increased showing a decreasing impact of rainfall on baseflow nps in those large watersheds 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism relating to the spatial scaling effect in this section we further focused on the contribution of the baseflow nps pollutants across different spatial scales and investigated the potential mechanism of the spatial scaling effect for the hydrological cycle it remains challenging to clearly explain how multiple factors e g rainfall vegetation evapotranspiration and infiltration influence the bfi value singh et al 2019 the results of this study highlighted the importance of rainfall on baseflow nps especially for those upstream headwater watersheds on the one hand the headwater watershed has a small drainage area resulting in a relatively rapid and direct response to rainfall on the other hand the drainage density in the headwater watershed is a bit higher which agrees with previous studies of ouyang et al 2018 and price 2011 for the baseflow n cr when the drainage area was between 500 and 800 km2 the bfi showed an increasing trend and its difference among hydrological periods decreased this is probably due to the increase in the forest proportion at these spatial scales forest soils act as sponges and conduit for rainfall and thus recharge the groundwater and sustain the baseflow price 2011 singh et al 2016 wu et al 2015 found that forestation increased the total water yield but reduced surface runoff in mountainous areas other studies also showed that forest cover has a positive effect on the baseflow which is associated with a high infiltration and recharge of the basin subsurface storage ma et al 2009 price 2011 in addition there are some other studies found that the scaling effect of baseflow was probably a consequence of nested groundwater flow systems pacheco et al 2018 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 however the deep groundwater is also assumed to leave the watershed system as one loss term the nested groundwater flow theory has limitation in explaining the results of this study the difference in the baseflow nps pollutants cr among hydrological periods also decreased however within this range of spatial scale the baseflow n cr did not show an obvious spatial scaling effect although the bfi increased this could be explained by the decreasing baseflow n concentration which is consistent with the study by huang et al 2014 who found that forest showed significant negative correlation with the baseflow nitrate for the forest land n can be uptake by woodland preventing baseflow n export and decreasing the baseflow n concentration from this spatial range it is concluded that for those upstream catchments the scaling effect of the bfi and the baseflow nps pollutants were closely related to the land use distribution the tributary input was identified as another important reason for the spatial scaling effect for the large scale watersheds the bfi of the main tributaries was estimated and shown in supporting information due to the inflow of the dongxi river the variation in the bfi differed greatly between 800 and 1500 km2 and 500 800 km2 because the dongxi river discharged into the mainstream at the river section controlling a drainage area around 800 km2 based on the results obtained from this study the bfi of the dongxi river is close to that of xixi river therefore the bfi of the 11th nested nw is close to that of the 10th nw however the baseflow n cr of the 11th nested nw is higher than that of the 10th nw this could be explained by the fact that the proportion of forest stayed stable changed only 1 within this spatial scale but the agricultural land increased by 14 the nitrate n loading increased as agricultural coverage increased due to the application of fertilizer and other chemicals ahearn et al 2005 huang et al 2014 the bfi of the houxi river discharged into the mainstream at the river section controlling a drainage area around 1500 km2 is a bit lower than that of 13th nested nw which resulted in an obvious drop of bfi when the drainage area changed from 1500 to 2012 km2 the baseflow n cr showed a more obvious decrease than the bfi which was related to the changing proportion of agricultural land within the spatial range when the drainage area changed from 2012 to 2500 km2 the bfi showed a slight drop along the mainstream because the bfi of the baiyang river discharged into the mainstream at the river section controlling a drainage area around 2012 km2 is slightly lower than that of 15th nested nw however there was no significant change in the cr of the baseflow pollutants within this spatial scale range which was related to the offsetting effect between the increasing baseflow tn concentration caused by the increase in agricultural land percentage and the decrease in the bfi based on above reasons it could be found that land use distribution represents the main reason of spatial scaling effect in headwater catchments while tributary input is identified as another important reason for those mainstream watersheds 4 2 the spatial scaling effect of baseflow nps during different rainfall periods scaling effect has been identified as one key barrier to the understanding of the contribution of baseflow nps pollutants schilling et al 2018 but few studies have explored the impacts of rainfall on the spatial scaling effect of baseflow nps pollutants fischer et al 2015 peralta tapia et al 2015 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 based on the results it is clear that the baseflow and baseflow nps processes varied across different spatial scales increased by 0 6 to 2 8 m3 s and 16 8 to 118 6 kg for every 100 km2 increase in the drainage area within the nested watershed besides this variation is greatly impacted by rainfall input for the study area january february november and december are regarded as the dry period while march april september and october are regarded as the normal period and may to august are regarded as the wet period in this section we further compared the results between these three different rainfall periods from fig 6 a and c it is obvious that the baseflow and the baseflow nps in the dry period were less than those in normal and wet periods from the headwater to the watershed outlet the differences in the baseflow and the baseflow nps load among hydrological periods increased from 3 2 m3 s and 47 7 kg to 25 1 m3 s and 1693 7 kg this could be explained by the differences in rainfall and infiltration amounts during different hydrological periods this indicated that as the spatial scale increased the variation among different hydrological periods increased fig 6b demonstrates that the difference in the bfi among hydrological periods also shows an overall decreasing trend as the spatial scale increased while the difference in the cr of nps pollutants generally shows a decreasing trend first and then a slight change fig 6d it is worth noting that the spatial scaling effect of the bfi was less obvious during the dry period which might be because less rainfall and vegetation occurred during this period the spatial scaling effect of nps pollutants in terms of baseflow cr did not show an obvious difference among hydrological periods indicating the importance of managing baseflow nps for all hydrological periods the impacts of rainfall on scaling effect could be explained by the runoff generation mechanism due to the mountainous relief and tense plant cover the runoff generation mechanism of study area is identified as the excess of storage so the runoff generated when the soil approaches the saturation state in this region rainfall saturates the soil infiltrates into the subsurface and eventually discharges into streams as baseflow furthermore this region is dominated by a subtropical monsoonal climate with most of the annual rainfall occurring during may to september when rainfall is abundant in wet and normal periods larger surplus water is available as storage which results in larger baseflow and smaller bfi mello et al 2019 therefore the average bfi in the dry periods is larger than those in the wet and normal periods which is consistent with previous studies mello et al 2019 singh et al 2019 thus the averaged baseflow and the bfi were similar between the wet and normal periods while the baseflow n cr was higher in the wet period than that in normal period this could be due to the n leaching effect that was caused by relatively heavy rainfall gao et al 2014 n is mobilized and subsequently transported into deeper soil layers by flow thereby heavy rainfall increased the runoff and triggered an increase in n leaching especially during extreme rainfall gao et al 2013 2014 4 3 implications of this study as shown above the baseflow is identified as an important pathway of nps pollutants especially during the dry period with the cr of baseflow nps to the total river tn ranging from 27 4 to 44 9 at different river sections this result is consistent with previous study which reported high baseflow nps pollutants contributions to riverine loads hu et al 2019 however the contributions of baseflow nps loads have varied greatly among different studies for example wang et al 2015 showed that the contributions of the baseflow to no3 n loading during the fallow season november april reached up to 40 3 annual average 36 5 and 38 4 annual average 27 3 in two small agricultural catchments in subtropical china hu et al 2018 found that the baseflow contribution of nps n in the fallow season mean 86 was higher than during other months mean 74 in a mesoscale watershed in southeastern china owing to the positive correlation between the bfi and the baseflow nps pollutants cr tesoriero et al 2013 the baseflow contribution is usually higher in watersheds with a high bfi furthermore due to the difference in natural characteristics geographical rainfall pattern land use and hydrological response features of different watersheds the contribution of the baseflow to nps loading varies among different watersheds ahiablame et al 2017 huang et al 2014 however based on both previous studies and the results obtained from this study the baseflow nps should be highlighted to implement effective water quality strategies the management of both surface and subsurface flow pathways needed to be performed baker and showers 2019 by considering the spatial scaling effect priorities should be given to those large scale watersheds our results indicated that the contribution of baseflow tn increased from 27 to 45 from the headwater small watershed to the outlet of the watershed this means the baseflow was a more important pathway for nps pollutants in larger watersheds although the baseflow contributed to most of the river flow the surface runoff was still the main pathway for nps n due to the attenuation of leaching n within different soil layers thus integrated management of nps pollutants transferred from both surface flow and baseflow is suggested for these relatively large basins besides it is worth noting that the baseflow and baseflow nps loading dynamics were closely associated with varying land use and rainfall patterns management of the baseflow nps pollution should be paid more attentions during the dry period based on this study the forest would be a good source measure for the control of the baseflow pollution which is consistent with previous studies ahearn et al 2005 huang et al 2014 souza et al 2013 strategies such as reforestation would be effective in both surface and baseflow nps management 4 4 uncertainty of the results it should be noted that this research was conducted in a humid mountainous watershed and the results of this study can be extended to those basins with similar rainfall landuse and soil characteristics however it should be noted that the estimation of the baseflow nps are influenced by many factors such as the difference in data source the basic algorithm and water quality assumption firstly although the swat model provide the basic flow and water quality data for the studied nested watershed there is still uncertainty in swat model for example the conceptual linear one reservoir shallow aquifer storage approach was used for baseflow simulation for the swat luo et al 2012 and the deep groundwater is also assumed to leave the watershed system as one loss term which would lead to uncertainty in the baseflow load estimation construction of integrated model would be an effective way to reduce this kind of uncertainty for example swat could be linked to a fully distributed groundwater model e g modflow wei et al 2018 which considers groundwater processes using darcy s law besides parameters associated with groundwater and lateral flow such as the recession parameter alpha factor a direct index of the baseflow response to change in the recharge of the shallow aquifer could be estimated by other observation data lee et al 2018 the tracer based results which provide accurate information through chemical signatures could be used as the substitute of the swat yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 further study is suggested to use more monitoring water quality data integrate complex groundwater model and introduce tracer based sampling results for a more accurate quantification of baseflow nps pollutants for other uncertain sources the water quality assumption got the least attention although a 90 lower limit has been adopted in many previous studies schilling and zhang 2004 schilling et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the selection of the lower limit of baseflow percentage 90 was rather subjective schilling and zhang 2004 to assess the uncertainty caused by this hypothesis the 95 and 99 lower limits were also compared in this study as shown in fig 7 and fig 5c most of the average cr decreased as the lower limit increased while the difference in the average cr among months also decreased furthermore as the lower limit varied this trend did not change obviously with the spatial scale which indicated that the 90 lower limit could capture most contributions of baseflow nps however it is hard to judge which lower limit condition is best among these three thus tracer based study is encouraged in the future as a reference of water quality assumption 5 conclusion in this study the spatial scaling effect of the baseflow nps and its potential mechanism were investigated among 17 levels of nws the results indicated that the pathway of the nps pollutant changed with the spatial scale and the baseflow would become a more important pathway of the nps pollutant as the spatial scale increased from the headwater catchment to the large watershed the contribution of baseflow nps increased from 27 to 45 but the rainfall showed a decreasing impact furthermore the spatial scaling effect of the bfi and the baseflow nps was related to the land use distribution among those upstream small catchments but was also impacted by the tributary inflow effect for those large watersheds these finding also indicated that the spatial scaling effect of the bfi was less obvious during the dry period whereas that of the baseflow nps cr did not show a significant difference among hydrological periods the results of this study would provide a comprehensive understanding of the transportation of nps pollutants especially in large or complex watersheds however due to the limitation of objective conditions this study did not capture all the underlying mechanics and the complex scaling effect of the baseflow nps pollutants future studies are suggested for high frequency monitoring data and tracer based methods across time and spatial scales which can also be used to identify main factors of baseflow nps pollution and reduce the prediction uncertainty declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

6082,effective water quality management requires full understanding of the nonpoint source nps pollutant pathways however the spatial scaling effect has become one key barrier for the estimation of baseflow nps pollutants in this study the scaling effect of baseflow nps pollutants was investigated the soil and water assessment tool was used for flow and nps pollutants simulation at nested river sections while the baseflow nps pollutants was then estimated based on 17 levels of nested watersheds in a watershed of china the results indicated that as the spatial scale increased the baseflow became an important pathway of nps pollutants as its average contribution increased from 0 27 in the small headwater catchment to 0 45 in the nested large watershed the scaling effects of the baseflow index bfi and the contribution of the baseflow nps pollutants were closely related to the land use distribution among those upstream catchments whereas for the mainstream the tributary inflow would become another important reason for the scaling effect furthermore the spatial scaling effect of the bfi was less obvious during the dry period whereas the spatial scaling of the baseflow nps pollutants did not show much difference among different hydrological periods keywords spatial scaling effect nonpoint source pollution uncertainty baseflow soil and water assessment tool pathway 1 introduction as one major water quality threat the management of nonpoint source nps pollution requires full understanding of its generation transportation and water quality effects ford et al 2018 miller et al 2017 in general the surface runoff subsurface flow and groundwater represent three important pathways for nps pollutants export at the watershed scale baker and showers 2019 hu et al 2019 however the pathways of the nps pollutants by which pollutants are transported from their generation plots into water bodies are less studied which makes the control of nps pollution at the watershed scale less efficient he and lu 2016 miller et al 2017 the streamflow data at a specific river section represent the integrated signal of upstream surface runoff and baseflow while the baseflow could be defined as groundwater and the portion of interflow moving slowly through the subsoil and from other delayed sources bosch et al 2017 singh et al 2019 in many regions the baseflow sustains the basic river functions but also contributes to water quality deterioration especially in watersheds with heavy groundwater contamination miller et al 2017 schilling et al 2018 wang et al 2015 rasiah et al 2013 and rodríguez blanco et al 2013 reported that the baseflow contributed to approximately 52 and 59 of the no3 n pollution in the mulgrave river catchment and the corbeira catchment respectively hu et al 2019 also found that baseflow contributed over 70 of the water and nitrogen n in southeastern china in these previous studies lee et al 2018 luo et al 2012 the baseflow data are typically estimated by tracer based methods non tracer based methods and hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat or the groundwater modeling system gms however it is hard to obtain the accurate baseflow nps pollutants because of the lack of baseflow water quality data instead the most common assumption is that the measured water quality data during the dry season or when concentration data collected on days when daily discharge consisted of 90 100 baseflow could be used as a substitute of the baseflow water quality schilling and zhang 2004 wang et al 2015 moreover the lower limit was also set as 80 by some researchers vanni et al 2001 in addition baseflow nps pollutants could be simulated through physical based models by imitating multiple hydrological processes and nutrient cycles lee et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 these developments have provided basic tools for the estimation of baseflow nps pollutants however understanding contributions of baseflow and surface nps pollutants at multiple scales are still challenging due to the lack of a proper method limited observation data as well as the spatial and temporal variabilities of those specific processes miller et al 2017 schilling et al 2018 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 scaling effect has been identified as one key barrier to the understanding of the contribution of baseflow nps pollutants schilling et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the baseflow processes varied across spatial scales fischer et al 2015 peralta tapia et al 2015 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 found that the baseflow comprised 17 and 42 of the total flow at the headwater catchment and at the entire basin peralta tapia et al 2015 also demonstrated an increasing contribution of the baseflow with the increase of the basin area recently constructing nested watershed nw which represents several upstream downstream river sections within a watershed has provided a basic unit for analyzing the spatial scaling effect of hydrological law for example tunaley et al 2017 used three nested catchments to evaluate the nutrient dynamics along different spatial scales levi et al 2018 estimated the retention delivery of nutrient in seven nested catchments and their results showed that the delivered fraction was scale dependent these insights also indicated that the baseflow nps pollutants might also be impacted by the scaling effects peralta tapia et al 2015 to our knowledge it is still not clear how the baseflow and the related baseflow nps pollutants change along different spatial scales questions have been raised regarding 1 what the contribution of baseflow nps is to river total nitrogen tn load and 2 what the change of the baseflow nps pollutants is across multiple spatial scales in this study we focused on the contribution of the baseflow nps pollutants across different spatial scales and investigated the potential mechanism of the scaling effect the following tasks have been performed 1 the contribution of the baseflow nps pollutants was simulated at 17 spatial scales in a nested watershed of china 2 the spatial scaling effect of the baseflow nps pollutants was investigated 3 the uncertainty relating to several important assumptions relating to the baseflow nps estimation was discussed 2 methodology and materials the flowchart of the integrated method was proposed and shown in fig 1 first detailed basic data were collected and compiled as the model inputs second the sensitive parameters were calibrated and the simulated flow and tn data series were obtained at 17 levels of nws third estimation of the baseflow and baseflow nps pollutants at these multiple spatial scales finally scaling effects were analyzed and compared 2 1 watershed description and data collection in this study the daning river watershed 108 44 110 11 e 31 04 31 44 n which is located in the central part of the three gorges reservoir area china fig 2 was selected as the study area the daning river watershed forms a drainage area of approximately 2027 km2 and has four major tributaries the annual precipitation of study area ranges within 1030 mm 1950 mm with a mean value of 1182 mm though most of the rainfall occurs in may to september due to the influences of the monsoon the study area is humid with a high moisture content soil the annual average runoff at ningqiao ningchang and wuxi hydrological gauges inside the watershed is 7 108 m3 4 108 m3 and 17 108 m3 respectively due to the intense agricultural activities in this region the daning river watershed is dominated by agricultural nps pollutants chen et al 2015 shen et al 2013 and n is selected as our target nps pollutant in this study the database used in this study is shown in supporting information specifically the weather data from 2009 to 2016 were collected at 10 rainfall gauges within a 10 km radius of the study area the digital elevation model dem data were prepared using a digital map with a 50 m grid resolution more than 95 of the area is covered by mountains while the altitude of this region ranges from 200 m to 2588 m and decreases from northwest to southeast the land use data were categorized as agricultural land grassland water forest orchard and urban land detailed information can be found in our previous studies shen et al 2013 2015 in this study the daily stream flow was automatically monitored from 2009 to 2015 at the ningqiao and ningchang hydrological gauges and from 2009 to 2016 at the wuxi hydrological gauge the water quality data was sampled manually at monthly intervals from 2010 to 2016 at the wuxi hydrological gauge li et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 the tn was observed via potassium persulfate digestion spectrophotometry huang et al 2016 all the observations were obtained according to state standard monitoring and analyzing methods state environmental protection administration 2002 under strict data control by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources china available at http www cjh com cn 2 2 the generation of nested watersheds based on geographic theory a watershed can be broken down into a distinct stream network and a corresponding number of subwatersheds chen et al 2019 where the landscape was structured as dendritic drainage network using the d8 algorithm of gis software arcmap 10 2 2 the study area was delineated into 80 subwatersheds based on dem 50 m 50 m according to the inflow of tributaries the relationship between upstream and downstream could be found in supporting information 17 levels of nws were defined fig 3 more characteristics of nws could be found in supporting information specifically from the 1st level nw to the 17th level nw the average elevation gradually decreased from 2202 6 m to 1280 8 m and the percentage of forest and agricultural land increased from 28 1 to 63 1 and 7 0 to 24 2 respectively the drainage density of the 1st level nw was 0 25 km 1 while those of other nws were between 0 17 and 0 20 km 1 2 3 the simulation of flow and the pollutant data series at multiple scales the swat model version 2012 was used to quantify the flow and nps n at multiple spatial scales swat is a physical based model from the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 which could provide the hydrological cycle and nutrient balance at the hydrological response unit hru level amin et al 2017 based on the water balance equation the surface runoff evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater were simulated by the swat model for groundwater cycle swat simulates shallow and deep aquifers in each subwatershed but groundwater that enters the deep aquifer is assumed to flow outside of the watershed arnold et al 1993 the water balance for the shallow aquifer is 1 a q sh i a q sh i 1 w rchrg s h q gw w revap w pump s h where a q sh i and a q sh i 1 are the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer on day i and day i 1 mm h2o respectively w rchrg s h is the amount of recharge entering the shallow aquifer on day i mm h2o q gw is the groundwater flow into the main channel on day i mm h2o w revap is the amount of water moving into the soil zone in response to water deficiencies on day i mm h2o and w pump s h is the amount of water removed from the shallow aquifer by pumping on day i mm h2o the soil conservation service scs curve method was used to compute the surface runoff amount in addition the plant canopy which is a function of the density of plant cover and the morphology of the plant species affects the hydrological cycle in terms of infiltration surface runoff and evapotranspiration multiple n processes such as atmospheric deposition decomposition denitrification immobilization mineralization crop uptake and leaching were also considered plant use of n is estimated using the supply and demand approach while nitrate and organic n are also removed from the soil via flow of water more details on swat can be found in neitsch et al 2011 in this study a global sensitivity analysis was performed to select sensitive parameters prior to calibrating the model both of the sensitivity analysis and calibration were performed by the sufi 2 algorithm of the swat cup software abbaspour 2008 in addition the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens was selected to quantify the fitness between the observed and simulated data nash and sutcliffe 1970 the ens values were quantified as 0 47 0 50 and 0 52 for the daily flow simulation at the ningqiao ningchang and wuxi hydrological gauges respectively and ens value was quantified as 0 4 for tn at the wuxi hydrological gauge more details regarding the sensitivity analysis and calibration could be found in supporting information finally the flow and the tn data series were simulated at different spatial scales and were used for the following analysis 2 4 the estimation of the baseflow nps pollutants at multiple scales in this study the baseflow was defined as part of the total river flow that was contributed by the shallow aquifer to the main channel that was defined by swat neitsch et al 2011 considering the attenuation of water in the confluence process the baseflow amount at specific river section was estimated by multiplying the total flow and the baseflow index bfi which are defined as the baseflow proportion of the total streamflow and could be used as a useful indicator of flow pathways gustard et al 1992 tesoriero et al 2013 this indicator was calculated as the contribution of lateral flow and groundwater to river flow for all nws 2 bf i j i 1 m gw q i l a t q i a i i 1 m gw q i l a t q i s u r q i a i 3 q baseflow j b f i j q streamflow j where j j 1 2 17 is the level of nw q streamflow j is the average daily runoff m3 s at the outlet of the j level nw m is the number of upstream subwatersheds that are contained in the j level nw a i is the area of the ith subwatershed that is contained in the j level nw sur q i gw q i and lat q i are the contribution mm km2 of the surface runoff groundwater and lateral flow to the river runoff of the ith subwatershed respectively and q baseflow j m3 s is the average monthly baseflow then the subset of the streamflow and water quality data when the baseflow is equal to or over 90 of the daily streamflow schilling and zhang 2004 was selected as a substitute of the baseflow water quality the average baseflow tn concentration was then obtained by using the following equation 4 c baseflow j f 1 k 1 n loa d streamflow j k 1 n q streamflow j where loa d streamflow j kg and q streamflow j m3 s are the simulated n loads and streamflow at the outlet of the n level nw on days when the bfi 0 9 n is the number of days in the month when the bfi 0 9 c baseflow j mg l is the average monthly tn concentration in the baseflow and f 1 0 012 is a dimensionality conversion coefficient next the contribution of the surface runoff and the baseflow nps pollutants to the receiving water bodies could be calculated 5 loa d baseflow j f 2 c baseflow j q baseflow j 6 loa d surfaceflow j l o a d streamflow j l o a d baseflow j l o a d po int s o u r c e j where loa d baseflow j loa d streamflow j loa d po int s o u r c e j and loa d surfaceflow j kg are the average monthly tn loads of the baseflow total river flow point source and surface runoff respectively and f 2 86 4 is a dimensionality conversion coefficient as no point source pressures exist in the study area the point source loads were not considered during the calculation in this study then eq 7 can be simplified as 7 loa d surfaceflow j l o a d streamflow j l o a d baseflow j finally the baseflow and baseflow nps pollutants data at these 17 spatial scales within the watershed were obtained 2 5 the analysis of scaling effects in this study four indicators including the baseflow baseflow nps load baseflow index bfi and contribution rate cr of the baseflow nps pollution were calculated for each spatial scale the bfi was expressed as the contribution of the lateral flow and the groundwater to river runoff the cr was calculated as the proportion of nps pollutants delivered into water bodies though the baseflow over a specified period to minimize the influence of hydrological conditions the indicators at different months and hydrological periods were calculated and compared in addition the mean value mv the standard deviations sd extremes ratio er max min and coefficients of variation cv sd mv of these four indicators were compared across those 17 spatial scales specifically the average monthly bfi value was calculated using equation 8 spearman s rank correlation coefficient which is resistant to the effects of nonlinearity and outliers clow et al 2018 was also used to evaluate the correlation of the monthly bfi and baseflow nps cr of all nws all the statistical analyses were conducted with origin 9 0 software originlab corporation and spss 20 0 statistical software 8 bfi j i 1 n q baseflow i 1 n q streamflow where bfi j is the average monthly baseflow index for many years and n is the number of months 3 results 3 1 the spatial scaling effect of the baseflow as shown in fig 4 a there is a positive linear correlation between the averaged baseflow which was calculated using monthly data from 2009 to 2016 and the drainage area of 17 nested watersheds with the increase in the spatial scale the baseflow increases significantly price 2011 the averaged baseflow in the headwater small watershed does not exceed 10 m3 s while the baseflow in the whole watershed can reach up to 70 m3 s the determination coefficients of the linear fitting curve are greater than 0 98 see detailed information in supporting information which indicated the spatial scale could explain the variation of baseflow in the nested watershed for every 100 km2 increase in the drainage area the averaged baseflow increased by 0 6 to 2 8 m3 s besides the difference in the averaged baseflow among months increased with the increasing spatial scale this is also indicated by the variation of baseflow which was calculated as the cv value using monthly data from 2009 to 2016 the cv of the baseflow is the largest being greater than 0 5 for all months in the headwater watershed with a drainage area of 80 km2 the cv value then decreases as the spatial scale increases this indicated that rainfall would show greater impacts on baseflow for those headwater watersheds in terms of both the average value and the cv value as shown in fig 4c when the drainage area is less than 500 km2 the averaged bfi calculated using the monthly data from 2009 to 2016 varies greatly from month to month when the drainage area is between 500 and 800 km2 the averaged bfi showed an obvious increasing trend but its cv decreased as drainage area increased the averaged bfi shows slight increase when the drainage area is approximately 1500 km2 and almost stays stable among years when the drainage area further increased to 2500 km2 the averaged bfi decreases slightly but the cv values increases slightly in addition for all spatial scales the averaged bfi in the dry period nov feb is obviously larger than those in other periods in general from the headwater small watershed to the final outlet of the basin the baseflow significantly increased while the bfi generally increased the average bfi were greater than 0 59 in all nested catchments which indicated that higher contribution of baseflow in sustaining the streamflow in this region the variation of the baseflow and the related bfi among years decreased with the increasing spatial scale which indicated that a more stable response of baseflow to rainfall in larger watersheds 3 2 the spatial scaling effect of nps pollutants pathways similar to the baseflow there is also a positive linear correlation between the averaged baseflow tn load fig 5 a and the drainage area the determination coefficients of the linear fitting curve are greater than 0 9 except in april which is 0 77 see details in supporting information it is estimated that for every 100 km2 increase in the drainage area within the nested watershed the averaged baseflow nps load increased by 16 8 to 118 6 kg the difference in the averaged baseflow tn load among months increased with the increasing spatial scale indicating an increasing influence of rainfall on the baseflow nps with the increase in the spatial scale the variation of the baseflow nps which was calculated as the cv values using monthly data from 2009 to 2016 decreased first and then changed slightly fig 5b the variation of the baseflow nps is the largest greater than 0 5 in the headwater small watershed all of which are when the drainage area increased from 500 km2 to 800 km2 within the scope of the tributary xixi river the variation of the baseflow nps shows no obvious change moreover the variation of the baseflow nps are lower for the main stream than that of its upstream tributary which indicated that rainfall have the greater impacts on the baseflow nps for those upstream small watersheds with the increase in the spatial scale the averaged cr of baseflow n which was calculated using monthly data from 2009 to 2016 shows a complex trend first decreasing then increasing finally slightly changing fig 5c unlike the bfi there is no obvious changing trend for the averaged cr between 500 and 800 km2 the averaged baseflow n cr varies significantly from month to month and that in the dry period is higher than those in other periods for most spatial scales the averaged baseflow n cr in dry period is greater than 0 4 which indicates that baseflow is an important pathway of nps pollutants in this period moreover the cr increases as the spatial scale increases although the baseflow contributed to over half of the river flow the surface runoff was still the main pathway due to the higher tn concentration in the surface runoff fig 5d demonstrates that the cv of the baseflow n cr first decreased and then did not changed with the increasing spatial scale this indicates that the variation in the baseflow n cr is smaller in the large scale watershed in general from the headwater small watershed to the outlet of the basin the baseflow nps load increased significantly while the cr values increased generally the average baseflow n cr ranged from 0 27 to 0 45 which is larger than that of the bfi although the cvs of the baseflow nps load and cr were larger than those of the baseflow and the bfi these values also decreased as the spatial scale increased showing a decreasing impact of rainfall on baseflow nps in those large watersheds 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism relating to the spatial scaling effect in this section we further focused on the contribution of the baseflow nps pollutants across different spatial scales and investigated the potential mechanism of the spatial scaling effect for the hydrological cycle it remains challenging to clearly explain how multiple factors e g rainfall vegetation evapotranspiration and infiltration influence the bfi value singh et al 2019 the results of this study highlighted the importance of rainfall on baseflow nps especially for those upstream headwater watersheds on the one hand the headwater watershed has a small drainage area resulting in a relatively rapid and direct response to rainfall on the other hand the drainage density in the headwater watershed is a bit higher which agrees with previous studies of ouyang et al 2018 and price 2011 for the baseflow n cr when the drainage area was between 500 and 800 km2 the bfi showed an increasing trend and its difference among hydrological periods decreased this is probably due to the increase in the forest proportion at these spatial scales forest soils act as sponges and conduit for rainfall and thus recharge the groundwater and sustain the baseflow price 2011 singh et al 2016 wu et al 2015 found that forestation increased the total water yield but reduced surface runoff in mountainous areas other studies also showed that forest cover has a positive effect on the baseflow which is associated with a high infiltration and recharge of the basin subsurface storage ma et al 2009 price 2011 in addition there are some other studies found that the scaling effect of baseflow was probably a consequence of nested groundwater flow systems pacheco et al 2018 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 however the deep groundwater is also assumed to leave the watershed system as one loss term the nested groundwater flow theory has limitation in explaining the results of this study the difference in the baseflow nps pollutants cr among hydrological periods also decreased however within this range of spatial scale the baseflow n cr did not show an obvious spatial scaling effect although the bfi increased this could be explained by the decreasing baseflow n concentration which is consistent with the study by huang et al 2014 who found that forest showed significant negative correlation with the baseflow nitrate for the forest land n can be uptake by woodland preventing baseflow n export and decreasing the baseflow n concentration from this spatial range it is concluded that for those upstream catchments the scaling effect of the bfi and the baseflow nps pollutants were closely related to the land use distribution the tributary input was identified as another important reason for the spatial scaling effect for the large scale watersheds the bfi of the main tributaries was estimated and shown in supporting information due to the inflow of the dongxi river the variation in the bfi differed greatly between 800 and 1500 km2 and 500 800 km2 because the dongxi river discharged into the mainstream at the river section controlling a drainage area around 800 km2 based on the results obtained from this study the bfi of the dongxi river is close to that of xixi river therefore the bfi of the 11th nested nw is close to that of the 10th nw however the baseflow n cr of the 11th nested nw is higher than that of the 10th nw this could be explained by the fact that the proportion of forest stayed stable changed only 1 within this spatial scale but the agricultural land increased by 14 the nitrate n loading increased as agricultural coverage increased due to the application of fertilizer and other chemicals ahearn et al 2005 huang et al 2014 the bfi of the houxi river discharged into the mainstream at the river section controlling a drainage area around 1500 km2 is a bit lower than that of 13th nested nw which resulted in an obvious drop of bfi when the drainage area changed from 1500 to 2012 km2 the baseflow n cr showed a more obvious decrease than the bfi which was related to the changing proportion of agricultural land within the spatial range when the drainage area changed from 2012 to 2500 km2 the bfi showed a slight drop along the mainstream because the bfi of the baiyang river discharged into the mainstream at the river section controlling a drainage area around 2012 km2 is slightly lower than that of 15th nested nw however there was no significant change in the cr of the baseflow pollutants within this spatial scale range which was related to the offsetting effect between the increasing baseflow tn concentration caused by the increase in agricultural land percentage and the decrease in the bfi based on above reasons it could be found that land use distribution represents the main reason of spatial scaling effect in headwater catchments while tributary input is identified as another important reason for those mainstream watersheds 4 2 the spatial scaling effect of baseflow nps during different rainfall periods scaling effect has been identified as one key barrier to the understanding of the contribution of baseflow nps pollutants schilling et al 2018 but few studies have explored the impacts of rainfall on the spatial scaling effect of baseflow nps pollutants fischer et al 2015 peralta tapia et al 2015 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 based on the results it is clear that the baseflow and baseflow nps processes varied across different spatial scales increased by 0 6 to 2 8 m3 s and 16 8 to 118 6 kg for every 100 km2 increase in the drainage area within the nested watershed besides this variation is greatly impacted by rainfall input for the study area january february november and december are regarded as the dry period while march april september and october are regarded as the normal period and may to august are regarded as the wet period in this section we further compared the results between these three different rainfall periods from fig 6 a and c it is obvious that the baseflow and the baseflow nps in the dry period were less than those in normal and wet periods from the headwater to the watershed outlet the differences in the baseflow and the baseflow nps load among hydrological periods increased from 3 2 m3 s and 47 7 kg to 25 1 m3 s and 1693 7 kg this could be explained by the differences in rainfall and infiltration amounts during different hydrological periods this indicated that as the spatial scale increased the variation among different hydrological periods increased fig 6b demonstrates that the difference in the bfi among hydrological periods also shows an overall decreasing trend as the spatial scale increased while the difference in the cr of nps pollutants generally shows a decreasing trend first and then a slight change fig 6d it is worth noting that the spatial scaling effect of the bfi was less obvious during the dry period which might be because less rainfall and vegetation occurred during this period the spatial scaling effect of nps pollutants in terms of baseflow cr did not show an obvious difference among hydrological periods indicating the importance of managing baseflow nps for all hydrological periods the impacts of rainfall on scaling effect could be explained by the runoff generation mechanism due to the mountainous relief and tense plant cover the runoff generation mechanism of study area is identified as the excess of storage so the runoff generated when the soil approaches the saturation state in this region rainfall saturates the soil infiltrates into the subsurface and eventually discharges into streams as baseflow furthermore this region is dominated by a subtropical monsoonal climate with most of the annual rainfall occurring during may to september when rainfall is abundant in wet and normal periods larger surplus water is available as storage which results in larger baseflow and smaller bfi mello et al 2019 therefore the average bfi in the dry periods is larger than those in the wet and normal periods which is consistent with previous studies mello et al 2019 singh et al 2019 thus the averaged baseflow and the bfi were similar between the wet and normal periods while the baseflow n cr was higher in the wet period than that in normal period this could be due to the n leaching effect that was caused by relatively heavy rainfall gao et al 2014 n is mobilized and subsequently transported into deeper soil layers by flow thereby heavy rainfall increased the runoff and triggered an increase in n leaching especially during extreme rainfall gao et al 2013 2014 4 3 implications of this study as shown above the baseflow is identified as an important pathway of nps pollutants especially during the dry period with the cr of baseflow nps to the total river tn ranging from 27 4 to 44 9 at different river sections this result is consistent with previous study which reported high baseflow nps pollutants contributions to riverine loads hu et al 2019 however the contributions of baseflow nps loads have varied greatly among different studies for example wang et al 2015 showed that the contributions of the baseflow to no3 n loading during the fallow season november april reached up to 40 3 annual average 36 5 and 38 4 annual average 27 3 in two small agricultural catchments in subtropical china hu et al 2018 found that the baseflow contribution of nps n in the fallow season mean 86 was higher than during other months mean 74 in a mesoscale watershed in southeastern china owing to the positive correlation between the bfi and the baseflow nps pollutants cr tesoriero et al 2013 the baseflow contribution is usually higher in watersheds with a high bfi furthermore due to the difference in natural characteristics geographical rainfall pattern land use and hydrological response features of different watersheds the contribution of the baseflow to nps loading varies among different watersheds ahiablame et al 2017 huang et al 2014 however based on both previous studies and the results obtained from this study the baseflow nps should be highlighted to implement effective water quality strategies the management of both surface and subsurface flow pathways needed to be performed baker and showers 2019 by considering the spatial scaling effect priorities should be given to those large scale watersheds our results indicated that the contribution of baseflow tn increased from 27 to 45 from the headwater small watershed to the outlet of the watershed this means the baseflow was a more important pathway for nps pollutants in larger watersheds although the baseflow contributed to most of the river flow the surface runoff was still the main pathway for nps n due to the attenuation of leaching n within different soil layers thus integrated management of nps pollutants transferred from both surface flow and baseflow is suggested for these relatively large basins besides it is worth noting that the baseflow and baseflow nps loading dynamics were closely associated with varying land use and rainfall patterns management of the baseflow nps pollution should be paid more attentions during the dry period based on this study the forest would be a good source measure for the control of the baseflow pollution which is consistent with previous studies ahearn et al 2005 huang et al 2014 souza et al 2013 strategies such as reforestation would be effective in both surface and baseflow nps management 4 4 uncertainty of the results it should be noted that this research was conducted in a humid mountainous watershed and the results of this study can be extended to those basins with similar rainfall landuse and soil characteristics however it should be noted that the estimation of the baseflow nps are influenced by many factors such as the difference in data source the basic algorithm and water quality assumption firstly although the swat model provide the basic flow and water quality data for the studied nested watershed there is still uncertainty in swat model for example the conceptual linear one reservoir shallow aquifer storage approach was used for baseflow simulation for the swat luo et al 2012 and the deep groundwater is also assumed to leave the watershed system as one loss term which would lead to uncertainty in the baseflow load estimation construction of integrated model would be an effective way to reduce this kind of uncertainty for example swat could be linked to a fully distributed groundwater model e g modflow wei et al 2018 which considers groundwater processes using darcy s law besides parameters associated with groundwater and lateral flow such as the recession parameter alpha factor a direct index of the baseflow response to change in the recharge of the shallow aquifer could be estimated by other observation data lee et al 2018 the tracer based results which provide accurate information through chemical signatures could be used as the substitute of the swat yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 further study is suggested to use more monitoring water quality data integrate complex groundwater model and introduce tracer based sampling results for a more accurate quantification of baseflow nps pollutants for other uncertain sources the water quality assumption got the least attention although a 90 lower limit has been adopted in many previous studies schilling and zhang 2004 schilling et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the selection of the lower limit of baseflow percentage 90 was rather subjective schilling and zhang 2004 to assess the uncertainty caused by this hypothesis the 95 and 99 lower limits were also compared in this study as shown in fig 7 and fig 5c most of the average cr decreased as the lower limit increased while the difference in the average cr among months also decreased furthermore as the lower limit varied this trend did not change obviously with the spatial scale which indicated that the 90 lower limit could capture most contributions of baseflow nps however it is hard to judge which lower limit condition is best among these three thus tracer based study is encouraged in the future as a reference of water quality assumption 5 conclusion in this study the spatial scaling effect of the baseflow nps and its potential mechanism were investigated among 17 levels of nws the results indicated that the pathway of the nps pollutant changed with the spatial scale and the baseflow would become a more important pathway of the nps pollutant as the spatial scale increased from the headwater catchment to the large watershed the contribution of baseflow nps increased from 27 to 45 but the rainfall showed a decreasing impact furthermore the spatial scaling effect of the bfi and the baseflow nps was related to the land use distribution among those upstream small catchments but was also impacted by the tributary inflow effect for those large watersheds these finding also indicated that the spatial scaling effect of the bfi was less obvious during the dry period whereas that of the baseflow nps cr did not show a significant difference among hydrological periods the results of this study would provide a comprehensive understanding of the transportation of nps pollutants especially in large or complex watersheds however due to the limitation of objective conditions this study did not capture all the underlying mechanics and the complex scaling effect of the baseflow nps pollutants future studies are suggested for high frequency monitoring data and tracer based methods across time and spatial scales which can also be used to identify main factors of baseflow nps pollution and reduce the prediction uncertainty declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

6083,anabranching river has been recognized as an independent river pattern a variety of investigations have attempted to disclose the formation of anabranching rivers however most previous studies mainly focused on the controls of anabranching channels formation the mechanism of transition among sub channels with varying flow sediment regime in anabranching rivers has been poorly understood in this study we used multi source data sets to investigate the changes in river channels and island wugui island about 7 km2 along the 27 km long jianli reach tashiyi tianziyihao in the middle yangtze river nine landsat images 1987 1990 1994 1996 2000 2003 2006 2010 and 2014 with 30 m spatial resolution were used to map the channel planform dynamics obvious changes in channel width and morphology of the island were observed during 1987 2014 the width of the left branch had reduced from 1041 m to 340 m while the width of the right branch had increased from 632 m to 1531 m during 1994 1996 the main river channel shifted from the left branch to the right during the period of 1987 2014 the total width of the compound cross section increased and the mean length width ratio of the island increased from 3 59 to 4 32 the mean annual flow discharge increased about 9 and mean annual suspended sediment concentration and sediment transport coefficient the ratio of mean annual suspended sediment concentration to mean annul flow discharge decreased about 75 and 76 respectively from 1951 to 2009 in response to the operation of gezhouba dam and three gorges dam the meandering anabranching channel planform adjusted by narrowing the island width and enlarging compound cross section in response to upstream water sediment regime the shift of the main river channel from left branch to the right may resulted from the increase in flow discharge and decrease in sediment transport coefficient since 1980s the adjustment has been intensified by the changes in the sediment transport rate after 1995 after the main channel was switched from left branch to right branch the flow sediment diversion capacity was kept stable with a diversion percentage of 90 in right branch due to the persistent influence of the three gorges dam the right branch will function as the main channel for a long time before the meandering anabranching system achieves equilibrium the shift and stability of main channel was closely related with the relative magnitude of flow sediment partition in each branch the significance of this study is that we successfully manifested the main channel

channel island channel planform flow sediment partition three gorges dam yangtze river 1 introduction the traditional fluvial geomorphology has commonly categorized river channels as straight meandering braided patterns although a limited number of specific coding systems exist schumm 1985 rosgen 1994 the quantitative discrimination of specific channel patterns with a combination of

established from small medium sized rivers and laboratory flumes latrubesse 2008 as a further physical understanding of the fluvial processes driving channel patterns has emerged especially for large rivers the classification of classic channel planform patterns have also been challenged and modified knighton and nanson 1993 nanson and knighton 1996 millar 2000 2005 church 2006 huang and nanson

identified as one particular type relevant to big rivers nanson and knighton 1996 schumm et al 1996 church 2006 latrubesse 2008 kleinhans 2010 nicholas et al 2013 the anabranching river pattern differs braided pattern because the in channel island in anabranching river system can persist for more than decades or century tooth et al 2008 nanson 2013 anabranching rivers consist of multiple channels which generally separate flow at bankfull stage by in channel bars or islands nanson and knighton 1996 liu et al 2016 islands are a characteristic element of large rivers but they divide the flow at discharges up to bankfull latrubesse 2008 ashworth and lewin 2012 nanson 2013 a simple explanation for the occurrence of all anabranching rivers is impossible because an additional channel results from a blockage of debris flow or accumulated bed materials nanson 2013 or an avulsion caused by an exceptional flood schumm et al 1996 phillips 2009 kleinhans et al 2013 kleinhans and hardy

same elevation as the adjacent floodplain having relative resistant banks with mature vegetation cover tooth and nanson 2000 gradzinski et al 2003 tooth et al 2008 jansen and nanson 2010 pietsch and nanson 2011 the theoretical analysis and field investigation suggested that with an accompanying reduction of channel width divided channels can be more efficient at transporting sediment than single ones jansen and nanson 2004 huang and nanson 2007 jansen and nanson 2010 liu et al 2016 the main channel and accessary channel separated by in channel island commonly attain a highly asymmetrical division of flow and sediment within a few decades depending on combinations of the relevant parameters federici and paola 2003 kleinhans et al 2008 the variation in flow sediment regime has been considered to be closely related to the development of in channel island and main channel transition from one branch to another xiong and deng 1999 kleinhans et al 2006 2008 carling et al 2014 liu et al 2016 a variety of investigations have attempted to disclose the formation processes of channel island and multiple branch channels tooth and nanson 2000 federici and paola 2003 jiang et al 2006

studies got their findings from field investigation and theoretical analysis without direct hydromorphological observation moreover they mainly focused on the controls of anabranching channels formation and lacked the demonstration of the main channel shift processes as a result of varying flow sediment regime currently the mechanism between flow sediment regime and transition among sub channels in multiple channel system has been poorly understood large rivers exhibit a range of multiple channel planform combinations apart from straight meandering and braided in that large river systems are naturally composed of hydrologically and biologically interconnected assemblages of hydro geomorphic components including main accessory or tributary channels and periodically inundated floodplains latrubesse et al 2009 lewin and ashworth 2014 recent investigations have demonstrated that relative stable anabranching pattern is the ultimate end member for large rivers along their most part of alluvial tracts jansen and nanson 2004 latrubesse 2008 ashworth and lewin 2012 lewin and ashworth 2014 carling et al 2018 although the in channel islands in large rivers are relative stable the main channel is ready to shift between separate branches federici and paola 2003 in response to the flow sediment regulation federici and paola 2003 nelson et al 2013 the manifestation of the main channel shift in large anabranching rivers remains a great challenge because there is usually a lack of hydromorphological observation of main channel shift between sub channels the middle and lower yangtze river develops anabranching river system as described by latrubesse 2008 anyway they behave in different form and fluvial processes from other anabranching patterns because the branches develop just along the river bend they are quite different from the parallel anabranching river jansen and nanson 2004 or downstream meander bifurcation kleinhans et al 2008 kleinhans et al 2011 we define this type of anabranching pattern as meandering anabranching pattern in order to discriminate from others the study reach is located at jianli reach in the middle reach of the yangtze river fig 1 with the consideration that repeated channel form bathymetry and hydrometric measurements are easily obtained li et al 2006 li et al 2007 huang 2008 furthermore a number of results from physical flume experiments and numerical simulations for the jianli reach can provide insightful arguments for our investigation li 2008 fu et al 2011 wang et al 2014 xia et al 2016 in this study by means of multi source data analysis and theoretical validation we would like to answer the following two unsolved questions 1 how the anabranching meandering river channel system evolves and 2 what s the mechanism of main channel shift in anabranching river system with varying flow sediment regime the major contribution of this study is that we successfully manifested the main channel shift process of anabranching river with the support of both direct hydromorphological observation and theoretical verification 2 study reach the yangtze river originating from the tibetan plateau runs 6300 km east into the east china sea it is the largest river in china by flow discharge and length with the aim of flood mitigation hydroelectric power production and irrigation etc more than 50 000 dams with varying storage capacity have been constructed throughout the yangtze s basin since 1950 yang et al 2011 of all the dams along the main stream of the yangtze river the gezhou dam and the three gorges dam are the two largest ones the gezhou dam with a storage capacity of 1 58 109 m3 is a run of river reservoir located on the main stem of the yangtze river 38 km below the three gorges dam and was partly put into use in 1981 li et al 2011 han et al 2017 the three gorges dam located on the main stem 44 km above the end of the upper reach began to impound water and sediment discharge on 1 june 2003 having the largest storage capacity of 3 93 1010 m3 in the yangtze river basin about 4 5 of the annual runoff of the yangtze river a large body of investigations have examined the effects of the three gorges dam operation on the flow sediment transport and river channel morphological changes in different reaches downstream of the dams and found that remarkable channel adjustments have occurred in the middle and lower reach of the yangtze river since the operation of the two large dams li et al 2011 luo et al 2012 jia et al 2016 han et al 2017 xia et al 2017 dai et al 2018 li et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 the river channels in the upper reach of the middle yangtze river was scoured significantly with no obvious variation in width the jianli reach located in the upper reach of the middle yangtze river is approximately 27 km long from tashiyi to tianziyihao which is composed of the curved jianli reach and the new shangchewan channel formed by the channel straightening in 1969 fig 1 the jianli reach is a typical meandering anabranching river channel with two branches with an average sinuosity of 1 72 wugui island a large in channel island with the surface elevation higher than bankfull level separates the flow through the river channel on its both sides an artificial cutoff in the zhongzhouzi bend and a natural cutoff of the shatanzi bend upstream occurred in 1967 and july of 1972 respectively fig 1 the river bed material in this reach is composed of medium fine sand with a mean median diameter of 0 18 mm with underlying gravel deposition the river banks have a typical two layer structure the lower layer usually consisting of non cohesive medium fine sand up to 30 m in thickness and the upper layer consisting of cohesive silty clay or loam only a few meters in thickness xia et al 2017 to prevent large floods levees have been constructed along both sides of the river bank rocky outcrops exist on tashiyi which make the right bank erosion resistant and stable huang 2008 3 data and methods 3 1 data 3 1 1 remote sensing data the landsat mission is the longest running program for acquisition of satellite imagery of earth launched jointly by nasa usgs

level 1 products from different instrument sensors to investigate the channel planform change table 1 in addition to minimize the influence of water level on island and river channel extents we chose images acquired when water level is nearly bankfull eventually nine images acquired in 1987 1990 1994 1996 2000 2003 2006 2010 and 2014 were selected table 1 it is shown that the water level on the acquisition date of each image was between 29 m and 31 m and the flow discharge is close to the bankfull discharge of 22 000 m3 s 3 1 2 hydrological data we used mean monthly flow discharge m3 s and mean monthly sediment concentration kg m3 from the jianli hydrological station to examine the temporal change of flow sediment regime under the regulation of large dams and engineering works artificial meander cutoff all hydrological data were provided by the changjiang yangtze water resource commission cwrc mean monthly suspended sediment transport rate kg s was calculated using the monthly water discharge and monthly sediment concentration the mean annual flow discharge and mean annual suspended sediment transport rate was calculated from the monthly data the hydrological data sets for flow discharge and suspended sediment concentration were missing during the two period july 1960 march 1966 and 1970 1974 because the jianli hydrological station was out of service to reconstruct a continuous long term series data sets we replaced the missing data from 1960 to 1966 with the data observed at the upstream xinchang hydrological station and with diverting flow discharge and suspended sediment load observed at the ouchikou hydrological station we replaced the missing data from 1970 to 1974 with data observations from the hongshan hydrological station the locations of these hydrological stations are shown in fig 1 the hydrological data length ranged from 1951 to 2009 3 2 methods 3 2 1 remote sensing data processing the spectral band selection and combination for multispectral imagery affects the visual interpretation and information extraction the reflection and adsorption behavior between water and plants are completely different in the near infrared spectrum and the middle infrared spectrum water has high absorbability and absorbs almost all the energy while the reflected energy is lower plants and soil in the two spectra have low absorbability but high reflection these observations allow water and vegetation to be easily distinguished in the near infrared spectrum and the middle infrared spectrum according to field observations plants and vegetation covered most of the island surface and farmland is the dominant surface feature on the river bank therefore bands 7 5 and 1 were selected for tm images to extract water boundaries and bands 7 6 and 2 were selected for oli images envi 4 7 and arcgis10 1 were used to map the river channel and island morphology because the study area is not very large we used the manually digitalizing mapping methods to delineate the river channel and island and then calculate the length width and area 3 2 2 hydrological analysis the non parametric mann kendall test has been widely used to detect a trend of hydrologic variables gocic and trajkovic 2013 kisi and ay 2014 if x1 x2 x3 xn is the time series of length n then the mann kendall test statistic s is given by 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where 2 s g n x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i where xi and xj are the data values at times i and j n indicates the length of the data set while a positive value of s indicates an increasing trend negative of s indicates a decreasing trend the following expression as an assumption is used for the series where the data length n 10 and data are approximately normally distributed variance r2 1 and mean l 0 value if the null hypothesis h0 that there is no trend in the time series is true s is normally distributed with the variance v s as hamed 2009 kisi and ay 2014 3 v s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups and ti denotes the number of ties of extent i a tied group is a set of sample data having the same value the standard normal test statistic z is computed as 4 z s 1 v s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v s s 0 the null hypothesis is rejected at significance level of α if z z 1 α 2 where z 1 α 2 is the value of the standard normal distribution with a probability of exceedance of α 2 a positive value of s indicates an increasing trend and vice versa test statistic z gives significance level of rejecting the null hypothesis chances of rejecting null hypothesis even if there is no trend in the dataset to identify the abrupt change point of the annual flow regime at the jianli stations accumulated departure or accumulate anomaly is adopted here hassan et al 2010 tian et al 2016 5 a n i 1 n r i r i n 1 2 3 where a n is the accumulated departure of flow events r i is the ith flow events and r i is the mean of the given flow series the breaks in the cumulative departure curve indicate the timing and response of flow events to the abrupt changes in the governing conditions 4 results and analyses 4 1 temporal changes of river channel and island morphology the results of wugui mid island from the remote sensing data were shown in table 2 and fig 2 the temporal change trend of the wugui island length width as well as left right branch width was statistically examined by using mann kendall non parametric test the results show that the maximum length of the island and the right branch width had significant increasing trends and the left branch width had a significant decreasing trend table 3 the mean width of the island showed a decreasing trend but not statistically significant from 1987 to 1990 erosion occurred on the right edge of wugui island and deposition in the form of shallow shoal on the left side figs 2 and 3 a with little adjustment of the mid island area table 2 in 1994 the scouring continued on the right edge of wugui island and the width of the right channel grew to 731 m table 2 with aggradation in the rear zone and left edge of the island the area of island increased to 7 26 km2 table 2 at the same time the left channel of the anabranching reach was gradually shrinking with obvious sediment aggradation figs 2 and 3a during the period of 1994 1996 the right edge of wugui island continued to be scoured with almost no significant deposits along the left edge figs 2 and 3a considering the water level fluctuations and the spatial resolution of the imagery the area of the island remained nearly unchanged table 2 however in 1996 the width of the right channel increased to 886 m which is 100 m wider than that of the left channel from 1987 to 1996 the moving rate of wugui island at the head and rear part was approximately 18 m a and 43 m a respectively during the period of 1996 2000 erosion continued on the right edge of wugui island with a maximum erosion width of more than 540 m while depositions along the left margin caused a northward expansion and growth of more than 220 m fig 3b the rate of change for the wugui island during the period of 1996 to 2000 was much faster than that from 1987 to 1996 the channel width of the right branch increased to more than 1200 m and the channel width of the left branch decreased to approximately 500 m table 2 and fig 4 b at that time most of the water and sediment was transported through the right branch from 2000 to 2003 the left edge of the island head extended upstream following low level deposition the right edge of island tail had slightly eroded and island adjustment slowed fig 3b meanwhile the left channel shrinkage continued with sediment aggradation and the channel width was approximately 400 m while the right channel grew and developed with to a channel width of approximately 1300 m table 2 since 2006 the channel planform of jianli reach has been stable fig 4b and the morphology of wugui island has been almost unchanged fig 3b regarding the characteristics of wugui island and jianli anbranching planform the left channel left deposits and has tended to be atrophic since 1987 while the right channel grew and developed table 2 until 1995 the width of the right channel grew increasingly larger than that of the left channel and the right branch began to functioned as the main channel during the period of 1987 1996 the area of wugui island increased and the plane area reached the maximum surface area of nearly 7 4 km2 in 1996 since 2000 the area of the island remained stable table 2 during the period of 1987 to 2014 there was a strong regularity to the morphological changes of wugui island the maximum length of the island increased while the average width of island was gradually reduced table 2 and fig 4a the length width ratio of the island greatly changed during 1995 during the period of 1980 1996 the average length width ratio was 3 49 this average value increased to 4 32 during 2000 2014 overall during the period of 1987 2014 the main branch switched from the left channel to the right channel and the island became narrower and longer with a significant increase in the length width ratio in addition during 1987 2014 there were no significant changes in the total width of the two anabranching channels which is derived from the width of the compound cross section and the average width of wugui island while there was significant change in the width of the compound cross section when the left branch functioned as the main branch the average width of the left branch was approximately 1645 m when the right branch functioned as the main branch the average width of right branch was approximately 1827 m the difference was approximately 200 m the right branch became wider than left branch after 1998 4 2 long term changes of flow sediment regime the linear regression results showed that during 1951 2009 the mean annual flow discharge was increasing fig 5 a while mean annual suspended sediment transport rate and mean annual sediment transport coefficient were initially increasing and then decreasing fig 5b c anyway the mann kendall test confirms that mean annual flow discharge had a significant increasing trend and mean annual suspended sediment transport rate and mean annual sediment transport coefficient had a totally decreasing trend table 4 although there was an increasing trend in flow discharge and a decreasing trend in sediment load during 1951 2009 the changing trend during sub period was quite different we determined the change points by using accumulated departure analyses and found that the change points for mean annual flow discharge mean annual suspended sediment transport rate and mean annual sediment transport coefficient were 1973 1991 and 1972 respectively fig 6 the change in flow sediment regimes results from a combination of river training engineering works such as artificial meander cutoffs during 1967 1972 gezhouba dam construction in 1981 and three gorges dam construction since 1999 from fig 5b and c we can find that the sediment transport rate began to decrease significantly since 1991 compared with that before the suspended sediment transport rate reduced to a minimum after 2003 when three gorges dam was put into full operation fig 7 the change point in sediment regime was basically coherent with the main channel switch during 1993 1996 fig 8 the adjustment of river channel and mid island morphology fig 4 obviously lagged behind the change in flow sediment regime fig 6 and transition between main channels fig 8 when the left branch functioned as the main channel until 1992 the percentage of flow sediment diversion in the left branch was varying during different flow discharge fig 9 a and b this may imply that the anabranching river system at this time was active and did not achieve equilibrium after the main channel was switched from left branch to right branch the percentage of flow sediment diversion in the right branch became relatively stable during different flow discharge with an average of 90 fig 9c and d both the anabranch channel width fig 4b and flow sediment diversion after main channel switch remain relative stable especially after the three gorges dam was put into operation the new relationship between flow and sediment after the three gorges dam provided a favorable condition for the new meandering anabranching river system into equilibrium by enhancing the river channel sediment transport efficiency this will be discussed in the following section 5 discussion 5 1 responses of channel planform to the flow sediment regime the switching of the main channel from one branch to another is the dominant characteristic of the channel planform dynamics of anabranching river systems and is the result of the flow dynamic axis movement in response to changes in the hydrological regime hu and hui 1995 the hydrometric measurements observed from 1951 to 2009 fig 4 showed that the mean annual flow discharge increased about 9 and suspended sediment concentration and sediment transport coefficient the ratio of suspended sediment concentration to flow discharge decreased about 75 and 76 respectively this means that the sediment transport coefficient the ratio of suspended sediment concentration to flow discharge had been becoming lower and the flow has increasing transport capacity which drove the flow dynamic axis moving towards the convex bank with a small curvature radius hu and hui 1995 the movement of the flow dynamic axis resulted in erosion of the right edge and island head of wugui island and deposition in the left edge of the island in consequence the island moved left the right channel expanded and the left channel shrunk during the period of 1994 1996 with the expansion of the right branch the right branch became wider that the left and the main channel shifted from the left branch to the right the right channel functioned as the main channel with the proportions of water and sediment discharge at more than 90 fig 9 in a meandering river the curvature radius of the flow dynamic axis was considered to be closely related to the flow discharge li 2008 zhang et al 1984 based on systematic analyses of 37 sets of cross sectional hydraulic measurements in the jingjiang reach the upper reach of the middle yangtze river during 1960s 1970s zhang et al 1984 proposed an exponential relationship between the radius of the main flow r and the ratio of flow discharge q and the channel slope s as follows 6 r q 2 s 1 3 when natural channel flow is able to reach an optimal state huang and nanson 2000 the relationship between channel slope flow discharge and sediment transport qs can be expressed as 7 s q s 0 526 q 0 678 by combining the eq 7 into eq 6 the relationship between the radius of the main flow and the ratio of flow discharge and sediment transport can be expressed as 8 r q 0 8927 q s 0 1753 eq 8 shows that the radius of the main flow axis will increase not only with an increase in flow discharge but also with a decrease in the sediment transport rate more importantly due to the flow discharge having an index of 0 8927 there is a stronger driving effect of the flow discharge than of the sediment transport rate with the index of 0 1753 the flow dynamic axis will swing following the cycle of the flow and sediment regimes in jianli reach the radius of curvature of the left branch was approximately 3500 m while the radius of curvature of the right branch was approximately 6800 m for a relative high sediment transport coefficient water flowed along the channel with a small curvature radius and by contrast water flowed along the channel with a large curvature radius therefore when the flow discharge increased and the sediment discharge remained the same or decreased since 1980s fig 10 the main flow dynamic axis of jianli reach gradually moved to the right channel with a larger radius of curvature for the meandering anabranching river system when flow discharge was relatively low and the sediment transport rate regime was high the radius would reduce and the flow and sediment transported along the left branch with a small curvature radius however when the configuration between flow and sediment regimes changed since 1992 fig 10 the radius of the main flow increased with the result that the main channel switch occurred and the right channel functioned as the main channel these phenomena show that the hydrological regime leads to the main channel switches in the jianli reach 5 2 channel planform adjustment to achieve sediment transport balance many previous studies demonstrate that the downstream river channel had complex response to upstream flow sediment regime regulation due to the impoundment of dams gregory and park 1974 petts 1979 williams and wolman 1984 chin et al 2002 hadley and emmett 1998 draut et al 2011 carley et al 2012 ma et al 2012 casado et al 2016 channel width could increase decrease or remain constant in the reach downstream from a dam petts 1979 williams and wolman 1984 and changing rate in streambed elevation and in channel width often became slowly with time williams and wolman 1984 this means that the channel morphology would adjust to accommodate the regulated flow sediment regime imposed by dam operation for the wide river channel on the low gradient floodplain riparian vegetation commonly increased in the reach downstream from the dams probably because of the decrease in peak flows friedman et al 1998 casado et al 2016 sanchis ibor et al 2019 the appearance of vegetation may lead to the formation of anabranching river from single channel river pattern to maintain an efficient conveyance of water and sediment the alluvial rivers respond to the changes in hydrological conditions by adjusting their hydraulic geometry and planform that is the variation in water and sediment conditions is the endogenous dynamic for the adjustment of channel evolution studies have shown that anabranching efficiency can be influenced by an adjustment in the width of the compound cross section huang and nanson 2007 when the width decreases the sediment transport efficiency will be significantly increased and when the width increases the sediment transport efficiency will likewise be reduced it was shown in table 5 that the relationship between the matching regimes of flow discharge and sediment load changed in 1995 from a high sediment and low water regime to high water and low sediment on the other hand during the period of 1987 2014 the width of the anabranching system did not change obvioulsy while the average width of the island was reduced approximately 200 m which led to an increase in the width of the compound cross section tables 2 and 4 to adapt to the adjustment in the changing regimes of increasing flow discharge and decreasing sediment loads in jianli reach the island tried to narrow its width and to increase the width of the compound cross section which would reduce the sediment transport efficiency and relieve the excess channel erosion therefore the adjustment in compound cross section width and island morphology may be affected by the change in flow and sediment regime 5 3 the influence of flow and sediment partition on the stability of anabranching river system from the field measurements we can find that in the main channel the percentage of sediment diversion is larger than the percentage of flow diversion fig 9 and table 6 before 1993 the left channel transported larger proportion of flow and sediment and served as the main channel table 6 and in the left channel the percentage of sediment diversion was larger than the percentage of flow diversion before 1992 since 1992 the percentage of sediment transported by left channel became lower that the percentage of flow this ultimately led to the shift of main channel from left channel to right channel in 1993 after 1993 the right channel transported more than 50 of flow and sediment and began to function as the main channel and transported more proportion of sediment load than proportion of flow however the river channel morphology showed a delayed response the mean river channel width of the right channel became larger than that of the left channel since 1996 fig 4 and table 2 the shift of main channel was closely related with the flow sediment partition rather than the channel morphology in general if the sub channel functions as the main channel it will transport more proportion of sediment than proportion of flow the relationship between flow sediment partition and channel island morphology for stable anabranching river system derived from theoretical analysis also shows that in the main channel the percentage of sediment diversion should be larger than the percentage of flow diversion liu et al 2016 if this relationship is not matched the anabranching river system will become unstable and the shift of main channel between the sub channel would happen 9 p s 1 1 p s 1 0 8143 p w 1 1 p w 1 0 8374 l 2 4 b 2 l where pw1 ps1 are the percentage of sediment diversion and percentage of flow diversion in the main channel 6 conclusion the remote sensing images of jianli reach during the period of 1987 2014 were successfully used to analyze the evolution of the meandering anabranching river planform the results showed that obvious changes occured in the channel width of the two branches from 1987 to 2014 the width of the left branch decreased from 1041 m to 340 m and the width of the right branch increased from 632 m to 1531 m the width of the compound cross section increased from 1673 m to 1871 m at the same time the morphology of wugui island underwent corresponding changes the maximum length increased and the average width decreased which led to an increase in the length width ratio of the island the main branch switched from the left channel to the right channel around 1995 the results from hydrological data analyses showed that due to the regulations of the gezhouba dam and the three gorges dam in the upstream the mean annual flow discharge increased about 9 and suspended sediment concentration and sediment transport coefficient the ratio of suspended sediment concentration to flow discharge decreased about 75 and 76 respectively from 1951 to 2009 the switches of the main channel from one to another may be caused by the increase in the flow discharge and decrease in sediment transport coefficient beginning in the 1980s which led to the flow dynamic axis moving right the adjustment was intensified by the changes in the matching regimes of flow discharge and sediment transport rate after 1995 to maintain an appropriate conveyance of water and sediment the anabranching planform responded to the change in the flow sediment regimes by narrowing the island width and increasing the width of the compound cross section the quantitative relationship between the planar morphology of meandering anabranching channel and the variation in hydrological

6083,anabranching river has been recognized as an independent river pattern a variety of investigations have attempted to disclose the formation of anabranching rivers however most previous studies mainly focused on the controls of anabranching channels formation the mechanism of transition among sub channels with varying flow sediment regime in anabranching rivers has been poorly understood in this study we used multi source data sets to investigate the changes in river channels and island wugui island about 7 km2 along the 27 km long jianli reach tashiyi tianziyihao in the middle yangtze river nine landsat images 1987 1990 1994 1996 2000 2003 2006 2010 and 2014 with 30 m spatial resolution were used to map the channel planform dynamics obvious changes in channel width and morphology of the island were observed during 1987 2014 the width of the left branch had reduced from 1041 m to 340 m while the width of the right branch had increased from 632 m to 1531 m during 1994 1996 the main river channel shifted from the left branch to the right during the period of 1987 2014 the total width of the compound cross section increased and the mean length width ratio of the island increased from 3 59 to 4 32 the mean annual flow discharge increased about 9 and mean annual suspended sediment concentration and sediment transport coefficient the ratio of mean annual suspended sediment concentration to mean annul flow discharge decreased about 75 and 76 respectively from 1951 to 2009 in response to the operation of gezhouba dam and three gorges dam the meandering anabranching channel planform adjusted by narrowing the island width and enlarging compound cross section in response to upstream water sediment regime the shift of the main river channel from left branch to the right may resulted from the increase in flow discharge and decrease in sediment transport coefficient since 1980s the adjustment has been intensified by the changes in the sediment transport rate after 1995 after the main channel was switched from left branch to right branch the flow sediment diversion capacity was kept stable with a diversion percentage of 90 in right branch due to the persistent influence of the three gorges dam the right branch will function as the main channel for a long time before the meandering anabranching system achieves equilibrium the shift and stability of main channel was closely related with the relative magnitude of flow sediment partition in each branch the significance of this study is that we successfully manifested the main channel shift process of anabranching river with the support of direct hydromorphological observation and theoretical verification keywords meandering anabranching river pattern river channel adjustment channel island channel planform flow sediment partition three gorges dam yangtze river 1 introduction the traditional fluvial geomorphology has commonly categorized river channels as straight meandering braided patterns although a limited number of specific coding systems exist schumm 1985 rosgen 1994 the quantitative discrimination of specific channel patterns with a combination of variables discharge channel gradient grain size shear stress et al has been a significant research focus during the past decades leopold and wolman 1957 van den berg 1995 millar 2000 lewin and brewer 2001 millar 2005 eaton et al 2010 with a systematic analysis of data collection from varying types of rivers and flumes however the development of knowledge about channel patterning has been established from small medium sized rivers and laboratory flumes latrubesse 2008 as a further physical understanding of the fluvial processes driving channel patterns has emerged especially for large rivers the classification of classic channel planform patterns have also been challenged and modified knighton and nanson 1993 nanson and knighton 1996 millar 2000 2005 church 2006 huang and nanson 2007 latrubesse 2008 eaton et al 2010 kleinhans 2010 liu et al 2016 beside the straight meandering braided patterns anabranching river with stable in channel island and multiple channels has been identified as one particular type relevant to big rivers nanson and knighton 1996 schumm et al 1996 church 2006 latrubesse 2008 kleinhans 2010 nicholas et al 2013 the anabranching river pattern differs braided pattern because the in channel island in anabranching river system can persist for more than decades or century tooth et al 2008 nanson 2013 anabranching rivers consist of multiple channels which generally separate flow at bankfull stage by in channel bars or islands nanson and knighton 1996 liu et al 2016 islands are a characteristic element of large rivers but they divide the flow at discharges up to bankfull latrubesse 2008 ashworth and lewin 2012 nanson 2013 a simple explanation for the occurrence of all anabranching rivers is impossible because an additional channel results from a blockage of debris flow or accumulated bed materials nanson 2013 or an avulsion caused by an exceptional flood schumm et al 1996 phillips 2009 kleinhans et al 2013 kleinhans and hardy 2013 in meandering rivers a new branch is ready to form by cut off at the neck of a loop or floodplain schumm et al 1996 judd et al 2007 the islands between the anabranch channels stand at about the same elevation as the adjacent floodplain having relative resistant banks with mature vegetation cover tooth and nanson 2000 gradzinski et al 2003 tooth et al 2008 jansen and nanson 2010 pietsch and nanson 2011 the theoretical analysis and field investigation suggested that with an accompanying reduction of channel width divided channels can be more efficient at transporting sediment than single ones jansen and nanson 2004 huang and nanson 2007 jansen and nanson 2010 liu et al 2016 the main channel and accessary channel separated by in channel island commonly attain a highly asymmetrical division of flow and sediment within a few decades depending on combinations of the relevant parameters federici and paola 2003 kleinhans et al 2008 the variation in flow sediment regime has been considered to be closely related to the development of in channel island and main channel transition from one branch to another xiong and deng 1999 kleinhans et al 2006 2008 carling et al 2014 liu et al 2016 a variety of investigations have attempted to disclose the formation processes of channel island and multiple branch channels tooth and nanson 2000 federici and paola 2003 jiang et al 2006 bertoldi and tubino 2007 duan et al 2007 huang and nanson 2007 li 2008 tooth et al 2008 he et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 2013 kleinhans et al 2011 liu et al 2011 nicholas et al 2013 however most previous studies got their findings from field investigation and theoretical analysis without direct hydromorphological observation moreover they mainly focused on the controls of anabranching channels formation and lacked the demonstration of the main channel shift processes as a result of varying flow sediment regime currently the mechanism between flow sediment regime and transition among sub channels in multiple channel system has been poorly understood large rivers exhibit a range of multiple channel planform combinations apart from straight meandering and braided in that large river systems are naturally composed of hydrologically and biologically interconnected assemblages of hydro geomorphic components including main accessory or tributary channels and periodically inundated floodplains latrubesse et al 2009 lewin and ashworth 2014 recent investigations have demonstrated that relative stable anabranching pattern is the ultimate end member for large rivers along their most part of alluvial tracts jansen and nanson 2004 latrubesse 2008 ashworth and lewin 2012 lewin and ashworth 2014 carling et al 2018 although the in channel islands in large rivers are relative stable the main channel is ready to shift between separate branches federici and paola 2003 in response to the flow sediment regulation federici and paola 2003 nelson et al 2013 the manifestation of the main channel shift in large anabranching rivers remains a great challenge because there is usually a lack of hydromorphological observation of main channel shift between sub channels the middle and lower yangtze river develops anabranching river system as described by latrubesse 2008 anyway they behave in different form and fluvial processes from other anabranching patterns because the branches develop just along the river bend they are quite different from the parallel anabranching river jansen and nanson 2004 or downstream meander bifurcation kleinhans et al 2008 kleinhans et al 2011 we define this type of anabranching pattern as meandering anabranching pattern in order to discriminate from others the study reach is located at jianli reach in the middle reach of the yangtze river fig 1 with the consideration that repeated channel form bathymetry and hydrometric measurements are easily obtained li et al 2006 li et al 2007 huang 2008 furthermore a number of results from physical flume experiments and numerical simulations for the jianli reach can provide insightful arguments for our investigation li 2008 fu et al 2011 wang et al 2014 xia et al 2016 in this study by means of multi source data analysis and theoretical validation we would like to answer the following two unsolved questions 1 how the anabranching meandering river channel system evolves and 2 what s the mechanism of main channel shift in anabranching river system with varying flow sediment regime the major contribution of this study is that we successfully manifested the main channel shift process of anabranching river with the support of both direct hydromorphological observation and theoretical verification 2 study reach the yangtze river originating from the tibetan plateau runs 6300 km east into the east china sea it is the largest river in china by flow discharge and length with the aim of flood mitigation hydroelectric power production and irrigation etc more than 50 000 dams with varying storage capacity have been constructed throughout the yangtze s basin since 1950 yang et al 2011 of all the dams along the main stream of the yangtze river the gezhou dam and the three gorges dam are the two largest ones the gezhou dam with a storage capacity of 1 58 109 m3 is a run of river reservoir located on the main stem of the yangtze river 38 km below the three gorges dam and was partly put into use in 1981 li et al 2011 han et al 2017 the three gorges dam located on the main stem 44 km above the end of the upper reach began to impound water and sediment discharge on 1 june 2003 having the largest storage capacity of 3 93 1010 m3 in the yangtze river basin about 4 5 of the annual runoff of the yangtze river a large body of investigations have examined the effects of the three gorges dam operation on the flow sediment transport and river channel morphological changes in different reaches downstream of the dams and found that remarkable channel adjustments have occurred in the middle and lower reach of the yangtze river since the operation of the two large dams li et al 2011 luo et al 2012 jia et al 2016 han et al 2017 xia et al 2017 dai et al 2018 li et al 2018 lyu et al 2019 the river channels in the upper reach of the middle yangtze river was scoured significantly with no obvious variation in width the jianli reach located in the upper reach of the middle yangtze river is approximately 27 km long from tashiyi to tianziyihao which is composed of the curved jianli reach and the new shangchewan channel formed by the channel straightening in 1969 fig 1 the jianli reach is a typical meandering anabranching river channel with two branches with an average sinuosity of 1 72 wugui island a large in channel island with the surface elevation higher than bankfull level separates the flow through the river channel on its both sides an artificial cutoff in the zhongzhouzi bend and a natural cutoff of the shatanzi bend upstream occurred in 1967 and july of 1972 respectively fig 1 the river bed material in this reach is composed of medium fine sand with a mean median diameter of 0 18 mm with underlying gravel deposition the river banks have a typical two layer structure the lower layer usually consisting of non cohesive medium fine sand up to 30 m in thickness and the upper layer consisting of cohesive silty clay or loam only a few meters in thickness xia et al 2017 to prevent large floods levees have been constructed along both sides of the river bank rocky outcrops exist on tashiyi which make the right bank erosion resistant and stable huang 2008 3 data and methods 3 1 data 3 1 1 remote sensing data the landsat mission is the longest running program for acquisition of satellite imagery of earth launched jointly by nasa usgs

level 1 products from different instrument sensors to investigate the channel planform change table 1 in addition to minimize the influence of water level on island and river channel extents we chose images acquired when water level is nearly bankfull eventually nine images acquired in 1987 1990 1994 1996 2000 2003 2006 2010 and 2014 were selected table 1 it is shown that the water level on the acquisition date of each image was between 29 m and 31 m and the flow discharge is close to the bankfull discharge of 22 000 m3 s 3 1 2 hydrological data we used mean monthly flow discharge m3 s and mean monthly sediment concentration kg m3 from the jianli hydrological station to examine the temporal change of flow sediment regime under the regulation of large dams and engineering works artificial meander cutoff all hydrological data were provided by the changjiang yangtze water resource commission cwrc mean monthly suspended sediment transport rate kg s was calculated using the monthly water discharge and monthly sediment concentration the mean annual flow discharge and mean annual suspended sediment transport rate was calculated from the monthly data the hydrological data sets for flow discharge and suspended sediment concentration were missing during the two period july 1960 march 1966 and 1970 1974 because the jianli hydrological station was out of service to reconstruct a continuous long term series data sets we replaced the missing data from 1960 to 1966 with the data observed at the upstream xinchang hydrological station and with diverting flow discharge and suspended sediment load observed at the ouchikou hydrological station we replaced the missing data from 1970 to 1974 with data observations from the hongshan hydrological station the locations of these hydrological stations are shown in fig 1 the hydrological data length ranged from 1951 to 2009 3 2 methods 3 2 1 remote sensing data processing the spectral band selection and combination for multispectral imagery affects the visual interpretation and information extraction the reflection and adsorption behavior between water and plants are completely different in the near infrared spectrum and the middle infrared spectrum water has high absorbability and absorbs almost all the energy while the reflected energy is lower plants and soil in the two spectra have low absorbability but high reflection these observations allow water and vegetation to be easily distinguished in the near infrared spectrum and the middle infrared spectrum according to field observations plants and vegetation covered most of the island surface and farmland is the dominant surface feature on the river bank therefore bands 7 5 and 1 were selected for tm images to extract water boundaries and bands 7 6 and 2 were selected for oli images envi 4 7 and arcgis10 1 were used to map the river channel and island morphology because the study area is not very large we used the manually digitalizing mapping methods to delineate the river channel and island and then calculate the length width and area 3 2 2 hydrological analysis the non parametric mann kendall test has been widely used to detect a trend of hydrologic variables gocic and trajkovic 2013 kisi and ay 2014 if x1 x2 x3 xn is the time series of length n then the mann kendall test statistic s is given by 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where 2 s g n x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i where xi and xj are the data values at times i and j n indicates the length of the data set while a positive value of s indicates an increasing trend negative of s indicates a decreasing trend the following expression as an assumption is used for the series where the data length n 10 and data are approximately normally distributed variance r2 1 and mean l 0 value if the null hypothesis h0 that there is no trend in the time series is true s is normally distributed with the variance v s as hamed 2009 kisi and ay 2014 3 v s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups and ti denotes the number of ties of extent i a tied group is a set of sample data having the same value the standard normal test statistic z is computed as 4 z s 1 v s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v s s 0 the null hypothesis is rejected at significance level of α if z z 1 α 2 where z 1 α 2 is the value of the standard normal distribution with a probability of exceedance of α 2 a positive value of s indicates an increasing trend and vice versa test statistic z gives significance level of rejecting the null hypothesis chances of rejecting null hypothesis even if there is no trend in the dataset to identify the abrupt change point of the annual flow regime at the jianli stations accumulated departure or accumulate anomaly is adopted here hassan et al 2010 tian et al 2016 5 a n i 1 n r i r i n 1 2 3 where a n is the accumulated departure of flow events r i is the ith flow events and r i is the mean of the given flow series the breaks in the cumulative departure curve indicate the timing and response of flow events to the abrupt changes in the governing conditions 4 results and analyses 4 1 temporal changes of river channel and island morphology the results of wugui mid island from the remote sensing data were shown in table 2 and fig 2 the temporal change trend of the wugui island length width as well as left right branch width was statistically examined by using mann kendall non parametric test the results show that the maximum length of the island and the right branch width had significant increasing trends and the left branch width had a significant decreasing trend table 3 the mean width of the island showed a decreasing trend but not statistically significant from 1987 to 1990 erosion occurred on the right edge of wugui island and deposition in the form of shallow shoal on the left side figs 2 and 3 a with little adjustment of the mid island area table 2 in 1994 the scouring continued on the right edge of wugui island and the width of the right channel grew to 731 m table 2 with aggradation in the rear zone and left edge of the island the area of island increased to 7 26 km2 table 2 at the same time the left channel of the anabranching reach was gradually shrinking with obvious sediment aggradation figs 2 and 3a during the period of 1994 1996 the right edge of wugui island continued to be scoured with almost no significant deposits along the left edge figs 2 and 3a considering the water level fluctuations and the spatial resolution of the imagery the area of the island remained nearly unchanged table 2 however in 1996 the width of the right channel increased to 886 m which is 100 m wider than that of the left channel from 1987 to 1996 the moving rate of wugui island at the head and rear part was approximately 18 m a and 43 m a respectively during the period of 1996 2000 erosion continued on the right edge of wugui island with a maximum erosion width of more than 540 m while depositions along the left margin caused a northward expansion and growth of more than 220 m fig 3b the rate of change for the wugui island during the period of 1996 to 2000 was much faster than that from 1987 to 1996 the channel width of the right branch increased to more than 1200 m and the channel width of the left branch decreased to approximately 500 m table 2 and fig 4 b at that time most of the water and sediment was transported through the right branch from 2000 to 2003 the left edge of the island head extended upstream following low level deposition the right edge of island tail had slightly eroded and island adjustment slowed fig 3b meanwhile the left channel shrinkage continued with sediment aggradation and the channel width was approximately 400 m while the right channel grew and developed with to a channel width of approximately 1300 m table 2 since 2006 the channel planform of jianli reach has been stable fig 4b and the morphology of wugui island has been almost unchanged fig 3b regarding the characteristics of wugui island and jianli anbranching planform the left channel left deposits and has tended to be atrophic since 1987 while the right channel grew and developed table 2 until 1995 the width of the right channel grew increasingly larger than that of the left channel and the right branch began to functioned as the main channel during the period of 1987 1996 the area of wugui island increased and the plane area reached the maximum surface area of nearly 7 4 km2 in 1996 since 2000 the area of the island remained stable table 2 during the period of 1987 to 2014 there was a strong regularity to the morphological changes of wugui island the maximum length of the island increased while the average width of island was gradually reduced table 2 and fig 4a the length width ratio of the island greatly changed during 1995 during the period of 1980 1996 the average length width ratio was 3 49 this average value increased to 4 32 during 2000 2014 overall during the period of 1987 2014 the main branch switched from the left channel to the right channel and the island became narrower and longer with a significant increase in the length width ratio in addition during 1987 2014 there were no significant changes in the total width of the two anabranching channels which is derived from the width of the compound cross section and the average width of wugui island while there was significant change in the width of the compound cross section when the left branch functioned as the main branch the average width of the left branch was approximately 1645 m when the right branch functioned as the main branch the average width of right branch was approximately 1827 m the difference was approximately 200 m the right branch became wider than left branch after 1998 4 2 long term changes of flow sediment regime the linear regression results showed that during 1951 2009 the mean annual flow discharge was increasing fig 5 a while mean annual suspended sediment transport rate and mean annual sediment transport coefficient were initially increasing and then decreasing fig 5b c anyway the mann kendall test confirms that mean annual flow discharge had a significant increasing trend and mean annual suspended sediment transport rate and mean annual sediment transport coefficient had a totally decreasing trend table 4 although there was an increasing trend in flow discharge and a decreasing trend in sediment load during 1951 2009 the changing trend during sub period was quite different we determined the change points by using accumulated departure analyses and found that the change points for mean annual flow discharge mean annual suspended sediment transport rate and mean annual sediment transport coefficient were 1973 1991 and 1972 respectively fig 6 the change in flow sediment regimes results from a combination of river training engineering works such as artificial meander cutoffs during 1967 1972 gezhouba dam construction in 1981 and three gorges dam construction since 1999 from fig 5b and c we can find that the sediment transport rate began to decrease significantly since 1991 compared with that before the suspended sediment transport rate reduced to a minimum after 2003 when three gorges dam was put into full operation fig 7 the change point in sediment regime was basically coherent with the main channel switch during 1993 1996 fig 8 the adjustment of river channel and mid island morphology fig 4 obviously lagged behind the change in flow sediment regime fig 6 and transition between main channels fig 8 when the left branch functioned as the main channel until 1992 the percentage of flow sediment diversion in the left branch was varying during different flow discharge fig 9 a and b this may imply that the anabranching river system at this time was active and did not achieve equilibrium after the main channel was switched from left branch to right branch the percentage of flow sediment diversion in the right branch became relatively stable during different flow discharge with an average of 90 fig 9c and d both the anabranch channel width fig 4b and flow sediment diversion after main channel switch remain relative stable especially after the three gorges dam was put into operation the new relationship between flow and sediment after the three gorges dam provided a favorable condition for the new meandering anabranching river system into equilibrium by enhancing the river channel sediment transport efficiency this will be discussed in the following section 5 discussion 5 1 responses of channel planform to the flow sediment regime the switching of the main channel from one branch to another is the dominant characteristic of the channel planform dynamics of anabranching river systems and is the result of the flow dynamic axis movement in response to changes in the hydrological regime hu and hui 1995 the hydrometric measurements observed from 1951 to 2009 fig 4 showed that the mean annual flow discharge increased about 9 and suspended sediment concentration and sediment transport coefficient the ratio of suspended sediment concentration to flow discharge decreased about 75 and 76 respectively this means that the sediment transport coefficient the ratio of suspended sediment concentration to flow discharge had been becoming lower and the flow has increasing transport capacity which drove the flow dynamic axis moving towards the convex bank with a small curvature radius hu and hui 1995 the movement of the flow dynamic axis resulted in erosion of the right edge and island head of wugui island and deposition in the left edge of the island in consequence the island moved left the right channel expanded and the left channel shrunk during the period of 1994 1996 with the expansion of the right branch the right branch became wider that the left and the main channel shifted from the left branch to the right the right channel functioned as the main channel with the proportions of water and sediment discharge at more than 90 fig 9 in a meandering river the curvature radius of the flow dynamic axis was considered to be closely related to the flow discharge li 2008 zhang et al 1984 based on systematic analyses of 37 sets of cross sectional hydraulic measurements in the jingjiang reach the upper reach of the middle yangtze river during 1960s 1970s zhang et al 1984 proposed an exponential relationship between the radius of the main flow r and the ratio of flow discharge q and the channel slope s as follows 6 r q 2 s 1 3 when natural channel flow is able to reach an optimal state huang and nanson 2000 the relationship between channel slope flow discharge and sediment transport qs can be expressed as 7 s q s 0 526 q 0 678 by combining the eq 7 into eq 6 the relationship between the radius of the main flow and the ratio of flow discharge and sediment transport can be expressed as 8 r q 0 8927 q s 0 1753 eq 8 shows that the radius of the main flow axis will increase not only with an increase in flow discharge but also with a decrease in the sediment transport rate more importantly due to the flow discharge having an index of 0 8927 there is a stronger driving effect of the flow discharge than of the sediment transport rate with the index of 0 1753 the flow dynamic axis will swing following the cycle of the flow and sediment regimes in jianli reach the radius of curvature of the left branch was approximately 3500 m while the radius of curvature of the right branch was approximately 6800 m for a relative high sediment transport coefficient water flowed along the channel with a small curvature radius and by contrast water flowed along the channel with a large curvature radius therefore when the flow discharge increased and the sediment discharge remained the same or decreased since 1980s fig 10 the main flow dynamic axis of jianli reach gradually moved to the right channel with a larger radius of curvature for the meandering anabranching river system when flow discharge was relatively low and the sediment transport rate regime was high the radius would reduce and the flow and sediment transported along the left branch with a small curvature radius however when the configuration between flow and sediment regimes changed since 1992 fig 10 the radius of the main flow increased with the result that the main channel switch occurred and the right channel functioned as the main channel these phenomena show that the hydrological regime leads to the main channel switches in the jianli reach 5 2 channel planform adjustment to achieve sediment transport balance many previous studies demonstrate that the downstream river channel had complex response to upstream flow sediment regime regulation due to the impoundment of dams gregory and park 1974 petts 1979 williams and wolman 1984 chin et al 2002 hadley and emmett 1998 draut et al 2011 carley et al 2012 ma et al 2012 casado et al 2016 channel width could increase decrease or remain constant in the reach downstream from a dam petts 1979 williams and wolman 1984 and changing rate in streambed elevation and in channel width often became slowly with time williams and wolman 1984 this means that the channel morphology would adjust to accommodate the regulated flow sediment regime imposed by dam operation for the wide river channel on the low gradient floodplain riparian vegetation commonly increased in the reach downstream from the dams probably because of the decrease in peak flows friedman et al 1998 casado et al 2016 sanchis ibor et al 2019 the appearance of vegetation may lead to the formation of anabranching river from single channel river pattern to maintain an efficient conveyance of water and sediment the alluvial rivers respond to the changes in hydrological conditions by adjusting their hydraulic geometry and planform that is the variation in water and sediment conditions is the endogenous dynamic for the adjustment of channel evolution studies have shown that anabranching efficiency can be influenced by an adjustment in the width of the compound cross section huang and nanson 2007 when the width decreases the sediment transport efficiency will be significantly increased and when the width increases the sediment transport efficiency will likewise be reduced it was shown in table 5 that the relationship between the matching regimes of flow discharge and sediment load changed in 1995 from a high sediment and low water regime to high water and low sediment on the other hand during the period of 1987 2014 the width of the anabranching system did not change obvioulsy while the average width of the island was reduced approximately 200 m which led to an increase in the width of the compound cross section tables 2 and 4 to adapt to the adjustment in the changing regimes of increasing flow discharge and decreasing sediment loads in jianli reach the island tried to narrow its width and to increase the width of the compound cross section which would reduce the sediment transport efficiency and relieve the excess channel erosion therefore the adjustment in compound cross section width and island morphology may be affected by the change in flow and sediment regime 5 3 the influence of flow and sediment partition on the stability of anabranching river system from the field measurements we can find that in the main channel the percentage of sediment diversion is larger than the percentage of flow diversion fig 9 and table 6 before 1993 the left channel transported larger proportion of flow and sediment and served as the main channel table 6 and in the left channel the percentage of sediment diversion was larger than the percentage of flow diversion before 1992 since 1992 the percentage of sediment transported by left channel became lower that the percentage of flow this ultimately led to the shift of main channel from left channel to right channel in 1993 after 1993 the right channel transported more than 50 of flow and sediment and began to function as the main channel and transported more proportion of sediment load than proportion of flow however the river channel morphology showed a delayed response the mean river channel width of the right channel became larger than that of the left channel since 1996 fig 4 and table 2 the shift of main channel was closely related with the flow sediment partition rather than the channel morphology in general if the sub channel functions as the main channel it will transport more proportion of sediment than proportion of flow the relationship between flow sediment partition and channel island morphology for stable anabranching river system derived from theoretical analysis also shows that in the main channel the percentage of sediment diversion should be larger than the percentage of flow diversion liu et al 2016 if this relationship is not matched the anabranching river system will become unstable and the shift of main channel between the sub channel would happen 9 p s 1 1 p s 1 0 8143 p w 1 1 p w 1 0 8374 l 2 4 b 2 l where pw1 ps1 are the percentage of sediment diversion and percentage of flow diversion in the main channel 6 conclusion the remote sensing images of jianli reach during the period of 1987 2014 were successfully used to analyze the evolution of the meandering anabranching river planform the results showed that obvious changes occured in the channel width of the two branches from 1987 to 2014 the width of the left branch decreased from 1041 m to 340 m and the width of the right branch increased from 632 m to 1531 m the width of the compound cross section increased from 1673 m to 1871 m at the same time the morphology of wugui island underwent corresponding changes the maximum length increased and the average width decreased which led to an increase in the length width ratio of the island the main branch switched from the left channel to the right channel around 1995 the results from hydrological data analyses showed that due to the regulations of the gezhouba dam and the three gorges dam in the upstream the mean annual flow discharge increased about 9 and suspended sediment concentration and sediment transport coefficient the ratio of suspended sediment concentration to flow discharge decreased about 75 and 76 respectively from 1951 to 2009 the switches of the main channel from one to another may be caused by the increase in the flow discharge and decrease in sediment transport coefficient beginning in the 1980s which led to the flow dynamic axis moving right the adjustment was intensified by the changes in the matching regimes of flow discharge and sediment transport rate after 1995 to maintain an appropriate conveyance of water and sediment the anabranching planform responded to the change in the flow sediment regimes by narrowing the island width and increasing the width of the compound cross section the quantitative relationship between the planar morphology of meandering anabranching channel and the variation in hydrological

6084,river flow rates are important for water resources projects given this the current study explored the use of autoregressive ar and moving average ma techniques as individual time series models and compared them to the same models hybridized with an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch model to estimate monthly streamflow in addition two artificial intelligence ai approaches namely multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep were explored the performance of each of these models in estimating monthly streamflow was compared based on local and external data analyses using the local data analysis approach streamflow data at each target station was estimated using observed streamflow at the same station the external data analysis approach used neighboring station streamflow data to estimate streamflow data for the target station the beinerahe roodbar and pole astaneh stations on the sefidrood river iran as well as the port elgin and walkerton stations on the saugeen river canada were used as study areas upstream and downstream monthly streamflow time series data were used the performance of all models was compared using three error metrics including the root mean square error mean absolute error and correlation coefficient the results showed that the hybrid time series models i e ar arch and ma arch outperformed the conventional ar and ma models a comparison of all applied models revealed that the hybrid ar arch and ma arch time series models performed better than the ai techniques when using a local data analysis approach the external data analysis approach was more accurate for monthly streamflow estimation than the local data analysis approach to conclude based on the outcomes of the ai models under the external data analysis approach nearby data can be used to estimate streamflow of a target station when the target station streamflow data are not available keywords streamflow estimation time series models artificial intelligence approaches sefidrood river saugeen river 1 introduction recording river flow data is important in hydrological studies and water resources projects to help water engineers and managers with modeling processes and to support informed decision making fathian et al 2019a river flow data is especially important for the prevention and mitigation of flooding samsudin et al 2011 the planning of future water resources systems nigam et al 2014 the design of water infrastructure awchi 2014 the prediction of water inflow on a watershed scale rasouli et al 2012 the prediction of natural disasters including droughts and floods terzi and ergin 2014 the planning and implementation of multi objective optimal reservoir operations including water supply and irrigation and the generation of hydropower energy aggarwal et al 2012 more generally the estimation of river streamflow is important to facilitate more integrated collaborative and participatory planning and management of water resources therefore the development of new and useful models for the accurate estimation of streamflow is important for the sustainable management of water resources systems fathian et al 2019a streamflow like other hydrological processes e g rainfall involves dynamic non linear non stationary and highly complex behaviors maheswaran and khosa 2012 yaseen et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2019 to account for these complex behaviors appropriate tools must be applied when modeling streamflow time series in recent decades various techniques have been developed for modeling time series data in the water resources engineering among these techniques artificial intelligence ai and time series ts models are among the most used some common ai models include multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep some common ts models include linear ts models such as autoregressive ar and moving average ma and non linear ts models such as autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch both ai and ts models have been employed in various studies to model hydrological variables including streamflow ts models e g ar ma ar arch and ma arch are fitted to the local hydrological data of each target station while the ai techniques require a series of input data to estimate the target variable e g streamflow therefore local and external data analysis approaches are meaningful when working with ai techniques however a comparative assessment of these two modelling approaches under local and external data conditions has not yet been carried out this study seeks to address this gap in the literature the evaluation of the external performance of ai models is of great importance when streamflow data are unavailable for the target station in such a situation the streamflow data of a neighboring station can be used to predict the target station streamflow time series a brief overview of previous literature on streamflow modeling is provided kisi 2005 applied the ar and artificial neural network ann methods to predict the streamflow of two rivers located in the usa and turkey and found that the ann method outperformed the ar model wang et al 2009 evaluated the applicability of the genetic programming gp adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machine svm and autoregressive moving average arma models for monthly river flow discharge prediction the results indicated that gp anfis and svm outperformed the arma technique pramanik and panda 2009 employed the ann and anfis models to predict daily streamflow of the mahanadi river basin india and concluded that the anfis provided superior streamflow predictions compared to the ann ni et al 2010 used the gp method to forecast the annual streamflow of the west malian river in china and found that the gp model generated better results than the multiple linear regression mlr and multilayer perceptron mlp techniques furthermore in a study comparing models for estimating monthly streamflow in the kızılırmak river in turkey terzi and ergin 2014 demonstrated that the ar model outperformed other data based techniques such as gep anfis feed forward neural network ffnn and radial basis function network rbfn more recently hadi and tombul 2018 forecasted the daily streamflow of the seyhan river basin in turkey utilizing ai techniques which included ann anfis and svm as well as a simple ar time series model their results noted the better performance of ann and anfis compared to the svm and ar models with the ann producing the most accurate results along with the widespread application of individual ts and ai models the development of hybrid models has recently led to progress in improving the performance of standalone models in streamflow time series prediction guo et al 2011 introduced an adaptive insensitive factor to improve the accuracy of single svm for modeling the monthly streamflow time series of the yichang station in the changjiang river basin china the study reported that the improved svm increased streamflow prediction accuracy when compared to the standalone svm model adamowski et al 2012 compared the performance of mars and wavelet ann w ann techniques for runoff forecasting in the himalayas the results demonstrated that the w ann and mars models outperformed the unmodified ann technique highlighting the w ann and mars models as promising new methods for short term runoff modeling chen et al 2015 introduced hybrid models through the combination of optimization algorithms namely particle swarm optimization pso differential evolution de ant colony ac and artificial bee colony abc with the ann technique their results showed that the de and ac algorithms were able to improve the daily streamflow modeling of four river stations along the yellow river in altahama river usa furthermore yadav et al 2016 introduced a novel model called the online sequential extreme learning machine os elm for estimating the discharge time series of the neckar river in germany the performance of their model was evaluated by comparing its output with that of a variety of ai techniques including conventional ann svm and gp the results showed that the os elm model outperformed all other applied models yaseen et al 2018 coupled wavelet analysis with an extreme learning machine elm namely wa elm to model the monthly streamflow of the tigris river at the baghdad station it was reported that the hybrid wa elm outperformed the standalone elm danandeh mehr 2018 combined the gep and genetic algorithm ga for monthly streamflow forecasting of the shavir river in iran the proposed gep ga was found to be superior to the single gep fathian et al 2019b also showed that the use of hybrid threshold ar tar models with the generalized arch garch approach improved river flow modeling by removing the time varying variance effect in the residual time series of the tar models this literature review indicates that ai techniques have been applied more frequently than ts models to estimate streamflow previous studies on estimating streamflow time series have mainly focused on the assessment of the local performance of ai approaches while very few studies have examined their external performance however a few hybrid models are available in the literature which can be used to estimate streamflow via the hybridization of different ts models hence the current study aims to 1 investigate the performance of monthly streamflow modeling using the single ar and ma techniques as well as the hybrid ar arch and ma arch time series models 2 assess the capabilities of two ai based techniques namely the mars and gep models under both local and external analyses approaches and 3 compare the performance of ts and ai models to achieve these objectives two streamflow gauging stations in iran and two streamflow gauging stations in canada were selected as the study sites 2 study areas and data the present study uses monthly streamflow time series data from two hydrometric stations located on the saugeen river in canada and two other stations situated on the sefidrood river in iran the port elgin 44 27 23 n and 81 19 35 w and walkerton 44 07 13 n and 81 06 55 w hydrometric stations were used in the saugeen river and the beinerahe roodbar 36 47 60 n and 49 25 12 e and pole astaneh 37 16 48 n and 49 55 48 e stations were used for the sefidrood river the saugeen river is located in southern ontario in canada it flows from north to west in this region and is approximately 160 km long the sefidrood river is the second longest river and the largest northern river in iran that discharges into the caspian sea from a geographical point of view the sefidrood river watershed with an approximate area of 59 429 km2 belongs to a larger watershed the caspian basin which consists of mountains 75 while the rest includes plains and foothills due to the size and topography of the basin all climates can be found there from desert to very humid based on the de martonne climatic zones the location of the hydrometric stations are shown in fig 1 these four hydrometric stations in two different countries i e iran and canada which have different flow conditions were selected to generalize the outcomes of this study to different regions that being said these two pairs of stations were also chosen because they are located close to each other in their respective rivers and therefore have similar flow conditions which allows for the validation of the performance of ai models under external conditions data for the sefidrood river in iran and the saugeen river in canada were obtained from the water resources management company of iran http wrs wrm ir amar and the water office of the government of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca respectively the study data were collected from october 1956 to september 2015 708 months for the iranian stations and between october 1917 and september 2017 1200 months for the canadian stations these data were split into training and testing datasets specifically for the iranian stations the data from october 1956 to september 2000 i e 75 of the total data or 528 months were used as the training dataset while the remaining data 25 of the total data or 180 months between october 2000 and september 2015 were used as the testing dataset for the canadian dataset the data from october 1917 to september 1992 i e 75 total data or 900 months were used as the training dataset and the remaining data i e 25 of total data or 300 months between the period of october 1992 and september 2017 were used as the testing dataset fig 2 illustrates the time series plots of the monthly streamflow for the four stations during the study periods table 1 presents the monthly statistical parameters of streamflow time series for each dataset at the studied stations 3 methods 3 1 normalizing and standardizing the data before implementing the models the data must be preprocessed to this end the following equations were used to normalize and standardize the entire streamflow dataset mehdizadeh et al 2017b respectively 1 q n ln q o c 2 q s q n q n σ q n where qo represents the observed streamflow qn and qs denote the normalized and standardized streamflow respectively and q n and σ q n represent the mean and standard deviation σ of the data the c parameter in eq 1 is a constant that must be obtained by means of trial and error in this context a small minimum value for the skewness coefficient of the streamflow data is most desirable because datasets with a normal distribution tend to have the smallest value of any distribution in terms of the skewness coefficient i e zero or close to zero for an ideal case therefore when normalizing the streamflow datasets the constant c was added or subtracted from the streamflow values the optimal c constants at the studied sites were chosen based on the least skewness coefficients see section 4 1 the standardization process was carried out separately for each month for example the mean and standard deviation of the streamflow data for october were inputted into eq 2 to standardize the monthly streamflow data for october this same method was applied to standardize the streamflow for the remaining months 3 2 ts based models in order to build a ts model the following steps should be considered 1 normalization and standardization of the original time series according to the descriptions given in section 3 1 2 identification and determination of model order by investigating the acf and pacf structures of the intended time series and selecting the minimum akaike information criterion aic 3 model estimation to determine the parameters of the fitted models based on the minimum conditional sum of squares as one of the fitting methods 4 model diagnostic to select the best fitted model for the given time series by checking the adequacy of the model by inspecting the acf of the residuals of the best fitted model or other inspection tests the following sections describe the development of the ar ma and hybrid ts models for the current study 3 2 1 ar and ma models the use of time series models in hydrology originated in the 1960s and since their introduction various time series models have been developed for the modeling and prediction of time series data including models by thomas and fiering 1962 yevjevich 1963 and box and jenkins 1976 the autoregressive integrated moving average arima is one such model from this model derivations such as ar ma and arma were developed in the present study ar and ma models were applied to predict monthly streamflow data ar and ma models are based on the markov chain a stochastic model indicating a sequence of probabilistic events such that the probability of each event depends only on the previous event s mode the structures of ar p and ma q models used in this study are given as follows hipel and mcleod 1996 3 z t i 1 p ϕ i z t i ε t 4 z t j 1 q θ j ε t j ε t where z t is the normalized and standardized time series ϕ i and θ j are the parameters of the ar and ma models p and q are the orders of the fitted ar and ma models and ε t and ε t are the independent identically distributed normal errors of ar and ma with a zero mean and standard deviation respectively 3 2 2 arch model to capture the heteroscedasticity time varying variance in the residual times series of the ar and ma models the arch model introduced by engle 1982 was used to model the non linear behavior of the second order moment of the hydrological variables to this end two hybrid models are developed ar arch and ma arch the arch model with order v arch v is defined as modarres and ouarda 2013a b 5 σ t 2 α 0 i 1 v α i ε t i 2 v 0 α 0 0 α i 0 ε t σ t e t f o r a r a r c h 6 σ t 2 α 0 i 1 v α i ε t i 2 v 0 α 0 0 α i 0 ε t σ t e t f o r m a a r c h where σ t 2 denotes the conditional variance α i and v are the parameters and order of the arch model and e t and e t denote the standardized data with a mean of 0 and of variance 1 of the errors obtained by the hybrid ar arch and ma arch models respectively 3 3 ai based models 3 3 1 gep model the gep model based on darwinian evolution theory was first proposed by ferreira 2001 this technique combines the genetic algorithm ga and gp methods in order to build time series data for modeling while the ga method works on a series of binary digits the gep model utilizes expression trees i e parse trees these consist of function sets that include mathematical operators and functions and terminal sets that include problem variables and constants different time series processes are modeled by these respective sets the general outline of a gep model is as follows mehdizadeh et al 2017a 1 generation of an initial population of chromosomes producing chromosomes from the initial population is done randomly according to existing information regarding the intended process 2 expression of the chromosomes as the expression tree 3 evaluation of the efficiency or fitness of each chromosome 4 selection of the best chromosomes to modify and reproduce to form new chromosomes the modifications and reproductions are carried out via several genetic operators namely mutation inversion recombination and transposition in order to solve a problem using gep five main steps should be followed first a fitness function is selected in the current study the root mean square error rmse was selected as the fitness function second both sets of functions i e ln x e x x x 3 x 2 x 3 sinx c o s x a r c t a n x and the terminals i e the gep model inputs and outputs are selected third the architecture of the chromosomes is determined fourth the connecting or linking function is defined the current study uses an addition function finally the rates of the genetic operators are selected for the present study the parameters used in the gep model are noted in table 2 3 3 2 mars model the mars model is a non parametric technique first introduced by friedman 1991 given its non parametric nature the structure of the mars model is unknown before the modeling process in this model the time series data are divided into several subsets and then the appropriate basis functions are fitted to the data as such the problem space in mars is divided into several intervals of input variables and individual splines are then fitted to each interval friedman 1991 each spline i e basis function is specified at a certain interval and the endpoints of an interval are called knots the basis function is applied to illustrate data for each spline which is specified for each two knots sephton 2001 these basis functions representing the functional relationship between the input and output variables can be written as follows mehdizadeh 2018a 7 y max 0 c x 8 y max 0 x c where y and x denote the output and input respectively and c denotes a threshold value named the knot the mars model procedure is implemented in a two step procedure in the first or forward step the modeling process is initiated by choosing a fixed term which is the average of target values next the basis functions are added to the fixed term continuously until the sum of square errors is significantly reduced the initial model tends to be over fitted therefore in the next step called the backward step over fitting is minimized through the elimination of less effective basis functions to this end a generalized cross validation criterion is applied to the model to determine the least effective basis functions the mars model generates a relationship in the form of eq 9 as follows mehdizadeh 2018a 9 y f x a 0 m 1 m a m b m x where a 0 a m b m x and m are a constant term the coefficients of the m th basis function the m th basis function and the number of nonzero terms in the model respectively 3 4 implementation of models 3 4 1 single and hybrid ts based models the single ar and ma time series models were fitted to the normalized and standardized streamflow datasets all time series models e g ar ma and arch can model the target variable using eqs 3 6 additionally the following procedures were used to develop the hybrid time series based models namely the ar arch and ma arch models fathian et al 2019b 1 the residual time series of the optimum ar i e ε t and ma i e ε t models fitted to the normalized and standardized data were calculated specifically the residuals of ar and ma models were used to construct the hybrid ar arch and ma arch models to improve monthly streamflow estimation 2 the obtained ε t 2 and ε t 2 values were input into the arch model this produces an arch model fit to the square errors of ar and ma i e ε t 2 and ε t 2 3 next the first order arch model i e arch 1 was applied to model the output data as follows 10 σ t 2 α 0 α 1 ε t 1 2 ε t σ t e t f o r a r a r c h 11 σ t 2 α 0 α 1 ε t 1 2 ε t σ t e t f o r m a a r c h all variables and parameters in the above mentioned equations have been defined in section 3 2 2 it is important that the modeled streamflow time series be both de standardized and de normalized to obtain estimated streamflow data in its true form with the units being cubic meter per second m3 s 3 4 2 ai based models in the current study the performances of the ai models namely mars and gep were evaluated under two different strategies 3 4 2 1 strategy 1 local analysis approach under the local analysis strategy the streamflow for each target station is predicted using the original data of that station 3 4 2 2 strategy 2 external analysis approach under the external analysis approach the data of a neighboring station is used to estimate streamflow at each target station table 3 sums up the various input combinations applied to develop the ai models for both the local and external data analyses approaches for example in the mars1 and gep1 local analysis models the streamflow of the current month was estimated using data from the previous month i e a one month lag q t 1 conversely for the mars1 and gep1 models under the external analysis approach the streamflow data of the same month q t at a nearby station were used for streamflow modeling of each target station 3 5 performance statistics for model evaluation the present study evaluates the performance of the fitted models i e the single ar and ma the hybrid ar arch and ma arch time series models and the mars and gep models under both local and external analyses approaches in terms of their ability to accurately estimate monthly streamflow by applying three statistical indicators namely the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r the calculations for these indicators can be found in eqs 12 14 as below mehdizadeh et al 2019 12 rmse i 1 n q ob i q es i 2 n 13 mae i 1 n q ob i q es i n 14 r i 1 n q ob i q ob q es i q es i 1 n q ob i q ob 2 i 1 n q es i q es 2 where q ob i q es i q ob q es and n denote the i th observed monthly streamflow the i th estimated monthly streamflow the average of the observed monthly streamflow the average of the estimated monthly streamflow and the number of total observations which are separately considered for the training and testing datasets respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of data normalization and standardization as noted the normalization and standardization of the time series data are necessary for the application of the modeling procedures the following equations were used to normalize the monthly streamflow datasets of the studied stations q n ln q o 22 01 for beinerahe roodbar station q n ln q o 9 28 for pole astaneh station q n ln q o 5 08 for port elgin station q n ln q o 2 433 for walkerton station skewness coefficients were computed for the observed monthly streamflow datasets of each station as 2 36 2 48 1 79 and 1 88 for the beinerahe roodbar pole astaneh port elgin and walkerton stations respectively however the skewness coefficients for the normalized datasets were calculated as 2 05e 06 7 55e 05 5 46e 05 and 5 69e 05 respectively these comparatively trivial values confirm the suitable normalization of the streamflow datasets furthermore the values of the mean and standard deviation for the standardized datasets were found to be 0 and 0 99 respectively this supports the argument that the data have been properly standardized 4 2 results of the single ts based models after developing and running the ar and ma time series models the best fitted models were chosen based on their aic values with the models achieving the lowest aic values labeled most suitable the equations of the optimal ar and ma models are presented in table 4 and the corresponding performance statistics for both training and testing phases are presented in table 5 for the iranian stations the ma 9 model in the training phase and the ar 11 model in the testing phase at the beinerahe roodbar station as well as the ar 1 model in both the training and testing phases at the pole astaneh station demonstrate the most satisfactory statistics compared to the alternate model at each station negligible differences exist between the performance of the single ar and ma models for the port elgin station in both the training and testing phases although the ma 4 model shows a slightly better performance than the ar 1 in the training phase and slightly poorer results than the ar 1 model in the testing phase for the walkerton station the performance of the ma 4 model in the training phase is slightly better than the ar 1 model however during the testing phase the results show that the ar 1 model outperforms the ma 4 model at this station 4 3 results of the hybrid ts based models as previously discussed the ar and ma models were hybridized with the arch model to improve their streamflow estimation accuracy to this end the square errors of ar and ma models i e ε t 2 and ε t 2 were used to fit the arch model to the data the arch model captures the streamflow data residuals obtained from the ar and ma models to reduce the variation and uncertainty of model estimation in the residual time series the relationships generated by fitting the optimal arch model to the streamflow datasets are listed in table 4 while the performance indices of the hybrid time series models i e ar arch and ma arch are shown in table 5 in general the hybrid models outperform the corresponding uncoupled models for example the performance statistics of the ma 6 model at the pole astaneh station during the test phase are rmse 65 08 m3 s mae 35 91 m3 s and r 0 693 these same statistics improve to rmse 22 84 m3 s mae 10 88 m3 s and r 0 961 for the corresponding hybrid model i e ma 6 arch 1 the rmse values of the best performing hybrid models with bolded statistics in table 5 i e ma 9 arch 1 at beinerahe roodbar ma 6 arch 1 at pole astaneh ma 4 arch 1 at port elgin and ar 1 arch 1 at walkerton and are respectively 69 81 64 90 58 44 and 55 85 lower than the corresponding values for the single time series models the absence or presence of over fitting problems during the modeling procedure help recognize whether modeling techniques such as the ts models are appropriate for a given situation fathian et al 2019c the over fitted models usually present reasonable or excellent results during the training phase but perform poorly during the testing phase comparing the performance of the single and hybrid models for the training and testing stages demonstrates that the single and hybrid models have acceptable accuracies therefore indicating the absence of over fitting in the developed models this trend that suggests the superiority of hybrid models is not observed for all hydroclimatic datasets and all different climatic regions for example the results for the beinerahe roodbar station show that in the training phase the rmse value for both hybrid models is higher than for the original models however the mae values are lower and the r values are higher for the hybrid models in the testing phase the ma 9 arch 1 model outperformed all others for the beinerahe roodbar station analysis suggests that the hybrid models may over or under estimate the peak values at several points leading to higher rmse values for the hybrid models compared to the unmodified models this discrepancy supports the modarres and ouarda 2013a and romilly 2005 studies that reported on the challenges of hybridizing with arch models using different evaluation criteria for rainfall and temperature time series respectively the authors reported that in their case study despite the use of generalized arch i e garch model as a typical type of arch the capturing of the heteroscedasticity of the residuals of a linear ts model potentially increased the performance of the hybrid time series therefore there is no guarantee of better results from using a garch model the arch can often but not always capture the autocorrelation behavior of the residual time series which reduces the uncertainty in estimating the values of target data however as modarres and ouarda 2013a and romilly 2005 reported this property may not be observed for all hydrological and meteorological data comparing the performance of the hybrid models reveals that for the beinerahe roodbar station the ma 9 arch 1 model performs best in both training and testing phases for the pole astaneh and port elgin stations the ar 1 arch 1 performs best in the training phase while the ma 6 arch 1 for pole astaneh and the ma 4 arch 1 for port elgin perform best during the testing phase for the walkerton station the ma 4 arch 1 is superior in the training phase and the ar 1 arch 1 performs best during the testing phase see table 5 there are negligible differences between the performances of the hybrid ar arch and ma arch models for the two canadian stations in both training and testing phases for the two iranian stations however based on all the performance measures used in this study there is a significant difference between the performances of the hybrid models in both phases to further analyze the performance of the hybrid models compared to the unmodified models the best performing hybrid model statistical analysis results shown in bold in table 5 and the corresponding single model were selected during the test phase then comparative scatter plots were developed as shown in fig 3 in this figure the dotted red lines denote the line of equality i e 1 1 and the blue lines represent the regression lines fitted to the observed and estimated streamflow data it is clear that fewer scatters dispersions are present in the hybrid models around the 1 1 line indicating a better performance on the part of the hybrid models compared to the single models this trend has been reported in the literature when using hybrid time series models as well as for the integration of ai techniques with wavelet analysis and time series models fathian et al 2019b c mehdizadeh et al 2017b 2018 2019 mehdizadeh 2018b mehdizadeh and kozekalani sales 2018 kisi and cimen 2011 modarres and ouarda 2013b ravansalar et al 2017 4 4 results of the ai based models using the local analysis approach as noted the present study evaluated the accuracy of the given ai models under both local and external analyses approaches tables 6 9 summarize the error statistics computed for the beinerahe roodbar pole astaneh port elgin and walkerton stations respectively the performance indicators of the models under the local analysis approach suggest that the mars and gep techniques have the ability to estimate the target month s streamflow using streamflow data from previous months slight differences exist between the estimation precision of the mars and gep models at the studied stations with the mars model outperforming the gep model 4 5 results of the ai based models using the external analysis approach using the external analysis approach the model performance can be assessed when there is a good correlation between the streamflow time series of neighboring stations located on a specific river fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the streamflow data for the two iranian stations and the two canadian stations correlation coefficients of 0 810 and 0 986 were obtained for the iranian and canadian stations respectively this relatively high data correlation supports the use of the external analysis approach in which streamflow time series data from a nearby station is utilized to estimate the streamflow values of each target station for example the streamflow data of port elgin as a nearby station was used to estimate the streamflow time series of walkerton as a target station and vice versa this trend was also seen for iran s stations located on sefidrood river the accuracy of the ai models under the external analysis approach was significantly higher than under the local analysis approach especially for the canadian stations port elgin and walkerton as an example the rmse mae and r error statistics for the best ai models during the test phase under external data analysis are respectively 6 36 m3 s 4 38 m3 s and 0 993 for gep4 at port elgin and 3 19 m3 s 2 18 m3 s and 0 993 for mars1 at walkerton the corresponding values for the models under local data analysis were 38 68 m3 s 24 67 m3 s and 0 705 at port elgin and 19 51 m3 s 12 49 m3 s and 0 703 at walkerton the rates of reduction in the rmse values for the best models under an external condition i e mars4 at beinerahe roodbar gep3 at pole astaneh gep4 at port elgin and mars1 at walkerton compared to the corresponding models using local evaluation are 25 48 31 71 83 56 83 65 respectively assessing the performance of ai based models under both local and external conditions demonstrates that over fitting did not occur for the models developed in this study these models performed similarly accurately for both training and testing stages similar results were observed for the single and hybrid ts based models the performance of the ai models under the external analysis approach and the corresponding models under the local analysis approach are graphically compared in fig 5 the performance statistics of the superior models for the studied stations in the testing phase have been highlighted in bold font in tables 6 9 the analysis shows that the monthly streamflow data estimated by the superior models under the external analysis approach are more optimally fitted to the dotted line representing equality 1 1 compared to the estimates of the same models under the local analysis approach 4 6 comparison of the ts and ai based models upon evaluating the performance of the single ts and ai models under the local analysis approach it is apparent that the mars and gep models are in general more accurate than the single ar and ma models for modeling streamflow at the beinerahe roodbar and pole astaneh stations during the training phase using data from the port elgin and walkerton stations the single ts and ai models under local analysis show similar results in general under local analysis the ar and ma models outperform the mars and gep models at the port elgin and walkerton stations during the testing phase notably the best fitted ar arch and ma arch hybrid models generally perform much better than the ai models under the local analysis approach for all four stations in both the training and testing phases with the exception of the training phase of the hybrid ts models and the testing phase of the ar arch model at the beinerahe roodbar station comparing the performance of the ts and ai models under the external analysis approach for the two iranian stations demonstrates the better accuracy of ai models over the single i e ar and ma and hybrid i e ar arch and ma arch models except during the testing phase of the ma arch model at the beinerahe roodbar station and during the testing phase of both the ar arch and ma arch models at the pole astaneh station in addition the mars and gep models under the external analysis approach outperformed the single and hybrid ts models for the canadian stations of port elgin and walkerton the performance of ts models is better than that of ai models in some cases and vice versa the ai models outperform the ts models for other cases mehdizadeh et al 2018 2019 and fathian et al 2019c reported that hydrological time series such as streamflow consist of two terms namely the stochastic and deterministic such that the ts and ai models can capture and model the stochastic and deterministic terms of the streamflow data respectively a superior performance from the ts based model compared to the ai based model means that it can better model the stochastic term than capturing the deterministic term via the ai based model conversely an ai model is more accurate than a ts model when the ai model can capture the deterministic term with a higher level of precision than estimating the stochastic term through the ts model 5 conclusions the current research aimed to compare the performance of monthly streamflow estimation based on time series and artificial intelligence models at two hydrometric stations on the sefidrood river in iran as well as two stations on the saugeen river in canada to achieve this two single models ar and ma two hybrid ts based models ar arch and ma arch and two ai based models mars and gep were applied to the data from the stations and their performances evaluated the ai models were analyzed under both local and external analysis approaches results indicated that the single ma and ar models for the beinerahe roodbar station during the training and testing phases as well as the single ar model for the pole astaneh station in both phases had superior accuracy compared to other single ts models there was minimal difference between the performance of the single ar and ma models at the stations in canada specifically the ma and ar models in the training and testing phases respectively had slightly better performances than the other single ts models developed regarding the hybrid ts models the results demonstrated that generally the developed hybrid ar arch and ma arch models provided much better streamflow estimates than the single ar and ma models at the studied stations a comparison of the performance of the ai models showed a higher precision of the models under the external analysis approach compared to the same model scenario under local analysis these results suggest that the selection of the neighboring stations for modeling the streamflow time series of each target station was appropriate in general the ai models under both local and external analysis approaches showed superior performances compared with the single and hybrid ts models for the iranian stations additionally the ai models under external analysis performed better than the single and hybrid ts models for the canadian stations the ai models under the external analysis approach during the training phase and the hybrid ts models i e ma arch during the test phase for iran s stations and the ai models under external analysis for the canadian stations were the best performing models the most accurate estimates of monthly streamflow during the test phase were achieved by the hybrid ma 9 arch 1 at beinerahe roodbar rmse 17 55 m3 s mae 10 27 m3 s r 0 982 the hybrid ma 6 arch 1 at pole astaneh rmse 22 84 m3 s mae 10 88 m3 s r 0 961 the gep4 under an external condition at port elgin rmse 6 36 m3 s mae 4 38 m3 s r 0 993 and the mars1 under an external condition at walkerton rmse 3 19 m3 s mae 2 18 m3 s r 0 993 as mentioned the non linear arch captured the conditional variance of streamflow time series while this is not considered in the linear ar and ma models this feature is an advantage of hybrid ar arch and ma arch models over the single ar and ma on the other hand as concluded for the beinerahe roodbar station utilizing the hybrid ts based models does not necessarily lead to better results compared to single models furthermore evaluating the performance of ai based models under both local and external conditions revealed that an external assessment is worthwhile when local streamflow data are not available for the ai models since they often obtain higher precision than the local evaluation the results obtained in the current study suggest that the hybrid ts models offer superior performance compared to the single models for streamflow analysis it is suggested that further efforts be directed at developing other types of hybrid models for the forecasting of streamflow and other hydrological variables including the exploration of alternate ts and ai modeling approaches such as arma arima garch ann anfis svm etc declaration of competing interest the

6084,river flow rates are important for water resources projects given this the current study explored the use of autoregressive ar and moving average ma techniques as individual time series models and compared them to the same models hybridized with an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch model to estimate monthly streamflow in addition two artificial intelligence ai approaches namely multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep were explored the performance of each of these models in estimating monthly streamflow was compared based on local and external data analyses using the local data analysis approach streamflow data at each target station was estimated using observed streamflow at the same station the external data analysis approach used neighboring station streamflow data to estimate streamflow data for the target station the beinerahe roodbar and pole astaneh stations on the sefidrood river iran as well as the port elgin and walkerton stations on the saugeen river canada were used as study areas upstream and downstream monthly streamflow time series data were used the performance of all models was compared using three error metrics including the root mean square error mean absolute error and correlation coefficient the results showed that the hybrid time series models i e ar arch and ma arch outperformed the conventional ar and ma models a comparison of all applied models revealed that the hybrid ar arch and ma arch time series models performed better than the ai techniques when using a local data analysis approach the external data analysis approach was more accurate for monthly streamflow estimation than the local data analysis approach to conclude based on the outcomes of the ai models under the external data analysis approach nearby data can be used to estimate streamflow of a target station when the target station streamflow data are not available keywords streamflow estimation time series models artificial intelligence approaches sefidrood river saugeen river 1 introduction recording river flow data is important in hydrological studies and water resources projects to help water engineers and managers with modeling processes and to support informed decision making fathian et al 2019a river flow data is especially important for the prevention and mitigation of flooding samsudin et al 2011 the planning of future water resources systems nigam et al 2014 the design of water infrastructure awchi 2014 the prediction of water inflow on a watershed scale rasouli et al 2012 the prediction of natural disasters including droughts and floods terzi and ergin 2014 the planning and implementation of multi objective optimal reservoir operations including water supply and irrigation and the generation of hydropower energy aggarwal et al 2012 more generally the estimation of river streamflow is important to facilitate more integrated collaborative and participatory planning and management of water resources therefore the development of new and useful models for the accurate estimation of streamflow is important for the sustainable management of water resources systems fathian et al 2019a streamflow like other hydrological processes e g rainfall involves dynamic non linear non stationary and highly complex behaviors maheswaran and khosa 2012 yaseen et al 2015 mehdizadeh et al 2019 to account for these complex behaviors appropriate tools must be applied when modeling streamflow time series in recent decades various techniques have been developed for modeling time series data in the water resources engineering among these techniques artificial intelligence ai and time series ts models are among the most used some common ai models include multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and gene expression programming gep some common ts models include linear ts models such as autoregressive ar and moving average ma and non linear ts models such as autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch both ai and ts models have been employed in various studies to model hydrological variables including streamflow ts models e g ar ma ar arch and ma arch are fitted to the local hydrological data of each target station while the ai techniques require a series of input data to estimate the target variable e g streamflow therefore local and external data analysis approaches are meaningful when working with ai techniques however a comparative assessment of these two modelling approaches under local and external data conditions has not yet been carried out this study seeks to address this gap in the literature the evaluation of the external performance of ai models is of great importance when streamflow data are unavailable for the target station in such a situation the streamflow data of a neighboring station can be used to predict the target station streamflow time series a brief overview of previous literature on streamflow modeling is provided kisi 2005 applied the ar and artificial neural network ann methods to predict the streamflow of two rivers located in the usa and turkey and found that the ann method outperformed the ar model wang et al 2009 evaluated the applicability of the genetic programming gp adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machine svm and autoregressive moving average arma models for monthly river flow discharge prediction the results indicated that gp anfis and svm outperformed the arma technique pramanik and panda 2009 employed the ann and anfis models to predict daily streamflow of the mahanadi river basin india and concluded that the anfis provided superior streamflow predictions compared to the ann ni et al 2010 used the gp method to forecast the annual streamflow of the west malian river in china and found that the gp model generated better results than the multiple linear regression mlr and multilayer perceptron mlp techniques furthermore in a study comparing models for estimating monthly streamflow in the kızılırmak river in turkey terzi and ergin 2014 demonstrated that the ar model outperformed other data based techniques such as gep anfis feed forward neural network ffnn and radial basis function network rbfn more recently hadi and tombul 2018 forecasted the daily streamflow of the seyhan river basin in turkey utilizing ai techniques which included ann anfis and svm as well as a simple ar time series model their results noted the better performance of ann and anfis compared to the svm and ar models with the ann producing the most accurate results along with the widespread application of individual ts and ai models the development of hybrid models has recently led to progress in improving the performance of standalone models in streamflow time series prediction guo et al 2011 introduced an adaptive insensitive factor to improve the accuracy of single svm for modeling the monthly streamflow time series of the yichang station in the changjiang river basin china the study reported that the improved svm increased streamflow prediction accuracy when compared to the standalone svm model adamowski et al 2012 compared the performance of mars and wavelet ann w ann techniques for runoff forecasting in the himalayas the results demonstrated that the w ann and mars models outperformed the unmodified ann technique highlighting the w ann and mars models as promising new methods for short term runoff modeling chen et al 2015 introduced hybrid models through the combination of optimization algorithms namely particle swarm optimization pso differential evolution de ant colony ac and artificial bee colony abc with the ann technique their results showed that the de and ac algorithms were able to improve the daily streamflow modeling of four river stations along the yellow river in altahama river usa furthermore yadav et al 2016 introduced a novel model called the online sequential extreme learning machine os elm for estimating the discharge time series of the neckar river in germany the performance of their model was evaluated by comparing its output with that of a variety of ai techniques including conventional ann svm and gp the results showed that the os elm model outperformed all other applied models yaseen et al 2018 coupled wavelet analysis with an extreme learning machine elm namely wa elm to model the monthly streamflow of the tigris river at the baghdad station it was reported that the hybrid wa elm outperformed the standalone elm danandeh mehr 2018 combined the gep and genetic algorithm ga for monthly streamflow forecasting of the shavir river in iran the proposed gep ga was found to be superior to the single gep fathian et al 2019b also showed that the use of hybrid threshold ar tar models with the generalized arch garch approach improved river flow modeling by removing the time varying variance effect in the residual time series of the tar models this literature review indicates that ai techniques have been applied more frequently than ts models to estimate streamflow previous studies on estimating streamflow time series have mainly focused on the assessment of the local performance of ai approaches while very few studies have examined their external performance however a few hybrid models are available in the literature which can be used to estimate streamflow via the hybridization of different ts models hence the current study aims to 1 investigate the performance of monthly streamflow modeling using the single ar and ma techniques as well as the hybrid ar arch and ma arch time series models 2 assess the capabilities of two ai based techniques namely the mars and gep models under both local and external analyses approaches and 3 compare the performance of ts and ai models to achieve these objectives two streamflow gauging stations in iran and two streamflow gauging stations in canada were selected as the study sites 2 study areas and data the present study uses monthly streamflow time series data from two hydrometric stations located on the saugeen river in canada and two other stations situated on the sefidrood river in iran the port elgin 44 27 23 n and 81 19 35 w and walkerton 44 07 13 n and 81 06 55 w hydrometric stations were used in the saugeen river and the beinerahe roodbar 36 47 60 n and 49 25 12 e and pole astaneh 37 16 48 n and 49 55 48 e stations were used for the sefidrood river the saugeen river is located in southern ontario in canada it flows from north to west in this region and is approximately 160 km long the sefidrood river is the second longest river and the largest northern river in iran that discharges into the caspian sea from a geographical point of view the sefidrood river watershed with an approximate area of 59 429 km2 belongs to a larger watershed the caspian basin which consists of mountains 75 while the rest includes plains and foothills due to the size and topography of the basin all climates can be found there from desert to very humid based on the de martonne climatic zones the location of the hydrometric stations are shown in fig 1 these four hydrometric stations in two different countries i e iran and canada which have different flow conditions were selected to generalize the outcomes of this study to different regions that being said these two pairs of stations were also chosen because they are located close to each other in their respective rivers and therefore have similar flow conditions which allows for the validation of the performance of ai models under external conditions data for the sefidrood river in iran and the saugeen river in canada were obtained from the water resources management company of iran http wrs wrm ir amar and the water office of the government of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca respectively the study data were collected from october 1956 to september 2015 708 months for the iranian stations and between october 1917 and september 2017 1200 months for the canadian stations these data were split into training and testing datasets specifically for the iranian stations the data from october 1956 to september 2000 i e 75 of the total data or 528 months were used as the training dataset while the remaining data 25 of the total data or 180 months between october 2000 and september 2015 were used as the testing dataset for the canadian dataset the data from october 1917 to september 1992 i e 75 total data or 900 months were used as the training dataset and the remaining data i e 25 of total data or 300 months between the period of october 1992 and september 2017 were used as the testing dataset fig 2 illustrates the time series plots of the monthly streamflow for the four stations during the study periods table 1 presents the monthly statistical parameters of streamflow time series for each dataset at the studied stations 3 methods 3 1 normalizing and standardizing the data before implementing the models the data must be preprocessed to this end the following equations were used to normalize and standardize the entire streamflow dataset mehdizadeh et al 2017b respectively 1 q n ln q o c 2 q s q n q n σ q n where qo represents the observed streamflow qn and qs denote the normalized and standardized streamflow respectively and q n and σ q n represent the mean and standard deviation σ of the data the c parameter in eq 1 is a constant that must be obtained by means of trial and error in this context a small minimum value for the skewness coefficient of the streamflow data is most desirable because datasets with a normal distribution tend to have the smallest value of any distribution in terms of the skewness coefficient i e zero or close to zero for an ideal case therefore when normalizing the streamflow datasets the constant c was added or subtracted from the streamflow values the optimal c constants at the studied sites were chosen based on the least skewness coefficients see section 4 1 the standardization process was carried out separately for each month for example the mean and standard deviation of the streamflow data for october were inputted into eq 2 to standardize the monthly streamflow data for october this same method was applied to standardize the streamflow for the remaining months 3 2 ts based models in order to build a ts model the following steps should be considered 1 normalization and standardization of the original time series according to the descriptions given in section 3 1 2 identification and determination of model order by investigating the acf and pacf structures of the intended time series and selecting the minimum akaike information criterion aic 3 model estimation to determine the parameters of the fitted models based on the minimum conditional sum of squares as one of the fitting methods 4 model diagnostic to select the best fitted model for the given time series by checking the adequacy of the model by inspecting the acf of the residuals of the best fitted model or other inspection tests the following sections describe the development of the ar ma and hybrid ts models for the current study 3 2 1 ar and ma models the use of time series models in hydrology originated in the 1960s and since their introduction various time series models have been developed for the modeling and prediction of time series data including models by thomas and fiering 1962 yevjevich 1963 and box and jenkins 1976 the autoregressive integrated moving average arima is one such model from this model derivations such as ar ma and arma were developed in the present study ar and ma models were applied to predict monthly streamflow data ar and ma models are based on the markov chain a stochastic model indicating a sequence of probabilistic events such that the probability of each event depends only on the previous event s mode the structures of ar p and ma q models used in this study are given as follows hipel and mcleod 1996 3 z t i 1 p ϕ i z t i ε t 4 z t j 1 q θ j ε t j ε t where z t is the normalized and standardized time series ϕ i and θ j are the parameters of the ar and ma models p and q are the orders of the fitted ar and ma models and ε t and ε t are the independent identically distributed normal errors of ar and ma with a zero mean and standard deviation respectively 3 2 2 arch model to capture the heteroscedasticity time varying variance in the residual times series of the ar and ma models the arch model introduced by engle 1982 was used to model the non linear behavior of the second order moment of the hydrological variables to this end two hybrid models are developed ar arch and ma arch the arch model with order v arch v is defined as modarres and ouarda 2013a b 5 σ t 2 α 0 i 1 v α i ε t i 2 v 0 α 0 0 α i 0 ε t σ t e t f o r a r a r c h 6 σ t 2 α 0 i 1 v α i ε t i 2 v 0 α 0 0 α i 0 ε t σ t e t f o r m a a r c h where σ t 2 denotes the conditional variance α i and v are the parameters and order of the arch model and e t and e t denote the standardized data with a mean of 0 and of variance 1 of the errors obtained by the hybrid ar arch and ma arch models respectively 3 3 ai based models 3 3 1 gep model the gep model based on darwinian evolution theory was first proposed by ferreira 2001 this technique combines the genetic algorithm ga and gp methods in order to build time series data for modeling while the ga method works on a series of binary digits the gep model utilizes expression trees i e parse trees these consist of function sets that include mathematical operators and functions and terminal sets that include problem variables and constants different time series processes are modeled by these respective sets the general outline of a gep model is as follows mehdizadeh et al 2017a 1 generation of an initial population of chromosomes producing chromosomes from the initial population is done randomly according to existing information regarding the intended process 2 expression of the chromosomes as the expression tree 3 evaluation of the efficiency or fitness of each chromosome 4 selection of the best chromosomes to modify and reproduce to form new chromosomes the modifications and reproductions are carried out via several genetic operators namely mutation inversion recombination and transposition in order to solve a problem using gep five main steps should be followed first a fitness function is selected in the current study the root mean square error rmse was selected as the fitness function second both sets of functions i e ln x e x x x 3 x 2 x 3 sinx c o s x a r c t a n x and the terminals i e the gep model inputs and outputs are selected third the architecture of the chromosomes is determined fourth the connecting or linking function is defined the current study uses an addition function finally the rates of the genetic operators are selected for the present study the parameters used in the gep model are noted in table 2 3 3 2 mars model the mars model is a non parametric technique first introduced by friedman 1991 given its non parametric nature the structure of the mars model is unknown before the modeling process in this model the time series data are divided into several subsets and then the appropriate basis functions are fitted to the data as such the problem space in mars is divided into several intervals of input variables and individual splines are then fitted to each interval friedman 1991 each spline i e basis function is specified at a certain interval and the endpoints of an interval are called knots the basis function is applied to illustrate data for each spline which is specified for each two knots sephton 2001 these basis functions representing the functional relationship between the input and output variables can be written as follows mehdizadeh 2018a 7 y max 0 c x 8 y max 0 x c where y and x denote the output and input respectively and c denotes a threshold value named the knot the mars model procedure is implemented in a two step procedure in the first or forward step the modeling process is initiated by choosing a fixed term which is the average of target values next the basis functions are added to the fixed term continuously until the sum of square errors is significantly reduced the initial model tends to be over fitted therefore in the next step called the backward step over fitting is minimized through the elimination of less effective basis functions to this end a generalized cross validation criterion is applied to the model to determine the least effective basis functions the mars model generates a relationship in the form of eq 9 as follows mehdizadeh 2018a 9 y f x a 0 m 1 m a m b m x where a 0 a m b m x and m are a constant term the coefficients of the m th basis function the m th basis function and the number of nonzero terms in the model respectively 3 4 implementation of models 3 4 1 single and hybrid ts based models the single ar and ma time series models were fitted to the normalized and standardized streamflow datasets all time series models e g ar ma and arch can model the target variable using eqs 3 6 additionally the following procedures were used to develop the hybrid time series based models namely the ar arch and ma arch models fathian et al 2019b 1 the residual time series of the optimum ar i e ε t and ma i e ε t models fitted to the normalized and standardized data were calculated specifically the residuals of ar and ma models were used to construct the hybrid ar arch and ma arch models to improve monthly streamflow estimation 2 the obtained ε t 2 and ε t 2 values were input into the arch model this produces an arch model fit to the square errors of ar and ma i e ε t 2 and ε t 2 3 next the first order arch model i e arch 1 was applied to model the output data as follows 10 σ t 2 α 0 α 1 ε t 1 2 ε t σ t e t f o r a r a r c h 11 σ t 2 α 0 α 1 ε t 1 2 ε t σ t e t f o r m a a r c h all variables and parameters in the above mentioned equations have been defined in section 3 2 2 it is important that the modeled streamflow time series be both de standardized and de normalized to obtain estimated streamflow data in its true form with the units being cubic meter per second m3 s 3 4 2 ai based models in the current study the performances of the ai models namely mars and gep were evaluated under two different strategies 3 4 2 1 strategy 1 local analysis approach under the local analysis strategy the streamflow for each target station is predicted using the original data of that station 3 4 2 2 strategy 2 external analysis approach under the external analysis approach the data of a neighboring station is used to estimate streamflow at each target station table 3 sums up the various input combinations applied to develop the ai models for both the local and external data analyses approaches for example in the mars1 and gep1 local analysis models the streamflow of the current month was estimated using data from the previous month i e a one month lag q t 1 conversely for the mars1 and gep1 models under the external analysis approach the streamflow data of the same month q t at a nearby station were used for streamflow modeling of each target station 3 5 performance statistics for model evaluation the present study evaluates the performance of the fitted models i e the single ar and ma the hybrid ar arch and ma arch time series models and the mars and gep models under both local and external analyses approaches in terms of their ability to accurately estimate monthly streamflow by applying three statistical indicators namely the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r the calculations for these indicators can be found in eqs 12 14 as below mehdizadeh et al 2019 12 rmse i 1 n q ob i q es i 2 n 13 mae i 1 n q ob i q es i n 14 r i 1 n q ob i q ob q es i q es i 1 n q ob i q ob 2 i 1 n q es i q es 2 where q ob i q es i q ob q es and n denote the i th observed monthly streamflow the i th estimated monthly streamflow the average of the observed monthly streamflow the average of the estimated monthly streamflow and the number of total observations which are separately considered for the training and testing datasets respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of data normalization and standardization as noted the normalization and standardization of the time series data are necessary for the application of the modeling procedures the following equations were used to normalize the monthly streamflow datasets of the studied stations q n ln q o 22 01 for beinerahe roodbar station q n ln q o 9 28 for pole astaneh station q n ln q o 5 08 for port elgin station q n ln q o 2 433 for walkerton station skewness coefficients were computed for the observed monthly streamflow datasets of each station as 2 36 2 48 1 79 and 1 88 for the beinerahe roodbar pole astaneh port elgin and walkerton stations respectively however the skewness coefficients for the normalized datasets were calculated as 2 05e 06 7 55e 05 5 46e 05 and 5 69e 05 respectively these comparatively trivial values confirm the suitable normalization of the streamflow datasets furthermore the values of the mean and standard deviation for the standardized datasets were found to be 0 and 0 99 respectively this supports the argument that the data have been properly standardized 4 2 results of the single ts based models after developing and running the ar and ma time series models the best fitted models were chosen based on their aic values with the models achieving the lowest aic values labeled most suitable the equations of the optimal ar and ma models are presented in table 4 and the corresponding performance statistics for both training and testing phases are presented in table 5 for the iranian stations the ma 9 model in the training phase and the ar 11 model in the testing phase at the beinerahe roodbar station as well as the ar 1 model in both the training and testing phases at the pole astaneh station demonstrate the most satisfactory statistics compared to the alternate model at each station negligible differences exist between the performance of the single ar and ma models for the port elgin station in both the training and testing phases although the ma 4 model shows a slightly better performance than the ar 1 in the training phase and slightly poorer results than the ar 1 model in the testing phase for the walkerton station the performance of the ma 4 model in the training phase is slightly better than the ar 1 model however during the testing phase the results show that the ar 1 model outperforms the ma 4 model at this station 4 3 results of the hybrid ts based models as previously discussed the ar and ma models were hybridized with the arch model to improve their streamflow estimation accuracy to this end the square errors of ar and ma models i e ε t 2 and ε t 2 were used to fit the arch model to the data the arch model captures the streamflow data residuals obtained from the ar and ma models to reduce the variation and uncertainty of model estimation in the residual time series the relationships generated by fitting the optimal arch model to the streamflow datasets are listed in table 4 while the performance indices of the hybrid time series models i e ar arch and ma arch are shown in table 5 in general the hybrid models outperform the corresponding uncoupled models for example the performance statistics of the ma 6 model at the pole astaneh station during the test phase are rmse 65 08 m3 s mae 35 91 m3 s and r 0 693 these same statistics improve to rmse 22 84 m3 s mae 10 88 m3 s and r 0 961 for the corresponding hybrid model i e ma 6 arch 1 the rmse values of the best performing hybrid models with bolded statistics in table 5 i e ma 9 arch 1 at beinerahe roodbar ma 6 arch 1 at pole astaneh ma 4 arch 1 at port elgin and ar 1 arch 1 at walkerton and are respectively 69 81 64 90 58 44 and 55 85 lower than the corresponding values for the single time series models the absence or presence of over fitting problems during the modeling procedure help recognize whether modeling techniques such as the ts models are appropriate for a given situation fathian et al 2019c the over fitted models usually present reasonable or excellent results during the training phase but perform poorly during the testing phase comparing the performance of the single and hybrid models for the training and testing stages demonstrates that the single and hybrid models have acceptable accuracies therefore indicating the absence of over fitting in the developed models this trend that suggests the superiority of hybrid models is not observed for all hydroclimatic datasets and all different climatic regions for example the results for the beinerahe roodbar station show that in the training phase the rmse value for both hybrid models is higher than for the original models however the mae values are lower and the r values are higher for the hybrid models in the testing phase the ma 9 arch 1 model outperformed all others for the beinerahe roodbar station analysis suggests that the hybrid models may over or under estimate the peak values at several points leading to higher rmse values for the hybrid models compared to the unmodified models this discrepancy supports the modarres and ouarda 2013a and romilly 2005 studies that reported on the challenges of hybridizing with arch models using different evaluation criteria for rainfall and temperature time series respectively the authors reported that in their case study despite the use of generalized arch i e garch model as a typical type of arch the capturing of the heteroscedasticity of the residuals of a linear ts model potentially increased the performance of the hybrid time series therefore there is no guarantee of better results from using a garch model the arch can often but not always capture the autocorrelation behavior of the residual time series which reduces the uncertainty in estimating the values of target data however as modarres and ouarda 2013a and romilly 2005 reported this property may not be observed for all hydrological and meteorological data comparing the performance of the hybrid models reveals that for the beinerahe roodbar station the ma 9 arch 1 model performs best in both training and testing phases for the pole astaneh and port elgin stations the ar 1 arch 1 performs best in the training phase while the ma 6 arch 1 for pole astaneh and the ma 4 arch 1 for port elgin perform best during the testing phase for the walkerton station the ma 4 arch 1 is superior in the training phase and the ar 1 arch 1 performs best during the testing phase see table 5 there are negligible differences between the performances of the hybrid ar arch and ma arch models for the two canadian stations in both training and testing phases for the two iranian stations however based on all the performance measures used in this study there is a significant difference between the performances of the hybrid models in both phases to further analyze the performance of the hybrid models compared to the unmodified models the best performing hybrid model statistical analysis results shown in bold in table 5 and the corresponding single model were selected during the test phase then comparative scatter plots were developed as shown in fig 3 in this figure the dotted red lines denote the line of equality i e 1 1 and the blue lines represent the regression lines fitted to the observed and estimated streamflow data it is clear that fewer scatters dispersions are present in the hybrid models around the 1 1 line indicating a better performance on the part of the hybrid models compared to the single models this trend has been reported in the literature when using hybrid time series models as well as for the integration of ai techniques with wavelet analysis and time series models fathian et al 2019b c mehdizadeh et al 2017b 2018 2019 mehdizadeh 2018b mehdizadeh and kozekalani sales 2018 kisi and cimen 2011 modarres and ouarda 2013b ravansalar et al 2017 4 4 results of the ai based models using the local analysis approach as noted the present study evaluated the accuracy of the given ai models under both local and external analyses approaches tables 6 9 summarize the error statistics computed for the beinerahe roodbar pole astaneh port elgin and walkerton stations respectively the performance indicators of the models under the local analysis approach suggest that the mars and gep techniques have the ability to estimate the target month s streamflow using streamflow data from previous months slight differences exist between the estimation precision of the mars and gep models at the studied stations with the mars model outperforming the gep model 4 5 results of the ai based models using the external analysis approach using the external analysis approach the model performance can be assessed when there is a good correlation between the streamflow time series of neighboring stations located on a specific river fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the streamflow data for the two iranian stations and the two canadian stations correlation coefficients of 0 810 and 0 986 were obtained for the iranian and canadian stations respectively this relatively high data correlation supports the use of the external analysis approach in which streamflow time series data from a nearby station is utilized to estimate the streamflow values of each target station for example the streamflow data of port elgin as a nearby station was used to estimate the streamflow time series of walkerton as a target station and vice versa this trend was also seen for iran s stations located on sefidrood river the accuracy of the ai models under the external analysis approach was significantly higher than under the local analysis approach especially for the canadian stations port elgin and walkerton as an example the rmse mae and r error statistics for the best ai models during the test phase under external data analysis are respectively 6 36 m3 s 4 38 m3 s and 0 993 for gep4 at port elgin and 3 19 m3 s 2 18 m3 s and 0 993 for mars1 at walkerton the corresponding values for the models under local data analysis were 38 68 m3 s 24 67 m3 s and 0 705 at port elgin and 19 51 m3 s 12 49 m3 s and 0 703 at walkerton the rates of reduction in the rmse values for the best models under an external condition i e mars4 at beinerahe roodbar gep3 at pole astaneh gep4 at port elgin and mars1 at walkerton compared to the corresponding models using local evaluation are 25 48 31 71 83 56 83 65 respectively assessing the performance of ai based models under both local and external conditions demonstrates that over fitting did not occur for the models developed in this study these models performed similarly accurately for both training and testing stages similar results were observed for the single and hybrid ts based models the performance of the ai models under the external analysis approach and the corresponding models under the local analysis approach are graphically compared in fig 5 the performance statistics of the superior models for the studied stations in the testing phase have been highlighted in bold font in tables 6 9 the analysis shows that the monthly streamflow data estimated by the superior models under the external analysis approach are more optimally fitted to the dotted line representing equality 1 1 compared to the estimates of the same models under the local analysis approach 4 6 comparison of the ts and ai based models upon evaluating the performance of the single ts and ai models under the local analysis approach it is apparent that the mars and gep models are in general more accurate than the single ar and ma models for modeling streamflow at the beinerahe roodbar and pole astaneh stations during the training phase using data from the port elgin and walkerton stations the single ts and ai models under local analysis show similar results in general under local analysis the ar and ma models outperform the mars and gep models at the port elgin and walkerton stations during the testing phase notably the best fitted ar arch and ma arch hybrid models generally perform much better than the ai models under the local analysis approach for all four stations in both the training and testing phases with the exception of the training phase of the hybrid ts models and the testing phase of the ar arch model at the beinerahe roodbar station comparing the performance of the ts and ai models under the external analysis approach for the two iranian stations demonstrates the better accuracy of ai models over the single i e ar and ma and hybrid i e ar arch and ma arch models except during the testing phase of the ma arch model at the beinerahe roodbar station and during the testing phase of both the ar arch and ma arch models at the pole astaneh station in addition the mars and gep models under the external analysis approach outperformed the single and hybrid ts models for the canadian stations of port elgin and walkerton the performance of ts models is better than that of ai models in some cases and vice versa the ai models outperform the ts models for other cases mehdizadeh et al 2018 2019 and fathian et al 2019c reported that hydrological time series such as streamflow consist of two terms namely the stochastic and deterministic such that the ts and ai models can capture and model the stochastic and deterministic terms of the streamflow data respectively a superior performance from the ts based model compared to the ai based model means that it can better model the stochastic term than capturing the deterministic term via the ai based model conversely an ai model is more accurate than a ts model when the ai model can capture the deterministic term with a higher level of precision than estimating the stochastic term through the ts model 5 conclusions the current research aimed to compare the performance of monthly streamflow estimation based on time series and artificial intelligence models at two hydrometric stations on the sefidrood river in iran as well as two stations on the saugeen river in canada to achieve this two single models ar and ma two hybrid ts based models ar arch and ma arch and two ai based models mars and gep were applied to the data from the stations and their performances evaluated the ai models were analyzed under both local and external analysis approaches results indicated that the single ma and ar models for the beinerahe roodbar station during the training and testing phases as well as the single ar model for the pole astaneh station in both phases had superior accuracy compared to other single ts models there was minimal difference between the performance of the single ar and ma models at the stations in canada specifically the ma and ar models in the training and testing phases respectively had slightly better performances than the other single ts models developed regarding the hybrid ts models the results demonstrated that generally the developed hybrid ar arch and ma arch models provided much better streamflow estimates than the single ar and ma models at the studied stations a comparison of the performance of the ai models showed a higher precision of the models under the external analysis approach compared to the same model scenario under local analysis these results suggest that the selection of the neighboring stations for modeling the streamflow time series of each target station was appropriate in general the ai models under both local and external analysis approaches showed superior performances compared with the single and hybrid ts models for the iranian stations additionally the ai models under external analysis performed better than the single and hybrid ts models for the canadian stations the ai models under the external analysis approach during the training phase and the hybrid ts models i e ma arch during the test phase for iran s stations and the ai models under external analysis for the canadian stations were the best performing models the most accurate estimates of monthly streamflow during the test phase were achieved by the hybrid ma 9 arch 1 at beinerahe roodbar rmse 17 55 m3 s mae 10 27 m3 s r 0 982 the hybrid ma 6 arch 1 at pole astaneh rmse 22 84 m3 s mae 10 88 m3 s r 0 961 the gep4 under an external condition at port elgin rmse 6 36 m3 s mae 4 38 m3 s r 0 993 and the mars1 under an external condition at walkerton rmse 3 19 m3 s mae 2 18 m3 s r 0 993 as mentioned the non linear arch captured the conditional variance of streamflow time series while this is not considered in the linear ar and ma models this feature is an advantage of hybrid ar arch and ma arch models over the single ar and ma on the other hand as concluded for the beinerahe roodbar station utilizing the hybrid ts based models does not necessarily lead to better results compared to single models furthermore evaluating the performance of ai based models under both local and external conditions revealed that an external assessment is worthwhile when local streamflow data are not available for the ai models since they often obtain higher precision than the local evaluation the results obtained in the current study suggest that the hybrid ts models offer superior performance compared to the single models for streamflow analysis it is suggested that further efforts be directed at developing other types of hybrid models for the forecasting of streamflow and other hydrological variables including the exploration of alternate ts and ai modeling approaches such as arma arima garch ann anfis svm etc declaration of competing interest the
