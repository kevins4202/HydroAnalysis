industry that needs an urgent solution bioremediation an environmentally friendly biological process has grown in popularity and is a recognized method for treating sites contaminated by crude oil compared to physical and chemical methods 44 although the current bioremediation techniques are time consuming and are not able perform well at high organic loading of pollutant very few literature reports are available on indole biodegradation in bioreactor 45 46 in the present study an efficient biodegradation process was developed for indole biodegradation in bioreactor using potential microbial consortium in order to achieve higher efficiency and complete mineralization of indole along with its fermentation metabolites which are complex in nature development of potential microbial consortium was attempted 30 bacterial strains were isolated from petroleum contaminated sites at assam india on the basis of their ability to degrade crude oil and pahs compounds like indole the isolated strains were evaluated for ei24 oil spreading test and for crude oil indole degradation ability the bacterial strains rb 10 rb 12 and rb 29 showed the maximum ei24 oil clearing zone in oil spreading test and crude oil indole degradation ability were used for consortium the morphological biochemical and molecular characterization confirmed that the isolated strains rb 10 rb 12 and rb 29 belonged to the species alcaligenes faecalis pseudomonas guariconensis and pseudomonas monteilii respectively similar to our study many reports have shown that alcaligenes pseudomonas bacillus microbacterium streptomyces rhodococcus arthrobacter micrococcus enterobacter and pseudoxanthomonas are effective in producing biosurfactant and they have been utilized in a wide range of applications including bioremediation 42 47 51 to further optimize the degradation process parameters ph temperature and indole crude oil concentration were optimized they have substantial impact on bacterial

detected which is a metabolite of indole biodegradation which has been reported in indole metabolic pathway by claus and kutzner 18 kamath and vaidyanathan 24 tesso and liu 25 and arora et al 9 indole biodegradation into catechol gentisate and anthranilate are the three majorly reported routes 9 56 the catechol pathway was studied in an indole mineralizing gram negative bacterium isolated from tap

the values calculated by monod model were μ max 0 165 per day and k s 7 91 mg l and by teissier edwards model were μ max 0 321 per day k s 11 5 mg l and k i substrate inhibition constant 33 2 mg l lakshmi and velan 39 studied five different kinetic models monod haldane yano edward and competitive inhibition for phenanthrene degradation 100 mg l by alcaligenes faecalis mvmb1 the maximum specific growth rate μmax ks and k i phenanthrene found in the range of 0 03 0 18 h 12 12 36 2 mg l and 118 324 mg l respectively to test the robustness of the developed consortium its crude oil biodegradation ability was also assessed the reduction of viscosity was observed from 1 623 n s m2 to 0 901 n s m2 at the end of 30th day when 2 v v crude oil was used as carbon source which are comparable with the studies performed by roy et al 42 and baruah et al 58 during crude biodegradation experiments 0 5 3 v v and a maximum value of 43 831 ei24 was observed when 2 crude oil was used as carbon source which is comparable to the results reported by turkovskaya et al 59 wherein pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was cultivated on glycerol as carbon source for ei24 studies the developed bacterial consortium can breakdown indole as well as crude oil and also may be effective in the cleanup of petroleum waste contaminants 5 conclusion a consortium was developed using alcaligenes faecalis rb 10 pseudomonas guariconensis rb 12 and pseudomonas monteilii rb 29 isolated from petroleum contaminated site the biological process was developed for indole biodegradation by optimized physical and kinetic parameters indole biodegradation was studied in bioreactor and 84 50 cod removal and 0 50 fractional toc toct t toct 0 reduction achieved the detection of catechol by gc ms which is a metabolite of indole degradation confirmed the mineralization of indole microbial growth was studied and kinetics parameters were estimated by monod model for indole biodegradation the contaminant load has a significant impact on microbial specific growth rate and thereby also affects the overall waste treatment time it was observed that the microbial consortium ability has a significant impact on the biological waste treatment process efficacy as compared to individual microbes further robustness of consortium was also assessed and found to be promising for crude oil biodegradation the results of

31 05 it can be observed that ei24 for 2 v v crude oil has maximum value i e 43 83 on the 30th day of the experiment the crude oil biodegraded sample s increased ei24 and decreased viscosity indicates that the bacterial consortium of rb 10 rb 12 and rb 29 can degrade crude oil efficiently 4 discussion crude oil pollution of soil and other ecosystems is a global issue associated with the petroleum industry that needs an urgent solution bioremediation an environmentally friendly biological process has grown in popularity and is a recognized method for treating sites contaminated by crude oil compared to physical and chemical methods 44 although the current bioremediation techniques are time consuming and are not able perform well at high organic loading of pollutant very few literature reports are available on indole biodegradation in bioreactor 45 46 in the present study an efficient biodegradation process was developed for indole biodegradation in bioreactor using potential microbial consortium in order to achieve higher efficiency and complete mineralization of indole along with its fermentation metabolites which are complex in nature development of potential microbial consortium was attempted 30 bacterial strains were isolated from petroleum contaminated sites at assam india on the basis of their ability to degrade crude oil and pahs compounds like indole the isolated strains were evaluated for ei24 oil spreading test and for crude oil indole degradation ability the bacterial strains rb 10 rb 12 and rb 29 showed the maximum ei24 oil clearing zone in oil spreading test and crude oil indole degradation ability were used for consortium the morphological biochemical and molecular characterization confirmed that the isolated strains rb 10 rb 12 and rb 29 belonged to the species alcaligenes faecalis pseudomonas guariconensis and pseudomonas monteilii respectively similar to our study many reports have shown that alcaligenes pseudomonas bacillus microbacterium streptomyces rhodococcus arthrobacter micrococcus enterobacter and pseudoxanthomonas are effective in producing biosurfactant and they have been utilized in a wide range of applications including bioremediation 42 47 51 to further optimize the degradation process parameters ph temperature and indole crude oil concentration were optimized they have substantial impact on bacterial growth and metabolism 50 54 thereafter indole biodegradation was studied in bioreactor at optimized process parameters and samples were withdrawn and analyzed for cod removal toc reduction and degradation metabolites 84 86 of cod reduction in 8 days was observed which is comparable to 50 96 cod removal in 64 days four stages sequencing batch reactors reported by yang et al 55 catechol was detected which is a metabolite of indole biodegradation which has been reported in indole metabolic pathway by claus and kutzner 18 kamath and vaidyanathan 24 tesso and liu 25 and arora et al 9 indole biodegradation into catechol gentisate and anthranilate are the three majorly reported routes 9 56 the catechol pathway was studied in an indole mineralizing gram negative bacterium isolated from tap water 56 indole was transformed to indoxyl in the first step of the catechol pathway and indoxyl was next converted to 2 3 dihydroxyindole isatin n formylanthranilic acid anthranilic acid salicylic acid and catechol intermediates were then further mineralized by microbial species 56 monod kinetics model was applied to study the effect of increasing indole concentration on specific growth rate of each species it was observed that the specific growth rate increased exponentially with change in substrate concentration from 20 to 120 mg l and when the concentration of the substrate was further increased to 140 mg l a slight decrease in specific growth rate was observed thus 120 mg l of maximum indole concentration was decided as maximum initial substrate concentration was further

growth rate μmax ks and k i phenanthrene found in the range of 0 03 0 18 h 12 12 36 2 mg l and 118 324 mg l respectively to test the robustness of the developed consortium its crude oil biodegradation ability was also assessed the reduction of viscosity was observed from 1 623 n s m2 to 0 901 n s m2 at the end of 30th day when 2 v v crude oil was used as carbon source which are comparable with the studies performed by roy et al 42 and baruah et al 58 during crude biodegradation experiments 0 5 3 v v and a maximum value of 43 831 ei24 was observed when 2 crude oil was used as carbon source which is comparable to the results reported by turkovskaya et al 59 wherein pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was cultivated on glycerol as carbon source for ei24 studies the developed bacterial consortium can breakdown indole as well as crude oil and also may be effective in the cleanup of petroleum waste contaminants 5 conclusion a consortium was developed using alcaligenes faecalis rb 10 pseudomonas

parameters indole biodegradation was studied in bioreactor and 84 50 cod removal and 0 50 fractional toc toct t toct 0 reduction achieved the detection of catechol by gc ms which is a metabolite of indole degradation confirmed the mineralization of indole microbial growth was studied and kinetics parameters were estimated by monod model for indole biodegradation the contaminant load has a significant impact on microbial specific growth rate and thereby also affects the overall waste treatment time it was observed that the microbial consortium ability has a significant impact on the

12556,this study examines the effect of different rates and modes of supplementary aeration on the treatment of synthetic septic tank effluent in a lab scale unplanted constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc along with bioenergy generation the experiment was conducted in 4 sequential phases 1 the cell was operated with no aeration na 2 3 the cathode layer was continuously aerated under different aeration rates ca i and ca ii and 4 the cathode layer was intermittently aerated ia results showed that the dissolved oxygen gradient caused by ia formed aerobic and anoxic zones in cw mfc and promoted total nitrogen removal the best performance was observed with intermittent aeration where the maximum removal efficiencies of cod 96 8 3 3 tn 62 3 2 1 tkn 68 3 2 0 and nh3 64 8 2 3 were achieved furthermore this treatment efficiency corresponded with enhanced bioenergy generation under the ia regime achieving maximum power output 7 5 mw m2 highest average voltage output 0 399 0 02 v coulombic efficiency 1 94 and normalized energy recovery 1 4 wh m3 continuous aeration however induced an adverse effect on energy generation due to excessive oxygen penetration into the anode region nitrate accumulation was also observed as a sign of an incomplete denitrification process under the continuous aeration regime overall it can be concluded that the intermittently aerated cw mfc not only lowers operational costs but improves effectiveness in terms of the nitrogen removal process in the treatment of septic tank effluent keywords supplementary aeration septic tank effluent constructed wetland microbial fuel cell energy recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction septic tanks have been widely used as a cost effective onsite primary treatment for domestic wastewater in peri urban and rural areas however septic tank effluent ste still has a high content of suspended solids chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen which requires an appropriate post treatment technology 1 research to date has worked on numerous treatment technologies for further polishing treatment of ste such as constructed wetlands 2 3 circulating fluidized bed bioreactors cfbbr 4 moving bed biological reactors mbbr 5 photobioreactors 6 and microbial desalination cells 1 the cost and energy associated with these technologies along with complications in the treatment processes and environmental concerns adversely impact their effectiveness as sustainable technologies for ste treatment among the technologies however constructed wetlands cws stand out as a nature inspired technology having lower operation and maintenance costs and energy usage while cw offers a reliable and sustainable treatment process they do still present some intrinsic challenges for wastewater treatment such as insufficient treatment efficiency of nutrients and greenhouse gas emissions 7 these challenges have limited the application of this technology to work as an efficient secondary treatment process to overcome the limitations of cw technology and to provide additional benefits a merger of cw and microbial fuel cell mfc technologies into a so called cw mfc process has emerged mfc is an innovative bioelectrochemical approach for naturally converting waste into energy through the metabolic activity of electrogenic bacteria 8 recently there has been a growing trend toward fruitful commercialization and scaling up of fuel cell based technologies 9 novel bioelectrochemical systems such as mfcs microbial electrolysis cells mecs 10 11 and microbial desalination cells mdcs 12 work as versatile technologies providing bioenergy 9 along with feedstock treatment 13 nutrient removal 14 resource recovery 15 and biosensing potential 16 from these a combination of mfc with cw is seen as most likely to yield significant benefits the advantages of an integrated cw mfc compared with individual cw and mfc processes have been comprehensively investigated by ebrahimi et al 7 the findings have shown the greater practical value of an integrated system possessing superior sustainability performance with lower greenhouse gas emissions and superior treatment efficiency energy generation is also promoted as an additional advantage of integrated systems with many potential uses such as monitoring wetland health without external power input mfc based technology such as cw mfc needs an oxic anoxic environment for the anaerobic oxidation of organic matter and releasing electrons and the aerobic zone to complete the reduction reaction of released electrons the main difference between a traditional cw mfc and a mfc is utilizing the stratified redox gradient which naturally exists along a cw column due to the presence of an anaerobic region near the bottom of a cw and an aerobic region adjacent to the air water interface 17 nevertheless both systems utilize the chemical energy accumulated in organic matter molecules through the catalytic activity of anode respiring bacteria to generate electrical energy 7 during recent years there has been a growing body of literature that recognises the importance of design and operational parameters in improving the performance of cw mfc systems investigating both planted 18 and unplanted 19 cells it is now well established that the optimum efficiency of cw mfc systems depends on numerous design variables such as reactor configuration 20 substrate characteristics 21 22 the electrode material used in the reactor 23 24 operational conditions 25 26 etc these variables directly affect key operating parameters of cw mfcs such as oxidation reduction potential 27 internal external resistance 28 oxygen demand 29 anode bacterial activity 23 30 and contaminant removal 25 a comprehensive taxonomy of effective construction and operational variables in cw mfc performance has been identified by ebrahimi et al 31 it has been clearly shown that despite achieving promising results in wastewater treatment using cw mfc so far these systems have not reached their potential being unable to go further than the pilot scale using oxygen as the main electron acceptor in the cathode layer is among the most convenient strategy for developing cw mfc systems oxygen has a high redox potential compared to the other electron acceptors and it can be directly provided by exposing the cathode electrode to the air 32 however the natural oxygen supply from the air might not be sufficient to meet reaction demand additional oxygen can be easily supplied into cw mfc by various low cost strategies such as bubbling air in the water tidal flow feeding air pipes frequent water level fluctuation and passive aeration pumps 33 providing supplementary aeration in the cathodic area can improve cw mfc efficiency through several mechanisms the supplementary aeration enhances electricity generation in mfc based technologies primarily due to the high redox potential of oxygen it will also provide several advantages to cw systems 29 for example enhancing oxygen availability can improve mineralization and decrease clogging resulting from biofilm formation in upper layers 34 35 artificial aeration can also be very helpful during cold weather when plants are dormant and cannot provide adequate oxygen 36 finally according to previous studies aerated cws can surpass non aerated systems in terms of nitrogen removal 35 37 however despite its clear advantages little knowledge is available in the literature about the effect of different rates of aeration on nitrogen removal and power generation in cw mfcs hence the main focus of this work is to study oxygen supplementation in the cw mfc process as the main limiting factor in cw mfc performance therefore the treatability of specific tank effluent with a c n ratio of 8 has been examined under different aeration regimes at the cathode area in order to assess the overall performance of a cw mfc fed with septic tank effluent a number of critical treatment parameters cod tn tkn no3 and nh4 removal and operational parameters voltage output power density current density energy recovery and coulombic efficiency were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 septic tank effluent characteristics the ste characteristics generally depend on several designs and operational factors such as septic tank depth hydraulic retention time temperature organic and hydraulic loading rates etc the synthetic ste wastewater used in this study is composed of glucose 225 mg l yeast extract 37 5 mg l dried milk 150 mg l urea 37 5 mg l nh4cl 75 na2hpo4 12h2o 125 mg l khco3 62 5 mg l nahco3 162 5 mg l mgso4 7h2o 62 5 mg l feso4 h2o 2 5 mg l and cacl2 6h2o 0 5 mg l the wastewater composition was chosen to provide the typical average characteristics of septic tank effluent table 1 depicts the typical characteristics of ste used in this study and those extracted from different sources 2 2 cw mfc construction the images of the lab scale cw mfc used in this study and a schematic are shown in fig 1 the system was constructed using plexiglass sheets with an internal square section of 200 mm by 200 mm and a height of 480 mm the net liquid volume of cw mfc was 6 1 l the bed media from the bottom to the top consisted of 165 mm of gravel with a particle size of 10 12 mm as the support layer 50 mm of granular activated carbon gac with a particle size of 2 36 4 75 mm as anode layer 130 mm of gravel with the particle size of 3 5 mm as the middle layer and 50 mm of gac with a particle size of 2 36 4 75 mm as the cathode layer all filter media were washed and cleaned before use in cw mfc the coarse gravel used in the triangular section located at the bottom of cw mfc helped in the uniform distribution of wastewater influent upward into the cell four sampling ports were installed at specified locations s1 s2 s3 and s4 with 20 180 300 and 400 mm distances from the bottom of the cw mfc module as shown in fig 1 the stainless steel plates ssps with uniform 10 mm holes were used for both anode 170 170 mm and cathode 190 190 mm electrodes two additional holes each having a 60 mm diameter were incorporated into the cathode electrode allowing for plant placement while giving the same effective surface area of 0 0224 m2 for both anode and cathode electrodes the cathode electrode was placed in the soil water interface 15 mm under the wastewater surface while the anode electrode was placed 185 mm from the bottom the distance between electrodes was kept at 205 mm to increase the electron attachment and electrical conductivity both electrodes were placed within a layer of granular activated carbon gac with a height of 50 mm gac was employed to form the composite electrode because of its compatibility with electrogenic bacteria and low cost 41 electrodes were connected to an external resistance rext of 1000 ω using insulated copper wires applying an optimum rext is important as it affects both treatment efficiency and maximum power output high rext results in lowering current output limited microbial activity and likely less treatment efficiency while low external resistance directly reduces output voltage 28 31 comparability of the results with the other research studies was also another factor in decision making regarding external resistance considering all these three factors an external resistance of 1000 ω was selected and kept unchanged throughout the study 2 3 cw mfc inoculation and start up before starting the experiments ssp electrodes were soaked in 0 1 m hcl and subsequently 0 1 m naoh for 24 h and then they were rinsed with deionized water to eliminate any oil contamination concentrated anaerobic sludge collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wollongong nsw australia was used to inoculate the anode layer of cw mfc two mature plants dwarf papyrus with an average stem height of 300 mm and root length of 40 mm were transplanted into the top layer cathode zone of the cw mfc papyrus has been used successfully in different cw mfc systems showing high tolerance to nutrient rich wastewater 42 the cw mfc cell was acclimatized for nearly 7 weeks with synthetic wastewater until full enrichment of the anode electrode and reaching a stable voltage 43 synthetic wastewater was fed continuously by a peristaltic pump to the cw mfc at a flow rate of 2 ml min with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 50 8 h to ensure bacterial growth plants used in this study went gradually through wilting yellowing and curling of the leaves and they eventually died the dead plant biomass was removed from the cell before starting the cw mfc operation and cw mfc in this study was hence considered an unplanted cell gradual plant acclimatization to the high nutrient content wastewater before transplanting them into cw mfc may have prevented plant death 2 4 cw mfc operation during operation synthetic wastewater was continuously fed into the bottom of the cell using a peristaltic pump providing a constant organic loading rate olr of 28 8 g cod m 2 day 1 188 9 g cod m 3 day 1 with the wastewater moving upward to the cathode compartment the performance of cw mfc was analyzed under four sequential phases in this study 1 na in which the system was operated with no aeration 2 ca i the cathode layer was continuously aerated with an aeration rate of 6 lpm 3 ca ii the cathode layer was continuously aerated with an aeration rate of 3 lpm and 4 ia in which the cathode layer was intermittently aerated where aeration was applied for 2 h a day at a flow rate of 3 lpm starting at 8 00 am for the remaining 22 h of the day no aeration was applied three aeration spargers connected to an aquarium air pump aqua one air pump 12 000 were fixed at the cathode layer 30 mm below the wastewater free surface to supply air into the cathode area airflow during the intermittent aeration phase was controlled by an automatic on off timer the system was operated at room temperature 20 22 c for 290 days in this study 2 5 sample collection and analysis this study consisted of 4 sequential sets of experiments to evaluate the aeration effect in cw mfc each set lasted for two months the effluent samples were collected twice a week during cw mfc operation and all water samples were tested in triplicates cod and nutrient concentration were measured by uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 3900 according to the standard method 44 do and ph were measured using a do meter professional plus ysi n959 and a ph meter thermo scientific orion respectively cell voltages produced by cw mfc were recorded every 15 min using a data acquisition system ni 9208 the current was calculated using ohm s law i u r where u is the measured voltage v and rext is the external resistance ω the current and power were normalized by the projected surface area of the anode electrode to obtain the current and power density normalized energy recovery was also calculated based on the equations described in ebrahimi et al 7 coulombic efficiency ce was calculated by integrating the current measured over time relative to the maximum theoretical current which can be achieved by substrate degradation in the system eq 1 ce shows the efficiency by which electrons are transferred within the system to complete electrochemical reactions 45 1 ce m 0 t it fb cv 100 where

do performs a crucial role in the microbial activity in cw mfc hence the aerobic and anaerobic conditions of the cw mfc were assessed by monitoring do concentration during working hours from 8 00 am to 6 00 pm fig 2 indicates the full profile of do within the cw mfc column during na and ca modes showing wide ranging variation through the depth of the cw column fig 2a given that unlike the other regimes do values varied constantly throughout the day in ia the do variation under ia condition is shown in fig 2b the anaerobic anoxic environment was established on the anode layer at 180 mm from the bottom while the aerobic environment was observed above the reactor the do concentration varied in the range of 1 25 to 8 09 mg l under ca i 6 lpm regime 0 91 to 6 22 mg l under ca ii 3lpm regime and 0 57 to 2 07 mg l under the no aeration regime na within cw mfc column the low do level at the bottom of the reactor anode region indicated that the anode layer was a reductive environment which enabled organic matter degradation by anaerobic bacteria and produced electrons while increasing the do level in the cathode layer using external aeration could enhance heterotrophic microorganisms activity without lowering denitrification a similar do profile was also reported by oon et al 46 daily do measurement under the ia regime fig 2b showed that do quickly increased to peak values an average do of 8 36 mg l in the cathode layer when aeration was commenced and then was gradually depleted to a do concentration of 1 14 mg l over time when aeration was stopped therefore aerobic and anaerobic zones could be simultaneously present due to the stratification of biofilms under an intermittent aeration regime other studies have also shown the existence of micro aerobic anaerobic regions and biofilm stratification with intermittent aeration in cw 34 47 ph analysis showed that cw mfc under all operational conditions had a weak alkaline effluent with a ph value in the range of 6 81 7 63 in non aerated cw mfc and 7 15 to 7 91 in the aerated system these results reflect those of gonzalez et al 48 who also reported an effluent ph in the range of 6 91 to 7 59 in a non aerated unplanted cw mfc it should be noted that ph in aerated systems was slightly higher and more stable than in non aerated systems providing optimal conditions for the nitrification process 3 2 treatment efficiency 3 2 1 cod removal the average initial cod concentration in cw mfcs was 353 54 1 mg l and the average cod removal was above 94 in all 4 phases with a slight difference based on aeration regimes the best result was observed in the system with high aeration rates ca i resulting in 97 4 1 6 cod removal under hrt of 50 8 h while in the ca ii cell cod removal slightly dropped to 94 1 4 9 to further understand the main processes involved in cod removal cod concentration was also measured along the cw mfc depth in different sampling points including s2 s3 and s4 indicated in fig 1 located respectively at 180 300 and 400 mm distances from the bottom of the reactor the results are shown in fig 3 it can be clearly seen that all the cells operated under different aeration regimes experienced a significant cod reduction in the anode layer on average between 66 and 71 of influent cod was removed in the anode zone in which electrogenic microorganisms degrade organic matter as the carbon source for supporting bacterial activity and producing electrons the remaining organic substrate was further removed in the upper layers of cw mfc under the activity of aerobic bacteria however no evidence of excess aeration effect on cod removal was detected in this work and the reactors with and without additional aeration showed similar behaviour in terms of cod removal in different layers the cod result obtained in this study was comparable with that of ji et al 19 s work in which a cod removal of over 90 was achieved in an unplanted cw mfc under the hrt of 3 days with different air cathode materials it can be concluded that the cod removal in the cw mfc system is mostly attributed to the activity of heterotrophic bacteria which degrade organic matter as a carbon source for their metabolism and hence the overall cod removal doesn t show a significant difference by changing the bioelectrochemical condition in the cell in the present study the low do concentration of the influent relatively large distance between anode and cathode layers and type and size of the media around the electrodes could provide a suitable environment for maximum growth and activity of the anaerobic bacteria 3 2 2 nitrogen removal nitrogen removal from wastewater effluent in a cw mfc can be accomplished by several processes such as plant uptake biodegradation anammox or classic nitrification denitrification routes physicochemical process participation in cathodic reduction reaction and electrode dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation process among these the so called classic routes of biodegradation processes such as ammonification nitrification and denitrification have been considered to be dominant processes which are directly affected by do level 49 the nutrient removal results are indicated in fig 4 measurements showed that more than 96 tkn removal and 100 nh3 removal in cw mfc with a continuous aeration regime which was much higher than nh3 removal rates in other similar studies with no aeration reported values are less than 50 50 51 it can be concluded that the do is a critical factor governing the nitrification process and hence ammonia removal was significantly improved in cells with continuous aeration however the relatively low tn removal in the continuous aeration regime 31 7 in ca i and 44 8 in ca ii indicated that high total nitrogen removal could not be achieved yet due to the incomplete denitrification process in the presence of supplementary aeration under intermittent aeration though effluent tn concentration dropped from 48 8 0 51 mg l to 18 4 0 14 mg l resulting in the total tn removal of 62 3 while the maximum nh3 removal was 64 8 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were also measured to further understand the efficiency of the system in terms of nitrogen removal the initial concentration of nitrate and nitrite in the influent was less than 0 1 mg l according to the results obtained an increase in nitrate concentration was observed in treated effluent while nitrite concentration remained less than 0 1 mg l under all experimental conditions showing that nitrite produced throughout nitrification denitrification processes was denitrified once produced similar results were also observed in the study conducted by li et al 29 because the nitritation rate was much faster than the nitration rate incomplete denitrification and hence accumulation of nitrate in the effluent of cw mfc has also been reported in several cw or cw mfc studies and it makes nitrate removal in cw mfc a challenging issue 52 however operating the cw mfc under intermittent aeration showed less nitrate accumulation in the effluent accounting for only 2 81 mg l which could be ascribed to the existing do profile in the cell under an intermittent aeration regime the do and nutrient gradients along the cw mfc provide different microenvironments in the attached biofilms which can facilitate the denitrification process it is possible to remove the leftover nitrate by changing the rate and duration of aeration under the intermittent aeration regime but that was not examined in this study high nitrate accumulation in the effluent of the cw mfc under continuous aeration ca could be attributed to stable ph and high oxygen concentration by which the ammonia oxidizing bacteria were more active than denitrifier bacteria whereas in ia and na conditions prevailing anoxic anaerobic conditions provided a suitable environment for denitrification process these results are well supported by those reported by wang et al 25 who investigated the effect of cathode do concentration on cod tn and nh3 removal with increasing do from 1 to 3 mg l their findings showed that cod and nh3 removal improved at the higher aeration rate but the maximum tn removal had a peak at a do concentration of 1 5 mg l and it dropped significantly afterwards the nitrate concentration was not analyzed in their study though overall it can be concluded that an excessive oxygen supply a deficient carbon source and a deficient nitrate source can limit the denitrification process in cw mfcs 34 one other possible pathway for nitrate removal in the cw mfc under intermittent aeration conditions is nitrate participation in the reduction reaction 53 this can only happen when the oxygen concentration is not enough to supply sufficient electron acceptors in the cathodic area several researchers have considered the reduction reaction of nitrate as the electron acceptor in the cathode zone as an explanation for high nitrate removal in their systems 54 for example wang et al 54 reported 81 nitrate removal in a similar cw mfc system fed with synthetic wastewater with an olr of 75 3 gcod m 3 d 1 and a c n ratio of 10 it was stated that high nitrate removal in the system was because redox potentials of nitrate and oxygen are very close to each other and hence both could be simultaneously used as electron acceptors 3 3 bioenergy generation 3 3 1 voltage profile and coulombic efficiency following the stable and reproducible performance that was obtained after 7 weeks the cell was operated under a continuous wastewater flow mode for 8 months under 4 different aeration conditions each with a duration of 2 months the voltage of cw mfcs under each aeration condition is plotted in fig 5 after changing the aeration condition in each phase of the study it took about 20 days to achieve stable bioelectricity performance presumed due to the time taken for the electrogenic bacteria to adjust to the new electrochemical condition according to the obtained results cw mfc operated under the intermittent aeration regime yielded the highest voltage of 0 450 v closely followed by the cells under the continuous aeration regime which amounted to 0 426 v ca ii and 0 419 v ca i the cell with no aeration could only achieve an output voltage of 0 355 v it should be noted that the bioelectricity production of the cell under ia condition had a minor fluctuation within a day achieving the maximum daily voltage 30 mv increment in about 2 to 4 h after starting the aeration and then reducing back to the initial voltage value throughout the day the larger voltage fluctuation observed during the last 10 days of the ia regime was due to the feeding pump malfunctioning the cw mfc performance during this period was not included in the average reported results the average voltage data along with other bioelectrochemical parameters are summarized in table 2 it is clearly shown that the performance of bioelectricity production was higher in the presence of supplementary aeration due to the availability of oxygen and accelerated electron transfer reactions similarly previous studies have demonstrated that enhancing oxygen concentration in the cathodic zone using algae assisted cw mfc 55 and tidal flow 17 increases electron utilisation for cathodic reduction reactions and promotes bioelectricity generation the low voltage output of the system without aeration na can be attributed to the participation of nitrate instead of oxygen in the redox reaction which will result in a lower output voltage as discussed in section 3 2 2 these results are in accordance with puig et al 56 who reported a direct nitrate reduction on the cathode electrode 3 3 2 power output and internal resistance polarization and voltage curves provide a powerful tool that not only shows the best resistance under which the maximum electrical power is achievable but also gives a better understanding of prominent electron transfer losses within the system 46 in the present work the cw mfc was operated under open circuit conditions for the first 7 weeks to achieve stable voltage output and then the polarization and power curves were plotted according to watson and logan 57 using a variable resistor box to calculate internal resistances the results are depicted in fig 6 it can be clearly seen that all cells studied followed the classical trend of decreasing output voltage with reducing external resistance the polarization curve started with a sharp drop of voltage in the low current region representing activation losses followed by a slow decrease of voltage in the middle current region representing the ohmic losses and finally a rapid voltage drop in the high current region denoting concentration losses from fig 6a it can be seen that major current losses under different aeration regimes happened due to ohmic losses furthermore the non aerated cw mfc seems to have higher activation and ohmic losses compared to the aerated cells in cells with supplementary aeration the availability of oxygen in the cathode layer results in higher reduction reaction potential lowering the activation overpotential the ohmic losses internal resistance in this study were measured by the polarization slope method by referring to the linear part of the polarization curve in a mid stage slow voltage drop fig 6a the internal resistance of the cells under different aeration regimes amounted to 280 ω ia 283 ω ca ii 292 ω ca i and 356 ω na the corresponding maximum power density was 7 5 mw m2 or 150 mw m3 ia 6 72 mw m2 or 134 mw m3 ca ii 6 04 mw m2 or 121 mw m3 ca i and 3 36 mw m2 or 67 2 mw m3 na reported per m2 of anode surface and m3 of anode volume respectively fig 6b reveals that the maximum power output of the systems with intermittent aeration was more than twice that of non aerated systems the existence of supplementary aeration in the upper layer of cw mfc may lessen the activation and ohmic losses by providing the electron acceptor oxygen requirements thus improving the power density of the cell there are no similar works to compare the power output of aerated cells but the power densities obtained in the non aerated cell were slightly less than the previously reported works 58 for example liu et al 58 reported a maximum power density of 55 1 mw m2 under external resistance of 156 ω with an electrode distance of 17 cm in cw mfc planted with ipomoea aquatica the higher power output in liu s study could be due to the lower electrode distance the presence of the plant and the lower external resistance applied to the cell similarly in a study on the effect of external resistance on mfc performance conducted by jung and regan 28 lower external resistance 150 ω contributed to higher power output and less methane production broadly the power potential of cw mfc can be defined as normalized energy recovery ner to eliminate the dependency of power output on the size and volume of the cell 7 the ner in the present study is expressed in two common units of i whm 3 which is power generated w divided by wastewater flowrate m3 h 1 known as nerv and ii wh kgcod 1 which is power generated divided by organic matter removal rate kg cod h 1 known as ners fig 7 depicts a comparison of the energy recovery and power output of the present study with earlier findings the results showed that the maximum energy recovery was achieved in the system with intermittent aeration accounting for 1 4 wh per m3 of treated wastewater or 4 13 wh per kg cod removed in addition the maximum nerv in cells with supplementary aeration was higher than that of non aerated cells in this work and other previously reported non aerated cw mfcs 20 26 49 59 it can be due to increased power output resulting from better reduction reactions in the cathode layer table 2 summarizes cw mfc performance in terms of energy generation the coulombic efficiency ce for systems under different aeration regimes were 1 95 ia 1 75 ca ii 1 53 ca i and 1 21 na these results are in accord with the other reported studies with the average ce values in the range of 0 1 to 8 in planted and unplanted cells 7 59 however a study conducted by xie et al 26 showed that plant growth in cw mfc can enhance coulombic efficiency by 16 4 the low ce can be attributed to the fact that organic matter degradation is not associated with electron generation it is a common issue in cw mfc technology in which electrons are wasted by methanogenic and aerobic respiration bacteria instead of electrogenic bacteria the result of this study also indicated that different rates of aeration don t have a significant effect on ce values a comparison of the findings with those of other studies also confirms that the ce value depends on various factors such as initial cod concentration electrode distance inoculum source characteristics and the ratio of the electrode surface area to the total volume of the cell 7 4 conclusion the power generation and nutrient removal performance of cw mfc under different rates of aeration was systematically investigated in this study the findings showed that intermittent aeration could effectively improve nitrogen removal in cw mfc compared to the non aerated and continuously aerated system the cw mfc studied achieved more than 96 8 cod and 62 3 tn removal along with 7 50 mw m2 power generation under an intermittent aeration regime it was also found that higher do in the cathodic area was beneficial for power generation but it hindered the denitrification process and hence resulted in nitrate accumulation in the system although under the continuously aerated regimes the cw mfc could reach the highest nitrification rate the denitrification process was markedly hindered because of an excessive oxygen supply overall intermittent aeration is a suitable choice to be used in cw mfcs for efficient septic tank effluent treatment however further studies with more focus on the effect of duration and intensity of aeration on the nitrate removal process are required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12556,this study examines the effect of different rates and modes of supplementary aeration on the treatment of synthetic septic tank effluent in a lab scale unplanted constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc along with bioenergy generation the experiment was conducted in 4 sequential phases 1 the cell was operated with no aeration na 2 3 the cathode layer was continuously aerated under different aeration rates ca i and ca ii and 4 the cathode layer was intermittently aerated ia results showed that the dissolved oxygen gradient caused by ia formed aerobic and anoxic zones in cw mfc and promoted total nitrogen removal the best performance was observed with intermittent aeration where the maximum removal efficiencies of cod 96 8 3 3 tn 62 3 2 1 tkn 68 3 2 0 and nh3 64 8 2 3 were achieved furthermore this treatment efficiency corresponded with enhanced bioenergy generation under the ia regime achieving maximum power output 7 5 mw m2 highest average voltage output 0 399 0 02 v coulombic efficiency 1 94 and normalized energy recovery 1 4 wh m3 continuous aeration however induced an adverse effect on energy generation due to excessive oxygen penetration into the anode region nitrate accumulation was also observed as a sign of an incomplete denitrification process under the continuous aeration regime overall it can be concluded that the intermittently aerated cw mfc not only lowers operational costs but improves effectiveness in terms of the nitrogen removal process in the treatment of septic tank effluent keywords supplementary aeration septic tank effluent constructed wetland microbial fuel cell energy recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction septic tanks have been widely used as a cost effective onsite primary treatment for domestic wastewater in peri urban and rural areas however septic tank effluent ste still has a high content of suspended solids chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen which requires an appropriate post treatment technology 1 research to date has worked on numerous treatment technologies for further polishing treatment of ste such as constructed wetlands 2 3 circulating fluidized bed bioreactors cfbbr 4 moving bed biological reactors mbbr 5 photobioreactors 6 and microbial desalination cells 1 the cost and energy associated with these technologies along with complications in the treatment processes and environmental concerns adversely impact their effectiveness as sustainable technologies for ste treatment among the technologies however constructed wetlands cws stand out as a nature inspired technology having lower operation and maintenance costs and energy usage while cw offers a reliable and sustainable treatment process they do still present some intrinsic challenges for wastewater treatment such as insufficient treatment efficiency of nutrients and greenhouse gas emissions 7 these challenges have limited the application of this technology to work as an efficient secondary treatment process to overcome the limitations of cw technology and to provide additional benefits a merger of cw and microbial fuel cell mfc technologies into a so called cw mfc process has emerged mfc is an innovative bioelectrochemical approach for naturally converting waste into energy through the metabolic activity of electrogenic bacteria 8 recently there has been a growing trend toward fruitful commercialization and scaling up of fuel cell based technologies 9 novel bioelectrochemical systems such as mfcs microbial electrolysis cells mecs 10 11 and microbial desalination cells mdcs 12 work as versatile technologies providing bioenergy 9 along with feedstock treatment 13 nutrient removal 14 resource recovery 15 and biosensing potential 16 from these a combination of mfc with cw is seen as most likely to yield significant benefits the advantages of an integrated cw mfc compared with individual cw and mfc processes have been comprehensively investigated by ebrahimi et al 7 the findings have shown the greater practical value of an integrated system possessing superior sustainability performance with lower greenhouse gas emissions and superior treatment efficiency energy generation is also promoted as an additional advantage of integrated systems with many potential uses such as monitoring wetland health without external power input mfc based technology such as cw mfc needs an oxic anoxic environment for the anaerobic oxidation of organic matter and releasing electrons and the aerobic zone to complete the reduction reaction of released electrons the main difference between a traditional cw mfc and a mfc is utilizing the stratified redox gradient which naturally exists along a cw column due to the presence of an anaerobic region near the bottom of a cw and an aerobic region adjacent to the air water interface 17 nevertheless both systems utilize the chemical energy accumulated in organic matter molecules through the catalytic activity of anode respiring bacteria to generate electrical energy 7 during recent years there has been a growing body of literature that recognises the importance of design and operational parameters in improving the performance of cw mfc systems investigating both planted 18 and unplanted 19 cells it is now well established that the optimum efficiency of cw mfc systems depends on numerous design variables such as reactor configuration 20 substrate characteristics 21 22 the electrode material used in the reactor 23 24 operational conditions 25 26 etc these variables directly affect key operating parameters of cw mfcs such as oxidation reduction potential 27 internal external resistance 28 oxygen demand 29 anode bacterial activity 23 30 and contaminant removal 25 a comprehensive taxonomy of effective construction and operational variables in cw mfc performance has been identified by ebrahimi et al 31 it has been clearly shown that despite achieving promising results in wastewater treatment using cw mfc so far these systems have not reached their potential being unable to go further than the pilot scale using oxygen as the main electron acceptor in the cathode layer is among the most convenient strategy for developing cw mfc systems oxygen has a high redox potential compared to the other electron acceptors and it can be directly provided by exposing the cathode electrode to the air 32 however the natural oxygen supply from the air might not be sufficient to meet reaction demand additional oxygen can be easily supplied into cw mfc by various low cost strategies such as bubbling air in the water tidal flow feeding air pipes frequent water level fluctuation and passive aeration pumps 33 providing supplementary aeration in the cathodic area can improve cw mfc efficiency through several mechanisms the supplementary aeration enhances electricity generation in mfc based technologies primarily due to the high redox potential of oxygen it will also provide several advantages to cw systems 29 for example enhancing oxygen availability can improve mineralization and decrease clogging resulting from biofilm formation in upper layers 34 35 artificial aeration can also be very helpful during cold weather when plants are dormant and cannot provide adequate oxygen 36 finally according to previous studies aerated cws can surpass non aerated systems in terms of nitrogen removal 35 37 however despite its clear advantages little knowledge is available in the literature about the effect of different rates of aeration on nitrogen removal and power generation in cw mfcs hence the main focus of this work is to study oxygen supplementation in the cw mfc process as the main limiting factor in cw mfc performance therefore the treatability of specific tank effluent with a c n ratio of 8 has been examined under different aeration regimes at the cathode area in order to assess the overall performance of a cw mfc fed with septic tank effluent a number of critical treatment parameters cod tn tkn no3 and nh4 removal and operational parameters voltage output power density current density energy recovery and coulombic efficiency were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 septic tank effluent characteristics the ste characteristics generally depend on several designs and operational factors such as septic tank depth hydraulic retention time temperature organic and hydraulic loading rates etc the synthetic ste wastewater used in this study is composed of glucose 225 mg l yeast extract 37 5 mg l dried milk 150 mg l urea 37 5 mg l nh4cl 75 na2hpo4 12h2o 125 mg l khco3 62 5 mg l nahco3 162 5 mg l mgso4 7h2o 62 5 mg l feso4 h2o 2 5 mg l and cacl2 6h2o 0 5 mg l the wastewater composition was chosen to provide the typical average characteristics of septic tank effluent table 1 depicts the typical characteristics of ste used in this study and those extracted from different sources 2 2 cw mfc construction the images of the lab scale cw mfc used in this study and a schematic are shown in fig 1 the system was constructed using plexiglass sheets with an internal square section of 200 mm by 200 mm and a height of 480 mm the net liquid volume of cw mfc was 6 1 l the bed media from the bottom to the top consisted of 165 mm of gravel with a particle size of 10 12 mm as the support layer 50 mm of granular activated carbon gac with a particle size of 2 36 4 75 mm as anode layer 130 mm of gravel with the particle size of 3 5 mm as the middle layer and 50 mm of gac with a particle size of 2 36 4 75 mm as the cathode layer all filter media were washed and cleaned before use in cw mfc the coarse gravel used in the triangular section located at the bottom of cw mfc helped in the uniform distribution of wastewater influent upward into the cell four sampling ports were installed at specified locations s1 s2 s3 and s4 with 20 180 300 and 400 mm distances from the bottom of the cw mfc module as shown in fig 1 the stainless steel plates ssps with uniform 10 mm holes were used for both anode 170 170 mm and cathode 190 190 mm electrodes two additional holes each having a 60 mm diameter were incorporated into the cathode electrode allowing for plant placement while giving the same effective surface area of 0 0224 m2 for both anode and cathode electrodes the cathode electrode was placed in the soil water interface 15 mm under the wastewater surface while the anode electrode was placed 185 mm from the bottom the distance between electrodes was kept at 205 mm to increase the electron attachment and electrical conductivity both electrodes were placed within a layer of granular activated carbon gac with a height of 50 mm gac was employed to form the composite electrode because of its compatibility with electrogenic bacteria and low cost 41 electrodes were connected to an external resistance rext of 1000 ω using insulated copper wires applying an optimum rext is important as it affects both treatment efficiency and maximum power output high rext results in lowering current output limited microbial activity and likely less treatment efficiency while low external resistance directly reduces output voltage 28 31 comparability of the results with the other research studies was also another factor in decision making regarding external resistance considering all these three factors an external resistance of 1000 ω was selected and kept unchanged throughout the study 2 3 cw mfc inoculation and start up before starting the experiments ssp electrodes were soaked in 0 1 m hcl and subsequently 0 1 m naoh for 24 h and then they were rinsed with deionized water to eliminate any oil contamination concentrated anaerobic sludge collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wollongong nsw australia was used to inoculate the anode layer of cw mfc two mature plants dwarf papyrus with an average stem height of 300 mm and root length of 40 mm were transplanted into the top layer cathode zone of the cw mfc papyrus has been used successfully in different cw mfc systems showing high tolerance to nutrient rich wastewater 42 the cw mfc cell was acclimatized for nearly 7 weeks with synthetic wastewater until full enrichment of the anode electrode and reaching a stable voltage 43 synthetic wastewater was fed continuously by a peristaltic pump to the cw mfc at a flow rate of 2 ml min with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 50 8 h to ensure bacterial growth plants used in this study went gradually through wilting yellowing and curling of the leaves and they eventually died the dead plant biomass was removed from the cell before starting the cw mfc operation and cw mfc in this study was hence considered an unplanted cell gradual plant acclimatization to the high nutrient content wastewater before transplanting them into cw mfc may have prevented plant death 2 4 cw mfc operation during operation synthetic wastewater was continuously fed into the bottom of the cell using a peristaltic pump providing a constant organic loading rate olr of 28 8 g cod m 2 day 1 188 9 g cod m 3 day 1 with the wastewater moving upward to the cathode compartment the performance of cw mfc was analyzed under four sequential phases in this study 1 na in which the system was operated with no aeration 2 ca i the cathode layer was continuously aerated with an aeration rate of 6 lpm 3 ca ii the cathode layer was continuously aerated with an aeration rate of 3 lpm and 4 ia in which the cathode layer was intermittently aerated where aeration was applied for 2 h a day at a flow rate of 3 lpm starting at 8 00 am for the remaining 22 h of the day no aeration was applied three aeration spargers connected to an aquarium air pump aqua one air pump 12 000 were fixed at the cathode layer 30 mm below the wastewater free surface to supply air into the cathode area airflow during the intermittent aeration phase was controlled by an automatic on off timer the system was operated at room temperature 20 22 c for 290 days in this study 2 5 sample collection and analysis this study consisted of 4 sequential sets of experiments to evaluate the aeration effect in cw mfc each set lasted for two months the effluent samples were collected twice a week during cw mfc operation and all water samples were tested in triplicates cod and nutrient concentration were measured by uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 3900 according to the standard method 44 do and ph were measured using a do meter professional plus ysi n959 and a ph meter thermo scientific orion respectively cell voltages produced by cw mfc were recorded every 15 min using a data acquisition system ni 9208 the current was calculated using ohm s law i u r where u is the measured voltage v and rext is the external resistance ω the current and power were normalized by the projected surface area of the anode electrode to obtain the current and power density normalized energy recovery was also calculated based on the equations described in ebrahimi et al 7 coulombic efficiency ce was calculated by integrating the current measured over time relative to the maximum theoretical current which can be achieved by substrate degradation in the system eq 1 ce shows the efficiency by which electrons are transferred within the system to complete electrochemical reactions 45 1 ce m 0 t it fb cv 100 where

do performs a crucial role in the microbial activity in cw mfc hence the aerobic and anaerobic conditions of the cw mfc were assessed by monitoring do concentration during working hours from 8 00 am to 6 00 pm fig 2 indicates the full profile of do within the cw mfc column during na and ca modes showing wide ranging variation through the depth of the cw column fig 2a given that unlike the other regimes do values varied constantly throughout the day in ia the do variation under ia condition is shown in fig 2b the anaerobic anoxic environment was established on the anode layer at 180 mm from the bottom while the aerobic environment was observed above the reactor the do concentration varied in the range of 1 25 to 8 09 mg l under ca i 6 lpm regime 0 91 to 6 22 mg l under ca ii 3lpm regime and 0 57 to 2 07 mg l under the no aeration regime na within cw mfc column the low do level at the bottom of the reactor anode region indicated that the anode layer was a reductive environment which enabled organic matter degradation by anaerobic bacteria and produced electrons while increasing the do level in the cathode layer using external aeration could enhance heterotrophic microorganisms activity without lowering denitrification a similar do profile was also reported by oon et al 46 daily do measurement under the ia regime fig 2b showed that do quickly increased to peak values an average do of 8 36 mg l in the cathode layer when aeration was commenced and then was gradually depleted to a do concentration of 1 14 mg l over time when aeration was stopped therefore aerobic and anaerobic zones could be simultaneously present due to the stratification of biofilms under an intermittent aeration regime other studies have also shown the existence of micro aerobic anaerobic regions and biofilm stratification with intermittent aeration in cw 34 47 ph analysis showed that cw mfc under all operational conditions had a weak alkaline effluent with a ph value in the range of 6 81 7 63 in non aerated cw mfc and 7 15 to 7 91 in the aerated system these results reflect those of gonzalez et al 48 who also reported an effluent ph in the range of 6 91 to 7 59 in a non aerated unplanted cw mfc it should be noted that ph in aerated systems was slightly higher and more stable than in non aerated systems providing optimal conditions for the nitrification process 3 2 treatment efficiency 3 2 1 cod removal the average initial cod concentration in cw mfcs was 353 54 1 mg l and the average cod removal was above 94 in all 4 phases with a slight difference based on aeration regimes the best result was observed in the system with high aeration rates ca i resulting in 97 4 1 6 cod removal under hrt of 50 8 h while in the ca ii cell cod removal slightly dropped to 94 1 4 9 to further understand the main processes involved in cod removal cod concentration was also measured along the cw mfc depth in different sampling points including s2 s3 and s4 indicated in fig 1 located respectively at 180 300 and 400 mm distances from the bottom of the reactor the results are shown in fig 3 it can be clearly seen that all the cells operated under different aeration regimes experienced a significant cod reduction in the anode layer on average between 66 and 71 of influent cod was removed in the anode zone in which electrogenic microorganisms degrade organic matter as the carbon source for supporting bacterial activity and producing electrons the remaining organic substrate was further removed in the upper layers of cw mfc under the activity of aerobic bacteria however no evidence of excess aeration effect on cod removal was detected in this work and the reactors with and without additional aeration showed similar behaviour in terms of cod removal in different layers the cod result obtained in this study was comparable with that of ji et al 19 s work in which a cod removal of over 90 was achieved in an unplanted cw mfc under the hrt of 3 days with different air cathode materials it can be concluded that the cod removal in the cw mfc system is mostly attributed to the activity of heterotrophic bacteria which degrade organic matter as a carbon source for their metabolism and hence the overall cod removal doesn t show a significant difference by changing the bioelectrochemical condition in the cell in the present study the low do concentration of the influent relatively large distance between anode and cathode layers and type and size of the media around the electrodes could provide a suitable environment for maximum growth and activity of the anaerobic bacteria 3 2 2 nitrogen removal nitrogen removal from wastewater effluent in a cw mfc can be accomplished by several processes such as plant uptake biodegradation anammox or classic nitrification denitrification routes physicochemical process participation in cathodic reduction reaction and electrode dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation process among these the so called classic routes of biodegradation processes such as ammonification nitrification and denitrification have been considered to be dominant processes which are directly affected by do level 49 the nutrient removal results are indicated in fig 4 measurements showed that more than 96 tkn removal and 100 nh3 removal in cw mfc with a continuous aeration regime which was much higher than nh3 removal rates in other similar studies with no aeration reported values are less than 50 50 51 it can be concluded that the do is a critical factor governing the nitrification process and hence ammonia removal was significantly improved in cells with continuous aeration however the relatively low tn removal in the continuous aeration regime 31 7 in ca i and 44 8 in ca ii indicated that high total nitrogen removal could not be achieved yet due to the incomplete denitrification process in the presence of supplementary aeration under intermittent aeration though effluent tn concentration dropped from 48 8 0 51 mg l to 18 4 0 14 mg l resulting in the total tn removal of 62 3 while the maximum nh3 removal was 64 8 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were also measured to further understand the efficiency of the system in terms of nitrogen removal the initial concentration of nitrate and nitrite in the influent was less than 0 1 mg l according to the results obtained an increase in nitrate concentration was observed in treated effluent while nitrite concentration remained less than 0 1 mg l under all experimental conditions showing that nitrite produced throughout nitrification denitrification processes was denitrified once produced similar results were also observed in the study conducted by li et al 29 because the nitritation rate was much faster than the nitration rate incomplete denitrification and hence accumulation of nitrate in the effluent of cw mfc has also been reported in several cw or cw mfc studies and it makes nitrate removal in cw mfc a challenging issue 52 however operating the cw mfc under intermittent aeration showed less nitrate accumulation in the effluent accounting for only 2 81 mg l which could be ascribed to the existing do profile in the cell under an intermittent aeration regime the do and nutrient gradients along the cw mfc provide different microenvironments in the attached biofilms which can facilitate the denitrification process it is possible to remove the leftover nitrate by changing the rate and duration of aeration under the intermittent aeration regime but that was not examined in this study high nitrate accumulation in the effluent of the cw mfc under continuous aeration ca could be attributed to stable ph and high oxygen concentration by which the ammonia oxidizing bacteria were more active than denitrifier bacteria whereas in ia and na conditions prevailing anoxic anaerobic conditions provided a suitable environment for denitrification process these results are well supported by those reported by wang et al 25 who investigated the effect of cathode do concentration on cod tn and nh3 removal with increasing do from 1 to 3 mg l their findings showed that cod and nh3 removal improved at the higher aeration rate but the maximum tn removal had a peak at a do concentration of 1 5 mg l and it dropped significantly afterwards the nitrate concentration was not analyzed in their study though overall it can be concluded that an excessive oxygen supply a deficient carbon source and a deficient nitrate source can limit the denitrification process in cw mfcs 34 one other possible pathway for nitrate removal in the cw mfc under intermittent aeration conditions is nitrate participation in the reduction reaction 53 this can only happen when the oxygen concentration is not enough to supply sufficient electron acceptors in the cathodic area several researchers have considered the reduction reaction of nitrate as the electron acceptor in the cathode zone as an explanation for high nitrate removal in their systems 54 for example wang et al 54 reported 81 nitrate removal in a similar cw mfc system fed with synthetic wastewater with an olr of 75 3 gcod m 3 d 1 and a c n ratio of 10 it was stated that high nitrate removal in the system was because redox potentials of nitrate and oxygen are very close to each other and hence both could be simultaneously used as electron acceptors 3 3 bioenergy generation 3 3 1 voltage profile and coulombic efficiency following the stable and reproducible performance that was obtained after 7 weeks the cell was operated under a continuous wastewater flow mode for 8 months under 4 different aeration conditions each with a duration of 2 months the voltage of cw mfcs under each aeration condition is plotted in fig 5 after changing the aeration condition in each phase of the study it took about 20 days to achieve stable bioelectricity performance presumed due to the time taken for the electrogenic bacteria to adjust to the new electrochemical condition according to the obtained results cw mfc operated under the intermittent aeration regime yielded the highest voltage of 0 450 v closely followed by the cells under the continuous aeration regime which amounted to 0 426 v ca ii and 0 419 v ca i the cell with no aeration could only achieve an output voltage of 0 355 v it should be noted that the bioelectricity production of the cell under ia condition had a minor fluctuation within a day achieving the maximum daily voltage 30 mv increment in about 2 to 4 h after starting the aeration and then reducing back to the initial voltage value throughout the day the larger voltage fluctuation observed during the last 10 days of the ia regime was due to the feeding pump malfunctioning the cw mfc performance during this period was not included in the average reported results the average voltage data along with other bioelectrochemical parameters are summarized in table 2 it is clearly shown that the performance of bioelectricity production was higher in the presence of supplementary aeration due to the availability of oxygen and accelerated electron transfer reactions similarly previous studies have demonstrated that enhancing oxygen concentration in the cathodic zone using algae assisted cw mfc 55 and tidal flow 17 increases electron utilisation for cathodic reduction reactions and promotes bioelectricity generation the low voltage output of the system without aeration na can be attributed to the participation of nitrate instead of oxygen in the redox reaction which will result in a lower output voltage as discussed in section 3 2 2 these results are in accordance with puig et al 56 who reported a direct nitrate reduction on the cathode electrode 3 3 2 power output and internal resistance polarization and voltage curves provide a powerful tool that not only shows the best resistance under which the maximum electrical power is achievable but also gives a better understanding of prominent electron transfer losses within the system 46 in the present work the cw mfc was operated under open circuit conditions for the first 7 weeks to achieve stable voltage output and then the polarization and power curves were plotted according to watson and logan 57 using a variable resistor box to calculate internal resistances the results are depicted in fig 6 it can be clearly seen that all cells studied followed the classical trend of decreasing output voltage with reducing external resistance the polarization curve started with a sharp drop of voltage in the low current region representing activation losses followed by a slow decrease of voltage in the middle current region representing the ohmic losses and finally a rapid voltage drop in the high current region denoting concentration losses from fig 6a it can be seen that major current losses under different aeration regimes happened due to ohmic losses furthermore the non aerated cw mfc seems to have higher activation and ohmic losses compared to the aerated cells in cells with supplementary aeration the availability of oxygen in the cathode layer results in higher reduction reaction potential lowering the activation overpotential the ohmic losses internal resistance in this study were measured by the polarization slope method by referring to the linear part of the polarization curve in a mid stage slow voltage drop fig 6a the internal resistance of the cells under different aeration regimes amounted to 280 ω ia 283 ω ca ii 292 ω ca i and 356 ω na the corresponding maximum power density was 7 5 mw m2 or 150 mw m3 ia 6 72 mw m2 or 134 mw m3 ca ii 6 04 mw m2 or 121 mw m3 ca i and 3 36 mw m2 or 67 2 mw m3 na reported per m2 of anode surface and m3 of anode volume respectively fig 6b reveals that the maximum power output of the systems with intermittent aeration was more than twice that of non aerated systems the existence of supplementary aeration in the upper layer of cw mfc may lessen the activation and ohmic losses by providing the electron acceptor oxygen requirements thus improving the power density of the cell there are no similar works to compare the power output of aerated cells but the power densities obtained in the non aerated cell were slightly less than the previously reported works 58 for example liu et al 58 reported a maximum power density of 55 1 mw m2 under external resistance of 156 ω with an electrode distance of 17 cm in cw mfc planted with ipomoea aquatica the higher power output in liu s study could be due to the lower electrode distance the presence of the plant and the lower external resistance applied to the cell similarly in a study on the effect of external resistance on mfc performance conducted by jung and regan 28 lower external resistance 150 ω contributed to higher power output and less methane production broadly the power potential of cw mfc can be defined as normalized energy recovery ner to eliminate the dependency of power output on the size and volume of the cell 7 the ner in the present study is expressed in two common units of i whm 3 which is power generated w divided by wastewater flowrate m3 h 1 known as nerv and ii wh kgcod 1 which is power generated divided by organic matter removal rate kg cod h 1 known as ners fig 7 depicts a comparison of the energy recovery and power output of the present study with earlier findings the results showed that the maximum energy recovery was achieved in the system with intermittent aeration accounting for 1 4 wh per m3 of treated wastewater or 4 13 wh per kg cod removed in addition the maximum nerv in cells with supplementary aeration was higher than that of non aerated cells in this work and other previously reported non aerated cw mfcs 20 26 49 59 it can be due to increased power output resulting from better reduction reactions in the cathode layer table 2 summarizes cw mfc performance in terms of energy generation the coulombic efficiency ce for systems under different aeration regimes were 1 95 ia 1 75 ca ii 1 53 ca i and 1 21 na these results are in accord with the other reported studies with the average ce values in the range of 0 1 to 8 in planted and unplanted cells 7 59 however a study conducted by xie et al 26 showed that plant growth in cw mfc can enhance coulombic efficiency by 16 4 the low ce can be attributed to the fact that organic matter degradation is not associated with electron generation it is a common issue in cw mfc technology in which electrons are wasted by methanogenic and aerobic respiration bacteria instead of electrogenic bacteria the result of this study also indicated that different rates of aeration don t have a significant effect on ce values a comparison of the findings with those of other studies also confirms that the ce value depends on various factors such as initial cod concentration electrode distance inoculum source characteristics and the ratio of the electrode surface area to the total volume of the cell 7 4 conclusion the power generation and nutrient removal performance of cw mfc under different rates of aeration was systematically investigated in this study the findings showed that intermittent aeration could effectively improve nitrogen removal in cw mfc compared to the non aerated and continuously aerated system the cw mfc studied achieved more than 96 8 cod and 62 3 tn removal along with 7 50 mw m2 power generation under an intermittent aeration regime it was also found that higher do in the cathodic area was beneficial for power generation but it hindered the denitrification process and hence resulted in nitrate accumulation in the system although under the continuously aerated regimes the cw mfc could reach the highest nitrification rate the denitrification process was markedly hindered because of an excessive oxygen supply overall intermittent aeration is a suitable choice to be used in cw mfcs for efficient septic tank effluent treatment however further studies with more focus on the effect of duration and intensity of aeration on the nitrate removal process are required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12557,graphene oxide go doped with heteroatoms are gaining interest in depollution of water because of their large surface area this paper presents for the first time the comparative adsorptive properties of boron and phosphorous doped go b go and p go to remove pb ii and as iii ions from water the doped go were synthesized by two step approach and fully characterized using various analytical techniques to demonstrate their distinct structural and adsorptive features the brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas of b go 127 4 m2g 1 and p go 144 4 m2g 1 were higher than that of pristine go 77 4 m2g 1 due to insertion of dopants during synthesis the defects in the doped go were higher which were seen in measurements of band intensity ratio of defect band to graphene band in the raman spectra of b go p go and pristine go as 1 02 1 17 and 0 84 respectively the xps studies revealed that 96 9 po and 3 1 of pc moieties were present in p go whereas in b go 93 4 c2bo cbo2 and 6 3 bc moieties were present thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of adsorption of pb ii and as iii onto doped go and pristine go were determined under different experimental conditions of ph adsorbent dose and co existing ions results were interpreted using linear and non linear isotherms and kinetic modelling the langmuir binding capacities of p go were 388 1 mgg 1 and 157 4 mgg 1 for pb ii and as iii ions respectively which were higher than b go and pristine go higher adsorption capacity of p go was delineated on the basis of functional moieties surface defects smaller particle size and larger surface area the renewability experiment showed a negligible decrease in adsorption capacity of p go even after five repeated cycles column studies supported the applicability of p go as an effective adsorbent for removing metal ions in the continuous system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords doped graphene oxide boron and phosphorus doping pb ii and as iii removal adsorption mechanism kinetics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pollution caused by toxic heavy metal ions and metalloids is a matter of global concern the electroplating battery manufacturing industries and leaching from geological formations are the main sources of metal pollution 1 lead pb ii and arsenite as iii have attracted immense concern owing to their deleterious effect at low concentrations 2 3 the main sources of pb ii in the groundwater are lead pipes and plumbing fixtures 4 as iii in the form of lead arsenate copper arsenate is used in pesticides manufacturing industries from where it leaches and contaminate the ground water according to world health organization who guidelines the permissible limit of pb ii and as iii in water is 50 μg l 1 and 10 μg l 1 respectively 5 6 various approaches viz ion exchange chemical precipitation reverse osmosis oxidation reduction degradation adsorption and membrane filtration have been examined to remove these toxic metal ions from water 7 8 among these technologies adsorption is an attractive strategy because it is considered as a robust energy efficient and environmentally benign process 9 the current paper focuses on carbon based materials i e doped graphene oxide go as adsorbent go has rich adsorptive sites and large surface area as well as tunable structure having epoxy hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups on surface to remove noxious ions 10 13 however the layers of pristine go can irreversibly aggregate due to the existence of strong interplanar reciprocities which hinder the effective adsorptive performance 14 this limitation may be alleviated by modifying go in literature different approaches have been applied to increase the adsorptive properties of go that include the fabrication of nanocomposites or the insertion of heteroatoms in the go lattice the later approach improves the adsorption potential of go significantly by enhancing its local defects and mesoporosity 15 among the heteroatoms doped go most of adsorption studies have been performed using nitrogen doped go n go 16 17 currently no study is known in the literature on the applications of b go and p go as adsorbents for heavy metal ions and metalloids furthermore investigations using b go and p go are limited to inorganic compounds e g ammonia and organics e g oxytetracycline and dyes 15 18 20 the present studies are thus aimed to comparatively examine the adsorptive properties of b go and p go adsorption performance was examined using pb ii and as iii as model pollutants firstly the content of b and p was optimized in the doped go for maximum removal of these pollutants surface and analytical techniques were employed to seek the distinct differences between b go and p go higher adsorption potential of p go as compared to b go and go was explained on the basis of raman x ray photoelectron spectra xps thermodynamics adsorption isotherm and kinetic modelling effect of various influencing parameters viz ph adsorbent dose contact time co existing ions and temperature on pb ii and as iii removal using p go as adsorbent was studied results were interpreted using linear and non linear adsorption isotherms and kinetic modelling the studies were extended to estimate the efficiency of p go in the dynamic water system by conducting the column adsorption studies p go not only affords facile synthesis but also exhibits excellent adsorption capacity in the batch and column studies concentration time profile was predicted using thomas model 2 experimental methods all the chemicals viz graphite powder orthoboric acid h3bo3 orthophosphoric acid h3po4 sulphuric acid h2so4 hydrogen chloride hcl lead nitrate pb no3 2 4h2o sodium arsenite naaso2 sodium nitrate nano3 potassium permanganate kmno4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hydroxide naoh of analytical grade were procured from sd fine pvt ltd and used without further purification all the solutions were prepared in deionized water 2 1 synthesis of doped graphene oxide phosphorous doped graphene oxide p go from orthophosphoric acid with variable phosphorous dopant content from 1 0 to 30 0 w w part of phosphorous and go was synthesized in two steps in the first step graphene oxide go was synthesized using modified hummer s method 21 in the second step orthophosphoric acid and 150 ml of go aqueous suspension 3 3 mg ml 1 were mixed and stirred 150 rpm in a 150 ml of round bottom flask for 2 h under ambient conditions the obtained mixture was oven dried at 60 c overnight and then placed in a muffle furnace at 300 c for 3 h so that p dopant was covalently attached to the oxygenous functional groups of go and at that temperature orthophosphoric moiety was converted into its diphosphoric form the annealed powder was re dispersed in distilled water to form a suspension of p go the resulting product was sonicated for 6 h frequency of 90 khz power of 40 w to get layered structure the synthesized pgo was washed with hcl solution followed by distilled water to remove impurities of phosphorous oxide boron doped graphene oxide b go was also synthesized in the similar way using orthoboric acid as a boron containing source the details of instrumentation used for characterization of go b go and p go is given in supplementary text s1 2 2 batch adsorption experiments and statistical analysis stock solution of pb ii and as iii ions 100 mgl 1 was prepared by dissolving pb no3 4h2o and naaso2 in distilled water the first experiment was conducted to find out the best nanoadsorbent using 5 mgl 1 concentration of pb ii as iii ions 100 ml and 0 2 gl 1 of nanoadsorbents at 25 c then using the best nanoadsorbent i e p go further experiments were performed effect of ph 2 0 to 10 0 and temperature 10 to 55 c was studied using 0 4 gl 1 of p go in 100 ml solution of pb ii as iii ions 5 mgl 1 and the mixture was agitated for 2 h van t hoff equation was used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters supplementary text s2 the impact of adsorbent dose on pb ii and as iii ions each 5 mgl 1 adsorption was studied by varying the adsorbent dose from 0 04 to 6 0 gl 1 for isotherm experiments 0 4 gl 1 of p go with 100 ml of pb ii as iii ion solution with varied concentration 2 100 mgl 1 was agitated in an orbital shaker incubator for 2 h at optimum ph for adsorption kinetic studies 0 4 gl 1 of p go was added into 100 ml of pb ii as iii solution 5 mgl 1 and agitated up to 180 min at optimum ph after each experiment the samples were centrifugated and centrifugate was used to determine the concentration of analyte using inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectroscopy icap oes technique limits of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were also evaluated for pb ii and as iii ions as explained in supplementary data s1 all the batch experiments were conducted thrice and mean values are reported the adsorption efficiency ae and adsorption capacity qt of p go were calculated using the following eqs 1 and 2 22 1 adsorption effciency ae c i c t c i 100 2 adsorption capacity q t c i c t w v where ci ct v and w are the initial metal concentration mgl 1 concentration at time t volume of solution l and adsorbent dosage g respectively the zero point charge phzpc of samples was determined by plotting a graph between initial ph and δph phfinal phinitial the effect of solution ph on percent distribution of different forms of pb ii and as iii in solution was calculated using visual minteq software the impact of coexisting cations was studied in the quaternary system of pb ii cd ii zn ii and ni ii with 100 ml of 0 1 mm solution of metal ions and 0 4 gl 1 of nanoadsorbent at ph 6 0 25 c for 2 h whereas the influence of anions viz cl no3 2 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 ions having concentration ranging from 0 1 to 10 0 mm was studied using their sodium salts adsorption of pb ii and as iii ions each 100 ml of 0 1 mmoll 1 was investigated using 0 4 gl 1 of nanoadsorbent at 25 c for 2 h reusability studies were carried out using 0 2 g of p go in 100 ml of 5 mgl 1 pb ii and as iii solutions the prepared solutions were agitated for 2 h at 120 rpm at 25 c and centrifugates were analyzed to determine the concentration of pb ii as iii ions after that the spent nanoadsorbent was collected dispersed and then regenerated with 0 1 m hcl the treated nanoadsorbent was used for next adsorption experiment further to evaluate the validity of kinetic and isotherm models three error functions viz chi square sum of square of errors and residual root mean square error were used as described in supplementary text s3 2 3 column adsorption experiments the pgo nanoadsorbent was packed at the end of a 20 cm glass tube having internal diameter 1 9 cm a small cotton plug was fixed at the end of the column to avoid the loss of any nanoadsorbent the bed height was 5 0 cm 50 ml of 5 mgl 1 of pb ii as iii ions solution at optimized ph was infiltrated downward through the column under gravity with a flow rate of 2 0 mlmin 1 effluents were collected and analyzed using icap oes until metal ions concentration reduced to the permissible limits the efficiency of pgo was comparatively studied using common adsorbent i e activated carbon granular size 1 5 mm thomas model was applied to study the adsorption kinetics and its linearized form is expressed as eq 3 23 3 ln c o c t 1 k th q o m v k th c o t where co is inlet concentration of metal ions ct is the effluent concentration kth is thomas rate constant l mg 1 min 1 qo is maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 m is mass of adsorbent g v stands for flow rate 2 0 ml min 1 and t for time minutes the values of kth and qo were calculated by linear regression analysis the sampling quantitative and qualitative analysis was schematically shown in scheme s1 2 4 real water experiments the removal of pb ii and as iii ions from synthetic water spiked in laboratory was different from that of samples collected from river water and wastewater due to the presence of other co existing inorganic and organic contaminants for spiking the stock solution of 5 mg l 1 concentration of pb ii as iii ions were prepared by dissolving their appropriate amounts in 1 l of each river water and wastewater the removal process was conducted in 250 ml conical flask by adding nanoadsorbent with optimized dose and 100 ml filtrate the suspensions were continuously stirred for 2 h in an orbital shaker and centrifuged the concentration of metal ions in the filtrate was determined using icap oes analysis 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of synthesized graphene oxides the bonding environment in go b go and p go was studied by xps analysis a full survey scan of pristine go fig 1a displayed the c 1s and o 1s peaks at 284 ev and 532 ev respectively after doping new peaks were observed at 189 ev and 133 ev due to b 1s and p 2p dopants respectively the c 1s peak of go can be deconvoluted into three major peaks located at 284 ev 286 ev and 289 ev corresponding to cc c o c o c and c ooh moieties respectively fig 1b high resolution spectrum of o 1s energy levels in go showed peak at 530 ev and 532 ev which were assigned to co and co bands fig 1c these observations indicated that the as synthesized go was rich in carbonyl and carboxylic acid functionalities on the surface whereas the high resolution c 1s and o 1s xps spectra of the b go and p go exhibited weakening in intensities of these oxygenated functionalities furthermore these peaks moved to lower binding energy due to the interaction of dopants with surface oxygeneous moieties the b 1s spectrum of b go can be spilt into two peaks assigned to in plane bc3 type bonding 189 ev and borinic ester c2bo boronic acid cbo2 moieties 191 ev indicating that the boron exists in three distinct chemical environments 24 fig 1d the deconvoluted spectrum of p 2p in p go showed two peaks at binding energies of 133 ev and 134 ev corresponding to the pc and po species respectively 25 fig 1e the peak at 133 ev confirmed substitutional doping of p into graphitic lattice thus xps analysis confirmed the presence of both substitutional and surface transfer doping of go the xps quantitative distribution revealed that 96 9 po and 3 1 of pc moieties were present in p go whereas in b go 93 4 c2bo cbo2 and 6 3 bc moieties were present raman spectra of pristine and doped go fig 1f exhibited d band ascribed to the defect induced mode and g band corresponding to the in plane vibrations of the sp2 bonded carbon atoms the intensity ratio of the d to g band id ig is strongly related to the degree of disorder the id ig values of b go 1 02 and p go 1 17 were higher than go 0 84 due to increased number of defects the d and g bands of b go and p go were broader and of higher intensity as compared to pristine go raman spectrum of go showed d band at 1342 cm 1 and g band at 1585 cm 1 chemical interactions of go with electron acceptor dopant boron resulted in change in the density of π electrons and an upshift was observed for the g band from 1585 cm 1 to 1594 cm 1 similar observations were reported by haquee et al 26 for boron functionalized graphene oxide organic framework contrarily in p go both d and g bands peak positions remained the same as in go but with increased defect ratio and full width at half maxima suggesting the presence of more defects which indicated increase in defects favoured enhanced adsorption potential the fourier transformation infrared ft ir spectra showed presence of surface functional groups in pristine go and doped go fig 2a the presence of c b p bond in the ft ir spectra confirmed some extent of substitutional doping occurred along with surface transfer doping the details of ft ir spectra are discussed in supplementary text s4 the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of go showed broad reflections centred at 2θ 10 9 hkl 001 and 42 7 hkl 101 27 whereas b go and p go displayed peaks at 2θ 24 9 hkl 002 43 7 hkl 101 and 25 6 hkl 002 43 9 hkl 101 respectively fig 2b the xrd diffraction peaks of both b go and p go shifted to a higher 2θ value as compared to go indicating a decrease in d spacing of go on doping this decrease is attributed to the reduction of oxygeneous functional groups during annealing and interactions of b p containing groups on the edges and surface of the go layers the d spacing of most intense peak of go b go and p go at 2θ 10 9 24 9 and 25 6 was calculated using bragg s equation 28 and was observed to be 0 78 nm 0 34 nm and 0 33 nm respectively diffraction peaks after doping were weaker and broader suggesting that b p doping can induce more disorders and defects in the graphitic lattice 29 the difference in atomic sizes of dopants and carbon resulted in decrement in crystallinity for the doped go these results corroborated with the xps studies surface area and pore structure was examined via nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms using bet analysis and barrett joyner halenda bjh adsorption model respectively specific surface area of go b go and p go was 77 4 m2g 1 127 4 m2g 1 and 144 4 m2g 1 respectively fig 3a the higher specific surface area of doped go was due to insertion of dopants during synthesis thus doping created predictably porous structure in the go network and enlarged the go edges moreover p as a dopant caused more distortion of go lattice due to its larger atomic radius 1 07 å as compared to b 0 84 å that favoured higher surface area of p go as compared to b go all the materials exhibited h3 hysteresis curves of type iv as classified by iupac classification the type iv h3 hysteresis curve is the characteristic of loose assemblages of plate slit like pores 30 the pore size distribution curve of pure and doped go fig 3b exhibited a sharp narrow peak in the range of 3 51 3 61 nm and the pore volume was in the range of 0 03 0 12 cm3g 1 the enhanced surface area of doped go favoured higher adsorption surface composition and topography of synthesized materials was studied using transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscopic electron dispersive spectra sem eds tem micrographs of go fig 4a showed silk veil waves with crumpled sheet like morphology due to thermodynamic instability of go sheets 29 after doping nanosheets tangled with each other with more wrinkled and distorted structure than go fig 4b c these corrugations and wrinkles most probably originated from the b and p containing functionalities in the nanosheets and the structural distortion caused by variation in bond angles and bond length when dopants were incorporated into go nanosheets the surface crumpling and folding produced lots of open edge sites which were favourable for the adsorption applications sem images of go revealed corrugations and smooth surface containing small pores fig 4d however for b go and p go highly interconnected porous network structure was observed fig 4e f similar distortion was observed in the tem micrographs the atomic and weight percentage of different elements was depicted by eds fig 4g in the eds spectrum of p go additional peaks for p were also observed along with c and o peaks fig 4i but the peak for b was not observed in the eds spectrum of b go as lighter elements does not possess bremsstrahlung scattering 28 31 fig 4h 3 2 comparative adsorption characteristics of b go and p go the preliminary experiment was performed to find out the best nanoadsorbent and to study the effect of the nature and content of dopant p go was observed to have higher adsorption capacity as compared to b go and go the major factor for the higher adsorption potential of p go could be the increase in the surface area of p go 144 4 m2g 1 as compared to b go 127 4 m2g 1 as depicted by bet analysis it was further confirmed by dynamic light scattering studies these studies showed that the particle size of go b go and p go was 115 nm 100 nm and 80 nm respectively the greater interaction of p containing groups on go surface may result into exfoliation of go sheets leading to smaller particle size and more surface wrinkling smaller particles with a larger density of surface sites have higher retention capacity for metal ions 32 these results were further supported by xps quantitative distribution data which revealed the presence of more po moieties in case of p go as compared to c2bo cbo2 moieties in b go these moieties provide binding sites for pb ii and as iii adsorption fig s1a depicts an increase in the b or p content in the go had a positive influence on adsorption capacity up to a w w ratio of 10 1 on further increasing dopant content in go saturation behaviour in the adsorption capacity was observed further experiments were conducted on p go because of its better adsorption performance as compared to b go and pristine go 3 2 1 effect of solution ph and nanoadsorbent dose the ph of the solution is a definitive parameter in the adsorption studies percentage removal of pb ii ions increased progressively from 45 0 01 qe 11 5 mg g 1 to 89 0 4 qe 22 1 mg g 1 with the increase in solution ph from 2 0 to 6 0 respectively fig s1b the oxygeneous functional groups on p go surface became more negative at higher ph boosting the electrostatic attraction between the pb ii ions and p go however under acidic ph relatively low pb ii uptake was observed due to the presence of excess of h ions which compete with pb ii ions for the active sites the removal trend for pb ii and as iii was governed by zero point charge phzpc and speciation of metal ions in the aqueous solution the phzpc studies fig s3a revealed surface charge on p go became zero at ph 5 0 above ph 5 0 pb ii ions were strongly attracted towards the negatively charged p go surface resulting in maximum uptake of pb ii ions speciation of pb ii in aqueous solution showed that free ionic pb ii is the most concentrated form 80 90 up to ph 6 0 whereas pb oh 2 90 100 dominates after this ph fig s2a under alkaline conditions pb ii started to form insoluble pb oh 2 and 96 0 02 removal was observed so in order to avoid precipitation further experiments were performed at ph 6 0 however the adsorption of as iii on p go showed different behaviour the percentage removal of as iii ions increased continuously from 43 0 04 qe 11 3 mg g 1 to 83 0 7 qe 20 5 mg g 1 at ph 2 0 to 7 0 and then decreased to 73 0 08 qe 17 3 mg g 1 at ph 10 0 the speciation studies have revealed that arsenic iii exists as as oh 3 neutral species up to ph 7 0 and above this oxyanion aso oh 2 is the dominated form fig s2b 33 the decrease in percentage removal above ph 7 0 was due to electrostatic repulsions between negatively charged surface and oxyanion species but below ph 7 0 surface complexation phenomenon well explained this trend rather than electrostatic interactions spectroscopic and surface complexation model studies with iron oxide surfaces have reported that as iii forms a single bidentate binuclear complex 34 35 at high ph less surface complexes were formed due to the electrostatic repulsion between the ionized species aso oh 2 whereas at low ph more surface complexes were formed between p go and as oh 3 species which resulted in more adsorption of as iii ions hence the optimum ph for as iii ions was 7 0 surface charge also plays a vital role in the adsorption process the ξ potential of p go was negative at optimum ph fig s3b the negative charge due to phosphoanhydride linkages was responsible for the electrostatic attraction between positively charge pb ii ions and negatively charge p go surface for as iii ions at optimized ph 7 0 the surface of p go was negatively charged so as iii adsorption could not be explained on the basis of zeta potential values but surface complexation phenomenon well explained the enhanced as iii adsorption on p go as compared to pristine go the optimum dose of p go was observed to be 0 4 gl 1 fig s3c the details are given in supplementary text s5 3 2 2 kinetic modelling kinetic studies revealed that adsorption was faster in the initial phase due to ease and abundance of binding sites and the high concentration of metal ions kinetics of pb ii and as iii removal using p go is shown in fig s3d the percentage removal increased promptly in the first 30 min and saturation was achieved at 60 and 120 min of shaking for pb ii ions and as iii ions respectively pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion kinetic models in the linear and non linear forms were applied to explore the mechanism of pb ii and as iii adsorption by the nanoadsorbent details of modelling are given in supplementary text s6 it was observed that pseudo first order kinetic model deviated from linearity and high statistical metrics predicted its non suitability pseudo second order kinetic model fig s4a was followed r2 99 which signified that adsorption rate is directly related to two binding sites 36 there was a good correlation between experimental and theoretical uptake capacity at equilibrium time qe values for pseudo second order kinetic model details of elovich and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models are given in supplementary text s7 the best fit kinetic model should have reasonable correlation with theoretical and experimental qe and secondly statistical metrics values should be minimum low statistical metrics fig s4 and comparable experimental and theoretical qe values in case of non linear pseudo first order kinetic model suggested its validity over linear form tables 1 and s1 show the calculated parameters and error functions of the linear and non linear kinetic models the results showed that best fit kinetic model was linear pseudo second order followed by elovich intra particle diffusion and pseudo first order to describe the adsorption kinetics 3 2 3 adsorption isotherm modelling and thermodynamic studies the interaction mechanism between adsorbate ions and nanoadsorbent was evaluated using langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich dr and temkin adsorption isotherm models in linear and non linear forms the details plots and parameters of isotherm models are explained in supplementary data s8 and tables 1 and s2 respectively linear and non linear langmuir isotherm studies depicted higher maximum langmuir adsorption capacity qmax of 388 8 mg g 1 and affinity b of 0 07 l mg 1 for pb ii ions as compared to as iii ions qmax 157 mg g 1 b 0 06 l mg 1 a favourable adsorption nature was depicted by equilibrium parameter r values ranging from 0 to 1 the qmax values of p go for pb ii and as iii ions were compared with other reported adsorbents 37 53 tables 2 3 a comparison of results clearly demonstrated that p go has a high qmax value for both metal ions as compared to many reported adsorbents in our previous work n go was evaluated as adsorbent for the removal of pb ii and as iii ions with qmax values of 570 0 and 39 0 mg g 1 respectively 54 for pb ii ions n go acted as a better nanoadsorbent than p go due to its more negative ξ potential values at ph 6 0 as negative surface provides more electrostatic attraction forces to bind with positively charged pb ii ions contrary results were observed for as iii ions higher qmax value of p go for as iii ions than n go may be due to the presence of phosphorous containing functional moieties which aided the adsorption of as iii ions freundlich dr and temkin adsorption isotherm models are also discussed in supplementary text s9 if the value of n is greater than one in freundlich model then p go shows physical adsorption 55 in our study the value of n is greater than one thus physical adsorption took place between p go and pb ii as iii ions comparative analysis of linear and non linear adsorption isotherm fitting curves fig s5 and statistical errors χ2 sse and rmse tables 1 and s2 confirmed that the linear forms yielded a much better fit than the non linear ones due to lower error values the fitting of adsorption models is dependent on the nature of adsorbent and synthetic adsorbents mostly follow linear forms of models 56 the effect of temperature on the adsorption of ions is presented in supplementary text s10 and fig s6a the positive change in entropy s table s3 value resulted from an increase in randomness at the adsorbent adsorbate interface during adsorption before the adsorption process the metal ions were orderly distributed on the nanoadsorbent surface after adsorption there is an increase in the translational and rotational energy of metal ions which led to increase in randomness in solution 35 positive change in enthalpy h value depicted endothermic nature of pb ii with optimum temperature of 50 c in case of as iii ions the adsorption was endothermic with optimum temperature 25 c increase in adsorption up to the optimum temperature was due to increased diffusion in mesoporous nanoadsorbent but above this temperature desorption took place lower optimum temperature for as iii confirmed weaker binding as compared to pb ii this was also confirmed by xps studies the negative change in gibbs free energy g value confirmed spontaneous nature of adsorption fig s6b 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism of pb ii and as iii ions on the p go surface was predicted from adsorption isotherm kinetic modelling xps raman and ft ir results the good fitting of the langmuir adsorption isotherm model indicated physical and monolayered adsorption of both ions the fitness of pseudo second order kinetic model also suggested that pb ii as iii ions interacted with two active sites of nanoadsorbent furthermore the pseudo second order rate constant values for pb ii ions were higher than the as iii ions indicating the rapid adsorption of pb ii ions from aqueous media raman spectra confirmed greater defects in p go as compared to b go and the presence of these heterogenous sites favoured higher adsorption xps and ft ir spectra of p go were further assessed after adsorption of pb ii and as iii ions the full scan xps survey spectrum of pb ii adsorbed p go and as iii adsorbed p go fig 5a displayed new peaks for pb 4f and as 3d along with all the peaks present before pb ii as iii adsorption the peaks at 286 ev co 531 ev co and 134 ev po were shifted to lower binding energies in the process of adsorption indicating the change in the local binding environment the pb 4f photoelectron peak was resolved into two peaks located at 136 ev and 141 ev which corresponded to pb 4f7 2 and pb 4f5 2 respectively fig 5b the peak at 136 ev is due to the pbo bond suggesting the successful adsorption of pb ii on the surface of the p go in the xps survey spectrum of as iii adsorbed p go fig 5c the peak at 47 ev was due to as 3d binding configurations lower binding energy for as iii ions further confirmed the lower affinity of p go for as iii ions as compared to pb ii ions these results revealed co and po functional moieties are binding sites for pb ii and as iii ions in the ft ir spectrum of pb ii adsorbed p go fig s7 all vibrational bands except cp and cc showed red shift indicating the attachment of pb ii ions to the o atom of carboxyl carbonyl and phospho anhydride functional groups transmittance of these bands was also subdued upon pb ii adsorption the interaction of pb ii ions with oxygenous functional groups was due to electrostatic ion exchange reactions the oxygen atom contain lone pair of electrons which can bind to pb ii by sharing the electrons and form stable complex the proton on cooh or oh was released to the solution during adsorption process the exchange of pb ii and h on cooh or oh oxygenous groups was responsible for the adsorption of pb ii onto p go surface in ft ir spectrum of as iii adsorbed p go fig s7 similar red shift was observed confirming the interaction of as with o atom due to electrostatic ion exchange reactions the band at 660 cm 1 referred to the formation of as oh bond thus the xps and ft ir studies provided a strong evidence for the adsorption of metal ions on the surface of p go through c and o atoms of co and po moieties 3 2 5 column and real water studies in constituent of the batch studies the p go also displayed the excellent efficiency in column experiments the column experiments proved to be highly effective and reduced the metal ion concentration below the permissible limit pb ii and as iii concentrations left in solutions after the seventh consecutive column experiment was decreased below the 50 and 10 μgl 1 respectively which is the limit value of pb ii and as iii concentration for the drinking water who in comparison the column experiments using activated charcoal showed that it required ten runs for the concentration of metal ions to reach the permissible limit thus confirming superiority of p go over activated charcoal breakthrough curves for pb ii and as iii adsorption onto activated charcoal and p go fig 6a b and their corresponding thomas plots fig 6c d were studied the breakthrough time for the p go was longer than activated charcoal suggesting higher adsorption capacity of former for both the ions these results were also supported by higher thomas rate constant and maximum adsorption capacity values for p go listed in table 4 thus p go can be used as an alternative adsorbent in the column the column capacity 126 2 mg g 1 for pb ii ions 86 4 mg g 1 for as iii ions was significantly lower than batch adsorption capacity 388 1 mg g 1 for pb ii ions 157 4 mg g 1 for as iii ions this observation is similar to those reported for pb ii and as iii adsorption by chitosan modified biochar 57 and clinoptilolite glycine 58 this may be due to less contact time between mobile adsorbate ion and stationary adsorbent bed in the column but the advantage of column experiment over batch experiment is that it can reduce the metal ion concentration below the permissible limit by optimizing the number of runs pgo adsorption capacity was further studied on waste water and river water and it was observed that the uptake of pb ii and as iii ions was retarded in the real water samples due to the presence of other inorganic ions and organic matter as explained in supplementary text s11 3 2 6 effect of coexisting ions selectivity and renewability studies the adsorption capacity of the p go was studied in the presence of pb ii cd ii zn ii and ni ii ions fig 7a the observed trend for removal was pb ii cd ii zn ii ni ii and it can be explained by distribution and selectivity studies the distribution coefficient and selectivity factor listed in table s4 summarized that the adsorption of pb ii ions in the presence of other metal ions was higher thus p go showed strong ability to selectivity adsorb pb ii ions this adsorption behaviour was explained by ionic radii of the metal ions table s4 larger the ionic size of ions lower is their hydrated radii hence have a greater affinity to get adsorbed the adsorption capacity of p go for pb ii cd ii zn ii and ni ii ions decreased in the quaternary system than single system due to competition between metal ions for the adsorption sites available on p go surface the effect of presence of anions viz cl no3 2 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 was also tested on the pb ii and as iii adsorption the increase in anion concentration from 0 01 to 10 0 mm showed a negative effect on metal ions adsorption however this negative impact is maximum in the presence of po4 2 ions this may be due to comparable chemical properties of po4 2 to arsenic and ease of formation of inner sphere complex to nanoadsorbent in case of pb ii ions the observed result was due to electrostatic interactions of positively charged pb ii with phosphate anion 59 the no3 2 so4 2 and cl anions showed similar decrease in percentage removal for both metal ions fig s8a b in the presence of co3 2 ions at high concentration the pb ii and as iii adsorption is declined due to the formation of arseno and lead carbonate complexes respectively 60 61 regeneration studies are vital for confirming reusability of spent adsorbent the removal efficiencies of pb ii and as iii slightly diminished after five adsorption desorption cycles fig 7b it still retained 85 adsorption efficiency for pb ii ions and 78 for as iii ions the reduction in adsorption potential of nanoadsorbent was due to loss of sample during each operation similar decline in adsorptive performance of fe3o4 sio2 go nanocomposites is reported 62 thus p go showed excellent stability and regeneration 4 conclusions doping of b and p atoms into go induced distinct morphological and structural changes in the go nanosheets b and p doped go had large surface area and defects as well as contained moieties of po 96 9 pc 3 1 c2bo cbo2 93 4 and bc 6 3 that contributed to their higher adsorptive performance than pristine go higher adsorptive potential of p go for pb ii ions qmax 388 8 mg g 1 and as iii ions qmax 157 4 mg g 1 as compared to b go could be ascribed to higher surface area 144 4 m2g 1 functional moieties and smaller particle size 80 nm pb ii adsorption was also favoured by its negative ξ potential however as iii adsorption was favoured by the formation of surface complexes of as oh 3 with po moieties p go has advantage over n go due to the presence of phosphorous containing functional moieties which aided the adsorption of as iii ions p go exhibited good reusability and reproducibility even after five adsorption desorption cycles 85 for pb ii ions 78 for as iii ions column studies revealed that the concentration of pb ii and as iii could be modulated within permissible limits by optimizing the number of cycles thus p doping is an effective strategy for tuning the properties of go as a nanoadsorbent credit authorship contribution statement manpreet kaur

12557,graphene oxide go doped with heteroatoms are gaining interest in depollution of water because of their large surface area this paper presents for the first time the comparative adsorptive properties of boron and phosphorous doped go b go and p go to remove pb ii and as iii ions from water the doped go were synthesized by two step approach and fully characterized using various analytical techniques to demonstrate their distinct structural and adsorptive features the brunauer emmett teller bet surface areas of b go 127 4 m2g 1 and p go 144 4 m2g 1 were higher than that of pristine go 77 4 m2g 1 due to insertion of dopants during synthesis the defects in the doped go were higher which were seen in measurements of band intensity ratio of defect band to graphene band in the raman spectra of b go p go and pristine go as 1 02 1 17 and 0 84 respectively the xps studies revealed that 96 9 po and 3 1 of pc moieties were present in p go whereas in b go 93 4 c2bo cbo2 and 6 3 bc moieties were present thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of adsorption of pb ii and as iii onto doped go and pristine go were determined under different experimental conditions of ph adsorbent dose and co existing ions results were interpreted using linear and non linear isotherms and kinetic modelling the langmuir binding capacities of p go were 388 1 mgg 1 and 157 4 mgg 1 for pb ii and as iii ions respectively which were higher than b go and pristine go higher adsorption capacity of p go was delineated on the basis of functional moieties surface defects smaller particle size and larger surface area the renewability experiment showed a negligible decrease in adsorption capacity of p go even after five repeated cycles column studies supported the applicability of p go as an effective adsorbent for removing metal ions in the continuous system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords doped graphene oxide boron and phosphorus doping pb ii and as iii removal adsorption mechanism kinetics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pollution caused by toxic heavy metal ions and metalloids is a matter of global concern the electroplating battery manufacturing industries and leaching from geological formations are the main sources of metal pollution 1 lead pb ii and arsenite as iii have attracted immense concern owing to their deleterious effect at low concentrations 2 3 the main sources of pb ii in the groundwater are lead pipes and plumbing fixtures 4 as iii in the form of lead arsenate copper arsenate is used in pesticides manufacturing industries from where it leaches and contaminate the ground water according to world health organization who guidelines the permissible limit of pb ii and as iii in water is 50 μg l 1 and 10 μg l 1 respectively 5 6 various approaches viz ion exchange chemical precipitation reverse osmosis oxidation reduction degradation adsorption and membrane filtration have been examined to remove these toxic metal ions from water 7 8 among these technologies adsorption is an attractive strategy because it is considered as a robust energy efficient and environmentally benign process 9 the current paper focuses on carbon based materials i e doped graphene oxide go as adsorbent go has rich adsorptive sites and large surface area as well as tunable structure having epoxy hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups on surface to remove noxious ions 10 13 however the layers of pristine go can irreversibly aggregate due to the existence of strong interplanar reciprocities which hinder the effective adsorptive performance 14 this limitation may be alleviated by modifying go in literature different approaches have been applied to increase the adsorptive properties of go that include the fabrication of nanocomposites or the insertion of heteroatoms in the go lattice the later approach improves the adsorption potential of go significantly by enhancing its local defects and mesoporosity 15 among the heteroatoms doped go most of adsorption studies have been performed using nitrogen doped go n go 16 17 currently no study is known in the literature on the applications of b go and p go as adsorbents for heavy metal ions and metalloids furthermore investigations using b go and p go are limited to inorganic compounds e g ammonia and organics e g oxytetracycline and dyes 15 18 20 the present studies are thus aimed to comparatively examine the adsorptive properties of b go and p go adsorption performance was examined using pb ii and as iii as model pollutants firstly the content of b and p was optimized in the doped go for maximum removal of these pollutants surface and analytical techniques were employed to seek the distinct differences between b go and p go higher adsorption potential of p go as compared to b go and go was explained on the basis of raman x ray photoelectron spectra xps thermodynamics adsorption isotherm and kinetic modelling effect of various influencing parameters viz ph adsorbent dose contact time co existing ions and temperature on pb ii and as iii removal using p go as adsorbent was studied results were interpreted using linear and non linear adsorption isotherms and kinetic modelling the studies were extended to estimate the efficiency of p go in the dynamic water system by conducting the column adsorption studies p go not only affords facile synthesis but also exhibits excellent adsorption capacity in the batch and column studies concentration time profile was predicted using thomas model 2 experimental methods all the chemicals viz graphite powder orthoboric acid h3bo3 orthophosphoric acid h3po4 sulphuric acid h2so4 hydrogen chloride hcl lead nitrate pb no3 2 4h2o sodium arsenite naaso2 sodium nitrate nano3 potassium permanganate kmno4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hydroxide naoh of analytical grade were procured from sd fine pvt ltd and used without further purification all the solutions were prepared in deionized water 2 1 synthesis of doped graphene oxide phosphorous doped graphene oxide p go from orthophosphoric acid with variable phosphorous dopant content from 1 0 to 30 0 w w part of phosphorous and go was synthesized in two steps in the first step graphene oxide go was synthesized using modified hummer s method 21 in the second step orthophosphoric acid and 150 ml of go aqueous suspension 3 3 mg ml 1 were mixed and stirred 150 rpm in a 150 ml of round bottom flask for 2 h under ambient conditions the obtained mixture was oven dried at 60 c overnight and then placed in a muffle furnace at 300 c for 3 h so that p dopant was covalently attached to the oxygenous functional groups of go and at that temperature orthophosphoric moiety was converted into its diphosphoric form the annealed powder was re dispersed in distilled water to form a suspension of p go the resulting product was sonicated for 6 h frequency of 90 khz power of 40 w to get layered structure the synthesized pgo was washed with hcl solution followed by distilled water to remove impurities of phosphorous oxide boron doped graphene oxide b go was also synthesized in the similar way using orthoboric acid as a boron containing source the details of instrumentation used for characterization of go b go and p go is given in supplementary text s1 2 2 batch adsorption experiments and statistical analysis stock solution of pb ii and as iii ions 100 mgl 1 was prepared by dissolving pb no3 4h2o and naaso2 in distilled water the first experiment was conducted to find out the best nanoadsorbent using 5 mgl 1 concentration of pb ii as iii ions 100 ml and 0 2 gl 1 of nanoadsorbents at 25 c then using the best nanoadsorbent i e p go further experiments were performed effect of ph 2 0 to 10 0 and temperature 10 to 55 c was studied using 0 4 gl 1 of p go in 100 ml solution of pb ii as iii ions 5 mgl 1 and the mixture was agitated for 2 h van t hoff equation was used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters supplementary text s2 the impact of adsorbent dose on pb ii and as iii ions each 5 mgl 1 adsorption was studied by varying the adsorbent dose from 0 04 to 6 0 gl 1 for isotherm experiments 0 4 gl 1 of p go with 100 ml of pb ii as iii ion solution with varied concentration 2 100 mgl 1 was agitated in an orbital shaker incubator for 2 h at optimum ph for adsorption kinetic studies 0 4 gl 1 of p go was added into 100 ml of pb ii as iii solution 5 mgl 1 and agitated up to 180 min at optimum ph after each experiment the samples were centrifugated and centrifugate was used to determine the concentration of analyte using inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectroscopy icap oes technique limits of detection lod and limit of quantification loq were also evaluated for pb ii and as iii ions as explained in supplementary data s1 all the batch experiments were conducted thrice and mean values are reported the adsorption efficiency ae and adsorption capacity qt of p go were calculated using the following eqs 1 and 2 22 1 adsorption effciency ae c i c t c i 100 2 adsorption capacity q t c i c t w v where ci ct v and w are the initial metal concentration mgl 1 concentration at time t volume of solution l and adsorbent dosage g respectively the zero point charge phzpc of samples was determined by plotting a graph between initial ph and δph phfinal phinitial the effect of solution ph on percent distribution of different forms of pb ii and as iii in solution was calculated using visual minteq software the impact of coexisting cations was studied in the quaternary system of pb ii cd ii zn ii and ni ii with 100 ml of 0 1 mm solution of metal ions and 0 4 gl 1 of nanoadsorbent at ph 6 0 25 c for 2 h whereas the influence of anions viz cl no3 2 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 ions having concentration ranging from 0 1 to 10 0 mm was studied using their sodium salts adsorption of pb ii and as iii ions each 100 ml of 0 1 mmoll 1 was investigated using 0 4 gl 1 of nanoadsorbent at 25 c for 2 h reusability studies were carried out using 0 2 g of p go in 100 ml of 5 mgl 1 pb ii and as iii solutions the prepared solutions were agitated for 2 h at 120 rpm at 25 c and centrifugates were analyzed to determine the concentration of pb ii as iii ions after that the spent nanoadsorbent was collected dispersed and then regenerated with 0 1 m hcl the treated nanoadsorbent was used for next adsorption experiment further to evaluate the validity of kinetic and isotherm models three error functions viz chi square sum of square of errors and residual root mean square error were used as described in supplementary text s3 2 3 column adsorption experiments the pgo nanoadsorbent was packed at the end of a 20 cm glass tube having internal diameter 1 9 cm a small cotton plug was fixed at the end of the column to avoid the loss of any nanoadsorbent the bed height was 5 0 cm 50 ml of 5 mgl 1 of pb ii as iii ions solution at optimized ph was infiltrated downward through the column under gravity with a flow rate of 2 0 mlmin 1 effluents were collected and analyzed using icap oes until metal ions concentration reduced to the permissible limits the efficiency of pgo was comparatively studied using common adsorbent i e activated carbon granular size 1 5 mm thomas model was applied to study the adsorption kinetics and its linearized form is expressed as eq 3 23 3 ln c o c t 1 k th q o m v k th c o t where co is inlet concentration of metal ions ct is the effluent concentration kth is thomas rate constant l mg 1 min 1 qo is maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 m is mass of adsorbent g v stands for flow rate 2 0 ml min 1 and t for time minutes the values of kth and qo were calculated by linear regression analysis the sampling quantitative and qualitative analysis was schematically shown in scheme s1 2 4 real water experiments the removal of pb ii and as iii ions from synthetic water spiked in laboratory was different from that of samples collected from river water and wastewater due to the presence of other co existing inorganic and organic contaminants for spiking the stock solution of 5 mg l 1 concentration of pb ii as iii ions were prepared by dissolving their appropriate amounts in 1 l of each river water and wastewater the removal process was conducted in 250 ml conical flask by adding nanoadsorbent with optimized dose and 100 ml filtrate the suspensions were continuously stirred for 2 h in an orbital shaker and centrifuged the concentration of metal ions in the filtrate was determined using icap oes analysis 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of synthesized graphene oxides the bonding environment in go b go and p go was studied by xps analysis a full survey scan of pristine go fig 1a displayed the c 1s and o 1s peaks at 284 ev and 532 ev respectively after doping new peaks were observed at 189 ev and 133 ev due to b 1s and p 2p dopants respectively the c 1s peak of go can be deconvoluted into three major peaks located at 284 ev 286 ev and 289 ev corresponding to cc c o c o c and c ooh moieties respectively fig 1b high resolution spectrum of o 1s energy levels in go showed peak at 530 ev and 532 ev which were assigned to co and co bands fig 1c these observations indicated that the as synthesized go was rich in carbonyl and carboxylic acid functionalities on the surface whereas the high resolution c 1s and o 1s xps spectra of the b go and p go exhibited weakening in intensities of these oxygenated functionalities furthermore these peaks moved to lower binding energy due to the interaction of dopants with surface oxygeneous moieties the b 1s spectrum of b go can be spilt into two peaks assigned to in plane bc3 type bonding 189 ev and borinic ester c2bo boronic acid cbo2 moieties 191 ev indicating that the boron exists in three distinct chemical environments 24 fig 1d the deconvoluted spectrum of p 2p in p go showed two peaks at binding energies of 133 ev and 134 ev corresponding to the pc and po species respectively 25 fig 1e the peak at 133 ev confirmed substitutional doping of p into graphitic lattice thus xps analysis confirmed the presence of both substitutional and surface transfer doping of go the xps quantitative distribution revealed that 96 9 po and 3 1 of pc moieties were present in p go whereas in b go 93 4 c2bo cbo2 and 6 3 bc moieties were present raman spectra of pristine and doped go fig 1f exhibited d band ascribed to the defect induced mode and g band corresponding to the in plane vibrations of the sp2 bonded carbon atoms the intensity ratio of the d to g band id ig is strongly related to the degree of disorder the id ig values of b go 1 02 and p go 1 17 were higher than go 0 84 due to increased number of defects the d and g bands of b go and p go were broader and of higher intensity as compared to pristine go raman spectrum of go showed d band at 1342 cm 1 and g band at 1585 cm 1 chemical interactions of go with electron acceptor dopant boron resulted in change in the density of π electrons and an upshift was observed for the g band from 1585 cm 1 to 1594 cm 1 similar observations were reported by haquee et al 26 for boron functionalized graphene oxide organic framework contrarily in p go both d and g bands peak positions remained the same as in go but with increased defect ratio and full width at half maxima suggesting the presence of more defects which indicated increase in defects favoured enhanced adsorption potential the fourier transformation infrared ft ir spectra showed presence of surface functional groups in pristine go and doped go fig 2a the presence of c b p bond in the ft ir spectra confirmed some extent of substitutional doping occurred along with surface transfer doping the details of ft ir spectra are discussed in supplementary text s4 the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of go showed broad reflections centred at 2θ 10 9 hkl 001 and 42 7 hkl 101 27 whereas b go and p go displayed peaks at 2θ 24 9 hkl 002 43 7 hkl 101 and 25 6 hkl 002 43 9 hkl 101 respectively fig 2b the xrd diffraction peaks of both b go and p go shifted to a higher 2θ value as compared to go indicating a decrease in d spacing of go on doping this decrease is attributed to the reduction of oxygeneous functional groups during annealing and interactions of b p containing groups on the edges and surface of the go layers the d spacing of most intense peak of go b go and p go at 2θ 10 9 24 9 and 25 6 was calculated using bragg s equation 28 and was observed to be 0 78 nm 0 34 nm and 0 33 nm respectively diffraction peaks after doping were weaker and broader suggesting that b p doping can induce more disorders and defects in the graphitic lattice 29 the difference in atomic sizes of dopants and carbon resulted in decrement in crystallinity for the doped go these results corroborated with the xps studies surface area and pore structure was examined via nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms using bet analysis and barrett joyner halenda bjh adsorption model respectively specific surface area of go b go and p go was 77 4 m2g 1 127 4 m2g 1 and 144 4 m2g 1 respectively fig 3a the higher specific surface area of doped go was due to insertion of dopants during synthesis thus doping created predictably porous structure in the go network and enlarged the go edges moreover p as a dopant caused more distortion of go lattice due to its larger atomic radius 1 07 å as compared to b 0 84 å that favoured higher surface area of p go as compared to b go all the materials exhibited h3 hysteresis curves of type iv as classified by iupac classification the type iv h3 hysteresis curve is the characteristic of loose assemblages of plate slit like pores 30 the pore size distribution curve of pure and doped go fig 3b exhibited a sharp narrow peak in the range of 3 51 3 61 nm and the pore volume was in the range of 0 03 0 12 cm3g 1 the enhanced surface area of doped go favoured higher adsorption surface composition and topography of synthesized materials was studied using transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscopic electron dispersive spectra sem eds tem micrographs of go fig 4a showed silk veil waves with crumpled sheet like morphology due to thermodynamic instability of go sheets 29 after doping nanosheets tangled with each other with more wrinkled and distorted structure than go fig 4b c these corrugations and wrinkles most probably originated from the b and p containing functionalities in the nanosheets and the structural distortion caused by variation in bond angles and bond length when dopants were incorporated into go nanosheets the surface crumpling and folding produced lots of open edge sites which were favourable for the adsorption applications sem images of go revealed corrugations and smooth surface containing small pores fig 4d however for b go and p go highly interconnected porous network structure was observed fig 4e f similar distortion was observed in the tem micrographs the atomic and weight percentage of different elements was depicted by eds fig 4g in the eds spectrum of p go additional peaks for p were also observed along with c and o peaks fig 4i but the peak for b was not observed in the eds spectrum of b go as lighter elements does not possess bremsstrahlung scattering 28 31 fig 4h 3 2 comparative adsorption characteristics of b go and p go the preliminary experiment was performed to find out the best nanoadsorbent and to study the effect of the nature and content of dopant p go was observed to have higher adsorption capacity as compared to b go and go the major factor for the higher adsorption potential of p go could be the increase in the surface area of p go 144 4 m2g 1 as compared to b go 127 4 m2g 1 as depicted by bet analysis it was further confirmed by dynamic light scattering studies these studies showed that the particle size of go b go and p go was 115 nm 100 nm and 80 nm respectively the greater interaction of p containing groups on go surface may result into exfoliation of go sheets leading to smaller particle size and more surface wrinkling smaller particles with a larger density of surface sites have higher retention capacity for metal ions 32 these results were further supported by xps quantitative distribution data which revealed the presence of more po moieties in case of p go as compared to c2bo cbo2 moieties in b go these moieties provide binding sites for pb ii and as iii adsorption fig s1a depicts an increase in the b or p content in the go had a positive influence on adsorption capacity up to a w w ratio of 10 1 on further increasing dopant content in go saturation behaviour in the adsorption capacity was observed further experiments were conducted on p go because of its better adsorption performance as compared to b go and pristine go 3 2 1 effect of solution ph and nanoadsorbent dose the ph of the solution is a definitive parameter in the adsorption studies percentage removal of pb ii ions increased progressively from 45 0 01 qe 11 5 mg g 1 to 89 0 4 qe 22 1 mg g 1 with the increase in solution ph from 2 0 to 6 0 respectively fig s1b the oxygeneous functional groups on p go surface became more negative at higher ph boosting the electrostatic attraction between the pb ii ions and p go however under acidic ph relatively low pb ii uptake was observed due to the presence of excess of h ions which compete with pb ii ions for the active sites the removal trend for pb ii and as iii was governed by zero point charge phzpc and speciation of metal ions in the aqueous solution the phzpc studies fig s3a revealed surface charge on p go became zero at ph 5 0 above ph 5 0 pb ii ions were strongly attracted towards the negatively charged p go surface resulting in maximum uptake of pb ii ions speciation of pb ii in aqueous solution showed that free ionic pb ii is the most concentrated form 80 90 up to ph 6 0 whereas pb oh 2 90 100 dominates after this ph fig s2a under alkaline conditions pb ii started to form insoluble pb oh 2 and 96 0 02 removal was observed so in order to avoid precipitation further experiments were performed at ph 6 0 however the adsorption of as iii on p go showed different behaviour the percentage removal of as iii ions increased continuously from 43 0 04 qe 11 3 mg g 1 to 83 0 7 qe 20 5 mg g 1 at ph 2 0 to 7 0 and then decreased to 73 0 08 qe 17 3 mg g 1 at ph 10 0 the speciation studies have revealed that arsenic iii exists as as oh 3 neutral species up to ph 7 0 and above this oxyanion aso oh 2 is the dominated form fig s2b 33 the decrease in percentage removal above ph 7 0 was due to electrostatic repulsions between negatively charged surface and oxyanion species but below ph 7 0 surface complexation phenomenon well explained this trend rather than electrostatic interactions spectroscopic and surface complexation model studies with iron oxide surfaces have reported that as iii forms a single bidentate binuclear complex 34 35 at high ph less surface complexes were formed due to the electrostatic repulsion between the ionized species aso oh 2 whereas at low ph more surface complexes were formed between p go and as oh 3 species which resulted in more adsorption of as iii ions hence the optimum ph for as iii ions was 7 0 surface charge also plays a vital role in the adsorption process the ξ potential of p go was negative at optimum ph fig s3b the negative charge due to phosphoanhydride linkages was responsible for the electrostatic attraction between positively charge pb ii ions and negatively charge p go surface for as iii ions at optimized ph 7 0 the surface of p go was negatively charged so as iii adsorption could not be explained on the basis of zeta potential values but surface complexation phenomenon well explained the enhanced as iii adsorption on p go as compared to pristine go the optimum dose of p go was observed to be 0 4 gl 1 fig s3c the details are given in supplementary text s5 3 2 2 kinetic modelling kinetic studies revealed that adsorption was faster in the initial phase due to ease and abundance of binding sites and the high concentration of metal ions kinetics of pb ii and as iii removal using p go is shown in fig s3d the percentage removal increased promptly in the first 30 min and saturation was achieved at 60 and 120 min of shaking for pb ii ions and as iii ions respectively pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intra particle diffusion kinetic models in the linear and non linear forms were applied to explore the mechanism of pb ii and as iii adsorption by the nanoadsorbent details of modelling are given in supplementary text s6 it was observed that pseudo first order kinetic model deviated from linearity and high statistical metrics predicted its non suitability pseudo second order kinetic model fig s4a was followed r2 99 which signified that adsorption rate is directly related to two binding sites 36 there was a good correlation between experimental and theoretical uptake capacity at equilibrium time qe values for pseudo second order kinetic model details of elovich and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models are given in supplementary text s7 the best fit kinetic model should have reasonable correlation with theoretical and experimental qe and secondly statistical metrics values should be minimum low statistical metrics fig s4 and comparable experimental and theoretical qe values in case of non linear pseudo first order kinetic model suggested its validity over linear form tables 1 and s1 show the calculated parameters and error functions of the linear and non linear kinetic models the results showed that best fit kinetic model was linear pseudo second order followed by elovich intra particle diffusion and pseudo first order to describe the adsorption kinetics 3 2 3 adsorption isotherm modelling and thermodynamic studies the interaction mechanism between adsorbate ions and nanoadsorbent was evaluated using langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich dr and temkin adsorption isotherm models in linear and non linear forms the details plots and parameters of isotherm models are explained in supplementary data s8 and tables 1 and s2 respectively linear and non linear langmuir isotherm studies depicted higher maximum langmuir adsorption capacity qmax of 388 8 mg g 1 and affinity b of 0 07 l mg 1 for pb ii ions as compared to as iii ions qmax 157 mg g 1 b 0 06 l mg 1 a favourable adsorption nature was depicted by equilibrium parameter r values ranging from 0 to 1 the qmax values of p go for pb ii and as iii ions were compared with other reported adsorbents 37 53 tables 2 3 a comparison of results clearly demonstrated that p go has a high qmax value for both metal ions as compared to many reported adsorbents in our previous work n go was evaluated as adsorbent for the removal of pb ii and as iii ions with qmax values of 570 0 and 39 0 mg g 1 respectively 54 for pb ii ions n go acted as a better nanoadsorbent than p go due to its more negative ξ potential values at ph 6 0 as negative surface provides more electrostatic attraction forces to bind with positively charged pb ii ions contrary results were observed for as iii ions higher qmax value of p go for as iii ions than n go may be due to the presence of phosphorous containing functional moieties which aided the adsorption of as iii ions freundlich dr and temkin adsorption isotherm models are also discussed in supplementary text s9 if the value of n is greater than one in freundlich model then p go shows physical adsorption 55 in our study the value of n is greater than one thus physical adsorption took place between p go and pb ii as iii ions comparative analysis of linear and non linear adsorption isotherm fitting curves fig s5 and statistical errors χ2 sse and rmse tables 1 and s2 confirmed that the linear forms yielded a much better fit than the non linear ones due to lower error values the fitting of adsorption models is dependent on the nature of adsorbent and synthetic adsorbents mostly follow linear forms of models 56 the effect of temperature on the adsorption of ions is presented in supplementary text s10 and fig s6a the positive change in entropy s table s3 value resulted from an increase in randomness at the adsorbent adsorbate interface during adsorption before the adsorption process the metal ions were orderly distributed on the nanoadsorbent surface after adsorption there is an increase in the translational and rotational energy of metal ions which led to increase in randomness in solution 35 positive change in enthalpy h value depicted endothermic nature of pb ii with optimum temperature of 50 c in case of as iii ions the adsorption was endothermic with optimum temperature 25 c increase in adsorption up to the optimum temperature was due to increased diffusion in mesoporous nanoadsorbent but above this temperature desorption took place lower optimum temperature for as iii confirmed weaker binding as compared to pb ii this was also confirmed by xps studies the negative change in gibbs free energy g value confirmed spontaneous nature of adsorption fig s6b 3 2 4 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism of pb ii and as iii ions on the p go surface was predicted from adsorption isotherm kinetic modelling xps raman and ft ir results the good fitting of the langmuir adsorption isotherm model indicated physical and monolayered adsorption of both ions the fitness of pseudo second order kinetic model also suggested that pb ii as iii ions interacted with two active sites of nanoadsorbent furthermore the pseudo second order rate constant values for pb ii ions were higher than the as iii ions indicating the rapid adsorption of pb ii ions from aqueous media raman spectra confirmed greater defects in p go as compared to b go and the presence of these heterogenous sites favoured higher adsorption xps and ft ir spectra of p go were further assessed after adsorption of pb ii and as iii ions the full scan xps survey spectrum of pb ii adsorbed p go and as iii adsorbed p go fig 5a displayed new peaks for pb 4f and as 3d along with all the peaks present before pb ii as iii adsorption the peaks at 286 ev co 531 ev co and 134 ev po were shifted to lower binding energies in the process of adsorption indicating the change in the local binding environment the pb 4f photoelectron peak was resolved into two peaks located at 136 ev and 141 ev which corresponded to pb 4f7 2 and pb 4f5 2 respectively fig 5b the peak at 136 ev is due to the pbo bond suggesting the successful adsorption of pb ii on the surface of the p go in the xps survey spectrum of as iii adsorbed p go fig 5c the peak at 47 ev was due to as 3d binding configurations lower binding energy for as iii ions further confirmed the lower affinity of p go for as iii ions as compared to pb ii ions these results revealed co and po functional moieties are binding sites for pb ii and as iii ions in the ft ir spectrum of pb ii adsorbed p go fig s7 all vibrational bands except cp and cc showed red shift indicating the attachment of pb ii ions to the o atom of carboxyl carbonyl and phospho anhydride functional groups transmittance of these bands was also subdued upon pb ii adsorption the interaction of pb ii ions with oxygenous functional groups was due to electrostatic ion exchange reactions the oxygen atom contain lone pair of electrons which can bind to pb ii by sharing the electrons and form stable complex the proton on cooh or oh was released to the solution during adsorption process the exchange of pb ii and h on cooh or oh oxygenous groups was responsible for the adsorption of pb ii onto p go surface in ft ir spectrum of as iii adsorbed p go fig s7 similar red shift was observed confirming the interaction of as with o atom due to electrostatic ion exchange reactions the band at 660 cm 1 referred to the formation of as oh bond thus the xps and ft ir studies provided a strong evidence for the adsorption of metal ions on the surface of p go through c and o atoms of co and po moieties 3 2 5 column and real water studies in constituent of the batch studies the p go also displayed the excellent efficiency in column experiments the column experiments proved to be highly effective and reduced the metal ion concentration below the permissible limit pb ii and as iii concentrations left in solutions after the seventh consecutive column experiment was decreased below the 50 and 10 μgl 1 respectively which is the limit value of pb ii and as iii concentration for the drinking water who in comparison the column experiments using activated charcoal showed that it required ten runs for the concentration of metal ions to reach the permissible limit thus confirming superiority of p go over activated charcoal breakthrough curves for pb ii and as iii adsorption onto activated charcoal and p go fig 6a b and their corresponding thomas plots fig 6c d were studied the breakthrough time for the p go was longer than activated charcoal suggesting higher adsorption capacity of former for both the ions these results were also supported by higher thomas rate constant and maximum adsorption capacity values for p go listed in table 4 thus p go can be used as an alternative adsorbent in the column the column capacity 126 2 mg g 1 for pb ii ions 86 4 mg g 1 for as iii ions was significantly lower than batch adsorption capacity 388 1 mg g 1 for pb ii ions 157 4 mg g 1 for as iii ions this observation is similar to those reported for pb ii and as iii adsorption by chitosan modified biochar 57 and clinoptilolite glycine 58 this may be due to less contact time between mobile adsorbate ion and stationary adsorbent bed in the column but the advantage of column experiment over batch experiment is that it can reduce the metal ion concentration below the permissible limit by optimizing the number of runs pgo adsorption capacity was further studied on waste water and river water and it was observed that the uptake of pb ii and as iii ions was retarded in the real water samples due to the presence of other inorganic ions and organic matter as explained in supplementary text s11 3 2 6 effect of coexisting ions selectivity and renewability studies the adsorption capacity of the p go was studied in the presence of pb ii cd ii zn ii and ni ii ions fig 7a the observed trend for removal was pb ii cd ii zn ii ni ii and it can be explained by distribution and selectivity studies the distribution coefficient and selectivity factor listed in table s4 summarized that the adsorption of pb ii ions in the presence of other metal ions was higher thus p go showed strong ability to selectivity adsorb pb ii ions this adsorption behaviour was explained by ionic radii of the metal ions table s4 larger the ionic size of ions lower is their hydrated radii hence have a greater affinity to get adsorbed the adsorption capacity of p go for pb ii cd ii zn ii and ni ii ions decreased in the quaternary system than single system due to competition between metal ions for the adsorption sites available on p go surface the effect of presence of anions viz cl no3 2 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 3 was also tested on the pb ii and as iii adsorption the increase in anion concentration from 0 01 to 10 0 mm showed a negative effect on metal ions adsorption however this negative impact is maximum in the presence of po4 2 ions this may be due to comparable chemical properties of po4 2 to arsenic and ease of formation of inner sphere complex to nanoadsorbent in case of pb ii ions the observed result was due to electrostatic interactions of positively charged pb ii with phosphate anion 59 the no3 2 so4 2 and cl anions showed similar decrease in percentage removal for both metal ions fig s8a b in the presence of co3 2 ions at high concentration the pb ii and as iii adsorption is declined due to the formation of arseno and lead carbonate complexes respectively 60 61 regeneration studies are vital for confirming reusability of spent adsorbent the removal efficiencies of pb ii and as iii slightly diminished after five adsorption desorption cycles fig 7b it still retained 85 adsorption efficiency for pb ii ions and 78 for as iii ions the reduction in adsorption potential of nanoadsorbent was due to loss of sample during each operation similar decline in adsorptive performance of fe3o4 sio2 go nanocomposites is reported 62 thus p go showed excellent stability and regeneration 4 conclusions doping of b and p atoms into go induced distinct morphological and structural changes in the go nanosheets b and p doped go had large surface area and defects as well as contained moieties of po 96 9 pc 3 1 c2bo cbo2 93 4 and bc 6 3 that contributed to their higher adsorptive performance than pristine go higher adsorptive potential of p go for pb ii ions qmax 388 8 mg g 1 and as iii ions qmax 157 4 mg g 1 as compared to b go could be ascribed to higher surface area 144 4 m2g 1 functional moieties and smaller particle size 80 nm pb ii adsorption was also favoured by its negative ξ potential however as iii adsorption was favoured by the formation of surface complexes of as oh 3 with po moieties p go has advantage over n go due to the presence of phosphorous containing functional moieties which aided the adsorption of as iii ions p go exhibited good reusability and reproducibility even after five adsorption desorption cycles 85 for pb ii ions 78 for as iii ions column studies revealed that the concentration of pb ii and as iii could be modulated within permissible limits by optimizing the number of cycles thus p doping is an effective strategy for tuning the properties of go as a nanoadsorbent credit authorship contribution statement manpreet kaur

12558,it is known that global drug resistance is increasing challenge at an alarming rate worldwide lansoprazole lpz is one of turkey s most prescribed anti ulcer drugs to treat acid related disorders turkey is the country with the highest drug resistance among oecd countries this paper presents a study on lpz s adsorption evaluation from aquatic media using a modified iron oxide fe3o4 which was synthesized with polyethyleneimine pei and polyoxymethylene sorbitan trioleate tween 85 the removal efficiency of the pei fe3o4 tween 85 reached 96 within 30 min at ph 8 even with 0 2 g adsorbent 90 lpz removal was achieved significant removal of lpz was observed after 1 min contact time this process indicates that the lpz adsorption is physical and demonstrates a thermodynamic behavior of an exothermic reaction pseudo second order kinetics revealed a reasonable regression value 0 99 that the model is best fitted the freundlich isotherm model well described equilibrium adsorption data the maximum adsorption capacity of lansoprazole was 131 06 mg g by the magnetite composite adsorbent experimental results demonstrate that this adsorbent possessed the advantages of superior adsorptive to the pei surface rapid synthesis and pore diameters in the range of 70 100 nm nanoscale after hydrophobic modification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lansoprazole removal magnetic nanoparticle tween 85 pei fe3o4 adsorption data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drugs have dramatically increased their presence in aqueous media through hospital discharges municipal wastewater and pharmaceutical industries disposal 1 these micropollutants cannot be effectively removed by conventional wastewater treatment 2 these pharmaceutical type compounds have potential high ecotoxicity in surface and groundwaters 3 today humanity is frighteningly and rapidly moving towards the antibacterial era thus multidrug resistance has seriously led to increased mortality of bacterial pathogens and therapy effectiveness worldwide 4 therefore interrupting drug resistance is crucial for active ingredients to remain an effective treatment option against bacterial infections in the future 5 the discharge of pharmaceuticals into the environment through different routes 6 how a pharmaceutical drug s active ingredients are released into the environment and their ecological cycle is shown schematically in fig 1 to slow down the development of resistance who the world health organization has encouraged the whole world to act and take responsibility for the issue 7 the strategic and technical advisory group stag s who regional office workshop on antimicrobial resistance was held at the university of antwerp in 2013 a data network started to be established with non eu european united countries this antimicrobial medicines consumption amc network includes the central asian and eastern european surveillance of antimicrobial resistance caesar consisting of 53 countries within and outside the e u like turkey 8 did is the defined daily dose value per 1000 people in 1 day the graphical distribution of did values showing the worldwide drug consumption situation is given in fig 2 as seen in fig 2 among 40 countries iran ranked first with 38 78 did turkey ranked second with 38 18 did and sudan ranked third with 35 29 did 9 the two main antimicrobial management programs established by the ministry of health in turkey are national hospital antimicrobial restriction program narp and national action rational drug use plan nardup 11 turkey is following these basic microbial resistance management programs as a candidate country for a member of the european union regarding health targets by the ministry of health according to the latest annual surveillance reports turkey s consumption value of antimicrobial drugs was 35 29 dids in 2018 12 according to this consumption data turkey is the country with the highest antimicrobial resistance among oecd countries consumption data of some drug active ingredients in turkey are given in table 1 in turkey lansoprazole is the most used drug api belonging to the proton pump inhibitor ppis group the daily consumption dose of this stomach preventing and the ulcer therapeutic drug was 89 381 197 nddd the daily dose in the pack in turkey in 2018 besides this high dose it involves high risk due to its high ec50 lc50 ratio 168 55 and high pec pnec ratio 238 2 for turkey according to the ecotoxicological environmental risk assessment parameters aqua matrix 9 therefore it is predicted that these pharmaceutical groups may dominate our country s wastewater the two dimensional representation and chemical structure of lansoprazole is demonstrated in fig 3 conventional treatment plants mostly cannot remove antibiotics efficiently 13 for these reasons many advanced technologies used in the treatment of pharmaceuticals include electrochemical degradation 14 advanced oxidation processes 15 17 photocatalysis 18 19 ozonation 20 and adsorption 21 24 alternative removal by low cost adsorbents for potable water treatment and purification however its applications are still on a pilot and laboratory scale it is frequently used in countries with insufficiently advanced technologies and capital 25 in most existing studies the commonly studied adsorbents are nanocomposite magnetite materials 26 28 carbon based materials 29 30 and biosorbents 31 32 fe3o4 are ferrimagnets produced by chemical reactions these adsorbents potentially effective for antibiotics and other drugs can be used to remove them from the aquatic media it also has low toxicity and is easy to produce 33 polyethyleneimine pei gel coater is a synthetic cationic polymer commonly used as a coating reagent 34 it is highly suitable for bonding with the weak anionic surface of antibiotics 35 36 glutaraldehyde ga c5h8o2 is used as a crosslinking and fixing agent to create chemical covalent conjunction between different components it is an active compound in acidic and basic environments 37 polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate tween 85 is a non ionic surfactant that biodegrades faster than anionic surfactants in an aqueous 38 it is ensured that the nanomaterial produced with tween 85 has substantial synergistic effects and the material s molecules increase the carrying capacity 39 this study investigated the synthesized pei fe3o4 tween 85 magnetite nanoparticles and the effects of their physical and chemical properties on lpz s treatments there are no studies on removing this active substance with adsorption from aqueous except in chemical nanosensors studies the focus is to report a high lpz removal capacity with as little as a 0 2 g adsorbent dose from the aquatic media the tween 85 pei fe3o4 exhibits a super high lpz adsorption capacity at a low innovative adsorbent dose in the present study the results will provide a better understanding of the removal mechanism of drugs with a low cost and low dose innovative adsorbent in other words in this study high removal efficiency was obtained at low contact times with a very low adsorbent amount the low amount of adsorbent and contact time can make the adsorption process economical in addition the obtained adsorbent was not previously available in the literature and can be tested with different types of organic pollutants 2 material and methods lansoprazole with 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich the lpz c16h14f3n3o2s was prepared from the stock solution to the desired

aldrich merck usa carlo erba italy gündüz kimya turkey the sample analysis was done using spectrophotometric methods 40 nanoparticulate was characterized in terms of morphology and absorbance of the residual concentrations of lansoprazole λmax 281 nm the devices used in the characterization are an emission scanning microscope fesem jsm it300la and a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach co usa the zero point charge phzpc of the tween 85 pei fe3o4 was measured using the ph drift method 36 2 1 synthesis of iron oxide fe3o4 magnetite particles fe3o4 was synthesized by using a strong reducing reagent nh3 the redox reaction was based on nh3 fusing with 0 2 m fecl3 and 0 1 m nh4 2fe so4 2 in distilled water for 45 min at 90 c 41 nh3 was diluted to 25 and prepared was immediately added to the solution tween 85 1 v v was added and heated for 60 min at 90 c until a black precipitate formed finally the formed particles were dried at 50 c for 12 h in a drying oven and eventually powdered using a grinding machine in the powdered step 36 2 2 making the fe3o4 tween 85 suitable for surface modification in the experiment a crosslinking agent was used for lateral crosslinks the mixture of pei and fe3o4 1 2 and 1 4 ratios was left in daylight at room temperature for 48 h before the modification then 0 5 wt ethanoic acetic acid was added to 20 ml 50 dilute ga solution for surface activation and stirred for 4 h on a magnetite stirrer pei 2 g ga 9 ml ethanoic acid 8 ml fig 4 2 3 the synthesis of tween 85 pei fe3o4 the modification and coating processes were carried out at this stage after adding a mixture of pei and fe3o4 to the solution it was mixed in multiple mixers at 300 rpm for 2 h in a flask the mixture was treated in an ultrasonic bath at 60 c for 15 min in the last step remove excess ga and ethanoic acid from the material s surface the part that did not participate in the modification after washing it several times with deionized water the modified material was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 c for two days the innovative adsorbent with and without tween 85 was synthesized with the same method as four fractions 1 4 fe3o4 pei 1 2 fe3o4 pei material properties and removal performances were evaluated with varying fe3o4 and pei ratios in preliminary studies it was decided that the best material was 1 2 fe3o4 pei 2 4 adsorption experiments 0 2 g of synthesized adsorbent was added to 10 mg l lpz solutions with a final volume of 50 ml the mixture was mixed in a heated mixer at 25 c at a constant speed of 250 rpm for 120 min it has been studied in the ph range of 2 10

ce and ct represent the pollutant concentration at initial equilibrium and time t respectively mg l r is the removal efficiency and v is the solution volume l 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization ftir spectra of adsorbents at different modification rates are shown in fig 5 as can be seen in fig 6 the functional groups formed in the materials and their numbers are different the bands observed in the characteristic range of 3800 2700 cm 1 are attributed to the aliphatic effect ch and nh stretching vibrations of groups for pei ga and tween 85 ch3 and ch2 appeared at 2845 2927 and 3333 cm 1 in this figure respectively the characteristic peaks observed at 2260 2150 cm 1 are assigned to the c c and c n σ π covalent bonding the peaks followed in the range of 1705 1730 cm 1 are assigned as the ester group s co stretching which is included in the hydrophilic partition of tween 85 the observed bands that appeared at 1244 195 cm 1 are assigned as the cn stretching of pei when spectra were examined different new peaks were observed on 1 2 fe3o4 tween 85 pei these peaks show that the tween and the adsorbent make a chemical bond the modified adsorbent can be used to efficiently remove lpz 96 from the aqueous the sem image of materials modified by the pei and tween 85 is shown in fig 6 the morphological characteristics of the 1 2 rate with tween 85 changed after coating with pei fe3o4 nanoparticles the changes after coating in the peak shape for the other rates and where peak shifts occurred were confirmed by the results of the ftir spectrum 3 2 zero charging point since water molecules are held weakly at the zero charge potential point 42 which can change with properties such as the chemical structure and amount of the adsorbent micropollutant molecules adhere more tightly and more to the adsorbent surface for this purpose a zero charge potential point 43 was found in different ph environments to determine at which ph the maximum adsorption occurs the measurements in fig 7 showed at which ph point the adsorbent surface is uncharged zero charge point and in which ph range it is negative or positive according to the results obtained in the experiment ph 4 9 shows the best adsorption performance 3 3 dls analysis result in dls analysis it was determined that the particle size of the innovative adsorbent 1 2 tween 85 pei fe3o4 samples with the best performance was in the range of 70 100 nm with the result obtained it has been proven that the innovative adsorbent is a nano sized material the results obtained are given in fig 8 3 4 application of adsorption experimental data in different isotherm models langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are widely used for modeling adsorption equilibrium data langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms studied of equilibrium sorption of lpz on the synthesized innovative adsorbent according to the results the freundlich isotherm with a higher r2 value can be more explanative in fitting the data of lpz adsorption on 1 2 pei fe3o4 with tween fig 9 freundlich characteristic coefficient kf l g and n are an indicator of adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity while langmuir constant kl represents affinity also qm represents the maximum monolayer capacity of the adsorbent mg g the temkin isotherm considers adsorbent adsorbate interactions kt l mg represents adsorption potential and bt is related to the heat of adsorption for the temkin isotherm model according to the calculated coefficient n 1 kt exhibited a small value can be interpreted as the innovative material is suitable for adsorption and adsorption is physical isotherm model coefficients are given in table 2 3 5 statistical verification of isotherms r2 is the most used as indicative of model fittingness for adsorption kinetic data it does not guarantee that model adequacy though therefore different statistical verification methods are needed different statistical validation methods were used in this study each of these validation methods tests for model errors statistical values were calculated for lpz as shown in table 3 these mathematical equations which are a measure of the applicability of the adsorption process can be used in the optimization of statistical experimental design methods these validation methods are an indication of how low the model error is thus the theoretical isotherms calculated from the isotherm equations for the adsorption process were compared with the experimental isotherms 3 6 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics adsorption kinetics which determines the time until the adsorption equilibrium is established is closely related to the contact time 44 the adsorption steps of the pollutant in the solution are diffusion towards the boundary of the film layer boundary layer diffusion adsorbent internal pore diffusion intraparticle diffusion and adhesion various kinetic models have been developed to describe the adsorption reaction patterns lagergren s pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models are the most widely used models characterizing adsorption kinetics in aqueous solutions 45 lagergren s reaction kinetic model equations are given in table 4 the k1ad and k2ad values were calculated from the kinetic model graphs the kinetic coefficients calculated with the graphs obtained the correlations of the kinetic coefficients and the amount of drug active substance removed are as in fig 10 using the calculated coefficients the qe values and the experimental qe values were plotted and the correlation between them was examined in the direction of the obtained data according to the results obtained lpz adsorption kinetics better fits the pseudo second order model to find out whether the adsorption process develops spontaneously or not δg δh and δs values were calculated using the equations in table 5 the δg δh and δs values at different temperatures for lpz are given in table 5 the enthalpy results of this process can be explained by according to the results obtained δh and δs values were negative according to these results it is thought that the adsorption is physical and the entropy of the system decreases the positive value correspondences of δg values indicate the temperatures at which adsorption cannot occur spontaneously 3 7 effects of physicochemical properties of tween 85 pei fe3o4 on lpz adsorption the effect of ph lpz dosage contact time adsorbent amount and temperature would cause a decrease or increase in hydrophobicity aromaticity and molecular size features of the adsorbent 46 evaluating experimental results and assessing of physical and chemical parameters of the adsorption process were reported in this section the effect of ph on the adsorption of lpz a weak base onto tween 85 pei fe3o4 was investigated by using various sets of the experiment the best result 96 was achieved in alkaline ph 8 the results show that the adsorption capacity of this magnetite adsorbent reached its lowest level at ph 4 fig 11b when the ph of the solution exceeds the zero charge point of the adsorbent ph 4 9 tween 85 pei fe3o4surface starts to protonate with h content and high lipophilic π 1 44 trifluoromethyl group cf3 aliphatic bond effect on lpz the removal efficiency begins to increase thus the hydrophobic adsorbent attracts the hydrophilic lpz molecule to itself with an electrostatic effect herein the high electron donating asymmetric sulfinyl group s o on lpz can support selective removal by passivating the lone ions around it 47 lpz r1 ch3 r2 ch2cf3 r3 and r4 h pka 8 8 contains functional aliphatic ch2 3 and aromatic acidic groups carboxyl cooh amine nh2 halide x hydroxyl oh 48 49 a high pka value indicates a high desire for ionization degree of protonation for π π psychochemical interactions on the adsorbent the π π electron donor acceptor eda interaction is the main factor explaining the adsorption of phenolics in many adsorbents 50 articles showing the significant effect of the π π eda interaction on adsorption 51 the π π eda interaction is enhanced by the electron donating effect between the electron poor regions in tween 85 pei fe3o4 and the electron rich ring structures of lpz tween 85 pei fe3o4 polarizable moieties play an amphoteric role against adsorbates and can perform π electron donating and π electron withdrawal functions simultaneously therefore it is thought that π π interaction will be effective in adsorption the adsorption studies were carried out with batch experiments by setting the initial concentration of lpz to 10 mg l in this study the influence of ph 2 8 and adsorbent dose 0 025 0 05 0 1and 0 2 g contact time 1 120 min mixing rate 100 300 rpm the temperature 298 313 k was tested using uv vis spectrophotometry data fig 11 these experimental data are interpreted according to obtained results the lpz removal efficiency increased abruptly when the adsorbent dose increased from 0 025 g to 0 05 g for the maximum monolayer saturated adsorption besides it was observed that the rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased when the surface active sides reached saturation due to the diffusion resistance of the inner pores of the adsorbent fig 11 illustrates that the best adsorption efficiency occurred at ph 8 and room temperature 303 k with a speed of 250 rpm for a 0 2 g adsorbent however adsorption efficiency suddenly decreased significantly due to decomposing effect of temperature it is considered for lpz organic micropollutant adsorption on the modified magnetite adsorbent surface the van der waals forces and π π stacking interactions played an important role in the mechanism also the aromatic organic content of lpz has promoted a tendency the move away from water and remove 36 the reason for the calculation of validation values was to reflect the physical conditions better while evaluating the suitability of isotherm models the calculated values that were low for freundlich and langmuir values indicate that these isotherms can be more explanative than temkin in fitting lpz s data adsorption on 1 2 tween 85 pei fe3o4 this is because the limiting parameter is not temperature in table 6 the innovative nanoparticle removal capacities produced with the materials used for the removal of drug active substances in the literature are compared in addition in this study the lpz removal result with the real wastewater sample was also examined in this connection the lpz analysis was carried out from the kayseri water and sewerage administration general directorate kaski̇ advanced biological wastewater treatment plant the secondary settling tank effluent consequently 76 lpz removal was obtained in the batch experiment performed under the optimum conditions specified the reason why the removal efficiency of lpz in wastewater 76 is lower than in aqueous solution 96 is that the other organic pollutants in wastewater include the adsorption process and decrease the lpz adsorption efficiency the physicochemical properties of wastewater were given in our previous article 36 4 conclusion in this paper we reported lpz on which no adsorption studies have been performed from aqueous media with a successfully synthesized innovative nanoparticle adsorbent considering its low cost and could be a promising adsorbent for drug treatment from contaminated water overall the main findings can be summarized as follows first this study found a local did value for turkey to guide drug resistance reports in this study we have obtained new experimental results i innovative magnetite iron based adsorbent tween 85 pei fe3o4 coated pei and tween 85 achieved great lpz removal efficiency 96 and this material appropriate materials removal of

12558,it is known that global drug resistance is increasing challenge at an alarming rate worldwide lansoprazole lpz is one of turkey s most prescribed anti ulcer drugs to treat acid related disorders turkey is the country with the highest drug resistance among oecd countries this paper presents a study on lpz s adsorption evaluation from aquatic media using a modified iron oxide fe3o4 which was synthesized with polyethyleneimine pei and polyoxymethylene sorbitan trioleate tween 85 the removal efficiency of the pei fe3o4 tween 85 reached 96 within 30 min at ph 8 even with 0 2 g adsorbent 90 lpz removal was achieved significant removal of lpz was observed after 1 min contact time this process indicates that the lpz adsorption is physical and demonstrates a thermodynamic behavior of an exothermic reaction pseudo second order kinetics revealed a reasonable regression value 0 99 that the model is best fitted the freundlich isotherm model well described equilibrium adsorption data the maximum adsorption capacity of lansoprazole was 131 06 mg g by the magnetite composite adsorbent experimental results demonstrate that this adsorbent possessed the advantages of superior adsorptive to the pei surface rapid synthesis and pore diameters in the range of 70 100 nm nanoscale after hydrophobic modification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lansoprazole removal magnetic nanoparticle tween 85 pei fe3o4 adsorption data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction drugs have dramatically increased their presence in aqueous media through hospital discharges municipal wastewater and pharmaceutical industries disposal 1 these micropollutants cannot be effectively removed by conventional wastewater treatment 2 these pharmaceutical type compounds have potential high ecotoxicity in surface and groundwaters 3 today humanity is frighteningly and rapidly moving towards the antibacterial era thus multidrug resistance has seriously led to increased mortality of bacterial pathogens and therapy effectiveness worldwide 4 therefore interrupting drug resistance is crucial for active ingredients to remain an effective treatment option against bacterial infections in the future 5 the discharge of pharmaceuticals into the environment through different routes 6 how a pharmaceutical drug s active ingredients are released into the environment and their ecological cycle is shown schematically in fig 1 to slow down the development of resistance who the world health organization has encouraged the whole world to act and take responsibility for the issue 7 the strategic and technical advisory group stag s who regional office workshop on antimicrobial resistance was held at the university of antwerp in 2013 a data network started to be established with non eu european united countries this antimicrobial medicines consumption amc network includes the central asian and eastern european surveillance of antimicrobial resistance caesar consisting of 53 countries within and outside the e u like turkey 8 did is the defined daily dose value per 1000 people in 1 day the graphical distribution of did values showing the worldwide drug consumption situation is given in fig 2 as seen in fig 2 among 40 countries iran ranked first with 38 78 did turkey ranked second with 38 18 did and sudan ranked third with 35 29 did 9 the two main antimicrobial management programs established by the ministry of health in turkey are national hospital antimicrobial restriction program narp and national action rational drug use plan nardup 11 turkey is following these basic microbial resistance management programs as a candidate country for a member of the european union regarding health targets by the ministry of health according to the latest annual surveillance reports turkey s consumption value of antimicrobial drugs was 35 29 dids in 2018 12 according to this consumption data turkey is the country with the highest antimicrobial resistance among oecd countries consumption data of some drug active ingredients in turkey are given in table 1 in turkey lansoprazole is the most used drug api belonging to the proton pump inhibitor ppis group the daily consumption dose of this stomach preventing and the ulcer therapeutic drug was 89 381 197 nddd the daily dose in the pack in turkey in 2018 besides this high dose it involves high risk due to its high ec50 lc50 ratio 168 55 and high pec pnec ratio 238 2 for turkey according to the ecotoxicological environmental risk assessment parameters aqua matrix 9 therefore it is predicted that these pharmaceutical groups may dominate our country s wastewater the two dimensional representation and chemical structure of lansoprazole is demonstrated in fig 3 conventional treatment plants mostly cannot remove antibiotics efficiently 13 for these reasons many advanced technologies used in the treatment of pharmaceuticals include electrochemical degradation 14 advanced oxidation processes 15 17 photocatalysis 18 19 ozonation 20 and adsorption 21 24 alternative removal by low cost adsorbents for potable water treatment and purification however its applications are still on a pilot and laboratory scale it is frequently used in countries with insufficiently advanced technologies and capital 25 in most existing studies the commonly studied adsorbents are nanocomposite magnetite materials 26 28 carbon based materials 29 30 and biosorbents 31 32 fe3o4 are ferrimagnets produced by chemical reactions these adsorbents potentially effective for antibiotics and other drugs can be used to remove them from the aquatic media it also has low toxicity and is easy to produce 33 polyethyleneimine pei gel coater is a synthetic cationic polymer commonly used as a coating reagent 34 it is highly suitable for bonding with the weak anionic surface of antibiotics 35 36 glutaraldehyde ga c5h8o2 is used as a crosslinking and fixing agent to create chemical covalent conjunction between different components it is an active compound in acidic and basic environments 37 polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate tween 85 is a non ionic surfactant that biodegrades faster than anionic surfactants in an aqueous 38 it is ensured that the nanomaterial produced with tween 85 has substantial synergistic effects and the material s molecules increase the carrying capacity 39 this study investigated the synthesized pei fe3o4 tween 85 magnetite nanoparticles and the effects of their physical and chemical properties on lpz s treatments there are no studies on removing this active substance with adsorption from aqueous except in chemical nanosensors studies the focus is to report a high lpz removal capacity with as little as a 0 2 g adsorbent dose from the aquatic media the tween 85 pei fe3o4 exhibits a super high lpz adsorption capacity at a low innovative adsorbent dose in the present study the results will provide a better understanding of the removal mechanism of drugs with a low cost and low dose innovative adsorbent in other words in this study high removal efficiency was obtained at low contact times with a very low adsorbent amount the low amount of adsorbent and contact time can make the adsorption process economical in addition the obtained adsorbent was not previously available in the literature and can be tested with different types of organic pollutants 2 material and methods lansoprazole with 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich the lpz c16h14f3n3o2s was prepared from the stock solution to the desired

residual concentrations of lansoprazole λmax 281 nm the devices used in the characterization are an emission scanning microscope fesem jsm it300la and a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach co usa the zero point charge phzpc of the tween 85 pei fe3o4 was measured using the ph drift method 36 2 1 synthesis of iron oxide fe3o4 magnetite particles fe3o4 was synthesized by using a strong reducing reagent nh3 the redox reaction was based on nh3 fusing with 0 2 m fecl3 and 0 1 m nh4 2fe so4 2 in distilled water for 45 min at 90 c 41 nh3 was diluted to 25 and prepared was immediately added to the solution tween 85 1 v v was added and heated for 60 min at 90 c until a black precipitate formed finally the formed particles were dried at 50 c for 12 h in a drying oven and eventually powdered using a grinding machine in the powdered step 36 2 2 making the fe3o4 tween 85 suitable for surface modification in the experiment a crosslinking agent was used for lateral crosslinks the mixture of pei and fe3o4 1 2 and 1 4 ratios was left in daylight at room temperature for 48 h before the modification then 0 5 wt ethanoic acetic acid was added to 20 ml 50 dilute ga solution for surface activation and stirred for 4 h on a magnetite stirrer pei 2 g ga 9 ml ethanoic acid 8 ml fig 4 2 3 the synthesis of tween 85 pei fe3o4 the modification and coating processes were carried out at this stage after adding a mixture of pei and fe3o4 to the solution it was mixed in multiple mixers at 300 rpm for 2 h in a flask the mixture was treated in an ultrasonic bath at 60 c for 15 min in the last step remove excess ga and ethanoic acid from the material s surface the part that did not participate in the modification after washing it several times with deionized water the modified material was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 c for two days the innovative adsorbent with and without tween 85 was synthesized with the same method as four fractions 1 4 fe3o4 pei 1 2 fe3o4 pei material properties and removal performances were evaluated with varying fe3o4 and pei ratios in preliminary studies it was decided that the best material was 1 2 fe3o4 pei 2 4 adsorption experiments 0 2 g of synthesized adsorbent was added to 10 mg l lpz solutions with a final volume of 50 ml the mixture was mixed in a heated mixer at 25 c at a constant speed of 250 rpm for 120 min it has been studied in the ph range of 2 10 for the active drug after passing through a 0 45 μm pore diameter pvdf filter analysis was made with a uv vis spectrophotometer using the equations given in eqs 1 and 2 the adsorption capacities at

ce and ct represent the pollutant concentration at initial equilibrium and time t respectively mg l r is the removal efficiency and v is the solution volume l 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization ftir spectra of adsorbents at different modification rates are shown in fig 5 as can be seen in fig 6 the functional groups formed in the materials and their numbers are different the bands observed in the characteristic range of 3800 2700 cm 1 are attributed to the aliphatic effect ch and nh stretching vibrations of groups for pei ga and tween 85 ch3 and ch2 appeared at 2845 2927 and 3333 cm 1 in this figure respectively the characteristic peaks observed at 2260 2150 cm 1 are assigned to the c c and c n σ π covalent bonding the peaks followed in the range of 1705 1730 cm 1 are assigned as the ester group s co stretching which is included in the hydrophilic partition of tween 85 the observed bands that appeared at 1244 195 cm 1 are assigned as the cn stretching of pei when spectra were examined different new peaks were observed on 1 2 fe3o4 tween 85 pei these peaks show that the tween and the adsorbent make a chemical bond the modified adsorbent can be used to efficiently remove lpz 96 from the aqueous the sem image of materials modified by the pei and tween 85 is shown in fig 6 the morphological characteristics of the 1 2 rate with tween 85 changed after coating with pei fe3o4 nanoparticles the changes after coating in the peak shape for the other rates and where peak shifts occurred were confirmed by the results of the ftir spectrum 3 2 zero charging point since water molecules are held weakly at the zero charge potential point 42 which can change with properties such as the chemical structure and amount of the adsorbent micropollutant molecules adhere more tightly and more to the adsorbent surface for this purpose a zero charge potential point 43 was found in different ph environments to determine at which ph the maximum adsorption occurs the measurements in fig 7 showed at which ph point the adsorbent surface is uncharged zero charge point and in which ph range it is negative or positive according to the results obtained in the experiment ph 4 9 shows the best adsorption performance 3 3 dls analysis result in dls analysis it was determined that the particle size of the innovative adsorbent 1 2 tween 85 pei fe3o4 samples with the best performance was in the range of 70 100 nm with the result obtained it has been proven that the innovative adsorbent is a nano sized material the results obtained are given in fig 8 3 4 application of adsorption experimental data in different isotherm models langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are widely used for modeling adsorption equilibrium data langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms studied of equilibrium sorption of lpz on the synthesized innovative adsorbent according to the results the freundlich isotherm with a higher r2 value can be more explanative in fitting the data of lpz adsorption on 1 2 pei fe3o4 with tween fig 9 freundlich characteristic coefficient kf l g and n are an indicator of adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity while langmuir constant kl represents affinity also qm represents the maximum monolayer capacity of the adsorbent mg g the temkin isotherm considers adsorbent adsorbate interactions kt l mg represents adsorption potential and bt is related to the heat of adsorption for the temkin isotherm model according to the calculated coefficient n 1 kt exhibited a small value can be interpreted as the innovative material is suitable for adsorption and adsorption is physical isotherm model coefficients are given in table 2 3 5 statistical verification of isotherms r2 is the most used as indicative of model fittingness for adsorption kinetic data it does not guarantee that model adequacy though therefore different statistical verification methods are needed different statistical validation methods were used in this study each of these validation methods tests for model errors statistical values were calculated for lpz as shown in table 3 these mathematical equations which are a measure of the applicability of the adsorption process can be used in the optimization of statistical experimental design methods these validation methods are an indication of how low the model error is thus the theoretical isotherms calculated from the isotherm equations for the adsorption process were compared with the experimental isotherms 3 6 adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics adsorption kinetics which determines the time until the adsorption equilibrium is established is closely related to the contact time 44 the adsorption steps of the pollutant in the solution are diffusion towards the boundary of the film layer boundary layer diffusion adsorbent internal pore diffusion intraparticle diffusion and adhesion various kinetic models have been developed to describe the adsorption reaction patterns lagergren s pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models are the most widely used models characterizing adsorption kinetics in aqueous solutions 45 lagergren s reaction kinetic model equations are given in table 4 the k1ad and k2ad values were calculated from the kinetic model graphs the kinetic coefficients calculated with the graphs obtained the correlations of the kinetic coefficients and the amount of drug active substance removed are as in fig 10 using the calculated coefficients the qe values and the experimental qe values were plotted and the correlation between them was examined in the direction of the obtained data according to the results obtained lpz adsorption kinetics better fits the pseudo second order model to find out whether the adsorption process develops spontaneously or not δg δh and δs values were calculated using the equations in table 5 the δg δh and δs values at different temperatures for lpz are given in table 5 the enthalpy results of this process can be explained by according to the results obtained δh and δs values were negative according to these results it is thought that the adsorption is physical and the entropy of the system decreases the positive value correspondences of δg values indicate the temperatures at which adsorption cannot occur spontaneously 3 7 effects of physicochemical properties of tween 85 pei fe3o4 on lpz adsorption the effect of ph lpz dosage contact time adsorbent amount and temperature would cause a decrease or increase in hydrophobicity aromaticity and molecular size features of the adsorbent 46 evaluating experimental results and assessing of physical and chemical parameters of the adsorption process were reported in this section the effect of ph on the adsorption of lpz a weak base onto tween 85 pei fe3o4 was investigated by using various sets of the experiment the best result 96 was achieved in alkaline ph 8 the results show that the adsorption capacity of this magnetite adsorbent reached its lowest level at ph 4 fig 11b when the ph of the solution exceeds the zero charge point of the adsorbent ph 4 9 tween 85 pei fe3o4surface starts to protonate with h content and high lipophilic π 1 44 trifluoromethyl group cf3 aliphatic bond effect on lpz the removal efficiency begins to increase thus the hydrophobic adsorbent attracts the hydrophilic lpz molecule to itself with an electrostatic effect herein the high electron donating asymmetric sulfinyl group s o on lpz can support selective removal by passivating the lone ions around it 47 lpz r1 ch3 r2 ch2cf3 r3 and r4 h pka 8 8 contains functional aliphatic ch2 3 and aromatic acidic groups carboxyl cooh amine nh2 halide x hydroxyl oh 48 49 a high pka value indicates a high desire for ionization degree of protonation for π π psychochemical interactions on the adsorbent the π π electron donor acceptor eda interaction is the main factor explaining the adsorption of phenolics in many adsorbents 50 articles showing the significant effect of the π π eda interaction on adsorption 51 the π π eda interaction is enhanced by the electron donating effect between the electron poor regions in tween 85 pei fe3o4 and the electron rich ring structures of lpz tween 85 pei fe3o4 polarizable moieties play an amphoteric role against adsorbates and can perform π electron donating and π electron withdrawal functions simultaneously therefore it is thought that π π interaction will be effective in adsorption the adsorption studies were carried out with batch experiments by setting the initial concentration of lpz to 10 mg l in this study the influence of ph 2 8 and adsorbent dose 0 025 0 05 0 1and 0 2 g contact time 1 120 min mixing rate 100 300 rpm the temperature 298 313 k was tested using uv vis spectrophotometry data fig 11 these experimental data are interpreted according to obtained results the lpz removal efficiency increased abruptly when the adsorbent dose increased from 0 025 g to 0 05 g for the maximum monolayer saturated adsorption besides it was observed that the rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased when the surface active sides reached saturation due to the diffusion resistance of the inner pores of the adsorbent fig 11 illustrates that the best adsorption efficiency occurred at ph 8 and room temperature 303 k with a speed of 250 rpm for a 0 2 g adsorbent however adsorption efficiency suddenly decreased significantly due to decomposing effect of temperature it is considered for lpz organic micropollutant adsorption on the modified magnetite adsorbent surface the van der waals forces and π π stacking interactions played an important role in the mechanism also the aromatic organic content of lpz has promoted a tendency the move away from water and remove 36 the reason for the calculation of validation values was to reflect the physical conditions better while evaluating the suitability of isotherm models the calculated values that were low for freundlich and langmuir values indicate that these isotherms can be more explanative than temkin in fitting lpz s data adsorption on 1 2 tween 85 pei fe3o4 this is because the limiting parameter is not

12559,a packed bed direct contact dehumidifier pb dcd has been developed to selectively condense water from a gaseous mixture of organic contaminants in this process hot air is humidified by mixing with wastewater vapor in a static mixer and is dehumidified by subcooled fresh water passing through the pb dcd in a counter current configuration the goal of this study is to understand the relationship between various operating parameters and how they affect separation of isopropyl alcohol ipa from the gaseous mixture with the purpose of expanding the investigation to other contaminants in the future the process has been successfully used to separate ipa from wastewater different parameters including the concentration of ipa in water feed temperature air to vapor ratio and cooling water to vapor mass ratio as well as residence time were examined to determine their influence on contaminant separation and clean water recovery rate the buckingham pi theorem was applied to reduce the number of studying variables by generating non dimensional groups experiments were performed to determine the relationship between the non dimensional parameters and model mass transfer in the system mass transfer coefficients for multicomponent gaseous mixture condensation in a packed bed direct contact condenser column are calculated and a modified correlation of mass transfer is developed the parameters of the mass transfer model are obtained from operating conditions of the pb dcd stream conditions and thermodynamic properties a modified sherwood correlation is developed to predict ipa separation from a gaseous mixture consisting of air water and ipa the modified sherwood correlation is applied to successfully predict the sherwood number with a mean absolute error equal

voc volatile organic compound us united states 1 introduction in the past few decades rapid development in the oil and gas industry has contributed significantly to energy security but also led to the production of large amounts of contaminated water produced water is the largest volume by product of the oil and gas extraction industry the volume of produced water generated in the united states us is estimated to be more than 2 4 billion m3 each year 1 hydraulic fracturing or fracking is one of the methods for extracting oil and natural gas from deep in the earth whose extraction process typically requires from 7000 to 21 000 m3 of fresh water per well the largest by product of hydraulic fracturing is wastewater 2 according to a federal reserve report unconventional wells can produce flowback volumes ranging between 1000 and 10 000 m3 during the initial flowback process 3 unfortunately fracking wastewater contains numerous contaminants including toxic compounds therefore discharging it into the environment may contaminate surface waters including potential sources of drinking and irrigation water 4 air quality can also be affected due to evaporation of volatile chemicals from wastewater one commonly used solution to these problems is underground injection in the us there are approximately 180 000 class ii wells these wells are used to inject brines and fluids associated with oil and gas production in operation about 20 of oil and gas related injection wells are from brines and hydraulic fracturing wastewater separated hydrocarbons from such brines are also disposed of in these such wells in the us an estimated of 9 million m3 of fluid are estimated to be injected into these types of wells per day 5 the volume of produced water disposed by underground injection is decreasing however according to data from 2007 98 of the total produced water from shale gas industry was managed by underground injection 6 in texas there were about 35 000 class ii injection wells and 1152 specifically permitted for oil and gas waste as of 2014 7 in a 2012 study of waste from the marcellus shale it was concluded that 26 6 of produced brine was disposed of through deep well injection of this 280 000 m3 of produced water 5600 m3 of drilling fluids and 16 700 m3 of flowback were disposed of by deep well injection 8 in west virginia at least 180 000 m3 of wastewater were injected between 2002 and 2014 from various unconventional oil and gas wells 9 underground injection is a technique that requires properly constructed wells poor construction can cause diffusion of contaminants into freshwater reservoirs accordingly it is important to treat such contaminated water or at least separate toxic chemicals from wastewater before discharging it into the environment thermal separation techniques are suitable methods for treating produced water because they can be integrated with low grade energy and waste heat available at oil extraction sites 10 11 humidification dehumidification is one of these techniques that has proven to be an effective method for water desalination 12 it also has been used for the desalination of produced water 13 in this study humidification dehumidification is used in a water purification process 14 for treatment of a multicomponent wastewater a packed bed direct contact dehumidifier pb dcd has been designed for this purpose and fabricated to separate organic contaminants from wastewater the pb dcd is a key component of a novel treatment technology scepter 14 which is a freshwater recovery system for hydraulic fracturing in the humidification section of the process wastewater is vaporized in an evaporator it then mixes with hot air in a static mixing chamber next the vapor mixture enters the dehumidification section which is equipped with a direct contact condenser dcc to maximize heat recovery from fluid streams the direct contact dehumidifier is a vertical column filled with structured packing materials wherein cooling water is distributed from the top and the gaseous mixture enters from the bottom there are previous studies 15 18 on modeling a humidification dehumidification system equipped with a direct contact dehumidifier these studies have accomplished parametric analysis or modeling of the system based on heat and mass transfer li et al 19 developed a two fluid model using one dimensional mass and energy conservation equations for a packed bed direct contact condenser their analytical model was successful in predicting the thermal performance of the hdh including temperature variation humidity and condensation rate through each stage of the condenser however since their model is developed for condensation of water vapor out of an air vapor mixture it is not applicable for a multicomponent mixture he et al 18 proposed an hdh desalination system using waste heat through plate heat exchangers they developed a mathematical model based on equations of mass and energy to evaluate the performance of the hdh by calculating parameters such as clean water production versus different operating condition their study indicates that using a direct contact dehumidifier has great advantages compared with the traditional hdh saeed et al 16 performed experiments to test the performance of an hdh system with dcd under various operating conditions to explore the influence of temperatures and mass flowrates of seawater and freshwater on performance efficiency also they used non dimensional parameters to investigate optimum working conditions that maximize the freshwater production rate they showed that by reducing the seawater to freshwater mass flowrate ratio and increasing the temperature of seawater entering the humidifier recovery rate of direct contact dehumidifier increases according to their study liquid to gas flowrate ratio highly affects the effectiveness of the dehumidifier however since their model does not include mass transfer of components it is not applicable for characterizing the system utilized in this research in general the above studies focus on steam only air steam flows or desalination none of them investigate a multicomponent gaseous mixture condensation in a humidification dehumidification system 20 for a mixture vapor liquid equilibrium vle is a quantitative description of how each component is distributed in each phase at a specific temperature and pressure for binary mixtures vle is represented by bubble point and dew point curves there are many studies that deal with prediction methods for condensation of ternary vapor mixtures 21 however published vle data or models for multicomponent fluid mixtures are very limited 22 megan et al 22 developed a technique based on the advanced distillation curve adc to measure the phase equilibrium of multicomponent fluid mixtures however their model is not suitable for a gaseous mixture as they did not consider the effect of non condensable gas krishna and panchal 23 used a film model for multicomponent mass transfer based on an exact solution to the maxwell stefan equation to analyze the condensation of a binary vapor mixture in the presence of a non condensable gas their mathematical analysis only considered condensation in a vertical tube it did not investigate effects of a packed bed on fluid streams in another study jeremie et al 24 studied the condensation of a binary mixture in the presence of a non condensable gas however their study was only from a heat transfer point of view kotake 25 studied the effects of a small amount of non condensable gas on film condensation of a binary vapor mixture he used a perturbation method to solve mass transfer and phase equilibrium equations at the liquid vapor interface an experimental study of condensation of a hydrocarbon in the presence of a non condensable gas was conducted by gu et al 26 to investigate the heat and mass transfer mechanism there are many other studies for condensation of vapor mixtures with or without non condensable gas however these models and their mass and heat transfer analogies are usually developed based on film condensation in the case of packed columns with a counter current direct contact configuration correlations are required to determine heat and mass transfer coefficients in particular researchers have suggested that published packed bed transfer correlations are only reliable for the limited operating conditions for which they were developed 27 therefore previously obtained correlations are not suitable for all industrial processes and cannot be applied to accurately compute heat and mass transfer coefficients for every dcd variation moreover unlike traditional stripping columns in the industry where a gas purges through a liquid and takes one component away in the introduced pb dcd both components water and ipa enter as a gas and the goal is to selectively condense the water and separate the ipa accordingly to characterize and model the mass transfer in the dcd introduced in this research development of an experimental method is required this work presents an empirical model to characterize transport properties of vocs in water and their separation from water it experimentally investigates how a direct contact dehumidifier can separate contaminants from a multi contaminant wastewater experiments are performed to study effects of important parameters including air to vapor and cooling water to vapor mass ratios as well as residence time on the condensation rate and the condensate composition of a multicomponent gaseous mixture in a counter current packed bed direct contact dehumidifier the research characterizes direct contact condensation of multicomponent gaseous mixtures by developing a mass transfer model the parameters of the mass transfer model are obtained from operating conditions of the pb dcd stream conditions and thermodynamic properties the article presents a modified sherwood correlation in the temperature range of 55 to 95 c inside the dehumidifier discharge water temperature a correlation is developed to predict the sherwood number and ipa separation from the gaseous mixture consisting of air water and ipa this can be used to determine the quality of the treated water ipa was selected as a representative compound because its thermochemical properties are close to several contaminants which are often present in oil gas wastewater 2 direct contact dehumidification process figs 1 and 2 show a schematic and a photograph respectively of the humidification dehumidification process of the experimental setup used in this study which simulates the separation section of scepter technology the process 14 consists of a humidification stage where hot air and wastewater vapors mix in a static mixer and a dehumidification stage that consists of a packed bed condenser wherein a gaseous mixture and cooling water are in direct contact in a direct contact dehumidifier heat and mass transfer take place simultaneously primary advantages of a direct contact heat transfer process include simple design minimized fouling corrosion resistance operating with low temperature difference higher efficiency in heat transfer and lower pressure drop 20 28 previous studies have revealed that the cost for unit water production using a direct contact dehumidifier can be reduced up to 60 compared to that of the traditional version 18 in scepter water is selectively condensed from a representative multicomponent fracking wastewater that includes benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol 2be these compounds are common pollutants in produced water and hydraulic fracturing wastewater compounds with lower volatility than water i e species possessing a vapor pressure less than water such as ethylene glycol and 2be are easily separated in a settling tank heating zone module 14 29 this is followed by the dehumidification process where volatile compounds are separated from water due to their relatively higher vapor pressure the hypothesis behind the dehumidification section is that water will be preferentially condensed and air will carry the majority of pollutants out of the system comparing thermodynamic properties at a constant temperature indicates that benzene and toluene have higher saturation vapor pressure compared to water at 30 c their vapor pressures are 15 912 pa and 4892 pa respectively which are larger than that of water 4176 pa therefore benzene and toluene tend to be carried by the airflow in this system in other words through the first module of scepter before the dehumidification section there is a settling tank heating zone where solids dissolved salts and a great portion of less volatile compounds are separated from raw wastewater the temperature in the heating zone is carefully optimized and controlled such that minimum amounts of non volatile chemicals get into the vapor stream exiting the heating zone as a result a vapor mixture that is mainly water as well as benzene and toluene i e volatile compounds enters the mixing zone and mixes with hot air the outlet stream from the mixing zone is a gaseous mixture that enters the dehumidifier where cooling water is distributing from the top dissipating the latent heat of condensation in a direct contact approach blowing hot air and mixing it with the vapor in the mixing zone of the scepter technology helps separate volatile contaminants however by increasing the air to vapor ratio the dew point temperature of the air vapor mixture decreases therefore at the same cooling rate inside the dehumidifier less water condenses in other words there is a trade off between a larger recovery rate and a higher water purity to achieve the desired water recovery and purity the system must be optimized and carefully controlled to perform under optimum temperature and air to vapor mass ratio in the current study ipa has been selected as a representative contaminant to perform the experiments the reason is that it has a vapor pressure close to but slightly smaller than that of toluene and benzene in addition in terms of solubility in water it is completely miscible therefore it is a good representative of the most critical volatile contaminants and it also allows precisely quantifying the amount of contaminant at different stages of the process 3 experimental study 3 1 experimental setup fig 2 shows the laboratory apparatus designed based upon process modeling and built to separate vocs from contaminated water this apparatus allows for controlling the operating conditions of experiments including temperatures and flowrates of air wastewater and cooling water on one side air passes through a heating section and then goes to a spiral static mixer on the other side contaminated water is pumped to the evaporator from which generated vapors enter the static mixer as air and vapors pass through the mixer fixed spiral blades guarantee mixing additional heat is supplied over the mixing zone by means of an ultra high temperature heater used for the pipe temperatures are measured and controlled at the outlet of the air heater and inside the mixing chamber after the mixing zone is the dehumidification section equipped with a packed bed direct contact condenser cooling water is distributed by passing through a perforated plate at the top of the column to find the best performance different perforations sizes and pitches were examined to distribute water with a flowrate in the range of 1 to 12 g s a 3d printer with pla polylactic acid material was used to print various designs these materials are hydrophobic therefore water will not pass through the smaller holes unless a required pressure is provided above the water level or the perforation size is increased to a certain diameter other experiments were also performed to see which property has a greater effect on water distribution in that regard two batches of plates were designed in the first batch plate diameters were altered while pitch remained constant in the second batch there were static diameters with altering pitches it was found that a static diameter with a static pitch performed the best the plate with perforation diameters of 0 075 in and a constant pitch of 0 4 in had the best performance and could distribute water with a flowrate as small as 1 g s the inside of the dehumidification column is filled with structured packing beds the specific surface of structured packing a v is 267 m2 m3 and void fraction equals 0 878 the gaseous feed mixture exiting the mixing zone enters the dehumidification column from the bottom as the gaseous mixture travels upward through the column latent heat of condensation is dissipated by cooling water flowing downward through the column as a result water vapors condense and air carrying contaminants exits from the top contaminants which are mainly toxic volatile organic compounds vocs have relatively high vapor pressure compared to water therefore by carefully controlling the temperature inside the dehumidification section desirable operating condition can be found to ensure maximum water condensation and separation of vocs in air a quantitative gas analyzer is used to identify the concentration of contaminants in the air outlet treated water is collected from the bottom of the column and its quality is tested using gas chromatography gc techniques the process can operate at pressures as low as atmospheric pressure fluid temperatures are below 105 c which can be achieved using low grade waste heat or by integrating with solar thermal energy 30 scalability and modularity of this water purification system make it an attractive alternative for permanent water treatment units the inner diameter of the column is 5 cm and the length of packing beds is 0 5 m two thermocouples type k are installed inside the air outlet to determine dry and wet bulb temperatures of the exiting airflow this allows estimating the amount of water vapor exiting with air stream other thermocouples are located inside the air heater and in the outlet of the mixing zone to measure and control temperatures of air and gaseous mixtures entering the dehumidifier inkbird pid temperature controllers are used and temperature of the generated steam is controlled to be 90 103 c all temperatures are measured with k type thermocouples calibrated with uncertainties of less than 0 5 c the pressure of the system is assumed to be atmospheric pressure two electric cartridge heaters with total rated power of 3 kw are used in the air heater and evaporator flowrates of cooling water and contaminated feed water are measured and controlled by two peristaltic pumps experimental data and measurements were recorded after reaching a steady state a data acquisition system agilent 34972a acquires temperatures and mass flowrates of air flow 3 2 experimental methodology to model the performance of this packed bed direct contact dehumidifier pb dcd heat and mass transfer analysis inside the dehumidifier is required governing equations for the problem are continuity and energy equations as well as mass diffusion relations numerical solutions can be applied to solve these equations and estimate the rate of condensation and composition of condensate however to provide an accurate estimation of heat and mass transfer rates modified nusselt and sherwood correlations that characterize the pb dcd in its operating range are necessary one of the goals of this study is to develop an empirical model that will predict mass transfer coefficient in the pb dcd experiments are performed to investigate the effects of different parameters on separation of contaminant and rate of water condensation from a multicomponent gaseous mixture parameters including cooling water temperature t cw gaseous mixture temperature t g mix air flowrate m a cooling water flowrate m cw contaminated feed water flowrate m fw are considered as variable parameters in the parametric study a dimensional analysis and the buckingham pi theorem 31 are applied to reduce parameters and determine non dimensional numbers experiments have been designed and accomplished to test the performance of the process and to investigate the effects of different parameters on contaminant separation and water condensation operating conditions for these tests are tabulated in table 1 in these experiments hot air feed mixture contaminated water and cooling water flowrates were varied to test different values of air to vapor avr and cooling water to vapor cvr mass ratios as well as reynolds re and schmidt sc numbers the above mentioned ratios are defined below and calculation of re and sc numbers is explained in detail in section 4 2 1 avr m a m v 2 cvr m cw m v 3 3 quantitative analysis validation sample analysis and closing mass balance in this study a hiden quantitative gas analysis qga system was used to analyze gas phase composition and quantify the concentration of each compound in real time both capillary and inlet of the qga are heated thus it is suitable for sampling condensable species such as water and ipa vapors the qga is suitable for sampling from 0 1 to 2 bar absolute to quantify the concentration of different compounds in the liquid phase treated water gas chromatography gc analysis was performed on a trace 1310 gas chromatograph thermo fisher scientific equipped with a flame ionization detector fid in the first phase of experiments a mixture of ipa and water was used as wastewater feed to test setup performance and to validate sampling and quantitative analysis methods by closing the mass balance table 2 shows operating condition for one experiment in this test a feed stream containing 0 5 wt ipa 1 75 mg s ipa was fed to the dcc to satisfy the mass balance it is required that total ipa mass leaving the dcc from the top gas phase and from the bottom liquid phase be equal to the initial ipa mass however there are some uncertainties and error due to measurement techniques human error loss of ipa during sampling etc therefore it is important to confirm the mass balance is satisfied or has minimum error fig 3 shows the mass balance of ipa for one representative experiment the upper region represents the gas phase showing percent of ipa that is separated with air and the lower region represents the liquid phase demonstrating percent of ipa remaining in the condensed water the summation should be 100 to satisfy the mass balance similar tests were repeated for more experiments and the repeatability error was found to be 1 0 and 3 8 for gc and qga analyses respectively the repeatability error in mass balance analysis was found to be 6 3 4 feed mixture isopropyl alcohol ipa was used to prepare contaminated feed water for the experiments as shown in table 1 0 5 wt of ipa in water was used as contaminated feed water to the evaporator it mixes with hot air in the mixer resulting in a multicomponent gaseous mixture containing air ipa and water vapor which enters the pb dcd ipa separation and water recovery are two main performance indicators in this process and are defined below 3 ipa separation x ipa a m a x ipa fw m fw 4 w ater recovery m cd m fw mass of condensed water was obtained from the rate of water vapor exiting with air from the top of the dcd in this regard using measured wet and dry bulb temperatures of exiting air and assuming atmospheric pressure and diluted gaseous mixture the humidity of exiting air was obtained from the coolprop 32 33 database of humid air properties using the humidity ratio and knowing input dry air and input vapor mass flowrate condensate flowrate can be calculated as explained in section 3 3 gc is applied to determine the concentration of ipa in the treated water 3 5 instrument and uncertainty analysis in this study temperatures and flowrates were either measured or controlled depending on the condition two thermocouples type k with accuracy of 0 75 were used to measure cooling water and gaseous mixture temperatures the temperature of the gaseous feed mixture was controlled using an inkbird pid temperature controller other temperatures including discharge water i e treated water temperature wet and dry bulb temperatures of exiting air and hot air temperature were measured using thermocouples type k with accuracy of 0 7 c a brooks air mass flow controller model 5850e with an accuracy of 1 full scale i e 0 003 g s and repeatability equal to 0 25 of rate was used to control the inlet air flowrate two adjustable peristaltic pump with accuracy of 0 01 g s were used to control flowrates of wastewater feed entering the evaporator and cooling water entering the top of the dcc column respectively for most of data points the error bars are not visible due to the size of the marker therefore uncertainties for measured experimental parameters are reported next to actual values in each table to estimate uncertainties in dependent variables given uncertainties in independent variables kline s and mcclintock s technique 34 was applied in general for any dependent variable such as f 5 f f x 1 x 2 x 3 x n uncertainty is obtained from 6 σ f f x i σ i 2 this technique is used to estimate uncertainties of dependent variables in this study such as avr cvr re etc which are reported in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 parametric study different experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the pb dcd the goal of these experiments was to investigate effects of different parameters on water recovery and water quality therefore parametric study was done to characterize the system and develop an empirical model for mass transfer inside the pb dcd contaminated water containing ipa with different concentrations was used as the wastewater feed to the system in total more than 159 samples were collected to test different operating condition and to validate some of the test results table 4 shows the test matrix for parametric study 4 2 mass transfer analysis empirical correlation sherwood number sh represents the ratio of convective mass transfer rate to the rate of diffusion mass transport in the current study sh is used to estimate the mass transfer coefficient and the mass transfer rate in the pb dcd experimental data is used to calculate the sherwood number which is defined as below 7 sh f d c d in eq 7 f is the mass transfer coefficient and can be calculated from the experimental data for mass transfer flux and concentration difference as follow 35 8 f k x x j m in eq 8 k x is mass transfer coefficient in liquid phase with unit of mole m2 s and can be calculated from experimental values of mass transfer flux n i as shown in eq 10 x j m is concentration of component j and can be calculated using eq 9 9 x j m x j 2 x j 1 ln x j 2 x j 1 10 n i k x x i on the other hand to estimate the mass transfer coefficient f a correlation is required that computes sh from other non dimensional numbers that can be calculated more easily from operating conditions i e temperatures and flowrates in a previous study 36 we performed a comparison between several mass transfer coefficient correlations for air vapor and liquid in packed bed direct contact condenser it was observed that the error increases as the air temperature at the inlet increases moreover it was found that some of the models only work for half of the experimental data e g for liquid phase only however there are significant errors in prediction when using the correlation for gas phase some of the potential causes of error are lack of representative parameters to reflect the flow dynamic characteristics and misrepresentation of packed bed geometry table 5 shows some of the mass transfer correlations from literature and their applications as explained previously published packed bed transfer correlations are only reliable for limited operating conditions for which they were developed 27 therefore previously published correlations are not suitable for all industrial processes and cannot be applied to accurately compute heat and mass transfer coefficients in the dcd introduced in this research which has a customized packed bed accordingly to characterize and model the performance of the current pb dcd a general model for the modified sherwood correlation is expressed as a function of reynolds and schmidt numbers as well as two more non dimensional numbers i e avr and cvr as below first in order to develop a model for the mass transfer as a function of physical and thermodynamic properties as well as operating conditions the form of the model must be determined the mass transfer coefficient f was taken to be a function of the air mass flow rate m a feed wastewater mass flow rate m fw cooling water mass flow rate m cw gaseous mixture temperature t g mix cooling water temperature t cw density ρ viscosity μ molecular diffusion coefficient d ij particle diameter d p diameter of packed bed d void fraction ε specific surface of packed bed a v and molar density of a mixture c consequently the functional form for the mass transfer coefficient becomes 11 f f m a m fw m cw t g mix t cw ρ μ d ij d p d ε a v c the buckingham pi theorem was used to determine the dimensionless groups that define this system as 12 sh a re g b re l c sc d av r e cvr f to determine the constants a b c d e and f in eq 12 different optimization methods such as genetic algorithm 42 43 and nelder mead algorithm were performed to fit experimental data and provide an empirical correlation all non dimensional numbers in the sherwood correlation are calculated based on experimental data as well as thermodynamic and physical properties reynolds number is defined as 13 re ρvd μ reynolds number in a packed bed is calculated using the approach in 44 which is briefly explained below for a packed bed of non spherical particles the effective particle diameter is defined as 14 d p 6 a v where a v is the specific surface of packing material a v in m 1 and is defined as 15 a v surface area of packed bed volume of packed bed the specific surface a v of the packed bed in the current study is 267 m2 m3 the void fraction ε for a packed bed is defined as 16 ε volume of voids in bed total volume of bed voids plus solids experiments were performed to measure the void fraction of the structured packing used in the dcd accordingly the void fraction is 0 87 the equivalent diameter d for a channel is d 4r h while 17 r h ε 6 1 ε d p therefore reynolds number in a packed bed is as follows 18 re 4 ε 1 ε ρv μ a v where v is the average interstitial velocity in the bed for the gaseous flow it equals 19 v g a c schmidt number is the ratio of viscous diffusion rate and mass diffusion rate and is defined as 20 sc μ ρd in eq 20 d is mass diffusivity in a ternary ideal gas mixture where component 1 is being absorbed from a mixture of components 1 2 and 3 by a non volatile liquid in a wetted wall column operating at 1 atm the effective diffusion rate of component 1 can be estimated as described in 45 as follows 21 d 1 f 1 y 1 y 2 d 12 y 3 d 13 22 d 1 eff d 1 f z 0 d 1 f z δ 2 in the above equations y i is the concentration of component i z 0 represents boundary condition in bulk gas and z δ represents boundary condition in the interface the above equations are used in model development the developed correlation is then used to calculate sherwood number model predictions are compared with experimental values in fig 8 4 3 experiment results and discussion in the first batch of experiments different avrs for various cvrs were tested to study the effect of these parameters on ipa separation and water recovery while maintaining cooling water at 21 c fig 4 shows experiment results and illustrates that for all cvrs increasing the avr has a direct effect on ipa separation but a reverse effect on water recovery this is because the presence of a non condensable gas air in the mixture decreases the rate of heat transfer heat dissipation it also reduces the dew point temperature of the humid gaseous mixture therefore at the fixed cooling water temperature with a fixed cooling rate less amounts of condensable compounds such as ipa condenses conversely increasing the cvr leads to lower ipa separation increasing cvr is equivalent to increasing the rate of heat dissipation accordingly ipa condensation is more probable and less ipa is separated with air more experiments were performed to investigate the effects of avr on mass transfer inside the pb dcd operating at different re l as well as various temperatures of gaseous mixture entering the condenser mass transfer is defined in terms of sherwood number sh and some of the above experiments results are plotted in fig 5 sh is a dimensionless number which represents the ratio of convective mass transfer rate to the rate of diffusion mass transport in the current study the higher sh represents higher rate of ipa condensation or in other words lower ipa separation as explained above more presence of non condensable gas can assist separation of ipa from the mixture and results in sh in the second batch of experiments the effect of varying cvr on sh was investigated experiment results for two different re l are shown in fig 6 accordingly increasing the cvr increases sh this supports the hypothesis that improving the rate of heat dissipation in this case by increasing cvr more ipa condenses which results in larger values of sh finally in the third batch of experiments the effect of reynolds number re g on ipa mass transfer was investigated sherwood number sh which is defined for the liquid phase and represents the coefficient of convective mass transfer rate of ipa to its diffusion rate into water is computed as explained in section 4 2 as illustrated in fig 7 a at fixed cvrs and avrs increasing re g leads to a reduction in ipa separation and therefore an increase in sh comparing two different avrs of 1 0 and 0 5 at cvr 8 in fig 7 b demonstrates that ipa mass transfer at lower avr is more sensitive to the re g compared to that at higher avrs experimental results shown in fig 5 also support the fact that increasing cvrs results in lower ipa separation in the pb dcd fig 7 illustrates that increasing re g leads to an increase in mass transfer coefficient f and sh which corresponds to smaller ipa separation varying flowrates of air cooling water and contaminated water in these experiments also allows study of the effects of varying the schmidt number on ipa mass transfer in summary performing these parametric studies allowed for the investigation of relationships between the pi groups sherwood number reynolds number schmidt number avr and cvr as explained before the modified sherwood correlation is expressed as a function of schmidt number liquid and gas phase reynolds number as well as avr and cvr as shown in eq 12 to determine constants and exponents in eq 12 different optimization methods such as genetic algorithm have been examined to fit experimental data finally the optimization problem using experimental data was solved by applying the nelder mead simplex algorithm 46 47 to minimize the mean absolute percentage error mape which is defined as follows 23 mape 1 n t 1 n sh exp sh model sh exp the optimization objective function was solved for unknown coefficients in the modified sherwood correlation model finding constant coefficients from optimization the empirical correlation for the modified sherwood number is provided with mean absolute error equal to 6 6 the empirical correlation to model the ipa mass transfer from a ternary gaseous mixture to water is expressed in the following form 24 sh 2 63 10 3 re g 0 35 re l 0 83 sc 0 10 av r 0 39 cvr 0 60 this correlation is valid for re g in the range of 400 2500 and re l range from 25 to 130 the model only depends on the inlet information such as operating temperatures and flowrates to obtain the sherwood number using eq 7 mass transfer coefficient of ipa f can be calculated from a predicted sherwood number considering the exponents of non dimensional parameters in eq 24 it is understood that reynolds and schmidt numbers as well as cvr have direct effect on larger mass transfer coefficient of ipa from the gaseous mixture to the liquid phase on the contrary avr has an inverse effect on the mass transfer coefficient among the reinforcing parameters re l has the biggest effect on the sh or in other words the mass transfer coefficient f figs 5 and 6 support this fact similarly in fig 7 b indicates that for a fixed re g and cvr increasing the avr can significantly reduce the mass transfer coefficient and sh number it was found that increasing the schmidt number has a direct effect on the mass transfer coefficient of ipa as mentioned before schmidt number is a function of three thermodynamic properties viscosity density and diffusivity in the current study coolprop was used to define the viscosity and density of mixtures as a function of temperature pressure and composition therefore schmidt number implicitly depends on temperature of gaseous mixture as well as partial pressure of ipa in theory it is expected that at higher partial pressure of ipa more of it condenses and goes into the water phase considering eqs 21 and 22 higher partial pressure of ipa corresponds to larger values of ipa concentration y 1 which means smaller values of diffusivity coefficient and as a result larger values of schmidt number according to the presented modified sherwood correlation increasing sc leads to an increase of sherwood and as a result larger mass transfer coefficient of ipa hence a positive value for the exponent of sc in the presented sh correlation completely supports the aforementioned hypothesis similarly a higher avr corresponds to a lower partial pressure of ipa which means larger diffusivity coefficient consequently smaller schmidt number corresponds to a larger sherwood number and this supports the hypothesis as well residence time is another significant parameter that was studied residence time can be calculated by dividing bed height by interstitial velocity in the bed as explained in section 4 2 for a fixed packing size and bed height residence time is proportional to the inverse of velocity and reynolds number therefore at a higher velocity which corresponds to a larger re residence time is smaller as a result lower separation rate is achieved in other words at a higher velocity i e lower residence time less voc can be separated in gas phase which results in a larger mass transfer and diffusion rate to the liquid phase i e larger sh this hypothesis is supported by experiment results shown in fig 7 the proposed correlation is used to estimate sh number based on the operating condition of the system and inlet streams fig 8 shows the predicted sherwood versus the experimental values of sherwood the mean absolute percentage error is 6 6 in addition more than 86 of the predicted sherwood values are within a 10 relative error 5 conclusion the goal of this study is to experimentally investigate how a direct contact dehumidifier can separate contaminant from a gaseous mixture and develop an empirical model to predict the mass transfer coefficient of ipa into the water phase and estimate the water quality a packed bed direct contact dehumidifier was designed and fabricated experiments were performed to separate contaminant from gaseous mixture using the packed bed dehumidifier designed and constructed for this research a direct contact approach in the condenser of dehumidifier was chosen to maximize the heat recovery from fluid streams experimental results show that the process can successfully remove a significant fraction of contaminants from water according to the experimental results a maximum ipa separation of 76 3 was achieved by operating at avr 1 45 and cvr 5 4 this corresponds to sh 4 69 and re g 1611 the obtained water recovery at this condition was 58 7 parametric analysis was conducted to study the effect of air to vapor and cooling water to vapor mass ratios as well as residence time on the condensation rate and the condensate composition of a multicomponent gaseous mixture in a counter current packed bed direct contact dehumidifier this allowed for development of a mass transfer correlation to describe the process a modified sherwood correlation was presented that uses the operating condition of the system as well as thermodynamic properties and composition of inlet streams to predict the mass transfer coefficient of ipa the modified sherwood correlation was successfully used to predict the sherwood number with a mean absolute error of 6 6 it was found that the obtained constants and exponents for the sherwood correlation support the hypothesis that higher partial pressure of ipa and lower temperature of gaseous mixture or lower rate of heat dissipation due to smaller heat transfer driving force are two key parameters that lead to a larger mass transfer coefficient of ipa and as a result larger sherwood number the two new non dimensional parameters i e avr and cvr presented were found to improve the modified sherwood correlation future work will involve expanding the applicability range of the correlation and validating it for a wider range of reynolds and schmidt numbers as well as other non dimensional parameters furthermore experiments and parametric study will be conducted to test water contaminated with various contaminants including vocs and heavy organics that may be found in oil and gas wastewater there are more challenges for developing a broader model that can be applicable for a multicomponent mixture some of the difficulties are multi component and multiphase problem non equilibrium thermodynamics due to a dynamic process and complex configuration the above characteristics create a very complex problem the ultimate goal is to develop a method to model the mass transfer rate in a multicomponent mixture such as highly contaminated wastewater and optimize the introduced pb dcd for treatment of

12559,a packed bed direct contact dehumidifier pb dcd has been developed to selectively condense water from a gaseous mixture of organic contaminants in this process hot air is humidified by mixing with wastewater vapor in a static mixer and is dehumidified by subcooled fresh water passing through the pb dcd in a counter current configuration the goal of this study is to understand the relationship between various operating parameters and how they affect separation of isopropyl alcohol ipa from the gaseous mixture with the purpose of expanding the investigation to other contaminants in the future the process has been successfully used to separate ipa from wastewater different parameters including the concentration of ipa in water feed temperature air to vapor ratio and cooling

voc volatile organic compound us united states 1 introduction in the past few decades rapid development in the oil and gas industry has contributed significantly to energy security but also led to the production of large amounts of contaminated water produced water is the largest volume by product of the oil and gas extraction industry the volume of produced water generated in the united states us is estimated to be more than 2 4 billion m3 each year 1 hydraulic fracturing or fracking is one of the methods for extracting oil and natural gas from deep in the earth whose extraction process typically requires from 7000 to 21 000 m3 of fresh water per well the largest by product of hydraulic fracturing is wastewater 2 according to a federal reserve report unconventional wells can produce flowback volumes ranging between 1000 and 10 000 m3 during the initial flowback process 3 unfortunately fracking wastewater contains numerous contaminants including toxic compounds therefore discharging it into the environment may contaminate surface waters including potential sources of drinking and irrigation water 4 air quality can also be affected due to evaporation of volatile chemicals from wastewater one commonly used solution to these problems is underground injection in the us there are approximately 180 000 class ii wells these wells are used to inject brines and fluids associated with oil and gas production in operation about 20 of oil and gas related injection wells are from brines and hydraulic fracturing wastewater separated hydrocarbons from such brines are also disposed of in these such wells in the us an estimated of 9 million m3 of fluid are estimated to be injected into these types of wells per day 5 the volume of produced water disposed by underground injection is decreasing however according to data from 2007 98 of the total produced water from shale gas industry was managed by underground injection 6 in texas there were about 35 000 class ii injection wells and 1152 specifically permitted for oil and gas waste as of 2014 7 in a 2012 study of waste from the marcellus shale it was concluded that 26 6 of produced brine was disposed of through deep well injection of this 280 000 m3 of produced water 5600 m3 of drilling fluids and 16 700 m3 of flowback were disposed of by deep well injection 8 in west virginia at least 180 000 m3 of wastewater were injected between 2002 and 2014 from various unconventional oil and gas wells 9 underground injection is a technique that requires properly constructed wells poor construction can cause diffusion of contaminants into freshwater reservoirs accordingly it is important to treat such contaminated water or at least separate toxic chemicals from wastewater before discharging it into the environment thermal separation techniques are suitable methods for treating produced water because they can be integrated with low grade energy and waste heat available at oil extraction sites 10 11 humidification dehumidification is one of these techniques that has proven to be an effective method for water desalination 12 it also has been used for the desalination of produced water 13 in this study humidification dehumidification is used in a water purification process 14 for treatment of a multicomponent wastewater a packed bed direct contact dehumidifier pb dcd has been designed for this purpose and fabricated to separate organic contaminants from wastewater the pb dcd is a key component of a novel treatment technology scepter 14 which is a freshwater recovery system for hydraulic fracturing in the humidification section of the process wastewater is vaporized in an evaporator it then mixes with hot air in a static mixing chamber next the vapor mixture enters the dehumidification section which is equipped with a direct contact condenser dcc to maximize heat recovery from fluid streams the direct contact dehumidifier is a vertical column filled with structured packing materials wherein cooling water is distributed from the top and the gaseous mixture enters from the bottom there are previous studies 15 18 on modeling a humidification dehumidification system equipped with a direct contact dehumidifier these studies have accomplished parametric analysis or modeling of the system based on heat and mass transfer li et al 19 developed a two fluid model using one dimensional mass and energy conservation equations for a packed bed direct contact condenser their analytical model was successful in predicting the thermal performance of the hdh including temperature variation humidity and condensation rate through each stage of the condenser however since their model is developed for condensation of water vapor out of an air vapor mixture it is not applicable for a multicomponent mixture he et al 18 proposed an hdh desalination system using waste heat through plate heat exchangers they developed a mathematical model based on equations of mass and energy to evaluate the performance of the hdh by calculating parameters such as clean water production versus different operating condition their study indicates that using a direct contact dehumidifier has great advantages compared with the traditional hdh saeed et al 16 performed experiments to test the performance of an hdh system with dcd under various operating conditions to explore the influence of temperatures and mass flowrates of seawater and freshwater on performance efficiency also they used non dimensional parameters to investigate optimum working conditions that maximize the freshwater production rate they showed that by reducing the seawater to freshwater mass flowrate ratio and increasing the temperature of seawater entering the humidifier recovery rate of direct contact dehumidifier increases according to their study liquid to gas flowrate ratio highly affects the effectiveness of the dehumidifier however since their model does not include mass transfer of components it is not applicable for characterizing the system utilized in this research in general the above studies focus on steam only air steam flows or desalination none of them investigate a multicomponent gaseous mixture condensation in a humidification dehumidification system 20 for a mixture vapor liquid equilibrium vle is a quantitative description of how each component is distributed in each phase at a specific temperature and pressure for binary mixtures vle is represented by bubble point and dew point curves there are many studies that deal with prediction methods for condensation of ternary vapor mixtures 21 however published vle data or models for multicomponent fluid mixtures are very limited 22 megan et al 22 developed a technique based on the advanced distillation curve adc to measure the phase equilibrium of multicomponent fluid mixtures however their model is not suitable for a gaseous mixture as they did not consider the effect of non condensable gas krishna and panchal 23 used a film model for multicomponent mass transfer based on an exact solution to the maxwell stefan equation to analyze the condensation of a binary vapor mixture in the presence of a non condensable gas their mathematical analysis only considered condensation in a vertical tube it did not investigate effects of a packed bed on fluid streams in another study jeremie et al 24 studied the condensation of a binary mixture in the presence of a non condensable gas however their study was only from a heat transfer point of view kotake 25 studied the effects of a small amount of non condensable gas on film condensation of a binary vapor mixture he used a perturbation method to solve mass transfer and phase equilibrium equations at the liquid vapor interface an experimental study of condensation of a hydrocarbon in the presence of a non condensable gas was conducted by gu et al 26 to investigate the heat and mass transfer mechanism there are many other studies for condensation of vapor mixtures with or without non condensable gas however these models and their mass and heat transfer analogies are usually developed based on film condensation in the case of packed columns with a counter current direct contact configuration correlations are required to determine heat and mass transfer coefficients in particular researchers have suggested that published packed bed transfer correlations are only reliable for the limited operating conditions for which they were developed 27 therefore previously obtained correlations are not suitable for all industrial processes and cannot be applied to accurately compute heat and mass transfer coefficients for every dcd variation moreover unlike traditional stripping columns in the industry where a gas purges through a liquid and takes one component away in the introduced pb dcd both components water and ipa enter as a gas and the goal is to selectively condense the water and separate the ipa accordingly to characterize and model the mass transfer in the dcd introduced in this research development of an experimental method is required this work presents an empirical model to characterize transport properties of vocs in water and their separation from water it experimentally investigates how a direct contact dehumidifier can separate contaminants from a multi contaminant wastewater experiments are performed to study effects of important parameters including air to vapor and cooling water to vapor mass ratios as well as residence time on the condensation rate and the condensate composition of a multicomponent gaseous mixture in a counter current packed bed direct contact dehumidifier the research characterizes direct contact condensation of multicomponent gaseous mixtures by developing a mass transfer model the parameters of the mass transfer model are obtained from operating conditions of the pb dcd stream conditions and thermodynamic properties the article presents a modified sherwood correlation in the temperature range of 55 to 95 c inside the dehumidifier discharge water temperature a correlation is developed to predict the sherwood number and ipa separation from the gaseous mixture consisting of air water and ipa this can be used to determine the quality of the treated water ipa was selected as a representative compound because its thermochemical properties are close to several contaminants which are often present in oil gas wastewater 2 direct contact dehumidification process figs 1 and 2 show a schematic and a photograph respectively of the humidification dehumidification process of the experimental setup used in this study which simulates the separation section of scepter technology the process 14 consists of a humidification stage where hot air and wastewater vapors mix in a static mixer and a dehumidification stage that consists of a packed bed condenser wherein a gaseous mixture and cooling water are in direct contact in a direct contact dehumidifier heat and mass transfer take place simultaneously primary advantages of a direct contact heat transfer process include simple design minimized fouling corrosion resistance operating with low temperature difference higher efficiency in heat transfer and lower pressure drop 20 28 previous studies have revealed that the cost for unit water production using a direct contact dehumidifier can be reduced up to 60 compared to that of the traditional version 18 in scepter water is selectively condensed from a representative multicomponent fracking wastewater that includes benzene toluene 2 propanol ethylene glycol and 2 butoxyethanol 2be these compounds are common pollutants in produced water and hydraulic fracturing wastewater compounds with lower volatility than water i e species possessing a vapor pressure less than water such as ethylene glycol and 2be are easily separated in a settling tank heating zone module 14 29 this is followed by the dehumidification process where volatile compounds are separated from water due to their relatively higher vapor pressure the hypothesis behind the dehumidification section is that water will be preferentially condensed and air will carry the majority of pollutants out of the system comparing thermodynamic properties at a constant temperature indicates that benzene and toluene have higher saturation vapor pressure compared to water at 30 c their vapor pressures are 15 912 pa and 4892 pa respectively which are larger than that of water 4176 pa therefore benzene and toluene tend to be carried by the airflow in this system in other words through the first module of scepter before the dehumidification section there is a settling tank heating zone where solids dissolved salts and a great portion of less volatile compounds are separated from raw wastewater the temperature in the heating zone is carefully optimized and controlled such that minimum amounts of non volatile chemicals get into the vapor stream exiting the heating zone as a result a vapor mixture that is mainly water as well as benzene and toluene i e volatile compounds enters the mixing zone and mixes with hot air the outlet stream from the mixing zone is a gaseous mixture that enters the dehumidifier where cooling water is distributing from the top dissipating the latent heat of condensation in a direct contact approach blowing hot air and mixing it with the vapor in the mixing zone of the scepter technology helps separate volatile contaminants however by increasing the air to vapor ratio the dew point temperature of the air vapor mixture decreases therefore at the same cooling rate inside the dehumidifier less water condenses in other words there is a trade off between a larger recovery rate and a higher water purity to achieve the desired water recovery and purity the system must be optimized and carefully controlled to perform under optimum temperature and air to vapor mass ratio in the current study ipa has been selected as a representative contaminant to perform the experiments the reason is that it has a vapor pressure close to but slightly smaller than that of toluene and benzene in addition in terms of solubility in water it is completely miscible therefore it is a good representative of the most critical volatile contaminants and it also allows precisely quantifying the amount of contaminant at different stages of the process 3 experimental study 3 1 experimental setup fig 2 shows the laboratory apparatus designed based upon process modeling and built to separate vocs from contaminated water this apparatus allows for controlling the operating conditions of experiments including temperatures and flowrates of air wastewater and cooling water on one side air passes through a heating section and then goes to a spiral static mixer on the other side contaminated water is pumped to the evaporator from which generated vapors enter the static mixer as air and vapors pass through the mixer fixed spiral blades guarantee mixing additional heat is supplied over the mixing zone by means of an ultra high temperature heater used for the pipe temperatures are measured and controlled at the outlet of the air heater and inside the mixing chamber after the mixing zone is the dehumidification section equipped with a packed bed direct contact condenser cooling water is distributed by passing through a perforated plate at the top of the column to find the best performance different perforations sizes and pitches were examined to distribute water with a flowrate in the range of 1 to 12 g s a 3d printer with pla polylactic acid material was used to print various designs these materials are hydrophobic therefore water will not pass through the smaller holes unless a required pressure is provided above the water level or the perforation size is increased to a certain diameter other experiments were also performed to see which property has a greater effect on water distribution in that regard two batches of plates were designed in the first batch plate diameters were altered while pitch remained constant in the second batch there were static diameters with altering pitches it was found that a static diameter with a static pitch performed the best the plate with perforation diameters of 0 075 in and a constant pitch of 0 4 in had the best performance and could distribute water with a flowrate as small as 1 g s the inside of the dehumidification column is filled with structured packing beds the specific surface of structured packing a v is 267 m2 m3 and void fraction equals 0 878 the gaseous feed mixture exiting the mixing zone enters the dehumidification column from the bottom as the gaseous mixture travels upward through the column latent heat of condensation is dissipated by cooling water flowing downward through the column as a result water vapors condense and air carrying contaminants exits from the top contaminants which are mainly toxic volatile organic compounds vocs have relatively high vapor pressure compared to water therefore by carefully controlling the temperature inside the dehumidification section desirable operating condition can be found to ensure maximum water condensation and separation of vocs in air a quantitative gas analyzer is used to identify the concentration of contaminants in the air outlet treated water is collected from the bottom of the column and its quality is tested using gas chromatography gc techniques the process can operate at pressures as low as atmospheric pressure fluid temperatures are below 105 c which can be achieved using low grade waste heat or by integrating with solar thermal energy 30 scalability and modularity of this water purification system make it an attractive alternative for permanent water treatment units the inner diameter of the column is 5 cm and the length of packing beds is 0 5 m two thermocouples type k are installed inside the air outlet to determine dry and wet bulb temperatures of the exiting airflow this allows estimating the amount of water vapor exiting with air stream other thermocouples are located inside the air heater and in the outlet of the mixing zone to measure and control temperatures of air and gaseous mixtures entering the dehumidifier inkbird pid temperature controllers are used and temperature of the generated steam is controlled to be 90 103 c all temperatures are measured with k type thermocouples calibrated with uncertainties of less than 0 5 c the pressure of the system is assumed to be atmospheric pressure two electric cartridge heaters with total rated power of 3 kw are used in the air heater and evaporator flowrates of cooling water and contaminated feed water are measured and controlled by two peristaltic pumps experimental data and measurements were recorded after reaching a steady state a data acquisition system agilent 34972a acquires temperatures and mass flowrates of air flow 3 2 experimental methodology to model the performance of this packed bed direct contact dehumidifier pb dcd heat and mass transfer analysis inside the dehumidifier is required governing equations for the problem are continuity and energy equations as well as mass diffusion relations numerical solutions can be applied to solve these equations and estimate the rate of condensation and composition of condensate however to provide an accurate estimation of heat and mass transfer rates modified nusselt and sherwood correlations that characterize the pb dcd in its operating range are necessary one of the goals of this study is to develop an empirical model that will predict mass transfer coefficient in the pb dcd experiments are performed to investigate the effects of different parameters on separation of contaminant and rate of water condensation from a multicomponent gaseous mixture parameters including cooling water temperature t cw gaseous mixture temperature t g mix air flowrate m a cooling water flowrate m cw contaminated feed water flowrate m fw are considered as variable parameters in the parametric study a dimensional analysis and the buckingham pi theorem 31 are applied to reduce parameters and determine non dimensional numbers experiments have been designed and accomplished to test the performance of the process and to investigate the effects of different parameters on contaminant separation and water condensation operating conditions for these tests are tabulated in table 1 in these experiments hot air feed mixture contaminated water and cooling water flowrates were varied to test different values of air to vapor avr and cooling water to vapor cvr mass ratios as well as reynolds re and schmidt sc numbers the above mentioned ratios are defined below and calculation of re and sc numbers is explained in detail in section 4 2 1 avr m a m v 2 cvr m cw m v 3 3 quantitative analysis validation sample analysis and closing mass balance in this study a hiden quantitative gas analysis qga system was used to analyze gas phase composition and quantify the concentration of each compound in real time both capillary and inlet of the qga are heated thus it is suitable for sampling condensable species such as water and ipa vapors the qga is suitable for sampling from 0 1 to 2 bar absolute to quantify the concentration of different compounds in the liquid phase treated water gas chromatography gc analysis was performed on a trace 1310 gas chromatograph thermo fisher scientific equipped with a flame ionization detector fid in the first phase of experiments a mixture of ipa and water was used as wastewater feed to test setup performance and to validate sampling and quantitative analysis methods by closing the mass balance table 2 shows operating condition for one experiment in this test a feed stream containing 0 5 wt ipa 1 75 mg s ipa was fed to the dcc to satisfy the mass balance it is required that total ipa mass leaving the dcc from the top gas phase and from the bottom liquid phase be equal to the initial ipa mass however there are some uncertainties and error due to measurement techniques human error loss of ipa during sampling etc therefore it is important to confirm the mass balance is satisfied or has minimum error fig 3 shows the mass balance of ipa for one representative experiment the upper region represents the gas phase showing percent of ipa that is separated with air and the lower region represents the liquid phase demonstrating percent of ipa remaining in the condensed water the summation should be 100 to satisfy the mass balance similar tests were repeated for more experiments and the repeatability error was found to be 1 0 and 3 8 for gc and qga analyses respectively the repeatability error in mass balance analysis was found to be 6 3 4 feed mixture isopropyl alcohol ipa was used to prepare contaminated feed water for the experiments as shown in table 1 0 5 wt of ipa in water was used as contaminated feed water to the evaporator it mixes with hot air in the mixer resulting in a multicomponent gaseous mixture containing air ipa and water vapor which enters the pb dcd ipa separation and water recovery are two main performance indicators in this process and are defined below 3 ipa separation x ipa a m a x ipa fw m fw 4 w ater recovery m cd m fw mass of condensed water was obtained from the rate of water vapor exiting with air from the top of the dcd in this regard using measured wet and dry bulb temperatures of exiting air and assuming atmospheric pressure and diluted gaseous mixture the humidity of exiting air was obtained from the coolprop 32 33 database of humid air properties using the humidity ratio and knowing input dry air and input vapor mass flowrate condensate flowrate can be calculated as explained in section 3 3 gc is applied to determine the concentration of ipa in the treated water 3 5 instrument and uncertainty analysis in this study temperatures and flowrates were either measured or controlled depending on the condition two thermocouples type k with accuracy of 0 75 were used to measure cooling water and gaseous mixture temperatures the temperature of the gaseous feed mixture was controlled using an inkbird pid temperature controller other temperatures including discharge water i e treated water temperature wet and dry bulb temperatures of exiting air and hot air temperature were measured using thermocouples type k with accuracy of 0 7 c a brooks air mass flow controller model 5850e with an accuracy of 1 full scale i e 0 003 g s and repeatability equal to 0 25 of rate was used to control the inlet air flowrate two adjustable peristaltic pump with accuracy of 0 01 g s were used to control flowrates of wastewater feed entering the evaporator and cooling water entering the top of the dcc column respectively for most of data points the error bars are not visible due to the size of the marker therefore uncertainties for measured experimental parameters are reported next to actual values in each table to estimate uncertainties in dependent variables given uncertainties in independent variables kline s and mcclintock s technique 34 was applied in general for any dependent variable such as f 5 f f x 1 x 2 x 3 x n uncertainty is obtained from 6 σ f f x i σ i 2 this technique is used to estimate uncertainties of dependent variables in this study such as avr cvr re etc which are reported in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 parametric study different experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the pb dcd the goal of these experiments was to investigate effects of different parameters on water recovery and water quality therefore parametric study was done to characterize the system and develop an empirical model for mass transfer inside the pb dcd contaminated water containing ipa with different concentrations was used as the wastewater feed to the system in total more than 159 samples were collected to test different operating condition and to validate some of the test results table 4 shows the test matrix for parametric study 4 2 mass transfer analysis empirical correlation sherwood number sh represents the ratio of convective mass transfer rate to the rate of diffusion mass transport in the current study sh is used to estimate the mass transfer coefficient and the mass transfer rate in the pb dcd experimental data is used to calculate the sherwood number which is defined as below 7 sh f d c d in eq 7 f is the mass transfer coefficient and can be calculated from the experimental data for mass transfer flux and concentration difference as follow 35 8 f k x x j m in eq 8 k x is mass transfer coefficient in liquid phase with unit of mole m2 s and can be calculated from experimental values of mass transfer flux n i as shown in eq 10 x j m is concentration of component j and can be calculated using eq 9 9 x j m x j 2 x j 1 ln x j 2 x j 1 10 n i k x x i on the other hand to estimate the mass transfer coefficient f a correlation is required that computes sh from other non dimensional numbers that can be calculated more easily from operating conditions i e temperatures and flowrates in a previous study 36 we performed a comparison between several mass transfer coefficient correlations for air vapor and liquid in packed bed direct contact condenser it was observed that the error increases as the air temperature at the inlet increases moreover it was found that some of the models only work for half of the experimental data e g for liquid phase only however there are significant errors in prediction when using the correlation for gas phase some of the potential causes of error are lack of representative parameters to reflect the flow dynamic characteristics and misrepresentation of packed bed geometry table 5 shows some of the mass transfer correlations from literature and their applications as explained previously published packed bed transfer correlations are only reliable for limited operating conditions for which they were developed 27 therefore previously published correlations are not suitable for all industrial processes and cannot be applied to accurately compute heat and mass transfer coefficients in the dcd introduced in this research which has a customized packed bed accordingly to characterize and model the performance of the current pb dcd a general model for the modified sherwood correlation is expressed as a function of reynolds and schmidt numbers as well as two more non dimensional numbers i e avr and cvr as below first in order to develop a model for the mass transfer as a function of physical and thermodynamic properties as well as operating conditions the form of the model must be determined the mass transfer coefficient f was taken to be a function of the air mass flow rate m a feed wastewater mass flow rate m fw cooling water mass flow rate m cw gaseous mixture temperature t g mix cooling water temperature t cw density ρ viscosity μ molecular diffusion coefficient d ij particle diameter d p diameter of packed bed d void fraction ε specific surface of packed bed a v and molar density of a mixture c consequently the functional form for the mass transfer coefficient becomes 11 f f m a m fw m cw t g mix t cw ρ μ d ij d p d ε a v c the buckingham pi theorem was used to determine the dimensionless groups that define this system as 12 sh a re g b re l c sc d av r e cvr f to determine the constants a b c d e and f in eq 12 different optimization methods such as genetic algorithm 42 43 and nelder mead algorithm were performed to fit experimental data and provide an empirical correlation all non dimensional numbers in the sherwood correlation are calculated based on experimental data as well as thermodynamic and physical properties reynolds number is defined as 13 re ρvd μ reynolds number in a packed bed is calculated using the approach in 44 which is briefly explained below for a packed bed of non spherical particles the effective particle diameter is defined as 14 d p 6 a v where a v is the specific surface of packing material a v in m 1 and is defined as 15 a v surface area of packed bed volume of packed bed the specific surface a v of the packed bed in the current study is 267 m2 m3 the void fraction ε for a packed bed is defined as 16 ε volume of voids in bed total volume of bed voids plus solids experiments were performed to measure the void fraction of the structured packing used in the dcd accordingly the void fraction is 0 87 the equivalent diameter d for a channel is d 4r h while 17 r h ε 6 1 ε d p therefore reynolds number in a packed bed is as follows 18 re 4 ε 1 ε ρv μ a v where v is the average interstitial velocity in the bed for the gaseous flow it equals 19 v g a c schmidt number is the ratio of viscous diffusion rate and mass diffusion rate and is defined as 20 sc μ ρd in eq 20 d is mass diffusivity in a ternary ideal gas mixture where component 1 is being absorbed from a mixture of components 1 2 and 3 by a non volatile liquid in a wetted wall column operating at 1 atm the effective diffusion rate of component 1 can be estimated as described in 45 as follows 21 d 1 f 1 y 1 y 2 d 12 y 3 d 13 22 d 1 eff d 1 f z 0 d 1 f z δ 2 in the above equations y i is the concentration of component i z 0 represents boundary condition in bulk gas and z δ represents boundary condition in the interface the above equations are used in model development the developed correlation is then used to calculate sherwood number model predictions are compared with experimental values in fig 8 4 3 experiment results and discussion in the first batch of experiments different avrs for various cvrs were tested to study the effect of these parameters on ipa separation and water recovery while maintaining cooling water at 21 c fig 4 shows experiment results and illustrates that for all cvrs increasing the avr has a direct effect on ipa separation but a reverse effect on water recovery this is because the presence of a non condensable gas air in the mixture decreases the rate of heat transfer heat dissipation it also reduces the dew point temperature of the humid gaseous mixture therefore at the fixed cooling water temperature with a fixed cooling rate less amounts of condensable compounds such as ipa condenses conversely increasing the cvr leads to lower ipa separation increasing cvr is equivalent to increasing the rate of heat dissipation accordingly ipa condensation is more probable and less ipa is separated with air more experiments were performed to investigate the effects of avr on mass transfer inside the pb dcd operating at different re l as well as various temperatures of gaseous mixture entering the condenser mass transfer is defined in terms of sherwood number sh and some of the above experiments results are plotted in fig 5 sh is a dimensionless number which represents the ratio of convective mass transfer rate to the rate of diffusion mass transport in the current study the higher sh represents higher rate of ipa condensation or in other words lower ipa separation as explained above more presence of non condensable gas can assist separation of ipa from the mixture and results in sh in the second batch of experiments the effect of varying cvr on sh was investigated experiment results for two different re l are shown in fig 6 accordingly increasing the cvr increases sh this supports the hypothesis that improving the rate of heat dissipation in this case by increasing cvr more ipa condenses which results in larger values of sh finally in the third batch of experiments the effect of reynolds number re g on ipa mass transfer was investigated sherwood number sh which is defined for the liquid phase and represents the coefficient of convective mass transfer rate of ipa to its diffusion rate into water is computed as explained in section 4 2 as illustrated in fig 7 a at fixed cvrs and avrs increasing re g leads to a reduction in ipa separation and therefore an increase in sh comparing two different avrs of 1 0 and 0 5 at cvr 8 in fig 7 b demonstrates that ipa mass transfer at lower avr is more sensitive to the re g compared to that at higher avrs experimental results shown in fig 5 also support the fact that increasing cvrs results in lower ipa separation in the pb dcd fig 7 illustrates that increasing re g leads to an increase in mass transfer coefficient f and sh which corresponds to smaller ipa separation varying flowrates of air cooling water and contaminated water in these experiments also allows study of the effects of varying the schmidt number on ipa mass transfer in summary performing these parametric studies allowed for the investigation of relationships between the pi groups sherwood number reynolds number schmidt number avr and cvr as explained before the modified sherwood correlation is expressed as a function of schmidt number liquid and gas phase reynolds number as well as avr and cvr as shown in eq 12 to determine constants and exponents in eq 12 different optimization methods such as genetic algorithm have been examined to fit experimental data finally the optimization problem using experimental data was solved by applying the nelder mead simplex algorithm 46 47 to minimize the mean absolute percentage error mape which is defined as follows 23 mape 1 n t 1 n sh exp sh model sh exp the optimization objective function was solved for unknown coefficients in the modified sherwood correlation model finding constant coefficients from optimization the empirical correlation for the modified sherwood number is provided with mean absolute error equal to 6 6 the empirical correlation to model the ipa mass transfer from a ternary gaseous mixture to water is expressed in the following form 24 sh 2 63 10 3 re g 0 35 re l 0 83 sc 0 10 av r 0 39 cvr 0 60 this correlation is valid for re g in the range of 400 2500 and re l range from 25 to 130 the model only depends on the inlet information such as operating temperatures and flowrates to obtain the sherwood number using eq 7 mass transfer coefficient of ipa f can be calculated from a predicted sherwood number considering the exponents of non dimensional parameters in eq 24 it is understood that reynolds and schmidt numbers as well as cvr have direct effect on larger mass transfer coefficient of ipa from the gaseous mixture to the liquid phase on the contrary avr has an inverse effect on the mass transfer coefficient among the reinforcing parameters re l has the biggest effect on the sh or in other words the mass transfer coefficient f figs 5 and 6 support this fact similarly in fig 7 b indicates that for a fixed re g and cvr increasing the avr can significantly reduce the mass transfer coefficient and sh number it was found that increasing the schmidt number has a direct effect on the mass transfer coefficient of ipa as mentioned before schmidt number is a function of three thermodynamic properties viscosity density and diffusivity in the current study coolprop was used to define the viscosity and density of mixtures as a function of temperature pressure and composition therefore schmidt number implicitly depends on temperature of gaseous mixture as well as partial pressure of ipa in theory it is expected that at higher partial pressure of ipa more of it condenses and goes into the water phase considering eqs 21 and 22 higher partial pressure of ipa corresponds to larger values of ipa concentration y 1 which means smaller values of diffusivity coefficient and as a result larger values of schmidt number according to the presented modified sherwood correlation increasing sc leads to an increase of sherwood and as a result larger mass transfer coefficient of ipa hence a positive value for the exponent of sc in the presented sh correlation completely supports the aforementioned hypothesis similarly a higher avr corresponds to a lower partial pressure of ipa which means larger diffusivity coefficient consequently smaller schmidt number corresponds to a larger sherwood number and this supports the hypothesis as well residence time is another significant parameter that was studied residence time can be calculated by dividing bed height by interstitial velocity in the bed as explained in section 4 2 for a fixed packing size and bed height residence time is proportional to the inverse of velocity and reynolds number therefore at a higher velocity which corresponds to a larger re residence time is smaller as a result lower separation rate is achieved in other words at a higher velocity i e lower residence time less voc can be separated in gas phase which results in a larger mass transfer and diffusion rate to the liquid phase i e larger sh this hypothesis is supported by experiment results shown in fig 7 the proposed correlation is used to estimate sh number based on the operating condition of the system and inlet streams fig 8 shows the predicted sherwood versus the experimental values of sherwood the mean absolute percentage error is 6 6 in addition more than 86 of the predicted sherwood values are within a 10 relative error 5 conclusion the goal of this study is to experimentally investigate how a direct contact dehumidifier can separate contaminant from a gaseous mixture and develop an empirical model to predict the mass transfer coefficient of ipa into the water phase and estimate the water quality a packed bed direct contact dehumidifier was designed and fabricated experiments were performed to separate contaminant from gaseous mixture using the packed bed dehumidifier designed and constructed for this research a direct contact approach in the condenser of dehumidifier was chosen to maximize the heat recovery from fluid streams experimental results show that the process can successfully remove a significant fraction of contaminants from water according to the experimental results a maximum ipa separation of 76 3 was achieved by operating at avr 1 45 and cvr 5 4 this corresponds to sh 4 69 and re g 1611 the obtained water recovery at this condition was 58 7 parametric analysis was conducted to study the effect of air to vapor and cooling water to vapor mass ratios as well as residence time on the condensation rate and the condensate composition of a multicomponent gaseous mixture in a counter current packed bed direct contact dehumidifier this allowed for development of a mass transfer correlation to describe the process a modified sherwood correlation was presented that uses the operating condition of the system as well as thermodynamic properties and composition of inlet streams to predict the mass transfer coefficient of ipa the modified sherwood correlation was successfully used to predict the sherwood number with a mean absolute error of 6 6 it was found that the obtained constants and exponents for the sherwood correlation support the hypothesis that higher partial pressure of ipa and lower temperature of gaseous mixture or lower rate of heat dissipation due to smaller heat transfer driving force are two key parameters that lead to a larger mass transfer coefficient of ipa and as a result larger sherwood number the two new non dimensional parameters i e avr and cvr presented were found to improve the modified sherwood correlation future work will involve expanding the applicability range of the correlation and validating it for a wider range of reynolds and schmidt numbers as well as other non dimensional parameters furthermore experiments and parametric study will be conducted to test water contaminated with various contaminants including vocs and heavy organics that may be found in oil and gas wastewater there are more challenges for developing a broader model that can be applicable for a multicomponent mixture some of the difficulties are multi component and multiphase problem non equilibrium thermodynamics due to a dynamic process and complex configuration the above characteristics create a very complex problem the ultimate goal is to develop a method to model the mass transfer rate in a multicomponent mixture such as highly contaminated wastewater and optimize the introduced pb dcd for treatment of such wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest in the research funding publishing or any other aspect of this paper acknowledgments this research was made
