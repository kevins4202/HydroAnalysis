9590,efficient best management practices bmps must be both economically and technically feasible however designing adequate bmp planning by considering the trade offs between efficacy and cost effectiveness is considerably challenging for reducing the environmental impact of soil erosion to comprehensively evaluate and screen the efficacy and cost effectiveness of six selected bmps we integrated the entropy weight method with the calibrated soil and water assessment tool swat model the results demonstrate that i the hybrid use of the swat model and the entropy weight method can affordably help refine existing and future bmps watershed management plans should be adjusted according to the wet season and critical source areas csas because all bmps show differences in the reduction efficiency of soil erosion under different hydrological seasons and csas ii agricultural bmps and tree planting can effectively control soil erosion the reduction rankings in the whole watershed were as follows 15 returning farmland to forest 32 16 residue cover tillage 25 06 strip tillage 16 43 25 returning farmland to forest 8 96 contour tillage 8 75 and no tillage 3 18 the reduction in soil erosion in the wet season was 17 62 times higher than that in the dry season priority and reasonable allocation of bmps in the wet season can be made according to the timely situation and local conditions of the yanhe river watershed iii the reduction effects of various bmps on soil erosion in different csas are different the highest comprehensive evaluation index of both efficacy and cost effectiveness among the six bmps was scored by residue cover tillage which we recommend to be popularized in csas of the yanhe river watershed in areas with different erosion intensities strip tillage was also highly efficient that is the cost was low and the reduction effect adequate hence it is also suitable for large scale popularization some cultivated lands on the 15 slope can be selectively returned to forest supplemented by conservation tillage practices such as strip tillage residue cover tillage and contour tillage the introduced framework can be adapted as a suitable tool for selecting cost effective conservation practices in different regions by managing efficacy and cost trade offs keywords reduction efficiency entropy weight method critical source areas agricultural bmps tree planting 1 introduction since bennet et al founded soil conservation in the early 1930s gilley and flanagan 2007 soil and water conservation measures represented by returning farmland to forest grassland and conservation tillage have received extensive attention sun et al 2020 wen 2019 chen 2019 best management practices bmps are a series of engineering or non engineering measures to reduce and control soil and nutrient loss xie et al 2015 typical bmps are returning farmland to forest grassland and conservation tillage whereby the former focuses on the concept of connectivity and the latter aims to improve the health of the soil and its functions lu 2016 traditional field test methods for large scale regions are time consuming and expensive the use of model simulation to evaluate bmps has become an international hotspot chang 2017 wu et al 2018 control of water soil and nutrient loss based on bmps in the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been widely used and has achieved adequate results ran 2018 zheng 2019 however swat has rarely been used to compare the performance of various bmps in erosion control under different hydrological seasons and critical source areas rao et al 2009 a major challenge for realizing the optimization of bmps is appropriately selecting specific allocation schemes in specific watersheds by investigating efficiency and cost effective trade offs best management practices bmps such as terraces horizontal terraces fish scale pits grassed waterways strip cropping horizontal ditch and reforestation as well as conservation tillage such as contour tillage strip tillage residue cover tillage rotation intercropping and no till farming systems have been widely used in croplands mtibaa et al 2018 madarász et al 2021 these can address the source of the problem the outcome of the problem or both li et al 2021 for example contour farming is a soil solution considered to reduce surface runoff by intercepting and reducing runoff velocity this bmp effectively reduces the erosive power of surface runoff and prevents or minimizes the development of rills and sheet erosion guto et al 2011 the measures of returning farmland to forest grassland can increase the vegetation coverage in the watershed strengthen the water interception of the canopy soil consolidation and infiltration of underground roots and realize water and soil conservation bai 2014 hou et al 2016 wang and feng 2017 studied the runoff and sediment characteristics of the yanhe river watershed from 1960 to 2010 and found that returning farmland to forest significantly reduced the average annual and seasonal flood runoff runoff coefficient and sediment transport studies by shao 2013 in the weihe river basin showed that terrace measures could store flood and remedy drought prevent sediment deposition and evidently control soil erosion and river sediment transport cao 2017 studied the impact of long term conservation tillage on water and soil loss based on the long term positioning test in shenmu region shaanxi province from 2008 to 2016 and demonstrated that conservation tillage has broad application prospects in preventing and controlling water and soil loss intercepting soil nutrients and controlling nonpoint source nps pollution jayakody et al 2014 assessed the impact of four bmps and their combinations on the uprw basin using the swat model and found that the riparian buffer zone had little impact on reducing flow sediment and nutrients the vegetation filter strip was very effective in reducing flow sediment and nutrient yield and the combination of four bmps reduced flow sediment and nutrient yield by 51 55 44 and 88 respectively however the reduction effect and implementation cost of each bmp are different in different areas of soil erosion intensity areas yang et al 2010 when selecting appropriate bmps we must comprehensively consider cost and environmental benefits for more accurate assessments of bmp effectiveness to meet targeted goals li et al 2021 yuan and koropeckyj cox 2022 in other words when controlling water and soil loss the cost of measure should be reduced such that for a given measure cost the reduction effect of the measure is most adequate mtibaa et al 2018 the evaluation methods of environmental and economic benefits have been widely used but the cost benefit indicators selected by different scholars are different chang 2017 wang et al 2009 panagopoulos et al 2012 to avoid the subjective impact of artificially determining the index weight on the cost benefit evaluation the weight of the entropy weight method is determined by fully evaluating the actual situation of each index data which can effectively avoid the deviation caused by human factors and objectively reflect the internal differences between data cheng et al 2020 combined with the entropy weight method wang et al 2013 comprehensively evaluated and optimized the bmp measures in the danjiangkou reservoir basin after comprehensively considering the cost cultivated land occupation control effect and other factors of various measures yin 2016 comprehensively evaluated 11 types of bmps in the liaohe river basin based on the entropy weight method and found that strip tillage has a high comprehensive evaluation index for reducing runoff sediment nitrogen and phosphorus and the required economic cost is low the objectives of this study were to i assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of sediment yield in the yanhe river watershed in the loess hilly and gully regions using the calibrated swat model ii investigate the effects of six different bmps on sediment reduction using the swat model in different wet dry seasons and different critical source areas csas in order to recommend the most appropriate one iii evaluate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of bmps for controlling soil erosion by integrating the entropy weight method with the swat model the simulation results modeling methodologies and cost effective approach can help create agricultural bmp strategies to cost effectively control soil erosion in arid and semi arid regions 2 materials and method 2 1 study region and sloping farmland erosion the yanhe river watershed is located in the north of shaanxi province and belongs to the loess hilly and gully region of the loess plateau its specific geographical location is between 108 39 e 110 29e and 36 22 n 37 20 n fig 1 the total area of the yanhe river watershed is approximately 7725 km2 the terrain of the yanhe river watershed is higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast the average altitude average gradient and average slope are 1213 m 3 and 17 respectively from the source to the estuary the yanhe river is divided into upper middle and lower reaches with huaziping and ganguyi as the division the upper middle and lower reaches are the loessial hilly and gully area with many ridges and loessial hills hilly and gully areas with many hills and the downstream crushing plateau area the yanhe river watershed is located in a continental monsoon climate area with significant interannual differences in precipitation and a very uneven distribution within the year the annual average precipitation over many years has been 482 3 mm and is highly concentrated in summer and autumn the runoff of the yanhe river watershed mainly depends on precipitation recharge the interannual variation is more intense than precipitation and the annual difference is very apparent short duration and fierce floods often occur during the wet season may october runoff in the wet season accounts for over 90 of the entire year loessial soil is the most widely distributed soil type on the top of ridges slopes tablelands and ditches in the yanhe river watershed accounting for 85 of the total area loessial soil is cultivated in watersheds the soil texture is loose and the particle size is mainly silt which is easily eroded by rainfall runoff the main type of soil erosion in the watershed is water erosion and the area of water and soil loss accounts for 92 7 of the total watershed area the main causes of soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed are poor gully landforms summer rainstorm scouring and extensive sloping farmlands first according to the results of the national soil erosion survey in 2000 the erosion area above the intensive erosion 50 80 t ha of the yanhe river watershed reached 60 this can be attributed to the poor erosion resistance of loessial soil which accounts for over 85 of the drainage area in the watershed li and zheng 2012 second over 95 of the sediment in the region is eroded during the rainy season from june to october xu et al 2012 third the estimated averages for the early and middle period of grain for green project in steep areas indicated that the annual sediment yield was 6800 t km 2 for the slope croplands including the terraced areas in 2000 but was only 150 t km 2 for forestlands and 440 t km 2 for grasslands in 2015 respectively yang and lu 2018 more importantly the land use types with the most important erosion source in the yanhe river watershed mainly include dry land middle coverage grassland and low coverage grassland wu et al 2016 where moderate erosion 2500 5000 t km 2 and intensive erosion 5000 8000 t km 2 in dry land accounted for 53 71 and 9 24 of the total dry land area in 1995 according to statistics 68 91 of sloping farmland is 15 25 in china and 31 09 is 25 a potentially critical slope classification for the significant transfer of the highest contribution ratio when the sediment yield rate was 3000 t km 2 in the yanhe river watershed might be 15 20 wu et al 2020c wu et al 2020a this study used the basic data of the yanhe river

swat model swat is an acronym for the soil and water assessment tool which is a continuous time physically based computationally efficient model that enables users to study long term impacts arnold et al 1998 the land phase of the hydrologic cycle controls the amount of water sediment nutrients and pesticide loadings to the main channel in each subbasin the hydrologic cycle simulated by the swat is

measure of the degree of order of a system the larger the entropy the more chaotic the system is while the smaller the entropy the more orderly the system is therefore information entropy can be used to represent the amount of useful information provided by the known information the larger the entropy value the less useful information the known information provides and the smaller the role it plays in judgment and decision making the smaller the entropy the more useful information provided by the known information and the greater the effect on the comprehensive evaluation gao 2015 the entropy weight method is based on this principle to objectively weigh each evaluation index the entropy weight method is used to comprehensively evaluate various bmps to provide a reference for the optimization of measures the specific steps are as follows selection of evaluation factors for bmps the bmps and the corresponding evaluation factors are constructed into a decision matrix a a ij n m where a ij is the jth evaluation factor of the ith bmps n is the number of bmps and m is the number of evaluation factors ii standardized decision matrix a the range standardization method is used to standardize decision matrix a to eliminate the influence of dimension on the evaluation results the value of the benefit factor should be as large as possible as such the standardized formula is 3 r ij a ij min i a ij max i a ij min i a ij for the cost factor the smaller the value the better the standardized formula is as follows 4 r ij max i a ij a ij max i a ij min i a ij through the standardization of benefit and cost factors the standardized decision matrix r composed of n bmps and m evaluation factors was obtained as follows 5 r r ij n m r 11 r 12 r 1 m r 21 r 22 r 2 m r n 1 r

calibration in the modeling process using arcswat 2012 the dem grid was added to arcmap view with a mask area and the default value 15 095 hm2 was set as the threshold area for stream and sub catchment definitions the outlet hydrological station ganguyi was added to the river channel to divide it into a total of 27 sub watersheds based on the main watershed outlet selection and definition the land use soil and slope definition options in the hru analysis menu were then used to determine the hydrologic response unit hru distribution in each sub watershed where the multiple slope button in the hru analysis menu was selected to classify the slope into eight levels the create hrus button was utilized to delineate hru distribution by modifying the threshold land use soil slope area percentage over the subbasin area and a total of 148 hrus were generated then input tables for swat by weather data definition were all written after completing the above data input we clicked rewrite swat input files under edit swat input to write all the input data then we ran the model using the run swat option under swat simulation the warm up period of the model was 1989 1990 the calibration period was 1991 1995 and the validation period was 1996 1997 among them the calibration and validation for the sediment load were performed with observational data from may to october rather than for all months as was done for runoff the nsga ii method developed by ercan and goodall 2016 was adopted to synchronously calibrate the runoff and sediment parameters of the swat model the specific operators in the nsga ii algorithm mainly include non dominated sorting crowding distance sorting selection crossover and mutation deb et al 2002 specifically the non dominated sorting operator is a process for ranking solutions that exist in the combined population bekele and nicklow 2007 at the cut off point for inclusion in the parent population crowding distance sorting is used to break ties for solutions with the same rank lu et al 2014 selection crossover and mutation are continuous processes that choose solutions from a parent population that create a child population based on non dominated and crowding distance sorting values which can find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true pareto optimal front khu and madsen 2005 in the application for swat calibration the nsga2 mid cmd file is a batch file that executes a series of commands for swat calibration it uses swat executable swat exe and two python scripts swat parameteredit py and extract rch py to create the model file in this study with the help of the swat input and output manual abbaspour et al 2007 12 parameters related to runoff and eight parameters related to sediment were selected to calibrate the model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were set as the objective functions to calibrate the runoff and sediment parameters of the swat model using the nsga ii algorithm 12 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q avg 2 13 pbias i 1 n q o i q s i 100 i 1 n q o i where q o i is the measured flow m3 s q s i is the simulated flow m3 s q avg is the average measured flow m3 s and q savg is the average simulated flow m3 s nse is between and 1 including 1 where nse 1 is the best parameter value the best pbias value was 0 the smaller the absolute pbias value the higher the simulation accuracy in this study if nse 0 5 pbias is between 25 and 25 and the simulation accuracy is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 calibration and validation of the swat model output with observed monthly runoff and sediment are shown for the yanhe river watershed in fig 2 the nses of monthly runoff in the ganguyi hydrological station were 0 67 and 0 52 and pbias was 2 05 and 0 17 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the nses of monthly sediment from may to october in the ganguyi hydrological station were 0 67 and 0 64 and pbias was 3 13 and 15 91 respectively the data show that the nses of runoff and sediment in the ganguyi hydrological station were both greater than 0 5 both pbias values were within 25 indicating that the synchronous calibration methodology of runoff and sediment parameters based on non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii not only has strong adaptability in the yanhe river watershed but can also improve the calibration efficiency of the swat model notably the runoff fitting effect in the wet season from may to october was better than that in the dry season november to april of the ganguyi hydrological station this phenomenon can be attributed to two reasons first the swat model uses the curve number method developed by the usda soil conservation service scs cn to calculate cumulative surface runoff with time such that month to month variation in curve numbers can be found a few factors in the dry season are considered in the equation especially for rainfed agricultural watersheds liew and garbrecht 2003 second the objective functions considered when calibrating parameters namely nse and pbias estimate the overall simulation effect are more sensitive to the peak value and may not accurately reflect the simulation effect in the dry season gebremariam et al 2014 among the parameters related to monthly runoff in the yanhe river watershed the parameters of initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 baseflow alpha factor alpha bf effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium ch k2 and soil evaporation compensation factor esco are highly sensitive table 1 cn2 is a parameter directly related to the scs curve number method and is the most important parameter in swat hydrological simulations gassman 2007 in different periods the sensitivity of cn2 was different this is because cn2 is greatly affected by precipitation verma et al 2017 when precipitation is concentrated infiltration excess overland flow on moderate to steep slopes in arid and semi arid areas exists resulting in an increase in the sensitivity of cn2 zhou et al 2019 ch k2 is a parameter that controls the transmission loss of surface runoff chen et al 2019 in the wet season due to the increase in runoff volume the transmission loss increases accordingly and the transmission loss has a stronger impact on runoff than that in the dry season wu et al 2020c wu et al 2020a similarly the sensitivity of cn2 in the dry season november february was much lower than that in other months during the calibration process of sediment this is because cn2 is closely related to the calculation of rainfall erosivity whereas the erosive rainfall in the yanhe river watershed is mainly concentrated during the wet season zhao et al 2008 cn2 average slope length slsubbsn usle equation support practice factor usle p minimum value of usle c factor for water erosion applicable to the land cover plant usle c and usle equation soil erodibility k factor usle k are directly related to the calculation of musle the high sensitivity of these parameters shows that land erosion has a significant impact on the final river sediment transport russo 2015 2 5 scenario design and reduction rate considering that cultivated land dry land is the main land use type of water and soil loss in the yanhe river watershed bmps can be implemented in terms of changing farming modes agricultural measures and landscape management returning farmland to forest under the land use types in 1995 43 35 dry land through parametric setting bmps in the swat model can provide a basic framework for soil and water conservation measure simulation and technology integration arabi et al 2008 referring to the swat input output file documentation version 2012 we designed six bmps scenarios table 2 the edit swat input menu in arcswat interface can be used to make input modifications during the model calibration process and to alter the default swat input data during the scenario modeling period the primary file used to summarize the land and water management practices is the hru management file mgt cn2 mgt and usle p mgt are the general management parameters that belong to inputs for initial conditions or management practices to edit the management file input data we click on the mgt in the select input file section of the edit subbasin inputs edit subbasin inputs dialog box after the usle p mgt in the edit swat input menu was set completely it can be extended to different slopes according to the slope classification set in the project creation stage of hru analysis the plant growth database distributed with swat includes parameters for the most common plant species plant dat usle c plant dat is a plant growth database file that reflects the minimum value of the usle c factor for water erosion applicable to land covers plants a general procedure is to select the edit databases button under the edit swat input menu such that the database of land cover plant growth can be chosen for editing the hru general input file contains information related to the diversity of features within the hru hru ov n hru belongs to the hru input file with land cover characteristics to edit general hru data we click on the hru extension in the select input file section of the edit subbasin inputs dialog box among them conservation tillage mainly reduced soil erosion and pollutant production by changing micro terrain contour tillage and increasing ground cover strip tillage residue cover tillage and no tillage to slow down and reduce surface runoff contouring is most effective on slopes of 3 8 stripcropping is a practice in which contoured strips of sod are alternated with equal width strips of row crops or small grains runoff curve numbers cn2 for cultivated agricultural lands were determined by the contoured terraced residue row crops under different hydrological conditions of the yanhe river watershed the usle p values for contour tillage contour farming terraced fields and strip tillage were determined according to the different land slopes of the yanhe river watershed the usle p value for residue cover tillage was determined by referencing the contour stripcropping for 4 year rotation of the row crop the usle c value was averaged using the minimum usle c factor for different land cover plants values of manning s roughness coefficient ov n for overland flow were determined by characteristics of land surface no till 2 9 t ha residue the range of manning s n value for overland flow ov n is 0 17 0 47 with a median of 0 3 engman 1983 landscape management mainly aims to reduce soil erosion and pollutants by changing land use patterns wang et al 2013 the spatial distribution of land use types after returning farmland to forestland uses the swat model to simulate the effects of returning farmland to forestland on soil erosion zheng 2019 the specific steps are as follows first use the slope tool 3d analyst tools raster surface slope in 3d analyst extensions in arcmap input dem and get the slope grid map of the watershed then use the grid calculator spatial analyst tools map algebra raster calculator in the spatial analysis tool to input the land use and slope grid map and set the conditional grid calculation formula such as con slope 15 land use con land use cultivated land forest land land use or con slope 25 land use con land use cultivated land grassland land use thus the land use grid map of returning farmland to forest 15 or 25 was obtained table 3 after obtaining the land use map after returning farmland to forest grassland we kept other modeling conditions unchanged loaded the new land use type re established the model conducted simulations and modified the model parameters to the calibrated parameter values to obtain the simulation results after returning farmland to forest grassland the seasonal reduction rate in the wet and dry seasons and the annual reduction rate of each measure were calculated the formula for the reduction rate can be expressed as 14 r l pre l post l pre 100 where r is the reduction rate l pre and l post are the erosion amounts before and after the implementation of bmps respectively 2 6 cost and benefit indicators 2 6 1 cost indicators input cost is essential in the decision making of bmps therefore the annual input cost is considered to be the cost indicator table 4 i cost of agricultural bmps referring to relevant literature wang et al 2013 yin 2016 the cost of no tillage was 600 ha the cost of strip tillage was 375 ha the cost of contour tillage was 750 ha and the cost of residue cover tillage was 900 ha ii cost of returning farmland to forests according to the national measures for the management of funds for the ecological protection and restoration of forestry and grassland in 2020 1350 will be subsidized per hectare of return farmland every year in the yellow river basin the subsidy period of ecological forest is eight years and that of economic forest is five years the subsidy for returning farmland to forest is 18 000 ha which is paid in three phases within five years 7500 ha in the first year 4500 ha in the third year and 6000 ha in the fifth year for the convenience of calculation the national subsidy cost for returning farmland to forest was converted to 4950 ha the total implementing area of agricultural bmps is 3352 54 km2 which is larger than that of returning farmland to forest this is because conservation tillage is applied to all cultivated land while returning farmland to forest is only applied to sloping cultivated land however the unit cost of returning farmland to forest is much higher than that of agricultural bmps hence the total cost of 15 returning farmland to forest is higher than that of agricultural bmps overall the total cost of various bmps from large to small is as follows returning farmland to forest 15 residue cover tillage contour tillage no tillage strip tillage returning farmland to forest 25 2 6 2 benefit indicators of bmps the total reduction amount was defined as the benefit indicator when implementing various bmps in the entire watershed the annual average benefit indicators of bmps in different soil erosion intensity areas were statistically calculated and are shown in table 4 the reduction amount of 25 returning farmland to forest is better than no tillage close to contour tillage and has an evident effect on soil and water conservation the 15 return of farmland to forest is adequate for conservation of water and soil which can reduce 30 of sediment under the baseline scenario but returning all farmland to forest can significantly reduce the area of cultivated land and affect food security wang et al 2013 according to luan 2008 studies on sloping farmland on the loess plateau sloping farmland gradually evolved into bare land owing to the poor soil conservation performance of vegetation and some topsoil was washed away therefore all sloping farmland with a slope of 25 should be returned to forest while for sloping farmland with a slope of 15 25 comprehensive bmps such as returning farmland to forest and agricultural bmps should be implemented synchronously 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of hydrological variables during the baseline period 3 1 1 temporal characteristics the monthly rainfall runoff sediment and their proportions throughout the year were calculated as shown in fig 3 the statistically monthly rainfall runoff and sediment by swat model from 1991 to 2012 are 3 18 120 83 mm 13 56 104 m3 6469 104 m3 and 0 94 104 t 2384 59 104 t respectively the ratios of the maximum and minimum values of monthly rainfall monthly runoff and monthly sediment are 37 98 476 9 and 2534 88 respectively with an extremely uneven distribution over the year compared with monthly rainfall both monthly runoff and monthly sediment showed a more evident difference in the year the multi year monthly average rainfall runoff and sediment in the yanhe river watershed showed a single peak trend fig 3 precipitation runoff and sediment gradually increased from january to august and decreased from august to december the trends of rainfall runoff and sediment are basically similar reaching a peak in august accounting for 23 45 34 07 and 28 92 of the whole year respectively in addition there are significant differences in rainfall runoff and sediment during the wet season from may to october and dry season from november to april the interannual soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed fluctuates greatly and is concentrated during the wet season in the wet season the contribution rates of rainfall runoff and sediment to the whole year were 87 34 94 82 and 94 79 respectively most notably heavy rainstorms with short durations often occurred during the wet season scouring and eroding the soil resulting in serious soil and water loss therefore the implementation of bmps in the wet season should be more beneficial to water and soil conservation in the yanhe river watershed 3 1 2 spatial characteristics the rainfall runoff depth and sediment yield of 27 sub basins from 1991 to 2012 were simulated using the calibrated swat model the maximum values of rainfall water yield and sediment yield in the watershed are 543 74 mm sub basin 4 284 20 mm sub basin 7 and 157 69 t ha sub basin 16 respectively in addition the standard deviations of rainfall water yield and sediment yield are 26 52 mm 40 88 mm and 35 94 t ha respectively indicating that there are significant differences in spatial distribution more importantly the regional difference in sediment yield was significantly higher than that of rainfall and water yield and the ratio of the maximum value to the minimum value was 5 19 whereas the ratios of runoff and rainfall were only 1 12 and 1 82 according to the classification standard of soil erosion intensity in the northwest loess plateau the intensity of soil erosion in the sub watershed is divided into four categories moderate 25 50 t ha intense 50 80 t ha extremely intense 80 150 t ha and severe 150 t ha according to the classification results over 20 of the sub basins in the watershed face severe erosion risk fig 4 which is consistent with the study of soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed in 1997 by wang et al 2007 according to the idea of determining the critical source area by the unit area load method the sub watershed with the highest soil erosion intensity is determined to be the key source area chang 2017 the primary source areas of sediment loss were determined to be sub basins 4 7 8 13 16 and 24 with severe erosion we can see that the erosion intensity of the yanhe river watershed is strong in the middle followed by the north and weak in the south which is consistent with previous research on the spatial distribution of soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed wang 2014 therefore the spatial characteristics of erosion intensity are strong in the middle followed by the north and weakest in the south it is necessary to implement bmps based on the critical source areas in the yanhe river watershed according to the simulation results the water yield and sediment yield of the different land use types were statistically calculated as shown in table 5 as the hru threshold was defined during modeling some secondary land use types were merged and the main land use types after pixel merging were cultivated land grassland forestland and residential area respectively among them grassland and cultivated land were the main land use types of the watershed with an area of 3 531 86 km2 and 3 352 55 km2 accounting for 46 79 and 44 42 of the total watershed area respectively among the various land use types the sediment yield and water yield of forest land and residential areas are low the main reason for this is that forest land can conserve water sources and has a strong role in soil conservation wu et al 2002 however residential areas contain high impervious pavement with strong impermeability this underlying surface has a certain water production capacity and contributes little to sediment yield among several land use types grassland and cultivated land contributed the most to sediment and water yield reaching 48 49 and 64 99 respectively the water yield of cultivated land and grassland accounted for 96 19 of the entire watershed and the sediment yield accounted for 97 96 which is the main source of soil and water loss in the watershed grassland has a strong ability in terms of water yield and sediment yield which is related to its large area and low coverage qin et al 2009 cultivated land is the main source of water yield especially sediment yield and the results confirmed that erosion and nutrient losses were significantly affected by soil properties and higher in both agricultural land and barren land qiu et al 2019 special attention should be paid to cultivated land when configuring bmps 3 2 reduction effectiveness of different bmps 3 2 1 different time periods after configuring different bmps in the entire watershed the sediment yield by the swat model was counted and compared with the base period the reduction rates of each bmp at different times are shown in fig 5 the reduction amount of bmps in each month differed significantly and the reduction in the wet season was much greater than that in the dry season the ratios of reduction amount between wet season and dry season were 18 94 17 52 17 69 18 15 15 68 and 17 73 for no tillage nt contour tillage ct strip tillage st residue cover tillage rc 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 and 25 returning farmland to forest rfr25 respectively with an average of 17 62 which is nearly equivalent to the ratio of total sediment yield in wet season and dry season of the baseline scenario of 18 19 in addition the reduction effects of the different bmps were significantly different the average annual reductions in nt ct st rc rfr15 and rfr25 reached 262 14 721 514 1 354 319 2 065 989 2 651 309 and 699 554 104 t respectively in general the reduction rate of rfr15 returning farmland to forest with slope 15 was the highest among all bmps reaching 32 16 the reduction effects of other bmps were rc 25 06 st 16 43 rfr25 8 96 ct 8 75 and nt 3 18 the reduction effect of each bmp has evident seasonal variation and the reduction amount in the wet season is much higher than that in the dry season 3 2 2 different sub watersheds the reduction efficiency of different bmps in each sub watershed was significantly different from that in the baseline scenario fig 6 compared with fig 4 the distribution of soil erosion intensity changed significantly under the six scenarios the number of watersheds with four types of soil erosion intensity changed significantly and the changes in soil erosion intensity by different bmps were different overall the entire watershed was difficult to control and the control cost was relatively high because of the large scope of water and soil loss which were implemented in key source areas first and then extended according to the actual situation of other areas in the baseline scenario sub basins 4 7 8 13 16 and 24 were the critical source areas compared with figs 4 and 6 we can see that the soil erosion intensity of each critical source area decreased to varying degrees after the implementation of bmps among them the intensity of soil erosion in sub basins no 7 8 and 24 decreased from severe 150 t ha to extremely intense 80 150 t ha under the five bmps under the rfr15 scenario the reduction rate of the no 8 critical source area reached 36 and the soil erosion intensity reduced to intensive erosion 50 80 t ha however the effects of bmps on some critical source areas were not clear for example the critical source areas of no 4 and no 16 remained severely eroded under the condition of no tillage and the erosion level of the no 13 key source area did not decrease under the rfr25 scenario in general each bmp in different critical source areas had a certain role in curbing soil and water loss but the reduction rate of soil erosion by different bmps was different and the effects of bmps in different critical source areas were not completely consistent 3 3 efficacy and cost effectiveness of bmps for controlling sediment yield 3 3 1 different hydrological seasons according to the results of cost and benefit factors the weight of the benefit factor was determined as 0 65 in the wet season while in the dry season the weight of the cost and benefit factors decreased to 0 61 this is because the reduction in water and soil conservation measures in the wet season was significantly higher than that in the dry season but the cost remained basically unchanged furthermore the comprehensive evaluation indices of bmps in different periods are calculated by the entropy weight method with the aim of multi attribute decision making as shown in table 6 we can see from the whole watershed that the order of effectiveness of various bmps in the dry season is returning farmland to forest 25 rfr25 residue cover tillage rc returning farmland to forest 15 rfr15 strip tillage st contour tillage ct no tillage nt in the wet season this was residue cover tillage returning farmland to forest 15 strip tillage returning farmland to forest 25 contour tillage no tillage in the wet season the comprehensive evaluation of residue cover tillage and strip tillage was higher than that in the dry season indicating that these two bmps were more effective for sediment reduction in the wet season which can be considered emphatically in the wet season 3 3 2 different soil erosion intensity zones there are evident differences in the comprehensive evaluation indices of various bmps in different soil erosion intensity areas table 6 for areas with moderate erosion the preferred bmp is 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 for intense and extremely intense erosion areas the preferred bmp is residue cover tillage rc and for severe erosion areas the preferred bmp is recommended as a combination of residue cover tillage rc and 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 it is noteworthy that the comprehensive evaluation indices of strip tillage st in intense extremely intense and severely eroded areas are high and its cost has evident advantages over other measures which is suitable for large scale popularization the comprehensive index of 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 in the moderate erosion intensity area is higher than that in other areas which is related to the entropy weight change of various factors in different erosion intensity areas the entropy weight of the benefit factors of bmps in the moderate erosion intensity area is 0 74 which is higher than that of the measures in the intense extreme intense and severe areas by 0 63 0 65 and 0 67 respectively therefore in the moderate intensity area the implementation of 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 can significantly reduce costs and improve the reduction efficiency of soil erosion compared with other measures 4 discussion 4 1 reduction efficiency of different bmps compared with the baseline scenario the reduction efficiencies of different bmps in each sub watershed are evidently different through the statistics of reduction rates in different sub watersheds but each bmp has a certain role in curbing soil and water loss fig 7 under the three scenarios of no tillage nt contour tillage ct and strip tillage st the reduction rates of soil erosion in different sub watersheds were 2 6 5 3 8 3 9 9 and 16 17 4 respectively and the average reduction rates were 3 4 8 8 and 16 4 respectively the standard deviations among the sub watersheds were 0 71 0 28 and 0 25 respectively indicating that all the above three scenarios have a positive effect on soil and water conservation bensalah and abida 2016 but the difference in reduction efficiency among different sub watersheds is relatively small under the same bmp this is related to the spatial configuration of bmps and depends on whether they can play an important role between upstream and downstream mtibaa et al 2018 for example the positive effect of no tillage nt on erosion control can be attributed to the soil holding capacity of roots and stems alvaro fuentes et al 2008 contour tillage ct is a structural practice useful for decreasing sheet and rill erosion ullrich and volk 2009 strip tillage st can be implemented on sloping lands by minimizing soil erosion as a result of the stems and roots holding the soil on steep slopes together wagena and easton 2018 although the effect of conservation tillage on water erosion control is relatively limited it has the benefit of improving soil humidity in semi arid areas for yield growth and can often be used in combination with contour framing strip cropping cover crops and other bmps de vita et al 2007 this phenomenon also indirectly proves that cn2 does not act on sediment alone when the precipitation is low november february and that its impact on sediment depends on hydrological processes such as surface runoff walega and salata 2019 the reduction rate of residue cover tillage rc is 22 55 32 86 the average reduction rate was 25 9 and the standard deviation among sub watersheds was 2 41 this is because crop residue management provides mulch to reduce the erosive force of raindrop impact and slow runoff allowing more water to soak into the soil park et al 2014 compared with no tillage nt contour tillage ct and strip tillage st increased residues limit for soil disturbing activities which decreases the amount of soil particles washed out by rainfall and runoff wallace et al 2017 the effectiveness of residue cover tillage rc on sediment reduction is consistent with the results of wang et al 2013 indicating that the use of rc on agricultural land can potentially significantly improve control and limitation of soil erosion jeon et al 2018 in fact the sensitivity of cn2 and ch k2 is significant in the wet season may to october in the loess plateau of the yellow river zhou et al 2019 the curve number may be updated in plant tillage and harvest kill operations because the scs curve number is a function of the soil s permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions karunanidhi et al 2020 moreover the peak runoff and soil erosion reduced as manning s n value for overland flow ov n increased ullrich and volk 2009 the reduction effect of returning farmland to forest on different slopes was significantly different the reduction rate under 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 was 24 18 48 06 and the average reduction rate was 34 7 while the reduction rate under 25 returning farmland to forest rfr25 was only 0 14 3 with an average reduction rate of 8 3 the difference between these two scenarios is primarily related to the spatial distribution of sloping cultivated land the area of 25 sloping cultivated land only accounts for approximately 3 of the total cultivated land in the watershed and is far less than that of 15 however 25 returning farmland to forest rfr25 shows an evident sediment reduction effect returning farmland to forest can be recommended for all cultivated land on the 25 slope which supports the idea that reforestation is an effective practice in steep sloped areas ricci et al 2022 this is because steep slopes are most sensitive to land use change thus these areas have to be converted to forestland in order to maximize the effect on soil erosion zhang et al 2014 the implementation of 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 showed a greater reduction 30 of sediment yield referred to a single sub watershed because of the change in land use from one that is prone to soil erosion to one that minimizes it ricci et al 2018 however rfr15 may also greatly reduce cultivated land area and affect food security this phenomenon occurs because the cultivated land on the 15 slope accounts for approximately 42 7 of the total cultivated land area in the yanhe river watershed in addition under the rfr15 and rfr25 scenarios the standard deviations of the reduction rates among the sub watersheds were 4 92 and 4 19 respectively however the reduction rates of different sub watersheds were significantly different under the scenario of returning farmland to forest which may be attributed to the efficiency of bmps being dependent on the designed parameters and local factors which varied in different sub basins qiu et al 2019 more importantly the impact of each bmp is site specific and dependent on the implementation site in the watershed naseri et al 2021 and the reduced area of sloping farmland in each sub watershed is different after returning farmland to forest the above comparative results are consistent with those of uniyal et al 2020 who found that landscape bmps 0 66 70 are more effectual than agricultural bmps 2 7 in minimizing sediment yields at the watershed level this phenomenon occurs because forests can decrease the effect of raindrop splashes and improve soil protection from detachment with surface litter xiao et al 2015 this also confirms that the establishment of plant cover is one of the most effective measures for erosion control and regeneration of degraded soil zuazo et al 2008 cultivated land below 15 covers a wide range in the yanhe river watershed which has a high risk of soil and water loss as there are many erosive rainstorms in the wet season of the watershed we suggest that some cultivated lands on the 15 slope be selectively returned to forest according to the local conditions supplemented by conservation tillage practices such as strip tillage st residue cover tillage rc and contour tillage ct according to the wishes of farmers this is because the combination of contour tillage ct and reforestation is an effective practice 38 reduction for erosion control ricci et al 2020 4 2 best co management of the watershed determining individual bmp impacts is important for identifying bmps that really have or are likely to have an impact on soil erosion reduction gitau et al 2008 in the entire watershed the reduction effects of various bmps were as follows 15 returning farmland to forest 32 16 residue cover tillage 25 06 strip tillage 16 43 25 returning farmland to forest 8 96 contour tillage 8 75 and no tillage 3 18 however the order of implementation cost was returning farmland to forest 15 rfr15 residue cover tillage rc contour tillage ct no tillage nt strip tillage st returning farmland to forest 25 rfr25 notably the comprehensive evaluation indices of residue cover tillage rc and strip tillage st in the wet season were significantly higher than those in the dry season indicating that these two bmps are more effective for erosion reduction in semiarid and arid regions with extremely uneven monthly rainfall which we can extensively recommend in the wet season to avoid the risk of damage during intense rainfall zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 the comprehensive evaluation indices of strip tillage st in intense extremely intense and severe erosion areas are high indicating that strip tillage st was the most effective approach in terms of soil erosion reduction and economic benefits and is suitable for large scale popularization because of its low cost and adequate reduction effect overall bmps implemented in series which decreased erosion and pollutant loads more than individual bmps were not as cost effective as certain individual bmps kaufman et al 2021 this may be because the implementation of upstream bmps lowered the concentrations of pollutants in the flow making downstream bmps less effective liu et al 2016 however studies have shown that the most cost effective option is to implement bmps one by one in critical areas based on their individual cost effectiveness rankings liu et al 2019 evident differences exist in the reduction effects of different bmps on soil erosion in different hydrological periods and different critical source areas briak et al 2019 first the effects of each bmp have evident seasonal variation and the wet season is a critical period for the control of soil loss the configuration of bmps should heed to seasonal differences in precipitation because the reduction amount of each measure in the wet season is significantly higher than that in the dry season and targeted measures should be taken according to the timely situation of the watershed notably the sensitivity of the slsubbsn usle p usle c and usle k parameters depends on the change in precipitation which usually exhibits strong interactive sensitivity in months with large precipitation july august and september wu et al 2022 second implementing bmps in critical source areas can be prioritized because of the large scope of soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b wu et al 2020c therefore bmps should be configured according to seasonal rainfall in combination with the local erosion conditions of the watershed for micro and mild erosion areas conservation tillage practices such as no till can be adopted because the no till practice increases water storage and holds the soil together significantly by decreasing evapotranspiration and increasing infiltration soane et al 2012 for moderate erosion areas the suitable bmp is 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 because the change in land use from cultivated land to forest in the hilly and gully regions can represent a good solution in steep slopes where conventional tillage is not sustainable zhang et al 2014 specifically the conversion of cropland to forestland on sloped land is part of a national ecological recovery program in china wu et al 2019 which has many significant ecological impacts including minimizing of soil erosion and vegetation degradation increasing soil moisture reducing runoff and improving water quality through the interception of sediment or other pollutants by vegetation huang et al 2017 for intense and extremely intense erosion areas a suitable bmp is residue cover tillage rc and for severely eroded areas the combination of residue cover tillage rc and 15 we recommend returning farmland to forest rfr15 as a suitable bmp this case only studied and evaluated the efficiencies and cost effectiveness of some agricultural bmps and returned farmland to forest in fact a large number of other bmps and their combinations have been implemented in the loess plateau and adequate practical results have been achieved such as slope to terrace horizontal step fish scale pit horizontal ditch check dam etc cao 2017 ren 2018 sun et al 2020 wei 2017 notably implementing bmps in series was generally less effective than simply adding the pollutant reductions of individual bmps together in the actual configuration liu et al 2014 more evaluation indices should be considered with reference to the calculation method of benefits of comprehensive control of water and soil conservation gb t 15774 2008 guo 2017 for example xu et al 2016 considered the suitability degree basic benefits economic benefits social benefits and ecological benefits in the comprehensive evaluation of bmps in changting county the cost effectiveness of bmps depends on the location specific characteristics of the land on which they are applied panagopoulos et al 2013 for example the total cost of 15 returning farmland to forest in the whole watershed is higher than that of several agricultural bmps although the total area of conservation tillage measures is higher than that of returning farmland to forest this is because the unit cost of returning farmland to forest is much higher than that of conservation tillage therefore the cost and reduction benefits of combined bmps could be comprehensively evaluated by integrating the swat model with the entropy weight method in future studies this is not just because the implementation of combined bmps is recommended for a larger reduction in sediment yield yang et al 2021 more importantly controlling erosion is an essential aspect of preventing nutrient nonpoint source nps pollution of surface waters as eroding soil particles will carry excess nutrients kaini et al 2012 particularly phosphorous into water bodies 5 conclusions the soil water assessment tool swat was integrated with the entropy weight method to identify critical source areas csas and investigate the effectiveness of different best management practices bmps in reducing sediment yield in the yanhe river watershed such that bmp configuration schemes with practical guidance values were proposed the results indicate that i integrating the swat model with the entropy weight method is a suitable alternative analytical tool for the effective assessment of bmps in watershed management the framework developed for identifying implementation options for cost effective and environmentally protective strategies helps decision makers plan and track the application of bmps ii scenarios simulations with the swat model provide useful insights into what may happen the reduction effect of different bmps on soil erosion not only has evident seasonal variation but also shows spatial differences in different csas iii in either case good management is a necessary condition for reducing sloping erosion at all times both the physical effectiveness of measures and the socio economy should be considered for adoption because measures can be implemented only in cases where they are acceptable to stakeholders integrated techniques allowed us to evaluate the possible management practices most adapted to the actual conditions of agricultural land in the yanhe river watershed which can be extended to other watersheds for nps pollution management at the watershed scale by simultaneously managing storm water runoff trapping eroded land controlling erosion and sediment reduction

9590,efficient best management practices bmps must be both economically and technically feasible however designing adequate bmp planning by considering the trade offs between efficacy and cost effectiveness is considerably challenging for reducing the environmental impact of soil erosion to comprehensively evaluate and screen the efficacy and cost effectiveness of six selected bmps we integrated the entropy weight method with the calibrated soil and water assessment tool swat model the results demonstrate that i the hybrid use of the swat model and the entropy weight method can affordably help refine existing and future bmps watershed management plans should be adjusted according to the wet season and critical source areas csas because all bmps show differences in the reduction efficiency of soil erosion under different hydrological seasons and csas ii agricultural bmps and tree planting can effectively control soil erosion the reduction rankings in the whole watershed were as follows 15 returning farmland to forest 32 16 residue cover tillage 25 06 strip tillage 16 43 25 returning farmland to forest 8 96 contour tillage 8 75 and no tillage 3 18 the reduction in soil erosion in the wet season was 17 62 times higher than that in the dry season priority and reasonable allocation of bmps in the wet season can be made according to the timely situation and local conditions of the yanhe river watershed iii the reduction effects of various bmps on soil erosion in different csas are different the highest comprehensive evaluation index of both efficacy and cost effectiveness among the six bmps was scored by residue cover tillage which we recommend to be popularized in csas of the yanhe river watershed in areas with different erosion intensities strip tillage was also highly efficient that is the cost was low and the reduction effect adequate hence it is also suitable for large scale popularization some cultivated lands on the 15 slope can be selectively returned to forest supplemented by conservation tillage practices such as strip tillage residue cover tillage and contour tillage the introduced framework can be adapted as a suitable tool for selecting cost effective conservation practices in different regions by managing efficacy and cost trade offs keywords reduction efficiency entropy weight method critical source areas agricultural bmps tree planting 1 introduction since bennet et al founded soil conservation in the early 1930s gilley and flanagan 2007 soil and water conservation measures represented by returning farmland to forest grassland and conservation tillage have received extensive attention sun et al 2020 wen 2019 chen 2019 best management practices bmps are a series of engineering or non engineering measures to reduce and control soil and nutrient loss xie et al 2015 typical bmps are returning farmland to forest grassland and conservation tillage whereby the former focuses on the concept of connectivity and the latter aims to improve the health of the soil and its functions lu 2016 traditional field test methods for large scale regions are time consuming and expensive the use of model simulation to evaluate bmps has become an international hotspot chang 2017 wu et al 2018 control of water soil and nutrient loss based on bmps in the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been widely used and has achieved adequate results ran 2018 zheng 2019 however swat has rarely been used to compare the performance of various bmps in erosion control under different hydrological seasons and critical source areas rao et al 2009 a major challenge for realizing the optimization of bmps is appropriately selecting specific allocation schemes in specific watersheds by investigating efficiency and cost effective trade offs best management practices bmps such as terraces horizontal terraces fish scale pits grassed waterways strip cropping horizontal ditch and reforestation as well as conservation tillage such as contour tillage strip tillage residue cover tillage rotation intercropping and no till farming systems have been widely used in croplands mtibaa et al 2018 madarász et al 2021 these can address the source of the problem the outcome of the problem or both li et al 2021 for example contour farming is a soil solution considered to reduce surface runoff by intercepting and reducing runoff velocity this bmp effectively reduces the erosive power of surface runoff and prevents or minimizes the development of rills and sheet erosion guto et al 2011 the measures of returning farmland to forest grassland can increase the vegetation coverage in the watershed strengthen the water interception of the canopy soil consolidation and infiltration of underground roots and realize water and soil conservation bai 2014 hou et al 2016 wang and feng 2017 studied the runoff and sediment characteristics of the yanhe river watershed from 1960 to 2010 and found that returning farmland to forest significantly reduced the average annual and seasonal flood runoff runoff coefficient and sediment transport studies by shao 2013 in the weihe river basin showed that terrace measures could store flood and remedy drought prevent sediment deposition and evidently control soil erosion and river sediment transport cao 2017 studied the impact of long term conservation tillage on water and soil loss based on the long term positioning test in shenmu region shaanxi province from 2008 to 2016 and demonstrated that conservation tillage has broad application prospects in preventing and controlling water and soil loss intercepting soil nutrients and controlling nonpoint source nps pollution jayakody et al 2014 assessed the impact of four bmps and their combinations on the uprw basin using the swat model and found that the riparian buffer zone had little impact on reducing flow sediment and nutrients the vegetation filter strip was very effective in reducing flow sediment and nutrient yield and the combination of four bmps reduced flow sediment and nutrient yield by 51 55 44 and 88 respectively however the reduction effect and implementation cost of each bmp are different in different areas of soil erosion intensity areas yang et al 2010 when selecting appropriate bmps we must comprehensively consider cost and environmental benefits for more accurate assessments of bmp effectiveness to meet targeted goals li et al 2021 yuan and koropeckyj cox 2022 in other words when controlling water and soil loss the cost of measure should be reduced such that for a given measure cost the reduction effect of the measure is most adequate mtibaa et al 2018 the evaluation methods of environmental and economic benefits have been widely used but the cost benefit indicators selected by different scholars are different chang 2017 wang et al 2009 panagopoulos et al 2012 to avoid the subjective impact of artificially determining the index weight on the cost benefit evaluation the weight of the entropy weight method is determined by fully evaluating the actual situation of each index data which can effectively avoid the deviation caused by human factors and objectively reflect the internal differences between data cheng et al 2020 combined with the entropy weight method wang et al 2013 comprehensively evaluated and optimized the bmp measures in the danjiangkou reservoir basin after comprehensively considering the cost cultivated land occupation control effect and other factors of various measures yin 2016 comprehensively evaluated 11 types of bmps in the liaohe river basin based on the entropy weight method and found that strip tillage has a high comprehensive evaluation index for reducing runoff sediment nitrogen and phosphorus and the required economic cost is low the objectives of this study were to i assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of sediment yield in the yanhe river watershed in the loess hilly and gully regions using the calibrated swat model ii investigate the effects of six different bmps on sediment reduction using the swat model in different wet dry seasons and different critical source areas csas in order to recommend the most appropriate one iii evaluate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of bmps for controlling soil erosion by integrating the entropy weight method with the swat model the simulation results modeling methodologies and cost effective approach can help create agricultural bmp strategies to cost effectively control soil erosion in arid and semi arid regions 2 materials and method 2 1 study region and sloping farmland erosion the yanhe river watershed is located in the north of shaanxi province and belongs to the loess hilly and gully region of the loess plateau its specific geographical location is between 108 39 e 110 29e and 36 22 n 37 20 n fig 1 the total area of the yanhe river watershed is approximately 7725 km2 the terrain of the yanhe river watershed is higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast the average altitude average gradient and average slope are 1213 m 3 and 17 respectively from the source to the estuary the yanhe river is divided into upper middle and lower reaches with huaziping and ganguyi as the division the upper middle and lower reaches are the loessial hilly and gully area with many ridges and loessial hills hilly and gully areas with many hills and the downstream crushing plateau area the yanhe river watershed is located in a continental monsoon climate area with significant interannual differences in precipitation and a very uneven distribution within the year the annual average precipitation over many years has been 482 3 mm and is highly concentrated in summer and autumn the runoff of the yanhe river watershed mainly depends on precipitation recharge the interannual variation is more intense than precipitation and the annual difference is very apparent short duration and fierce floods often occur during the wet season may october runoff in the wet season accounts for over 90 of the entire year loessial soil is the most widely distributed soil type on the top of ridges slopes tablelands and ditches in the yanhe river watershed accounting for 85 of the total area loessial soil is cultivated in watersheds the soil texture is loose and the particle size is mainly silt which is easily eroded by rainfall runoff the main type of soil erosion in the watershed is water erosion and the area of water and soil loss accounts for 92 7 of the total watershed area the main causes of soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed are poor gully landforms summer rainstorm scouring and extensive sloping farmlands first according to the results of the national soil erosion survey in 2000 the erosion area above the intensive erosion 50 80 t ha of the yanhe river watershed reached 60 this can be attributed to the poor erosion resistance of loessial soil which accounts for over 85 of the drainage area in the watershed li and zheng 2012 second over 95 of the sediment in the region is eroded during the rainy season from june to october xu et al 2012 third the estimated averages for the early and middle period of grain for green project in steep areas indicated that the annual sediment yield was 6800 t km 2 for the slope croplands including the terraced areas in 2000 but was only 150 t km 2 for forestlands and 440 t km 2 for grasslands in 2015 respectively yang and lu 2018 more importantly the land use types with the most important erosion source in the yanhe river watershed mainly include dry land middle coverage grassland and low coverage grassland wu et al 2016 where moderate erosion 2500 5000 t km 2 and intensive erosion 5000 8000 t km 2 in dry land accounted for 53 71 and 9 24 of the total dry land area in 1995 according to statistics 68 91 of sloping farmland is 15 25 in china and 31 09 is 25 a potentially critical slope classification for the significant transfer of the highest contribution ratio when the sediment yield rate was 3000 t km 2 in the yanhe river watershed might be 15 20 wu et al 2020c wu et al 2020a this study used the basic data of the yanhe river

to represent the amount of useful information provided by the known information the larger the entropy value the less useful information the known information provides and the smaller the role it plays in judgment and decision making the smaller the entropy the more useful information provided by the known information and the greater the effect on the comprehensive evaluation gao 2015 the entropy weight method is based on this principle to objectively weigh each evaluation index the entropy weight method is used to comprehensively evaluate various bmps to provide a reference for the optimization of measures the specific steps are as follows selection of evaluation factors for bmps the bmps and the corresponding evaluation factors are constructed into a decision matrix a a ij n m where a ij is the jth evaluation factor of the ith bmps n is the number of bmps and m is the number of evaluation factors ii standardized decision matrix a the range standardization method is used to standardize decision matrix a to eliminate the influence of dimension on the evaluation results the value of the benefit factor should be as large as possible as such the standardized formula is 3 r ij a ij min i a ij max i a ij min i a ij for the cost factor the smaller the value the better the standardized formula is as follows 4 r ij max i a ij a ij max i a ij min i a ij through the standardization of benefit and cost factors the standardized decision matrix r composed of n bmps and m evaluation factors was obtained as follows 5 r r ij n m r 11 r 12 r 1 m r 21 r 22 r 2 m r n 1 r

calibration in the modeling process using arcswat 2012 the dem grid was added to arcmap view with a mask area and the default value 15 095 hm2 was set as the threshold area for stream and sub catchment definitions the outlet hydrological station ganguyi was added to the river channel to divide it into a total of 27 sub watersheds based on the main watershed outlet selection and definition the land use soil and slope definition options in the hru analysis menu were then used to determine the hydrologic response unit hru distribution in each sub watershed where the multiple slope button in the hru analysis menu was selected to classify the slope into eight levels the create hrus button was utilized to delineate hru distribution by modifying the threshold land use soil slope area percentage over the subbasin area and a total of 148 hrus were generated then input tables for swat by weather data definition were all written after completing the above data input we clicked rewrite swat input files under edit swat input to write all the input data then we ran the model using the run swat option under swat simulation the warm up period of the model was 1989 1990 the calibration period was 1991 1995 and the validation period was 1996 1997 among them the calibration and validation for the sediment load were performed with observational data from may to october rather than for all months as was done for runoff the nsga ii method developed by ercan and goodall 2016 was adopted to synchronously calibrate the runoff and sediment parameters of the swat model the specific operators in the nsga ii algorithm mainly include non dominated sorting crowding distance sorting selection crossover and mutation deb et al 2002 specifically the non dominated sorting operator is a process for ranking solutions that exist in the combined population bekele and nicklow 2007 at the cut off point for inclusion in the parent population crowding distance sorting is used to break ties for solutions with the same rank lu et al 2014 selection crossover and mutation are continuous processes that choose solutions from a parent population that create a child population based on non dominated and crowding distance sorting values which can find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true pareto optimal front khu and madsen 2005 in the application for swat calibration the nsga2 mid cmd file is a batch file that executes a series of commands for swat calibration it uses swat executable swat exe and two python scripts swat parameteredit py and extract rch py to create the model file in this study with the help of the swat input and output manual abbaspour et al 2007 12 parameters related to runoff and eight parameters related to sediment were selected to calibrate the model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were set as the objective functions to calibrate the runoff and sediment parameters of the swat model using the nsga ii algorithm 12 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q avg 2 13 pbias i 1 n q o i q s i 100 i 1 n q o i where q o i is the measured flow m3 s q s i is the simulated flow m3 s q avg is the average measured flow m3 s and q savg is the average simulated flow m3 s nse is between and 1 including 1 where nse 1 is the best parameter value the best pbias value was 0 the smaller the absolute pbias value the higher the simulation accuracy in this study if nse 0 5 pbias is between 25 and 25 and the simulation accuracy is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 calibration and validation of the swat model output with observed monthly runoff and sediment are shown for the yanhe river watershed in fig 2 the nses of monthly runoff in the ganguyi hydrological station were 0 67 and 0 52 and pbias was 2 05 and 0 17 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the nses of monthly sediment from may to october in the ganguyi hydrological station were 0 67 and 0 64 and pbias was 3 13 and 15 91 respectively the data show that the nses of runoff and sediment in the ganguyi hydrological station were both greater than 0 5 both pbias values were within 25 indicating that the synchronous calibration methodology of runoff and sediment parameters based on non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii not only has strong adaptability in the yanhe river watershed but can also improve the calibration efficiency of the swat model notably the runoff fitting effect in the wet season from may to october was better than that in the dry season november to april of the ganguyi hydrological station this phenomenon can be attributed to two reasons first the swat model uses the curve number method developed by the usda soil conservation service scs cn to calculate cumulative surface runoff with time such that month to month variation in curve numbers can be found a few factors in the dry season are considered in the equation especially for rainfed agricultural watersheds liew and garbrecht 2003 second the objective functions considered when calibrating parameters namely nse and pbias estimate the overall simulation effect are more sensitive to the peak value and may not accurately reflect the simulation effect in the dry season gebremariam et al 2014 among the parameters related to monthly runoff in the yanhe river watershed the parameters of initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 baseflow alpha factor alpha bf effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium ch k2 and soil evaporation compensation factor esco are highly sensitive table 1 cn2 is a parameter directly related to the scs curve number method and is the most important parameter in swat hydrological simulations gassman 2007 in different periods the sensitivity of cn2 was different this is because cn2 is greatly affected by precipitation verma et al 2017 when precipitation is concentrated infiltration excess overland flow on moderate to steep slopes in arid and semi arid areas exists resulting in an increase in the sensitivity of cn2 zhou et al 2019 ch k2 is a parameter that controls the transmission loss of surface runoff chen et al 2019 in the wet season due to the increase in runoff volume the transmission loss increases accordingly and the transmission loss has a stronger impact on runoff than that in the dry season wu et al 2020c wu et al 2020a similarly the sensitivity of cn2 in the dry season november february was much lower than that in other months during the calibration process of sediment this is because cn2 is closely related to the calculation of rainfall erosivity whereas the erosive rainfall in the yanhe river watershed is mainly concentrated during the wet season zhao et al 2008 cn2 average slope length slsubbsn usle equation support practice factor usle p minimum value of usle c factor for water erosion applicable to the land cover plant usle c and usle equation soil erodibility k factor usle k are directly related to the calculation of musle the high sensitivity of these parameters shows that land erosion has a significant impact on the final river sediment transport russo 2015 2 5 scenario design and reduction rate considering that cultivated land dry land is the main land use type of water and soil loss in the yanhe river watershed bmps can be implemented in terms of changing farming modes agricultural measures and landscape management returning farmland to forest under the land use types in 1995 43 35 dry land through parametric setting bmps in the swat model can provide a basic framework for soil and water conservation measure simulation and technology integration arabi et al 2008 referring to the swat input output file documentation version 2012 we designed six bmps scenarios table 2 the edit swat input menu in arcswat interface can be used to make input modifications during the model calibration process and to alter the default swat input data during the scenario modeling period the primary file used to summarize the land and water management practices is the hru management file mgt cn2 mgt and usle p mgt are the general management parameters that belong to inputs for initial conditions or management practices to edit the management file input data we click on the mgt in the select input file section of the edit subbasin inputs edit subbasin inputs dialog box after the usle p mgt in the edit swat input menu was set completely it can be extended to different slopes according to the slope classification set in the project creation stage of hru analysis the plant growth database distributed with swat includes parameters for the most common plant species plant dat usle c plant dat is a plant growth database file that reflects the minimum value of the usle c factor for water erosion applicable to land covers plants a general procedure is to select the edit databases button under the edit swat input menu such that the database of land cover plant growth can be chosen for editing the hru general input file contains information related to the diversity of features within the hru hru ov n hru belongs to the hru input file with land cover characteristics to edit general hru data we click on the hru extension in the select input file section of the edit subbasin inputs dialog box among them conservation tillage mainly reduced soil erosion and pollutant production by changing micro terrain contour tillage and increasing ground cover strip tillage residue cover tillage and no tillage to slow down and reduce surface runoff contouring is most effective on slopes of 3 8 stripcropping is a practice in which contoured strips of sod are alternated with equal width strips of row crops or small grains runoff curve numbers cn2 for cultivated agricultural lands were determined by the contoured terraced residue row crops under different hydrological conditions of the yanhe river watershed the usle p values for contour tillage contour farming terraced fields and strip tillage were determined according to the different land slopes of the yanhe river watershed the usle p value for residue cover tillage was determined by referencing the contour stripcropping for 4 year rotation of the row crop the usle c value was averaged using the minimum usle c factor for different land cover plants values of manning s roughness coefficient ov n for overland flow were determined by characteristics of land surface no till 2 9 t ha residue the range of manning s n value for overland flow ov n is 0 17 0 47 with a median of 0 3 engman 1983 landscape management mainly aims to reduce soil erosion and pollutants by changing land use patterns wang et al 2013 the spatial distribution of land use types after returning farmland to forestland uses the swat model to simulate the effects of returning farmland to forestland on soil erosion zheng 2019 the specific steps are as follows first use the slope tool 3d analyst tools raster surface slope in 3d analyst extensions in arcmap input dem and get the slope grid map of the watershed then use the grid calculator spatial analyst tools map algebra raster calculator in the spatial analysis tool to input the land use and slope grid map and set the conditional grid calculation formula such as con slope 15 land use con land use cultivated land forest land land use or con slope 25 land use con land use cultivated land grassland land use thus the land use grid map of returning farmland to forest 15 or 25 was obtained table 3 after obtaining the land use map after returning farmland to forest grassland we kept other modeling conditions unchanged loaded the new land use type re established the model conducted simulations and modified the model parameters to the calibrated parameter values to obtain the simulation results after returning farmland to forest grassland the seasonal reduction rate in the wet and dry seasons and the annual reduction rate of each measure were calculated the formula for the reduction rate can be expressed as 14 r l pre l post l pre 100 where r is the reduction rate l pre and l post are the erosion amounts before and after the implementation of bmps respectively 2 6 cost and benefit indicators 2 6 1 cost indicators input cost is essential in the decision making of bmps therefore the annual input cost is considered to be the cost indicator table 4 i cost of agricultural bmps referring to relevant literature wang et al 2013 yin 2016 the cost of no tillage was 600 ha the cost of strip tillage was 375 ha the cost of contour tillage was 750 ha and the cost of residue cover tillage was 900 ha ii cost of returning farmland to forests according to the national measures for the management of funds for the ecological protection and restoration of forestry and grassland in 2020 1350 will be subsidized per hectare of return farmland every year in the yellow river basin the subsidy period of ecological forest is eight years and that of economic forest is five years the subsidy for returning farmland to forest is 18 000 ha which is paid in three phases within five years 7500 ha in the first year 4500 ha in the third year and 6000 ha in the fifth year for the convenience of calculation the national subsidy cost for returning farmland to forest was converted to 4950 ha the total implementing area of agricultural bmps is 3352 54 km2 which is larger than that of returning farmland to forest this is because conservation tillage is applied to all cultivated land while returning farmland to forest is only applied to sloping cultivated land however the unit cost of returning farmland to forest is much higher than that of agricultural bmps hence the total cost of 15 returning farmland to forest is higher than that of agricultural bmps overall the total cost of various bmps from large to small is as follows returning farmland to forest 15 residue cover tillage contour tillage no tillage strip tillage returning farmland to forest 25 2 6 2 benefit indicators of bmps the total reduction amount was defined as the benefit indicator when implementing various bmps in the entire watershed the annual average benefit indicators of bmps in different soil erosion intensity areas were statistically calculated and are shown in table 4 the reduction amount of 25 returning farmland to forest is better than no tillage close to contour tillage and has an evident effect on soil and water conservation the 15 return of farmland to forest is adequate for conservation of water and soil which can reduce 30 of sediment under the baseline scenario but returning all farmland to forest can significantly reduce the area of cultivated land and affect food security wang et al 2013 according to luan 2008 studies on sloping farmland on the loess plateau sloping farmland gradually evolved into bare land owing to the poor soil conservation performance of vegetation and some topsoil was washed away therefore all sloping farmland with a slope of 25 should be returned to forest while for sloping farmland with a slope of 15 25 comprehensive bmps such as returning farmland to forest and agricultural bmps should be implemented synchronously 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of hydrological variables during the baseline period 3 1 1 temporal characteristics the monthly rainfall runoff sediment and their proportions throughout the year were calculated as shown in fig 3 the statistically monthly rainfall runoff and sediment by swat model from 1991 to 2012 are 3 18 120 83 mm 13 56 104 m3 6469 104 m3 and 0 94 104 t 2384 59 104 t respectively the ratios of the maximum and minimum values of monthly rainfall monthly runoff and monthly sediment are 37 98 476 9 and 2534 88 respectively with an extremely uneven distribution over the year compared with monthly rainfall both monthly runoff and monthly sediment showed a more evident difference in the year the multi year monthly average rainfall runoff and sediment in the yanhe river watershed showed a single peak trend fig 3 precipitation runoff and sediment gradually increased from january to august and decreased from august to december the trends of rainfall runoff and sediment are basically similar reaching a peak in august accounting for 23 45 34 07 and 28 92 of the whole year respectively in addition there are significant differences in rainfall runoff and sediment during the wet season from may to october and dry season from november to april the interannual soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed fluctuates greatly and is concentrated during the wet season in the wet season the contribution rates of rainfall runoff and sediment to the whole year were 87 34 94 82 and 94 79 respectively most notably heavy rainstorms with short durations often occurred during the wet season scouring and eroding the soil resulting in serious soil and water loss therefore the implementation of bmps in the wet season should be more beneficial to water and soil conservation in the yanhe river watershed 3 1 2 spatial characteristics the rainfall runoff depth and sediment yield of 27 sub basins from 1991 to 2012 were simulated using the calibrated swat model the maximum values of rainfall water yield and sediment yield in the watershed are 543 74 mm sub basin 4 284 20 mm sub basin 7 and 157 69 t ha sub basin 16 respectively in addition the standard deviations of rainfall water yield and sediment yield are 26 52 mm 40 88 mm and 35 94 t ha respectively indicating that there are significant differences in spatial distribution more importantly the regional difference in sediment yield was significantly higher than that of rainfall and water yield and the ratio of the maximum value to the minimum value was 5 19 whereas the ratios of runoff and rainfall were only 1 12 and 1 82 according to the classification standard of soil erosion intensity in the northwest loess plateau the intensity of soil erosion in the sub watershed is divided into four categories moderate 25 50 t ha intense 50 80 t ha extremely intense 80 150 t ha and severe 150 t ha according to the classification results over 20 of the sub basins in the watershed face severe erosion risk fig 4 which is consistent with the study of soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed in 1997 by wang et al 2007 according to the idea of determining the critical source area by the unit area load method the sub watershed with the highest soil erosion intensity is determined to be the key source area chang 2017 the primary source areas of sediment loss were determined to be sub basins 4 7 8 13 16 and 24 with severe erosion we can see that the erosion intensity of the yanhe river watershed is strong in the middle followed by the north and weak in the south which is consistent with previous research on the spatial distribution of soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed wang 2014 therefore the spatial characteristics of erosion intensity are strong in the middle followed by the north and weakest in the south it is necessary to implement bmps based on the critical source areas in the yanhe river watershed according to the simulation results the water yield and sediment yield of the different land use types were statistically calculated as shown in table 5 as the hru threshold was defined during modeling some secondary land use types were merged and the main land use types after pixel merging were cultivated land grassland forestland and residential area respectively among them grassland and cultivated land were the main land use types of the watershed with an area of 3 531 86 km2 and 3 352 55 km2 accounting for 46 79 and 44 42 of the total watershed area respectively among the various land use types the sediment yield and water yield of forest land and residential areas are low the main reason for this is that forest land can conserve water sources and has a strong role in soil conservation wu et al 2002 however residential areas contain high impervious pavement with strong impermeability this underlying surface has a certain water production capacity and contributes little to sediment yield among several land use types grassland and cultivated land contributed the most to sediment and water yield reaching 48 49 and 64 99 respectively the water yield of cultivated land and grassland accounted for 96 19 of the entire watershed and the sediment yield accounted for 97 96 which is the main source of soil and water loss in the watershed grassland has a strong ability in terms of water yield and sediment yield which is related to its large area and low coverage qin et al 2009 cultivated land is the main source of water yield especially sediment yield and the results confirmed that erosion and nutrient losses were significantly affected by soil properties and higher in both agricultural land and barren land qiu et al 2019 special attention should be paid to cultivated land when configuring bmps 3 2 reduction effectiveness of different bmps 3 2 1 different time periods after configuring different bmps in the entire watershed the sediment yield by the swat model was counted and compared with the base period the reduction rates of each bmp at different times are shown in fig 5 the reduction amount of bmps in each month differed significantly and the reduction in the wet season was much greater than that in the dry season the ratios of reduction amount between wet season and dry season were 18 94 17 52 17 69 18 15 15 68 and 17 73 for no tillage nt contour tillage ct strip tillage st residue cover tillage rc 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 and 25 returning farmland to forest rfr25 respectively with an average of 17 62 which is nearly equivalent to the ratio of total sediment yield in wet season and dry season of the baseline scenario of 18 19 in addition the reduction effects of the different bmps were significantly different the average annual reductions in nt ct st rc rfr15 and rfr25 reached 262 14 721 514 1 354 319 2 065 989 2 651 309 and 699 554 104 t respectively in general the reduction rate of rfr15 returning farmland to forest with slope 15 was the highest among all bmps reaching 32 16 the reduction effects of other bmps were rc 25 06 st 16 43 rfr25 8 96 ct 8 75 and nt 3 18 the reduction effect of each bmp has evident seasonal variation and the reduction amount in the wet season is much higher than that in the dry season 3 2 2 different sub watersheds the reduction efficiency of different bmps in each sub watershed was significantly different from that in the baseline scenario fig 6 compared with fig 4 the distribution of soil erosion intensity changed significantly under the six scenarios the number of watersheds with four types of soil erosion intensity changed significantly and the changes in soil erosion intensity by different bmps were different overall the entire watershed was difficult to control and the control cost was relatively high because of the large scope of water and soil loss which were implemented in key source areas first and then extended according to the actual situation of other areas in the baseline scenario sub basins 4 7 8 13 16 and 24 were the critical source areas compared with figs 4 and 6 we can see that the soil erosion intensity of each critical source area decreased to varying degrees after the implementation of bmps among them the intensity of soil erosion in sub basins no 7 8 and 24 decreased from severe 150 t ha to extremely intense 80 150 t ha under the five bmps under the rfr15 scenario the reduction rate of the no 8 critical source area reached 36 and the soil erosion intensity reduced to intensive erosion 50 80 t ha however the effects of bmps on some critical source areas were not clear for example the critical source areas of no 4 and no 16 remained severely eroded under the condition of no tillage and the erosion level of the no 13 key source area did not decrease under the rfr25 scenario in general each bmp in different critical source areas had a certain role in curbing soil and water loss but the reduction rate of soil erosion by different bmps was different and the effects of bmps in different critical source areas were not completely consistent 3 3 efficacy and cost effectiveness of bmps for controlling sediment yield 3 3 1 different hydrological seasons according to the results of cost and benefit factors the weight of the benefit factor was determined as 0 65 in the wet season while in the dry season the weight of the cost and benefit factors decreased to 0 61 this is because the reduction in water and soil conservation measures in the wet season was significantly higher than that in the dry season but the cost remained basically unchanged furthermore the comprehensive evaluation indices of bmps in different periods are calculated by the entropy weight method with the aim of multi attribute decision making as shown in table 6 we can see from the whole watershed that the order of effectiveness of various bmps in the dry season is returning farmland to forest 25 rfr25 residue cover tillage rc returning farmland to forest 15 rfr15 strip tillage st contour tillage ct no tillage nt in the wet season this was residue cover tillage returning farmland to forest 15 strip tillage returning farmland to forest 25 contour tillage no tillage in the wet season the comprehensive evaluation of residue cover tillage and strip tillage was higher than that in the dry season indicating that these two bmps were more effective for sediment reduction in the wet season which can be considered emphatically in the wet season 3 3 2 different soil erosion intensity zones there are evident differences in the comprehensive evaluation indices of various bmps in different soil erosion intensity areas table 6 for areas with moderate erosion the preferred bmp is 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 for intense and extremely intense erosion areas the preferred bmp is residue cover tillage rc and for severe erosion areas the preferred bmp is recommended as a combination of residue cover tillage rc and 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 it is noteworthy that the comprehensive evaluation indices of strip tillage st in intense extremely intense and severely eroded areas are high and its cost has evident advantages over other measures which is suitable for large scale popularization the comprehensive index of 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 in the moderate erosion intensity area is higher than that in other areas which is related to the entropy weight change of various factors in different erosion intensity areas the entropy weight of the benefit factors of bmps in the moderate erosion intensity area is 0 74 which is higher than that of the measures in the intense extreme intense and severe areas by 0 63 0 65 and 0 67 respectively therefore in the moderate intensity area the implementation of 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 can significantly reduce costs and improve the reduction efficiency of soil erosion compared with other measures 4 discussion 4 1 reduction efficiency of different bmps compared with the baseline scenario the reduction efficiencies of different bmps in each sub watershed are evidently different through the statistics of reduction rates in different sub watersheds but each bmp has a certain role in curbing soil and water loss fig 7 under the three scenarios of no tillage nt contour tillage ct and strip tillage st the reduction rates of soil erosion in different sub watersheds were 2 6 5 3 8 3 9 9 and 16 17 4 respectively and the average reduction rates were 3 4 8 8 and 16 4 respectively the standard deviations among the sub watersheds were 0 71 0 28 and 0 25 respectively indicating that all the above three scenarios have a positive effect on soil and water conservation bensalah and abida 2016 but the difference in reduction efficiency among different sub watersheds is relatively small under the same bmp this is related to the spatial configuration of bmps and depends on whether they can play an important role between upstream and downstream mtibaa et al 2018 for example the positive effect of no tillage nt on erosion control can be attributed to the soil holding capacity of roots and stems alvaro fuentes et al 2008 contour tillage ct is a structural practice useful for decreasing sheet and rill erosion ullrich and volk 2009 strip tillage st can be implemented on sloping lands by minimizing soil erosion as a result of the stems and roots holding the soil on steep slopes together wagena and easton 2018 although the effect of conservation tillage on water erosion control is relatively limited it has the benefit of improving soil humidity in semi arid areas for yield growth and can often be used in combination with contour framing strip cropping cover crops and other bmps de vita et al 2007 this phenomenon also indirectly proves that cn2 does not act on sediment alone when the precipitation is low november february and that its impact on sediment depends on hydrological processes such as surface runoff walega and salata 2019 the reduction rate of residue cover tillage rc is 22 55 32 86 the average reduction rate was 25 9 and the standard deviation among sub watersheds was 2 41 this is because crop residue management provides mulch to reduce the erosive force of raindrop impact and slow runoff allowing more water to soak into the soil park et al 2014 compared with no tillage nt contour tillage ct and strip tillage st increased residues limit for soil disturbing activities which decreases the amount of soil particles washed out by rainfall and runoff wallace et al 2017 the effectiveness of residue cover tillage rc on sediment reduction is consistent with the results of wang et al 2013 indicating that the use of rc on agricultural land can potentially significantly improve control and limitation of soil erosion jeon et al 2018 in fact the sensitivity of cn2 and ch k2 is significant in the wet season may to october in the loess plateau of the yellow river zhou et al 2019 the curve number may be updated in plant tillage and harvest kill operations because the scs curve number is a function of the soil s permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions karunanidhi et al 2020 moreover the peak runoff and soil erosion reduced as manning s n value for overland flow ov n increased ullrich and volk 2009 the reduction effect of returning farmland to forest on different slopes was significantly different the reduction rate under 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 was 24 18 48 06 and the average reduction rate was 34 7 while the reduction rate under 25 returning farmland to forest rfr25 was only 0 14 3 with an average reduction rate of 8 3 the difference between these two scenarios is primarily related to the spatial distribution of sloping cultivated land the area of 25 sloping cultivated land only accounts for approximately 3 of the total cultivated land in the watershed and is far less than that of 15 however 25 returning farmland to forest rfr25 shows an evident sediment reduction effect returning farmland to forest can be recommended for all cultivated land on the 25 slope which supports the idea that reforestation is an effective practice in steep sloped areas ricci et al 2022 this is because steep slopes are most sensitive to land use change thus these areas have to be converted to forestland in order to maximize the effect on soil erosion zhang et al 2014 the implementation of 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 showed a greater reduction 30 of sediment yield referred to a single sub watershed because of the change in land use from one that is prone to soil erosion to one that minimizes it ricci et al 2018 however rfr15 may also greatly reduce cultivated land area and affect food security this phenomenon occurs because the cultivated land on the 15 slope accounts for approximately 42 7 of the total cultivated land area in the yanhe river watershed in addition under the rfr15 and rfr25 scenarios the standard deviations of the reduction rates among the sub watersheds were 4 92 and 4 19 respectively however the reduction rates of different sub watersheds were significantly different under the scenario of returning farmland to forest which may be attributed to the efficiency of bmps being dependent on the designed parameters and local factors which varied in different sub basins qiu et al 2019 more importantly the impact of each bmp is site specific and dependent on the implementation site in the watershed naseri et al 2021 and the reduced area of sloping farmland in each sub watershed is different after returning farmland to forest the above comparative results are consistent with those of uniyal et al 2020 who found that landscape bmps 0 66 70 are more effectual than agricultural bmps 2 7 in minimizing sediment yields at the watershed level this phenomenon occurs because forests can decrease the effect of raindrop splashes and improve soil protection from detachment with surface litter xiao et al 2015 this also confirms that the establishment of plant cover is one of the most effective measures for erosion control and regeneration of degraded soil zuazo et al 2008 cultivated land below 15 covers a wide range in the yanhe river watershed which has a high risk of soil and water loss as there are many erosive rainstorms in the wet season of the watershed we suggest that some cultivated lands on the 15 slope be selectively returned to forest according to the local conditions supplemented by conservation tillage practices such as strip tillage st residue cover tillage rc and contour tillage ct according to the wishes of farmers this is because the combination of contour tillage ct and reforestation is an effective practice 38 reduction for erosion control ricci et al 2020 4 2 best co management of the watershed determining individual bmp impacts is important for identifying bmps that really have or are likely to have an impact on soil erosion reduction gitau et al 2008 in the entire watershed the reduction effects of various bmps were as follows 15 returning farmland to forest 32 16 residue cover tillage 25 06 strip tillage 16 43 25 returning farmland to forest 8 96 contour tillage 8 75 and no tillage 3 18 however the order of implementation cost was returning farmland to forest 15 rfr15 residue cover tillage rc contour tillage ct no tillage nt strip tillage st returning farmland to forest 25 rfr25 notably the comprehensive evaluation indices of residue cover tillage rc and strip tillage st in the wet season were significantly higher than those in the dry season indicating that these two bmps are more effective for erosion reduction in semiarid and arid regions with extremely uneven monthly rainfall which we can extensively recommend in the wet season to avoid the risk of damage during intense rainfall zuazo and pleguezuelo 2008 the comprehensive evaluation indices of strip tillage st in intense extremely intense and severe erosion areas are high indicating that strip tillage st was the most effective approach in terms of soil erosion reduction and economic benefits and is suitable for large scale popularization because of its low cost and adequate reduction effect overall bmps implemented in series which decreased erosion and pollutant loads more than individual bmps were not as cost effective as certain individual bmps kaufman et al 2021 this may be because the implementation of upstream bmps lowered the concentrations of pollutants in the flow making downstream bmps less effective liu et al 2016 however studies have shown that the most cost effective option is to implement bmps one by one in critical areas based on their individual cost effectiveness rankings liu et al 2019 evident differences exist in the reduction effects of different bmps on soil erosion in different hydrological periods and different critical source areas briak et al 2019 first the effects of each bmp have evident seasonal variation and the wet season is a critical period for the control of soil loss the configuration of bmps should heed to seasonal differences in precipitation because the reduction amount of each measure in the wet season is significantly higher than that in the dry season and targeted measures should be taken according to the timely situation of the watershed notably the sensitivity of the slsubbsn usle p usle c and usle k parameters depends on the change in precipitation which usually exhibits strong interactive sensitivity in months with large precipitation july august and september wu et al 2022 second implementing bmps in critical source areas can be prioritized because of the large scope of soil erosion in the yanhe river watershed wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b wu et al 2020c therefore bmps should be configured according to seasonal rainfall in combination with the local erosion conditions of the watershed for micro and mild erosion areas conservation tillage practices such as no till can be adopted because the no till practice increases water storage and holds the soil together significantly by decreasing evapotranspiration and increasing infiltration soane et al 2012 for moderate erosion areas the suitable bmp is 15 returning farmland to forest rfr15 because the change in land use from cultivated land to forest in the hilly and gully regions can represent a good solution in steep slopes where conventional tillage is not sustainable zhang et al 2014 specifically the conversion of cropland to forestland on sloped land is part of a national ecological recovery program in china wu et al 2019 which has many significant ecological impacts including minimizing of soil erosion and vegetation degradation increasing soil moisture reducing runoff and improving water quality through the interception of sediment or other pollutants by vegetation huang et al 2017 for intense and extremely intense erosion areas a suitable bmp is residue cover tillage rc and for severely eroded areas the combination of residue cover tillage rc and 15 we recommend returning farmland to forest rfr15 as a suitable bmp this case only studied and evaluated the efficiencies and cost effectiveness of some agricultural bmps and returned farmland to forest in fact a large number of other bmps and their combinations have been implemented in the loess plateau and adequate practical results have been achieved such as slope to terrace horizontal step fish scale pit horizontal ditch check dam etc cao 2017 ren 2018 sun et al 2020 wei 2017 notably implementing bmps in series was generally less effective than simply adding the pollutant reductions of individual bmps together in the actual configuration liu et al 2014 more evaluation indices should be considered with reference to the calculation method of benefits of comprehensive control of water and soil conservation gb t 15774 2008 guo 2017 for example xu et al 2016 considered the suitability degree basic benefits economic benefits social benefits and ecological benefits in the comprehensive evaluation of bmps in changting county the cost effectiveness of bmps depends on the location specific characteristics of the land on which they are applied panagopoulos et al 2013 for example the total cost of 15 returning farmland to forest in the whole watershed is higher than that of several agricultural bmps although the total area of conservation tillage measures is higher than that of returning farmland to forest this is because the unit cost of returning farmland to forest is much higher than that of conservation tillage therefore the cost and reduction benefits of combined bmps could be comprehensively evaluated by integrating the swat model with the entropy weight method in future studies this is not just because the implementation of combined bmps is recommended for a larger reduction in sediment yield yang et al 2021 more importantly controlling erosion is an essential aspect of preventing nutrient nonpoint source nps pollution of surface waters as eroding soil particles will carry excess nutrients kaini et al 2012 particularly phosphorous into water bodies 5 conclusions the soil water assessment tool swat was integrated with the entropy weight method to identify critical source areas csas and investigate the effectiveness of different best management practices bmps in reducing sediment yield in the yanhe river watershed such that bmp configuration schemes with practical guidance values were proposed the results indicate that i integrating the swat model with the entropy weight method is a suitable alternative analytical tool for the effective assessment of bmps in watershed management the framework developed for identifying implementation options for cost effective and environmentally protective strategies helps decision makers plan and track the application of bmps ii scenarios simulations with the swat model provide useful insights into what may happen the reduction effect of different bmps on soil erosion not only has evident seasonal variation but also shows spatial differences in different csas iii in either case good management is a necessary condition for reducing sloping erosion at all times both the physical effectiveness of measures and the socio economy should be considered for adoption because measures can be implemented only in cases where they are acceptable to stakeholders integrated techniques allowed us to evaluate the possible management practices most adapted to the actual conditions of agricultural land in the yanhe river watershed which can be extended to other watersheds for nps pollution management at the watershed scale by simultaneously managing storm water runoff trapping eroded land controlling erosion and sediment reduction

giordano 2014 nkoka et al 2014 woodhouse et al 2017 farmer led irrigation is defined as a process in which farmers drive the emergence and sustenance of irrigation development within a network of diverse actors veldwisch et al 2019 although these drivers vary from one area to another the main factors include the availability of water for irrigation and the ease of accessing this water through affordable technologies bosma 2015 de fraiture et al 2014 other factors include labor irrigation knowledge the availability of capital and the existence of suitable markets to sell farm produce beekman et al 2014 in semi arid areas where access to reliable surface water is limited shallow aquifers found within ephemeral sand rivers are a potential buffer against water scarcity during dry spells de hamer et al 2008 mansell and hussey 2005 sand river aquifers are recharged during storm periods sometimes taking just a few hours for the sand to be saturated but the recession of the stored water is usually slower and may occur over many months depending on the intensity of use mpala et al 2016 these aquifers are accessed by digging scoop holes in the river bed or shallow wells near the river banks and the water abstracted by a variety of manual or pumping technologies hussey 2007 sand rivers thus have the potential to provide water for irrigation to small farms over a large geographical area along the river banks love et al 2011 farmer led irrigation in frontier areas is market oriented and usually attracts actors from outside these regions who view it as an investment opportunity de bont et al 2019 migrant farmers bring new water management techniques and adapt them to local contexts woodhouse et al 2017 these actors engage in partnerships across social networks on their own terms scoones et al 2019 decision making at the farm level regarding the choice of crops production processes and preferred markets tend to be individualistic and entrepreneurial nkoka et al 2014 woodhouse et al 2017 ostrom 1993 identified key principles to enable the management of common pool resources such as community led irrigation schemes and ensure enduring irrigation institutions these include among others clearly defined system boundaries and water user rights collective choice of operational rules sanctions for violating these rules and conflict resolution mechanisms these principles do not apply to the entrepreneurial farmer led irrigation along sand rivers in arid and semi arid areas where self organization and minimal reliance on external support are important characteristics however external shocks such as economic downturns affecting input and output prices may lead to income losses forcing farmers to discontinue irrigation duker et al 2020 specialization in high value market crops increases the demand for land and raises costs to enter into this lucrative kind of irrigation locking out farmers without sufficient capital de bont et al 2019 in this paper we illustrate with a case study from the olkeriai sand river in kenya how migrant farmers mitigate these entrepreneurial risks by engaging in partnerships with landowners and capital providers these include formal written as well as informal verbal agreements migrant farmers with experience in the cultivation of irrigated high value crops form small groups and seek a financier for their farming venture so called tajiris individuals with adequate resources and willingness to invest but lacking farming knowledge provide all capital for farming and digging water abstraction points tajiris and farmer group split the profits 50 50 at the end of the season thereby also sharing the farm risks local landowners lease out their land directly adjacent to the sand river thereby also giving the right to abstract water from the river section within their land s boundaries we describe the characteristics of this popular tajiri partnership along the olkeriai sand river and explore how its transient nature has advanced irrigation development in previously uncultivated pastoral drylands we seek to understand the formal and informal interdependencies among actors who build entrepreneurial farming partnerships to derive benefits from natural resources found along the sand river while sharing risks associated with smallholder irrigated agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and focus kajiado county is located on kenya s southern border with tanzania and most of its area lies in semi arid and arid agro climatic zones with a bimodal annual rainfall between 300 mm and 800 mm when the rainfall is concentrated bobadoye et al 2014 in the south of the county near the slopes of mt kilimanjaro some areas are classified as medium to high potential zones with an annual precipitation of up to 1250 mm mwangi 2016 the major river systems in the kajiado are the olkeriai river toroka river and the olkejuado river all seasonal rivers county government of kajiado 2018 the main inhabitants of kajiado are the maasai traditional pastoralists who have lived in the area for many generations keeping livestock as their main livelihood crop cultivation in kajiado county was introduced in high potential areas such as loitoktok sub county as a result of the immigration of agriculturalist communities moving into the area after former group ranches were subdivided krugmann 1996 kikuyu and kamba people coming from other parts of kenya as well as chagga cultivators from tanzania were active in irrigation in kajiado county for the last three decades in lands adjacent to permanent water sources such as swamps and perennial springs campbell et al 2003 southgate and hulme 2000 the majority of these migrant farmers entered into informal arrangements of land leasing or sharecropping with local landowners krugmann 1996 in recent years smallholder irrigation started thriving in the drier parts of kajiado along the banks of the olkeriai the main sand river in the county the river is approximately 100 km long with a catchment covering an area of about 1500 km2 fig 1 the main administrative town is mashuru which is linked to the capital city nairobi through a recently tarmacked road satellite images of the olkeriai river available on google earth were analyzed to identify areas where irrigation activity was evident this information was used to draw spatial boundaries around a 50 km river stretch and 500 m from the river banks where fieldwork was implemented 2 2 interviews and data collection we used a combination of quantitative farm plots baseline survey and qualitative research in depth semi structured interviews methods to identify farming systems their characteristics and challenges faced by farmers the baseline survey was designed to collect a range of quantitative data at farm plot level such as plot sizes the origin of the farmer land ownership farming arrangements water abstraction technology irrigation method and crops grown during the baseline survey 214 farm plots purposefully stratified based on their location along the river upstream middle and downstream were visited some 121 plots were found to be operational at the time of visit while 93 were non operational interviews were carried out on 107 of the operational farm plots where respondents were available two farm management models were identified the tajiri farming system and the individual farming system table 1 following the findings of the baseline survey in depth interviews were conducted with a sample of 23 respondents selected from the baseline data based on the farm plot size geographical location and farm management system these interviews provided insights regarding previous farming experiences current farm practices and challenges three key stakeholders in the area were also interviewed to better understand the wider dynamics influencing irrigation development in the area the first was an agricultural officer who had been working in the area for over 10 years and had knowledge of the irrigation development in the area the second was a water engineer working for the county government of kajiado who had overseen the implementation of various water projects in the area the third was the director of the water resources authority which is the government body tasked with the regulation of water usage within the river basin 3 results 3 1 irrigation expansion along a sand river images of the upstream part of the olkeriai river obtained from google earth showed clusters of irregularly shaped green areas close to the river banks fig 2a denoting irrigated farm plots most of the farm plots were concentrated within a distance of 200 m from either side of the river banks key stakeholders noted that smallholder irrigation started in the mid 2000 s and had intensified over the last 10 years within this time farm plots establishment had spread from the upstream parts of the river to the mid and downstream parts a 2015 satellite image of the downstream part did not show farm plots similar to those observed in the upstream part however the same locations had operational farm plots which were visited during the baseline survey fig 2b 3 2 institutional arrangement of the tajiri farming system the baseline survey revealed that 80 out of 107 farm plots were managed under a partnership system between migrant farmers and capital providers supported by landowners and market brokers all having symbiotic interactions fig 3 this system known locally as the tajiri farming system was market oriented and involved intensive crop production under irrigation tajiri is the swahili word for a wealthy individual and in this study we use the term to describe the person providing the capital the tajiri and the farming system the tajiri farming system farmers who spent most of their time on the farm plots comprised the majority of the respondents interviewed table 2 the farm labor in a tajiri farming system was typically provided by small groups of two or three migrant farmers only in very few cases 4 were locals engaged in farm labor table 2 migrant farmers did not belong to the local maasai community but came from other traditional farming communities within and outside kenya in our sample 99 of farmers working in the tajiri farming system were men who had in migrated into the area to seek income from irrigated farming tajiris provided all the capital required in the farming venture including capital to dig water abstraction points along the river tajiris were mostly not available at the farm plot and only 7 were interviewed out of the 80 farm plots 28 of them were from the local masai community and 14 were women all landowners were local maasai people who owned land close to the river by virtue of being community members they leased out part of this land to the tajiris and migrant farmers and also gave rights to them to abstract water from the sand river market brokers gained knowledge of market dynamics from years of trading with buyers and sellers of specific crops they brought buyers from the city markets to the farm plots when the crops were ready for harvest 3 3 characteristics of the tajiri farming system 3 3 1 prevalence of land leasing and in migration the baseline survey reveals that out of 80 farm plots under the tajiri farming system 96 were leased table 3a the in depth interviews showed that 6 out of 11 leased farm plots were under formal written leases while 5 were under informal leases based on verbal agreements table 3b as seen in table 2 a majority of farmer and tajiris came from outside this area they were driven from their previous farming areas by resource related factors such as competition for water and shrinking farm plot sizes some returned to seek new partnerships with other migrant farmers and the tajiris 3 3 2 dependence on the sand river and portable irrigation technology all farm plots under the tajiri farming system needed investments in irrigation infrastructure table 3a water stored in the sand river aquifers was accessed either through scoop holes or shallow wells scoop holes were excavations in the sand river bed with a depth of one to five meters shallow wells were excavations located close to the river banks or further inland with depths varying between five and 15 m eight out of 12 farms used shallow wells as abstraction points while four farms relied on scoop holes the use of motorized pumps was the preferred technology for water abstraction with 80 of the farms using petrol pumps and the remaining 20 diesel pumps none of the farms used manual abstraction methods the motorized pumps complemented the most common irrigation method that was the pvc drag system used in 99 of the farm plots the pumps lifted water from the abstraction points to the highest points in the farm plot through pvc pipes that were used to transfer this water to furrows and basins and apply it to the crops more permanent irrigation technologies were rare drip irrigation which required on farm water storage structures such as elevated water tanks and well designed emitter networks was found in only 1 of the farm plots 3 3 3 market oriented irrigation densely populated urban towns and cities such as kajiado town machakos town and the city of nairobi surround the olkeriai river catchment area the high demand for farm products in these urban areas provided investment opportunities in irrigation in 11 out of 12 farm plots production was exclusively for the city markets by selling through brokers the tajiri farming system was highly specialized with tomatoes and watermelons being the two main crops grown in 86 of the farm plots the upgrading of the mashuru kajiado nairobi road to tarmac standard had also greatly influenced the movement of farm produce to the markets and opened up the area to more brokers and buyers from cities transportation of farm produce had become faster and less risky while farmers could access farm inputs in mashuru town instead of travelling to kajiado and nairobi 3 3 4 transient partnerships and mobility of actors the partnership agreements between migrant farmers and the tajiris were seasonal and rarely did the actors commit for the long term both were allowed to assess their options at the end of the seasons and decide whether to continue together or seek other people to work with many partnerships were therefore transient and the shifting from one partnership or one farm plot to another within or even out of the area was common this dynamism was evident from the survey responses which indicated that 65 of the respondents were only on their first season and 29 on their first or second year irrigating the current farm plot fig 4 these farm plots may have been previously farmed and vacated by other farmers or they could be newly established farm plots where the natural vegetation had been cleared 3 4 challenges and risks although the migrant farmers and the tajiris derived many benefits from these farming partnerships they also faced various challenges and risks disease and pest outbreaks were a major challenge resulting in the loss of all or a substantial part of crops farmers attributed this to the mono culture of two main crops to tackle the problem more capital was continuously required to buy farm inputs like pesticides and fertilizers marketing of farm produce was another challenge because it almost exclusively relied on brokers who had the upper hand in negotiating prices tajiris and farmers who opted to supply directly to the market were often sabotaged by the brokers and ended up incurring losses water shortage in some farms mainly in the upstream parts of the river was also observed this problem was common during dry periods when water levels in the sand river dropped and the wells could not provide sufficient yield those who faced this challenge resorted to increasing the depths of their wells digging additional abstraction points or getting into water sharing agreements with neighbouring farms whose wells had better yield despite these efforts some farmers could only irrigate a fraction of the land or risk crop damage due to lack of water destruction of crops by livestock was also common as many local maasai kept livestock that could break into the farm plots often leading to conflicts between farmers and herders farmers faced challenges in getting compensation for damages as there was no common arbitrator in such matters while the migrants preferred to seek redress through local administrative channels the local maasais maintained that such situations should be addressed by traditional elder councils a major risk associated with the tajiri farming system was disagreement between the tajiris and migrant farmers which often led to the termination of partnerships farmers who perceived a tajiri as unreliable in providing required farm inputs could opt to quit the partnership mid season and seek new partnerships with other tajiris or wait until the end of the season and leave immediately thereafter tajiris could also break up the partnerships if they did not fully trust the farmers expertise and doubt they will get profit from their capital investment 4 discussion farmer led irrigation has emerged and expanded in lands previously dominated by livestock keeping by the local maasai community irrigation is mostly carried out by people from outside the area through innovative farming partnerships comparable to the maasai traditional way of life this irrigation development is characterized by great mobility and flexibility enabled by the farming system structure the preferred way of water abstraction and irrigation technology irrigation development along the olkeriai sand river is driven by the availability of natural resources market demand for farm produce and a symbiotic mix of actors there is a connection between the current irrigation development in the area and the historical success of smallholder irrigation in other parts of kajiado specifically in loitoktok sub county the importance of immigrants to the development of farmer led irrigation was recognized by southgate and hulme 2000 and corresponds to what we observe in our case study where a majority of actors originate from outside the area several migrant farmers currently irrigating along the olkeriai river have also worked in the southern parts of kajiado where they left for better opportunities among the factors that drive farmers into the olkeriai river catchment is the lack of access to irrigation water in previous farming areas as early as the 1990s krugmann 1996 identified pressures on water resources in the high productive zones of kajiado leading to scarcity and rationing the discovery of sand river aquifers along the olkeriai has offered a new opportunity for irrigators the sand river is the lifeline of irrigation in the area and currently a narrow strip of land close to the riverbank has been transformed into a green farming belt farm plots have been established over a long stretch of the river course where access to water through shallow wells and scoop holes is possible the natural storage of water offered by the sand river benefits many people over a wide geographical area and allows decentralization of irrigation activities as noted by love et al 2011 moreover the investment needed for irrigation development along sand rivers is relatively modest because no water storage infrastructure is needed lack of access to farming capital has been identified by mendes and paglietti 2015 as a major hindrance to irrigation development by smallholder farmers in kenya resource endowment can therefore determine the ability of a farmer to engage in irrigation scoones et al 2019 identify a typology of farmers based on their resources technology used market linkages and knowledge access while tittonell et al 2010 additionally classify smallholder farms based on off farm incomes and production objectives in our case study we identify the tajiri farming system that allows access to water land capital for irrigation by low resource migrant farmers by establishing partnerships with tajiris the migrant farmers who do not have the required capital to start irrigating rely on their farming knowledge to negotiate temporary partnerships with a tajiri through which they can get into irrigated farming the tajiris may not have the farming knowledge but are willing to finance irrigation ventures aimed at producing high value market crops as a form of investment therefore farmers trade their expertise for capital and the tajiris invest capital expecting a profit from farmers expertise the emergence of the tajiri farming system and its current popularity along the olkeriai may stem from the successful culture of commercial farming in kajiado over the past four decades this led to the specialization of smallholder irrigation and the tajiri farming system that replicates a business strategy of capital investment and risk sharing all parties in the tajiri farming system assume some risk in this transient agreement farmers are not paid wages but receive 50 of profits at the end of the season which could be significantly higher but also lower than pre determined wages the tajiri bears all financial risks by investing the capital throughout the season without assured profits other actors also benefit from the dynamic tajiri farming system landowners adjacent to the river gain alternative sources of income through land leasing in addition to their livestock keeping market brokers provide a vital market linkage with city buyers and earn commissions a majority of farmers and their tajiris sell at the farm gate through brokers thus ensuring they do not face transportation risks the interdependencies seen in this case study affirm that smallholder farming activities do not happen in isolation but rely on interactions with local economies and external agencies as noted by woodhouse et al 2017 smallholder irrigation is encouraged in sub saharan africa as a way of ensuring food security and resilience of rural populations oecd fao 2016 this case study reveals an entrepreneurial mindset of farmers who have no financial capital to invest in irrigation but rely on investments from tajiris which they attract with their knowledge and farming experience two main factors enable the dynamic movement of farmers and their tajiris from one farm plot to another and from one part of the river to another first the flexible nature of agreements among actors agreements between tajiris and farmers are seasonally based and both parties have the liberty to terminate partnerships and establish new ones after each season second to irrigate most farmers use portable pumps and drag hoses that are easily moved from one farm plot to another this is different from farmer led collective irrigation systems in other parts of kajiado that depend on unlined canals for water acquisition southgate and hulme 2000 the tajiri farming system that drives irrigation development along the olkeriai river does not exhibit the design principles for enduring irrigation systems as defined by ostrom 1993 there is no collective decision making beyond the farm plot level and no clearly defined boundaries in terms of natural resource use or actors we identify several challenges related to this rapidly developing form of irrigation specialized crop farming leads to dependence on fertilizers and other agrochemicals and with time natural soil fertility reduces and crop pests and diseases become prevalent this not only reduces the productivity of the farm plots and consequent loss of potential income but also increases production costs locking out farmers with low resources similar to what de bont et al 2019 observed in tanzania s kahe region the tajiri farming system is focused on maximizing seasonal productivity with little attention given to long term resource sustainability the high number of non operational plots identified during the baseline survey is a result of the highly mobile farmers shifting from farm plots that have been cultivated for longer periods to virgin lands along other parts of the river this kind of nomadic irrigation development raises questions over which interventions will leverage its benefits while ensuring the sustainability of the resources supporting it de fraiture et al 2014 at the river catchment level many depend on the sand river including local pastoralists irrigators sand harvesters and domestic water users water and pasture have for long been valuable resources for maasai for human and livestock use rutten 2005 the use of shallow wells to access water for irrigation has now intensified as new actors emerge in the area which may imply a change in water management practices in the past these water resources were managed through communal laws enforced by elders and with conservation considered of great importance to the community borona 2020 with more control of these lands given to individuals after the subdivision of former group ranches it is no longer possible to enforce these traditional laws it remains to be seen how such institutions can accommodate for the changed relations cleaver 2002 notes that institutional bricolage emerges from a mixture of formal and informal networks norms and institutions similar to what has been observed in our case study with the tajiri farming system however in contrast to other areas where institutional bricolage has evolved to form working local institutions for common pool resource management de koning and cleaver 2012 our case study involves transient partnerships among highly mobile actors who do not have a long history of association 5 conclusions this study explores how farmer led irrigation is expanding in a dryland area of kenya driven by a dynamic and flexible farming arrangement that predominantly relies on sand river water resources in sand rivers and migration into the area by different actors the tajiri farming system enables actors to share the benefits and risks of irrigation it gives low resource endowed farmers the opportunity to participate in irrigation of high value market crops and investors from within and outside this area to invest in irrigation development the flexibility of the system allows each actor to choose the network and modality giving the most benefits our study shows that sand rivers are important nature based water storage areas that can not only support domestic uses but also upscale irrigated crop cultivation at relatively low investment costs it illustrates the emergence of decentralized and vibrant small scale irrigation thereby contrasting the long held view of irrigation being fixed in terms of infrastructure partnerships and norms the use of portable irrigation technology and flexible short term arrangements support the migratory nature and allow actors to carry out irrigation on the move we argue that this transient and profit driven irrigation development complicates collective action for natural resource management many of the actors driving irrigation are not socially embedded in the region and sustainable local institutional structures may take time to evolve we recommend further research to better understand the dynamics of the tajiri farming system and its implications for sustainable natural resource use first we propose to investigate the role of migration in the development of smallholder irrigation along sand rivers to understand the farmers and tajiris motives to move from one area to another and its implications for resource use secondly there is a need to investigate the emergence and establishment of tajiris as key players in the development of irrigation in the area finally we recommend studying the impact of current irrigation practices on the overall sand river resource use by taking into account all other users who depend on the sand river for their livelihoods funding this work was funded by the dutch research

river banks and the water abstracted by a variety of manual or pumping technologies hussey 2007 sand rivers thus have the potential to provide water for irrigation to small farms over a large geographical area along the river banks love et al 2011 farmer led irrigation in frontier areas is market oriented and usually attracts actors from outside these regions who view it as an investment opportunity de bont et al 2019 migrant farmers bring new water management techniques and adapt them to local contexts woodhouse et al 2017 these actors engage in partnerships across social networks on their own terms scoones et al 2019 decision making at the farm level regarding the choice of crops production processes and preferred markets tend to be individualistic and entrepreneurial nkoka et al 2014 woodhouse et al 2017 ostrom 1993 identified key principles to enable the management of common pool resources such as community led irrigation schemes and ensure enduring irrigation institutions these include among others clearly defined system boundaries and water user rights collective choice of operational rules sanctions for violating these rules and conflict resolution mechanisms these principles do not apply to the entrepreneurial farmer led irrigation along sand rivers in arid and semi arid areas where self organization and minimal reliance on external support are important characteristics however external shocks such as economic downturns affecting input and output prices may lead to income losses forcing farmers to discontinue irrigation duker et al 2020 specialization in high value market crops increases the demand for land and raises costs to enter into this lucrative kind of irrigation locking out farmers without sufficient capital de bont et al 2019 in this paper we illustrate with a case study from the olkeriai sand river in kenya how migrant farmers mitigate these entrepreneurial risks by engaging in partnerships with landowners and capital providers these include formal written as well as informal verbal agreements migrant farmers with experience in the cultivation of irrigated high value crops form small groups and seek a financier for their farming venture so called tajiris individuals with adequate resources and willingness to invest but lacking farming knowledge provide all capital for farming and digging water abstraction points tajiris and farmer group split the profits 50 50 at the end of the season thereby also sharing the farm risks local landowners lease out their land directly adjacent to the sand river thereby also giving the right to abstract water from the river section within their land s boundaries we describe the characteristics of this popular tajiri partnership along the olkeriai sand river and explore how its transient nature has advanced irrigation development in previously uncultivated pastoral drylands we seek to understand the formal and informal interdependencies among actors who build entrepreneurial farming partnerships to derive benefits from natural resources found along the sand river while sharing risks associated with smallholder irrigated agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and focus kajiado county is located on kenya s southern border with tanzania and most of its area lies in semi arid and arid agro climatic zones with a bimodal annual rainfall between 300 mm and 800 mm when the rainfall is concentrated bobadoye et al 2014 in the south of the county near the slopes of mt kilimanjaro some areas are classified as medium to high potential zones with an annual precipitation of up to 1250 mm mwangi 2016 the major river systems in the kajiado are the olkeriai river toroka river and the olkejuado river all seasonal rivers county government of kajiado 2018 the main inhabitants of kajiado are the maasai traditional pastoralists who have lived in the area for many generations keeping livestock as their main livelihood crop cultivation in kajiado county was introduced in high potential areas such as loitoktok sub county as a result of the immigration of agriculturalist communities moving into the area after former group ranches were subdivided krugmann 1996 kikuyu and kamba people coming from other parts of kenya as well as chagga cultivators from tanzania were active in irrigation in kajiado county for the last three decades in lands adjacent to permanent water sources such as swamps and perennial springs campbell et al 2003 southgate and hulme 2000 the majority of these migrant farmers entered into informal arrangements of land leasing or sharecropping with local landowners krugmann 1996 in recent years smallholder irrigation started thriving in the drier parts of kajiado along the banks of the olkeriai the main sand river in the county the river is approximately 100 km long with a catchment covering an area of about 1500 km2 fig 1 the main administrative town is mashuru which is linked to the capital city nairobi through a recently tarmacked road satellite images of the olkeriai river available on google earth were analyzed to identify areas where irrigation activity was evident this information was used to draw spatial boundaries around a 50 km river stretch and 500 m from the river banks where fieldwork was implemented 2 2 interviews and data collection we used a combination of quantitative farm plots baseline survey and qualitative research in depth semi structured interviews methods to identify farming systems their characteristics and challenges faced by farmers the baseline survey was designed to collect a range of quantitative data at farm plot level such as plot sizes the origin of the farmer land ownership farming arrangements water abstraction technology irrigation method and crops grown during the baseline survey 214 farm plots purposefully stratified based on their location along the river upstream middle and downstream were visited some 121 plots were found to be operational at the time of visit while 93 were non operational interviews were carried out on 107 of the operational farm plots where respondents were available two farm management models were identified the tajiri farming system and the individual farming system table 1 following the findings of the baseline survey in depth interviews were conducted with a sample of 23 respondents selected from the baseline data based on the farm plot size geographical location and farm management system these interviews provided insights regarding previous farming experiences current farm practices and challenges three key stakeholders in the area were also interviewed to better understand the wider dynamics influencing irrigation development in the area the first was an agricultural officer who had been working in the area for over 10 years and had knowledge of the irrigation development in the area the second was a water engineer working for the county government of kajiado who had overseen the implementation of various water projects in the area the third was the director of the water resources authority which is the government body tasked with the regulation of water usage within the river basin 3 results 3 1 irrigation expansion along a sand river images of the upstream part of the olkeriai river obtained from google earth showed clusters of irregularly shaped green areas close to the river banks fig 2a denoting irrigated farm plots most of the farm plots were concentrated within a distance of 200 m from either side of the river banks key stakeholders noted that smallholder irrigation started in the mid 2000 s and had intensified over the last 10 years within this time farm plots establishment had spread from the upstream parts of the river to the mid and downstream parts a 2015 satellite image of the downstream part did not show farm plots similar to those observed in the upstream part however the same locations had operational farm plots which were visited during the baseline survey fig 2b 3 2 institutional arrangement of the tajiri farming system the baseline survey revealed that 80 out of 107 farm plots were managed under a partnership system between migrant farmers and capital providers supported by landowners and market brokers all having symbiotic interactions fig 3 this system known locally as the tajiri farming system was market oriented and involved intensive crop production under irrigation tajiri is the swahili word for a wealthy individual and in this study we use the term to describe the person providing the capital the tajiri and the farming system the tajiri farming system farmers who spent most of their time on the farm plots comprised the majority of the respondents interviewed table 2 the farm labor in a tajiri farming system was typically provided by small groups of two or three migrant farmers only in very few cases 4 were locals engaged in farm labor table 2 migrant farmers did not belong to the local maasai community but came from other traditional farming communities within and outside kenya in our sample 99 of farmers working in the tajiri farming system were men who had in migrated into the area to seek income from irrigated farming tajiris provided all the capital required in the farming venture including capital to dig water abstraction points along the river tajiris were mostly not available at the farm plot and only 7 were interviewed out of the 80 farm plots 28 of them were from the local masai community and 14 were women all landowners were local maasai people who owned land close to the river by virtue of being community members they leased out part of this land to the tajiris and migrant farmers and also gave rights to them to abstract water from the sand river market brokers gained knowledge of market dynamics from years of trading with buyers and sellers of specific crops they brought buyers from the city markets to the farm plots when the crops were ready for harvest 3 3 characteristics of the tajiri farming system 3 3 1 prevalence of land leasing and in migration the baseline survey reveals that out of 80 farm plots under the tajiri farming system 96 were leased table 3a the in depth interviews showed that 6 out of 11 leased farm plots were under formal written leases while 5 were under informal leases based on verbal agreements table 3b as seen in table 2 a majority of farmer and tajiris came from outside this area they were driven from their previous farming areas by resource related factors such as competition for water and shrinking farm plot sizes some returned to seek new partnerships with other migrant farmers and the tajiris 3 3 2 dependence on the sand river and portable irrigation technology all farm plots under the tajiri farming system needed investments in irrigation infrastructure table 3a water stored in the sand river aquifers was accessed either through scoop holes or shallow wells scoop holes were excavations in the sand river bed with a depth of one to five meters shallow wells were excavations located close to the river banks or further inland with depths varying between five and 15 m eight out of 12 farms used shallow wells as abstraction points while four farms relied on scoop holes the use of motorized pumps was the preferred technology for water abstraction with 80 of the farms using petrol pumps and the remaining 20 diesel pumps none of the farms used manual abstraction methods the motorized pumps complemented the most common irrigation method that was the pvc drag system used in 99 of the farm plots the pumps lifted water from the abstraction points to the highest points in the farm plot through pvc pipes that were used to transfer this water to furrows and basins and apply it to the crops more permanent irrigation technologies were rare drip irrigation which required on farm water storage structures such as elevated water tanks and well designed emitter networks was found in only 1 of the farm plots 3 3 3 market oriented irrigation densely populated urban towns and cities such as kajiado town machakos town and the city of nairobi surround the olkeriai river catchment area the high demand for farm products in these urban areas provided investment opportunities in irrigation in 11 out of 12 farm plots production was exclusively for the city markets by selling through brokers the tajiri farming system was highly specialized with tomatoes and watermelons being the two main crops grown in 86 of the farm plots the upgrading of the mashuru kajiado nairobi road to tarmac standard had also greatly influenced the movement of farm produce to the markets and opened up the area to more brokers and buyers from cities transportation of farm produce had become faster and less risky while farmers could access farm inputs in mashuru town instead of travelling to kajiado and nairobi 3 3 4 transient partnerships and mobility of actors the partnership agreements between migrant farmers and the tajiris were seasonal and rarely did the actors commit for the long term both were allowed to assess their options at the end of the seasons and decide whether to continue together or seek other people to work with many partnerships were therefore transient and the shifting from one partnership or one farm plot to another within or even out of the area was common this dynamism was evident from the survey responses which indicated that 65 of the respondents were only on their first season and 29 on their first or second year irrigating the current farm plot fig 4 these farm plots may have been previously farmed and vacated by other farmers or they could be newly established farm plots where the natural vegetation had been cleared 3 4 challenges and risks although the migrant farmers and the tajiris derived many benefits from these farming partnerships they also faced various challenges and risks disease and pest outbreaks were a major challenge resulting in the loss of all or a substantial part of crops farmers attributed this to the mono culture of two main crops to tackle the problem more capital was continuously required to buy farm inputs like pesticides and fertilizers marketing of farm produce was another challenge because it almost exclusively relied on brokers who had the upper hand in negotiating prices tajiris and farmers who opted to supply directly to the market were often sabotaged by the brokers and ended up incurring losses water shortage in some farms mainly in the upstream parts of the river was also observed this problem was common during dry periods when water levels in the sand river dropped and the wells could not provide sufficient yield those who faced this challenge resorted to increasing the depths of their wells digging additional abstraction points or getting into water sharing agreements with neighbouring farms whose wells had better yield despite these efforts some farmers could only irrigate a fraction of the land or risk crop damage due to lack of water destruction of crops by livestock was also common as many local maasai kept livestock that could break into the farm plots often leading to conflicts between farmers and herders farmers faced challenges in getting compensation for damages as there was no common arbitrator in such matters while the migrants preferred to seek redress through local administrative channels the local maasais maintained that such situations should be addressed by traditional elder councils a major risk associated with the tajiri farming system was disagreement between the tajiris and migrant farmers which often led to the termination of partnerships farmers who perceived a tajiri as unreliable in providing required farm inputs could opt to quit the partnership mid season and seek new partnerships with other tajiris or wait until the end of the season and leave immediately thereafter tajiris could also break up the partnerships if they did not fully trust the farmers expertise and doubt they will get profit from their capital investment 4 discussion farmer led irrigation has emerged and expanded in lands previously dominated by livestock keeping by the local maasai community irrigation is mostly carried out by people from outside the area through innovative farming partnerships comparable to the maasai traditional way of life this irrigation development is characterized by great mobility and flexibility enabled by the farming system structure the preferred way of water abstraction and irrigation technology irrigation development along the olkeriai sand river is driven by the availability of natural resources market demand for farm produce and a symbiotic mix of actors there is a connection between the current irrigation development in the area and the historical success of smallholder irrigation in other parts of kajiado specifically in loitoktok sub county the importance of immigrants to the development of farmer led irrigation was recognized by southgate and hulme 2000 and corresponds to what we observe in our case study where a majority of actors originate from outside the area several migrant farmers currently irrigating along the olkeriai river have also worked in the southern parts of kajiado where they left for better opportunities among the factors that drive farmers into the olkeriai river catchment is the lack of access to irrigation water in previous farming areas as early as the 1990s krugmann 1996 identified pressures on water resources in the high productive zones of kajiado leading to scarcity and rationing the discovery of sand river aquifers along the olkeriai has offered a new opportunity for irrigators the sand river is the lifeline of irrigation in the area and currently a narrow strip of land close to the riverbank has been transformed into a green farming belt farm plots have been established over a long stretch of the river course where access to water through shallow wells and scoop holes is possible the natural storage of water offered by the sand river benefits many people over a wide geographical area and allows decentralization of irrigation activities as noted by love et al 2011 moreover the investment needed for irrigation development along sand rivers is relatively modest because no water storage infrastructure is needed lack of access to farming capital has been identified by mendes and paglietti 2015 as a major hindrance to irrigation development by smallholder farmers in kenya resource endowment can therefore determine the ability of a farmer to engage in irrigation scoones et al 2019 identify a typology of farmers based on their resources technology used market linkages and knowledge access while tittonell et al 2010 additionally classify smallholder farms based on off farm incomes and production objectives in our case study we identify the tajiri farming system that allows access to water land capital for irrigation by low resource migrant farmers by establishing partnerships with tajiris the migrant farmers who do not have the required capital to start irrigating rely on their farming knowledge to negotiate temporary partnerships with a tajiri through which they can get into irrigated farming the tajiris may not have the farming knowledge but are willing to finance irrigation ventures aimed at producing high value market crops as a form of investment therefore farmers trade their expertise for capital and the tajiris invest capital expecting a profit from farmers expertise the emergence of the tajiri farming system and its current popularity along the olkeriai may stem from the successful culture of commercial farming in kajiado over the past four decades this led to the specialization of smallholder irrigation and the tajiri farming system that replicates a business strategy of capital investment and risk sharing all parties in the tajiri farming system assume some risk in this transient agreement farmers are not paid wages but receive 50 of profits at the end of the season which could be significantly higher but also lower than pre determined wages the tajiri bears all financial risks by investing the capital throughout the season without assured profits other actors also benefit from the dynamic tajiri farming system landowners adjacent to the river gain alternative sources of income through land leasing in addition to their livestock keeping market brokers provide a vital market linkage with city buyers and earn commissions a majority of farmers and their tajiris sell at the farm gate through brokers thus ensuring they do not face transportation risks the interdependencies seen in this case study affirm that smallholder farming activities do not happen in isolation but rely on interactions with local economies and external agencies as noted by woodhouse et al 2017 smallholder irrigation is encouraged in sub saharan africa as a way of ensuring food security and resilience of rural populations oecd fao 2016 this case study reveals an entrepreneurial mindset of farmers who have no financial capital to invest in irrigation but rely on investments from tajiris which they attract with their knowledge and farming experience two main factors enable the dynamic movement of farmers and their tajiris from one farm plot to another and from one part of the river to another first the flexible nature of agreements among actors agreements between tajiris and farmers are seasonally based and both parties have the liberty to terminate partnerships and establish new ones after each season second to irrigate most farmers use portable pumps and drag hoses that are easily moved from one farm plot to another this is different from farmer led collective irrigation systems in other parts of kajiado that depend on unlined canals for water acquisition southgate and hulme 2000 the tajiri farming system that drives irrigation development along the olkeriai river does not exhibit the design principles for enduring irrigation systems as defined by ostrom 1993 there is no collective decision making beyond the farm plot level and no clearly defined boundaries in terms of natural resource use or actors we identify several challenges related to this rapidly developing form of irrigation specialized crop farming leads to dependence on fertilizers and other agrochemicals and with time natural soil fertility reduces and crop pests and diseases become prevalent this not only reduces the productivity of the farm plots and consequent loss of potential income but also increases production costs locking out farmers with low resources similar to what de bont et al 2019 observed in tanzania s kahe region the tajiri farming system is focused on maximizing seasonal productivity with little attention given to long term resource sustainability the high number of non operational plots identified during the baseline survey is a result of the highly mobile farmers shifting from farm plots that have been cultivated for longer periods to virgin lands along other parts of the river this kind of nomadic irrigation development raises questions over which interventions will leverage its benefits while ensuring the sustainability of the resources supporting it de fraiture et al 2014 at the river catchment level many depend on the sand river including local pastoralists irrigators sand harvesters and domestic water users water and pasture have for long been valuable resources for maasai for human and livestock use rutten 2005 the use of shallow wells to access water for irrigation has now intensified as new actors emerge in the area which may imply a change in water management practices in the past these water resources were managed through communal laws enforced by elders and with conservation considered of great importance to the community borona 2020 with more control of these lands given to individuals after the subdivision of former group ranches it is no longer possible to enforce these traditional laws it remains to be seen how such institutions can accommodate for the changed relations cleaver 2002 notes that institutional bricolage emerges from a mixture of formal and informal networks norms and institutions similar to what has been observed in our case study with the tajiri farming system however in contrast to other areas where institutional bricolage has evolved to form working local institutions for common pool resource management de koning and cleaver 2012 our case study involves transient partnerships among highly mobile actors who do not have a long history of association 5 conclusions this study explores how farmer led irrigation is expanding in a dryland area of kenya driven by a dynamic and flexible farming arrangement that predominantly relies on sand river water resources in sand rivers and migration into the area by different actors the tajiri farming system enables actors to share the benefits and risks of irrigation it gives low resource endowed farmers the opportunity to participate in irrigation of high value market crops and investors from within and outside this area to invest in irrigation development the flexibility of the system allows each actor to choose the network and modality giving the most benefits our study shows that sand rivers are important nature based water storage areas that can not only support domestic uses but also upscale irrigated crop cultivation at relatively low investment costs it illustrates the emergence of decentralized and vibrant small scale irrigation thereby contrasting the long held view of irrigation being fixed in terms of infrastructure partnerships and norms the use of portable irrigation technology and flexible short term arrangements support the migratory nature and allow actors to carry out irrigation on the move we argue that this transient and profit driven irrigation development complicates collective action for natural resource management many of the actors driving irrigation are not socially embedded in the region and sustainable local institutional structures may take time to evolve we recommend further research to better understand the dynamics of the tajiri farming system and its implications for sustainable natural resource use first we propose to investigate the role of migration in the development of smallholder irrigation along sand rivers to understand the farmers and tajiris motives to move from one area to another and its implications for resource use secondly there is a need to investigate the emergence and establishment of tajiris as key players in the development of irrigation in the area finally we recommend studying the impact of current irrigation practices on the overall sand river resource use by taking into account all other users who depend on the sand river for their livelihoods funding this work was funded by the dutch research

9592,the chinese loess plateau clp is prone to adverse effects from drought especially the widespread creation of a dried soil layer dsl a problem intensified by revegetation under the grain for green program using 13 year soil moisture sm data we compared soil water consumption by planted shrubs korshinsk peashrub kop planted grass purple alfalfa alf and natural grass nag from 2004 to 2016 in the clp to assess the soil water recovery processes long term 30 years sm dynamics were simulated using the simultaneous heat and water shaw model based on field data and local meteorological data under two scenarios a converting kop to nag and b converting alf to nag the results showed that the decline rates of sm in 1 4 m profiles for nag 24 0 29 8 were much lower than those for kop 47 6 51 4 and alf 48 8 50 2 during the 13 year growth period modelling sm dynamics at depths of 1 4 m for 30 years showed that sm gradually increased and that the dsl prevalence could be reduced under scenarios a and b the complete elimination of dsl requires at least 6 years at 1 4 m under scenario a 13 years at 2 4 m and 22 years at 1 2 m under scenario b soil water restored to local stable soil water levels requires approximately 19 13 and 15 years in the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m profiles respectively under scenario a soil water recovery will take approximately 28 years in the 2 3 m profile and 27 years in the 3 4 m profile under scenario b our results enhance the understanding of the soil water depletion and recovery processes under different vegetation types and can could be used to provide scientific guidance for sustainable ecological restoration in the clp keywords soil water recovery soil water depletion dry soil layer revegetation loess plateau 1 introduction the chinese loess plateau clp has a fragile ecosystem as a result of severe soil erosion water shortage widespread degradation of soil and vegetation and intensive human disturbance wang et al 2015 fu et al 2016 since 1950 a series of vegetation restoration measures have been implemented to control soil erosion and restore the ecological environment for example the grain for green program was initiated to reconvert cropland to artificial forests shrubs and grass in the clp song et al 2014 as a result vegetation cover in the clp increased by more than 25 0 from 1999 to 2013 and this area has become one of the most prominent ecological restoration zones in china chen et al 2015 fu et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 however the current vegetation cover exceeds the climate defined equilibrium state zhang et al 2018a and net primary productivity approaches the threshold defined by water resource sustainability in the region feng et al 2016 moreover vegetation restoration has accelerated soil water depletion and aggravated water scarcity gradually causing the formation of dry soil layer dsl in the clp wang et al 2011 2017 widespread artificial revegetation in the clp has caused the extensive formation and distribution of dsl which generally occur below the annual mean rainfall infiltration depth in the soil profile zhang et al 2015 jia et al 2019 ge et al 2020 dsl can exert adverse effects such as restricting plant growth increasing the risk of plant mortality intensifying soil degradation negatively affecting hydrological processes and influencing regional atmospheric circulation jian et al 2015 shao et al 2018 once dsl reach a certain thickness over an extensive area it is difficult to restore the sm to the original soil conditions zhang et al 2018b therefore ecological success through revegetation is negatively affected by dsl jia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 given its adverse impacts on revegetation water resources and ecosystem services dsl in the clp are a major ecological problem and a research focus in soil physics ecohydrology and agronomy shao et al 2018 together these findings suggest that it is urgent to ascertain whether sm in dsl can be compensated quickly enough to allow soil water recovery in the clp soil desiccation is alleviated to some extent by extreme rainfall which leads to the recharge of subsurface sm via infiltration or by changes in land use from artificial forests grassland to natural grassland cropland wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a precipitation during extremely wet years has a short term effect on the replenishment of sm in land under peashrubs and alfalfa but it does not eliminate dsl liu and shao 2016 soil water restored to the local stable soil water level requires approximately 20 years after converting alfalfa to cropland in the clp sun et al 2009 liu et al 2008 these studies showed that the dsl caused by the continuous growth of water intensive consuming vegetation could be eliminated gradually after revegetating to cropland even though it would take a long time previous studies have focused on water recovery when land under alfalfa is converted to crops however water loss and soil erosion occur easily in croplands the possibility and time for dsl elimination and sm recovery after converting peashrubs and alfalfa to natural grass remain uncertain although sm recovery in dsl in the clp has received considerable attention previous studies have either been temporal based on field experiments over several years or spatial extending over a wide area sun et al 2009 liu et al 2008 investigations into the dynamic processes of sm recovery in dsl require expensive and time consuming field experiments mathematical models have the advantage of evaluating sm dynamics over the long term based on historical records of climatic conditions the physically based simultaneous heat and water shaw model has been found to be an efficient tool for simulating sm dynamics and water balance for various land uses in the plateau of china huang and gallichand 2006 fu et al 2012 li et al 2012 liu and shao 2015 currently few studies have modelled the processes of sm recovery in dsl after converting peashrubs and alfalfa to natural grass over a long time period thus in this study the shaw model was used to simulate one dimensional sm dynamics and analyse the processes of sm recovery in dsl the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of peashrubs alfalfa and natural grass on sm dynamics in 1 4 m soil profiles from 2004 to 2016 2 to evaluate sm dynamics and the elimination of dsl after converting peashrubs and alfalfa to natural grass and 3 to determine the time required for soil water recovery to the stable soil water level in a 1 4 m profile these issues are critical in the context of returning large areas of farmland to grassland or forests in the clp 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area and plots the study was conducted at the shenmu erosion and environmental experimental station 38 49n 110 23e located in the liudaogou catchment in the northern clp the mean annual temperature is 8 4 c ranging from 9 7 c in january to 23 7 c in july and the average annual precipitation is 437 mm precipitation has significant seasonal and inter annual variations and approximately 80 0 of rainfall occurs from may to september liu and shao 2015 most of the original vegetation has been destroyed because of soil erosion and long term human activities to restore the vegetation various non native shrubs and herbaceous species such as korshinsk peashrub caragana korshinskii kom and purple alfalfa medicago sativa l have been extensively planted over the past few decades three vegetation types were chosen for this study korshinsk peashrub kop purple alfalfa alf and natural native grass nag because they are the plants generally used for vegetation restoration in the experimental catchment field plots were established on a uniform 12 14 hill slope with a length of 60 m and a width of 5 m in 2003 fig 1 prior to 2003 the field plots were croplands in 2004 1 year old peashrubs were transplanted at a planting spacing of 70 cm 70 cm seeds of alfalfa were sowed with a row spacing of 50 cm and nag was developed from abandoned cropland the peashrubs were left to grow naturally without human disturbance while the alfalfa plants were harvested twice every year in late july and late october cut near the soil surface the natural native grass developed without human disturbance after the arable land was abandoned in 2004 and the predominant species were stipa bungeana lespedeza davurica artemisia capillaries leymus secalinus poa sphondylodes and stipa bungeana the growing periods of peashrub alfalfa and natural grass were all between march and october none of the plots were irrigated and precipitation was the only source of soil water recharge 2 2 data measurement and collection in 2004 11 aluminium neutron probes 4 m in length were installed along the centre of each plot at intervals of 5 m sm was measured monthly during the growing seasons april to october from july 2004 to october 2010 and biweekly from april 2011 to october 2016 using a cnc503dr hydro probe beijing super power company beijing china sm was not regularly observed in the non growing season because it lacked variability jia et al 2019 the measured depths were 4 m with increments of 0 1 m from 0 to 1 m and 0 2 m in the 1 4 m soil layers the sm values are the average sm values of the 11 profiles in each plot for each time point data on the vegetation characteristics plant height aboveground biomass and leaf area index were collected monthly during the growing season the plant heights were measured using a steel tape the leaf area index lai in 2010 2015 was calculated from photographs using imagej software national institutes of health usa aboveground biomass was measured by destructively sampling 10 representative branches and three quadrats of 1 m 1 m for peashrubs and alfalfa respectively vegetation samples were oven dried at 75 c for 72 h and then weighed the biomass and lai of peashrubs and alfalfa for 2004 2005 and 2008 2009 were taken from a previous study in the experimental plots zeng 2006 fu 2010 the biomass and lai of peashrubs and alfalfa in 2006 2007 were collected by the same growth age plant in other stands in the study area meteorological data from 1987 to 2009 were collected from the yulin meteorological station id chm00053646 while meteorological data for 2010 2016 were collected from the meteorological station in the study area the meteorological data included daily precipitation daily mean wind speed daily solar radiation daily mean dew point temperature and daily maximum and minimum air temperatures these data were used as input variables to model the sm dynamics 2 3 simulation method 2 3 1 model description the shaw model can simulate one dimensional water and heat movement within a vertical profile flerchinger 2000

layers 0 2 m increments were used from 0 to 4 m depth with pore size distribution parameters air entry pressure saturated hydraulic conductivity soil bulk density saturated water content and soil textures the plant growth parameters for the shaw model including height dry aboveground biomass lai and effective rooting depth and these were based on field measurements and previous studies zeng 2006 fu 2010 the water flux at the lower boundary was considered to be free drainage and soil temperature was estimated using this model the model was driven by daily meteorological data including maximum and minimum air temperatures dew point temperature wind speed precipitation and solar radiation daily weather conditions constituted the upper boundary meteorological conditions and were used to drive the model the initial values of the soil and plant parameters for the shaw model have been described in liu and shao 2015 2 3 3 model optimisation and evaluation a dried soil layer is a soil desiccation phenomenon that forms below the mean annual infiltration depth and can be induced by excessive soil water depletion by exotic perennial plants chen et al 2008 shao et al 2018 fu et al 2012 and liu and shao 2016 reported that the depth of rainfall infiltration was generally within 1 0 m in land planted with peashrubs and alfalfa on the clp the upper 1 0 m of soil tends to be replenished by rainfall infiltration wang et al 2010a 2010b therefore a depth of 1 0 m was regarded as the upper boundary of the dsl in this study the measured and simulated sm values below 1 0 m were analyzed to study the formation and recovery of dsl thus soil texture and the soil hydraulic parameters for the shaw model were optimised in the 1 4 m profiles table 1 to improve the simulation s accuracy the soil and plant parameters for the shaw model were calibrated using 480 measured sm data at 1 4 m depths from july 2004 to october 2008 and the model was validated using 352 measured sm data at 1 4 m depths from may 2009 to october 2013 for each plot the simulated performance of the shaw model was evaluated using statistical analyses the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse mean error me and root mean squared error rmse were used to evaluate model performance the indices were calculated as follows 5 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 6 me 1 n i 1 n p i o i 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 2 4 design of the simulation scenarios based on the changes in land use patterns in the experimental plots and the successional trends of local vegetation types in the study area two scenarios were defined a converting kop to nag and b converting alf to nag the artificial vegetation restoration period was 2004 2016 with two vegetation types kop and alf the natural grass stage for 2017 2046 was completely removed from the planted shrubs and grass and converted to natural grass sm dynamics and the formation development and recovery of the dsl under land use change were investigated the initial sm values used for the simulation were taken from the measured data at july 2016 as shown in fig 3 2 5 quantifying the recovery of soil water researchers consider sm in the dsl to have a range between the permanent wilting point lower limit and the stable field capacity sfc upper limit wang et al 2010a 2010b jia et al 2019 the sfc is generally considered to be approximately 50 0 70 0 of the field capacity usually 60 0 however 50 0 for sandy soil and 70 0 for clay soil based on the soil textures in the northern loess plateau and a layer with an sm lower than the sfc would be considered a dsl yang and tian 2004 in general the sfc is assumed to be the sm at 60 0 of the field capacity and is simplified as a fixed value in the vertical soil profile dong et al 2017 shao et al 2018 in this study the sfc was 12 0 which is equal to 60 0 of the field capacity to quantify and compare the degree of elimination of dsl in different years an index of soil water recovery in the dsl swri was calculated as follows 8 swri smf smi sfc smi where sfc is the stable field capacity smf is the soil moisture at the end of a period and smi is the soil moisture at the beginning of a period dsl elimination was divided into six grades based on the swri fang et al 2010 sun et al 2009 i complete elimination if swri 1 ii great elimination if 0 75 swri 1 iii fine elimination if 0 5 swri 0 75 iv medium elimination if 0 25 swri 0 5 v slight elimination if 0 swri 0 25 vi no elimination if sdi 0 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the hydraulic parameters of the shaw model were calibrated using sm data at 1 4 m depths from july 2004 to october 2008 and were validated using date from may 2009 to october 2013 the simulated and corresponding observed sm values for different soil layers in the 1 4 m profiles were plotted using linear regression in fig 2 in general the simulated and measured sm values in the 1 4 m profiles matched well for both sites with r2 coefficient of determination of 0 862 and 0 916 for calibration in kop and alf respectively the r2 values were 0 849 and 0 794 for validation in kop and alf respectively model performance was also examined by comparing the simulated and measured sm values as presented in table 2 the nse values were 0 746 and 0 833 for calibration and 0 760 and 0 721 for validation in kop and alf respectively the me and rmse values were 0 002 and 0 013 for kop and 0 001 and 0 010 for alf respectively during the validation period the me and rmse were 0 001 and 0 006 for kop and 0 002 and 0 008 for alf respectively the results indicate that the shaw model performed well and that it can accurately predict the daily dynamics of sm in different layers of the 1 4 m profiles in the kop and alf 3 2 soil water consumption under different vegetation types the sm dynamics based on consecutive in situ sm measurements in the kop alf and nag from 2004 to 2016 are shown in figs 3 and 4 the vegetation planted in the kop and alf and grown for 13 years caused more available sm to be depleted in the 1 4 m profiles than in natural grass with depth averaged sm values of 0 101 cm3 cm 3 for kop 0 102 cm3 cm 3 for alf and 0 147 cm3 cm 3 for nag in july 2016 fig 3 compared with the initial sm in july 2004 the volumetric sm in the kop alf and nag decreased by 10 1 10 0 and 5 5 respectively in the 1 4 m profiles in july 2016 fig 3 in the kop the depth averaged sm values increased with soil depth but were similar in the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers in the alf and nag soil desiccation occurred in 2006 in both the kop and alf and the dsl were deeper than 4 m after 2010 in the kop and after 2008 in the alf fig 4 no dsl formed in the 1 4 m profiles in the nag from 2004 to 2016 although the depth averaged sm values in the 1 2 m were temporarily less than 0 120 cm3 cm 3 in 2011 2012 and 2015 there were three stages for sm changes in the kop and alf and two stages in the nag from 2004 to 2016 fig 4 in the kop and alf the first stage was a period of rapid decline where the depth averaged sm decreased rapidly from 2004 to 2008 the sm ranged from 0 076 to 0 125 cm3 cm 3 in the kop and 0 081 0 098 cm3 cm 3 in the alf in the 1 4 m profiles in july 2008 during this stage soil water storage sws in the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers decreased by 59 8 49 8 and 37 4 in the kop and 59 7 56 9 and 49 8 in the alf respectively table 3 during the stage of slow decline the second stage sm decreased slowly from 2009 to 2011 and sws decreased by 2 1 12 3 and 21 5 in the kop and 0 3 4 4 and 13 9 in the alf respectively during the relative stability stage the third stage sm values were considerably lower and temporally less variable from 2012 to 2016 mainly changing with precipitation in the 1 2 m layer in the nag the sm was consumed by the growth of natural grass from 2004 to 2011 and sm values in 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers were relatively stable and varied with precipitation from 2012 to 2016 the stable sws levels in the nag were 138 5 mm at 1 2 m 138 0 mm at 2 3 m and 148 3 mm at 3 4 m respectively which were calculated using the mean values from 2012 to 2016 3 3 soil water status after converting peashrubs to natural grass after calibration and validation the shaw model simulated sm dynamics at depths of 1 4 m under scenario a converting peashrubs to natural grass over a 30 year period the simulated sm values at depths of 1 4 m for 30 years showed a gradual increase after the conversion of planted shrubs to natural grass in general although the sm varied with differences in annual precipitation fig 5 over the 30 year period there was an increase in the depth averaged sm values of 57 2 at 1 2 m 101 7 at 2 3 m and 108 5 at 3 4 m table 4 shows the degree of recovery of the dsl in the various soil layers the time to completely eliminate the dsl varied for the different layers with 4 years at 1 2 m 5 years at 2 3 m and 6 years at 3 4 m after these periods the swri values changed as follows 1 05 2 46 at 1 2 m 1 13 2 81 at 1 2 m and 1 05 3 33 at 1 2 m respectively the sws values decreased with increasing depth between 1 and 7 years and increased with depth from 16 to 30 years in the 1 4 m profiles while the sws values in the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m profiles were similar during the 8 15 years fig 7a the dsl was gradually eliminated with sws at 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m depths greater than 120 mm upper limit of sws for dsl in the 5 year 5 year and 6 year periods respectively during the 6 30 year period the sws values at 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m depths were always greater than 120 mm thus at least 6 years are required to eliminated dsl at 1 4 m after converting peashrubs to natural grass soil water could be restored to the level of the multi year mean sws of the nag 138 5 mm in 1 2 m 138 0 mm in 2 3 m and 148 3 mm in 3 4 m in the 1 4 m profile the swss ranged from 138 8 to 180 6 mm in 1 2 m depth after 18 years 141 2 181 6 mm in 2 3 m depth after 12 years and 148 2 188 4 mm in 3 4 m depth after 14 years 3 4 soil water status after converting alfalfa to natural grass fig 6 shows the spatial temporal dynamics of simulated sm at depths of 1 4 m after converting alfalfa to natural grass scenario b over a 30 year period the sm gradually increased in the 1 4 m profile before 13 years and then sm was relatively stable and fluctuated with rainfall in the 2 4 m depth sm in the 1 2 m depth was mostly lower than 0 120 cm3 cm 3 throughout the 30 years except in wet years the depth averaged sm increased by 28 9 at 1 2 m 55 7 at 2 3 m and 78 2 at 3 4 m at the end of the 30 years the swri values in various soil layers showed that the dsl could be eliminated within 22 years at 1 2 m 13 years at 2 3 m and 13 years at 3 4 m table 4 the swri values were lower than 1 0 between 24 and 27 years in the 1 2 m and between 16 and 17 years in the 2 3 m mainly because of low annual precipitation in these years the swss in the 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers gradually increased with little effect from inter annual variations in precipitation fig 7b sws values in the 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers were both lower than 120 mm within 1 12 years and larger than 120 mm after 13 years sws in the 1 2 m layer began to exceed 120 mm in 22 years but was greatly affected by inter annual precipitation changes resulting in renewed soil desiccation in dry years sws values in the 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers were similar and ranged from 93 42 to 129 39 mm and from 90 49 to 128 63 mm within 1 15 years respectively after 15 years the sws values in the 1 4 m profile increased with increasing depth 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m dsl at depths of 2 3 m and 3 4 m was eliminated after 13 years soil water could recover to the multi year mean sws in the nag within 28 30 years in the 2 3 m layer and within 27 30 years in 3 4 m layers the sws values in the 1 2 m layer were lower than 133 0 mm during the 30 year period 4 discussion 4 1 soil water sustainability in natural grass land in this study the conversion of cropland to kop or alf caused a significant decline in sm and soil desiccation at depths of 1 4 m while no dsl formed during 2004 2016 in the nag during the 2004 2016 monitoring period sm at 1 4 m soil depths under kop alf and nag decreased by 47 6 51 4 48 8 50 2 and 24 0 29 8 respectively the kop alf and nag were located on land with the same slope and similar soil texture topography initial sm and microclimatic conditions therefore our results implied that the planted shrubs and grass intensified sm decline especially in deep soil compared with natural grass yang et al 2012 observed a 35 0 decrease in deep sm due to the conversion of cropland to shrubland causing an apparent sm deficit natural grass with shallow roots and lower water consumption can maintain more sm in semi arid and arid areas huang et al 2013 2020 our results support those of previous studies where planted grass and shrubs with deep roots and higher evapotranspiration rates would consume more sm as well as aggravate water deficiency and soil desiccation jian et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a natural grass is conducive to the sustainability of grassland restoration in drought prone environments huang et al 2019 in recent years sm in croplands has also shown a significant decline in our study area liu and shao 2015 jia et al 2017 mainly attributed to a decline in annual precipitation the annual precipitation in 2005 2006 and 2010 2011 was consistently lower than the mean value from 2004 to 2016 liu and shao 2016 sm at 0 4 m depth in cropland decreased in the range of 20 7 27 4 during the period from 2004 to 2014 jia et al 2017 in the nag the decline rate of sm values from 2004 to 2014 24 0 29 8 was similar to that in cropland 20 7 27 4 and was much lower than that in kop 47 6 51 4 and alf 48 8 50 2 respectively non native vegetation is better than native vegetation in reducing soil erosion over short time periods whereas natural grass rehabilitation is better for preventing soil erosion over longer periods zhang et al 2019 this suggests that the water consumption of natural grass is similar to that of crops and that natural grass is beneficial for both water and soil conservation compared with planted shrubs and grasses in the clp natural grass which has low water consumption requirements may be more suitable for revegetation purposes because it achieves both soil conservation and adequate hydrological sustainability of the soil in the clp wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b furthermore the conversion of planted shrubs to natural grass helps to conserve soil and water as well as maintaining a balance between soil water supply and soil water consumption by vegetation jia et al 2020 thus natural grasslands facilitate vegetation sustainability and are suitable for ecological restoration in water limited areas 4 2 recovery of soil water after converting planted shrubs and grass to natural grass clp is prone to problems caused by drought especially the widespread formation of dsl in deep soil profiles dried soil layers threaten the health and sustainability of restored ecosystems in this region jia et al 2020 thus there is an urgent need to study the recovery of soil water to eliminate dsl and maintain sustainable soil water development previous studies have shown that removing intense water consuming vegetation from local crops gradually restores soil water liu et al 2008 sun et al 2009 changing land use such as rotating alfalfa crops and natural grass could effectively restore sm consumed by growing alfalfa she 2009 natural grasslands can maintain more sm thus two scenarios for converting planted shrubs and grass to natural grass were designed to restore soil water in this study the results showed that it took approximately 6 years for the dsl at depths of 1 4 m to be entirely eliminated under scenario a under scenario b the dsl at 2 4 m could be eliminated after 13 years while soil desiccation at 1 2 m was not completely eliminated within 30 years the results were consistent with the study by bai et al 2020 which showed that sm in dsl could recover over time due to changes in land use our findings also demonstrated that converting planted shrubs and grasses with deep roots and high water consumption to natural grass can achieve soil water recovery in dsl in arid and semi arid areas the target level for soil water recovery after converting planted vegetation to natural grass is the local stable soil water level the local stable soil water level was considered to be the multi year average value in the 1 4 m profiles in the nag in this study thus the recovery time was defined as the time when the soil water increased to the local stable soil water in the 1 4 m profiles under scenario a the soil water recovery times were approximately 19 13 and 15 years for the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers respectively where peashrubs had grown for 13 years to natural grassland under scenario b soil water recovery took approximately 28 years in the 2 3 m layer and 27 years in the 3 4 m layer soil water did not recover to the target level in the 1 2 m layer under scenario b during the 30 year period in general the simulated sm dynamics can be divided into three stages after the conversion of the planted shrub and grass to natural grass within 30 years figs 5 7 in the first stage sm increased but was still below 0 120 cm3 cm 3 sfc and belonged to the dsl in the 1 4 m profile in the second stage sm recovered from the upper soil water limit of the dsl to the target level for soil water recovery in the 1 4 m profiles in the third stage sm mainly fluctuated due to rainfall during the natural grass growing period where soil water was relatively stable at depths of 2 4 m natural grass has a lower biomass and a shallower root system than exotic grass and shrubs allowing more water infiltration and less water consumption the sm values therefore gradually increased and the dsl could be restored after the shrubs and grasses were replaced with natural grass 5 conclusion this study evaluated the sm dynamics and the processes of soil water consumption under three revegetation types based on in situ measurements of sm at 0 4 m depths from 2004 to 2016 in the northern clp revegetation with peashrubs and alfalfa intensified soil water loss in 1 4 m profiles resulting in the formation of dsl natural grass is a suitable vegetation type for ecological restoration maintaining more soil water than exotic species and facilitating vegetation and soil water sustainability the long term 2016 2046 dynamics of sm in 1 4 m profiles were simulated using the optimised shaw model to assess the effects of land use change scenario a converting peashrubs to natural grass scenario b converting alfalfa to natural grass on dsl variations and the processes of soil water recovery simulation results showed that the dsl in 1 4 m profiles caused by excessive water consumption by planted peashrubs and alfalfa could be completely eliminated which requires at least 6 years under scenario a and 13 years in 2 4 m profile and 22 years in 1 2 m profile under scenario b however soil water restored to local stable soil water levels will take 13 19 years in 1 4 m profile under scenario a and longer than 28 years under scenario b the findings from the long term sm dynamics in response to land use change highlight the possibility of dsl remediation through land use management therefore considering the negative effects of peashrubs and alfalfa on deep soil water conditions further revegetation projects should aim to increase the area of natural grass or convert the areas under exotic shrubs and grasses which have caused dsl formation to natural grass in the water limited area of the northern clp declaration of

9592,the chinese loess plateau clp is prone to adverse effects from drought especially the widespread creation of a dried soil layer dsl a problem intensified by revegetation under the grain for green program using 13 year soil moisture sm data we compared soil water consumption by planted shrubs korshinsk peashrub kop planted grass purple alfalfa alf and natural grass nag from 2004 to 2016 in the clp to assess the soil water recovery processes long term 30 years sm dynamics were simulated using the simultaneous heat and water shaw model based on field data and local meteorological data under two scenarios a converting kop to nag and b converting alf to nag the results showed that the decline rates of sm in 1 4 m profiles for nag 24 0 29 8 were much lower than those for kop 47 6 51 4 and alf 48 8 50 2 during the 13 year growth period modelling sm dynamics at depths of 1 4 m for 30 years showed that sm gradually increased and that the dsl prevalence could be reduced under scenarios a and b the complete elimination of dsl requires at least 6 years at 1 4 m under scenario a 13 years at 2 4 m and 22 years at 1 2 m under scenario b soil water restored to local stable soil water levels requires approximately 19 13 and 15 years in the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m profiles respectively under scenario a soil water recovery will take approximately 28 years in the 2 3 m profile and 27 years in the 3 4 m profile under scenario b our results enhance the understanding of the soil water depletion and recovery processes under different vegetation types and can could be used to provide scientific guidance for sustainable ecological restoration in the clp keywords soil water recovery soil water depletion dry soil layer revegetation loess plateau 1 introduction the chinese loess plateau clp has a fragile ecosystem as a result of severe soil erosion water shortage widespread degradation of soil and vegetation and intensive human disturbance wang et al 2015 fu et al 2016 since 1950 a series of vegetation restoration measures have been implemented to control soil erosion and restore the ecological environment for example the grain for green program was initiated to reconvert cropland to artificial forests shrubs and grass in the clp song et al 2014 as a result vegetation cover in the clp increased by more than 25 0 from 1999 to 2013 and this area has become one of the most prominent ecological restoration zones in china chen et al 2015 fu et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 however the current vegetation cover exceeds the climate defined equilibrium state zhang et al 2018a and net primary productivity approaches the threshold defined by water resource sustainability in the region feng et al 2016 moreover vegetation restoration has accelerated soil water depletion and aggravated water scarcity gradually causing the formation of dry soil layer dsl in the clp wang et al 2011 2017 widespread artificial revegetation in the clp has caused the extensive formation and distribution of dsl which generally occur below the annual mean rainfall infiltration depth in the soil profile zhang et al 2015 jia et al 2019 ge et al 2020 dsl can exert adverse effects such as restricting plant growth increasing the risk of plant mortality intensifying soil degradation negatively affecting hydrological processes and influencing regional atmospheric circulation jian et al 2015 shao et al 2018 once dsl reach a certain thickness over an extensive area it is difficult to restore the sm to the original soil conditions zhang et al 2018b therefore ecological success through revegetation is negatively affected by dsl jia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 given its adverse impacts on revegetation water resources and ecosystem services dsl in the clp are a major ecological problem and a research focus in soil physics ecohydrology and agronomy shao et al 2018 together these findings suggest that it is urgent to ascertain whether sm in dsl can be compensated quickly enough to allow soil water recovery in the clp soil desiccation is alleviated to some extent by extreme rainfall which leads to the recharge of subsurface sm via infiltration or by changes in land use from artificial forests grassland to natural grassland cropland wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a precipitation during extremely wet years has a short term effect on the replenishment of sm in land under peashrubs and alfalfa but it does not eliminate dsl liu and shao 2016 soil water restored to the local stable soil water level requires approximately 20 years after converting alfalfa to cropland in the clp sun et al 2009 liu et al 2008 these studies showed that the dsl caused by the continuous growth of water intensive consuming vegetation could be eliminated gradually after revegetating to cropland even though it would take a long time previous studies have focused on water recovery when land under alfalfa is converted to crops however water loss and soil erosion occur easily in croplands the possibility and time for dsl elimination and sm recovery after converting peashrubs and alfalfa to natural grass remain uncertain although sm recovery in dsl in the clp has received considerable attention previous studies have either been temporal based on field experiments over several years or spatial extending over a wide area sun et al 2009 liu et al 2008 investigations into the dynamic processes of sm recovery in dsl require expensive and time consuming field experiments mathematical models have the advantage of evaluating sm dynamics over the long term based on historical records of climatic conditions the physically based simultaneous heat and water shaw model has been found to be an efficient tool for simulating sm dynamics and water balance for various land uses in the plateau of china huang and gallichand 2006 fu et al 2012 li et al 2012 liu and shao 2015 currently few studies have modelled the processes of sm recovery in dsl after converting peashrubs and alfalfa to natural grass over a long time period thus in this study the shaw model was used to simulate one dimensional sm dynamics and analyse the processes of sm recovery in dsl the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of peashrubs alfalfa and natural grass on sm dynamics in 1 4 m soil profiles from 2004 to 2016 2 to evaluate sm dynamics and the elimination of dsl after converting peashrubs and alfalfa to natural grass and 3 to determine the time required for soil water recovery to the stable soil water level in a 1 4 m profile these issues are critical in the context of returning large areas of farmland to grassland or forests in the clp 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area and plots the study was conducted at the shenmu erosion and environmental experimental station 38 49n 110 23e located in the liudaogou catchment in the northern clp the mean annual temperature is 8 4 c ranging from 9 7 c in january to 23 7 c in july and the average annual precipitation is 437 mm precipitation has significant seasonal and inter annual variations and approximately 80 0 of rainfall occurs from may to september liu and shao 2015 most of the original vegetation has been destroyed because of soil erosion and long term human activities to restore the vegetation various non native shrubs and herbaceous species such as korshinsk peashrub caragana korshinskii kom and purple alfalfa medicago sativa l have been extensively planted over the past few decades three vegetation types were chosen for this study korshinsk peashrub kop purple alfalfa alf and natural native grass nag because they are the plants generally used for vegetation restoration in the experimental catchment field plots were established on a uniform 12 14 hill slope with a length of 60 m and a width of 5 m in 2003 fig 1 prior to 2003 the field plots were croplands in 2004 1 year old peashrubs were transplanted at a planting spacing of 70 cm 70 cm seeds of alfalfa were sowed with a row spacing of 50 cm and nag was developed from abandoned cropland the peashrubs were left to grow naturally without human disturbance while the alfalfa plants were harvested twice every year in late july and late october cut near the soil surface the natural native grass developed without human disturbance after the arable land was abandoned in 2004 and the predominant species were stipa bungeana lespedeza davurica artemisia capillaries leymus secalinus poa sphondylodes and stipa bungeana the growing periods of peashrub alfalfa and natural grass were all between march and october none of the plots were irrigated and precipitation was the only source of soil water recharge 2 2 data measurement and collection in 2004 11 aluminium neutron probes 4 m in length were installed along the centre of each plot at intervals of 5 m sm was measured monthly during the growing seasons april to october from july 2004 to october 2010 and biweekly from april 2011 to october 2016 using a cnc503dr hydro probe beijing super power company beijing china sm was not regularly observed in the non growing season because it lacked variability jia et al 2019 the measured depths were 4 m with increments of 0 1 m from 0 to 1 m and 0 2 m in the 1 4 m soil layers the sm values are the average sm values of the 11 profiles in each plot for each time point data on the vegetation characteristics plant height aboveground biomass and leaf area index were collected monthly during the growing season the plant heights were measured using a steel tape the leaf area index lai in 2010 2015 was calculated from photographs using imagej software national institutes of health usa aboveground biomass was measured by destructively sampling 10 representative branches and three quadrats of 1 m 1 m for peashrubs and alfalfa respectively vegetation samples were oven dried at 75 c for 72 h and then weighed the biomass and lai of peashrubs and alfalfa for 2004 2005 and 2008 2009 were taken from a previous study in the experimental plots zeng 2006 fu 2010 the biomass and lai of peashrubs and alfalfa in 2006 2007 were collected by the same growth age plant in other stands in the study area meteorological data from 1987 to 2009 were collected from the yulin meteorological station id chm00053646 while meteorological data for 2010 2016 were collected from the meteorological station in the study area the meteorological data included daily precipitation daily mean wind speed daily solar radiation daily mean dew point temperature and daily maximum and minimum air temperatures these data were used as input variables to model the sm dynamics 2 3 simulation method 2 3 1 model description the shaw model can simulate one dimensional water and heat movement within a vertical profile flerchinger 2000 the shaw model consists of a one dimensional vertical system extending from the vegetation canopy to a specified soil depth and can include snow and plant residues daily or hourly weather conditions such as air temperature wind speed humidity solar radiation and precipitation above the upper boundary and soil conditions at the lower boundary were used to define the heat and water fluxes in the model the soil water flux equation with provisions for freezing and thawing soil is 1 θ l t ρ i ρ l θ i t z k φ z 1 1 ρ l q v z u in this equation θ l is the volumetric liquid water content m3 m 3 θ i is the volumetric ice content m3 m 3 ρ i is the bulk density of water g cm 3 ρ l is the bulk density of ice g cm 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 ψ is the soil matric potential m

campbell 1974 2 φ φ e θ l θ s b where ψ e is the air entry potential m b is the pore size distribution parameter and θ s is the saturated water content m3 m 3 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is computed as follow 3 k k s θ l θ s 2 b 3 where ks is saturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 within plants water flow is controlled mainly by changes in stomatal resistances campbell 1985 4 r s r so 1 φ l φ c n where rso is the stomatal resistance m s 1 with no water stress φ c is the critical leaf water potential m at which the stomatal resistance is twice its minimum value φ l is the leaf water potential and n is an empirical coefficient therefore five crop parameters rso φ c n rr and rl need to be optimised for calculating transpiration 2 3 2 model setup the soil profile was divided into 20 layers 0 2 m increments were used from 0 to 4 m depth with pore size distribution parameters air entry pressure saturated hydraulic conductivity soil bulk density saturated water content and soil textures the plant growth parameters for the shaw model including height dry aboveground biomass lai and effective rooting depth and these were based on field measurements and previous studies zeng 2006 fu 2010 the water flux at the lower boundary was considered to be free drainage and soil temperature was estimated using this model the model was driven by daily meteorological data including maximum and minimum air temperatures dew point temperature wind speed precipitation and solar radiation daily weather conditions constituted the upper boundary meteorological conditions and were used to drive the model the initial values of the soil and plant parameters for the shaw model have been described in liu and shao 2015 2 3 3 model optimisation and evaluation a dried soil layer is a soil desiccation phenomenon that forms below the mean annual infiltration depth and can be induced by excessive soil water depletion by exotic perennial plants chen et al 2008 shao et al 2018 fu et al 2012 and liu and shao 2016 reported that the depth of rainfall infiltration was generally within 1 0 m in land planted with peashrubs and alfalfa on the clp the upper 1 0 m of soil tends to be replenished by rainfall infiltration wang et al 2010a 2010b therefore a depth of 1 0 m was regarded as the upper boundary of the dsl in this study the measured and simulated sm values below 1 0 m were analyzed to study the formation and recovery of dsl thus soil texture and the soil hydraulic parameters for the shaw model were optimised in the 1 4 m profiles table 1 to improve the simulation s accuracy the soil and plant parameters for the shaw model were calibrated using 480 measured sm data at 1 4 m depths from july 2004 to october 2008 and the model was validated using 352 measured sm data at 1 4 m depths from may 2009 to october 2013 for each plot the simulated performance of the shaw model was evaluated using statistical analyses the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse mean error me and root mean squared error rmse were used to evaluate model performance the indices were calculated as follows 5 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 6 me 1 n i 1 n p i o i 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 2 4 design of the simulation scenarios based on the changes in land use patterns in the experimental plots and the successional trends of local vegetation types in the study area two scenarios were defined a converting kop to nag and b converting alf to nag the artificial vegetation restoration period was 2004 2016 with two vegetation types kop and alf the natural grass stage for 2017 2046 was completely removed from the planted shrubs and grass and converted to natural grass sm dynamics and the formation development and recovery of the dsl under land use change were investigated the initial sm values used for the simulation were taken from the measured data at july 2016 as shown in fig 3 2 5 quantifying the recovery of soil water researchers consider sm in the dsl to have a range between the permanent wilting point lower limit and the stable field capacity sfc upper limit wang et al 2010a 2010b jia et al 2019 the sfc is generally considered to be approximately 50 0 70 0 of the field capacity usually 60 0 however 50 0 for sandy soil and 70 0 for clay soil based on the soil textures in the northern loess plateau and a layer with an sm lower than the sfc would be considered a dsl yang and tian 2004 in general the sfc is assumed to be the sm at 60 0 of the field capacity and is simplified as a fixed value in the vertical soil profile dong et al 2017 shao et al 2018 in this study the sfc was 12 0 which is equal to 60 0 of the field capacity to quantify and compare the degree of elimination of dsl in different years an index of soil water recovery in the dsl swri was calculated as follows 8 swri smf smi sfc smi where sfc is the stable field capacity smf is the soil moisture at the end of a period and smi is the soil moisture at the beginning of a period dsl elimination was divided into six grades based on the swri fang et al 2010 sun et al 2009 i complete elimination if swri 1 ii great elimination if 0 75 swri 1 iii fine elimination if 0 5 swri 0 75 iv medium elimination if 0 25 swri 0 5 v slight elimination if 0 swri 0 25 vi no elimination if sdi 0 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the hydraulic parameters of the shaw model were calibrated using sm data at 1 4 m depths from july 2004 to october 2008 and were validated using date from may 2009 to october 2013 the simulated and corresponding observed sm values for different soil layers in the 1 4 m profiles were plotted using linear regression in fig 2 in general the simulated and measured sm values in the 1 4 m profiles matched well for both sites with r2 coefficient of determination of 0 862 and 0 916 for calibration in kop and alf respectively the r2 values were 0 849 and 0 794 for validation in kop and alf respectively model performance was also examined by comparing the simulated and measured sm values as presented in table 2 the nse values were 0 746 and 0 833 for calibration and 0 760 and 0 721 for validation in kop and alf respectively the me and rmse values were 0 002 and 0 013 for kop and 0 001 and 0 010 for alf respectively during the validation period the me and rmse were 0 001 and 0 006 for kop and 0 002 and 0 008 for alf respectively the results indicate that the shaw model performed well and that it can accurately predict the daily dynamics of sm in different layers of the 1 4 m profiles in the kop and alf 3 2 soil water consumption under different vegetation types the sm dynamics based on consecutive in situ sm measurements in the kop alf and nag from 2004 to 2016 are shown in figs 3 and 4 the vegetation planted in the kop and alf and grown for 13 years caused more available sm to be depleted in the 1 4 m profiles than in natural grass with depth averaged sm values of 0 101 cm3 cm 3 for kop 0 102 cm3 cm 3 for alf and 0 147 cm3 cm 3 for nag in july 2016 fig 3 compared with the initial sm in july 2004 the volumetric sm in the kop alf and nag decreased by 10 1 10 0 and 5 5 respectively in the 1 4 m profiles in july 2016 fig 3 in the kop the depth averaged sm values increased with soil depth but were similar in the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers in the alf and nag soil desiccation occurred in 2006 in both the kop and alf and the dsl were deeper than 4 m after 2010 in the kop and after 2008 in the alf fig 4 no dsl formed in the 1 4 m profiles in the nag from 2004 to 2016 although the depth averaged sm values in the 1 2 m were temporarily less than 0 120 cm3 cm 3 in 2011 2012 and 2015 there were three stages for sm changes in the kop and alf and two stages in the nag from 2004 to 2016 fig 4 in the kop and alf the first stage was a period of rapid decline where the depth averaged sm decreased rapidly from 2004 to 2008 the sm ranged from 0 076 to 0 125 cm3 cm 3 in the kop and 0 081 0 098 cm3 cm 3 in the alf in the 1 4 m profiles in july 2008 during this stage soil water storage sws in the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers decreased by 59 8 49 8 and 37 4 in the kop and 59 7 56 9 and 49 8 in the alf respectively table 3 during the stage of slow decline the second stage sm decreased slowly from 2009 to 2011 and sws decreased by 2 1 12 3 and 21 5 in the kop and 0 3 4 4 and 13 9 in the alf respectively during the relative stability stage the third stage sm values were considerably lower and temporally less variable from 2012 to 2016 mainly changing with precipitation in the 1 2 m layer in the nag the sm was consumed by the growth of natural grass from 2004 to 2011 and sm values in 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers were relatively stable and varied with precipitation from 2012 to 2016 the stable sws levels in the nag were 138 5 mm at 1 2 m 138 0 mm at 2 3 m and 148 3 mm at 3 4 m respectively which were calculated using the mean values from 2012 to 2016 3 3 soil water status after converting peashrubs to natural grass after calibration and validation the shaw model simulated sm dynamics at depths of 1 4 m under scenario a converting peashrubs to natural grass over a 30 year period the simulated sm values at depths of 1 4 m for 30 years showed a gradual increase after the conversion of planted shrubs to natural grass in general although the sm varied with differences in annual precipitation fig 5 over the 30 year period there was an increase in the depth averaged sm values of 57 2 at 1 2 m 101 7 at 2 3 m and 108 5 at 3 4 m table 4 shows the degree of recovery of the dsl in the various soil layers the time to completely eliminate the dsl varied for the different layers with 4 years at 1 2 m 5 years at 2 3 m and 6 years at 3 4 m after these periods the swri values changed as follows 1 05 2 46 at 1 2 m 1 13 2 81 at 1 2 m and 1 05 3 33 at 1 2 m respectively the sws values decreased with increasing depth between 1 and 7 years and increased with depth from 16 to 30 years in the 1 4 m profiles while the sws values in the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m profiles were similar during the 8 15 years fig 7a the dsl was gradually eliminated with sws at 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m depths greater than 120 mm upper limit of sws for dsl in the 5 year 5 year and 6 year periods respectively during the 6 30 year period the sws values at 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m depths were always greater than 120 mm thus at least 6 years are required to eliminated dsl at 1 4 m after converting peashrubs to natural grass soil water could be restored to the level of the multi year mean sws of the nag 138 5 mm in 1 2 m 138 0 mm in 2 3 m and 148 3 mm in 3 4 m in the 1 4 m profile the swss ranged from 138 8 to 180 6 mm in 1 2 m depth after 18 years 141 2 181 6 mm in 2 3 m depth after 12 years and 148 2 188 4 mm in 3 4 m depth after 14 years 3 4 soil water status after converting alfalfa to natural grass fig 6 shows the spatial temporal dynamics of simulated sm at depths of 1 4 m after converting alfalfa to natural grass scenario b over a 30 year period the sm gradually increased in the 1 4 m profile before 13 years and then sm was relatively stable and fluctuated with rainfall in the 2 4 m depth sm in the 1 2 m depth was mostly lower than 0 120 cm3 cm 3 throughout the 30 years except in wet years the depth averaged sm increased by 28 9 at 1 2 m 55 7 at 2 3 m and 78 2 at 3 4 m at the end of the 30 years the swri values in various soil layers showed that the dsl could be eliminated within 22 years at 1 2 m 13 years at 2 3 m and 13 years at 3 4 m table 4 the swri values were lower than 1 0 between 24 and 27 years in the 1 2 m and between 16 and 17 years in the 2 3 m mainly because of low annual precipitation in these years the swss in the 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers gradually increased with little effect from inter annual variations in precipitation fig 7b sws values in the 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers were both lower than 120 mm within 1 12 years and larger than 120 mm after 13 years sws in the 1 2 m layer began to exceed 120 mm in 22 years but was greatly affected by inter annual precipitation changes resulting in renewed soil desiccation in dry years sws values in the 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers were similar and ranged from 93 42 to 129 39 mm and from 90 49 to 128 63 mm within 1 15 years respectively after 15 years the sws values in the 1 4 m profile increased with increasing depth 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m dsl at depths of 2 3 m and 3 4 m was eliminated after 13 years soil water could recover to the multi year mean sws in the nag within 28 30 years in the 2 3 m layer and within 27 30 years in 3 4 m layers the sws values in the 1 2 m layer were lower than 133 0 mm during the 30 year period 4 discussion 4 1 soil water sustainability in natural grass land in this study the conversion of cropland to kop or alf caused a significant decline in sm and soil desiccation at depths of 1 4 m while no dsl formed during 2004 2016 in the nag during the 2004 2016 monitoring period sm at 1 4 m soil depths under kop alf and nag decreased by 47 6 51 4 48 8 50 2 and 24 0 29 8 respectively the kop alf and nag were located on land with the same slope and similar soil texture topography initial sm and microclimatic conditions therefore our results implied that the planted shrubs and grass intensified sm decline especially in deep soil compared with natural grass yang et al 2012 observed a 35 0 decrease in deep sm due to the conversion of cropland to shrubland causing an apparent sm deficit natural grass with shallow roots and lower water consumption can maintain more sm in semi arid and arid areas huang et al 2013 2020 our results support those of previous studies where planted grass and shrubs with deep roots and higher evapotranspiration rates would consume more sm as well as aggravate water deficiency and soil desiccation jian et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a natural grass is conducive to the sustainability of grassland restoration in drought prone environments huang et al 2019 in recent years sm in croplands has also shown a significant decline in our study area liu and shao 2015 jia et al 2017 mainly attributed to a decline in annual precipitation the annual precipitation in 2005 2006 and 2010 2011 was consistently lower than the mean value from 2004 to 2016 liu and shao 2016 sm at 0 4 m depth in cropland decreased in the range of 20 7 27 4 during the period from 2004 to 2014 jia et al 2017 in the nag the decline rate of sm values from 2004 to 2014 24 0 29 8 was similar to that in cropland 20 7 27 4 and was much lower than that in kop 47 6 51 4 and alf 48 8 50 2 respectively non native vegetation is better than native vegetation in reducing soil erosion over short time periods whereas natural grass rehabilitation is better for preventing soil erosion over longer periods zhang et al 2019 this suggests that the water consumption of natural grass is similar to that of crops and that natural grass is beneficial for both water and soil conservation compared with planted shrubs and grasses in the clp natural grass which has low water consumption requirements may be more suitable for revegetation purposes because it achieves both soil conservation and adequate hydrological sustainability of the soil in the clp wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b furthermore the conversion of planted shrubs to natural grass helps to conserve soil and water as well as maintaining a balance between soil water supply and soil water consumption by vegetation jia et al 2020 thus natural grasslands facilitate vegetation sustainability and are suitable for ecological restoration in water limited areas 4 2 recovery of soil water after converting planted shrubs and grass to natural grass clp is prone to problems caused by drought especially the widespread formation of dsl in deep soil profiles dried soil layers threaten the health and sustainability of restored ecosystems in this region jia et al 2020 thus there is an urgent need to study the recovery of soil water to eliminate dsl and maintain sustainable soil water development previous studies have shown that removing intense water consuming vegetation from local crops gradually restores soil water liu et al 2008 sun et al 2009 changing land use such as rotating alfalfa crops and natural grass could effectively restore sm consumed by growing alfalfa she 2009 natural grasslands can maintain more sm thus two scenarios for converting planted shrubs and grass to natural grass were designed to restore soil water in this study the results showed that it took approximately 6 years for the dsl at depths of 1 4 m to be entirely eliminated under scenario a under scenario b the dsl at 2 4 m could be eliminated after 13 years while soil desiccation at 1 2 m was not completely eliminated within 30 years the results were consistent with the study by bai et al 2020 which showed that sm in dsl could recover over time due to changes in land use our findings also demonstrated that converting planted shrubs and grasses with deep roots and high water consumption to natural grass can achieve soil water recovery in dsl in arid and semi arid areas the target level for soil water recovery after converting planted vegetation to natural grass is the local stable soil water level the local stable soil water level was considered to be the multi year average value in the 1 4 m profiles in the nag in this study thus the recovery time was defined as the time when the soil water increased to the local stable soil water in the 1 4 m profiles under scenario a the soil water recovery times were approximately 19 13 and 15 years for the 1 2 m 2 3 m and 3 4 m layers respectively where peashrubs had grown for 13 years to natural grassland under scenario b soil water recovery took approximately 28 years in the 2 3 m layer and 27 years in the 3 4 m layer soil water did not recover to the target level in the 1 2 m layer under scenario b during the 30 year period in general the simulated sm dynamics can be divided into three stages after the conversion of the planted shrub and grass to natural grass within 30 years figs 5 7 in the first stage sm increased but was still below 0 120 cm3 cm 3 sfc and belonged to the dsl in the 1 4 m profile in the second stage sm recovered from the upper soil water limit of the dsl to the target level for soil water recovery in the 1 4 m profiles in the third stage sm mainly fluctuated due to rainfall during the natural grass growing period where soil water was relatively stable at depths of 2 4 m natural grass has a lower biomass and a shallower root system than exotic grass and shrubs allowing more water infiltration and less water consumption the sm values therefore gradually increased and the dsl could be restored after the shrubs and grasses were replaced with natural grass 5 conclusion this study evaluated the sm dynamics and the processes of soil water consumption under three revegetation types based on in situ measurements of sm at 0 4 m depths from 2004 to 2016 in the northern clp revegetation with peashrubs and alfalfa intensified soil water loss in 1 4 m profiles resulting in the formation of dsl natural grass is a suitable vegetation type for ecological restoration maintaining more soil water than exotic species and facilitating vegetation and soil water sustainability the long term 2016 2046 dynamics of sm in 1 4 m profiles were simulated using the optimised shaw model to assess the effects of land use change scenario a converting peashrubs to natural grass scenario b converting alfalfa to natural grass on dsl variations and the processes of soil water recovery simulation results showed that the dsl in 1 4 m profiles caused by excessive water consumption by planted peashrubs and alfalfa could be completely eliminated which requires at least 6 years under scenario a and 13 years in 2 4 m profile and 22 years in 1 2 m profile under scenario b however soil water restored to local stable soil water levels will take 13 19 years in 1 4 m profile under scenario a and longer than 28 years under scenario b the findings from the long term sm dynamics in response to land use change highlight the possibility of dsl remediation through land use management therefore considering the negative effects of peashrubs and alfalfa on deep soil water conditions further revegetation projects should aim to increase the area of natural grass or convert the areas under exotic shrubs and grasses which have caused dsl formation to natural grass in the water limited area of the northern clp declaration of

9593,precipitation has been recognized as the dominant factor driving crop grain yields and large yield variations in drylands which suggests that some agricultural management practices can be optimized to achieve high yields and benefits in this study we investigated 804 farmers wheat fields from 2015 to 2018 in the dryland area of the loess plateau in china and analyzed the relationships between wheat yield and the influence factors including precipitation wheat sowing rate fertilizer inputs and soil nutrients to propose optimized agricultural management practices for wheat production the results showed that wheat grain yield followed a linear plateau pattern relative to the precipitation in the summer fallow season with a yield of 5344 kg ha 1 obtained at a precipitation of 203 mm in the l203 group precipitation in the summer fallow season less than 203 mm the low yield subgroup 0 33th in grain yield group in order from low to high had a lower sowing rate kernel weight kernel number and spike number than the high yield subgroup 68 100th in grain yield group different levels of phosphorous p and potassium k fertilizer overuse were found among the three yield subgroups however in the h203 group precipitation in the summer fallow season greater than 203 mm differences in only kernel and spike numbers and nitrogen n fertilizer application rate were observed among the low moderate and high yield subgroups additionally there were no differences in the soil organic matter som total n or ph in the three subgroups in either l203 or h203 but significant differences in soil mineral n available p and k were observed among the three subgroups except mineral n in l203 based on these results the wheat sowing rate and fertilizer input rates can be optimized to increase wheat yield and farmers income and promote agricultural management for dryland wheat production on the loess plateau keywords rainfall yield variation nutrient management wheat production dryland 1 introduction wheat covers 220 million hectares of agricultural lands worldwide fao 2021 of which 66 are drylands khasheisiuki et al 2011 and provides 766 million tons of grain in 2019 fao 2021 since the global food demand will increase by 35 56 between 2010 and 2050 van dijk et al 2021 due to rapid urbanization and population increases crop yield increases are an inevitable challenge especially in drylands where there has large variations in wheat yield with 0 61 2 75 t ha 1 in eastern australia feng et al 2018 0 6 8 t ha 1 in eastern washington schillinger et al 2008 0 75 8 25 t ha 1 in northwestern china cao et al 2017 and 0 5 5 t ha 1 in central argentina rolla et al 2018 these variations are due to agronomic practices and climate anderson 2010 lollato et al 2019 mueller et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2010 which can provide potential opportunities for understanding factors constraining wheat yield increases in drylands precipitation has been recognized as the dominant factor affecting grain yields and large yield variations annual precipitation varied from 200 to 700 mm in the last 50 years in western australia ludwig et al 2009 and this factor explained approximately 40 of the total wheat yield variation ray et al 2015 on the north china plain up to 20 of the yield variation was caused by weather factors including precipitation and temperature zhang et al 2013 yield variation exists not only under different precipitation conditions but also under similar precipitation conditions it was found that wheat yield ranged from 50 to 1000 kg ha 1 when the precipitation was approximately 200 mm in the growing season in iran khasheisiuki et al 2011 from 1000 to 3500 kg ha 1 when the precipitation was approximately 300 mm in the growing season in western australia anderson 2010 and from 2000 to 6100 kg ha 1 when the annual precipitation was approximately 550 mm in northwestern china cao et al 2017 these results indicate that in addition to precipitation there may be other factors driving yield variations therefore it is very important to understand the links between precipitation and management practices for increasing the crop yield under similar precipitation conditions optimized fertilizer nutrient inputs seeding rates and cultivation practices have been proven to be the key ways to increase crop yields in drylands anderson 2010 carignano et al 2008 gastaldi et al 2020 hochman and horan 2018 lollato et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 2013 globally due to fertilizer strategy optimization nitrogen n fertilizer use decreased by 28 11 million tons and phosphate fertilizer use decreased by 38 5 million tons while cereal crop production increased by approximately 30 from 1997 to 2003 mueller et al 2012 moreover a reasonable increase in n fertilizer from 76 to 90 kg n ha 1 in coordination with the improvement of other agronomic practices increased wheat yield from 2348 to 4809 kg ha 1 in uruguay mazzilli et al 2016 and an increase in n fertilizer application in addition to new seeding equipment increased wheat yields nationally by 30 in australia hochman and horan 2018 in china millions of chinese smallholder farmers adopted enhanced management practices for cereal maize rice and wheat production from 2005 to 2015 the results showed that average yields increased by 10 8 11 5 application of nitrogen fertilizer decreased by 14 7 18 1 and greenhouse gas ghg emissions decreased by 13 7 22 3 cui et al 2018 these results suggest that the combination of nutrients management and other agronomical measures was of potential significance in increasing crop yield while decreasing fertilizer input and therefore decreasing the negative environmental effects e g ghg emissions n residues in soil etc of overused chemical fertilizers previous work showed that the precipitation in the fallow season after wheat harvest and before the next wheat sown was significantly correlated with winter wheat yield and could be used to predict the crop yield and its nutrient requirements in the coming season cao et al 2017 however it could not predict the yield variation in different fields and did not supply measure to increase yields based on soil fertility fertilizer management strategies and seeding and cultivation practices therefore based on an in situ farm survey in the central loess plateau of china the aim of the present study was to 1 investigate wheat yield variation under different precipitation in the fallow season 2 understand the factors controlling the yield variation and 3 propose an optimized management strategy for soil nutrients fertilization and sowing for high wheat yield to farmers in drylands of china and other similar areas of the world 2 material and methods 2 1 in situ farm investigation an in situ farm survey was carried out in 804 farmers fields during the four consecutive years from 2015 to 2018 in the central loess plateau of china with 305 in 2015 270 in 2016 108 in 2017 and 121 in 2018 table 1 these sampling sites were in 11 counties where winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the dominant grain crop and covers approximately 2 52 million hectares of farmland with an annual air temperature of 6 6 14 0 c and annual precipitation of 203 700 mm approximately 60 of the precipitation in this region occurs during the summer fallow season from july to september the average monthly precipitation at the experimental sites is presented in fig 1 rain fed winter wheat is sown in late september or early october and harvested in early to late june in the next year the period from june to september after wheat harvest and before the next wheat sown is the fallow season soils in these areas are developed from loess parent material and classiﬁed as calcareous eum orthic anthrosol fao selected soil properties in the sampling area are presented in table 1 at wheat harvest early june to late june plant and soil samples were collected from the corresponding fields

ﬁeld chen et al 2014 he et al 2018 anova was performed in sas v8 0 sas institute inc usa for statistical analysis and a least significant difference test at p 0 05 was used to assess the mean differences sigmaplot v12 5 systat software inc usa was used for regression analysis 3 results 3 1 precipitation in the summer fallow season and its relationship with wheat grain yield across the sampling area the precipitation ranged from 95 to 475 mm in the summer fallow season and 118 332 mm in the wheat growing season regression analysis showed that wheat grain yield followed a linear plateau model with precipitation in the summer fallow season p 0 001 fig 2a with a plateau yield of 5344 kg ha 1 obtained at a precipitation of 203 mm however no significant relation was found between the yield and precipitation in the growing season fig 2b based on the linear plateau model with the turning point of 203 mm the precipitation observations were categorized into two groups according to the precipitation in the summer fallow season l203 and h203 with summer fallow precipitation lower and higher than 203 mm respectively then depending on the yield differences each group was further divided into three yield subgroups low moderate and high by separating the samples into equal groups based on their yield ordered from low to high seasonal precipitation analysis showed that significant differences were observed among the low moderate and high yield groups in the l203 group but no significant differences were found in the h203 group fig 3 the precipitation of the summer fallow season in low moderate and high yield subgroups accounted for 32 3 35 4 and 41 1 respectively of the total annual precipitation in the l203 group and 61 1 60 8 and 60 0 respectively of the total annual precipitation in the h203 group additionally the precipitation in the summer fallow season was lower and there was higher precipitation during the seedling stage in the l203 group than in the h203 group fig 3 this indicated that precipitation in the summer fallow season was a dominant factor driving the increase in winter grain yield in the l203 group 3 2 wheat biomass yield harvest index yield components and sowing rates significant differences in wheat biomass yield and harvest index were observed among the three subgroups in both the l203 and h203 groups table 2 the average wheat biomass and yield in the low moderate and high yield subgroups in the l203 group were lower than those in the h203 group in the l203 group the low yield subgroup had a lower sowing rate 1000 kernel weight kernel number and spike number than the high yield subgroup in the h203 group differences in kernel and spike number were also observed among the yield subgroups being higher in the high subgroup but no significant differences in kernel weight and sowing rate were observed among the three yield subgroups in addition the average sowing rate in the l203 group 184 4 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than that in the h203 group 146 2 kg ha 1 while the spike number and kernel number in the l203 group were lower than those in the h203 group with averages of 3 18 106 ha 1 and 28 0 spike 1 and 4 29 106 ha 1 and 37 3 spike 1 respectively in the l203 and h203 groups these results indicated that the seeding rate and plant population should be considered for increasing dryland wheat yield and spike number 3 3 nutrient input and nutrient uptake in aboveground wheat biomass in the l203 group n fertilization rates were not significantly different among the low moderate and high yield subgroups fig 4a however the p and k rates were different among the three subgroups with the highest rates in the moderate yield subgroup and lowest rates in the high yield subgroup in the h203 group n application rates significantly increased with increasing wheat yield but there were no significant differences in p and k fertilization rates among the three yield subgroups unlike the fertilizer application rates the n p and k uptake by wheat significantly increased with increasing grain yield fig 4b the uptake of n was much lower than the n fertilization rates in all the yield subgroups in l203 and in the moderate and low yield subgroups in h203 the same pattern was observed for p in both l203 and h203 the k uptake in the low and moderate yield subgroups was similar although it was much higher than the k fertilization rate in the high yield subgroup in l203 and in all three yield subgroups in h203 in addition the k fertilization rates in the l203 group were even greater than the nutrient uptake by the wheat grains 3 4 soil physiochemical properties under the conditions in the l203 and h203 groups no significant differences were observed in soil som tn or ph contents among the low moderate and high yield subgroups in either the l203 and h203 groups table 3 but the available k in the low yield subgroup was significantly higher than that in the moderate and high yield subgroups the soil mineral n and available p in the low yield subgroup were significantly lower than those in the high yield subgroup in h203 but no significant difference was found between these two subgroups in l203 table 3 the average som mineral n and available olsen p contents were 11 8 g kg 1 9 5 mg kg 1 and 11 2 mg kg 1 respectively in the l203 group and these values were significantly lower than those in the h203 group 12 8 g kg 1 21 5 mg kg 1 and 15 1 mg kg 1 respectively this revealed that high soil fertility produced a high wheat yield 3 5 tailoring agricultural management for increasing wheat yields and benefits and decreasing environmental effects in addition to the wheat sowing rate the regulation of soil available n p and k was obviously another option for increasing the wheat yield by optimizing fertilizer input for the management of the nutrient inputs in the l203 group the n p and k fertilizer rates should be optimized according to yield level table 4 compared to the recommended rates farmers fertilizer application rates should be reduced by an average of 54 4 kg n ha 1 48 9 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 33 1 kg k2o ha 1 economic returns could be increased by 94 9 33 8 and 3 2 and ghg emissions could be decreased by 28 8 24 6 and 12 8 for the three yield subgroups in the h203 group the wheat grain yield can be increased from a low to a high level by optimizing the fertilizer rates if yield is increased from the low to the moderate subgroup l to m from the moderate to the high subgroup m to h or from the low to the high subgroup l to h the n rates should be increased by 21 6 24 0 and 45 6 kg n ha 1 respectively while the p rates should be reduced by 66 8 36 1 and 48 9 kg p2o5 ha 1 and the k rates should be not regulated economic returns could be increased by 68 2 51 9 and 54 2 respectively but the ghg emissions could only be decreased only in the l to m scenario 4 discussion 4 1 the relationships between wheat grain yield and precipitation previous studies have pointed out that precipitation in the summer fallow season was the key factor affecting the available soil water at planting lyon et al 2007 nielsen and vigil 2018 nielsen et al 2002 and that there was a linear response of winter wheat grain yield to available soil water at planting or available water in the soil proﬁle plus precipitation nielsen et al 2002 schillinger et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 however few studies have focused on the relationship between wheat grain yield and precipitation in the summer fallow period which is more accessible by small household farmers than the available soil water at planting moeller et al 2009 the data from the current study clearly showed that the response of wheat grain yield to precipitation in the summer fallow season followed a linear plateau model fig 1a this confirmed our previous results which found nonlinear associations between wheat yield and precipitation in the summer fallow period cao et al 2017 our results also indicated that wheat grain yield mainly depended on precipitation in the summer fallow season in the l203 group and that the rate of 203 mm was the minimum summer fallow precipitation needed to obtain high wheat yield nielsen and vigil 2018 showed similar results the lowest amount of available soil water at wheat planting was 100 mm 0 1 8 m soil layers for continuously cropped rotations furthermore our results showed that the precipitation in the summer fallow season accounted for 36 3 and 60 6 of the total annual precipitation in the l203 and h203 groups respectively and that the precipitation in the summer fallow season was significantly lower while the precipitation during the seedling stage was significantly higher in the l203 group than that in the h203 group fig 3 these results indicated that more precipitation during the seedling stage in the l203 group did not significantly increase wheat yield thus suggesting that precipitation during the growing season in dryland soils is not enough to meet wheat water requirements other studies had similar results for example continuous cropping and the elimination of fallow reduced winter wheat yield from 2920 wheat fallow system to 1420 kg ha 1 in the central great plains of the usa nielsen et al 2002 and the wheat grain yield of the second wheat crop was 80 of that of the first wheat crop in a wheat wheat sorghum fallow system in kansas usa schlegel et al 2017 from the previous studies the precipitation in wheat growing season also has an important role in wheat yield in drylands engel 1991 zhang et al 2010 in our present study the precipitation in wheat growing season with 261 and 219 mm for l203 and h203 group respectively did not had a liner relationship with wheat yield fig 2b however the yearly precipitation 410 mm for l203 group vs 567 mm for h203 group also fitted a linear plateau model with wheat yield with a criteria of 625 mm data not shown because of the relationship between the precipitation in summer fallow season and wheat yield fig 2a these results emphasized that the precipitation in summer fallow season had a stronger relationship with the wheat yield in addition we found that the soil moisture in top soil layer 20 cm in the h203 group 10 70 was higher than that in the l203 group 8 81 at the sampling time which indicated that the high precipitation in summer fallow season could result in more soil water for wheat growth 4 2 optimization of sowing rates based on precipitation even though the linear plateau model revealed that wheat grain yield can be maintained at a relatively stable high level when the precipitation in the summer fallow season is higher than 203 mm there was still a large variation in wheat grain yield in the h203 group at different experimental sites fig 1a similar results were found in other countries with semiarid areas such as iran khasheisiuki et al 2011 and australia anderson 2010 these results indicated that wheat grain yield might rely on other agricultural management practices and that grain yield in the h203 group might be increased by adequate adaptation measures the present results showed that significant differences in wheat biomass yield and harvest index were observed among the three yield subgroups in both the l203 and h203 groups table 2 further analysis found that the cause of the low yield and yield components was mainly due to the low sowing rate 167 9 kg ha 1 in the l203 group table 2 which meant that a high sowing rate 197 9 kg ha 1 may be required to achieve a high yield 5 2 t ha 1 in the conditions found in the l203 group considerably low seeding rates for wheat were also reported at sites in semiarid environments for instance a sowing rate of 135 kg ha 1 led to a grain yield of 3 t ha 1 in the northern great plains lafond et al 2006 a sowing rate of 150 kg ha 1 led to a grain yield of 3 5 t ha 1 in a semiarid region of china guo et al 2012 li et al 2016 and a sowing rate of 130 kg ha 1 led to a grain yield of 2 63 t ha 1 in central argentina rolla et al 2018 dai et al 2013 also confirmed that a seeding rate higher than 160 kg ha 1 significantly reduced grain yield when the water supply was sufficient however other authors reported that seeding rates were higher in wetter conditions than in comparable dryland conditions kühling et al 2017 they believed that in drought years the decrease in wheat yield with high seeding rates could be due to the greater competition for soil water i e more soil water was used before stem elongation with high seeding rates which in turn decreased dry matter production and thus yield fang et al 2010 hiltbrunner et al 2007 our results were contrary to this mainly because more precipitation could promote tillers and thus ensure a higher spike number table 2 previous studies also revealed that ensuring the spike number was essential to obtaining a high wheat yield ma et al 2017 manske et al 2010 zhou et al 2010 these results further indicated that management practices other than sowing rate could contribute to the increase in winter wheat yield under the conditions found in the h203 group 4 3 optimization of nutrient management based on precipitation there were no significant differences in the som tn mineral n available p or ph among the low moderate and high yield subgroups table 3 in the l203 group these results revealed that the low yield was not caused by soil fertility this confirmed the above results that wheat grain yields mainly depend on precipitation under the conditions found in the l203 group soil mineral n was significantly lower in the low yield subgroup than in the high yield subgroup table 3 in h203 which indicated that the regulation of soil mineral n might be an option for increasing wheat yield mcdonald 1992 soil available p was relatively high and the average was 15 0 mg kg 1 in the h203 group table 3 which was higher than the critical value of soil olsen p for winter wheat in china average 12 9 mg kg 1 bai et al 2013 khan et al 2018 tang et al 2009 furthermore p fertilization rates showed no significant differences among the yield subgroups but the values were significantly higher than the amount of uptake by wheat fig 4 all these results indicate that p fertilization rates should be reduced in the conditions found in the h203 group unlike soil n and p the average soil available k in the low yield subgroup was significantly higher than that in the moderate yield subgroup and high yield subgroup in h203 table 3 which may be attributed to high uptake by wheat and a shortage of k fertilization more than 70 of the wheat fields had no fertilizer input in the past zhao et al 2016 he et al 2015 also found that long term cropping without k fertilizer application decreased soil available k by 73 5 from the 1990 s to the 2010 s throughout china the k status of agricultural soils is also decreasing across the world in areas such as europe africa asia and north america dobermann et al 1998 malo et al 2005 according to the management policy for wheat straw of the chinese government ndrc 2009 almost all wheat straw is returned to the field therefore a suitable k supply is essential to maintain soil fertility and the rate of k removed in wheat grains should be applied to the field i e up to 27 9 kg k2o ha 1 should be applied if a high wheat yield is attained although china has successfully fed more than 20 of the global population with only 8 of the total arable land zhang et al 2012 the grain yield still needs to increase because the area of cultivated land and the proportion of grain crops to the total area of cultivated arable land are decreasing annually chen et al 2016 however in recent decades the increase in grain yield mainly depended on the application of a large amount of chemical fertilizers wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 2016 this situation is more serious in dryland areas in china than in other areas therefore there is an urgent need to reduce fertilizer application rates according to the fertilizer recommendations developed with the methods described by cao et al 2017 there is great potential to reduce fertilizer rates in the l203 group the average n p and k fertilizer application rates could be easily reduced by 54 4 kg n ha 1 48 9 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 33 1 kg k2o ha 1 respectively table 4 thus the average economic benefit will be increased by 43 9 fortunately there is a positive relationship between fertilizer inputs and ghg emissions especially for n fertilizer cui et al 2018 thus ghg emissions will be reduced by 22 1 as fertilizer inputs decrease as a result reasonable fertilizer inputs in the l203 group will not only increase economic benefits but also decrease environmental risks fig 5 in contrast the results revealed that there is great potential for increasing winter wheat yield through the appropriate management of nutrient and agriculture practices under the conditions found in the h203 group it is clear that the maximum yield increase can be achieved with high n and low p inputs i e the average n rate should be increased by 30 4 kg n ha 1 and the p rate should be decreased by 50 6 kg p2o5 ha 1 in the three scenarios l to m m to h and l to h table 4 similar results also showed that a high nitrogen fertilizer rate was needed to achieve a higher yield under above average precipitation conditions than under below average precipitation conditions in mediterranean environments moeller et al 2009 additionally increasing the n fertilization rate increased wheat production in south america mazzilli et al 2016 and narrowed the yield gap of wheat in australia hochman and horan 2018 finally the average economic return will increase by 87 1 and the value ghg emissions will increase by 10 if winter wheat yield increases from the low subgroup to the high subgroup because of the high nitrogen fertilizer application rate table 4 therefore increasing winter wheat yield from the low subgroup to the moderate subgroup or from the moderate to the high subgroup in h203 may be a better option based on the tradeoffs between economic return and environmental security fig 5 5 conclusions the wheat grain yield followed a linear plateau pattern relative to the precipitation in the summer fallow season in the l203 group the wheat grain yield mainly depended on precipitation and low spike number resulted in low yield which suggested that adopting an optimum wheat sowing rate and reducing n p and k fertilizer application rates are tailored agricultural management practices for increasing wheat yield and reducing environmental effects in the h203 group the differences in kernel spike number n fertilizer rates and soil available n and p were differed among the low moderate and high yield subgroups which indicated that increasing wheat sowing rate and n fertilizer rates are important measures to increase wheat yield overall the wheat sowing rate and fertilizer input rates can be optimized to increase the wheat yield and farmers income and promote agricultural management for dryland wheat production declaration of competing

9593,precipitation has been recognized as the dominant factor driving crop grain yields and large yield variations in drylands which suggests that some agricultural management practices can be optimized to achieve high yields and benefits in this study we investigated 804 farmers wheat fields from 2015 to 2018 in the dryland area of the loess plateau in china and analyzed the relationships between wheat yield and the influence factors including precipitation wheat sowing rate fertilizer inputs and soil nutrients to propose optimized agricultural management practices for wheat production the results showed that wheat grain yield followed a linear plateau pattern relative to the precipitation in the summer fallow season with a yield of 5344 kg ha 1 obtained at a precipitation of 203 mm in the l203 group precipitation in the summer fallow season less than 203 mm the low yield subgroup 0 33th in grain yield group in order from low to high had a lower sowing rate kernel weight kernel number and spike number than the high yield subgroup 68 100th in grain yield group different levels of phosphorous p and potassium k fertilizer overuse were found among the three yield subgroups however in the h203 group precipitation in the summer fallow season greater than 203 mm differences in only kernel and spike numbers and nitrogen n fertilizer application rate were observed among the low moderate and high yield subgroups additionally there were no differences in the soil organic matter som total n or ph in the three subgroups in either l203 or h203 but significant differences in soil mineral n available p and k were observed among the three subgroups except mineral n in l203 based on these results the wheat sowing rate and fertilizer input rates can be optimized to increase wheat yield and farmers income and promote agricultural management for dryland wheat production on the loess plateau keywords rainfall yield variation nutrient management wheat production dryland 1 introduction wheat covers 220 million hectares of agricultural lands worldwide fao 2021 of which 66 are drylands khasheisiuki et al 2011 and provides 766 million tons of grain in 2019 fao 2021 since the global food demand will increase by 35 56 between 2010 and 2050 van dijk et al 2021 due to rapid urbanization and population increases crop yield increases are an inevitable challenge especially in drylands where there has large variations in wheat yield with 0 61 2 75 t ha 1 in eastern australia feng et al 2018 0 6 8 t ha 1 in eastern washington schillinger et al 2008 0 75 8 25 t ha 1 in northwestern china cao et al 2017 and 0 5 5 t ha 1 in central argentina rolla et al 2018 these variations are due to agronomic practices and climate anderson 2010 lollato et al 2019 mueller et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2010 which can provide potential opportunities for understanding factors constraining wheat yield increases in drylands precipitation has been recognized as the dominant factor affecting grain yields and large yield variations annual precipitation varied from 200 to 700 mm in the last 50 years in western australia ludwig et al 2009 and this factor explained approximately 40 of the total wheat yield variation ray et al 2015 on the north china plain up to 20 of the yield variation was caused by weather factors including precipitation and temperature zhang et al 2013 yield variation exists not only under different precipitation conditions but also under similar precipitation conditions it was found that wheat yield ranged from 50 to 1000 kg ha 1 when the precipitation was approximately 200 mm in the growing season in iran khasheisiuki et al 2011 from 1000 to 3500 kg ha 1 when the precipitation was approximately 300 mm in the growing season in western australia anderson 2010 and from 2000 to 6100 kg ha 1 when the annual precipitation was approximately 550 mm in northwestern china cao et al 2017 these results indicate that in addition to precipitation there may be other factors driving yield variations therefore it is very important to understand the links between precipitation and management practices for increasing the crop yield under similar precipitation conditions optimized fertilizer nutrient inputs seeding rates and cultivation practices have been proven to be the key ways to increase crop yields in drylands anderson 2010 carignano et al 2008 gastaldi et al 2020 hochman and horan 2018 lollato et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 2013 globally due to fertilizer strategy optimization nitrogen n fertilizer use decreased by 28 11 million tons and phosphate fertilizer use decreased by 38 5 million tons while cereal crop production increased by approximately 30 from 1997 to 2003 mueller et al 2012 moreover a reasonable increase in n fertilizer from 76 to 90 kg n ha 1 in coordination with the improvement of other agronomic practices increased wheat yield from 2348 to 4809 kg ha 1 in uruguay mazzilli et al 2016 and an increase in n fertilizer application in addition to new seeding equipment increased wheat yields nationally by 30 in australia hochman and horan 2018 in china millions of chinese smallholder farmers adopted enhanced management practices for cereal maize rice and wheat production from 2005 to 2015 the results showed that average yields increased by 10 8 11 5 application of nitrogen fertilizer decreased by 14 7 18 1 and greenhouse gas ghg emissions decreased by 13 7 22 3 cui et al 2018 these results suggest that the combination of nutrients management and other agronomical measures was of potential significance in increasing crop yield while decreasing fertilizer input and therefore decreasing the negative environmental effects e g ghg emissions n residues in soil etc of overused chemical fertilizers previous work showed that the precipitation in the fallow season after wheat harvest and before the next wheat sown was significantly correlated with winter wheat yield and could be used to predict the crop yield and its nutrient requirements in the coming season cao et al 2017 however it could not predict the yield variation in different fields and did not supply measure to increase yields based on soil fertility fertilizer management strategies and seeding and cultivation practices therefore based on an in situ farm survey in the central loess plateau of china the aim of the present study was to 1 investigate wheat yield variation under different precipitation in the fallow season 2 understand the factors controlling the yield variation and 3 propose an optimized management strategy for soil nutrients fertilization and sowing for high wheat yield to farmers in drylands of china and other similar areas of the world 2 material and methods 2 1 in situ farm

ﬁeld chen et al 2014 he et al 2018 anova was performed in sas v8 0 sas institute inc usa for statistical analysis and a least significant difference test at p 0 05 was used to assess the mean differences sigmaplot v12 5 systat software inc usa was used for regression analysis 3 results 3 1 precipitation in the summer fallow season and its relationship with wheat grain yield across the sampling area the precipitation ranged from 95 to 475 mm in the summer fallow season and 118 332 mm in the wheat growing season regression analysis showed that wheat grain yield followed a linear plateau model with precipitation in the summer fallow season p 0 001 fig 2a with a plateau yield of 5344 kg ha 1 obtained at a precipitation of 203 mm however no significant relation was found between the yield and precipitation in the growing season fig 2b based on the linear plateau model with the turning point of 203 mm the precipitation observations were categorized into two groups according to the precipitation in the summer fallow season l203 and h203 with summer fallow precipitation lower and higher than 203 mm respectively then depending on the yield differences each group was further divided into three yield subgroups low moderate and high by separating the samples into equal groups based on their yield ordered from low to high seasonal precipitation analysis showed that significant differences were observed among the low moderate and high yield groups in the l203 group but no significant differences were found in the h203 group fig 3 the precipitation of the summer fallow season in low moderate and high yield subgroups accounted for 32 3 35 4 and 41 1 respectively of the total annual precipitation in the l203 group and 61 1 60 8 and 60 0 respectively of the total annual precipitation in the h203 group additionally the precipitation in the summer fallow season was lower and there was higher precipitation during the seedling stage in the l203 group than in the h203 group fig 3 this indicated that precipitation in the summer fallow season was a dominant factor driving the increase in winter grain yield in the l203 group 3 2 wheat biomass yield harvest index yield components and sowing rates significant differences in wheat biomass yield and harvest index were observed among the three subgroups in both the l203 and h203 groups table 2 the average wheat biomass and yield in the low moderate and high yield subgroups in the l203 group were lower than those in the h203 group in the l203 group the low yield subgroup had a lower sowing rate 1000 kernel weight kernel number and spike number than the high yield subgroup in the h203 group differences in kernel and spike number were also observed among the yield subgroups being higher in the high subgroup but no significant differences in kernel weight and sowing rate were observed among the three yield subgroups in addition the average sowing rate in the l203 group 184 4 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than that in the h203 group 146 2 kg ha 1 while the spike number and kernel number in the l203 group were lower than those in the h203 group with averages of 3 18 106 ha 1 and 28 0 spike 1 and 4 29 106 ha 1 and 37 3 spike 1 respectively in the l203 and h203 groups these results indicated that the seeding rate and plant population should be considered for increasing dryland wheat yield and spike number 3 3 nutrient input and nutrient uptake in aboveground wheat biomass in the l203 group n fertilization rates were not significantly different among the low moderate and high yield subgroups fig 4a however the p and k rates were different among the three subgroups with the highest rates in the moderate yield subgroup and lowest rates in the high yield subgroup in the h203 group n application rates significantly increased with increasing wheat yield but there were no significant differences in p and k fertilization rates among the three yield subgroups unlike the fertilizer application rates the n p and k uptake by wheat significantly increased with increasing grain yield fig 4b the uptake of n was much lower than the n fertilization rates in all the yield subgroups in l203 and in the moderate and low yield subgroups in h203 the same pattern was observed for p in both l203 and h203 the k uptake in the low and moderate yield subgroups was similar although it was much higher than the k fertilization rate in the high yield subgroup in l203 and in all three yield subgroups in h203 in addition the k fertilization rates in the l203 group were even greater than the nutrient uptake by the wheat grains 3 4 soil physiochemical properties under the conditions in the l203 and h203 groups no significant differences were observed in soil som tn or ph contents among the low moderate and high yield subgroups in either the l203 and h203 groups table 3 but the available k in the low yield subgroup was significantly higher than that in the moderate and high yield subgroups the soil mineral n and available p in the low yield subgroup were significantly lower than those in the high yield subgroup in h203 but no significant difference was found between these two subgroups in l203 table 3 the average som mineral n and available olsen p contents were 11 8 g kg 1 9 5 mg kg 1 and 11 2 mg kg 1 respectively in the l203 group and these values were significantly lower than those in the h203 group 12 8 g kg 1 21 5 mg kg 1 and 15 1 mg kg 1 respectively this revealed that high soil fertility produced a high wheat yield 3 5 tailoring agricultural management for increasing wheat yields and benefits and decreasing environmental effects in addition to the wheat sowing rate the regulation of soil available n p and k was obviously another option for increasing the wheat yield by optimizing fertilizer input for the management of the nutrient inputs in the l203 group the n p and k fertilizer rates should be optimized according to yield level table 4 compared to the recommended rates farmers fertilizer application rates should be reduced by an average of 54 4 kg n ha 1 48 9 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 33 1 kg k2o ha 1 economic returns could be increased by 94 9 33 8 and 3 2 and ghg emissions could be decreased by 28 8 24 6 and 12 8 for the three yield subgroups in the h203 group the wheat grain yield can be increased from a low to a high level by optimizing the fertilizer rates if yield is increased from the low to the moderate subgroup l to m from the moderate to the high subgroup m to h or from the low to the high subgroup l to h the n rates should be increased by 21 6 24 0 and 45 6 kg n ha 1 respectively while the p rates should be reduced by 66 8 36 1 and 48 9 kg p2o5 ha 1 and the k rates should be not regulated economic returns could be increased by 68 2 51 9 and 54 2 respectively but the ghg emissions could only be decreased only in the l to m scenario 4 discussion 4 1 the relationships between wheat grain yield and precipitation previous studies have pointed out that precipitation in the summer fallow season was the key factor affecting the available soil water at planting lyon et al 2007 nielsen and vigil 2018 nielsen et al 2002 and that there was a linear response of winter wheat grain yield to available soil water at planting or available water in the soil proﬁle plus precipitation nielsen et al 2002 schillinger et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 however few studies have focused on the relationship between wheat grain yield and precipitation in the summer fallow period which is more accessible by small household farmers than the available soil water at planting moeller et al 2009 the data from the current study clearly showed that the response of wheat grain yield to precipitation in the summer fallow season followed a linear plateau model fig 1a this confirmed our previous results which found nonlinear associations between wheat yield and precipitation in the summer fallow period cao et al 2017 our results also indicated that wheat grain yield mainly depended on precipitation in the summer fallow season in the l203 group and that the rate of 203 mm was the minimum summer fallow precipitation needed to obtain high wheat yield nielsen and vigil 2018 showed similar results the lowest amount of available soil water at wheat planting was 100 mm 0 1 8 m soil layers for continuously cropped rotations furthermore our results showed that the precipitation in the summer fallow season accounted for 36 3 and 60 6 of the total annual precipitation in the l203 and h203 groups respectively and that the precipitation in the summer fallow season was significantly lower while the precipitation during the seedling stage was significantly higher in the l203 group than that in the h203 group fig 3 these results indicated that more precipitation during the seedling stage in the l203 group did not significantly increase wheat yield thus suggesting that precipitation during the growing season in dryland soils is not enough to meet wheat water requirements other studies had similar results for example continuous cropping and the elimination of fallow reduced winter wheat yield from 2920 wheat fallow system to 1420 kg ha 1 in the central great plains of the usa nielsen et al 2002 and the wheat grain yield of the second wheat crop was 80 of that of the first wheat crop in a wheat wheat sorghum fallow system in kansas usa schlegel et al 2017 from the previous studies the precipitation in wheat growing season also has an important role in wheat yield in drylands engel 1991 zhang et al 2010 in our present study the precipitation in wheat growing season with 261 and 219 mm for l203 and h203 group respectively did not had a liner relationship with wheat yield fig 2b however the yearly precipitation 410 mm for l203 group vs 567 mm for h203 group also fitted a linear plateau model with wheat yield with a criteria of 625 mm data not shown because of the relationship between the precipitation in summer fallow season and wheat yield fig 2a these results emphasized that the precipitation in summer fallow season had a stronger relationship with the wheat yield in addition we found that the soil moisture in top soil layer 20 cm in the h203 group 10 70 was higher than that in the l203 group 8 81 at the sampling time which indicated that the high precipitation in summer fallow season could result in more soil water for wheat growth 4 2 optimization of sowing rates based on precipitation even though the linear plateau model revealed that wheat grain yield can be maintained at a relatively stable high level when the precipitation in the summer fallow season is higher than 203 mm there was still a large variation in wheat grain yield in the h203 group at different experimental sites fig 1a similar results were found in other countries with semiarid areas such as iran khasheisiuki et al 2011 and australia anderson 2010 these results indicated that wheat grain yield might rely on other agricultural management practices and that grain yield in the h203 group might be increased by adequate adaptation measures the present results showed that significant differences in wheat biomass yield and harvest index were observed among the three yield subgroups in both the l203 and h203 groups table 2 further analysis found that the cause of the low yield and yield components was mainly due to the low sowing rate 167 9 kg ha 1 in the l203 group table 2 which meant that a high sowing rate 197 9 kg ha 1 may be required to achieve a high yield 5 2 t ha 1 in the conditions found in the l203 group considerably low seeding rates for wheat were also reported at sites in semiarid environments for instance a sowing rate of 135 kg ha 1 led to a grain yield of 3 t ha 1 in the northern great plains lafond et al 2006 a sowing rate of 150 kg ha 1 led to a grain yield of 3 5 t ha 1 in a semiarid region of china guo et al 2012 li et al 2016 and a sowing rate of 130 kg ha 1 led to a grain yield of 2 63 t ha 1 in central argentina rolla et al 2018 dai et al 2013 also confirmed that a seeding rate higher than 160 kg ha 1 significantly reduced grain yield when the water supply was sufficient however other authors reported that seeding rates were higher in wetter conditions than in comparable dryland conditions kühling et al 2017 they believed that in drought years the decrease in wheat yield with high seeding rates could be due to the greater competition for soil water i e more soil water was used before stem elongation with high seeding rates which in turn decreased dry matter production and thus yield fang et al 2010 hiltbrunner et al 2007 our results were contrary to this mainly because more precipitation could promote tillers and thus ensure a higher spike number table 2 previous studies also revealed that ensuring the spike number was essential to obtaining a high wheat yield ma et al 2017 manske et al 2010 zhou et al 2010 these results further indicated that management practices other than sowing rate could contribute to the increase in winter wheat yield under the conditions found in the h203 group 4 3 optimization of nutrient management based on precipitation there were no significant differences in the som tn mineral n available p or ph among the low moderate and high yield subgroups table 3 in the l203 group these results revealed that the low yield was not caused by soil fertility this confirmed the above results that wheat grain yields mainly depend on precipitation under the conditions found in the l203 group soil mineral n was significantly lower in the low yield subgroup than in the high yield subgroup table 3 in h203 which indicated that the regulation of soil mineral n might be an option for increasing wheat yield mcdonald 1992 soil available p was relatively high and the average was 15 0 mg kg 1 in the h203 group table 3 which was higher than the critical value of soil olsen p for winter wheat in china average 12 9 mg kg 1 bai et al 2013 khan et al 2018 tang et al 2009 furthermore p fertilization rates showed no significant differences among the yield subgroups but the values were significantly higher than the amount of uptake by wheat fig 4 all these results indicate that p fertilization rates should be reduced in the conditions found in the h203 group unlike soil n and p the average soil available k in the low yield subgroup was significantly higher than that in the moderate yield subgroup and high yield subgroup in h203 table 3 which may be attributed to high uptake by wheat and a shortage of k fertilization more than 70 of the wheat fields had no fertilizer input in the past zhao et al 2016 he et al 2015 also found that long term cropping without k fertilizer application decreased soil available k by 73 5 from the 1990 s to the 2010 s throughout china the k status of agricultural soils is also decreasing across the world in areas such as europe africa asia and north america dobermann et al 1998 malo et al 2005 according to the management policy for wheat straw of the chinese government ndrc 2009 almost all wheat straw is returned to the field therefore a suitable k supply is essential to maintain soil fertility and the rate of k removed in wheat grains should be applied to the field i e up to 27 9 kg k2o ha 1 should be applied if a high wheat yield is attained although china has successfully fed more than 20 of the global population with only 8 of the total arable land zhang et al 2012 the grain yield still needs to increase because the area of cultivated land and the proportion of grain crops to the total area of cultivated arable land are decreasing annually chen et al 2016 however in recent decades the increase in grain yield mainly depended on the application of a large amount of chemical fertilizers wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 2016 this situation is more serious in dryland areas in china than in other areas therefore there is an urgent need to reduce fertilizer application rates according to the fertilizer recommendations developed with the methods described by cao et al 2017 there is great potential to reduce fertilizer rates in the l203 group the average n p and k fertilizer application rates could be easily reduced by 54 4 kg n ha 1 48 9 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 33 1 kg k2o ha 1 respectively table 4 thus the average economic benefit will be increased by 43 9 fortunately there is a positive relationship between fertilizer inputs and ghg emissions especially for n fertilizer cui et al 2018 thus ghg emissions will be reduced by 22 1 as fertilizer inputs decrease as a result reasonable fertilizer inputs in the l203 group will not only increase economic benefits but also decrease environmental risks fig 5 in contrast the results revealed that there is great potential for increasing winter wheat yield through the appropriate management of nutrient and agriculture practices under the conditions found in the h203 group it is clear that the maximum yield increase can be achieved with high n and low p inputs i e the average n rate should be increased by 30 4 kg n ha 1 and the p rate should be decreased by 50 6 kg p2o5 ha 1 in the three scenarios l to m m to h and l to h table 4 similar results also showed that a high nitrogen fertilizer rate was needed to achieve a higher yield under above average precipitation conditions than under below average precipitation conditions in mediterranean environments moeller et al 2009 additionally increasing the n fertilization rate increased wheat production in south america mazzilli et al 2016 and narrowed the yield gap of wheat in australia hochman and horan 2018 finally the average economic return will increase by 87 1 and the value ghg emissions will increase by 10 if winter wheat yield increases from the low subgroup to the high subgroup because of the high nitrogen fertilizer application rate table 4 therefore increasing winter wheat yield from the low subgroup to the moderate subgroup or from the moderate to the high subgroup in h203 may be a better option based on the tradeoffs between economic return and environmental security fig 5 5 conclusions the wheat grain yield followed a linear plateau pattern relative to the precipitation in the summer fallow season in the l203 group the wheat grain yield mainly depended on precipitation and low spike number resulted in low yield which suggested that adopting an optimum wheat sowing rate and reducing n p and k fertilizer application rates are tailored agricultural management practices for increasing wheat yield and reducing environmental effects in the h203 group the differences in kernel spike number n fertilizer rates and soil available n and p were differed among the low moderate and high yield subgroups which indicated that increasing wheat sowing rate and n fertilizer rates are important measures to increase wheat yield overall the wheat sowing rate and fertilizer input rates can be optimized to increase the wheat yield and farmers income and promote agricultural management for dryland wheat production declaration of competing

9594,high crop water productivity wpc and fertilizer use efficiency are the key to ensuring the sustainable development of agriculture in water deficient areas such as the northwest china in order to determine the irrigation amount and potassium rate for optimizing potato yield plant potassium accumulation and wpc of drip irrigated potato a two year field experiment was conducted on the loess plateau of northwest china with three irrigation levels w1 60 etc w2 80 etc and w3 100 etc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration and four potassium levels k0 kg ha 1 k1 135 kg ha 1 k2 270 kg ha 1 and k3 405 kg ha 1 the results showed that leaf area index chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter tuber yield starch vitamin c content and wpc generally increased with the increase of irrigation amount while they first increased and then decreased with the increasing potassium rate the trends of reducing sugar and potassium use efficiency were contrary to the above trends the residue of available potassium in the soil increased with the increase of potassium rate but decreased with the increase of irrigation amount irrigation amount and potassium rate had interaction effects on chlorophyll content dry matter tuber yield reducing sugar plant potassium accumulation and potassium use efficiency to ensure high yield high quality water saving and fertilizer saving potato production a water input irrigation plus effective rainfall range of 498 520 mm combined with a potassium rate range of 201 393 kg ha 1 was recommended these results can provide a theoretical basis for the rational application of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer to improve tuber yield quality and soil environment of drip irrigated potato in northwest china keywords irrigation amount potassium rate plant growth tuber yield irrigation water productivity 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is the fourth largest food crop in the world after wheat maize and rice it has very important edible nutritional and industrial value fao 2016 china is the largest potato production and output country in the world with an output of 91 88 million tons accounting for 24 81 of the global potato production in 2019 fao 2021 the arable land with potassium deficiency in china exceeded 22 7 million ha accounting for 23 of the national total wu et al 2011 the conventional excessive irrigation and fertilization can lead to low crop water productivity wpc and fertilizer use efficiency waste of water and contamination of water resources wang et al 2019 as a water sensitive and high potassium requiring crop both water and potassium fertilizer are important factors affecting the growth of potato djaman et al 2021 singh et al 2020 therefore it is very important to improve crop water productivity wpc and potassium use efficiency kue while maintaining higher tuber yield and quality of potato in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china by applying the drip fertigation technology and optimizing water and fertilizer inputs fan et al 2017 wang et al 2019 2021b due to the sensitivity of potato to drought and limited available water resources limiting crop production researchers have tried to optimize potato yield and improve wpc under different irrigation methods and amounts djaman et al 2021 potato is one of the most sensitive crops to water stress because of its shallow rooting system onder et al 2005 ahmadi et al 2011 and the sensitivity of potato leaf characteristics romero et al 2017 with the decrease in irrigation amount tuber yield and big potato rate decreased significantly but the irrigation efficiency increased significantly cao et al 2019 camargo et al 2015 in order to ensure the sustainable potato production soil water content should be greater than 50 of the total available water in the soil singh 1969 foti et al 1995 reported that the highest tuber yield was obtained when the maximum evapotranspiration water supply was 133 on the contrary karafyllidis et al 1996 obtained the highest potato yield at 65 of the maximum evapotranspiration therefore the sustainable water management is needed to optimize potato yield and water productivity while maintaining maximum tuber yield and quality djaman et al 2021 potassium is the most nutrient absorbed by potato grzebisz et al 2020 khan et al 2012 li et al 2015 at the same time potassium plays an important role in promoting chloroplast development leaf photosynthesis and respiration improving lodging resistance and disease resistance promoting plant dry matter transport and accumulation and delaying plant senescence bishal et al 2019 khan et al 2012 torabian et al 2021 which helps plants absorb appropriate nutrients and water in time singh et al 2020 therefore insufficient potassium supply is considered to be a serious limiting factor for tuber yield and quality bhattarai and swarnima 2016 sarkaria and chahal 2020 however some studies also found that excessive application of potassium fertilizer would also have adverse effects on potato growth tuber yield and quality khan et al 2010 2012 through balanced application of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium it has great potential to improve the yield and quality of potato alva et al 2011 ati et al 2012 adopted three potassium treatments and two irrigation methods and found that furrow irrigation and drip irrigation had no significant effect on tuber yield but potassium application significantly improved the yield and water productivity in summary it is important to determine the potassium rate to facilitate potato growth and maintain high kue previous studies have mainly focused on the independent effect of irrigation amount cao et al 2019 djaman et al 2021 or potassium rate hannan et al 2011 khan et al 2012 li et al 2015 on potato production besides the interaction effects of water and fertilizer on potato growth yield and nutrient uptake have mainly concentrated on water nitrogen interaction song et al 2013 fandika et al 2016 ferreira and carr 2002 xing et al 2021 few studies have investigated the interaction effects of water and potassium on potato potassium uptake and soil potassium residue to decrease the risk leaching to groundwater and comprehensively improve plant growth tuber yield potassium uptake and water productivity through a two year field experiment the effects of irrigation amount and potassium rate on potato growth tuber yield quality wpc plant potassium accumulation and soil potassium residues were explored in this study meanwhile the appropriate ranges of irrigation amount and potassium rate were determined by a binary quadratic regression model bqrm to save water and potassium resources while maintaining high potato yield

irrigation amount and potassium rate had extremely significant effects on lai chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter and tuber yield p 0 01 table 1 irrigation amount and potassium rate had significant interaction effects on chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter and tuber yield p 0 05 it can be seen from fig 3 that chlorophyll content and lai first increased and then decreased during the growth period under the same irrigation level potassium rate had a significant positive effect on the increase of lai and chlorophyll and they first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate and finally reached the maximum value under k2 however the effect of potassium rate on the increase of lai and chlorophyll content was not obvious under w1 but those two values increased significantly under w2 and w3 at the later stage of growth period lai decreased due to the senescence of the plants under w2 and w3 the time point of lai peak value appeared later fig 3b c e f similar trends were also found for chlorophyll content fig 3h i k m the average total aboveground dry matter of w3 was 28 3 and 56 5 higher than that of w2 and w1 in 2019 and 34 0 and 52 1 higher in 2020 respectively fig 4a b the aboveground dry matter accumulation increased with the increase of potassium rate under w2 and w3 in 2019 and under w3 in 2020 under the other irrigation conditions they first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate in most treatments the accumulative aboveground dry matter in 2019 was greater than that in 2020 compared with k0 k1 k2 and k3 increased the average yield by 1 3 17 3 and 15 5 in 2019 while it was 10 7 24 0 and 19 3 in 2020 respectively compared with w3 w1 and w2 reduced the average tuber yield by 8 0 and 12 9 in 2019 and by 8 9 and 14 7 in 2020 respectively fig 4c d 3 2 tuber quality the irrigation amount and potassium rate had an extremely significant impact on the three quality indicators p 0 01 table 1 and year y had extremely significant effect on starch content p 0 01 table1 the interaction of w y y k y w k also had extremely significant effects on reducing sugars p 0 01 table 1 it can be seen from fig 5a b that the starch content of tubers first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate peaking at k2 under w2 and w3 with the increase of irrigation amount starch had an increasing trend compared with w1 the average starch under w2 and w3 was increased by 4 2 and 6 3 in 2019 and by 6 8 and 8 9 in 2020 respectively this indicated that irrigation amount had a greater impact on the increase of starch in 2020 than in 2019 similar trends were also found for tuber vitamin c fig 5c d but the opposite trend was found in reducing sugars in general the reducing sugar content of tubers gradually decreased with the increase of irrigation amount except for w1 in 2020 the content of reducing sugars under w2 and w3 decreased first and then increased with the increase of potassium rate and the minimum value occurred at k2 under w1 and w3 in 2019 and under w2 and w3 in 2020 fig 5e f 3 3 et wpc wpi plant k accumulation and kue it can be seen from table 3 that the irrigation amount and potassium rate had significant effects on crop water productivity wpc irrigation water productivity wpi potassium use efficiency kue and plant potassium accumulation p 0 01 table 2 and irrigation amount and potassium application had extremely significant interaction effects on kue and plant potassium accumulation p 0 01 table 2 the water consumption et during the whole growth period of potato first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate while it increased with the increase of irrigation amount except for w1 in 2019 and 2020 wpc under the other irrigation treatments increased first and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate generally speaking kue first decreased and then increased with the increase of potassium rate in most irrigation treatments except for w3 in 2019 and w1 in 2020 as the potassium rate increased wpi first increased and then decreased under the same irrigation amount except for w1 in 2020 under the same potassium rate kue wpc and wpi showed a downward trend with the increase of irrigation amount plant potassium accumulation increased with the increase of irrigation amount and first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate table 2 fig 4 3 4 distribution of soil available potassium in potato root zone it can be seen from fig 6 that the change range of soil available potassium content was 24 7 238 6 mg kg 1 in 2019 and 36 4 260 mg kg 1 in 2020 the content of available potassium in the soil increased with the increase of potassium rate and decreased with the increase of irrigation amount the greater the irrigation amount the lower the accumulation center of soil available potassium residues as shown in fig 6a b available potassium was mainly concentrated in 0 30 cm under w1 but under w2 and w3 the accumulation center of available potassium moved downward mostly concentrated in 30 50 cm generally speaking the farther away from the dripper the lower the content of available potassium the available potassium content below 60 cm was lowest in the entire vertical direction at the same time from fig a2 in appendix a the accumulation of potassium at 20 40 cm in w2 was increased compared with that in w1 while the accumulation of potassium at 0 20 cm was decreased the potassium accumulation of 0 60 cm soil layer under w3 was lower than that under w1 and w2 in each potassium treatment 3 5 correlation between tuber yield and other indicators fig 7 represents the relationships among the main growth indexes leaf area index dry matter and chlorophyll tuber yield quality indexes tuber starch and reducing sugar content plant water consumption et and plant potassium accumulation in different water and potassium treatments there were significant p 0 05 correlations between tuber yield and lai chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter starch content et and reducing sugar content and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 42 to 0 84 fig 7 however the reducing sugar content was negatively correlated with the other indicators and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 49 to 0 70 3 6 relationships between tuber yield plant potassium accumulation wpi starch content and total water input and potassium rate in this study tuber yield total plant potassium accumulation wpi and starch content were used as dependent variables and the total water input irrigation plus effective rainfall and potassium rate during the two year period were used as independent variables based on the least squares method was used to analyze the data using mathematica 9 0 and a binary quadratic regression equation was established to calculate irrigation amount and potassium rate that maximized the above parameters table 3 based on the three dimensional surface map fig 8 it can be seen from table 3 that the relationships between the four dependent variables and the input of water and potassium rate were all significant p 0 01 and r2 was greater than 0 5 it was difficult to achieve the maximum values of the above four dependent variables at the same time wpi achieved the maximum value under relatively low water input but yield starch and plant potassium accumulation achieved the maximum under relatively high water input and potassium rate by solving the 95 confidence interval of the maximum value it was found that when the wpi reached the 95 maximum it did not intersect the total water input and potassium rate when the other dependent variables reached the 95 maximum after several attempts it was found that when tuber yield plant potassium accumulation and starch content simultaneously reached 95 of the maximum values and wpi reached 70 of the maximum value the colored part in fig 8 the total water input irrigation plus effective rainfall was in the range of 498 520 mm and the potassium rate was in the range of 201 393 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 lai chlorophyll content dry matter and tuber yield leaves are the main organs of plants for photosynthesis chlorophyll is the material physiological basis of photosynthesis which plays the role of collecting and assimilating light energy wang et al 2015 the larger the lai and chlorophyll the higher the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant torabian et al 2021 found that increasing the amount of potassium in the soil led to the increase of vegetative growth plant height and leaf area index of potato plants which was consistent with our results the effect of potassium rate on the increase of lai and chlorophyll was not obvious under w1 but they increased significantly under w2 and w3 this can be due to that the increase of soil water content promoted the effects of potassium interaction effects and plant absorption of potassium table 1 and table 3 lai chlorophyll aboveground dry matter increased with the increase of irrigation amount which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2017b as a stress reliever potassium mitigated drought s negative impacts by regulating or improving stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate and potato growth by strengthening the source to sink relationship bahar et al 2021 in our study there was significant interaction of irrigation amount and potassium rate on chlorophyll aboveground dry matter and yield table 1 this showed that the increase of potassium rate promoted the vegetative growth and potato yield and the increase of irrigation amount increased the effectiveness of potassium fertilizer however excessive potassium application had a negative impact on plant growth lai and chlorophyll fig 3 this may be because high levels of potassium inactivated the root system and reduced the nitrogen supply that may hinder plant growth allison et al 2001 zelelew et al 2016 as the cumulative product of photosynthesis dry matter reflects the law of accumulation of photocondensate transport and can indirectly explain the reason for the difference in yield in different water and potassium treatments compared with the untreated application foliar application of potassium fertilizer significantly improved the vegetative growth index thereby increasing the tuber yield per plant total carbohydrate formation of large stem increase of the number of tubers per plant and dry matter singh et al 2020 grzebisz et al 2020 which was similar to the results of this study fig 3 and fig 4 the aboveground dry matter of w2k3 and w3k3 in 2019 and w3k3 in 2020 was better than that in the other potassium treatments under same irrigation treatment but the potato yield was lower than k2 at same irrigation level the results may be due to that proper potassium rate provided better yield properties and the transfer of photosynthesis from source leaf and stem to sink tuber leading to higher tuber yield but excessive potassium application rate can interrupt this process and prevent the further yield increase chaudhari et al 2018 the water shortage at tuber formation and tuber growth stage would have a negative impact on tuber yield wang et al 2019 when the potato was subjected to drought stress the leaf chloroplast was damaged and the net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate and intercellular co2 concentration of the leaf all decreased which had an impact on the yield wang et al 2021b under the water shortage the improvement effect of potassium fertilizer was very good but it was not enough to make up for the yield gap monneveux et al 2013 fig 4 4 2 tuber quality the contents of starch vitamin c and reducing sugar in tuber are the key indexes to measure the quality of potato karam et al 2005 reported that starch content decreased under limited water supply carli et al 2014 found that the decrease of water supply after tuber formation increased starch content but decreased vitamin c content however we found that irrigation amount significantly increased the contents of starch and vitamin c p 0 01 table 1 fig 5a b c d the quality parameters such as starch and vitamin c content were significantly increased by potassium application bishal et al 2019 however some studies have shown that under the condition of full irrigation with the increase of fertilizer rate starch and vitamin c content showed a low high low trend and the change trend of reducing sugar content was opposite to that of starch content yang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 this was similar to our results under w2 and w3 in 2019 and 2020 fig 5a b reducing the content of reducing sugar is the necessary condition to obtain high quality potato chips khan et al 2012 bhattarai et al 2016 the reduction sugar content of tubers produced under high potassium levels was 11 2 13 8 higher than that of the tubers produced under lower potassium level respectively chaudhari et al 2018 hannan et al 2011 and li et al 2015 found that increasing potassium rate increased starch content and reduced the content of reducing sugar wang et al 2021b reported that the change trend of reducing sugar was opposite to starch k has a potential to decrease reducing sugar content of potato tubers as it activates starch synthesis bishwoyog and swarnima 2016 in our study high potassium rate and no potassium application led to a high reduction sugar content in tubers fig 5e f there was also a significant interaction between water and potassium on reducing sugar content table 1 which was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2017b 4 3 et wpc wpi plant potassium accumulation and kue some studies showed that the water consumption of potato et increased with the increase of irrigation amount at the same fertilization level and the water consumption at the same irrigation level showed a trend of low high low song et al 2013 wang et al 2018b which was similar to our result that et increased first and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate under the same irrigation amount and it increased with the increase of irrigation amount under the same potassium rate although potassium fertilizer could not save water demand of potato it did improve wpc and wpi trehan et al 2009 ati et al 2012 which was consistent with our result however the study of yurtseven et al 2005 showed that the increase of potassium rate led to the decrease of wpc we also found that in most cases w2 and w3 in both years wpc increased first and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate at the same irrigation amount table 2 with the increase of irrigation amount both wpc and wpi decreased which was same as xing et al 2021 with the increase of potassium rate potassium accumulation in potato plants showed an increasing trend while the utilization efficiency of potassium fertilizer showed a downward trend wang et al 2015 with the increase of potassium rate tuber potassium uptake showed an increasing trend in some experimental fields while a rising first and then decreasing trend in other fields karam et al 2009 however we found that the accumulation of potassium in plants increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount table 2 kue decreased first and then increased with the increase of potassium rate under w1 and w2 in 2019 under w2 and w3 in 2020 while kue decreased with the increase of potassium rate under w3 in 2019 and under w1 in 2020 with the increase of irrigation amount the value tended to decrease table 2 we also found the interaction effects of water and potassium on plant potassium accumulation and kue indicating that the increase of water promoted the effect of potassium fertilizer on plant potassium accumulation and kue and the increase of potassium fertilizer also affected the effect of water on plant potassium accumulation and kue 4 4 soil available potassium distribution in potato root zone soil available nutrient content is closely related to crop growth and crop fertilizer utilization lu 2011 wei et al 2010 found that in the state of water deficit more soil fertilizers were lost due to volatilization when the soil water supply was sufficient fertilizer volatilization was reduced and plants grow vigorously which in turn absorbed more nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from the soil similar to this we found that when the soil moisture was sufficient w2 w3 the potassium absorbed by plants from the soil increased table 2 however the potassium residue under high potassium k3 was largest indicating that too much potassium fertilizer application did not cause plants to absorb excess potassium and potato plants had limited absorption of potassium fertilizer this was consistent with the results of tan et al 2007 and zhang et al 2017a the reason may be that the combined application of potassium fertilizer on the basis of nitrogen and phosphorus can slow down potassium depletion and maintain potassium balance sun et al 2012 at the same time the content of available potassium below 60 cm was lowest in the entire vertical direction and there was no peak value this was possibly due to that the sandy soil below 60 cm was difficult to retain water and fertilizer and eventually promoted the vertical and horizontal migration of available potassium as shown in fig 6 and fig 2a the layer of below soil surface 60 100 cm had lowest potassium accumulation the maximum peak of available potassium had a downward trend with the increase of irrigation amount which was consistent with the result of wang et al 2021a 2021b high fertilizer treatments can achieve high yields while increasing the risk of nutrient residue and loss which was detrimental to environmental benefits 4 5 correlation between tuber yield and other indicators studies have shown that the dry matter was related to the content of starch protein and mineral compounds in potatoes neshev and manolov 2015 this study found that the total dry matter weight had a positive correlation with leaf area index r2 0 58 chlorophyll content r2 0 82 starch content r2 0 84 tuber yield r2 0 84 water consumption r2 0 81 and potassium accumulation r2 0 87 fig 8 these positive correlations indicated that the effects of reasonable irrigation and potassium fertilizer made the plant absorb more potassium and water which promoted root growth and the chlorophyll content would increase to get more sunlight accumulate more light contracted substances and aboveground dry matter weight and at the same time transport more assimilated substances to obtain greater yield and greater accumulation of starch content singh 2020 basically the correlation between plant growth and yield and the amount of water received suggested that the more water applied the better the potato performed wagg et al 2021 similarly potassium application would change the dry matter content of tubers reduce the content of reducing sugars and total phenols thereby improving quality parameters sarkaria et al 2020 this study found a negative correlation between the dry matter and reducing sugar content r2 0 58 this may be due to the potential effect of potassium to reduce the reducing sugar content of potato tubers by activating starch synthesis noor 2010 4 6 binary quadratic regression model farmers pursue higher economic benefits but lack of precise irrigation and fertilizer management models low water and fertilizer input is not conducive to high yield so farmers think that increasing irrigation and fertilizer level is an important way to reduce the risk of production wang et al 2019 however over irrigation and the abuse of fertilizer not only reduced the water productivity but also wasted fertilizer resources and cause soil structure degradation yan et al 2021 high irrigation water productivity wpi is the key to sustainable development of agriculture in water deficient areas the potassium absorption and accumulation of plants reflects the ability level of using potassium fertilizer starch as the main quality index of potato is closely related to the nutritional and edible value of potato irrigation amount and potassium rate were the main environmental factors limiting yield and quality in this study therefore the objective of this study was use binary quadratic regression model bqrm to explore best intervals of water and potassium input to ensure water and fertilizer conservation while maintaining high yield quality water productivity and plant k accumulation the three dimensional relationship among yield wpi starch content and potassium accumulation with total water input and potassium rate was constructed by the bqrm wang et al 2018b zou et al 2020 yan et al 2021 the range of total water input irrigation plus effective rainfall suitable for local high yield quality wpi and plant potassium accumulation was 498 520 mm and the range of potassium rate was 201 393 kg ha 1 5 conclusions irrigation amount and potassium rate significantly affected the growth yield and quality of potato and had interaction effects on chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter yield reducing sugar plant potassium accumulation and potassium use efficiency in all water and potassium combinations w3k2 treatment obtained the maximum yield and potassium accumulation in the two years compared with w3k3 w3k2 had less potassium residue and greater crop water productivity which was recommended as the optimal irrigation and fertilization combination to ensure high yield high quality water saving and fertilizer saving potato production an water input irrigation plusand effective rainfall range of 498 520 mm combined with a potassium rate of 201 393 ha 1 was recommended to maintain 95 maximum values of tuber yield quality and plant potassium accumulation and 70 maximum value of wpi simultaneously the results of this study are of great

9594,high crop water productivity wpc and fertilizer use efficiency are the key to ensuring the sustainable development of agriculture in water deficient areas such as the northwest china in order to determine the irrigation amount and potassium rate for optimizing potato yield plant potassium accumulation and wpc of drip irrigated potato a two year field experiment was conducted on the loess plateau of northwest china with three irrigation levels w1 60 etc w2 80 etc and w3 100 etc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration and four potassium levels k0 kg ha 1 k1 135 kg ha 1 k2 270 kg ha 1 and k3 405 kg ha 1 the results showed that leaf area index chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter tuber yield starch vitamin c content and wpc generally increased with the increase of irrigation amount while they first increased and then decreased with the increasing potassium rate the trends of reducing sugar and potassium use efficiency were contrary to the above trends the residue of available potassium in the soil increased with the increase of potassium rate but decreased with the increase of irrigation amount irrigation amount and potassium rate had interaction effects on chlorophyll content dry matter tuber yield reducing sugar plant potassium accumulation and potassium use efficiency to ensure high yield high quality water saving and fertilizer saving potato production a water input irrigation plus effective rainfall range of 498 520 mm combined with a potassium rate range of 201 393 kg ha 1 was recommended these results can provide a theoretical basis for the rational application of irrigation water and potassium fertilizer to improve tuber yield quality and soil environment of drip irrigated potato in northwest china keywords irrigation amount potassium rate plant growth tuber yield irrigation water productivity 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is the fourth largest food crop in the world after wheat maize and rice it has very important edible nutritional and industrial value fao 2016 china is the largest potato production and output country in the world with an output of 91 88 million tons accounting for 24 81 of the global potato production in 2019 fao 2021 the arable land with potassium deficiency in china exceeded 22 7 million ha accounting for 23 of the national total wu et al 2011 the conventional excessive irrigation and fertilization can lead to low crop water productivity wpc and fertilizer use efficiency waste of water and contamination of water resources wang et al 2019 as a water sensitive and high potassium requiring crop both water and potassium fertilizer are important factors affecting the growth of potato djaman et al 2021 singh et al 2020 therefore it is very important to improve crop water productivity wpc and potassium use efficiency kue while maintaining higher tuber yield and quality of potato in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china by applying the drip fertigation technology and optimizing water and fertilizer inputs fan et al 2017 wang et al 2019 2021b due to the sensitivity of potato to drought and limited available water resources limiting crop production researchers have tried to optimize potato yield and improve wpc under different irrigation methods and amounts djaman et al 2021 potato is one of the most sensitive crops to water stress because of its shallow rooting system onder et al 2005 ahmadi et al 2011 and the sensitivity of potato leaf characteristics romero et al 2017 with the decrease in irrigation amount tuber yield and big potato rate decreased significantly but the irrigation efficiency increased significantly cao et al 2019 camargo et al 2015 in order to ensure the sustainable potato production soil water content should be greater than 50 of the total available water in the soil singh 1969 foti et al 1995 reported that the highest tuber yield was obtained when the maximum evapotranspiration water supply was 133 on the contrary karafyllidis et al 1996 obtained the highest potato yield at 65 of the maximum evapotranspiration therefore the sustainable water management is needed to optimize potato yield and water productivity while maintaining maximum tuber yield and quality djaman et al 2021 potassium is the most nutrient absorbed by potato grzebisz et al 2020 khan et al 2012 li et al 2015 at the same time potassium plays an important role in promoting chloroplast development leaf photosynthesis and respiration improving lodging resistance and disease resistance promoting plant dry matter transport and accumulation and delaying plant senescence bishal et al 2019 khan et al 2012 torabian et al 2021 which helps plants absorb appropriate nutrients and water in time singh et al 2020 therefore insufficient potassium supply is considered to be a serious limiting factor for tuber yield and quality bhattarai and swarnima 2016 sarkaria and chahal 2020 however some studies also found that excessive application of potassium fertilizer would also have adverse effects on potato growth tuber yield and quality khan et al 2010 2012 through balanced application of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium it has great potential to improve the yield and quality of potato alva et al 2011 ati et al 2012 adopted three potassium treatments and two irrigation methods and found that furrow irrigation and drip irrigation had no significant effect on tuber yield but potassium application significantly improved the yield and water productivity in summary it is important to determine the potassium rate to facilitate potato growth and maintain high kue previous studies have mainly focused on the independent effect of irrigation amount cao et al 2019 djaman et al 2021 or potassium rate hannan et al 2011 khan et al 2012 li et al 2015 on potato production besides the interaction effects of water and fertilizer on potato growth yield and nutrient uptake have mainly concentrated on water nitrogen interaction song et al 2013 fandika et al 2016 ferreira and carr 2002 xing et al 2021 few studies have investigated the interaction effects of water and potassium on potato potassium uptake and soil potassium residue to decrease the risk leaching to groundwater and comprehensively improve plant growth tuber yield potassium uptake and water productivity through a two year field experiment the effects of irrigation amount and potassium rate on potato growth tuber yield quality wpc plant potassium accumulation and soil potassium residues were explored in this study meanwhile the appropriate ranges of irrigation amount and potassium rate were determined by a binary quadratic regression model bqrm to save water and potassium resources while maintaining high potato yield

only 20 mm of water w3 was applied on sunny days for fertilization the detailed irrigation and fertilization scheduling is shown in fig 3 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 lai and chlorophyll content at each growth stage three complete plants were randomly selected from each plot the leaf area index lai of the leaves was measured by the drilling method yan et al 2021 the leaf area index was the total leaf area divided by the plot area three potato leaves were randomly selected from each plot as three replicates and the fully expanded young leaves from the upper leaves of a plant were used for measuring chlorophyll content after each replicate was mixed and chopped 0 1 g fresh leaves were weighed and placed in 25 ml test tube after adding 10 ml 96 ethanol the leaves were stored in

irrigation amount and potassium rate had extremely significant effects on lai chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter and tuber yield p 0 01 table 1 irrigation amount and potassium rate had significant interaction effects on chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter and tuber yield p 0 05 it can be seen from fig 3 that chlorophyll content and lai first increased and then decreased during the growth period under the same irrigation level potassium rate had a significant positive effect on the increase of lai and chlorophyll and they first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate and finally reached the maximum value under k2 however the effect of potassium rate on the increase of lai and chlorophyll content was not obvious under w1 but those two values increased significantly under w2 and w3 at the later stage of growth period lai decreased due to the senescence of the plants under w2 and w3 the time point of lai peak value appeared later fig 3b c e f similar trends were also found for chlorophyll content fig 3h i k m the average total aboveground dry matter of w3 was 28 3 and 56 5 higher than that of w2 and w1 in 2019 and 34 0 and 52 1 higher in 2020 respectively fig 4a b the aboveground dry matter accumulation increased with the increase of potassium rate under w2 and w3 in 2019 and under w3 in 2020 under the other irrigation conditions they first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate in most treatments the accumulative aboveground dry matter in 2019 was greater than that in 2020 compared with k0 k1 k2 and k3 increased the average yield by 1 3 17 3 and 15 5 in 2019 while it was 10 7 24 0 and 19 3 in 2020 respectively compared with w3 w1 and w2 reduced the average tuber yield by 8 0 and 12 9 in 2019 and by 8 9 and 14 7 in 2020 respectively fig 4c d 3 2 tuber quality the irrigation amount and potassium rate had an extremely significant impact on the three quality indicators p 0 01 table 1 and year y had extremely significant effect on starch content p 0 01 table1 the interaction of w y y k y w k also had extremely significant effects on reducing sugars p 0 01 table 1 it can be seen from fig 5a b that the starch content of tubers first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate peaking at k2 under w2 and w3 with the increase of irrigation amount starch had an increasing trend compared with w1 the average starch under w2 and w3 was increased by 4 2 and 6 3 in 2019 and by 6 8 and 8 9 in 2020 respectively this indicated that irrigation amount had a greater impact on the increase of starch in 2020 than in 2019 similar trends were also found for tuber vitamin c fig 5c d but the opposite trend was found in reducing sugars in general the reducing sugar content of tubers gradually decreased with the increase of irrigation amount except for w1 in 2020 the content of reducing sugars under w2 and w3 decreased first and then increased with the increase of potassium rate and the minimum value occurred at k2 under w1 and w3 in 2019 and under w2 and w3 in 2020 fig 5e f 3 3 et wpc wpi plant k accumulation and kue it can be seen from table 3 that the irrigation amount and potassium rate had significant effects on crop water productivity wpc irrigation water productivity wpi potassium use efficiency kue and plant potassium accumulation p 0 01 table 2 and irrigation amount and potassium application had extremely significant interaction effects on kue and plant potassium accumulation p 0 01 table 2 the water consumption et during the whole growth period of potato first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate while it increased with the increase of irrigation amount except for w1 in 2019 and 2020 wpc under the other irrigation treatments increased first and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate generally speaking kue first decreased and then increased with the increase of potassium rate in most irrigation treatments except for w3 in 2019 and w1 in 2020 as the potassium rate increased wpi first increased and then decreased under the same irrigation amount except for w1 in 2020 under the same potassium rate kue wpc and wpi showed a downward trend with the increase of irrigation amount plant potassium accumulation increased with the increase of irrigation amount and first increased and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate table 2 fig 4 3 4 distribution of soil available potassium in potato root zone it can be seen from fig 6 that the change range of soil available potassium content was 24 7 238 6 mg kg 1 in 2019 and 36 4 260 mg kg 1 in 2020 the content of available potassium in the soil increased with the increase of potassium rate and decreased with the increase of irrigation amount the greater the irrigation amount the lower the accumulation center of soil available potassium residues as shown in fig 6a b available potassium was mainly concentrated in 0 30 cm under w1 but under w2 and w3 the accumulation center of available potassium moved downward mostly concentrated in 30 50 cm generally speaking the farther away from the dripper the lower the content of available potassium the available potassium content below 60 cm was lowest in the entire vertical direction at the same time from fig a2 in appendix a the accumulation of potassium at 20 40 cm in w2 was increased compared with that in w1 while the accumulation of potassium at 0 20 cm was decreased the potassium accumulation of 0 60 cm soil layer under w3 was lower than that under w1 and w2 in each potassium treatment 3 5 correlation between tuber yield and other indicators fig 7 represents the relationships among the main growth indexes leaf area index dry matter and chlorophyll tuber yield quality indexes tuber starch and reducing sugar content plant water consumption et and plant potassium accumulation in different water and potassium treatments there were significant p 0 05 correlations between tuber yield and lai chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter starch content et and reducing sugar content and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 42 to 0 84 fig 7 however the reducing sugar content was negatively correlated with the other indicators and the correlation coefficients ranged from 0 49 to 0 70 3 6 relationships between tuber yield plant potassium accumulation wpi starch content and total water input and potassium rate in this study tuber yield total plant potassium accumulation wpi and starch content were used as dependent variables and the total water input irrigation plus effective rainfall and potassium rate during the two year period were used as independent variables based on the least squares method was used to analyze the data using mathematica 9 0 and a binary quadratic regression equation was established to calculate irrigation amount and potassium rate that maximized the above parameters table 3 based on the three dimensional surface map fig 8 it can be seen from table 3 that the relationships between the four dependent variables and the input of water and potassium rate were all significant p 0 01 and r2 was greater than 0 5 it was difficult to achieve the maximum values of the above four dependent variables at the same time wpi achieved the maximum value under relatively low water input but yield starch and plant potassium accumulation achieved the maximum under relatively high water input and potassium rate by solving the 95 confidence interval of the maximum value it was found that when the wpi reached the 95 maximum it did not intersect the total water input and potassium rate when the other dependent variables reached the 95 maximum after several attempts it was found that when tuber yield plant potassium accumulation and starch content simultaneously reached 95 of the maximum values and wpi reached 70 of the maximum value the colored part in fig 8 the total water input irrigation plus effective rainfall was in the range of 498 520 mm and the potassium rate was in the range of 201 393 kg ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 lai chlorophyll content dry matter and tuber yield leaves are the main organs of plants for photosynthesis chlorophyll is the material physiological basis of photosynthesis which plays the role of collecting and assimilating light energy wang et al 2015 the larger the lai and chlorophyll the higher the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant torabian et al 2021 found that increasing the amount of potassium in the soil led to the increase of vegetative growth plant height and leaf area index of potato plants which was consistent with our results the effect of potassium rate on the increase of lai and chlorophyll was not obvious under w1 but they increased significantly under w2 and w3 this can be due to that the increase of soil water content promoted the effects of potassium interaction effects and plant absorption of potassium table 1 and table 3 lai chlorophyll aboveground dry matter increased with the increase of irrigation amount which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2017b as a stress reliever potassium mitigated drought s negative impacts by regulating or improving stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate and potato growth by strengthening the source to sink relationship bahar et al 2021 in our study there was significant interaction of irrigation amount and potassium rate on chlorophyll aboveground dry matter and yield table 1 this showed that the increase of potassium rate promoted the vegetative growth and potato yield and the increase of irrigation amount increased the effectiveness of potassium fertilizer however excessive potassium application had a negative impact on plant growth lai and chlorophyll fig 3 this may be because high levels of potassium inactivated the root system and reduced the nitrogen supply that may hinder plant growth allison et al 2001 zelelew et al 2016 as the cumulative product of photosynthesis dry matter reflects the law of accumulation of photocondensate transport and can indirectly explain the reason for the difference in yield in different water and potassium treatments compared with the untreated application foliar application of potassium fertilizer significantly improved the vegetative growth index thereby increasing the tuber yield per plant total carbohydrate formation of large stem increase of the number of tubers per plant and dry matter singh et al 2020 grzebisz et al 2020 which was similar to the results of this study fig 3 and fig 4 the aboveground dry matter of w2k3 and w3k3 in 2019 and w3k3 in 2020 was better than that in the other potassium treatments under same irrigation treatment but the potato yield was lower than k2 at same irrigation level the results may be due to that proper potassium rate provided better yield properties and the transfer of photosynthesis from source leaf and stem to sink tuber leading to higher tuber yield but excessive potassium application rate can interrupt this process and prevent the further yield increase chaudhari et al 2018 the water shortage at tuber formation and tuber growth stage would have a negative impact on tuber yield wang et al 2019 when the potato was subjected to drought stress the leaf chloroplast was damaged and the net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate and intercellular co2 concentration of the leaf all decreased which had an impact on the yield wang et al 2021b under the water shortage the improvement effect of potassium fertilizer was very good but it was not enough to make up for the yield gap monneveux et al 2013 fig 4 4 2 tuber quality the contents of starch vitamin c and reducing sugar in tuber are the key indexes to measure the quality of potato karam et al 2005 reported that starch content decreased under limited water supply carli et al 2014 found that the decrease of water supply after tuber formation increased starch content but decreased vitamin c content however we found that irrigation amount significantly increased the contents of starch and vitamin c p 0 01 table 1 fig 5a b c d the quality parameters such as starch and vitamin c content were significantly increased by potassium application bishal et al 2019 however some studies have shown that under the condition of full irrigation with the increase of fertilizer rate starch and vitamin c content showed a low high low trend and the change trend of reducing sugar content was opposite to that of starch content yang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 this was similar to our results under w2 and w3 in 2019 and 2020 fig 5a b reducing the content of reducing sugar is the necessary condition to obtain high quality potato chips khan et al 2012 bhattarai et al 2016 the reduction sugar content of tubers produced under high potassium levels was 11 2 13 8 higher than that of the tubers produced under lower potassium level respectively chaudhari et al 2018 hannan et al 2011 and li et al 2015 found that increasing potassium rate increased starch content and reduced the content of reducing sugar wang et al 2021b reported that the change trend of reducing sugar was opposite to starch k has a potential to decrease reducing sugar content of potato tubers as it activates starch synthesis bishwoyog and swarnima 2016 in our study high potassium rate and no potassium application led to a high reduction sugar content in tubers fig 5e f there was also a significant interaction between water and potassium on reducing sugar content table 1 which was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2017b 4 3 et wpc wpi plant potassium accumulation and kue some studies showed that the water consumption of potato et increased with the increase of irrigation amount at the same fertilization level and the water consumption at the same irrigation level showed a trend of low high low song et al 2013 wang et al 2018b which was similar to our result that et increased first and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate under the same irrigation amount and it increased with the increase of irrigation amount under the same potassium rate although potassium fertilizer could not save water demand of potato it did improve wpc and wpi trehan et al 2009 ati et al 2012 which was consistent with our result however the study of yurtseven et al 2005 showed that the increase of potassium rate led to the decrease of wpc we also found that in most cases w2 and w3 in both years wpc increased first and then decreased with the increase of potassium rate at the same irrigation amount table 2 with the increase of irrigation amount both wpc and wpi decreased which was same as xing et al 2021 with the increase of potassium rate potassium accumulation in potato plants showed an increasing trend while the utilization efficiency of potassium fertilizer showed a downward trend wang et al 2015 with the increase of potassium rate tuber potassium uptake showed an increasing trend in some experimental fields while a rising first and then decreasing trend in other fields karam et al 2009 however we found that the accumulation of potassium in plants increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount table 2 kue decreased first and then increased with the increase of potassium rate under w1 and w2 in 2019 under w2 and w3 in 2020 while kue decreased with the increase of potassium rate under w3 in 2019 and under w1 in 2020 with the increase of irrigation amount the value tended to decrease table 2 we also found the interaction effects of water and potassium on plant potassium accumulation and kue indicating that the increase of water promoted the effect of potassium fertilizer on plant potassium accumulation and kue and the increase of potassium fertilizer also affected the effect of water on plant potassium accumulation and kue 4 4 soil available potassium distribution in potato root zone soil available nutrient content is closely related to crop growth and crop fertilizer utilization lu 2011 wei et al 2010 found that in the state of water deficit more soil fertilizers were lost due to volatilization when the soil water supply was sufficient fertilizer volatilization was reduced and plants grow vigorously which in turn absorbed more nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from the soil similar to this we found that when the soil moisture was sufficient w2 w3 the potassium absorbed by plants from the soil increased table 2 however the potassium residue under high potassium k3 was largest indicating that too much potassium fertilizer application did not cause plants to absorb excess potassium and potato plants had limited absorption of potassium fertilizer this was consistent with the results of tan et al 2007 and zhang et al 2017a the reason may be that the combined application of potassium fertilizer on the basis of nitrogen and phosphorus can slow down potassium depletion and maintain potassium balance sun et al 2012 at the same time the content of available potassium below 60 cm was lowest in the entire vertical direction and there was no peak value this was possibly due to that the sandy soil below 60 cm was difficult to retain water and fertilizer and eventually promoted the vertical and horizontal migration of available potassium as shown in fig 6 and fig 2a the layer of below soil surface 60 100 cm had lowest potassium accumulation the maximum peak of available potassium had a downward trend with the increase of irrigation amount which was consistent with the result of wang et al 2021a 2021b high fertilizer treatments can achieve high yields while increasing the risk of nutrient residue and loss which was detrimental to environmental benefits 4 5 correlation between tuber yield and other indicators studies have shown that the dry matter was related to the content of starch protein and mineral compounds in potatoes neshev and manolov 2015 this study found that the total dry matter weight had a positive correlation with leaf area index r2 0 58 chlorophyll content r2 0 82 starch content r2 0 84 tuber yield r2 0 84 water consumption r2 0 81 and potassium accumulation r2 0 87 fig 8 these positive correlations indicated that the effects of reasonable irrigation and potassium fertilizer made the plant absorb more potassium and water which promoted root growth and the chlorophyll content would increase to get more sunlight accumulate more light contracted substances and aboveground dry matter weight and at the same time transport more assimilated substances to obtain greater yield and greater accumulation of starch content singh 2020 basically the correlation between plant growth and yield and the amount of water received suggested that the more water applied the better the potato performed wagg et al 2021 similarly potassium application would change the dry matter content of tubers reduce the content of reducing sugars and total phenols thereby improving quality parameters sarkaria et al 2020 this study found a negative correlation between the dry matter and reducing sugar content r2 0 58 this may be due to the potential effect of potassium to reduce the reducing sugar content of potato tubers by activating starch synthesis noor 2010 4 6 binary quadratic regression model farmers pursue higher economic benefits but lack of precise irrigation and fertilizer management models low water and fertilizer input is not conducive to high yield so farmers think that increasing irrigation and fertilizer level is an important way to reduce the risk of production wang et al 2019 however over irrigation and the abuse of fertilizer not only reduced the water productivity but also wasted fertilizer resources and cause soil structure degradation yan et al 2021 high irrigation water productivity wpi is the key to sustainable development of agriculture in water deficient areas the potassium absorption and accumulation of plants reflects the ability level of using potassium fertilizer starch as the main quality index of potato is closely related to the nutritional and edible value of potato irrigation amount and potassium rate were the main environmental factors limiting yield and quality in this study therefore the objective of this study was use binary quadratic regression model bqrm to explore best intervals of water and potassium input to ensure water and fertilizer conservation while maintaining high yield quality water productivity and plant k accumulation the three dimensional relationship among yield wpi starch content and potassium accumulation with total water input and potassium rate was constructed by the bqrm wang et al 2018b zou et al 2020 yan et al 2021 the range of total water input irrigation plus effective rainfall suitable for local high yield quality wpi and plant potassium accumulation was 498 520 mm and the range of potassium rate was 201 393 kg ha 1 5 conclusions irrigation amount and potassium rate significantly affected the growth yield and quality of potato and had interaction effects on chlorophyll content aboveground dry matter yield reducing sugar plant potassium accumulation and potassium use efficiency in all water and potassium combinations w3k2 treatment obtained the maximum yield and potassium accumulation in the two years compared with w3k3 w3k2 had less potassium residue and greater crop water productivity which was recommended as the optimal irrigation and fertilization combination to ensure high yield high quality water saving and fertilizer saving potato production an water input irrigation plusand effective rainfall range of 498 520 mm combined with a potassium rate of 201 393 ha 1 was recommended to maintain 95 maximum values of tuber yield quality and plant potassium accumulation and 70 maximum value of wpi simultaneously the results of this study are of great
