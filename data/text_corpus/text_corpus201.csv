1005,landscape restoration refers to the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded damaged or destroyed it has become an important theme of recent scientific and policy work despite the myriads positive impacts of restoration practices in developing countries there are also numbers of socio economic technical as well as governance limitations that need to be addressed innovatively this research synthesizes the top ten limitations that indicate inadequacy of the existing water resources management practices to enhance ecosystem sustainability potential in parallel the research advocates and demonstrates the pressing need of ecohydrology as a scientific paradigm the identified limitations comprise 1 underutilized role of dual regulation between biota and hydrology 2 the significant size of scarce productive lands that are forced to be out of production due to sizes of the physical land management technologies 3 tendencies to over engineer the environment 4 less focus on water and nutrient cycle regulation 5 tendency of considering the biological measures as a mere stabilizers of the physical measures instead of its opportunity for dual regulation which is one of the ecohydrologic principles 6 failure to target multiple ecosystem services as outcomes 7 failure to provide immediate benefits to the farmers 8 recommending passive restoration of extremely degraded landscapes which actually need ecologically assisted 9 the need of climate smartness of landscape restoration practices and 10 tendency to be sectoral instead of systemically operating the research also demonstrated that ecohydrologic strategy can address these gaps through its low cost and high impact practices keywords landscape restoration land management

as one of the key ecological issues of the twenty first century sivakumar 2007 landscape degradation directly affects 1 5 billion people globally many of which live in extreme poverty agostini and purdie 2017 with more severity in africa where it has threatened 46 of the continent wmo 2005 and expected to worsen iucn 2017 such continuously pressing environmental problems underscore the need for a systemic understanding of environmental and social problems and the creation of adaptive management and policy solutions west et al 2014 the restoration of ecological and landscape function has become an important theme of recent scientific and policy work haines young et al 2006 it is not simply planting trees chazdon and brancalion 2019 baig et al 2017 but generally refers to the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded damaged or destroyed ser 2004 and plays a central role in the provision of ecosystem services and realization of the un s sustainable development goals yirdaw et al 2017 it is more than land restoration sola et al 2020 and usually targets the reparation of ecosystem processes productivity and services without necessarily achieving a return to pre disturbance conditions mansourian 2005 cbd 2012 restoration is conceived as a triple win solution to regain ecological integrity enhance human well being and resilience to climate change pfund and stadtmüller 2005 quintessential for the conservation of the threatened and unique biodiversity yirdaw et al 2017 and also a priority for combating desertification and land degradation and limiting the impacts of anthropogenic climate change aronson and alexander 2013 restoration projects differ in their objectives and their methods of achieving those goals vaughn et al 2010 such as restoration against fire suppression baker 1994 d antonio et al 2002 restoration of disturbed arid landscapes allen 1989 and semiarid landscapes ludwig and tongway 1996 restoration to compensate

wetlands van der peijl and verhoeven 2000 restoration and sustainable development of mining areas lei et al 2016 and many others most of these interventions take too long cost too much and produce too few benefits to justify public or private expenditures verdone and seidl 2017 however the concept of providing multiple ecosystems from landscape restoration activities is gaining momentum these days yet we still lack much of the knowledge needed to operationalize and implement restoration successfully while also addressing the needs and aspirations of landholders chazdon et al 2015 the positive impacts of some of the landscape restoration practices such as the conventional soil and water conservation measures have been reported in improving soil physico chemical properties mekuria et al 2006 in reducing soil loss taye et al 2013 in reducing sediment yield haregeweyn et al 2006 in conserving soil moisture haregeweyn et al 2012 vancampenhout et al 2006 in improving crop growth and yield teklu et al 2018 in regenerating vegetation and soil build up descheemaeker et al 2006 in providing fodder yield kebede 2015 and farmers income amede 2003 and so forth however despite millions of dollars invested in watershed management and landscape restoration in developing countries the land degradation problems are still increasing osman and sauerborn 2001 that poses sustainability questions on the conventional approach in ethiopia for instance most of the conservation measures were partially or fully removed after some time for instance after the government changed in 1991 shiferaw and holden 1998 it is against the above background that this paper traced out the underpinning reasons to turn the wheel into ecohydrologic strategy for landscape restoration the project site lake hawassa sub watershed of ethiopian rift valley basin has mean annual rainfall representing water supply 959 mm and mean annual potential evapotranspiration representing water demand 1446 mm rvlbo 2020 give rise to an aridity value of 0 65 lying at the verge of dry sub humid environment category and can technically be considered as dry land water limited area 2 methodology 2 1 description of the field trial sites 2 1 1 geographic location lake hawassa sub basin is located in the central northeast of the ethiopian rift valley basin figure 1 and covers an area of 143 651 ha it contains five sub watersheds dorebafena shamena wedesa kerama tikur wuha lalima wendo kosha and shashemene toga geographically the watershed is situated between 60 45 n and 70 15 n latitude and 380 15 e and 380 45 e longitude figure 1 the sub basin straddles across two regions two zones and 12 districts overall 71 of the sub basin lies in sidama regional state and 22 lies within the oromiya regional state administrative boundary areas the balance 7 is lake hawassa which falls in both regions 2 1 2 climate the area is characterised by three main seasons the long rainy season in the summer from june september known locally as kiremt and is primarily controlled by the seasonal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the kiremt rain represents 50 70 of the mean annual total the dry period or baga extends between october and february when the itcz lies to the south of ethiopia during march and may the small rain season or the belg occurs when about 20 30 of the annual rainfall falls the mean annual rainfall in the hawassa sub basin ranges between 950 and 1 400 mm with that for hawassa city being 959 mm the western part of the sub basin receives the least rainfall rising to 1 400 mm in the eastern highlands the temperature is relatively constant throughout the year in hawassa with an average temperature of 18 5 c the daily maximum range is from 19 c to 21 c and the daily minimum temperature between 13 c and 17 c mowr 2010 2 1 3 topography and soils the majority of the sub basin area is flat to gently undulating but bounded by steep escarpments the altitude ranges from 1 680m at the lake surface to 2 700m on the eastern escarpment an altitude range of 1 020m most slopes 56 are flat to gentle 0 8 with a further 33 moderately sloping 8 30 and only 5 steep to very steep land 30 the vegetation growing period lasts 120 180 days in the west and 180 300 days in the eastern highlands four major soil types have been identified andosols 10 of the sub basin cambisols 54 luvisols 27 and leptosols 2 with nitisols and regosols occurring in association with these soils mowr 2010 2 1 4 farming and cropping system rainfed agriculture is the predominant type of agriculture in the sub basin with most farmers practicing double cropping production and benefiting from the bi modal rainfall regime of the basin the period from march to may is the short rainy period whereas the long rainy period lasts from june to november there are three major farming systems enset false banana based mixed farming lowland cereals mixed farming and commercial farming mixed farming in this example implies that cattle are to varying extent integrated into the crop production system out of the total area of the sub basin 87 has been categorised into farming systems the remainder being lake seasonal and permanent marshland and urban areas mowr 2010 this signifies a substantial expansion of farming systems as land used for cultivation and agroforestry was estimated at approximately 25 of the land area in 1972 degife 2019 2 1 5 population an older estimate of mowr 2010 shows that parts of the sub basin are relatively urbanized with 9 urban areas occurring within the sub basin although only two units have populations greater than 10 000 hawassa at 158 275 and chuko in the wendo genet wereda at 14 600 population density urban and rural for the whole sub basin is very high at 624 people per km2 total rift valley lakes basin rvlb average 167 people km2 the rural population density is much lower at 365 people km2in the west and 517 people km2 in the east hawassa city is one of the fastest growing cities in ethiopia at an estimated 4 per annum resulting in high demand for building materials and local energy sources such as charcoal 2 2 research methods a combination of primary data meta analysis systematic review interviews focus group discussion field visits and consultation of the stakeholders was employed to identify some of the key gaps of the current practices of landscape management correspondingly field demonstrations and conceptual designs were conducted to show the practicability of the strategy 3 findings of the current gaps of the existing practices in managing landscapes 3 1 reason 1 underutilized role of dual regulation between biota and hydrology every strategy for success including water resources sustainable management has to contain both elimination of threats and amplification of opportunities zalewski 2006 and one of the natural opportunities to maximize in water limited environments is the particularly tightly coupling between ecological and hydrological processes wilcox et al 2003 through self reinforcing mechanism ludwig et al 2000 in which water redistributed via processes such as interception stemflow infiltration percolation evaporation and runoff determines vegetation patterns and vice versa ludwig et al 1997 valentin et al 1999 simply put changes in one bring about changes in the others and there are multiple ways that this linkage can be achieved newman 2006 this pivot is the central interest asbjornsen et al 2011 and one of the fundamental concerns forouzeh and sharafatmandrad 2012 of ecohydrology this transdisciplinary science has developed rapidly in the past two decades in response to watershed ecological degradation amid environmental changes worldwide asbjornsen et al 2011 here ecohydrology can offer a scientific basis for designing more holistic and integrative approaches at the interface between hydrology and ecosystem science wagener et al 2010 wilcox 2010 it usually uses these feedbacks as a management tool in order to enhance quality of ecosystem which represents a desired endpoint of environmental management costanza and mageau 1999 a central tenant of ecohydrology is that the water budget and vegetation patterns and dynamics are tightly interrelated in water limited ecosystems noy meir 1973 rodrı guez iturbe 2000 ludwig et al 2005 urgeghe et al 2010 where soil moisture is the limiting factor nemani et al 2003 newman et al 2006 and resource availability is driven by water noy meir 1973 meaning soil moisture is a fundamental constraint of most ecohydrological processes and in particular of ecosystem metabolism in water limited regions noy meir 1973 it is also a key ecohydrological variable in the soil plant atmosphere systems and its status and distribution affects ecohydrological processes such as runoff infiltration and evaporation and plant morphology and function e g transpiration and photosynthetic rate wang et al 2019 all definitions of ecosystem quality and integrity advocate that soil water nutrients and organic matters collectively called resources should not be lost from the system noon 2003 once lost ecosystem recovery is more challenging in water limited ecosystem constantini et al 2016 and slower than moist areas yirdaw et al 2017 this knowledge is crucial if we are to effectively address the landscape degradation problem wilcox et al 2003 and creating this understanding to solve these practical problems is the central interest to the field of ecohydrology asbjornsen et al 2011 ecohydrological solutions will work towards regulating water dynamics and their consequences e g erosion and accelerated nutrient transfer across landscape gradients zalewski 2002 in demonstrating the above concept in practice we apparently switch the design strategy to be governed by combination of the three principles of ecohydrology the new approach fundamentally focuses on the local control of overland flows which is occasionally referred to as sheet flow kampf and mirus 2013 fig 2 contrast between resources conserving versus leaky hillsides here resource conserving landscapes are those where overland flow pathways are short and flow re infiltrates into storage zones located near the original site of overland flow generation non conserving landscapes on the other hand are those where overland flow travels farther downslope before infiltrating into a storage zone loss refers to overland flow leaving the hillslope domain wilcox et al 2003 essentially it is the overland flow in watersheds that is responsible for the occurrence of various environmental problems including flood formation erosion and the transportation of sediment loewen and pinheiro 2017 here we renovated ecological engineering measures using low cost and high impact wooden barriers to regulate the overland flow figure 3 and 4 in degraded and water limited environments plant growth is often controlled by stochastic pulses of water that directly affect plants ability to adapt and survive schwinning and sala 2004 the amount of biologically available water is arguably the central driver of many plant and microbial processes in water limited environments newman et al 2006 the distribution growth and mortality of vegetation are more sensitive to the hydrologic cycle than to any other factor including nutrients and sunlight weltzin and tissue 2003 once vegetation is degraded this positive feedback is destabilized causing a shift to a non vegetated state cook et al 2009 konings et al 2011 as shown in figures 3 and 4 the establishment of vegetation nevertheless is possible when combined with engineering structures or ecological engineering techniques stokes et al 2014 that entails design of sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both mitsch and jørgensen 2004 theoretically the purpose of soil conservation is to ensure that the rate of soil formation is not exceeded by the rate of soil loss morgan 2005 however in designing the proposed sustainable ecosystem figure 3 we begin with the type of flow that runs off the top of hill slopes and first forms thin sheets of water and cover nearly all the ground in what is termed sheet flow or overland flow shroder 2016 it is infiltration excess and initial phase of surface runoff emmett 1970 and develops after water ponded on the land surface rises high enough that it can begin to flow downslope kampf and mirus 2013 and potentially produces sheet erosion this approach ensures that the amount of water seeping into the soil is maximized thereby slowing down and reducing the amount of water running off sustainet 2010 basically the concept of ecosystem quality and integrity as well as landscape functionality advocate conservation and use of soil water nutrients and organic matters collectively called resources within a landscape system tongway and hindley 2004 tongway and ludwig 2010 noon 2003 similarly we renovated those conventional check dam structures to provide addition water run off regulating functions sediment trapping functions moisture conserving functions and provision of suitable site for plantation at the head bed and sides of gullies figure 5 3 2 reason 2 significant size of scarce productive lands are occupied and becoming out of production due to the physical land management technologies land degradation is a major cause for poverty in rural areas of sub saharan africa mesfin et al 2018 as well as africa in general where 50 of the total erosion affected people are concentrated fao 2002 it caused reduction of soil fertility and crop yield amare et al 2013 and challenging the economic and social well being of the current and future generations keno and suryabhagavan 2014 haregeweyn et al 2012 in order to curb the effects of land degradation in ethiopia the government has been taking serious measures wordofa et al 2020 such as expanding soil and water conservation practices throughout the country adimassu et al 2012 despite this effort the farmers were not enthusiastic enough in widely accepting the technologies wood 1990 the commonly mentioned reasons for this low adoption of the technologies are linked to the socio economic and governance issues of the planning and implementation of the interventions asfaw and neka 2017 asnake et al 2018 kirubel and gebreyesus 2011 however the technical design issue of the physical structures has been significantly affecting the level of adoption of the technologies paradoxically depending on slope for a slope category from 5 to greater than 55 and soil stability grass strips occupy 1 15 bench terraces occupy 5 42 and fanya juu occupy 8 40 of cultivable land areas tenge et al 2005 in ethiopia it was recommended that fanya juu terraces occupies 2 15 of the land area for a slope of 3 15 stone bunds occupy 5 25 for a slope of 5 50 and soil bunds occupy 2 20 for a slope of 3 30 teshome et al 2013 vancampenhout et al 2006 estimated that stone bunds occupy about 8 of the farmland in northern ethiopia in experimental plots established in the central highlands of ethiopia soil bunds occupy 8 6 of cultivable land adimassu et al 2012 in confirming the paradoxic impact of some of the conventional land management practices a recent report of biratu et al 2021 showed that soil bund and fanyaa juu reduced the grain yield on average by 24 and 22 respectively and they reduced off site erosion at the expense of poor farmers who can ill afford any additional costs farmers are very curious about the yield effect of the technology since the structures take up productive land and maintenance is often labour intensive and costly shiferaw and holden 1998 in this line it is evident that farmers with larger farm size can afford retaining structures compared to those with relatively lower farm size berhanu and meseret 2013 to truly achieve such win win outcomes much more attention to the interactions between swc technologies and production factors such as land labor and weather endowments is needed kassie et al 2008 3 3 reason 3 the existing technologies over engineer the environment and become less appealing for the community the conventional hydrotechnical solutions such as masonry retaining walls gabion wire mesh checkdams etc have been constructed along and across the gully network with little success high cost and addressing only short term and single goals naiman et al 1995 in the eyes of sustainability it is apparently concluded that it is impossible to eliminate the ever intensively occurring threats such as floods ryszkowski and kedziora 1999 with hydrotechnical measures alone zalewski 2014 in many situations this mechanistic approach has led to overengineering of the environment which seriously reduces the role of ecological processes in moderating the water cycle zalewski 2002 it is now apparent that engineers who in fact become real decision makers in environmental management zalewski 2014 shall understand that the water resources at the basin scale are the result not only of climatic conditions and geomorphology structures but also to a great extent of biological evolution and succession zalewski 2002 3 4 reason 4 water and nutrient cycle regulation is rarely targeted in the conventional land management practices water should be a strategic resource liu et al 2010 in watershed management it is the primary factor for sustainable development eradication of poverty and reversal of ecosystem degradation zalewski 2010 that limits and regulates the ability of the ecosystems to accumulate carbon nitrogen and phosphorus zalewski 2015 the most important natural resource tidwell 2016 and medium for all ecological processes zalewski 2003 the most fundamental driver for ecological processes chapin et al 2002 and the essential reactant catalyst or medium for many biogeochemical reactions wang et al 2015 the primary factor to reverse ecosystem degradation and major driver of biogeochemical evolution and hence of biodiversity and bioproductivity millenium 2005 zalewski 2015 a central organizer of ecosystems and for eradication of poverty zalewski 2010 tidwell 2016 a key aspect of sustainability challenges facing humans in the anthropocene silvapalan et al 2014 maass et al 1962 falkenmark and rockström 2004 the only factor linking all ecosystem services krauze and wagner 2008 the most critical factor to achieve sustainable development zalewski 2002 and fundamental for all forms of life and most human activities on earth zalewski 2015 it also works as a carrier of solutes plays a key role in local climate regulation and sets the ecohydrological conditions for biological diversity in any habitat rockström et al 1999 in this regard our renovated ecological engineering system figure 6 targets creation of runoff runon system ludwig 2005 system which is named by different authors as source sink system asbjornsen et al 2011 patch intepatch system ludwig et al 1997 hillslope patch tongway and hindley 2009 divergent and convergent areas belnap et al 2005 bare slope and vegetated slope belnap et al 2005 fertile patches and water shedding interpatches alchin 2011 or the source area for generating runoff and the sink area for capturing run on urgeghe et al 2010 these two basic units of the landscape are meant to create spatial niches for biota growth and designed to function in way that runoff redistribution from bare to vegetated patches concentrates the critical resources of water sediment nutrients and organic matters which can then enhance vegetation growth and biomass 3 5 reason 5 the biological measures are considered as stabilizers of the physical measures not as dual regulators as in the case of ecohydrology in the conventional watershed management system biological measures of soil and water conservation are thought to enhance efficiency of soil erosion protection by stabilizing the physical structures amare et al 2014 as shown in figures 3 and 4 the anticipated low cost and high impact ecological engineering the third principle of ecohydrology has been established which can be considered as a modified form of contour bunds to regulate the surface runoff the first principle of ecohydrology following the physical structure selected grass varieties are planted with an intention to overtake the role of the physical structure over time at establishment stage the vegetation benefits from the physical structure by gaining the required moisture nutrients fertile soils deposited as sediment and organic matters once established the vegetation will in turn regulate the runoff flow the second principle of ecohydrology this dual regulation mechanism is the basic essence of ecohydrology 3 6 reason 6 land management practices shall derive multiple ecosystem services es as outcomes for better adoption by farmers in practice ecohydrological processes are closely connected to many water related ecosystem services including climate moderation water supply and quality and flood mitigation ellison et al 2012 jackson et al 2009 sun et al 2015 ecosystem services that are potentially derived from restoration efforts are those benefits that are directly enjoyed consumed or used to yield human wellbeing boyd and banzhaf 2006 and can be either intermediate or final services fisher et al 2009 us epa 2009 de groot et al 2010 tallis and polasky 2011 for instance intermediate ecosystem services can be the ecological and hydrological processes and the final services refers to aspects of the environment that have direct value to society boyd and banzhaf 2007 fisher et al 2009 ringold et al 2013 the ecosystem services approach refers to the interdependencies between nature and human well being schleyer et al 2017 steger et al 2018 they are increasingly used as a framework worldwide for the purposes of ecological restoration and conservation wei et al 2017 watershed management falkenmark et al 2004 and sustainable development policy making asbjornsen et al 2015 while applying the concept of regulating the hydrology in non agricultural lands such as highly degraded landscapes as shown in figure 7 below we may derive multiple ecosystem services while demonstrating the concept of chain of ecosystem services we constructed the renovated physical structure that provide immediate function to store water during the rains and fulfills the functional expectations of water harvesting and conservation measures es 1 through which climate moderation es 2 flood control es 3 and drought management es 4 benefits are to be obtained that in turn promote groundwater recharge fluxes towards aquifers es 5 such hydrological regulations will result in erosion control es 6 and sediment reduction into the lake es 7 through which water purification es 8 will take place however disaggregating the functioning of ecosystems into discrete services is philosophically as well as practically difficult however the discretization is just for the sake of communication on the project outcomes and also to design indicators of success while monitoring successes as a result of the above regulating services the landscape ensures availability of soil moisture hydrologic process 3 which is a physical soil state variable that is defined as the water contained in the unsaturated soil zone and a key variable in many hydrological climatological environmental and ecohydrological processes the soil moisture green water management drives the fixation of dinitrogen n2 by microbial symbionts of plants as well as microbial mineralization of soil organic matter with this the landscape will be capable of water cycling es 9 and support nutrient cycling es 10 by which the landscape provides habitat for fauna and flora es 11 due to changes in vegetation and canopy density and decomposition rates will be enhanced through proper delivery of the above services the ecosystem will provide improved biodiversity and products such fruit trees grasses to the community es 12 that will also enable the landscape to sequestrate carbon es 13 and improved soil fertility es 14 as a result of better nutrient and water cycling while the above services satisfy environmental and social benefits to the community the new employment opportunities es 15 derived from these services contributes to the livelihood and food security aspect of the community which is a critical aspect for sustainability 3 7 reason 7 the importance of gaining immediate benefits for the farmers the subsistence farmer cannot afford to respond to philosophical or emotional appeals to care for the soil and this means that conservation measures must have visible short term benefits to the farmer fao 1987 tilahun and belay 2019 dialla 1992 acknowledged that third world farmers are very responsive to immediate observable outcomes rather than to uncertain long term benefits in this action research the ecological engineering interventions are meant to provide multiple ecosystem services among which some deliver immediate benefits to the farmers eg grasses for cattle protecting the community from flood problems etc 3 8 reason 8 highly degraded and dysfunctioning landscapes are perceived to rehabilitated by itself passively conceptual confusion seems to revolve around management of degraded and dysfunctioning landscapes such landscapes figures 6 and 7 crossed the state where their capacity for regeneration is greatly reduced or lost recovery is arrested core interactions and feedbacks are broken and human intervention is required to initiate a trajectory of recovery ghazoul and chazdon 2017 3 9 reason 9 necessity of climate smart landscape management approach climate change is a new reality to the conventional watershed management practices the impacts of climate change are now inevitable and are expected to affect people in african countries the most joyce et al 2006 it is a major concern to the sustainability of water resources and ecosystems ipcc 1996 as a component of this big picture some initiatives such as climate smart of agriculture targets re orientation of the conventional system to support food security under the new realities of climate change lipper et al 2014 by the same token the conventional watershed management practices need to customize themselves to the ever strengthening climate related phenomena like extreme flood figure 8 and drought by climate smart landscape we are referring a landscape that simultaneously supports climate development and conservation objectives kusters 2015 which has been emerged in parallel to development of the climate smart discourse within the agricultural development and conservation communities scherr et al 2012 natural resource base sustainability refers to the ability of a system to maintain productivity when subject to disturbing forces stresses and shocks joyce et al 2006 as indicated in the multi functionality of the proposed system reason 6 climate change regulation is one the ecosystem services to be offered by restoring the landscape we are providing two key management approaches to mitigate the effects of climate change sequestering carbon through the establishment of green biomass and the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services ser 2019 lindenmayer et al 2002 reported that landscape scale restoration approaches are likely key for arresting and mitigating negative effects of climate change ecohydrological processes are also closely connected to many water related ecosystem services including climate moderation water supply and quality and flood mitigation ellison et al 2012 jackson et al 2008 sun et al 2015 3 10 reason 10 necessity of systemic approach a systems approach must be used to identify and solve interrelated problems of a watershed watson et al 1999 on one hand as shown in figures 9 ecological restoration is set to be the major target of the intervention for it is becoming the central component of modern conservation paradigms hobbs and harris 2001 suding 2011 on the other hand ecohydrology which brings together concepts methods and disciplinary knowledge from ecology and hydrology wassen 2007 is adopted as a strategy the concept of green infrastructure is also adopted as an approach planning framework green infrastructure gi is a strategically planned network of natural and semi natural features that are designed or managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services estreguil et al 2019 and in our case it refers to the renovated ecological engineering measures that are able to capture retain remediate and slowly release water that might otherwise have passed rapidly through an area padowski 2019 4 conclusion and recommendation it is concluded that the contemporary landscape management practices in developing countries are not sufficient to guarantee sustainable development and need to be renovated these gaps potentially create broken or loose connections along the result chain of the road to sustainability the essence of recognizing the prevailing gaps in land management practices in developing countries is to devise a better strategy so as to align with the un sustainable development goals in this regard the result of this research nominated ecohydrology as a sustainable science however the application of dryland ecohydrology to solve practical problems of landscape degradation is not well developed as compared to the wet land ecosystem this condition is expected to trigger future explorations so that the value of ecohydrology concept is reflected more declaration of competing interest no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors acknowledgement the author acknowledges hawassa university thematic research project support upon which this paper draws 
1005,landscape restoration refers to the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded damaged or destroyed it has become an important theme of recent scientific and policy work despite the myriads positive impacts of restoration practices in developing countries there are also numbers of socio economic technical as well as governance limitations that need to be addressed innovatively this research synthesizes the top ten limitations that indicate inadequacy of the existing water resources management practices to enhance ecosystem sustainability potential in parallel the research advocates and demonstrates the pressing need of ecohydrology as a scientific paradigm the identified limitations comprise 1 underutilized role of dual regulation between biota and hydrology 2 the significant size of scarce productive lands that are forced to be out of production due to sizes of the physical land management technologies 3 tendencies to over engineer the

of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded damaged or destroyed ser 2004 and plays a central role in the provision of ecosystem services and realization of the un s sustainable development goals yirdaw et al 2017 it is more than land restoration sola et al 2020 and usually targets the reparation of ecosystem processes productivity and services without necessarily achieving a return to pre disturbance conditions mansourian 2005 cbd 2012 restoration is conceived as a triple win solution to regain ecological integrity enhance human well being and resilience to climate change pfund and stadtmüller 2005 quintessential for the conservation of the threatened and unique biodiversity yirdaw et al 2017 and also a priority for combating desertification and land degradation and limiting the impacts of anthropogenic climate change aronson and alexander 2013 restoration projects differ in their objectives and their methods of achieving those goals vaughn et al 2010 such as restoration against fire suppression baker 1994 d antonio et al 2002 restoration of disturbed arid landscapes allen 1989 and semiarid landscapes ludwig and tongway 1996 restoration to compensate deforestation haggar et al 1997 reclaiming coal surface mines holl and cairns 1994 native grassland restoration knapp and rice 1996 river restoration koebel 1995 nolan and guthrie 1998 retention of nutrients in river basins kronvang et al 1999 restoration of an inbred adder population madsen et al 1999 compensating for wetland losses nrc 2001 restoration of disturbed ecosystems palik et al 2000 restoring habitats schultz and crone 1998 restoration of abandoned rangeland scowcroft and jeffrey 1999 conservation by restoration tockner et al 1998 carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in wetlands van der peijl and verhoeven 2000 restoration and sustainable development of mining areas lei et al 2016 and many others most of these interventions take too long cost too much and produce too few benefits to justify public or private expenditures verdone and seidl 2017 however the concept of providing multiple ecosystems from landscape restoration activities is gaining momentum these days yet we still lack much of the knowledge needed to operationalize and implement restoration successfully while also addressing the needs and aspirations of landholders chazdon et al 2015 the positive impacts of some of the landscape restoration practices such as the conventional soil and water conservation measures have been reported in improving soil physico chemical properties mekuria et al 2006 in reducing soil loss taye et al 2013 in reducing sediment yield haregeweyn et al 2006 in conserving soil moisture haregeweyn et al 2012 vancampenhout et al 2006 in improving crop growth and yield teklu et al 2018 in regenerating vegetation and soil build up descheemaeker et al 2006 in providing fodder yield kebede 2015 and farmers income amede 2003 and so forth however despite millions of dollars invested in watershed management and landscape restoration in developing countries the land degradation problems are still increasing osman and sauerborn 2001 that poses sustainability questions on the conventional approach in ethiopia for instance most of the conservation measures were partially or fully removed after some time for instance after the government changed in 1991 shiferaw and holden 1998 it is against the above background that this paper traced out the underpinning reasons to turn the wheel into ecohydrologic strategy for landscape restoration the project site lake hawassa sub watershed of ethiopian rift valley basin has mean annual rainfall representing water supply 959 mm and mean annual potential evapotranspiration representing water demand 1446 mm rvlbo 2020 give rise to an aridity value of 0 65 lying at the verge of dry sub humid environment category and can technically be considered as dry land water limited area 2 methodology 2 1 description of the field trial sites 2 1 1 geographic location lake hawassa sub basin is located in the central northeast of the ethiopian rift valley basin figure 1 and covers an area of 143 651 ha it contains five sub watersheds dorebafena shamena wedesa kerama tikur wuha lalima wendo kosha and shashemene toga geographically the watershed is situated between 60 45 n and 70 15 n latitude and 380 15 e and 380 45 e longitude figure 1 the sub basin straddles across two regions two zones and 12 districts overall 71 of the sub basin lies in sidama regional state and 22 lies within the oromiya regional state administrative boundary areas the balance 7 is lake hawassa which falls in both regions 2 1 2 climate the area is characterised by three main seasons the long rainy season in the summer from june september known locally as kiremt and is primarily controlled by the seasonal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz the kiremt rain represents 50 70 of the mean annual total the dry period or baga extends between october and february when the itcz lies to the south of ethiopia during march and may the small rain season or the belg occurs when about 20 30 of the annual rainfall falls the mean annual rainfall in the hawassa sub basin ranges between 950 and 1 400 mm with that for hawassa city being 959 mm the western part of the sub basin receives the least rainfall rising to 1 400 mm in the eastern highlands the temperature is relatively constant throughout the year in hawassa with an average temperature of 18 5 c the daily maximum range is from 19 c to 21 c and the daily minimum temperature between 13 c and 17 c mowr 2010 2 1 3 topography and soils the majority of the sub basin area is flat to gently undulating but bounded by steep escarpments the altitude ranges from 1 680m at the lake surface to 2 700m on the eastern escarpment an altitude range of 1 020m most slopes 56 are flat to gentle 0 8 with a further 33 moderately sloping 8 30 and only 5 steep to very steep land 30 the vegetation growing period lasts 120 180 days in the west and 180 300 days in the eastern highlands four major soil types have been identified andosols 10 of the sub basin cambisols 54 luvisols 27 and leptosols 2 with nitisols and regosols occurring in association with these soils mowr 2010 2 1 4 farming and cropping system rainfed agriculture is the predominant type of agriculture in the sub basin with most farmers practicing double cropping production and benefiting from the bi modal rainfall regime of the basin the period from march to may is the short rainy period whereas the long rainy period lasts from june to november there are three major farming systems enset false banana based mixed farming lowland cereals mixed farming and commercial farming mixed farming in this example implies that cattle are to varying extent integrated into the crop production system out of the total area of the sub basin 87 has been categorised into farming systems the remainder being lake seasonal and permanent marshland and urban areas mowr 2010 this signifies a substantial expansion of farming systems as land used for cultivation and agroforestry was estimated at approximately 25 of the land area in 1972 degife 2019 2 1 5 population an older estimate of mowr 2010 shows that parts of the sub basin are relatively urbanized with 9 urban areas occurring within the sub basin although only two units have populations greater than 10 000 hawassa at 158 275 and chuko in the wendo genet wereda at 14 600 population density urban and rural for the whole sub basin is very high at 624 people per km2 total rift valley lakes basin rvlb average 167 people km2 the rural population density is much lower at 365 people km2in the west and 517 people km2 in the east hawassa city is one of the fastest growing cities in ethiopia at an estimated 4 per annum resulting in high demand for building materials and local energy sources such as charcoal 2 2 research methods a combination of primary data meta analysis systematic review interviews focus group discussion field visits and consultation of the stakeholders was employed to identify some of the key gaps of the current practices of landscape management correspondingly field demonstrations and conceptual designs were conducted to show the practicability of the strategy 3 findings of the current gaps of the existing practices in managing landscapes 3 1 reason 1 underutilized role of dual regulation between biota and hydrology every strategy for success including water resources sustainable management has to contain both elimination of threats and amplification of opportunities zalewski 2006 and one of the natural opportunities to maximize in water limited environments is the particularly tightly coupling between ecological and hydrological processes wilcox et al 2003 through self reinforcing mechanism ludwig et al 2000 in which water redistributed via processes such as interception stemflow infiltration percolation evaporation and runoff determines vegetation patterns and vice versa ludwig et al 1997 valentin et al 1999 simply put changes in one bring about changes in the others and there are multiple ways that this linkage can be achieved newman 2006 this pivot is the central interest asbjornsen et al 2011 and one of the fundamental concerns forouzeh and sharafatmandrad 2012 of ecohydrology this transdisciplinary science has developed rapidly in the past two decades in response to watershed ecological degradation amid environmental changes worldwide asbjornsen et al 2011 here ecohydrology can offer a scientific basis for designing more holistic and integrative approaches at the interface between hydrology and ecosystem science wagener et al 2010 wilcox 2010 it usually uses these feedbacks as a management tool in order to enhance quality of ecosystem which represents a desired endpoint of environmental management costanza and mageau 1999 a central tenant of ecohydrology is that the water budget and vegetation patterns and dynamics are tightly interrelated in water limited ecosystems noy meir 1973 rodrı guez iturbe 2000 ludwig et al 2005 urgeghe et al 2010 where soil moisture is the limiting factor nemani et al 2003 newman et al 2006 and resource availability is driven by water noy meir 1973 meaning soil moisture is a fundamental constraint of most ecohydrological processes and in particular of ecosystem metabolism in water limited regions noy meir 1973 it is also a key ecohydrological variable in the soil plant atmosphere systems and its status and distribution affects ecohydrological processes such as runoff infiltration and evaporation and plant morphology and function e g transpiration and photosynthetic rate wang et al 2019 all definitions of ecosystem quality and integrity advocate that soil water nutrients and organic matters collectively called resources should not be lost from the system noon 2003 once lost ecosystem recovery is more challenging in water limited ecosystem constantini et al 2016 and slower than moist areas yirdaw et al 2017 this knowledge is crucial if we are to effectively address the landscape degradation problem wilcox et al 2003 and creating this understanding to solve these practical problems is the central interest to the field of ecohydrology asbjornsen et al 2011 ecohydrological solutions will work towards regulating water dynamics and their consequences e g erosion and accelerated nutrient transfer across landscape gradients zalewski 2002 in demonstrating the above concept in practice we apparently switch the design strategy to be governed by combination of the three principles of ecohydrology the new approach fundamentally focuses on the local control of overland flows which is occasionally referred to as sheet flow kampf and mirus 2013 fig 2 contrast between resources conserving versus leaky hillsides here resource conserving landscapes are those where overland flow pathways are short and flow re infiltrates into storage zones located near the original site of overland flow generation non conserving landscapes on the other hand are those where overland flow travels farther downslope before infiltrating into a storage zone loss refers to overland flow leaving the hillslope domain wilcox et al 2003 essentially it is the overland flow in watersheds that is responsible for the occurrence of various environmental problems including flood formation erosion and the transportation of sediment loewen and pinheiro 2017 here we renovated ecological engineering measures using low cost and high impact wooden barriers to regulate the overland flow figure 3 and 4 in degraded and water limited environments plant growth is often controlled by stochastic pulses of water that directly affect plants ability to adapt and survive schwinning and sala 2004 the amount of biologically available water is arguably the central driver of many plant and microbial processes in water limited environments newman et al 2006 the distribution growth and mortality of vegetation are more sensitive to the hydrologic cycle than to any other factor including nutrients and sunlight weltzin and tissue 2003 once vegetation is degraded this positive feedback is destabilized causing a shift to a non vegetated state cook et al 2009 konings et al 2011 as shown in figures 3 and 4 the establishment of vegetation nevertheless is possible when combined with engineering structures or ecological engineering techniques stokes et al 2014 that entails design of sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both mitsch and jørgensen 2004 theoretically the purpose of soil conservation is to ensure that the rate of soil formation is not exceeded by the rate of soil loss morgan 2005 however in designing the proposed sustainable ecosystem figure 3 we begin with the type of flow that runs off the top of hill slopes and first forms thin sheets of water and cover nearly all the ground in what is termed sheet flow or overland flow shroder 2016 it is infiltration excess and initial phase of surface runoff emmett 1970 and develops after water ponded on the land surface rises high enough that it can begin to flow downslope kampf and mirus 2013 and potentially produces sheet erosion this approach ensures that the amount of water seeping into the soil is maximized thereby slowing down and reducing the amount of water running off sustainet 2010 basically the concept of ecosystem quality and integrity as well as landscape functionality advocate conservation and use of soil water nutrients and organic matters collectively called resources within a landscape system tongway and hindley 2004 tongway and ludwig 2010 noon 2003 similarly we renovated those conventional check dam structures to provide addition water run off regulating functions sediment trapping functions moisture conserving functions and provision of suitable site for plantation at the head bed and sides of gullies figure 5 3 2 reason 2 significant size of scarce productive lands are occupied and becoming out of production due to the physical land management technologies land degradation is a major cause for poverty in rural areas of sub saharan africa mesfin et al 2018 as well as africa in general where 50 of the total erosion affected people are concentrated fao 2002 it caused reduction of soil fertility and crop yield amare et al 2013 and challenging the economic and social well being of the current and future generations keno and suryabhagavan 2014 haregeweyn et al 2012 in order to curb the effects of land degradation in ethiopia the government has been taking serious measures wordofa et al 2020 such as expanding soil and water conservation practices throughout the country adimassu et al 2012 despite this effort the farmers were not enthusiastic enough in widely accepting the technologies wood 1990 the commonly mentioned reasons for this low adoption of the technologies are linked to the socio economic and governance issues of the planning and implementation of the interventions asfaw and neka 2017 asnake et al 2018 kirubel and gebreyesus 2011 however the technical design issue of the physical structures has been significantly affecting the level of adoption of the technologies paradoxically depending on slope for a slope category from 5 to greater than 55 and soil stability grass strips occupy 1 15 bench terraces occupy 5 42 and fanya juu occupy 8 40 of cultivable land areas tenge et al 2005 in ethiopia it was recommended that fanya juu terraces occupies 2 15 of the land area for a slope of 3 15 stone bunds occupy 5 25 for a slope of 5 50 and soil bunds occupy 2 20 for a slope of 3 30 teshome et al 2013 vancampenhout et al 2006 estimated that stone bunds occupy about 8 of the farmland in northern ethiopia in experimental plots established in the central highlands of ethiopia soil bunds occupy 8 6 of cultivable land adimassu et al 2012 in confirming the paradoxic impact of some of the conventional land management practices a recent report of biratu et al 2021 showed that soil bund and fanyaa juu reduced the grain yield on average by 24 and 22 respectively and they reduced off site erosion at the expense of poor farmers who can ill afford any additional costs farmers are very curious about the yield effect of the technology since the structures take up productive land and maintenance is often labour intensive and costly shiferaw and holden 1998 in this line it is evident that farmers with larger farm size can afford retaining structures compared to those with relatively lower farm size berhanu and meseret 2013 to truly achieve such win win outcomes much more attention to the interactions between swc technologies and production factors such as land labor and weather endowments is needed kassie et al 2008 3 3 reason 3 the existing technologies over engineer the environment and become less appealing for the community the conventional hydrotechnical solutions such as masonry retaining walls gabion wire mesh checkdams etc have been constructed along and across the gully network with little success high cost and addressing only short term and single goals naiman et al 1995 in the eyes of sustainability it is apparently concluded that it is impossible to eliminate the ever intensively occurring threats such as floods ryszkowski and kedziora 1999 with hydrotechnical measures alone zalewski 2014 in many situations this mechanistic approach has led to overengineering of the environment which seriously reduces the role of ecological processes in moderating the water cycle zalewski 2002 it is now apparent that engineers who in fact become real decision makers in environmental management zalewski 2014 shall understand that the water resources at the basin scale are the result not only of climatic conditions and geomorphology structures but also to a great extent of biological evolution and succession zalewski 2002 3 4 reason 4 water and nutrient cycle regulation is rarely targeted in the conventional land management practices water should be a strategic resource liu et al 2010 in watershed management it is the primary factor for sustainable development eradication of poverty and reversal of ecosystem degradation zalewski 2010 that limits and regulates the ability of the ecosystems to accumulate carbon nitrogen and phosphorus zalewski 2015 the most important natural resource tidwell 2016 and medium for all ecological processes zalewski 2003 the most fundamental driver for ecological processes chapin et al 2002 and the essential reactant catalyst or medium for many biogeochemical reactions wang et al 2015 the primary factor to reverse ecosystem degradation and major driver of biogeochemical evolution and hence of biodiversity and bioproductivity millenium 2005 zalewski 2015 a central organizer of ecosystems and for eradication of poverty zalewski 2010 tidwell 2016 a key aspect of sustainability challenges facing humans in the anthropocene silvapalan et al 2014 maass et al 1962 falkenmark and rockström 2004 the only factor linking all ecosystem services krauze and wagner 2008 the most critical factor to achieve sustainable development zalewski 2002 and fundamental for all forms of life and most human activities on earth zalewski 2015 it also works as a carrier of solutes plays a key role in local climate regulation and sets the ecohydrological conditions for biological diversity in any habitat rockström et al 1999 in this regard our renovated ecological engineering system figure 6 targets creation of runoff runon system ludwig 2005 system which is named by different authors as source sink system asbjornsen et al 2011 patch intepatch system ludwig et al 1997 hillslope patch tongway and hindley 2009 divergent and convergent areas belnap et al 2005 bare slope and vegetated slope belnap et al 2005 fertile patches and water shedding interpatches alchin 2011 or the source area for generating runoff and the sink area for capturing run on urgeghe et al 2010 these two basic units of the landscape are meant to create spatial niches for biota growth and designed to function in way that runoff redistribution from bare to vegetated patches concentrates the critical resources of water sediment nutrients and organic matters which can then enhance vegetation growth and biomass 3 5 reason 5 the biological measures are considered as stabilizers of the physical measures not as dual regulators as in the case of ecohydrology in the conventional watershed management system biological measures of soil and water conservation are thought to enhance efficiency of soil erosion protection by stabilizing the physical structures amare et al 2014 as shown in figures 3 and 4 the anticipated low cost and high impact ecological engineering the third principle of ecohydrology has been established which can be considered as a modified form of contour bunds to regulate the surface runoff the first principle of ecohydrology following the physical structure selected grass varieties are planted with an intention to overtake the role of the physical structure over time at establishment stage the vegetation benefits from the physical structure by gaining the required moisture nutrients fertile soils deposited as sediment and organic matters once established the vegetation will in turn regulate the runoff flow the second principle of ecohydrology this dual regulation mechanism is the basic essence of ecohydrology 3 6 reason 6 land management practices shall derive multiple ecosystem services es as outcomes for better adoption by farmers in practice ecohydrological processes are closely connected to many water related ecosystem services including climate moderation water supply and quality and flood mitigation ellison et al 2012 jackson et al 2009 sun et al 2015 ecosystem services that are potentially derived from restoration efforts are those benefits that are directly enjoyed consumed or used to yield human wellbeing boyd and banzhaf 2006 and can be either intermediate or final services fisher et al 2009 us epa 2009 de groot et al 2010 tallis and polasky 2011 for instance intermediate ecosystem services can be the ecological and hydrological processes and the final services refers to aspects of the environment that have direct value to society boyd and banzhaf 2007 fisher et al 2009 ringold et al 2013 the ecosystem services approach refers to the interdependencies between nature and human well being schleyer et al 2017 steger et al 2018 they are increasingly used as a framework worldwide for the purposes of ecological restoration and conservation wei et al 2017 watershed management falkenmark et al 2004 and sustainable development policy making asbjornsen et al 2015 while applying the concept of regulating the hydrology in non agricultural lands such as highly degraded landscapes as shown in figure 7 below we may derive multiple ecosystem services while demonstrating the concept of chain of ecosystem services we constructed the renovated physical structure that provide immediate function to store water during the rains and fulfills the functional expectations of water harvesting and conservation measures es 1 through which climate moderation es 2 flood control es 3 and drought management es 4 benefits are to be obtained that in turn promote groundwater recharge fluxes towards aquifers es 5 such hydrological regulations will result in erosion control es 6 and sediment reduction into the lake es 7 through which water purification es 8 will take place however disaggregating the functioning of ecosystems into discrete services is philosophically as well as practically difficult however the discretization is just for the sake of communication on the project outcomes and also to design indicators of success while monitoring successes as a result of the above regulating services the landscape ensures availability of soil moisture hydrologic process 3 which is a physical soil state variable that is defined as the water contained in the unsaturated soil zone and a key variable in many hydrological climatological environmental and ecohydrological processes the soil moisture green water management drives the fixation of dinitrogen n2 by microbial symbionts of plants as well as microbial mineralization of soil organic matter with this the landscape will be capable of water cycling es 9 and support nutrient cycling es 10 by which the landscape provides habitat for fauna and flora es 11 due to changes in vegetation and canopy density and decomposition rates will be enhanced through proper delivery of the above services the ecosystem will provide improved biodiversity and products such fruit trees grasses to the community es 12 that will also enable the landscape to sequestrate carbon es 13 and improved soil fertility es 14 as a result of better nutrient and water cycling while the above services satisfy environmental and social benefits to the community the new employment opportunities es 15 derived from these services contributes to the livelihood and food security aspect of the community which is a critical aspect for sustainability 3 7 reason 7 the importance of gaining immediate benefits for the farmers the subsistence farmer cannot afford to respond to philosophical or emotional appeals to care for the soil and this means that conservation measures must have visible short term benefits to the farmer fao 1987 tilahun and belay 2019 dialla 1992 acknowledged that third world farmers are very responsive to immediate observable outcomes rather than to uncertain long term benefits in this action research the ecological engineering interventions are meant to provide multiple ecosystem services among which some deliver immediate benefits to the farmers eg grasses for cattle protecting the community from flood problems etc 3 8 reason 8 highly degraded and dysfunctioning landscapes are perceived to rehabilitated by itself passively conceptual confusion seems to revolve around management of degraded and dysfunctioning landscapes such landscapes figures 6 and 7 crossed the state where their capacity for regeneration is greatly reduced or lost recovery is arrested core interactions and feedbacks are broken and human intervention is required to initiate a trajectory of recovery ghazoul and chazdon 2017 3 9 reason 9 necessity of climate smart landscape management approach climate change is a new reality to the conventional watershed management practices the impacts of climate change are now inevitable and are expected to affect people in african countries the most joyce et al 2006 it is a major concern to the sustainability of water resources and ecosystems ipcc 1996 as a component of this big picture some initiatives such as climate smart of agriculture targets re orientation of the conventional system to support food security under the new realities of climate change lipper et al 2014 by the same token the conventional watershed management practices need to customize themselves to the ever strengthening climate related phenomena like extreme flood figure 8 and drought by climate smart landscape we are referring a landscape that simultaneously supports climate development and conservation objectives kusters 2015 which has been emerged in parallel to development of the climate smart discourse within the agricultural development and conservation communities scherr et al 2012 natural resource base sustainability refers to the ability of a system to maintain productivity when subject to disturbing forces stresses and shocks joyce et al 2006 as indicated in the multi functionality of the proposed system reason 6 climate change regulation is one the ecosystem services to be offered by restoring the landscape we are providing two key management approaches to mitigate the effects of climate change sequestering carbon through the establishment of green biomass and the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services ser 2019 lindenmayer et al 2002 reported that landscape scale restoration approaches are likely key for arresting and mitigating negative effects of climate change ecohydrological processes are also closely connected to many water related ecosystem services including climate moderation water supply and quality and flood mitigation ellison et al 2012 jackson et al 2008 sun et al 2015 3 10 reason 10 necessity of systemic approach a systems approach must be used to identify and solve interrelated problems of a watershed watson et al 1999 on one hand as shown in figures 9 ecological restoration is set to be the major target of the intervention for it is becoming the central component of modern conservation paradigms hobbs and harris 2001 suding 2011 on the other hand ecohydrology which brings together concepts methods and disciplinary knowledge from ecology and hydrology wassen 2007 is adopted as a strategy the concept of green infrastructure is also adopted as an approach planning framework green infrastructure gi is a strategically planned network of natural and semi natural features that are designed or managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services estreguil et al 2019 and in our case it refers to the renovated ecological engineering measures that are able to capture retain remediate and slowly release water that might otherwise have passed rapidly through an area padowski 2019 4 conclusion and recommendation it is concluded that the contemporary landscape management practices in developing countries are not sufficient to guarantee sustainable development and need to be renovated these gaps potentially create broken or loose connections along the result chain of the road to sustainability the essence of recognizing the prevailing gaps in land management practices in developing countries is to devise a better strategy so as to align with the un sustainable development goals in this regard the result of this research nominated ecohydrology as a sustainable science however the application of dryland ecohydrology to solve practical problems of landscape degradation is not well developed as compared to the wet land ecosystem this condition is expected to trigger future explorations so that the value of ecohydrology concept is reflected more declaration of competing interest no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors acknowledgement the author acknowledges hawassa university thematic research project support upon which this paper draws 
1006,the light dark cycle seems to influence the infection pattern of cyanophages this may be related to their dependence on the photosynthetic process of their hosts cyanobacteria the present study examined the daily occurrence dynamic of microcystis with the use of the 16s rrna gene and the ma lmm01 like cyanophages with the use of the g91 gene in jeziorsko and sulejow reservoirs poland also the daily expression pattern of mentioned cyanophages gene was investigated the daily dynamic of cyanophage was mainly associated with microcystis occurrence however the g91 transcription exhibited greater activity during daylight and lowered within nighttime in both water bodies the maximum transcription was found at 4 00 pm in jeziorsko and 12 00 pm in sulejow reservoirs additionally the g91 gene fragments shared a high level of similarity with microcystis specific cyanophages ma lmm01 and mamv dc strains keywords 16s rrna microcystis cyanobacteria g91 cyanophages abbreviations g91 the sheath protein encoding gene rpob the rna polymerase subunit encoding gene 1 introduction cyanophages as cyanoporkaryota cyanobacterial viruses can directly or indirectly affect mortality the composition and the evolution of their host morimoto et al 2020 de oliveira santos 2021 it was reported that microcystis spp can be permanently loaded with viral infections yoshida et al 2010 xia et al 2013 mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 moreover cyanophages that lyse toxigenic genotypes of microcystis spp can cause the release of the toxic metabolites into the environment what might harmful for water organism and people suttle 2005 jassim and limoges 2013 chorus and welker 2021 the above mentioned process was observed in toledo ohio where microcystin contamination 1ug l 1 of drinking water was noticed after lysis of microcystis toxic strains by ma lmm01 like cyanophages in lake erie steffen et al 2017 in cases such as the above it is essential to increase the knowledge of the interactions between organisms taking into account the role of viruses and abiotic parameters the ecohydrological approach using the understanding of relationships between hydrological and biological processes in aquatic ecosystems goes out towards the above mentioned problem zalewski et al 1997 zalewski and robarts 2003 within its framework innovative system solutions are sought to prevent and counteract complex environmental threats however the first step in developing solutions based on natural processes is to understand the interactions between organisms at the molecular level zalewski 2000 zalewski and robarts 2003 our previous study has identified and monitored the cyanophages dynamics specific to microcystis spp during the summer seasons 2009 2013 in a eutrophic polish lowland reservoir mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 cyanophages from the myoviridae family have co occurred with microcystis spp and a correlation between their occurrence was observed in the mentioned study the structural gene of g91 encoding the viral sheath protein was used as a marker of cyanophages from the myoviridae family specific to cyanobacteria of the microcystis genus the sequence of the tested structural gene is considered as a marker of the viral lytic cycle and it was obtained from the genome sequence known as ma lmm01 type cyanophage which is based on genomes of ma lmm01 cyanophage and homologous to other cyanophages obtained from the freshwater sources in east asia japan mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 yoshida et al 2006 takashima et al 2007 yoshida et al 2008 stough et al 2017 the life processes of cyanobacteria as photosynthetic organisms depend on a daily cycle straub et al 2011 the photosynthesis process is indispensable for the function of cyanobacterial cells as it serves as their main source of atp and nadph as well is needed for the acquisition of organic compounds carbon dioxide and other mineral substances thomson et al 2016 according to sought et al 2017 analyzes the transcription pattern of some genes involved in the oxygenic photosynthesis process depends on the daylight due to the fact that the host derived genes have been found in cyanophages it is thought that they can use the diurnal behavior of their hosts to multiply descendant phages ni and zeng 2016 in the case of ma lmm01 like cyanophages specific to the microcystis genus the diel cycle into the natural host population was shown only in hirosawanoike pond in japan kimura et al 2012 according to available literature there is a lack of such information from other geographic locations thus the present study attempts to determine the evidence of cyanophages diurnal presence and transcriptional rhythm from two lowland reservoirs from central europe poland for better understanding cyanophage cyanobacteria dependences towards this aim we analyzed the daily occurrence dynamics of microcystis spp with the use of 16s rrna gene the ma lmm01 like cyanophages diurnal presence in the microcystis cells with the use of g91 gene and the daily relative for transcript abundance of cyanophage g91 gene within a natural host cell population during the day night summer periods in 2016 in the jeziorsko

instructed by the producer the number of transcripts and genes copies studied were analyzed by real time pcr according to the protocol mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 and nolan et al 2006 according to pinto et al 2012 the cyanobacterial 16s rrna gene was chosen to normalize the raw expression levels of cyanophage transcripts within the host cells based on the protocol described by yoshida et al 2010 the relative number of the ma lmm01 like cyanophages g91 mrna was determined by dividing the amounts of mentioned transcript copies by the quantities of microcystis 16s rrna transcript copies 3 results and discussion the presence of the microcystis genus represented by the 16s rrna gene was confirmed during diurnal monitoring in both reservoirs fig 2 the value of the 16s rrna gene copy number ranged from 5 99e 05 to 1 60e 06 in je and from 6 34e 05 to 1 03e 06 in su in the case of je the highest value was shown in the morning 6 00 10 00 am and late night 02 00 4 00 am time when it ranged from 1 38e 06 to 1 60e 06 for su the highest values were found in the morning 6 00 am and afternoon 2 00 4 00 pm hours in the gene copy number between 8 80e 05 and 1 03e 06 fig 2 the daily dynamics of microcystis spp occurrence represented by 16s rrna gene copy number were found to have various patterns depending on the reservoir which could be explained inter alia by the different genera dominance in studied days the analyzes of rpob nucleotide sequences accession numbers mz429428 mz429429 mz429430 showed that microcystis spp and aphanizomenon spp co dominated in je while the microcystis genus was the dominant group in su table s1 supplementary materials based on the fact that the g91 gene fragment was detected in all analyzed samples it can be assumed that cyanophages were present in host cells during the studied days the value of the g91 gene copy ranged between 1 04e 05 5 21e 05 and 4 35e 03e 1 53e 04 in je and su respectively the highest values were observed in the morning 6 00 10 00 am and late night 2 00 4 00 am on the level between 3 04e 05 5 21e 05 in je the three peaks of the g91 gene copy number were found in su ranging between 9 48e 03 1 53e 04 the first one was in the morning 6 00 10 00 am the second one was in the evening 6 00 pm 10 00 pm and the last peak was at 4 00 am the analyzed transcripts also were found to be presented throughout the entire investigated sampling period during the je daily period the relative g91 transcript abundance ranged between 1 67e 05 to 9 26e 05 while in su it was between 5 79e 08 to 2 98e 04 a similar time of increase in g91 transcription which occurred from morning till afternoon at 08 00 am 12 00 pm and 04 00 pm was found in both reservoirs for je the highest peak was at 04 00 pm and 12 00 pm for su in the late afternoon and night hours the transcription was low fig 3 we observed some differences in the presented abundance dynamics of analyzed gene fragments between both reservoirs precisely only

copies amount of this cyanophage gene during morning and late night hours in su an increase in the g91 copies amount was found additionally during afternoon time after the appearance of a higher 16s rrna gene copy number it might be suspected that the increase in the amount of g91 cyanophage copies was related to the accumulation of microcystis spp near the surface due to vertical migration such a situation was observed during night time by kimura et al 2012 within its second investigated diurnal period kimura et al stated that the increase in g91 dna copy number was rather related to mentioned microcystis spp accumulation despite the observed differences between daily dynamics occurrence of microcystis spp and cyanophage in je and su it was found that the cyanophage g91 transcription pattern in host cell from both studied reservoirs was similar it exhibited greater activity during daylight and lower within the night time and thus also reflected the transcription results presented by kimura et al 2012 it can be assumed that the result from je and su confirmed the possibility of a daily trend for cyanophages infection which may indicate the important role of the light cycle in mentioned process additionally the g91 gene fragments from both reservoirs were compared with their counterparts obtained from the genbank database fig 4 fig s1 and fig s2 from

1006,the light dark cycle seems to influence the infection pattern of cyanophages this may be related to their dependence on the photosynthetic process of their hosts cyanobacteria the present study examined the daily occurrence dynamic of microcystis with the use of the 16s rrna gene and the ma lmm01 like cyanophages with the use of the g91 gene in jeziorsko and sulejow reservoirs poland also the daily expression pattern of mentioned cyanophages gene was investigated the daily dynamic of cyanophage was mainly associated with microcystis occurrence however the g91 transcription exhibited greater activity during daylight and lowered within nighttime in both water bodies the maximum transcription was found at 4 00 pm in jeziorsko and 12 00 pm in sulejow reservoirs additionally the g91

reservoir mankiewicz boczek et al 2016 cyanophages from the myoviridae family have co occurred with microcystis spp and a correlation between their occurrence was observed in the mentioned study the structural gene of g91 encoding the viral sheath protein was used as a marker of cyanophages from the myoviridae family specific to cyanobacteria of the microcystis genus the sequence of the tested structural gene is considered as a marker of the viral lytic cycle and it was obtained from the genome sequence known as ma lmm01 type cyanophage which is based on genomes of ma lmm01 cyanophage and

as their main source of atp and nadph as well is needed for the acquisition of organic compounds carbon dioxide and other mineral substances thomson et al 2016 according to sought et al 2017 analyzes the transcription pattern of some genes involved in the oxygenic photosynthesis process depends on the daylight due to the fact that the host derived genes have been found in cyanophages it is thought that they can use the diurnal behavior of their hosts to multiply descendant phages ni and zeng 2016 in the case of ma lmm01 like cyanophages specific to the microcystis genus the diel cycle into the natural host population was shown only in hirosawanoike pond in japan kimura et al 2012 according to available literature there is a lack of such information from other geographic locations thus the present study attempts to determine the evidence of cyanophages diurnal presence and transcriptional rhythm from two lowland reservoirs from central europe poland for better understanding cyanophage

1007,eutrophication is one of the most pressing problems affecting water quality as a consequence harmful algae blooms habs are intensifying their occurrence in many aquatic ecosystems around the world under this water quality risk scenario long term monitoring arises as a need to recognize understand and anticipate the habs outbreaks however existing monitoring methodologies are limited when dealing with habs thus forcing to make assumptions and decisions based on interpolated and inconsistent data this conceptual paper attempts to highlight the importance of moving towards an integrated water monitoring methodology where manual sampling on site automatic high frequency monitoring ahfm and remote sensing are aligned to facilitates decision making in addition because of the key role of microbial communities on the drift of aquatic ecosystems and water quality they should be considered as a key element in habs monitoring and management programs in this manner the biotic knowledge could be integrated into coordinated response plans as ecosystem management tools therefore this holistic approach could provide decision makers and stakeholders an adaptive water resource management grounded on the theory of ecohydrology 1 short communication water resources are in the focus of concerns related to climate change and human impact on nature changes in the hydrological cycle due to global warming tabari 2020 together with intensification on water demand linked to the rising of population economic growth rapid urbanization water pollution and overexploitation of water resources for food and energy production boretti and rosa 2019 have become the most critical challenge for modern society reaching 10 billion of people in the middle of this century future water demand projections are even less favorable united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco 2020 therefore it is imperative to preserve water resources according to the sixth sustainable development goal dictated by the united nations 2030 agenda which evokes to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all in this context unesco s international hydrological program devoted to water research and management focuses on six thematic areas including ecohydrology thus considering an integrative approach of the following subjects to enhance catchments sustainability potential water biodiversity resilience ecosystem services and cultural heritage wbrs c zalewski et al 2016 the worsening of water quality with eutrophication at the forefront of the most worrying issues is one of the pressing challenges that decision makers stakeholders and the scientific community must face le moal et al 2019 nutrient pollutants released by agricultural industrial and urban settlements to rivers and groundwater later accumulated in lakes reservoirs and coastal areas are intensifying harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms harmful algae blooms habs at a global scale glibert 2020 harke et al 2016 these habs are a major threat for the environment and public health due to the devastating negative effects that they trigger on aquatic ecosystems and water quality for instance massive algal proliferation in the epilimnion generates turbid waters which restrict light penetration and do not enable the development of benthic photosynthetic organisms this unbalance in the trophic chain triggers biodiversity losses aggravated by the post bloom algal decay since the decomposition of the biomass generates anoxia and aquatic animal death by asphyxia moreover habs dominated by toxic cyanobacteria deserve special attention certain cyanobacterial species produce a wide range of toxins and other non toxic substances affecting the aesthetic properties of water e g 2 methylisoborneol and geosmin which compromise the usage of water resources for drinking domestic use food production and recreation purposes chorus and welker 2021 because these toxins can affect various organs and tissues of animals for more than half a century a plethora of hab events have been associated with severe poisonings of wildlife domestic animals and humans svirčev et al 2019 under this water quality risk scenario long term monitoring arises as a need to recognize understand and anticipate habs outbreaks nowadays routine monitoring programs are the basis of most decision making protocols as they provide substantial information about physicochemical parameters of water the presence of problematic cyanobacteria and emerging contaminants however they are regularly performed by collecting water samples by hand at low periodicity and with a limited number of sampling points which hampers proper monitoring of habs events with variable dynamics over space and time davis et al 2019 innovative water monitoring alternatives have been proposed by using remote sensing and on site automatic high frequency monitoring ahfm systems satellite imagery allows the monitoring area to be expanded through measuring the different wavelengths reflected by photosynthetic pigments e g chlorophylls phycocyanin or phycoerythrin of algae and cyanobacteria along waterbodies malthus et al 2019 oyama et al 2016 on the other hand ahfm systems permit the systematic connection even at real time between users and the natural environment by deploying physicochemical sensors on buoys e g sensors for measuring photosynthetic pigments ph temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen nitrate etc mishra et al 2020 morón lópez et al 2020b yang et al 2019 nonetheless these groundbreaking technologies also present significant limitations remote sensing may lead to biased estimates as precise monitoring is sometimes difficult due to interference from cloud cover the complex optics of water or the difficult distinction between the pigments of algae and other vegetation in the monitored environment chang et al 2015 likewise ahfm systems are mainly constrained by the high prices derived from the acquisition and maintenance of devices as well as the fact that the data collected are specific to the places where sensors are deployed chaffin et al 2020 2018 morón lópez et al 2020b these limitations together with the variable dimension of affected waterbodies from small ponds to large waterbodies such as the great lakes or lake taihu from eeuu and china respectively and the discrepancies of the different monitoring methodologies bertani et al 2017 force to make assumptions and decisions based on interpolated and inconsistent data for these reasons it is of paramount importance to move towards an integrated water monitoring approach that provides realistic and heterogeneous information figure 1 current advances in machine learning techniques allow to connect the sources of the environmental problem and track causes and effects in a massive volume of data this facilitates decision making and allows to unravel underlying relationships between the multiple factors both abiotic and biotic related to habs dynamics cruz et al 2021 derot et al 2020 therefore the combination of multiple methodologies manual ahfm satellite supported by advanced data processing would help to develop accurate forecasting systems thus offering a framework for appropriate prevention and mitigation strategies as an example some effective methods to mitigate habs are decreasing nutrient loads in sewage discharge controlling stormwater and groundwater runoff by nature based solutions e g ecotone zones denitrification barriers and sedimentation biofiltration systems along with avoiding fertilizer overload in agricultural soils bednarek et al 2014 krauze and wagner 2019 paerl and barnard 2020 however despite the great research and management efforts these strategies are not always enough due to the multiple point and non point sources of contamination and therefore habs become challenging in order to apply the proper solutions at the best place and time it is necessary to connect strategic locations throughout the basin e g waterbodies water catchments wastewater and runoff discharges etc which could be possible by deploying extensive low cost sensor networks morón lópez et al 2020b this would simplify manual sampling and allow better satellite estimates while improving forecast systems for coordinating the response actions figure 1 accordingly decision makers and stakeholders could accomplish an adaptive water resource management by harmonizing environmental services hydrological management and ecosystem resilience zalewski 2014 considering the implementation of an integrated monitoring for a coordinated response plan it is important to note that current habs monitoring programs are mainly focused on abiotic variables hydrologic climatic and physicochemical but they overlook biotic interactions for the last decades many studies have demonstrated that microbial communities are structured and interconnected highlighting the role of ecosystems inhabitants as habs regulators bjorbækmo et al 2020 fu et al 2020 for instance many studies have demonstrated that associate microbiota can act synergistically on harmful algae species by supporting their growth during early stages of the bloom seymour et al 2017 in contrast other microorganisms exert antagonistic effects leading to its termination meyer et al 2017 it is widely known the importance of bacterial communities on nutrient recycling and pollutants removal and this knowledge has sustained innovative biotechnological solutions to mitigate habs impact in real scenarios font nájera et al 2021b 2021a 2020 mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 likewise findings in hab associated bacteria have shown the capability of some species to degrade microcystins mc massey and yang 2020 exemplifying how understanding the role of biota in ecosystem functioning reveals meaningful information for problem solving figure 2 mc are one of the most toxic and worldwide spread hepatotoxins produced by certain cyanobacterial species in freshwater reason for which the world health organization who recommends not to exceed 1 µg l 1 of mc lr in drinking water who 2020 the ability to degrade mc is given but not only by a specific cluster of genes called mlr mlrabcd of which the mlra gene is used as a marker for mc biodegradation capacity because it encodes the first and most crucial step in reducing its toxicity yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the increasing number of isolated bacteria from the natural environment with such ability have promoted biological systems as an alternative or supplementation to physicochemical processes during drinking water treatments kumar et al 2019a li et al 2017 in fact novel bioreactors have been proposed to enhance the mc degrading capacity of those isolated bacteria to the maximum kumar et al 2019b morón lópez and molina 2020 somdee et al 2016 accordingly biotic factors need to be considered as a key element in hab monitoring programs and thus hab associated microbiota could be integrated into mitigation strategies as ecosystem management tools in order to achieve the sustainable management of water resources it is also important to bear in mind that the implementation of nature based solutions must be compatible with the circular economy model a good example of the benefits of addressing current water needs through such principles is the use of recycled materials to design sustainable water treatment systems figure 3 morón lópez et al 2018 membrane based industrial desalination is well established worldwide to obtain freshwater from seawater and brackish water however this technology generates a considerable amount of discarded membranes estimated at more than 840 000 end of life eol membranes 14 000 tn year 1 worldwide every year landaburu aguirre et al 2016 given the characteristics that these discarded membranes exhibit in configuration and composition together with the inherited fouling after their life as desalination membranes these wastes have been proposed as recycled support materials in membrane biofilm

1007,eutrophication is one of the most pressing problems affecting water quality as a consequence harmful algae blooms habs are intensifying their occurrence in many aquatic ecosystems around the world under this water quality risk scenario long term monitoring arises as a need to recognize understand and anticipate the habs outbreaks however existing monitoring methodologies are limited when dealing with habs thus forcing to make assumptions and decisions based on interpolated and inconsistent data this conceptual paper attempts to highlight the importance of moving towards an integrated water monitoring methodology where manual sampling on site automatic high frequency monitoring ahfm and remote sensing are aligned to facilitates decision making in addition because of the key role of microbial communities on the drift of aquatic ecosystems and water quality they should be considered as a key element in habs monitoring and management programs in this manner the biotic knowledge could be integrated into coordinated response plans as ecosystem management tools therefore this holistic approach could provide decision makers and stakeholders an adaptive water resource management grounded on the theory of ecohydrology 1 short communication water resources are in the focus of concerns related to climate change and human impact on nature changes in the hydrological cycle due to global warming tabari 2020 together with intensification on water demand linked to the rising of population economic growth rapid urbanization water pollution and overexploitation of water resources for food and energy production boretti and rosa 2019 have become the most critical challenge for modern society reaching 10 billion of people in the middle of this century future water demand projections are even less favorable united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco 2020 therefore it is imperative to preserve water resources according to the sixth sustainable development goal dictated by the united nations 2030 agenda which evokes to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all in this context unesco s international hydrological program devoted to water research and management focuses on six thematic areas including ecohydrology thus considering an integrative approach of the following subjects to enhance catchments sustainability potential water biodiversity resilience ecosystem services and cultural heritage wbrs c zalewski et al 2016 the worsening of water quality with eutrophication at the forefront of the most worrying issues is one of the pressing challenges that decision makers stakeholders and the scientific community must face le moal et al 2019 nutrient pollutants released by agricultural industrial and urban settlements to rivers and groundwater later accumulated in lakes reservoirs and coastal areas are intensifying harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms harmful algae blooms habs at a global scale glibert 2020 harke et al 2016 these habs are a major threat for the environment and public health due to the devastating negative effects that they trigger on aquatic ecosystems and water quality for instance massive algal proliferation in the epilimnion generates turbid waters which restrict light penetration and do not enable the development of benthic photosynthetic organisms this unbalance in the trophic chain triggers biodiversity losses aggravated by the post bloom algal decay since the decomposition of the biomass generates anoxia and aquatic animal death by asphyxia moreover habs dominated by toxic cyanobacteria deserve special attention certain cyanobacterial species produce a wide range of toxins and other non toxic substances affecting the aesthetic properties of water e g 2 methylisoborneol and geosmin which compromise the usage of water resources for drinking domestic use food production and recreation purposes chorus and welker 2021 because these toxins can affect various organs and tissues of animals for more than half a century a plethora of hab events have been associated with severe poisonings of wildlife domestic animals and humans svirčev et al 2019 under this water quality risk scenario long term monitoring arises as a need to recognize understand and anticipate habs outbreaks nowadays routine monitoring programs are the basis of most decision making protocols as they provide substantial information about physicochemical parameters of water the presence of problematic cyanobacteria and emerging contaminants however they are regularly performed by collecting water samples by hand at low periodicity and with a limited number of sampling points which hampers proper monitoring of habs events with variable dynamics over space and time davis et al 2019 innovative water monitoring alternatives have been proposed by using remote sensing and on site automatic high frequency monitoring ahfm systems satellite imagery allows the monitoring area to be expanded through measuring the different wavelengths reflected by photosynthetic pigments e g chlorophylls phycocyanin or phycoerythrin of algae and cyanobacteria along waterbodies malthus et al 2019 oyama et al 2016 on the other hand ahfm systems permit the systematic connection even at real time between users and the natural environment by deploying physicochemical sensors on buoys e g sensors for measuring photosynthetic pigments ph temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen nitrate etc mishra et al 2020 morón lópez et al 2020b yang et al 2019 nonetheless these groundbreaking technologies also present significant limitations remote sensing may lead to biased estimates as precise monitoring is sometimes difficult due to interference from cloud cover the complex optics of water or the difficult distinction between the pigments of algae and other vegetation in the monitored environment chang et al 2015 likewise ahfm systems are mainly constrained by the high prices derived from the acquisition and maintenance of devices as well as the fact that the data collected are specific to the places where sensors are deployed chaffin et al 2020 2018 morón lópez et al 2020b these limitations together with the variable dimension of affected waterbodies from small ponds to large waterbodies such as the great lakes or lake taihu from eeuu and china respectively and the discrepancies of the different monitoring methodologies bertani et al 2017 force to make assumptions and decisions based on interpolated and inconsistent data for these reasons it is of paramount importance to move towards an integrated water monitoring approach that provides realistic and heterogeneous information figure 1 current advances in machine learning techniques allow to connect the sources of the environmental problem and track causes and effects in a massive volume of data this facilitates decision making and allows to unravel underlying relationships between the multiple factors both abiotic and biotic related to habs dynamics cruz et al 2021 derot et al 2020 therefore the combination of multiple methodologies manual ahfm satellite supported by advanced data processing would help to develop accurate forecasting systems thus offering a framework for appropriate prevention and mitigation strategies as an example some effective methods to mitigate habs are decreasing nutrient loads in sewage discharge controlling stormwater and groundwater runoff by nature based solutions e g ecotone zones denitrification barriers and sedimentation biofiltration systems along with avoiding fertilizer overload in agricultural soils bednarek et al 2014 krauze and wagner 2019 paerl and barnard 2020 however despite the great research and management efforts these strategies are not always enough due to the multiple point and non point sources of contamination and therefore habs become challenging in order to apply the proper solutions at the best place and time it is necessary to connect strategic locations throughout the basin e g waterbodies water catchments wastewater and runoff discharges etc which could be possible by deploying extensive low cost sensor networks morón lópez et al 2020b this would simplify manual sampling and allow better satellite estimates while improving forecast systems for coordinating the response actions figure 1 accordingly decision makers and stakeholders could accomplish an adaptive water resource management by harmonizing environmental services hydrological management and ecosystem resilience zalewski 2014 considering the implementation of an integrated monitoring for a coordinated response plan it is important to note that current habs monitoring programs are mainly focused on abiotic variables hydrologic climatic and physicochemical but they overlook biotic interactions for the last decades many studies have demonstrated that microbial communities are structured and interconnected highlighting the role of ecosystems inhabitants as habs regulators bjorbækmo et al 2020 fu et al 2020 for instance many studies have demonstrated that associate microbiota can act synergistically on harmful algae species by supporting their growth during early stages of the bloom seymour et al 2017 in contrast other microorganisms exert antagonistic effects leading to its termination meyer et al 2017 it is widely known the importance of bacterial communities on nutrient recycling and pollutants removal and this knowledge has sustained innovative biotechnological solutions to mitigate habs impact in real scenarios font nájera et al 2021b 2021a 2020 mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 likewise findings in hab associated bacteria have shown the capability of some species to degrade microcystins mc massey and yang 2020 exemplifying how understanding the role of biota in ecosystem functioning reveals meaningful information for problem solving figure 2 mc are one of the most toxic and worldwide spread hepatotoxins produced by certain cyanobacterial species in freshwater reason for which the world health organization who recommends not to exceed 1 µg l 1 of mc lr in drinking water who 2020 the ability to degrade mc is given but not only by a specific cluster of genes called mlr mlrabcd of which the mlra gene is used as a marker for mc biodegradation capacity because it encodes the first and most crucial step in reducing its toxicity yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the increasing number of isolated bacteria from the natural environment with such ability have promoted biological systems as an alternative or supplementation to physicochemical processes during drinking water treatments kumar et al 2019a li et al 2017 in fact novel bioreactors have been proposed to enhance the mc degrading capacity of those isolated bacteria to the maximum kumar et al 2019b morón lópez and molina 2020 somdee et al 2016 accordingly biotic factors need to be considered as a key element in hab monitoring programs and thus hab associated microbiota could be integrated into mitigation strategies as ecosystem management tools in order to achieve the sustainable management of water resources it is also important to bear in mind that the implementation of nature based solutions must be compatible with the circular economy model a good example of the benefits of addressing current water needs through such principles is the use of recycled materials to design sustainable water treatment systems figure 3 morón lópez et al 2018 membrane based industrial desalination is well established worldwide to obtain freshwater from seawater and brackish water however this technology generates a considerable amount of discarded membranes estimated at more than 840 000 end of life eol membranes 14 000 tn year 1 worldwide every year landaburu aguirre et al 2016 given the characteristics that these discarded membranes exhibit in configuration and composition together with the inherited fouling after their life as desalination membranes these wastes have been proposed as recycled support materials in membrane biofilm

1008,urban stormwater flooding and pollution are severe issues due to connected impervious surfaces over recent decades solutions to these issues have been towards stormwater source control measures we developed an innovative cost efficient stormwater infiltration filter made of gravel peat mixture and geotextile laboratory column tests were conducted to compare a range of volumetric ratios of gravel limestone and silica to peat regarding their heavy metal removal efficiency re the tested heavy metals were cadmium lead and zinc all ratios had a high re 95 9 100 despite very high initial metal concentrations the 5lg 1p mixture i e volumetric ratio of limestone gravel to peat was 5 1 had the highest re 99 6 100 and is suggested as a good candidate for implementation if a longer term use is required a 5sg 10lg 3p mixture i e volumetric ratio of silica gravel limestone gravel and peat of 5 10 3 is recommended as it kept the high heavy metal re with a lower clogging potential and lower cost than the 5lg 1p mixture the most convenient but expensive filter material with high re is limestone gravel alone finally we proposed two field designs for implementing the infiltration filter which incorporate concepts of treatment train and good urban design we also provided some suggestions for the installation of gravel peat infiltration filters keywords heavy metal removal cadmium lead zinc stormwater control measure mixed structure 1 introduction urbanization has significantly changed hydrologic processes mainly due to the construction of impervious surfaces connected to conventional stormwater drainage systems that focus on fast transfer of stormwater the hydrologic alterations include augmented surface runoff reduced stormwater infiltration and evapotranspiration and thus increased stormflow reduced baseflow and increased variation in flow magnitude leopold 1968 konrad and booth 2005 shuster et al 2005 walsh et al 2012 impacts of such hydrologic alterations have been well documented in the literature such as urban stormwater flooding water pollution and degradation of receiving waterbodies bunn and arthington 2002 walsh et al 2005 askarizadeh et al 2015 stormwater flooding as a result of growing impervious urban area and extreme rain events is of great concern in many cities some cities also suffer from groundwater overexploitation and droughts during dry periods which indicates the importance of promoting stormwater infiltration to recharge groundwater li 2012 among stormwater contaminants heavy metals are different because of their high toxicity non biodegradation and bioaccumulation some metals are toxic even at very low concentrations e g cd cr and as while others are essential elements for the human body in minute quantities e g zn and pb mohammed et al 2011 thus removal of such heavy metals is an important objective of stormwater treatment recent evolution in stormwater management is aimed at providing ecohydrological approaches to addressing the stormwater issues zalewski and wagner 2005 fletcher et al 2014 the ecohydrological perspective of reversing the negative modification on urban hydrologic processes is to use the understanding of ecosystem processes as the base of catchment management thus to enhance water resources in urban space ecohydrological approaches aim to enhance stormwater detention retention evapotranspiration purification infiltration and harvesting marsalek and chocat 2002 systematically applying these approaches can make a city resilient to pollution and climate change for example the blue green network concept is based on connected rivers and green space zalewski et al 2012 among others filtration and infiltration systems play a very important role in improving stormwater purification and infiltration these systems can reduce stormwater surface runoff recharge groundwater and remove contaminants from stormwater many materials have been used in the infiltration and filtration facilities especially gravel and peat gravel is one of the main materials used in infiltration facilities hatt et al 2007 peat is a very promising filter material due to its cost effectiveness sufficient quantity and easiness of employment brown et al 2000 kalmykova et al 2009 however natural peat is mechanically weak highly hydrophilic chemically instable and compressible couillard 1994 kennedy and geel 2000 thus natural peat is usually modified or utilized together with other materials in layers to form filter media sorbents such as algae treated peat lourie and gjengedal 2011 peat filter couillard 1994 zhou et al 2003 vertical flow soil filter janzen et al 2009 and peat calcium silicate rock färm 2002 however challenges in using these facilities remain including high consumption of land area potential groundwater contamination clogging and short lifetime marsalek 2001 in particular clogging is a common problem in the application of filters with peat due to pores of media blocked by pollutants and changed material properties mclellan and rock 1988 kalmykova et al 2009 we argue that these issues and potential risks may be reduced by 1 developing techniques of high capacity of stormwater filtration and infiltration to reduce land area consumption and mitigate groundwater contamination 2 introducing materials with stable physical chemical properties e g silica gravel into filter media to increase the lifetime of such techniques and 3 using a mixed filter structure rather than the commonly used layered structure e g couillard 1994 zhou et al 2003 to reduce the risk of clogging though the mixed structure has been applied the effect of different ratios of materials in a mixture remains poorly studied reddy et al 2014 ratio of materials in a mixture affects not only the stormwater treatment effect but also the cost of required materials therefore we developed an easy to use and cost efficient gravel peat infiltration filter with a mixed structure of materials the tested filter materials include limestone gravel silica gravel peat and geotextile among all heavy metals in stormwater runoff cadmium lead and zinc were selected for our research the overarching objective of our laboratory experiments is to identify a best infiltration filter media that has the highest heavy metal removal efficiency while having low cost good hydraulic conductivity and physio chemical stability we also proposed two field designs a hand shape and a round dance floor shape which integrate the infiltration filter with good urban design in the two field designs treatment train and good urban design li 2012 concepts were applied to collect and treat all stormwater nearby and create recreational services we then provided suggestions on the installation schemes of the gravel peat filter based on several geological conditions such infiltration filters will play an important role in reducing surface runoff improving stormwater quality and recharging groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 column materials and structure infiltration filter columns were constructed using identical plexiglas pipes diameter 144 mm and height 350 mm containing the main filter media height 266 mm two geotextile layers height 10 mm each and four fibre layers at the bottom fig 1 pervious steel plates were used to support the columns and allow stormwater effluents to flow into plastic containers washed by distilled water fig 1 materials tested as the media of the gravel peat filters were peat p limestone gravel lg and silica gravel sg see their properties in table 1 they were low cost natural materials without pre treatment and easy to acquire peat had the lowest cost followed by silica gravel peat as a highly organic polar material can absorb most metals substantially couillard 1994 zhou et al 2003 through mechanisms including surface adsorption ion exchange complexation chelating and lone pair electron sharing brown et al 2000 kalmykova et al 2008 limestone gravel is alkaline and thus can increase the ph of the treatment environment to improve the heavy metal removal efficiency as peat is mechanically weak and limestone gravel may degrade with time the hydraulic conductivity may decrease and clogging may occur we hypothesized that this risk would be reduced by adding silica gravel that does not react with heavy metals and thus has the highest physical and chemical stability a mixed structure of gravel and peat was adopted instead of the commonly used layered structure to test its performance in stormwater purification and infiltration and resistance to clogging geotextile was used on the top to trap sediments and at the bottom see fig 1 and table 1 to control peat leakage because our pre experiment showed that without geotextile in the column concentration values of cadmium and zinc in stormwater effluents increased because of peat leakage 2 2 column selection and dosing the experiment included two parts 1 experiment 1 was to identify the best mixture of limestone gravel and peat volumetric ratio that has high heavy metal removal efficiency and high peat fraction and 2 experiment 2 was to test whether this mixture can maintain a similar removal efficiency after replacing one third of its limestone gravel with silica gravel in experiment 1 three volumetric ratios of limestone gravel to peat were selected based on their ph values and peat fractions the ph values of these lg p ratios were measured using distilled water ph 6 37 once per day for four days the three selected volumetric ratios were 1 2lg 1p ph 6 6 0 4 2 5lg 1p ph 6 9 0 3 and 3 7lg 1p ph 7 3 0 2 a column of pure limestone gravel was taken as the experimental control original total input of limestone gravel and peat for each column was 4400 ml and the mean dry mixture was 4336 ml in total 12 columns were prepared for 4 3 media 4 different volumetric ratios and 3 identical columns for each volumetric ratio in experiment 2 we compared the heavy metal removal efficiency of the 15lg 3p mixture i e 5lg 1p which had the highest heavy metal removal efficiency shown in experiment 1 and the 10lg 5sg 3p mixture i e replacing 1 3 limestone gravel in 5lg 1p with silica gravel original total input of gravel and peat for each column is 4320 ml and the mean dry mixture is 4062 ml in total 6 columns were prepared for 2 3 media 2 different mixtures and 3 identical columns for each mixture 2 3 hydraulic conductivity measurement darcy s experiment falling head test was conducted to measure hydraulic conductivity of these gravel peat mixtures with geotextile layers on the top and bottom the experiment was designed according to pazdro 1983 and tap water was used the average bulk density of peat in each mixture was 0 62 kg l the bulk density of limestone gravel and silica gravel were 1 56 kg l and 1 52 kg l respectively 2 4 artificial rain events artificial rain events were identically produced in experiment 1 and experiment 2 using a hand spray for each column each rain event had an intensity of 60 mm hour a duration of 1 hour and a total of 977 2 ml stormwater in experiment 1 one rain event was produced for each column in experiment 2 one rain event per day was produced for each column for two days to check the difference in the heavy metal removal efficiency between the two rain events 2 5 heavy metal concentration and removal efficiency we set relatively high target values of heavy metal concentration which were similar to the reported values in the literature see table 2 to reach such high values heavy metal chemical solutions were added into original stormwater to make semi synthetic stormwater the heavy metal chemical solutions were heavy metal ions in a solution of nitric acid at a concentration of 0 1 mol dm 3 the original stormwater was taken from an upstream stormwater collector in the sokolowka river in lodz poland stormwater effluent from each column was collected the next day after the rain event the heavy metal concentration values in the effluent samples were measured by the wastewater treatment plant grupowa oczyszczalnia sciekow in lodz poland the method pn en iso 15586 2005 was used to measure the concentration of cd and pb the method pn iso 8288 2002 method a was used to measure the concentration of zn heavy metal removal efficiency re of the infiltration filter media was calculated as the percentage reduction of heavy metal concentration from stormwater influent to effluent 1 1 r e 1 c e c i 100 where re is the removal efficiency of heavy metal from stormwater ce is heavy metal concentration in the stormwater effluent μg l and ci is heavy metal concentration in the stormwater influent μg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 results the hydraulic conductivity of these mixtures ranges from 41 to 608 mm hour i e k20 41 608 mm hour the hydraulic conductivity measurement was affected by the uncertainty in the compaction of peat due to its unstable physical structure in experiment 1 all three heavy metals were greatly removed re 95 88 and most re values approached 100 table 3 among the four media tested the 5lg 1p mixture had the highest peat fraction and overall heavy metal removal efficiencies while the 2lg 1p mixture had the lowest heavy metal removal efficiencies therefore 5lg 1p was selected as the best mixture and was taken as a control in experiment 2 in experiment 2 both mixtures performed excellently and the re values were very similar between the two rain events table 3 all the re values approached 100 except that the zn removal efficiency by 5g 10lg 3p was slightly lower than 98 from the 1st day to 2nd day rain event the zn removal by 5sg 10lg 3p decreased slightly in general after replacing 1 3 limestone gravel in the 5lg 1p mixture with silica gravel the newly formed mixture 5sg 10lg 3p kept the high removal efficiencies of cd and pb but slightly lower removal efficiency of zn compared with the 5lg 1p mixture thus we would recommend the 5sg 10lg 3p mixture if long term use would be most required because silica gravel was cheaper and more physical chemically stable than limestone gravel 3 2 effectiveness of the gravel peat infiltration filters the heavy metal removal efficiencies re of our gravel peat filters were compared with the reported values in the literature table 4 according to the literature the sphagnum peat moss has the highest heavy metal removal efficiencies cd 99 1 pb 99 4 and zn 99 6 while stormwater biofilter infiltration trench and soakaway also have quite high heavy metal removal efficiencies comparison of table 3 and table 4 shows that the gravel peat filters have higher heavy metal removal efficiencies than all the facilities listed in table 4 it should be noted that the influent heavy metal concentration values in those studies are generally much lower than those in this research experiment scale is also a likely factor of influencing the heavy metal re 3 3 possible factors influencing heavy metal removal efficiency many factors can influence the heavy metal removal efficiency re in this experiment such as ph condition peat fraction hydraulic conductivity moisture content of mixtures and redistribution of mixture due to stormwater flow 3 3 1 ph condition and peat fraction peat fraction and ph condition were the primary factors that influenced the heavy metal removal efficiency in experiment 1 among the four types of media 2lg 1p mixture had the lowest re which could be mainly caused by its highest peat fraction and thus lowest ph value and the other three had similar res which might be due to their similar ph values this suggests that adding peat into limestone gravel could reduce the cost of materials without causing obviously decrease in heavy metal re in experiment 2 the higher zinc re of the 5sg 10lg 3p mixture than that of the 5lg 1p mixture indicates zinc re was affected by ph via the alkalinity of limestone gravel also due to the alkalinity of limestone gravel all the stormwater effluents had slightly higher ph ph 8 2 0 2 t 24 8 0 8 c than that of the stormwater influents ph 7 7 t 25 8 c 3 3 2 moisture content of filter media the absorbing ability of a medium mainly depends on the volume of peat contained and the pores between grains the larger volumes of peat and pores the more stormwater can be absorbed and the higher potential of absorbing heavy metals from stormwater for example effluent volume from dry media ranges from 314 ml to 525 ml was much lower than the influent volume 977 ml but decreased with the peat fraction the wet media only retained 20 stormwater from the 2nd day rain event in experiment 2 which likely contributed to the decrease in zinc re by the 5sg 10lg 1p mixture 3 3 3 other factors other possible factors influencing the heavy metal removal efficiency include hydraulic conductivity gravel peat mixing and slight redistribution of mixture via stormwater flow for example the mixing of gravel and peat was not strictly even and the mixture volume was often smaller than original inputs due to the poor stability of peat which affected the pore volume in the mixture 3 4 water quality assessment it may be of interest to assess how good the stormwater quality became after being treated by our infiltration filters according to groundwater quality standards as an example we assessed the stormwater quality according to the national groundwater quality standards in china quality standard for ground water gb t 14848 93 and poland journal of laws of 2001 no 115 item 1229 the result table 5 shows that all the stormwater effluents have drinking water quality class i iii which is safe for groundwater recharge 4 perspectives on the integration with good urban design 4 1 proposed field designs to promote the installation of gravel peat infiltration filters we proposed two multi functional field designs which adopted the concepts of treatment train and good urban design li 2012 the objective was to effectively collect and treat stormwater as close as where it falls and to integrate the infiltration filter with local landscape characteristics one example is a hand shape design which indicates that the gravel peat infiltration filter shall hold all the stormwater runoff from the targeted impervious area see fig 2 stormwater runoff flows through four concave grassy slopes fingers into the gravel peat filter surrounded by cobbles and a grassy area palm people can walk through the pervious pavement thumb to maintain the infiltration filter palm centre or to water the flower belt palm fringe for recreational use grass cobbles and pervious pavements can trap sediments slow down runoff velocity and promote stormwater infiltration before stormwater enters the infiltration filter for further treatment the elevation decreases from the outside to the inside which helps accumulate stormwater runoff into the infiltration filter the other example is a round dance floor shape design see fig 3 because it looks like an open round dance floor with grassy surfaces stormwater runoff flows through a series of grassy stairs into a grassy bottom at the centre of the dance floor the gravel peat infiltration filter was installed and surrounded by cobbles the grassy stairs grassy surfaces and cobbles can trap trash and sediments and reduce stormwater runoff during dry periods this system can act as an open dance floor after protecting the infiltration filter with an impervious steel cover on the top 4 2 suggestions on the installation to install these gravel peat infiltration filters a number of factors need to be considered including local hydrogeological geomorphological and hydrological features land availability and public needs these considerations are important for identifying the required infiltration filter volume and developing suitable filed designs we provide some suggestions for the installation of the gravel peat infiltration filter according to the following three situations fig 4 the first situation is when local soil has poor permeability much lower than the infiltration filter and there are wells nearby a thick layer of sand with good permeability and a geotextile layer can be added at the infiltration filter bottom and then the filter can be installed above the groundwater table the second situation is when soil has poor permeability much lower than the gravel peat infiltration filter and there are no wells nearby the filter can be directly installed above the groundwater table the third situation is when soil has good permeability close to or better than the gravel peat infiltration filter the infiltration filter is suggested to be installed above the groundwater table with a thick soil layer in between to separate the infiltration filter from the groundwater table since infiltration rate is the product of saturated hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient the infiltration rate of a gravel peat filter with a certain medium depends on the hydraulic gradient therefore it should be taken into account that increase in the groundwater table will cause decrease in the hydraulic gradient to less than 1 especially in the second situation however a slight rise of groundwater table may have little impact on the hydraulic gradient in the first and third situation decrease in the hydraulic gradient will reduce the infiltration rate but will not affect the final infiltration rate as long as the groundwater table has not yet reached the filter bottom hydraulic gradient 1 another problem is groundwater mounding if it is close to the filter the hydraulic gradient will be significantly reduced to less than 1 and the final infiltration rate will be much lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity massman 2003 therefore this issue should be well considered while installing a gravel peat infiltration filter in the field an example of the installation of a gravel peat infiltration filter is shown in fig 5 which is the third situation described above soil has good permeability the elevation decreases from the grassy area to the filter to help stormwater flow into the filter in order to conveniently operate and maintain the filter especially when the filter materials need to be renewed a pipe with a larger size than the filter can be installed around the filter when there is a need the filter can be directly taken out while leaving behind the outside pipe inside the soil to maintain the soil structure and the space for the coming filter according to our darcy s experiments hydraulic conductivity of a gravel peat infiltration filter especially the top part of the medium is sensitive to external forces thus to protect the filter from external forces a pervious steel cover could be added above the top geotextile layer with a small space in between which also helps evenly distribute stormwater over the filter surface after flowing through the gravel peat infiltration filter and the soil layer stormwater reaches groundwater body long term recharge of groundwater helps increase groundwater level and thus counteracts the negative effects of groundwater over exploitation 5 conclusions and further research in general the evidence and potential of the gravel peat infiltration filters have been demonstrated through our laboratory experiment to conclude all of the tested filter media had very high heavy metal removal efficiency re 95 44 among others the 5lg 1p mixture had the highest heavy metal removal efficiency 99 6 100 and high peat fraction peat was cheaper than gravel and thus was a good candidate to be implemented in the field the 5sg 10lg 1p mixture formed by replacing one third of the limestone gravel in the 5lg 1p mixture with silica gravel kept the high cd and pb removal efficiencies 99 2 99 9 but had a little bit lower zn removal efficiency 95 4 97 9 thus if a longer term use is most required the 5sg 10lg 1p mixture was recommended for implementation due to its higher physical chemical stability the most convenient filter media of high heavy metal re is limestone gravel alone which is however the most expensive choice we also provided two field design examples to demonstrate the integration of gravel peat infiltration filters with good urban design and treatment train concepts some suggestions were also provided for installing these infiltration filters in the field further research is required to promote a substantive implementation of such gravel peat infiltration filters at the laboratory scale this may include comprehensive measurements of hydraulic conductivity under various pressures and long term performance experiments under rainfall events of various sizes at the field scale this may include the infiltration rate measurement the long term monitoring of the removal efficiencies of heavy metals and other pollutants and the assessment of the filter resistance to clogging in addition the layered structure and mixed structure could be compared regarding their resistance to clogging

1008,urban stormwater flooding and pollution are severe issues due to connected impervious surfaces over recent decades solutions to these issues have been towards stormwater source control measures we developed an innovative cost efficient stormwater infiltration filter made of gravel peat mixture and geotextile laboratory column tests were conducted to compare a range of volumetric ratios of gravel limestone and silica to peat regarding their heavy metal removal efficiency re the tested heavy metals were cadmium lead and zinc all ratios had a high re 95 9 100 despite very high initial metal concentrations the 5lg 1p mixture i e volumetric ratio of limestone gravel to peat was 5 1 had the highest re 99 6 100 and is suggested as a good candidate for implementation if a longer term use is required a 5sg 10lg 3p mixture i e volumetric ratio of silica gravel limestone gravel and peat of 5 10 3 is recommended as it kept the high heavy metal re with a lower clogging potential and lower cost than the 5lg 1p mixture the most convenient but expensive filter material with high re is limestone gravel alone finally we proposed two field designs for implementing the infiltration filter which incorporate concepts of treatment train and good urban design we also provided some suggestions for the installation of gravel peat infiltration filters keywords heavy metal removal cadmium lead zinc stormwater control measure mixed structure 1 introduction urbanization has significantly changed hydrologic processes mainly due to the construction of impervious surfaces connected to conventional stormwater drainage systems that focus on fast transfer of stormwater the hydrologic alterations include augmented surface runoff reduced stormwater infiltration and evapotranspiration and thus increased stormflow reduced baseflow and increased variation in flow magnitude leopold 1968 konrad and booth 2005 shuster et al 2005 walsh et al 2012 impacts of such hydrologic alterations have been well documented in the literature such as urban stormwater flooding water pollution and degradation of receiving waterbodies bunn and arthington 2002 walsh et al 2005 askarizadeh et al 2015 stormwater flooding as a result of growing impervious urban area and extreme rain events is of great concern in many cities some cities also suffer from groundwater overexploitation and droughts during dry periods which indicates the importance of promoting stormwater infiltration to recharge groundwater li 2012 among stormwater contaminants heavy metals are different because of their high toxicity non biodegradation and bioaccumulation some metals are toxic even at very low concentrations e g cd cr and as while others are essential elements for the human body in minute quantities e g zn and pb mohammed et al 2011 thus removal of such heavy metals is an important objective of stormwater treatment recent evolution in stormwater management is aimed at providing ecohydrological approaches to addressing the stormwater issues zalewski and wagner 2005 fletcher et al 2014 the ecohydrological perspective of reversing the negative modification on urban hydrologic processes is to use the understanding of ecosystem processes as the base of catchment management thus to enhance water resources in urban space ecohydrological approaches aim to enhance stormwater detention retention evapotranspiration purification infiltration and harvesting marsalek and chocat 2002 systematically applying these approaches can make a city resilient to pollution and climate change for example the blue green network concept is based on connected rivers and green space zalewski et al 2012 among others filtration and infiltration systems play a very important role in improving stormwater purification and infiltration these systems can reduce stormwater surface runoff recharge groundwater and remove contaminants from stormwater many materials have been used in the infiltration and filtration facilities especially gravel and peat gravel is one of the main materials used in infiltration facilities hatt et al 2007 peat is a very promising filter material due to its cost effectiveness sufficient quantity and easiness of employment brown et al 2000 kalmykova et al 2009 however natural peat is mechanically weak highly hydrophilic chemically instable and compressible couillard 1994 kennedy and geel 2000 thus natural peat is usually modified or utilized together with other materials in layers to form filter media sorbents such as algae treated peat lourie and gjengedal 2011 peat filter couillard 1994 zhou et al 2003 vertical flow soil filter janzen et al 2009 and peat calcium silicate rock färm 2002 however challenges in using these facilities remain including high consumption of land area potential groundwater contamination clogging and short lifetime marsalek 2001 in particular clogging is a common problem in the application of filters with peat due to pores of media blocked by pollutants and changed material properties mclellan and rock 1988 kalmykova et al 2009 we argue that these issues and potential risks may be reduced by 1 developing techniques of high capacity of stormwater filtration and infiltration to reduce land area consumption and mitigate groundwater contamination 2 introducing materials with stable physical chemical properties e g silica gravel into filter media to increase the lifetime of such techniques and 3 using a mixed filter structure rather than the commonly used layered structure e g couillard 1994 zhou et al 2003 to reduce the risk of clogging though the mixed structure has been applied the effect of different ratios of materials in a mixture remains poorly studied reddy et al 2014 ratio of materials in a mixture affects not only the stormwater treatment effect but also the cost of required materials therefore we developed an easy to use and cost efficient gravel peat infiltration filter with a mixed structure of materials the tested filter materials include limestone gravel silica gravel peat and geotextile among all heavy metals in stormwater runoff cadmium lead and zinc were selected for our research the overarching objective of our laboratory experiments is to identify a best infiltration filter media that has the highest heavy metal removal efficiency while having low cost good hydraulic conductivity and physio chemical stability we also proposed two field designs a hand shape and a round dance floor shape which integrate the infiltration filter with good urban design in the two field designs treatment train and good urban design li 2012 concepts were applied to collect and treat all stormwater nearby and create recreational services we then provided suggestions on the installation schemes of the gravel peat filter based on several geological conditions such infiltration filters will play an important role in reducing surface runoff improving stormwater quality and recharging groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 column materials and structure infiltration filter columns were constructed using identical plexiglas pipes diameter 144 mm and height 350 mm containing the main filter media height 266 mm two geotextile layers height 10 mm each and four fibre layers at the bottom fig 1 pervious steel plates were used to support the columns and allow stormwater effluents to flow into plastic containers washed by distilled water fig 1 materials tested as the media of the gravel peat filters were peat p limestone gravel lg and silica gravel sg see their properties in table 1 they were low cost natural materials without pre treatment and easy to acquire peat had the lowest cost followed by silica gravel peat as a highly organic polar material can absorb most metals substantially couillard 1994 zhou et al 2003 through mechanisms including surface adsorption ion exchange complexation chelating and lone pair electron sharing brown et al 2000 kalmykova et al 2008 limestone gravel is alkaline and thus can increase the ph of the treatment environment to improve the heavy metal removal efficiency as peat is mechanically weak and limestone gravel may degrade with time the hydraulic conductivity may decrease and clogging may occur we hypothesized that this risk would be reduced by adding silica gravel that does not react with heavy metals and thus has the highest physical and chemical stability a mixed structure of gravel and peat was adopted instead of the commonly used layered structure to test its performance in stormwater purification and infiltration and resistance to clogging geotextile was used on the top to trap sediments and at the bottom see fig 1 and table 1 to control peat leakage because our pre experiment showed that without geotextile in the column concentration values of cadmium and zinc in stormwater effluents increased because of peat leakage 2 2 column selection and dosing the experiment included two parts 1 experiment 1 was to identify the best mixture of limestone gravel and peat volumetric ratio that has high heavy metal removal efficiency and high peat fraction and 2 experiment 2 was to test whether this mixture can maintain a similar removal efficiency after replacing one third of its limestone gravel with silica gravel in experiment 1 three volumetric ratios of limestone gravel to peat were selected based on their ph values and peat fractions the ph values of these lg p ratios were measured using distilled water ph 6 37 once per day for four days the three selected volumetric ratios were 1 2lg 1p ph 6 6 0 4 2 5lg 1p ph 6 9 0 3 and 3 7lg 1p ph 7 3 0 2 a column of pure limestone gravel was taken as the experimental control original total input of limestone gravel and peat for each column was 4400 ml and the mean dry mixture was 4336 ml in total 12 columns were prepared for 4 3 media 4 different volumetric ratios and 3 identical columns for each volumetric ratio in experiment 2 we compared the heavy metal removal efficiency of the 15lg 3p mixture i e 5lg 1p which had the highest heavy metal removal efficiency shown in experiment 1 and the 10lg 5sg 3p mixture i e replacing 1 3 limestone gravel in 5lg 1p with silica gravel original total input of gravel and peat for each column is 4320 ml and the mean dry mixture is 4062 ml in total 6 columns were prepared for 2 3 media 2 different mixtures and 3 identical columns for each mixture 2 3 hydraulic conductivity measurement darcy s experiment falling head test was conducted to measure hydraulic conductivity of these gravel peat mixtures with geotextile layers on the top and bottom the experiment was designed according to pazdro 1983 and tap water was used the average bulk density of peat in each mixture was 0 62 kg l the bulk density of limestone gravel and silica gravel were 1 56 kg l and 1 52 kg l respectively 2 4 artificial rain events artificial rain events were identically produced in experiment 1 and experiment 2 using a hand spray for each column each rain event had an intensity of 60 mm hour a duration of 1 hour and a total of 977 2 ml stormwater in experiment 1 one rain event was produced for each column in experiment 2 one rain event per day was produced for each column for two days to check the difference in the heavy metal removal efficiency between the two rain events 2 5 heavy metal concentration and removal efficiency we set relatively high target values of heavy metal concentration which were similar to the reported values in the literature see table 2 to reach such high values heavy metal chemical solutions were added into original stormwater to make semi synthetic stormwater the heavy metal chemical solutions were heavy metal ions in a solution of nitric acid at a concentration of 0 1 mol dm 3 the original stormwater was taken from an upstream stormwater collector in the sokolowka river in lodz poland stormwater effluent from each column was collected the next day after the rain event the heavy metal concentration values in the effluent samples were measured by the wastewater treatment plant grupowa oczyszczalnia sciekow in lodz poland the method pn en iso 15586 2005 was used to measure the concentration of cd and pb the method pn iso 8288 2002 method a was used to measure the concentration of zn heavy metal removal efficiency re of the infiltration filter media was calculated as the percentage reduction of heavy metal concentration from stormwater influent to effluent 1 1 r e 1 c e c i 100 where re is the removal efficiency of heavy metal from stormwater ce is heavy metal concentration in the stormwater effluent μg l and ci is heavy metal concentration in the stormwater influent μg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 results the hydraulic conductivity of these mixtures ranges from 41 to 608 mm hour i e k20 41 608 mm hour the hydraulic conductivity measurement was affected by the uncertainty in the compaction of peat due to its unstable physical structure in experiment 1 all three heavy metals were greatly removed re 95 88 and most re values approached 100 table 3 among the four media tested the 5lg 1p mixture had the highest peat fraction and overall heavy metal removal efficiencies while the 2lg 1p mixture had the lowest heavy metal removal efficiencies therefore 5lg 1p was selected as the best mixture and was taken as a control in experiment 2 in experiment 2 both mixtures performed excellently and the re values were very similar between the two rain events table 3 all the re values approached 100 except that the zn removal efficiency by 5g 10lg 3p was slightly lower than 98 from the 1st day to 2nd day rain event the zn removal by 5sg 10lg 3p decreased slightly in general after replacing 1 3 limestone gravel in the 5lg 1p mixture with silica gravel the newly formed mixture 5sg 10lg 3p kept the high removal efficiencies of cd and pb but slightly lower removal efficiency of zn compared with the 5lg 1p mixture thus we would recommend the 5sg 10lg 3p mixture if long term use would be most required because silica gravel was cheaper and more physical chemically stable than limestone gravel 3 2 effectiveness of the gravel peat infiltration filters the heavy metal removal efficiencies re of our gravel peat filters were compared with the reported values in the literature table 4 according to the literature the sphagnum peat moss has the highest heavy metal removal efficiencies cd 99 1 pb 99 4 and zn 99 6 while stormwater biofilter infiltration trench and soakaway also have quite high heavy metal removal efficiencies comparison of table 3 and table 4 shows that the gravel peat filters have higher heavy metal removal efficiencies than all the facilities listed in table 4 it should be noted that the influent heavy metal concentration values in those studies are generally much lower than those in this research experiment scale is also a likely factor of influencing the heavy metal re 3 3 possible factors influencing heavy metal removal efficiency many factors can influence the heavy metal removal efficiency re in this experiment such as ph condition peat fraction hydraulic conductivity moisture content of mixtures and redistribution of mixture due to stormwater flow 3 3 1 ph condition and peat fraction peat fraction and ph condition were the primary factors that influenced the heavy metal removal efficiency in experiment 1 among the four types of media 2lg 1p mixture had the lowest re which could be mainly caused by its highest peat fraction and thus lowest ph value and the other three had similar res which might be due to their similar ph values this suggests that adding peat into limestone gravel could reduce the cost of materials without causing obviously decrease in heavy metal re in experiment 2 the higher zinc re of the 5sg 10lg 3p mixture than that of the 5lg 1p mixture indicates zinc re was affected by ph via the alkalinity of limestone gravel also due to the alkalinity of limestone gravel all the stormwater effluents had slightly higher ph ph 8 2 0 2 t 24 8 0 8 c than that of the stormwater influents ph 7 7 t 25 8 c 3 3 2 moisture content of filter media the absorbing ability of a medium mainly depends on the volume of peat contained and the pores between grains the larger volumes of peat and pores the more stormwater can be absorbed and the higher potential of absorbing heavy metals from stormwater for example effluent volume from dry media ranges from 314 ml to 525 ml was much lower than the influent volume 977 ml but decreased with the peat fraction the wet media only retained 20 stormwater from the 2nd day rain event in experiment 2 which likely contributed to the decrease in zinc re by the 5sg 10lg 1p mixture 3 3 3 other factors other possible factors influencing the heavy metal removal efficiency include hydraulic conductivity gravel peat mixing and slight redistribution of mixture via stormwater flow for example the mixing of gravel and peat was not strictly even and the mixture volume was often smaller than original inputs due to the poor stability of peat which affected the pore volume in the mixture 3 4 water quality assessment it may be of interest to assess how good the stormwater quality became after being treated by our infiltration filters according to groundwater quality standards as an example we assessed the stormwater quality according to the national groundwater quality standards in china quality standard for ground water gb t 14848 93 and poland journal of laws of 2001 no 115 item 1229 the result table 5 shows that all the stormwater effluents have drinking water quality class i iii which is safe for groundwater recharge 4 perspectives on the integration with good urban design 4 1 proposed field designs to promote the installation of gravel peat infiltration filters we proposed two multi functional field designs which adopted the concepts of treatment train and good urban design li 2012 the objective was to effectively collect and treat stormwater as close as where it falls and to integrate the infiltration filter with local landscape characteristics one example is a hand shape design which indicates that the gravel peat infiltration filter shall hold all the stormwater runoff from the targeted impervious area see fig 2 stormwater runoff flows through four concave grassy slopes fingers into the gravel peat filter surrounded by cobbles and a grassy area palm people can walk through the pervious pavement thumb to maintain the infiltration filter palm centre or to water the flower belt palm fringe for recreational use grass cobbles and pervious pavements can trap sediments slow down runoff velocity and promote stormwater infiltration before stormwater enters the infiltration filter for further treatment the elevation decreases from the outside to the inside which helps accumulate stormwater runoff into the infiltration filter the other example is a round dance floor shape design see fig 3 because it looks like an open round dance floor with grassy surfaces stormwater runoff flows through a series of grassy stairs into a grassy bottom at the centre of the dance floor the gravel peat infiltration filter was installed and surrounded by cobbles the grassy stairs grassy surfaces and cobbles can trap trash and sediments and reduce stormwater runoff during dry periods this system can act as an open dance floor after protecting the infiltration filter with an impervious steel cover on the top 4 2 suggestions on the installation to install these gravel peat infiltration filters a number of factors need to be considered including local hydrogeological geomorphological and hydrological features land availability and public needs these considerations are important for identifying the required infiltration filter volume and developing suitable filed designs we provide some suggestions for the installation of the gravel peat infiltration filter according to the following three situations fig 4 the first situation is when local soil has poor permeability much lower than the infiltration filter and there are wells nearby a thick layer of sand with good permeability and a geotextile layer can be added at the infiltration filter bottom and then the filter can be installed above the groundwater table the second situation is when soil has poor permeability much lower than the gravel peat infiltration filter and there are no wells nearby the filter can be directly installed above the groundwater table the third situation is when soil has good permeability close to or better than the gravel peat infiltration filter the infiltration filter is suggested to be installed above the groundwater table with a thick soil layer in between to separate the infiltration filter from the groundwater table since infiltration rate is the product of saturated hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient the infiltration rate of a gravel peat filter with a certain medium depends on the hydraulic gradient therefore it should be taken into account that increase in the groundwater table will cause decrease in the hydraulic gradient to less than 1 especially in the second situation however a slight rise of groundwater table may have little impact on the hydraulic gradient in the first and third situation decrease in the hydraulic gradient will reduce the infiltration rate but will not affect the final infiltration rate as long as the groundwater table has not yet reached the filter bottom hydraulic gradient 1 another problem is groundwater mounding if it is close to the filter the hydraulic gradient will be significantly reduced to less than 1 and the final infiltration rate will be much lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity massman 2003 therefore this issue should be well considered while installing a gravel peat infiltration filter in the field an example of the installation of a gravel peat infiltration filter is shown in fig 5 which is the third situation described above soil has good permeability the elevation decreases from the grassy area to the filter to help stormwater flow into the filter in order to conveniently operate and maintain the filter especially when the filter materials need to be renewed a pipe with a larger size than the filter can be installed around the filter when there is a need the filter can be directly taken out while leaving behind the outside pipe inside the soil to maintain the soil structure and the space for the coming filter according to our darcy s experiments hydraulic conductivity of a gravel peat infiltration filter especially the top part of the medium is sensitive to external forces thus to protect the filter from external forces a pervious steel cover could be added above the top geotextile layer with a small space in between which also helps evenly distribute stormwater over the filter surface after flowing through the gravel peat infiltration filter and the soil layer stormwater reaches groundwater body long term recharge of groundwater helps increase groundwater level and thus counteracts the negative effects of groundwater over exploitation 5 conclusions and further research in general the evidence and potential of the gravel peat infiltration filters have been demonstrated through our laboratory experiment to conclude all of the tested filter media had very high heavy metal removal efficiency re 95 44 among others the 5lg 1p mixture had the highest heavy metal removal efficiency 99 6 100 and high peat fraction peat was cheaper than gravel and thus was a good candidate to be implemented in the field the 5sg 10lg 1p mixture formed by replacing one third of the limestone gravel in the 5lg 1p mixture with silica gravel kept the high cd and pb removal efficiencies 99 2 99 9 but had a little bit lower zn removal efficiency 95 4 97 9 thus if a longer term use is most required the 5sg 10lg 1p mixture was recommended for implementation due to its higher physical chemical stability the most convenient filter media of high heavy metal re is limestone gravel alone which is however the most expensive choice we also provided two field design examples to demonstrate the integration of gravel peat infiltration filters with good urban design and treatment train concepts some suggestions were also provided for installing these infiltration filters in the field further research is required to promote a substantive implementation of such gravel peat infiltration filters at the laboratory scale this may include comprehensive measurements of hydraulic conductivity under various pressures and long term performance experiments under rainfall events of various sizes at the field scale this may include the infiltration rate measurement the long term monitoring of the removal efficiencies of heavy metals and other pollutants and the assessment of the filter resistance to clogging in addition the layered structure and mixed structure could be compared regarding their resistance to clogging

1009,the formerly perennial katuma river in western tanzania starts in a protected forest it then flows through irrigated rice farms before reaching lake katavi a floodplain wetland whose outflow regulates the river flow through the katavi national park knp down to its outlet at lake rukwa which has no outlet in recent years due to overexploitation of water for irrigation the katuma river dried out for up to four months per year and this greatly degraded the knp ecosystem the siltation of river lead to flooding of the adjacent areas during heavy rains and the water level of lake rukwa has decreased by 4 m since 1992 while its fishery yield and water quality also deteriorated in 2016 a total of 46 illegal weirs were removed from the katuma river upstream of knp following that the river zero flow periods were reduced by two months and lake rukwa water level rose by 1 m we suggest that the construction of a low v notch weir at the outlet of the lake katavi wetlands would further reduce the katuma river zero flow periods by an additional month thus returning the river nearly to its former perennial status the enforcement of regulations governing the construction of irrigation weirs is essential these ecohydrology solutions do not eliminate the threats but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale this example of active governance of water resources at the basin scale can be applied throughout tanzania and in semi arid east africa in general keywords satellite altimetry river gauging rating curve water budget sustainability 1 introduction the african human population is projected to increase by about 1 3 billion from 2017 to 2050 and almost half of this increase will occur in sub sahara africa un desa 2017 increasing human population and associated freshwater demands pose a major threat to freshwater resources and biodiversity in sub saharan africa unep 2006 jury and vaux 2007 un desa 2017 in sub saharan africa surface water abstractions are often affected by dams weirs and diversions which range from small to large scale and these are geared towards meeting the high food and energy needs of a fast growing human population unep 2010 lehner et al 2011 as human needs increase so does abstraction of water whose practice is often unsustainable and consequently leads to freshwater problems and associated conflicts between people in upstream and downstream areas this is already the case in much of semi arid east africa crisman et al 2003 there are numerous such examples some resulting in upstream winners and downstream losers a case where the upstream users enjoy extracting all most of the water while leaving nothing little to the downstream users such situation also causes human wildlife conflicts for example gichuki 2002 documented illegal abstraction of water for irrigation farming in the upper ewaso ng iro river in kenya that extracted up to 80 of the available water in the upstream areas during the dry season resulting in the lowlands in a marked water scarcity affecting both people and wildlife and leading to human wildlife conflicts that resulted in the killing of wild animals as another example the overharvesting of freshwater for rice irrigation in the historically perennial upper great ruaha river in tanzania has resulted in drying up the lower reaches of the river for typically three months a year with severe human and ecological impacts kihwele et al 2012 2018 mtahiko et al 2006 tanzania is severely affected by the developing water crisis due to the lack of or weak non existent governance of water resources elisa et al 2010 kabote and john 2017 kihwele et al 2012 kiwango et al 2015 in spite of the regulations relating to water resource use and conservation improved governance countrywide at the river catchment scale is needed seeteram et al 2019 this paper focuses on the katuma river in the lake rukwa drainage basin figure 1 a this river is the key source of water for wildlife in katavi national park knp in the dry season and this wildlife is abundant with thousands of buffalo elephant impala zebra eland giraffe sable and hundreds of hippo wcs 2019 the katuma river is the main river draining into knp and lake rukwa which has no outlet and supports an important artisanal fisheries and communities along its shore the human population growth rate in the river basin is 3 8 per annum which is well above the 2 9 per annum national average urt 2014 and this is largely attributable to a high influx of people from other regions of western tanzania their main socio economic activity is farming and livestock keeping silangwa 2016 salerno et al 2017 a severe water crisis is developing in the river basin because of the excessive use of katuma river for rice irrigation upstream of knp figure 1 in 2014 irrigation accounted for about 80 of all water consumed in the entire river basin urt 2014 and this lead to the former perennial katuma river drying up for up to four months a year the irrigation area generates winners and losers the winners are the irrigators in the upstream areas the losers are knp and its wildlife as well as the fishermen and cattlemen living downstream of knp and around lake rukwa elisa et al 2010 lrbwb 2016 lake rukwa faces a crisis due to a rapidly growing human population overfishing polluted agricultural and mining runoff siltation from erosion upland from deforestation overgrazing and poor agricultural practices decreasing river inflows and decreasing water levels indeed it has been predicted that the lake could further shrink and even disappear altogether in the next few decades down to earth 2017 iucn netherlands 2017 lakepedia 2017 ipp media 2018 nasa earth observatory 2019 this paper describes how solutions to this water crisis are being sought following the ecohydrology principles described by zalewski 2002 2011 first monitoring and research was carried out to demonstrate the link between hydrological and biological processes at the catchment scale e g the key role of water in sustaining wildlife in knp and in maintaining lake rukwa and the human impact in degrading that system by withdrawing water from the natural system second an effort was made to restore the basin ecosystem absorbing capacity by removing 46 illegal weirs and restoring the river channel in the irrigated areas upstream of knp knp 2016 by late 2019 about 20 illegal weirs were already re built for irrigation farming upstream of knp these weirs were later removed in the same year third initiatives are underway to use the ecosystem properties as a management tool e g by designing a low level v notch weir to extend the river outflow from the upstream wetland lake katavi in order to diminish the period of no flow in the river those initiatives do not eliminate the threats posed by the water crisis but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale this paper does this by describing the results of a water budget evaluation focusing on katuma river flow and its regulation by lake katavi which is misnamed as it is a floodplain wetland and on lake rukwa figure 1a b c we used a combination of data obtained from satellite altimetry field hydrological study and modelling to obtain a time series of the flows in the katuma river and the water level in lake katavi from 2013 to 2019 this enabled us to quantify both their seasonal and inter annual water variability the key role of lake katavi in regulating the flow in the river and the relative importance of interannual fluctuations in rainfall and the abstraction of water for paddy irrigation 2 methods 2 1 study area the katuma river figure 1 originates from the forested mpanda mwese ranges where the river flow is perennial meyer et al 2005 the river then flows through village lands i e land used for settlement and farming to reach the floodplains upstream of knp where water is used for irrigating rice paddies as an intensive cash crop that returns no flow to the river the impact of irrigation is so great that river flow downstream of the farms ceases in the dry season and which has generated a major crisis both for people and the environment elisa et al 2010 the outflow from the irrigation areas discharges into lake katavi the outflow from this lake flows through katavi national park where it supplies water to the ecologically important katisunga and chada floodplain wetlands on exiting lake chada the river now called the kavuu figure 1a flows southwards marking the western boundary between knp the rgr and village lands the kavuu river finally discharges into lake rukwa which has no outlet 2 2 meteorological data the katavi ecosystem is generally under single wet season that starts from late november or early december and lasts until june elisa et al 2010 the hydrological year in the region is thus taken to start in july and to end in june of the following year to examine the influence of rainfall and evaporation on surface water variability we obtained from katavi national park and the tanzania meteorological agency the annual rainfall data from sitalike in knp from 1997 to 2019 kigoma and sumbawanga from 1989 to 2019 and mpanda from 2011 to 2019 in addition class a evaporation data were obtained from the tanzania meteorological agency in mpanda 2 3 hydrology data we used 3 years 2013 2016 of altimetry data from the isro cnes saral mission esa 2016 specifically the saral elevation data acquired along the satellite s nadir ground track descending satellite pass no 035 running north east to south west that crossed over an eastern section of lake katavi elevation data acquired over a 1 km stretch from 6 695 os 31 0232 oe to 6 6850 os 31 0256 oe was averaged to form a mean value for each satellite overpass which repeated every 35 days in general time series of such altimetry height variations have been found to be accurate to 5 20 cm r m s when compared to a series of in situ gauge measurements birkett 1995 birkett and beckley 2010 we also conducted a bathymetry survey in lake katavi along the satellite track in the wet season to obtain a datum and then referred the altimetry data to that datum we deployed a hobo water level logger model u20 001 01 onset 2020 in lake katavi along the satellite track to obtain the water level at hourly intervals from the end of 2016 to the end of 2019 we also referred the data to the same datum data recovery was 100 using a mfp126 s geopack advanced stream flow meter and river gauging methodology we measured the katuma river discharge at sitalike located about 20 km downstream from the outlet of lake katavi and two more upstream sites at nkungwi iloba and katuma villages figure 1a we used the katuma river discharge data at sitalike and the lake level data to generate a rating curve i e a relationship between the lake water level and the river discharge the river channel distance between the outlet of lake katavi upstream and sitalike downstream is short about 20 km and is pristine with no human interference thus contributing to the reliability of the relationship between river discharge and lake levels dhv consultants bv delft hydraulics 1999 using that rating curve and the river gauging data at sitalike we calculated the water level at the time of these measurements we obtained a time series data set of both lake levels and river discharges from 2013 to 2019 with no gaps in the data we collected google earth satellite images of the irrigated areas from which we measured their surface area and their evolution per year from 1984 when they first started to 2019 we also measured the lake surface area from all available landsat cloud free images from 2012 to 2017 we derived a relationship between the lake surface area and the water level lake katavi is characterised by gently sloping sides and thus changes in water level in the lakes lead to a rapid change in surface area benson and paillet 1989 distinguishing between human induced and natural variability on water level was not important a priori in establishing the relationship between lake surface area and water level however data on climate variables and river gauging at several stations were used to establish the human induced impact on water budget using the rainfall data at sitalike mpanda kigoma and sumbawanga and the evaporation data at mpanda we calculated the rainfall on and the evaporation rate from lake katavi and from the irrigated areas multiplying those rates by the surface areas we calculated the daily changes in the water volumes we obtained the mean water level for lake rukwa for the period 1992 2019 at 10 day resolution from the nasa topex jason mission series courtesy of the usda global reservoir and lake monitor usda 2020 2 4 water budget calculations we calculated the water budget of lake katavi from the mass balance equation 1 dv dt inflow

outflow evaporation from the surface area of lake katavi katuma river flow in eq 1 all the parameters are known from measurements except the river inflow from upstream the river inflow can thus be calculated we calculated the water budget for each year there are some possible errors in that model because class a pan evaporation data may overestimate the actual evaporation from open water in hot and windy weather chu et al 2010 and wetlands plants may either increase the evaporation rate by evapotranspiration and increasing the surface roughness or decrease the evaporation rate by shading and protecting it from the wind acreman et al 2003 kihwele et al 2012 there are no local data to estimate this effect in katavi as the irrigators do not release any water to the system the loss of water q flowing to lake katavi from irrigation was calculated as the water that used to run out to lake katavi from the area before it was farmed following the classical rainfall runoff formula lmno engineering 2015a 4 q cia where c 0 1 is the runoff coefficient i is the rainfall intensity and a is the drainage area 2 5 preliminary design of an engineering structure we measured the bathymetry at the outlet of lake katavi using that data we proposed to the knp management to build a small v notch weir at that site the aim is to reduce the wet season outflow from lake katavi thus storing more water for a subsequent release during the dry season we estimated the resulting extension of the dry season flow of the katuma river using the hydrodynamic model of kihwele et al 2018 this model calculates the daily change in the wetland water level upstream of the weir from the river inflow the rainfall the evaporation and the outflow over the weir that was calculated using standard hydraulic engineering formulae lmno engineering 2015b 3 results 3 1 rainfall the annual rainfall had a large interannnual variability while decreasing at 3 6 mm year figure 2 and a similar pattern occurred not shown at all the other rainfall stations where the data sets are shorter and thus the trends are less reliable the mean annual rainfall is 927 mm and the annual rainfall from 2016 to 2019 was on average 78 mm 8 4 below this mean 3 2 evaporation during the study period the annual evaporation rate in the katavi ecosystem ranged from almost 2010 mm to 2280 mm figure 3 a 3 3 growth of the irrigated areas and water use there was no irrigation farming up to 1984 the irrigated area was about 3 km2 in 1989 figure 3b until the early 2000s the area under irrigation farming remained small from that time the area under irrigation increased rapidly to reach almost 500 km2 in 2019 this water use is mainly for rice irrigation water is abstracted from the river using illegal weirs that divert water to the farms through non returning channels at one site the whole river was diverted and at other sites the river was completely blocked by weirs until these obstructions were removed in late 2016 the irrigated fields also retain all the rainwater that would have previously flowed to the katuma river figure 3c assuming a runoff coefficient of 0 1 in eq 4 10 of that water would have flown to lake katavi if there were no irrigation in the presence of irrigation for 2017 this implies a yearly averaged loss of inflow to lake katavi of 2 3 m3 s 1 compared to a yearly averaged river inflow to lake katavi in 2017 as calculated from eq 1 of 9 3 m3 s 1 i e 25 assuming an irrigation flow similar to that of the rice farms of usangu in tanzania with a similar climate and rice farming techniques the irrigation inflow in addition to rainfall would be 2 3 m3 s 1 so that in 2017 the inflow to lake katavi was reduced in total by 50 by irrigation 3 4 river discharge the daily river discharge varied substantially with a minimum of 0 in the dry season july october and a maximum of 30 m3 s in the wet season november june figure 4 a there was also a large inter annual variability the discharge at any given year of the katuma river is strongly influenced by the amount of rainfall which results in a high discharge in years of high rainfall and a small discharge in years of low rainfall the highest river discharge reached in the hydrological years 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 was about 25 m3 s while the highest in the 2016 2017 and 2018 2019 was about 30 m3 s in most cases the river discharge peaked from november december to april of the following year which corresponds to hydrological year july june in the katavi ecosystem we found that the inter annual variability in discharge corresponded well with the inter annual rainfall variability however that was not the case for the dry season of 2017 and 2018 as the removal of the illegal weirs and river channel restoration in late 2016 substantially reduced the duration of the zero flow period during the dry season figure 4a 3 5 lake katavi water level the water level varied from 0 m in the dry season to almost 3 0 m at the peak of the wet season figure 4b indeed very little scatter was found in this rating curve figure 5 a a relationship between the lake level and the lake surface area was also obtained figure 5b this has some scatter but the relationship is sufficiently robust r2 0 71 the lake surface area reached its largest value in 2016 2017 of about 60 km2 3 6 lake rukwa water level the water level of lake rukwa has decreased by almost 4 m since 1992 figure 6 coinciding with the expansion of irrigation upstream of knp figure 3b that took water out of the river system the fastest rates of decrease of the lake level occurred since the early 2000s following the removal of illegal weirs upstream of knp in late 2016 the lake water level increased by about 1 m 3 7 impact on the river flow following removal and re establishment of weirs the hydrologic data from 2013 to 2019 are shown in table 1 it is apparent that 2016 2017 had below average rainfall and above average evaporation yet it had almost double the average river discharge it is evident from table 2 that the katuma river inflow into and outflow from lake katavi varied across the time since 2013 and that the removal of weirs reduced the no flow period downstream of lake katavi by two months 4 discussion there is no clear evidence of climate change in the rainfall and evaporation data during the study period the annual evaporation rate in the katavi ecosystem ranged from about 2010 mm to 2280 mm while the common potential evaporation rate in east africa ranges between 1800 mm to 2200 mm per year dagg et al 1970 for the last 30 years the annual rainfall has decreased by 3 6 mm year but this trend is statistically insignificant r2 0 076 because of the large inter annual variability the floodplain wetland that is lake katavi plays a major role in regulating the flow in the katuma river as shown in the relationship between lake level and river discharge there is a relationship between the lake level and the lake surface area as shown in figure 5b this has some scatter which is largely due to the difficulty in differentiating between wet and dry areas in the googleearth images because of the extensive green fringing vegetation there are also some outliers which might have resulted in errors originating from limitations in clearly isolating a variety of water surfaces spectral signatures ultimately culminating in the misclassifications of satellite images busker et al 2019 however the relationship is sufficiently robust r2 0 71 to justify using the resulting equation to calculate the annual volume of lake katavi the increase in river discharge despite the low rainfall and high evaporation table 1 is an indication that excessive abstraction and weirs along the river upstream of knp were responsible for a low flow and drying up of the river during the dry season low discharges in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were likely due to abstraction of water for irrigation farming and lower rainfall during these years however difference in annual rainfall does not seem to be the only variable explaining for the disparity in discharge between years as some years received relatively high rainfall but did not record equivalent high discharges these disparities in discharges are rather explained by other factors especially different levels of water abstraction for irrigation farming in the upstream areas elisa et al 2010 for instance year 2012 2013 received the highest amount of rainfall but recorded a relatively low discharge whereas 2016 2017 received below average rainfall but recorded the highest river discharge table 1 figure 4a this high discharge in 2016 2017 was mainly attributed to the removal of many of the abstraction weirs in the upstream katuma river which allowed much more water to flow downstream unlike in 2012 2013 in which no water abstraction weirs were removed in the upstream areas knp 2017 on the other hand because of the illegal irrigation dams 2015 2016 recorded one of the lowest discharges and received the lowest amount of rainfall it can therefore be concluded that the impact of removing these illegal weirs blocking the river in late 2016 was the extension of the flow in the river in knp by about 2 3 months in 2017 and 2018 table 2 even though the rainfall was lower and the evaporation was higher than in previous years for instance for the same peak discharge in the wet season in 2016 and 2018 the katuma river stopped flowing for about 117 days in 2016 when the illegal weirs were present and for about 60 days in 2018 when the illegal weirs had been removed this clearly shows the success of removing the illegal weirs the worsening situation in 2019 figure 4a is likely caused by the recent re establishment of about 20 illegal weirs for irrigation farming upstream of knp knp 2019 these weirs were later removed and this contributed to the improvement of the downstream katuma river flow which has not ceased in 2020 personal communication with knp ecologist the impact of excessive water abstraction is further reflected in the water level of lake rukwa the fastest rates of decrease of the lake level occurred as irrigation was ramped up in the early 2000s a new quasi steady state was reached for the lake in recent years due to the smaller lake area resulting in a less loss of water from evaporation the correlation between irrigation and the lake water level is highlighted by the fact that the removal of illegal weirs in late 2016 was followed by an increase of the lake rukwa water level by about 1 m figure 6 to restore perennial flow in the katuma river we propose that tanzania national parks tanapa should construct a small v notch weir at the outlet of lake katavi where the katauma river exits the lake the model of kihwele et al 2018 suggests that the weir will extend the flow in the katuma river by about 1 month by decreasing the outflow during the wet season thus temporarily storing this water in lake katavi and releasing this water slowly in the dry season the weir is to be built over the river bed its crest should be horizontal with a maximum height of 1 5 m over the river bed in the thalweg and the height of the weir decreases towards the river banks as the land rises on either side of the thalweg figure 7 from our bathymetry data the width would span 80 m it would have concrete apron to protect the base from overflow erosion 5 conclusion and recommendations this paper quantifies the flow regulating ecosystem service at the basin scale provided by the floodplain wetland that is lake katavi it does this by 1 estimating the water budget of lake katavi and the katuma river 2 quantifying the impacts of paddy irrigation farming on the katuma river and lakes katavi and rukwa 3 estimating that removing the illegal weirs and river channel reclamation in 2016 upstream of knp explains the shortening by about 2 months of the zero flow periods in the river 4 quantifying the impact on river flow of the re establishment of illegal weirs in 2019 on increasing again the zero flow period 5 recommending an additional engineering solution to help restore perennial flow in the river water abstraction from illegal weirs has been observed in other rivers in sub saharan africa gaylard et al 2003 conway et al 2009 taylor eta al 2009 tanzania water resource governance is inadequate and often non existent in practice kabote and john 2017 several rivers that were historically perennial are now drying out or have dried out in the dry season mainly due to unregulated irrigation in upstream areas so the katuma river is not an exception elisa et al 2010 this creates conflicts between the winners located upstream and the losers located downstream there are two cases however where the government has attempted to manage these conflicts the first was the removal in 2006 of 1 million herd of cattle that were illegally introduced and were destroying the usangu wetlands these wetlands were the only source of water for the great ruaha river and the removal of the cattle reduced the zero flow periods in the river by 1 2 months kihwele et al 2012 the second case is in the katuma river upstream of knp this study what is novel is that solutions to the water crisis are sought by following the ecohydrology principles described by zalewski 2002 2011 first we used research to understand the biophysics and the human impact at the catchment scale second an effort was made to restore the basin natural water cycle by removing illegal weirs third as described above we propose to enhance the ecosystem properties by constructing a low level v notch weir at the outlet of lake katavi wetlands to ensure sustainability of the katuma river and lake rukwa we recommend 1 the annual removal of the illegal weirs and unregulated water abstraction points in the irrigation areas upstream of knp 2 an enhanced protection of the mpanda mwese forest that is the source of the river flow in the dry season 3 the construction of a small v notch weir at the outlet of the lake katavi floodplain wetland which will decrease the river zero flow period this example of active governance of water resources of a whole ecosystem can be applied throughout tanzania and in semi arid east africa in general declaration of competing interest authors have no any conflict of interest in this work acknowledgements we would like to express our gratitude to the british ecological society bes for funding the field work for this study further we also extend special thanks to the management of katavi national park in particular mr stephano msumi mr benedict mbuya and mr shwahibu massawe for their support during this study 
1009,the formerly perennial katuma river in western tanzania starts in a protected forest it then flows through irrigated rice farms before reaching lake katavi a floodplain wetland whose outflow regulates the river flow through the katavi national park knp down to its outlet at lake rukwa which has no outlet in recent years due to overexploitation of water for irrigation the katuma river dried out for up to four months per year and this greatly degraded the knp ecosystem the siltation of river lead to flooding of the adjacent areas during heavy rains and the water level of lake rukwa has decreased by 4 m since 1992 while its fishery yield and water quality also deteriorated in 2016 a total of 46 illegal weirs were removed from the katuma river upstream of knp following that the river zero flow periods were reduced by two months and lake rukwa water level rose by 1 m we suggest that the construction of a low v notch weir at the outlet of the lake katavi wetlands would further reduce the katuma river zero flow periods by an additional month thus returning the river nearly to its former perennial status the enforcement of regulations governing the construction of irrigation weirs is essential these ecohydrology solutions do not eliminate the threats but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale this example of active governance of water resources at the basin scale can be applied throughout tanzania and in semi arid east africa in general keywords satellite altimetry river gauging rating curve water budget sustainability 1 introduction the african human population is projected to increase by about 1 3 billion from 2017 to 2050 and almost half of this increase will occur in sub sahara africa un desa 2017 increasing human population and associated freshwater demands pose a major threat to freshwater resources and biodiversity in sub saharan africa unep 2006 jury and vaux 2007 un desa 2017 in sub saharan africa surface water abstractions are often affected by dams weirs and diversions which range from small to large scale and these are geared towards meeting the high food and energy needs of a fast growing human population unep 2010 lehner et al 2011 as human needs increase so does abstraction of water whose practice is often unsustainable and consequently leads to freshwater problems and associated conflicts between people in upstream and downstream areas this is already the case in much of semi arid east africa crisman et al 2003 there are numerous such examples some resulting in upstream winners and downstream losers a case where the upstream users enjoy extracting all most of the water while leaving nothing little to the downstream users such situation also causes human wildlife conflicts for example gichuki 2002 documented illegal abstraction of water for irrigation farming in the upper ewaso ng iro river in kenya that extracted up to 80 of the available water in the upstream areas during the dry season resulting in the lowlands in a marked water scarcity affecting both people and wildlife and leading to human wildlife conflicts that resulted in the killing of wild animals as another example the overharvesting of freshwater for rice irrigation in the historically perennial upper great ruaha river in tanzania has resulted in drying up the lower reaches of the river for typically three months a year with severe human and ecological impacts kihwele et al 2012 2018 mtahiko et al 2006 tanzania is severely affected by the developing water crisis due to the lack of or weak non existent governance of water resources elisa et al 2010 kabote and john 2017 kihwele et al 2012 kiwango et al 2015 in spite of the regulations relating to water resource use and conservation improved governance countrywide at the river catchment scale is needed seeteram et al 2019 this paper focuses on the katuma river in the lake rukwa drainage basin figure 1 a this river is the key source of water for wildlife in katavi national park knp in the dry season and this wildlife is abundant with thousands of buffalo elephant impala zebra eland giraffe sable and hundreds of hippo wcs 2019 the katuma river is the main river draining into knp and lake rukwa which has no outlet and supports an important artisanal fisheries and communities along its shore the human population growth rate in the river basin is 3 8 per annum which is well above the 2 9 per annum national average urt 2014 and this is largely attributable to a high influx of people from other regions of western tanzania their main socio economic activity is farming and livestock keeping silangwa 2016 salerno et al 2017 a severe water crisis is developing in the river basin because of the excessive use of katuma river for rice irrigation upstream of knp figure 1 in 2014 irrigation accounted for about 80 of all water consumed in the entire river basin urt 2014 and this lead to the former perennial katuma river drying up for up to four months a year the irrigation area generates winners and losers the winners are the irrigators in the upstream areas the losers are knp and its wildlife as well as the fishermen and cattlemen living downstream of knp and around lake rukwa elisa et al 2010 lrbwb 2016 lake rukwa faces a crisis due to a rapidly growing human population overfishing polluted agricultural and mining runoff siltation from erosion upland from deforestation overgrazing and poor agricultural practices decreasing river inflows and decreasing water levels indeed it has been predicted that the lake could further shrink and even disappear altogether in the next few decades down to earth 2017 iucn netherlands 2017 lakepedia 2017 ipp media 2018 nasa earth observatory 2019 this paper describes how solutions to this water crisis are being sought following the ecohydrology principles described by zalewski 2002 2011 first monitoring and research was carried out to demonstrate the link between hydrological and biological processes at the catchment scale e g the key role of water in sustaining wildlife in knp and in maintaining lake rukwa and the human impact in degrading that system by withdrawing water from the natural system second an effort was made to restore the basin ecosystem absorbing capacity by removing 46 illegal weirs and restoring the river channel in the irrigated areas upstream of knp knp 2016 by late 2019 about 20 illegal weirs were already re built for irrigation farming upstream of knp these weirs were later removed in the same year third initiatives are underway to use the ecosystem properties as a management tool e g by designing a low level v notch weir to extend the river outflow from the upstream wetland lake katavi in order to diminish the period of no flow in the river those initiatives do not eliminate the threats posed by the water crisis but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale this paper does this by describing the results of a water budget evaluation focusing on katuma river flow and its regulation by lake katavi which is misnamed as it is a floodplain wetland and on lake rukwa figure 1a b c we used a combination of data obtained from satellite altimetry field hydrological study and modelling to obtain a time series of the flows in the katuma river and the water level in lake katavi from 2013 to 2019 this enabled us to quantify both their seasonal and inter annual water variability the key role of lake katavi in regulating the flow in the river and the relative importance of interannual fluctuations in rainfall and the abstraction of water for paddy irrigation 2 methods 2 1 study area the katuma river figure 1 originates from the forested mpanda mwese ranges where the river flow is perennial meyer et al 2005 the river then flows through village lands i e land used for settlement and farming to reach the floodplains upstream of knp where water is used for irrigating rice paddies as an intensive cash crop that returns no flow to the river the impact of irrigation is so great that river flow downstream of the farms ceases in the dry season and which has generated a major crisis both for people and the environment elisa et al 2010 the outflow from the irrigation areas discharges into lake katavi the outflow from this lake flows through katavi national park where it supplies water to the ecologically important katisunga and chada floodplain wetlands on exiting lake chada the river now called the kavuu figure 1a flows southwards marking the western boundary between knp the rgr and village lands the kavuu river finally discharges into lake rukwa which has no outlet 2 2 meteorological data the katavi ecosystem is generally under single wet season that starts from late november or early december and lasts until june elisa et al 2010 the hydrological year in the region is thus taken to start in july and to end in june of the following year to examine the influence of rainfall and evaporation on surface water variability we obtained from katavi national park and the tanzania meteorological agency the annual rainfall data from sitalike in knp from 1997 to 2019 kigoma and sumbawanga from 1989 to 2019 and mpanda from 2011 to 2019 in addition class a evaporation data were obtained from the tanzania meteorological agency in mpanda 2 3 hydrology data we used 3 years 2013 2016 of altimetry data from the isro cnes saral mission esa 2016 specifically the saral elevation data acquired along the satellite s nadir ground track descending satellite pass no 035 running north east to south west that crossed over an eastern section of lake katavi elevation data acquired over a 1 km stretch from 6 695 os 31 0232 oe to 6 6850 os 31 0256 oe was averaged to form a mean value for each satellite overpass which repeated every 35 days in general time series of such altimetry height variations have been found to be accurate to 5 20 cm r m s when compared to a series of in situ gauge measurements birkett 1995 birkett and beckley 2010 we also conducted a bathymetry survey in lake katavi along the satellite track in the wet season to obtain a datum and then referred the altimetry data to that datum we deployed a hobo water level logger model u20 001 01 onset 2020 in lake katavi along the satellite track to obtain the water level at hourly intervals from the end of 2016 to the end of 2019 we also referred the data to the same datum data recovery was 100 using a mfp126 s geopack advanced stream flow meter and river gauging methodology we measured the katuma river discharge at sitalike located about 20 km downstream from the outlet of lake katavi and two more upstream sites at nkungwi iloba and katuma villages figure 1a we used the katuma river discharge data at sitalike and the lake level data to generate a rating curve i e a relationship between the lake water level and the river discharge the river channel distance between the outlet of lake katavi upstream and sitalike downstream is short about 20 km and is pristine with no human interference thus contributing to the reliability of the relationship between river discharge and lake levels dhv consultants bv delft hydraulics 1999 using that rating curve and the river gauging data at sitalike we calculated the water level at the time of these measurements we obtained a time series data set of both lake levels and river discharges from 2013 to 2019 with no gaps in the data we collected google earth satellite images of the irrigated areas from which we measured their surface area and their evolution per year from 1984 when they first started to 2019 we also measured the lake surface area from all available landsat cloud free images from 2012 to 2017 we derived a relationship between the lake surface area and the water level lake katavi is characterised by gently sloping sides and thus changes in water level in the lakes lead to a rapid change in surface area benson and paillet 1989 distinguishing between human induced and natural variability on water level was not important a priori in establishing the relationship between lake surface area and water level however data on climate variables and river gauging at several stations were used to establish the human induced impact on water budget using the rainfall data at sitalike mpanda kigoma and sumbawanga and the evaporation data at mpanda we calculated the rainfall on and the evaporation rate from lake katavi and from the irrigated areas multiplying those rates by the surface areas we calculated the daily changes in the water volumes we obtained the mean water level for lake rukwa for the period 1992 2019 at 10 day resolution from the nasa topex jason mission series courtesy of the usda global reservoir and lake monitor usda 2020 2 4 water budget calculations we calculated the water budget of lake katavi from the mass balance equation 1 dv dt inflow

because of the extensive green fringing vegetation there are also some outliers which might have resulted in errors originating from limitations in clearly isolating a variety of water surfaces spectral signatures ultimately culminating in the misclassifications of satellite images busker et al 2019 however the relationship is sufficiently robust r2 0 71 to justify using the resulting equation to calculate the annual volume of lake katavi the increase in river discharge despite the low rainfall and high evaporation table 1 is an indication that excessive abstraction and weirs along the river upstream of knp were responsible for a low flow and drying up of the river during the dry season low discharges in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were likely due to abstraction of water for irrigation farming and lower rainfall during these years however difference in annual rainfall does not seem to be the only variable explaining for the disparity in discharge between years as some years received relatively high rainfall but did not record equivalent high discharges these disparities in discharges are rather explained by other factors especially different levels of water abstraction for irrigation farming in the upstream areas elisa et al 2010 for instance year 2012 2013 received the highest amount of rainfall but recorded a relatively low discharge whereas 2016 2017 received below average rainfall but recorded the highest river discharge table 1 figure 4a this high discharge in 2016 2017 was mainly attributed to the removal of many of the abstraction weirs in the upstream katuma river which allowed much more water to flow downstream unlike in 2012 2013 in which no water abstraction weirs were removed in the upstream areas knp 2017 on the other hand because of the illegal irrigation dams 2015 2016 recorded one of the lowest discharges and received the lowest amount of rainfall it can therefore be concluded that the impact of removing these illegal weirs blocking the river in late 2016 was the extension of the flow in the river in knp by about 2 3 months in 2017 and 2018 table 2 even though the rainfall was lower and the evaporation was higher than in previous years for instance for the same peak discharge in the wet season in 2016 and 2018 the katuma river stopped flowing for about 117 days in 2016 when the illegal weirs were present and for about 60 days in 2018 when the illegal weirs had been removed this clearly shows the success of removing the illegal weirs the worsening situation in 2019 figure 4a is likely caused by the recent re establishment of about 20 illegal weirs for irrigation farming upstream of knp knp 2019 these weirs were later removed and this contributed to the improvement of the downstream katuma river flow which has not ceased in 2020 personal communication with knp ecologist the impact of excessive water abstraction is further reflected in the water level of lake rukwa the fastest rates of decrease of the lake level occurred as irrigation was ramped up in the early 2000s a new quasi steady state was reached for the lake in recent years due to the smaller lake area resulting in a less loss of water from evaporation the correlation between irrigation and the lake water level is highlighted by the fact that the removal of illegal weirs in late 2016 was followed by an increase of the lake rukwa water level by about 1 m figure 6 to restore perennial flow in the katuma river we propose that tanzania national parks tanapa should construct a small v notch weir at the outlet of lake katavi where the katauma river exits the lake the model of kihwele et al 2018 suggests that the weir will extend the flow in the katuma river by about 1 month by decreasing the outflow during the wet season thus temporarily storing this water in lake katavi and releasing this water slowly in the dry season the weir is to be built over the river bed its crest should be horizontal with a maximum height of 1 5 m over the river bed in the thalweg and the height of the weir decreases towards the river banks as the land rises on either side of the thalweg figure 7 from our bathymetry data the width would span 80 m it would have concrete apron to protect the base from overflow erosion 5 conclusion and recommendations this paper quantifies the flow regulating ecosystem service at the basin scale provided by the floodplain wetland that is lake katavi it does this by 1 estimating the water budget of lake katavi and the katuma river 2 quantifying the impacts of paddy irrigation farming on the katuma river and lakes katavi and rukwa 3 estimating that removing the illegal weirs and river channel reclamation in 2016 upstream of knp explains the shortening by about 2 months of the zero flow periods in the river 4 quantifying the impact on river flow of the re establishment of illegal weirs in 2019 on increasing again the zero flow period 5 recommending an additional engineering solution to help restore perennial flow in the river water abstraction from illegal weirs has been observed in other rivers in sub saharan africa gaylard et al 2003 conway et al 2009 taylor eta al 2009 tanzania water resource governance is inadequate and often non existent in practice kabote and john 2017 several rivers that were historically perennial are now drying out or have dried out in the dry season mainly due to unregulated irrigation in upstream areas so the katuma river is not an exception elisa et al 2010 this creates conflicts between the winners located upstream and the losers located downstream there are two cases however where the government has attempted to manage these conflicts the first was the removal in 2006 of 1 million herd of cattle that were illegally introduced and were destroying the usangu wetlands these wetlands were the only source of water for the great ruaha river and the removal of the cattle reduced the zero flow periods in the river by 1 2 months kihwele et al 2012 the second case is in the katuma river upstream of knp this study what is novel is that solutions to the water crisis are sought by following the ecohydrology principles described by zalewski 2002 2011 first we used research to understand the biophysics and the human impact at the catchment scale second an effort was made to restore the basin natural water cycle by removing illegal weirs third as described above we propose to enhance the ecosystem properties by constructing a low level v notch weir at the outlet of lake katavi wetlands to ensure sustainability of the katuma river and lake rukwa we recommend 1 the annual removal of the illegal weirs and unregulated water abstraction points in the irrigation areas upstream of knp 2 an enhanced protection of the mpanda mwese forest that is the source of the river flow in the dry season 3 the construction of a small v notch weir at the outlet of the lake katavi floodplain wetland which will decrease the river zero flow period this example of active governance of water resources of a whole ecosystem can be applied throughout tanzania and in semi arid east africa in general declaration of competing interest authors have no any conflict of interest in this work acknowledgements we would like to express our gratitude to the british ecological society bes for funding the field work for this study further we also extend special thanks to the management of katavi national park in particular mr stephano msumi mr benedict mbuya and mr shwahibu massawe for their support during this study
