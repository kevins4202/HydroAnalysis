this study analyzed the effects of climate warming and increased nutrient loading on algae communities recorded by sedimentary pigments in the changtan reservoir of southeastern china from 1985 to 2015 pigment profiles indicated that cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and cryptophytes were the dominant algae groups during the study period algae biomass increased significantly after 2007 correlated by the mann kendall test with an upswing in nutrient load and rising air temperatures generalized additive model gam analysis demonstrated that total phosphorous was the dominant contributor to algae biomass during the study period accounting for 41 37 43 86 58 91 97 36 and 70 24 of variations in total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass respectively the relative contributions of annual average air temperature to variations in total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass were 10 80 14 02 14 13 24 64 and 17 31 respectively depending strongly on nutrient load in conclusion climate warming and increasing anthropogenic nutrient loading forced phytoplankton dynamics and drove increasing algae biomass in this reservoir

in phytoplankton communities over long time periods mwangi et al 2016 as the relationships between climate change and anthropogenic activities are controlled through complex interactions marieke et al 2013 significant knowledge gaps remain regarding how to separate and quantify their impacts visser et al 2016 distinguishing between the impacts of climate change and human activities can be achieved through empirically based and or processing based methods mwangi et al 2016 for example generalized additive modeling gam a processing based non parametric method was recently used to separate the contributions of nutrient enrichment and climate warming on variations in microbial eukaryotic diversity in two deep lakes within the french alps capo et al 2017 it is hypothesized that climate change and human activities have a synergistic effect on phytoplankton communities and biomass and we designed this study to 1 estimate the preservation condition of fossil pigments by applying stable derivatives and a degradation index 2 determine historical phytoplankton production and communities and 3 use gams to quantify the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on phytoplankton biomass 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sediment sampling the changtan reservoir n 28 30 28 40 e 121 00 121 04 located in taizhou city southeastern china fig 1 was built at 1964 with a water area of 35 5 km2 a mean depth of ca 12 m and a catchment area of 514 km2 the catchment is influenced by a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 17 c and annual average rainfall of 1874 8 mm the reservoir plays an important role in regional socioeconomic development by providing drinking water supply flood control irrigation and electricity generation however it has become mesotrophic due to increasing nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from agricultural fertilizer and livestock farming two sediment cores ct 0 and ct 8 were collected from different locations within the reservoir using a gravity columnar sediment sampler 8 cm in diameter 60 cm length in march 2017 fig 1 the sampling sites were chosen away from reservoir banks stream inlets and the reservoir outlet to diminish any disturbance of the sediment by scouring or re suspension the cores were immediately subsampled at 1 cm intervals and transported to a laboratory in an ice filled cooler all samples were freeze dried in an fd 1a 50 freeze dryer and ground through 100 mesh screens then stored in the dark at 80 c 2 2 sample analysis homogenized freeze dried sediment 1 g was extracted in 3 ml acetone water mixture 95 5 v v the mixture was sonicated in an ice water bath for 15 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm ptfe filter all extracts were stored in the dark at 80 c until analysis an agilent 1200 series high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a diode array detector agilent technologies inc palo alto ca usa was used for pigment analysis a waters

activity in sediment samples was determined by γ rays emitted at 46 5 kev and 352 kev respectively excess 210pb 210pbex activity was obtained by 226ra activity from total 210pb activity using the constant rate of supply crs dating model the standard sample of 210pb was supplied by the institute of atomic energy chinese academy of sciences the average sediment accumulation rate at cores was 0 0451 g cm 2 y 1 2 4 data processing pigment concentration profiles were developed with tilia v 2 0 41 software which used constrained incremental sums of squares cluster analysis coniss for the constrained cluster analysis correlations between sedimentary pigments and nutrients or meteorological factors were analyzed by spearman correlation coefficient spss system v16 0 originpro 8 and sigmaplot 9 0 were used for plotting the figures meteorological data were derived from the cn05 1 grid observation dataset which was constructed by the anomaly approach during interpolation with a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 xu et al 2009 the non parametric mann kendall m k statistical test performed in matlab software r2014a was used to assess the presence of monotonic upward or downward trends in meteorological factors over time toride et al 2018 in this case the null hypothesis meant that no significant monotonic trends were present given a meteorological factor time series x x1 x2 xn the m k test statistic s is given by 1 s i n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where sgn xj xk is the sign function of xj xk the variance of s is calculated as 2 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where m is the number of tied groups and ti is the number of observations in the ith tied group then the normalized statistic is given by 3 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 the null hypothesis would be rejected if the absolute value of z exceeded 1 96 with α 0 05 and vice versa more details on this methodology are given in toride et al 2018 gam analysis is suitable for analysis the impact of human activities and climate change on algae biomass capo et al 2017 gams are nonparametric regression models driven by data rather than predetermined by a priori models gam analysis is an effective method because it can directly assess the nonlinear relationship between a response variable and multiple explanatory variables without any restrictive assumptions the method s general structure is given by 4 g μ β 0 i 1 k s i x i ε where μ is the response variable β 0 is a constant intercept term si xi is the unknown smooth function of explanatory variable xi and ε is the residual the akaike information criterion aic and generalized cross validation gcv score were used to select the predictors and decide on their inclusion in or exclusion from the model mosammam et al 2016 smaller aic values indicated that the model could explain more information with less complexity than a model with larger aic values the gcv criterion was applied to automatically select the parameters of smooth functions with an iterative approach improving the calculation efficiency and helping to determine whether the gcv score decreased when one variable was removed song et al 2015 wood 2017 the sedimentary total phosphorus sed tp and annual average air temperature tem were selected as representative predictor variables while the response variables included the concentrations of sedimentary ββ car zea lut diadino and allo indicating variations in total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and cryptophytes respectively all five gam analyses used the mgcv package in r 3 results and discussion 3 1 pigment preservation and profile distribution sedimentary pigments were influenced by photo and chemical oxidation as well as herbivore grazing pressure before entering the fossil record reuss et al 2005 therefore the absolute concentration of fossil pigments as a credible record of primary productivity depends on how well the pigment is preserved deshpande et al 2014 tse et al 2015 highly labile pigments such as the ubiquitous chl a and fuco diatoms were detected well above limited concentrations fig 2 indicating weak diagenetic processes occurring within the collected cores in addition pheide a and phe a the dominant and most stable chl a degradations can provide insight regarding syn depositional and post depositional environment conditions of sedimentary pigments szymczak żyła et al 2016 the significant correlation between chl a and phe a in the changtan reservoir r 0 844 n 62 p 0 01 table 1 shows that the effect of diagenetic processes on chl a should be weak as a small fraction of chl a degraded to phe a in anoxic hypoxic environment in addition good pigment preservation was indicated by a low ratio of pheopigment a the sum of pheide a and phe a to chl a pheo a chl a this ranged from 1 14 7 60 in ct 0 and 0 84 4 56 at ct 8 sites fig 3 the average pheo a chl a ratios at ct 0 and ct 8 were 4 09 and 2 79 respectively suggesting that preservation conditions were better at ct 8 than ct 0 the ratio of total carotenoid to total identified pigments tcar tpigments was used as an indicator of pigment degradation in sediment reuss et al 2005 this ranged from 0 32 0 50 at ct 0 and 0 33 0 42 at ct 8 fig 3 there was no significant trend in this ratio throughout the core indicating that all sediments underwent the same degradation conditions szymczak żyła et al 2016 overall the sedimentary pigments were preserved adequately enough for us to track the past primary productivity and phytoplankton succession as interpreted from reliable pigment trends all 18 photosynthetic pigment concentrations in sediment cores varied little before the mid 2000s but increased substantially afterward fig 2 which can be attributed to changes in trophic state and primary productivity romero viana et al 2010 the coniss results showed that the greatest difference was observed in core levels before and after the mid 2000s at both sites fig 2 the chl a concentration increased from 0 39 0 15 mean standard deviation and 0 31 0 12 μg pigment g 1 sediment in the first stage to 7 96 1 85 and 3 58 1 59 μg pigment g 1 sediment in the second stage at ct 0 and ct 8 respectively ββ car a better proxy for total algae biomass szymczak żyła et al 2016 increased from 0 16 0 05 and 0 07 0 01 μg pigment g 1 sediment in the first stage to 0 86 0 14 and 0 19 0 06 μg pigment g 1 sediment in the second stage at ct 0 and ct 8 respectively the chl a and ββ car stratigraphy in the sediment cores demonstrated an overall increase in phytoplankton biomass in the past 30 years within two distinct periods 3 2 influence of anthropogenic activities on the phytoplankton community the specific pigment content of the two sediment cores consistently represented the dominant algae community in the changtan reservoir fig 2 the most abundant specific pigments were cantha and zea from cyanobacteria chl b and lutein from green algae diadino diato and fuco mainly from diatoms peri and hex fuco from dinoflagellates and allo from cryptophytes jiménez et al 2015 less abundant pigments included chl c2 minor pigment in red algae mgdvp from prasinoxanthin containing algae neo from mesostigmatophytes and viola from chrysophytes and mesostigmatophytes roy et al 2011 there were significant correlations between many of the pigments including between cantha and zea r 0 934 n 62 p 0 01 table 1 chl b and lutein r 0 918 n 62 p 0 01 and peri and hex fuco r 0 894 n 62 p 0 01 consistent with their known co occurrence in specific algae groups jiménez et al 2015 romero viana et al 2010 the presence of specific phytoplankton pigments throughout the stratigraphic profile indicated that cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and cryptophytes were the dominating algae groups in the changtan reservoir over the past 30 years plankton sampling in 2016 and 2017 from our current work showed that the proportion of cyanobacteria was the largest 33 72 82 47 based on the percentage of phytoplankton abundance in each season the percentages of green algae diatoms and cryptophytes were 8 42 19 23 7 57 39 31 and 0 60 15 09 respectively thus the dominant algae community inferred from sedimentary pigments was consistent with the current algae monitoring data moreover the 2016 and 2017 monitoring data showed that cyanobacteria were the dominant group in summer and autumn 82 47 and 74 89 respectively providing the potential source for algae blooms nitrogen n p and n p ratios in the waterbody are vital elements limiting phytoplankton growth and the principal force driving algae bloom formation szymczak żyła et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 from 1985 to 2015 the sedimentary tn tp and n p ratios increased markedly in the changtan reservoir previous studies have shown that increased n p ratios created p limiting conditions for phytoplankton and favored non n2 fixing cyanobacterium posch et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 spearman correlation analysis of our results indicated that sedimentary nutrient content tn and tp had a statistically strong influence on all pigment concentrations p 0 01 table 1 nonpoint source pollution was the main source of n and p input into the changtan reservoir including surface runoff and discharge from crop and livestock production the total tn emission from point source and non point source is 41 34 t a and 524 31 t a respectively the total tp emission from point source and non point source is 8 89 t a and 90 80 t a respectively among the non point source tn emissions the loss of tn from urban surface runoff was 98 76 t that from farmland runoff was 127 42 t a and that from livestock and poultry was 176 90 t a among the tp emissions the loss of tp from urban surface runoff was 4 48 t that from farmland runoff was 2 81 t a and that from livestock and poultry was 64 13 t a the significant upsurge in algae biomass in the reservoir since the mid 2000s was associated with anthropogenic activities such as increasing agriculture and industrialization as well as urbanization in taizhou city concurrently a serious cyanobacterial bloom occurred over hundreds of square kilometers in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin in may 2007 yang et al 2016 it is noteworthy that nutrients play an important role in phytoplankton biomass increases and algae bloom formation jiménez et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 while climate change e g warming favors the expansion of algae blooms directly or indirectly capo et al 2017 yang et al 2016 3 3 impacts of meteorological factors on the phytoplankton community significant variations in temperature and annual maximum air temperature tmax were observed during the past 30 years at the changtan reservoir p 0 05 temperature tmax and precipitation increased by 1 31 c 2 35 c and 8 36 mm respectively from 1985 to 2016 fig 4 a c the m k test results showed that the progressive rank series of temperature and tmax increased and surpassed the 0 05 confidence level indicating that the temperature and tmax had a statistically significant upward trend from 1985 to 2016 fig 4d e however the progressive and retrograde rank series of precipitation exhibited no significant trend over the past 30 years fig 4f potential trend turning points were estimated when the progressive and retrograde rank series intersected in the confidence interval toride et al 2018 suggesting that the increasing trend of temperature and tmax transited to a stable condition around 1997 and 2003 respectively significantly positive correlations were found between sedimentary pigments and both temperature and tmax at the changtan reservoir n 62 p 0 01 table 1 warming air temperature can heat the epilimnion leading to stronger thermal stratification within lakes kraemer et al 2015 posch et al 2012 which may impede water turnover and affect the compensation of hypolimnetic o2 deficits yang et al 2016 this can directly impact phytoplankton physiology posch et al 2012 potentially leading to taxonomic shifts and biodiversity loss o beirne et al 2017 furthermore the changtan reservoir located in a subtropical lowland region is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events particularly extreme high temperature havens et al 2016 the phytoplankton biomass in the changtan reservoir experienced an unprecedented upsurge in 2007 fig 2 this could be attributed to the extreme high temperature that triggered the multiplication of algae organisms due to sufficient nutrient levels havens et al 2016 posch et al 2012 precipitation influences phytoplankton biomass dynamics due to greater runoff into water bodies toride et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 although no significant correlations were found between sedimentary pigments and precipitation table 1 indirect impacts of rainfall on phytoplankton biomass may have been neglected havens et al 2016 precipitation is plentiful in the study area heavy rainfall may promote the formation of harmful algae blooms due to the re suspension of benthic algae organisms and or increases in primary productivity o beirne et al 2017 yang et al 2016 low wind speed can also be a precondition for harmful algae bloom occurrence by affecting the synthesis of gas vesicles and distribution of algae cells helbling et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the changtan reservoir is strongly influenced by a warm moist air mass and typhoons in july august and september which results in enhancing vertical mixing have a negative influence on algae bloom formation kraemer et al 2015 overall the impact mechanisms of meteorological factors on the phytoplankton community including air temperature precipitation and wind speed are complex interrelated and difficult to separate and quantify mwangi et al 2016 3 4 relative contribution of predictors to the phytoplankton community gam analysis was applied to estimate how and when climate change and anthropogenic activities contributed to variations in phytoplankton biomass capo et al 2017 the contribution of the two predictors sed tp and temperature to the variation of total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass are shown in fig 5 significant correlations p 0 05 were found between the response variables and explanatory variables in all models the adjusted coefficients of determination r2 for the gams were all greater than 0 895 indicating good relationships between the explanatory variables and response variables for all five models the contribution of sed tp increased sharply and was much larger than that of temperature after around 2007 the negative effect of sed tp p 0 001 on response variables changed to a positive effect after 2007 fig 5 these changes were concurrent with a significant increase in algae biomass the changtan reservoir experienced increasing inputs of n p and n p ratio and developed p limiting conditions for phytoplankton accelerating algae growth and promoting primary productivity in the reservoir which was similar with the literatures posch et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 the responses of total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass to temperature p 0 05 were positive since the late 1990s fig 5 the increasing trend s turning point for temperature occurred in 1997 according to the m k test fig 4 consistent with the results above gam simulations indicated that a temperature upsurge would affect algae population dynamics positively due to the enhanced growth rate increased water column stability and extended growing season visser et al 2016 the relative contribution of sed tp to variations in total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass table 2 suggested that tp was a good predictor of phytoplankton biomass the relative contribution of temperature to variations in total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass table 2 suggested that the response of phytoplankton biomass to temperature depends strongly on nutrient load which was consistent with previous study visser et al 2016 a previous study found that cyanobacteria biomass was influenced by nutrients and temperature the nutrients explained a larger proportion of the variation according to data from more than 1000 lakes in the united states marieke et al 2013 research using data from 143 lakes along a latitudinal gradient from europe to south america indicated that at lower nutrient levels the frequency of cyanobacterial occurrence was below 30 over a wide range of water temperatures rising very slowly in contrast at higher nutrient concentrations there was a rapid and nonlinear increase in cyanobacterial biovolume with temperature havens and paerl 2015 paerl and otten 2013 these results showed that the impact of temperature on phytoplankton biomass was slight at low nutrient levels consistent with the current study moreover the influence of nutrients and temperature varied among algae taxa rigosi et al 2014 for instance some taxa such as anabaena responded more strongly to increasing nutrients than rising temperature whereas other taxa such as microcystis were more sensitive to rising temperature rigosi et al 2014 visser et al 2016 the gams explained the variance of diatoms best with sed tp f 212 65 p 0 001 accounting for 97 36 and temperature f 9 12 p 0 01 accounting for 24 64 table 2 diatoms have relatively high growth rates and are generally adapted to low light levels in high nutrient containing water compared with other algae taxa reynolds 2006 winder et al 2009 found that smaller planktonic diatom species are suitable for living in increased nutrients and stratification conditions in lake tahoe california for past decades moreover the diatom assemblage structure can be influenced by confounding factors such as fluctuations in temperature light intensity discharge and grazing pressure lavoie et al 2014 diatoms are sensitive to temperature so lower temperatures can promote diatom growth because their optimal temperature for growth and photosynthesis is around 15 c paerl and otten 2013 considering the broad heterogeneity of morphological and eco physiological traits among diatom species reynolds 2006 the best adaption for diatoms to increasing nutrients and climate warming induced mixing alterations may be species selection winder et al 2009 increases in sediment tp concentration since 2007 have significantly raised the contribution of tp to algae biomass seriously threatening the water quality of the changtan reservoir fig 6 on the other hand as climate change persists the reservoir is likely to become dominated by cyanobacteria and experience algae blooms even without a further rise in nutrient inputs our results imply that a climate driven change in water temperature would modify the phytoplankton community toward those species favoring increased nutrients and higher water temperatures the longer action to control eutrophication is delayed and the more time that climate change is given to develop synergistic effects on nutrients the less likely it becomes that eutrophication control will be achieved havens and paerl 2015 hence climate change should be considered within the context of evolving nutrient mitigation strategies for eutrophication control to maintain the water quality in watersheds such as the changtan reservoir with increasing urbanization many climate change adaptation policies should be explored to mitigate nutrient loading into aquatic environments for example protection and restoration of buffer strips in stream systems provide an effective strategy to moderate temperature regimes and offset warming and protect water quality for downstream ecosystems and water supply areas davies 2010 capon et al 2013 long term management strategies must recognize and account for the fact that meteorological conditions are evolving as climate changes impacting the path of nutrient inputs through watersheds and affecting nutrient loading in water bodies climate induced impacts to hydrological and thermal regimes enhancing algal growth in reservoir systems can be offset through improved management of environmental flow releases from reservoirs arthington et al 2010 poff et al 2010 4 conclusions well preserved sedimentary pigments preserve evidence for changes in primary production over the past thirty years in the changtan reservoir china the dominant phytoplankton groups determined by pigment analysis were cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and cryptophytes consistent with recent observational results for plankton sedimentary pigments recorded a significant upsurge in phytoplankton biomass in the changtan reservoir after 2007 m k statistical tests showed that this was linked to a significant increase in air temperature over the catchment and a disastrous cyanobacterial bloom that occurred in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin in may 2007 increases in anthropogenic nutrients and changes in climate affected phytoplankton dynamics and algae biomass in the reservoir gam analysis demonstrated that nutrient loading explained a larger proportion of algae biomass variation than temperature in addition a significant increase in sed tp had a positive effect on algae biomass from 2007 onward of the species considered variations in diatoms were best explained by gam analysis indicating that diatoms may be the best adapted of the phytoplankton taxonomic groups to warming temperatures and increasing nutrients conflict of interest the authors

constrained cluster analysis correlations between sedimentary pigments and nutrients or meteorological factors were analyzed by spearman correlation coefficient spss system v16 0 originpro 8 and sigmaplot 9 0 were used for plotting the figures meteorological data were derived from the cn05 1 grid observation dataset which was constructed by the anomaly approach during interpolation with a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 xu et al 2009 the non parametric mann kendall m k statistical test performed in matlab software r2014a was used to assess the presence of monotonic upward or downward trends in meteorological factors over time toride et al 2018 in this case the null hypothesis meant that no significant monotonic trends were present given a meteorological factor time series x x1 x2 xn the m k test statistic s is given by 1 s i n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where sgn xj xk is the sign function of xj xk the variance of s is calculated as 2 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i

null hypothesis would be rejected if the absolute value of z exceeded 1 96 with α 0 05 and vice versa more details on this methodology are given in toride et al 2018 gam analysis is suitable for analysis the impact of human activities and climate change on algae biomass capo et al 2017 gams are nonparametric regression models driven by data rather than predetermined by a priori models gam analysis is an effective method because it can directly assess the nonlinear relationship between a response variable and multiple explanatory variables without any restrictive assumptions the method s general structure is given by 4 g μ β 0 i 1 k s i x i ε where μ is the response variable β 0 is a constant intercept term si xi is the unknown smooth function of explanatory variable xi and ε is the residual the akaike information criterion aic and generalized cross validation gcv score were used to select the predictors and decide on their inclusion in or exclusion from the model mosammam et al 2016 smaller aic values indicated that the model could explain more information with less complexity than a model with larger aic values the gcv criterion was applied to automatically select the parameters of smooth functions with an iterative approach improving the calculation efficiency and helping to determine whether the gcv score decreased when one variable was removed song et al 2015 wood 2017 the sedimentary total phosphorus sed tp and annual average air temperature tem were selected as representative predictor variables while the response variables included the concentrations of sedimentary ββ car zea lut diadino and allo indicating variations in total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and cryptophytes respectively all five gam analyses used the mgcv package in r 3 results and discussion 3 1 pigment preservation and profile distribution sedimentary pigments were influenced by photo and chemical oxidation as well as herbivore grazing pressure before entering the fossil record reuss et al 2005 therefore the absolute concentration of fossil pigments as a credible record of primary productivity depends on how well the pigment is preserved deshpande et al 2014 tse et al 2015 highly labile pigments such as the ubiquitous chl a and fuco diatoms were detected well above limited concentrations fig 2 indicating weak diagenetic processes occurring within the collected cores in addition pheide a and phe a the dominant and most stable chl a degradations can provide insight regarding syn depositional and post depositional environment conditions of sedimentary pigments szymczak żyła et al 2016 the significant correlation between chl a and phe a in the changtan reservoir r 0 844 n 62 p 0 01 table 1 shows that the effect of diagenetic processes on chl a should be weak as a small fraction of chl a degraded to phe a in anoxic hypoxic environment in addition good pigment preservation was indicated by a low ratio of pheopigment a the sum of pheide a and phe a to chl a pheo a chl a this ranged from 1 14 7 60 in ct 0 and 0 84 4 56 at ct 8 sites fig 3 the average pheo a chl a ratios at ct 0 and ct 8 were 4 09 and 2 79 respectively suggesting that preservation conditions were better at ct 8 than ct 0 the ratio of total carotenoid to total identified pigments tcar tpigments was used as an indicator of pigment degradation in sediment reuss et al 2005 this ranged from 0 32 0 50 at ct 0 and 0 33 0 42 at ct 8 fig 3 there was no significant trend in this ratio throughout the core indicating that all sediments underwent the same degradation conditions szymczak żyła et al 2016 overall the sedimentary pigments were preserved adequately enough for us to track the past primary productivity and phytoplankton succession as interpreted from reliable pigment trends all 18 photosynthetic pigment concentrations in sediment cores varied little before the mid 2000s but increased substantially afterward fig 2 which can be attributed to changes in trophic state and primary productivity romero viana et al 2010 the coniss results showed that the greatest difference was observed in core levels before and after the mid 2000s at both sites fig 2 the chl a concentration increased from 0 39 0 15 mean standard deviation and 0 31 0 12 μg pigment g 1 sediment in the first stage to 7 96 1 85 and 3 58 1 59 μg pigment g 1 sediment in the second stage at ct 0 and ct 8 respectively ββ car a better proxy for total algae biomass szymczak żyła et al 2016 increased from 0 16 0 05 and 0 07 0 01 μg pigment g 1 sediment in the first stage to 0 86 0 14 and 0 19 0 06 μg pigment g 1 sediment in the second stage at ct 0 and ct 8 respectively the chl a and ββ car stratigraphy in the sediment cores demonstrated an overall increase in phytoplankton biomass in the past 30 years within two distinct periods 3 2 influence of anthropogenic activities on the phytoplankton community the specific pigment content of the two sediment cores consistently represented the dominant algae community in the changtan reservoir fig 2 the most abundant specific pigments were cantha and zea from cyanobacteria chl b and lutein from green algae diadino diato and fuco mainly from diatoms peri and hex fuco from dinoflagellates and allo from cryptophytes jiménez et al 2015 less abundant pigments included chl c2 minor pigment in red algae mgdvp from prasinoxanthin containing algae neo from mesostigmatophytes and viola from chrysophytes and mesostigmatophytes roy et al 2011 there were significant correlations between many of the pigments including between cantha and zea r 0 934 n 62 p 0 01 table 1 chl b and lutein r 0 918 n 62 p 0 01 and peri and hex fuco r 0 894 n 62 p 0 01 consistent with their known co occurrence in specific algae groups jiménez et al 2015 romero viana et al 2010 the presence of specific phytoplankton pigments throughout the stratigraphic profile indicated that cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and cryptophytes were the dominating algae groups in the changtan reservoir over the past 30 years plankton sampling in 2016 and 2017 from our current work showed that the proportion of cyanobacteria was the largest 33 72 82 47 based on the percentage of phytoplankton abundance in each season the percentages of green algae diatoms and cryptophytes were 8 42 19 23 7 57 39 31 and 0 60 15 09 respectively thus the dominant algae community inferred from sedimentary pigments was consistent with the current algae monitoring data moreover the 2016 and 2017 monitoring data showed that cyanobacteria were the dominant group in summer and autumn 82 47 and 74 89 respectively providing the potential source for algae blooms nitrogen n p and n p ratios in the waterbody are vital elements limiting phytoplankton growth and the principal force driving algae bloom formation szymczak żyła et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 from 1985 to 2015 the sedimentary tn tp and n p ratios increased markedly in the changtan reservoir previous studies have shown that increased n p ratios created p limiting conditions for phytoplankton and favored non n2 fixing cyanobacterium posch et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 spearman correlation analysis of our results indicated that sedimentary nutrient content tn and tp had a statistically strong influence on all pigment concentrations p 0 01 table 1 nonpoint source pollution was the main source of n and p input into the changtan reservoir including surface runoff and discharge from crop and livestock production the total tn emission from point source and non point source is 41 34 t a and 524 31 t a respectively the total tp emission from point source and non point source is 8 89 t a and 90 80 t a respectively among the non point source tn emissions the loss of tn from urban surface runoff was 98 76 t that from farmland runoff was 127 42 t a and that from livestock and poultry was 176 90 t a among the tp emissions the loss of tp from urban surface runoff was 4 48 t that from farmland runoff was 2 81 t a and that from livestock and poultry was 64 13 t a the significant upsurge in algae biomass in the reservoir since the mid 2000s was associated with anthropogenic activities such as increasing agriculture and industrialization as well as urbanization in taizhou city concurrently a serious cyanobacterial bloom occurred over hundreds of square kilometers in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin in may 2007 yang et al 2016 it is noteworthy that nutrients play an important role in phytoplankton biomass increases and algae bloom formation jiménez et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 while climate change e g warming favors the expansion of algae blooms directly or indirectly capo et al 2017 yang et al 2016 3 3 impacts of meteorological factors on the phytoplankton community significant variations in temperature and annual maximum air temperature tmax were observed during the past 30 years at the changtan reservoir p 0 05 temperature tmax and precipitation increased by 1 31 c 2 35 c and 8 36 mm respectively from 1985 to 2016 fig 4 a c the m k test results showed that the progressive rank series of temperature and tmax increased and surpassed the 0 05 confidence level indicating that the temperature and tmax had a statistically significant upward trend from 1985 to 2016 fig 4d e however the progressive and retrograde rank series of precipitation exhibited no significant trend over the past 30 years fig 4f potential trend turning points were estimated when the progressive and retrograde rank series intersected in the confidence interval toride et al 2018 suggesting that the increasing trend of temperature and tmax transited to a stable condition around 1997 and 2003 respectively significantly positive correlations were found between sedimentary pigments and both temperature and tmax at the changtan reservoir n 62 p 0 01 table 1 warming air temperature can heat the epilimnion leading to stronger thermal stratification within lakes kraemer et al 2015 posch et al 2012 which may impede water turnover and affect the compensation of hypolimnetic o2 deficits yang et al 2016 this can directly impact phytoplankton physiology posch et al 2012 potentially leading to taxonomic shifts and biodiversity loss o beirne et al 2017 furthermore the changtan reservoir located in a subtropical lowland region is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events particularly extreme high temperature havens et al 2016 the phytoplankton biomass in the changtan reservoir experienced an unprecedented upsurge in 2007 fig 2 this could be attributed to the extreme high temperature that triggered the multiplication of algae organisms due to sufficient nutrient levels havens et al 2016 posch et al 2012 precipitation influences phytoplankton biomass dynamics due to greater runoff into water bodies toride et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 although no significant correlations were found between sedimentary pigments and precipitation table 1 indirect impacts of rainfall on phytoplankton biomass may have been neglected havens et al 2016 precipitation is plentiful in the study area heavy rainfall may promote the formation of harmful algae blooms due to the re suspension of benthic algae organisms and or increases in primary productivity o beirne et al 2017 yang et al 2016 low wind speed can also be a precondition for harmful algae bloom occurrence by affecting the synthesis of gas vesicles and distribution of algae cells helbling et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the changtan reservoir is strongly influenced by a warm moist air mass and typhoons in july august and september which results in enhancing vertical mixing have a negative influence on algae bloom formation kraemer et al 2015 overall the impact mechanisms of meteorological factors on the phytoplankton community including air temperature precipitation and wind speed are complex interrelated and difficult to separate and quantify mwangi et al 2016 3 4 relative contribution of predictors to the phytoplankton community gam analysis was applied to estimate how and when climate change and anthropogenic activities contributed to variations in phytoplankton biomass capo et al 2017 the contribution of the two predictors sed tp and temperature to the variation of total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass are shown in fig 5 significant correlations p 0 05 were found between the response variables and explanatory variables in all models the adjusted coefficients of determination r2 for the gams were all greater than 0 895 indicating good relationships between the explanatory variables and response variables for all five models the contribution of sed tp increased sharply and was much larger than that of temperature after around 2007 the negative effect of sed tp p 0 001 on response variables changed to a positive effect after 2007 fig 5 these changes were concurrent with a significant increase in algae biomass the changtan reservoir experienced increasing inputs of n p and n p ratio and developed p limiting conditions for phytoplankton accelerating algae growth and promoting primary productivity in the reservoir which was similar with the literatures posch et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 the responses of total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass to temperature p 0 05 were positive since the late 1990s fig 5 the increasing trend s turning point for temperature occurred in 1997 according to the m k test fig 4 consistent with the results above gam simulations indicated that a temperature upsurge would affect algae population dynamics positively due to the enhanced growth rate increased water column stability and extended growing season visser et al 2016 the relative contribution of sed tp to variations in total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass table 2 suggested that tp was a good predictor of phytoplankton biomass the relative contribution of temperature to variations in total algae cyanobacteria green algae diatom and cryptophyte biomass table 2 suggested that the response of phytoplankton biomass to temperature depends strongly on nutrient load which was consistent with previous study visser et al 2016 a previous study found that cyanobacteria biomass was influenced by nutrients and temperature the nutrients explained a larger proportion of the variation according to data from more than 1000 lakes in the united states marieke et al 2013 research using data from 143 lakes along a latitudinal gradient from europe to south america indicated that at lower nutrient levels the frequency of cyanobacterial occurrence was below 30 over a wide range of water temperatures rising very slowly in contrast at higher nutrient concentrations there was a rapid and nonlinear increase in cyanobacterial biovolume with temperature havens and paerl 2015 paerl and otten 2013 these results showed that the impact of temperature on phytoplankton biomass was slight at low nutrient levels consistent with the current study moreover the influence of nutrients and temperature varied among algae taxa rigosi et al 2014 for instance some taxa such as anabaena responded more strongly to increasing nutrients than rising temperature whereas other taxa such as microcystis were more sensitive to rising temperature rigosi et al 2014 visser et al 2016 the gams explained the variance of diatoms best with sed tp f 212 65 p 0 001 accounting for 97 36 and temperature f 9 12 p 0 01 accounting for 24 64 table 2 diatoms have relatively high growth rates and are generally adapted to low light levels in high nutrient containing water compared with other algae taxa reynolds 2006 winder et al 2009 found that smaller planktonic diatom species are suitable for living in increased nutrients and stratification conditions in lake tahoe california for past decades moreover the diatom assemblage structure can be influenced by confounding factors such as fluctuations in temperature light intensity discharge and grazing pressure lavoie et al 2014 diatoms are sensitive to temperature so lower temperatures can promote diatom growth because their optimal temperature for growth and photosynthesis is around 15 c paerl and otten 2013 considering the broad heterogeneity of morphological and eco physiological traits among diatom species reynolds 2006 the best adaption for diatoms to increasing nutrients and climate warming induced mixing alterations may be species selection winder et al 2009 increases in sediment tp concentration since 2007 have significantly raised the contribution of tp to algae biomass seriously threatening the water quality of the changtan reservoir fig 6 on the other hand as climate change persists the reservoir is likely to become dominated by cyanobacteria and experience algae blooms even without a further rise in nutrient inputs our results imply that a climate driven change in water temperature would modify the phytoplankton community toward those species favoring increased nutrients and higher water temperatures the longer action to control eutrophication is delayed and the more time that climate change is given to develop synergistic effects on nutrients the less likely it becomes that eutrophication control will be achieved havens and paerl 2015 hence climate change should be considered within the context of evolving nutrient mitigation strategies for eutrophication control to maintain the water quality in watersheds such as the changtan reservoir with increasing urbanization many climate change adaptation policies should be explored to mitigate nutrient loading into aquatic environments for example protection and restoration of buffer strips in stream systems provide an effective strategy to moderate temperature regimes and offset warming and protect water quality for downstream ecosystems and water supply areas davies 2010 capon et al 2013 long term management strategies must recognize and account for the fact that meteorological conditions are evolving as climate changes impacting the path of nutrient inputs through watersheds and affecting nutrient loading in water bodies climate induced impacts to hydrological and thermal regimes enhancing algal growth in reservoir systems can be offset through improved management of environmental flow releases from reservoirs arthington et al 2010 poff et al 2010 4 conclusions well preserved sedimentary pigments preserve evidence for changes in primary production over the past thirty years in the changtan reservoir china the dominant phytoplankton groups determined by pigment analysis were cyanobacteria green algae diatoms and cryptophytes consistent with recent observational results for plankton sedimentary pigments recorded a significant upsurge in phytoplankton biomass in the changtan reservoir after 2007 m k statistical tests showed that this was linked to a significant increase in air temperature over the catchment and a disastrous cyanobacterial bloom that occurred in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin in may 2007 increases in anthropogenic nutrients and changes in climate affected phytoplankton dynamics and algae biomass in the reservoir gam analysis demonstrated that nutrient loading explained a larger proportion of algae biomass variation than temperature in addition a significant increase in sed tp had a positive effect on algae biomass from 2007 onward of the species considered variations in diatoms were best explained by gam analysis indicating that diatoms may be the best adapted of the phytoplankton taxonomic groups to warming temperatures and increasing nutrients conflict of interest the authors

6651,agricultural nonpoint source anps pollution has become a major reason for eutrophication in many regions of the world however it is still difficult to identify the relative contributions of different anpss to the nutrient export flux at the watershed outlet due to a lack of effective methods the export coefficient approach eca and the soil and water assessment tool swat which is a process based watershed simulation model with aquatic nutrient retention simulation modules were implemented to identify the anps and its associated quantitative contributions in the three gorges reservoir region china by using the swat eca framework nutrient loadings to the river reaches in the subbasin and the export flux at the outlet of the watershed which were derived from individual agricultural sources in each subbasin were quantified accordingly the primary goal of this study is to quantify the pollutant loads from different agricultural sources by using swat eca the proposed work was conducted in the xiangxi river watershed of the three gorges reservoir region hubei province china the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loads that were generated from the agricultural sources were 1299 1 t a 1 and 97 4 t a 1 respectively livestock production was the main source of the tn load accounting for 82 of agricultural tn load livestock production and crop cultivation were the main sources of the tp load accounting for 52 and 42 respectively the delivery ratios of n and p from the source areas to the watershed outlet were relatively high in the study watershed tn 1234 t a 1 and tp 87 1 t a 1 from agricultural sources were ultimately released to the reservoir area which accounted for 40 2 and 37 6 respectively of the total fluxes from the whole watershed the comprehensive approach that is proposed in this study can be useful for identifying the contributions of individual agricultural sources to the nutrient export flux at the watershed outlet keywords nonpoint source pollution agricultural sources swat export coefficient swat eca three gorges reservoir region 1 introduction it has been shown that nonpoint source nps pollution is usually transported from diffuse sources in comparison with the point source ps cai et al 2018 fan et al 2008 in recent years nps pollution is one of the rising issues that may have direct and indirect negative impacts on public health and the natural environment chen et al 2016 duncan 2014 li et al 2011 in the united states nps pollution contributes to nearly 60 of the impairments of the water body u s environmental protection agency 2013 in the great lakes region a number of large scale watershed management programs have been conducted to alleviate the current stage of the water quality crisis keitzer et al 2016 yen et al 2016 scavia et al 2017 meanwhile potential threats caused by nps pollution also occurred in china with great challenges shen et al 2012 fast growing industrial agricultural and domestic activities have triggered numerous public issues in varying aspects for example in the three gorges reservoir region estimated population of 30 million residents nps was responsible for 82 of the total pollution loads wang 2012 the nps commonly includes an urban nonpoint source unps and an agricultural nonpoint source anps such as applications of fertilizers and animal production which are difficult to quantify ouyang et al 2018 ongley et al 2010 previous studies have found that anps pollution has become one of the main sources of water quality degradation around the world rong et al 2017 volk et al 2016 duncan 2014 likely due to the excessive nutrient inputs specifically applications of fertilizers li et al 2019 li et al 2018a b swaney et al 2012 agriculture activities have contributed to approximately 48 and 55 of the total nps flux of surface waters in germany and in the entire european union respectively volk et al 2009 also a main source of pollution in china anps pollution has been the primary cause for accelerated eutrophication in many highlighted river basins and water bodies ouyang et al 2017 approximately 92 of the tn flux from the yangtze river came from anps mao et al 2013 it was reported that tn and tp contributions in the agriculture sector were approximately 56 5 and 14 3 respectively in taihu lake in china zhu 1998 nps pollutants from livestock husbandry and other associated agricultural activities had greater environmental impacts than other pollution sources such as industrial waste and raw sewage zhang et al 2011 to conduct nps pollution control with limited resources identification of anps and the corresponding quantitative contributions to nps pollution have been a crucial step in initiating the following management plans with limited financial resources fenech et al 2012 niraula et al 2013 the dispersion of anps leads to difficulties in identifying the corresponding boundaries and critical source area panagopoulosa et al 2011 several approaches have been used to identify the contributions of different sources such as index models wang et al 2015 the isotope labeling method jin et al 2015 li et al 2014 process based watershed models li et al 2017 li et al 2018a shen et al 2012 and the export coefficient approach eca white et al 2015 the index models have a comprehensive consideration for the factors that may have a potential influence on pollutant loss however these approaches predominantly target on phosphorus applications which could be less effective in evaluating other nutrient sources ouyang and wang 2008 process based watershed models apply continuous simulations of hydrologic and nutrient processes the transportation and transformation of pollutants within watersheds can be assessed by examining the modeling outputs on the other hand process based models are generally considering the pollutant migration processes but do not distinguish between different sources since some observation data can be difficult to collect kim et al 2017 shang et al 2012 many sophisticated models have been successfully developed to simulate the distribution and transportation of nutrients including the agricultural non point source pollution agnps young et al 1989 and annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps models bingner et al 2015 as well as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1993 among these mechanistic models swat has been widely used worldwide including studies in europe ricci et al 2018 asia talebizadeh et al 2010 africa setegn et al 2010 and north america yen et al 2015 for different purposes different methods are often coupled jointly for example p export coefficients and load reductions were investigated at different spatial scales with scenarios of management practices by swat james and jason 2017 however few studies were found to have a focus on different sources of identification through the combination of two different methods at the watershed outlet to solve this issue the eca was developed to examine pollution sources especially for large scale regions the eca was applied to use the rate that nutrients are lost from identifiable sources to calculate the nutrient flux of the drainage network surface only the rate is generally derived from studies and field experiments ma et al 2011 ding et al 2010 the eca has been adopted as part of the nationwide environmental assessment approach such as the conservation effects assessment project ceap in the united states white et al 2015 specifically the eca has been implemented in the contiguous united states for a nationwide evaluation of sediment and nutrient loads white et al 2015 however this method neglects the transformation of pollutants while they are transported from the sources starting point to the receiving water bodies ending point yang et al 2016 in this study the swat and the eca were incorporated swat eca to identify the loads and the contributions of different agricultural sources at the watershed outlet while considering the migration processes of various sources of pollutants anpss were separated from other sources in terms of the nutrient export at the watershed outlet which was quantified by using the framework of swat eca the primary goal of this study is to develop a novel approach swat eca and to identify the contributions of different anpss for nonpoint source pollution and its corresponding distribution in the given watershed specifically three objectives are defined i to calculate the amount of pollutant discharge from different agricultural sources using the pollutant discharge coefficient method ii to quantify the n and p delivery ratios of different subbasins in the whole watershed and iii to identify the contribution of different anpss from nonpoint source pollution and its corresponding distribution in the whole xiangxi river watershed china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiangxi river watershed is located between 110 47 and 111 13 east 30 96 and 31 67 north which is in the three gorges reservoir region fig 1 a with an area of 3150 km2 the xiangxi river originates from shennongjia national forest park in northwestern hubei province the total length of the xiangxi river is 95 km and it flows through xingshan county approximately 78 km to zigui county and finally into the three gorges dam fig 1b this river includes three major tributaries i e nanyang river gufu river and gaolan river fig 1c the study area has a relatively humid subtropical climate that is characterized by a hot humid summer and a cold dry winter the average annual precipitation is 1015 mm and the mean annual temperature is 16 6 c the watershed is characterized by a typical mountainous landscape and is covered by 88 1 forests 5 55 farmland 5 21 grassland and 1 14 other landscape types fig 2 the problem of algal bloom has been threatening the xiangxi river every spring since 2003 2 2 computational framework the schematic structure of the proposed computational framework is shown in fig 3 the first step is to calculate the pollutant discharge from individual agricultural sources by using agricultural statistical data and the pollutant export coefficient the loads of tn or tp that were exported from each source per unit time per unit area in the watershed the second step is to obtain the pollutant transport efficiency in river reach by performing swat simulations the pollutant transport efficiency is calculated according to the reach input rich in and output rich out modules in the output file of swat eq 1 which was named the reach transport coefficient indicating the increased or decreased of nutrient flux after transporting through river reach in an individual subbasin 1 reach transport coefficient r i c h o u t r i c h i n the pollutant load at the outlet of each subbasin is the amount that pollutant released to river reach in an individual subbasin before flowing to the reservoir the receiving water body in other words pollutants that were generated from the upstream subbasin will flow through downstream subbasins and finally enter the reservoir the value that decided the final pollutant load released into the reservoir was defined as the pollutant delivery ratio the pollutant delivery ratio of each subbasin was the product of multiple channel migration coefficients all subbasins were passed along to outlet of the watershed li et al 2018a furthermore the pollutant delivery ratios were multiplied by different anps pollution productions to achieve the agricultural pollution intensity for each subbasin 2 3 quantification of pollution released from different agricultural sources the export coefficient approach is used to estimate the accurate pollutant discharge amounts from different agricultural sources including crop cultivation livestock production and rural activities the basic data required are population areas of different crops cultivation and farming activities table s2 the livestock production status such as the kinds amounts and treatment pattern of animal manure table s1 and the pollutant export coefficients of different agricultural sources the data was obtained from the rural survey during july 1st to august 15th in 2014 and the agricultural economic statistics yearbook of each town in 2013 the pollutant export coefficients were based on the first pollution source census table 1 ren et al 2015 dong et al 2011 the equation for the export coefficient is shown as follows 2 k c con c k f 100 where kc is the export coefficient in a certain field con is the pollutant emissions from the conventional treatment kg km 2 ck is the amount of pollutant emissions from the control treatment kg km 2 and f is the application rate of fertilizer kg km 2 livestock and human discharge were determined using the unit load method the export coefficients take sewage and solid waste into account the equation for the export coefficient is shown as follows 3 k p s w 1 η s r u 1 η r where kp is the export coefficient per head kg head 1 feather 1 yr 1 or per person g people 1 d 1 sw is the amount of pollutants produced in waste water kg head 1 feather 1 yr 1 or g people 1 d 1 ηs is the availability ratio of the wastewater ru is the amount of solid waste produced kg head 1 feather 1 yr 1 or g people 1 d 1 and ηr is the availability ratio of solid waste the scope of the rural survey included 11 towns 27 administrative villages and more than 500 households fig s1 the pollutant discharge loads in each subbasin were calculated by using the agricultural production statistical data and the pollutant export coefficients 2 4 model settings since the early 1990s the swat model was developed to perform environmental assessments and the associated impacts on the natural environment that were caused by numerous sources of pollutants specifically nps arnold et al 1993 the swat is a continuous time spatially distributed semiphysically based model that has been widely used to conduct watershed modeling on flow and nutrient processes wang et al 2016 feng et al 2017 guo et al 2018 in the past two decades more than 3000 peer reviewed articles have been published which can be assessed online swat database the swat

85 respectively fig s2 it was indicated that the swat model is capable in terms of statistical performance of performing tn and tp predictions in the xiangxi river watershed 2 6 calculation of the pollutant delivery ratio the discharge amount of pollutant from the subbasins does not represent the amount that reaching reservoirs or lakes the process of transport posed substantial influence on the pollutant loads that were exported into the lakes in this study the swat model was used to demonstrate detailed watershed processes such as pollutant transport and attenuation in addition the results of the swat are used to calculate the river channel migration coefficients in each subbasin pollutants that were generated from the upstream subbasins flowed directly to the connected downstream subbasins and finally reached the watershed outlet after a finite number of transitions fig 4 this hydrologic process most nutrient transport is also included could be explained by the accumulative effect of the river network shang et al 2012 which indicates that pollutants of all upstream watersheds will be accumulated at the most downstream outlet for example if the pollutants that were exported from subbasin 1 flowed through n subbasins into the watershed outlet the pollution delivery coefficient of subbasin 1 is the product of river migration coefficients of each subbasin flowing through 3 results 3 1 tn and tp loads from agricultural sources in this study anps was divided into sources of livestock production crop cultivation and rural activities different anps pollution loads were calculated by the pollutant export coefficients in this study the potential tn and tp loads from crop cultivation livestock production and rural activities were 205 3 1061 32 8 t yr 1 and 40 6 51 5 83 t yr 1 respectively livestock production contributed to the highest rate 82 of anps tn pollution load followed by crop cultivation 16 fig 5 a whereas the primary source of tp was livestock production 52 while crop cultivation was also an important part 42 fig 5b the contribution of rural activities was small under 10 in both tn and tp loads the tn discharge load had the same distribution as tp in the whole watershed fig 6 the subbasins with considerable great amount of pollutant loads were mostly distributed in the downstream of the three main tributaries of xiangxi river the tn and tp discharge intensity reached 10 3 17 2 kg ha 1 and 0 79 1 39 kg ha 1 respectively few tn and tp loads were discharged in the upstream of the whole watershed the tn discharge intensity was less than 0 61 kg ha 1 in the upstream subbasins 1 4 and 9 the tp discharge intensity was less than 0 09 kg ha 1 in subbasins 1 2 4 7 8 9 and 11 3 2 delivery ratios from source areas to the watershed outlet tn and tp delivery ratios were both relatively high over 0 50 in the whole basin especially in the downstream of rivers fig 7 compared with tn the tp delivery ratios were positively related with the distance from the outlet of watershed the flux of tn exported to the outlet of the watershed increased rather than decreased in the subbasins near the watershed outlet especially for tn the amount of tp loads in subbasins 25 27 and 29 were also directly exported to the river without any retention only 5 of tn and 10 7 of tp loads that were generated from the sources were retained by the river networks when they transported from source area to the watershed outlet fig 8 3 3 agricultural pollutants exported at the outlet of watershed agricultural nonpoint sources were identified from other sources in addition exported loads of pollutants from different anpss were quantified at the watershed outlet the tn and tp exported loads from crop cultivation livestock production and rural activities were 195 2 1007 9 30 9 t yr 1 and 36 2 45 7 5 2 t yr 1 respectively only small reduction rates can be found by comparing tn and tp generated loads the export intensities of agricultural pollutants have the same distribution with the discharge intensities areas with high export intensities of nutrients were concentrated in subbasins 12 16 17 and 25 in the confluence of gufu river and nanyang river fig 9 the export intensities of tn and tp reached 10 2 11 7 kg ha 1 and 0 79 1 26 kg ha 1 respectively the nps loads of tn and tp were primarily distributed in the downstream of the whole watershed especially in subbasins 16 17 and 25 contribution rates from the anps of tn and tp to nps were relatively small in the upstream of the watershed the values of tn and tp were only 0 10 and 0 9 27 respectively in the middle and downstream of the whole watershed the anps contribution to nps significantly increased contribution rates of tn and tp reached 55 4 97 4 and 56 3 86 1 respectively fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 distribution of agricultural nonpoint sources in the watershed the xiangxi river watershed is a typical mountainous watershed forest was the main land use type which accounted for over 80 of the whole watershed area fig 3 with fewer population and agricultural crops agricultural nonpoint sources in this study were mainly distributed in the confluence of rivers and downstream livestock production population and crop cultivation accounted for 63 5 59 1 and 59 0 respectively of the whole watershed in these areas wu et al 2016 therefore these operations should be managed as a part of anps yuan et al 2011 however the corresponding management practices could be different than ordinary approaches e g a reduction of fertilizer applications or construction of conservation facilities instead decision makers may take advantage of the additional guidelines for regulating these sources in the upstream of the watershed tn and tp pollution export were relatively small because forest is the dominant land use less population farmland and livestock were distributed in the forest simulation results of different scenarios indicated that any additional increase in the forest area might further reduce the surface runoff rate and sediment yields jim and yang 2006 in contrast tn and tp pollution exported from agricultural nonpoint sources were mainly concentrated along the two sides of the gufu river the nanyang river and the gaolan river along two sides of the three tributaries especially at the confluence of the two rivers the agricultural area is larger than that of the upstream area in each tributary the primary reason is that the soils on the steep slopes are much less productive than those in the river valleys because of the contained low organic matter content and poor structure shi et al 2004 livestock production was the main source of the tn load accounting for 81 7 of the agricultural tn load in the study area fig 5a livestock production and crop cultivation were both the main sources of the tp load accounting for 52 3 and 41 5 respectively fig 5b according to the rural investigation livestock production was decentralized on a small scale ren et al 2015 animal manure usually piled up temporarily without any treatment facilities the pollutants of tn and tp were directly washed into the surrounding water when a heavy rain is encountered cropland and orange orchards accounted for most crop farming areas along the two sides of the rives anps pollutants were easily lost by the great soil erosion because of the sloped cultivation zhang et al 2014 agricultural activities in such mountainous and hilly regions played an important role in affecting the adjacent aquatic systems somura et al 2012 valentina and mike 2015 4 2 migration of agricultural nonpoint pollutants in the watershed in this study typical topographic and climatic conditions cause a high migration speed and low retention ratios of different agricultural nonpoint pollutants over 50 of the area had a slope that ranged from 7 to 25 whereas 37 5 of the area had a slope greater than 25 ding et al 2010 the subtropical monsoon humid climate comes with an average annual precipitation of 1015 mm however precipitation is unevenly distributed through the seasons large amounts of n and p will be washed away by the surface runoff and soil erosion in response to a torrential rainfall event this migration process is evidently different than that of the plateau lake area specifically considerable differences can be found among pollutants that are generated and exported in the system li et al 2018b in the present study small differences were found between pollutants that were generated from the source area and exported at the watershed outlet which were likely due to the small amount of aquatic nutrient retention that occurred during transport fig 8 consequently the distributions of anps pollutant export intensities were the same as the generation intensities figs 6 and 9 high export intensities of tn and tp can be found in the three main tributaries fig 9 a shorter distance between the pollutant sources and water body may enhance or positively relate to the pollutant delivery ratios jim and yang 2006 in addition three main tributaries that contribute a heavy water volume to the reservoir run through these subbasins the developed river network increased the tn and tp loads into the reservoir in contrast the tn and tp delivery ratios of the upstream subbasins are relatively small the reason may be that reaches in the northern region are mostly longer in length therefore pollutant fluxes may gradually decrease from the upper reaches arheimer and brandt 2000 in terms of the nutrient loading that was generated from the sources livestock production was the biggest source for tn while livestock production and crop cultivation dominated the tp loading fig 8 the livestock production source was still the largest contributor of the n pollutant in terms of the export flux at the watershed outlet whereas livestock production and crop cultivation contributed the most p export flux fig 8 5 conclusion identification of the links between individual agricultural sources and water pollution is essential for nps pollution control however the relative contributions of agricultural sources to the nutrient export fluxes at the watershed scale are poorly understood due to the difficulties in quantifying the nutrient flux at the outlet of the watershed that was derived from an individual source by the incorporation of eca and swat livestock production was identified as the dominant anps of tn while the majority of the tp export flux was from livestock production and crop cultivation agricultural pollutants that were retained in hilly and mountainous regions were relatively low as a result the anps pollutant generation and export were all concentrated in the downstream of the three main tributaries thus the primary task for water quality improvement is to strengthen the agricultural source control enforcement of regulations or laws of nps pollution in the middle and the downstream of the xiangxi river watershed the results of the contribution of anps pollution to the watershed can support identification of the critical agricultural source and the associated management practices in this study three gorges reservoir region it was suggested to develop programs for household septic tanks to collect livestock production and rural sewage in rural areas and in small towns along two sides of the three tributaries more hedgerows or buffer belts need to be built to prevent nonpoint pollutants from entering the rivers in addition the proposed framework swat eca can be further implemented in other parts of the world for an environmental assessment the proposed work will alleviate the exposure of livestock excrement to the air whereas it will directly release polluting gases into the air or be washed away by the rain declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

6651,agricultural nonpoint source anps pollution has become a major reason for eutrophication in many regions of the world however it is still difficult to identify the relative contributions of different anpss to the nutrient export flux at the watershed outlet due to a lack of effective methods the export coefficient approach eca and the soil and water assessment tool swat which is a process based watershed simulation model with aquatic nutrient retention simulation modules were implemented to identify the anps and its associated quantitative contributions in the three gorges reservoir region china by using the swat eca framework nutrient loadings to the river reaches in the subbasin and the export flux at the outlet of the watershed which were derived from individual agricultural sources in each subbasin were quantified accordingly the primary goal of this study is to quantify the pollutant loads from different agricultural sources by using swat eca the proposed work was conducted in the xiangxi river watershed of the three gorges reservoir region hubei province china the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loads that were generated from the agricultural sources were 1299 1 t a 1 and 97 4 t a 1 respectively livestock production was the main source of the tn load accounting for 82 of agricultural tn load livestock production and crop cultivation were the main sources of the tp load accounting for 52 and 42 respectively the delivery ratios of n and p from the source areas to the watershed outlet were relatively high in the study watershed tn 1234 t a 1 and tp 87 1 t a 1 from agricultural sources were ultimately released to the reservoir area which accounted for 40 2 and 37 6 respectively of the total fluxes from the whole watershed the comprehensive approach that is proposed in this study can be useful for identifying the contributions of individual agricultural sources to the nutrient export flux at the watershed outlet keywords nonpoint source pollution agricultural sources swat export coefficient swat eca three gorges reservoir region 1 introduction it has been shown that nonpoint source nps pollution is usually transported from diffuse sources in comparison with the point source ps cai et al 2018 fan et al 2008 in recent years nps pollution is one of the rising issues that may have direct and indirect negative impacts on public health and the natural environment chen et al 2016 duncan 2014 li et al 2011 in the united states nps pollution contributes to nearly 60 of the impairments of the water body u s environmental protection agency 2013 in the great lakes region a number of large scale watershed management programs have been conducted to alleviate the current stage of the water quality crisis keitzer et al 2016 yen et al 2016 scavia et al 2017 meanwhile potential threats caused by nps pollution also occurred in china with great challenges shen et al 2012 fast growing industrial agricultural and domestic activities have triggered numerous public issues in varying aspects for example in the three gorges reservoir region estimated population of 30 million residents nps was responsible for 82 of the total pollution loads wang 2012 the nps commonly includes an urban nonpoint source unps and an agricultural nonpoint source anps such as applications of fertilizers and animal production which are difficult to quantify ouyang et al 2018 ongley et al 2010 previous studies have found that anps pollution has become one of the main sources of water quality degradation around the world rong et al 2017 volk et al 2016 duncan 2014 likely due to the excessive nutrient inputs specifically applications of fertilizers li et al 2019 li et al 2018a b swaney et al 2012 agriculture activities have contributed to approximately 48 and 55 of the total nps flux of surface waters in germany and in the entire european union respectively volk et al 2009 also a main source of pollution in china anps pollution has been the primary cause for accelerated eutrophication in many highlighted river basins and water bodies ouyang et al 2017 approximately 92 of the tn flux from the yangtze river came from anps mao et al 2013 it was reported that tn and tp contributions in the agriculture sector were approximately 56 5 and 14 3 respectively in taihu lake in china zhu 1998 nps pollutants from livestock husbandry and other associated agricultural activities had greater environmental impacts than other pollution sources such as industrial waste and raw sewage zhang et al 2011 to conduct nps pollution control with limited resources identification of anps and the corresponding quantitative contributions to nps pollution have been a crucial step in initiating the following management plans with limited financial resources fenech et al 2012 niraula et al 2013 the dispersion of anps leads to difficulties in identifying the corresponding boundaries and critical source area panagopoulosa et al 2011 several approaches have been used to identify the contributions of different sources such as index models wang et al 2015 the isotope labeling method jin et al 2015 li et al 2014 process based watershed models li et al 2017 li et al 2018a shen et al 2012 and the export coefficient approach eca white et al 2015 the index models have a comprehensive consideration for the factors that may have a potential influence on pollutant loss however these approaches predominantly target on phosphorus applications which could be less effective in evaluating other nutrient sources ouyang and wang 2008 process based watershed models apply continuous simulations of hydrologic and nutrient processes the transportation and transformation of pollutants within watersheds can be assessed by examining the modeling outputs on the other hand process based models are generally considering the pollutant migration processes but do not distinguish between different sources since some observation data can be difficult to collect kim et al 2017 shang et al 2012 many sophisticated models have been successfully developed to simulate the distribution and transportation of nutrients including the agricultural non point source pollution agnps young et al 1989 and annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps models bingner et al 2015 as well as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1993 among these mechanistic models swat has been widely used worldwide including studies in europe ricci et al 2018 asia talebizadeh et al 2010 africa setegn et al 2010 and north america yen et al 2015 for different purposes different methods are often coupled jointly for example p export coefficients and load reductions were investigated at different spatial scales with scenarios of management practices by swat james and jason 2017 however few studies were found to have a focus on different sources of identification through the combination of two different methods at the watershed outlet to solve this issue the eca was developed to examine pollution sources especially for large scale regions the eca was applied to use the rate that nutrients are lost from identifiable sources to calculate the nutrient flux of the drainage network surface only the rate is generally derived from studies and field experiments ma et al 2011 ding et al 2010 the eca has been adopted as part of the nationwide environmental assessment approach such as the conservation effects assessment project ceap in the united states white et al 2015 specifically the eca has been implemented in the contiguous united states for a nationwide evaluation of sediment and nutrient loads white et al 2015 however this method neglects the transformation of pollutants while they are transported from the sources starting point to the receiving water bodies ending point yang et al 2016 in this study the swat and the eca were incorporated swat eca to identify the loads and the contributions of different agricultural sources at the watershed outlet while considering the migration processes of various sources of pollutants anpss were separated from other sources in terms of the nutrient export at the watershed outlet which was quantified by using the framework of swat eca the primary goal of this study is to develop a novel approach swat eca and to identify the contributions of different anpss for nonpoint source pollution and its corresponding distribution in the given watershed specifically three objectives are defined i to calculate the amount of pollutant discharge from different agricultural sources using the pollutant discharge coefficient method ii to quantify the n and p delivery ratios of different subbasins in the whole watershed and iii to identify the contribution of different anpss from nonpoint source pollution and its corresponding distribution in the whole xiangxi river watershed china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiangxi river watershed is located between 110 47 and 111 13 east 30 96 and 31 67 north which is in the three gorges reservoir region fig 1 a with an area of 3150 km2 the xiangxi river originates from shennongjia national forest park in northwestern hubei province the total length of the xiangxi river is 95 km and it flows through xingshan county approximately 78 km to zigui county and finally into the three gorges dam fig 1b this river includes three major tributaries i e nanyang river gufu river and gaolan river fig 1c the study area has a relatively humid subtropical climate that is characterized by a hot humid summer and a cold dry winter the average annual precipitation is 1015 mm and the mean annual temperature is 16 6 c the watershed is characterized by a typical mountainous landscape and is covered by 88 1 forests 5 55 farmland 5 21 grassland and 1 14 other landscape types fig 2 the problem of algal bloom has been threatening the xiangxi river every spring since 2003 2 2 computational framework the schematic structure of the proposed computational framework is shown in fig 3 the first step is to calculate the pollutant discharge from individual agricultural sources by using agricultural statistical data and the pollutant export coefficient the loads of tn or tp that were exported from each source per unit time per unit area in the watershed the second step is to obtain the pollutant transport efficiency in river reach by performing swat simulations the pollutant transport efficiency is calculated according to the reach input rich in and output rich out modules in the output file of swat eq 1 which was named the reach transport coefficient indicating the increased or decreased of nutrient flux after transporting through river reach in an individual subbasin 1 reach transport coefficient r i c h o u t r i c h i n the pollutant load at the outlet of each subbasin is the amount that pollutant released to river reach in an individual subbasin before flowing to the reservoir the receiving water body in other words pollutants that were generated from the upstream subbasin will flow through downstream subbasins and finally enter the reservoir the value that decided the final pollutant load released into the reservoir was defined as the pollutant delivery ratio the pollutant delivery ratio of each subbasin was the product of multiple channel migration coefficients all subbasins were passed along to outlet of the watershed li et al 2018a furthermore the pollutant delivery ratios were multiplied by different anps pollution productions to achieve the agricultural pollution intensity for each subbasin 2 3 quantification of pollution released from different agricultural sources the export coefficient approach is used to estimate the accurate pollutant discharge amounts from different agricultural sources including crop cultivation livestock production and rural activities the basic data required are population areas of different crops cultivation and farming activities table s2 the livestock production status such as the kinds amounts and treatment pattern of animal manure table s1 and the pollutant export coefficients of different agricultural sources the data was obtained from the rural survey during july 1st to august 15th in 2014 and the agricultural economic statistics yearbook of each town in 2013 the pollutant export coefficients were based on the first pollution source census table 1 ren et al 2015 dong et al 2011 the equation for the export coefficient is shown as follows 2 k c con c k f 100 where kc is the export coefficient in a certain field con is the pollutant emissions from the conventional treatment kg km 2 ck is the amount of pollutant emissions from the control treatment kg km 2 and f is the application rate of fertilizer kg km 2 livestock and human discharge were determined using the unit load method the export coefficients take sewage and solid waste into account the equation for the export coefficient is shown as follows 3 k p s w 1 η s r u 1 η r where kp is the export coefficient per head kg head 1 feather 1 yr 1 or per person g people 1 d 1 sw is the amount of pollutants produced in waste water kg head 1 feather 1 yr 1 or g people 1 d 1 ηs is the availability ratio of the wastewater ru is the amount of solid waste produced kg head 1 feather 1 yr 1 or g people 1 d 1 and ηr is the availability ratio of solid waste the scope of the rural survey included 11 towns 27 administrative villages and more than 500 households fig s1 the pollutant discharge loads in each subbasin were calculated by using the agricultural production statistical data and the pollutant export coefficients 2 4 model settings since the early 1990s the swat model was developed to perform environmental assessments and the associated impacts on the natural environment that were caused by numerous sources of pollutants specifically nps arnold et al 1993 the swat is a continuous time spatially distributed semiphysically based model that has been widely used to conduct watershed modeling on flow and nutrient processes wang et al 2016 feng et al 2017 guo et al 2018 in the past two decades more than 3000 peer reviewed articles have been published which can be assessed online swat database the swat

because of the sloped cultivation zhang et al 2014 agricultural activities in such mountainous and hilly regions played an important role in affecting the adjacent aquatic systems somura et al 2012 valentina and mike 2015 4 2 migration of agricultural nonpoint pollutants in the watershed in this study typical topographic and climatic conditions cause a high migration speed and low retention ratios of different agricultural nonpoint pollutants over 50 of the area had a slope that ranged from 7 to 25 whereas 37 5 of the area had a slope greater than 25 ding et al 2010 the subtropical monsoon humid climate comes with an average annual precipitation of 1015 mm however precipitation is unevenly distributed through the seasons large amounts of n and p will be washed away by the surface runoff and soil erosion in response to a torrential rainfall event this migration process is evidently different than that of the plateau lake area specifically considerable differences can be found among pollutants that are generated and exported in the system li et al 2018b in the present study small differences were found between pollutants that were generated from the source area and exported at the watershed outlet which were likely due to the small amount of aquatic nutrient retention that occurred during transport fig 8 consequently the distributions of anps pollutant export intensities were the same as the generation intensities figs 6 and 9 high export intensities of tn and tp can be found in the three main tributaries fig 9 a shorter distance between the pollutant sources and water body may enhance or positively relate to the pollutant delivery ratios jim and yang 2006 in addition three main tributaries that contribute a heavy water volume to the reservoir run through these subbasins the developed river network increased the tn and tp loads into the reservoir in contrast the tn and tp delivery ratios of the upstream subbasins are relatively small the reason may be that reaches in the northern region are mostly longer in length therefore pollutant fluxes may gradually decrease from the upper reaches arheimer and brandt 2000 in terms of the nutrient loading that was generated from the sources livestock production was the biggest source for tn while livestock production and crop cultivation dominated the tp loading fig 8 the livestock production source was still the largest contributor of the n pollutant in terms of the export flux at the watershed outlet whereas livestock production and crop cultivation contributed the most p export flux fig 8 5 conclusion identification of the links between individual agricultural sources and water pollution is essential for nps pollution control however the relative contributions of agricultural sources to the nutrient export fluxes at the watershed scale are poorly understood due to the difficulties in quantifying the nutrient flux at the outlet of the watershed that was derived from an individual source by the incorporation of eca and swat livestock production was identified as the dominant anps of tn while the majority of the tp export flux was from livestock production and crop cultivation agricultural pollutants that were retained in hilly and mountainous regions were relatively low as a result the anps pollutant generation and export were all concentrated in the downstream of the three main tributaries thus the primary task for water quality improvement is to strengthen the agricultural source control enforcement of regulations or laws of nps pollution in the middle and the downstream of the xiangxi river watershed the results of the contribution of anps pollution to the watershed can support identification of the critical agricultural source and the associated management practices in this study three gorges reservoir region it was suggested to develop programs for household septic tanks to collect livestock production and rural sewage in rural areas and in small towns along two sides of the three tributaries more hedgerows or buffer belts need to be built to prevent nonpoint pollutants from entering the rivers in addition the proposed framework swat eca can be further implemented in other parts of the world for an environmental assessment the proposed work will alleviate the exposure of livestock excrement to the air whereas it will directly release polluting gases into the air or be washed away by the rain declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

6652,karst aquifers are dynamic hydrologic systems which can be sensitive to short term recharge events storms and heterogeneous recharge characteristics point recharge at sinks irregular soil thicknesses in this study two adjacent karst springs tippery spring and near tippery spring were monitored to better understand flow and source mixing characteristics in response to two storms in may and june 2017 monitoring techniques included high resolution discharge and temperature logging and collection of spring water using automatic samplers to analyze chemical parameters such as stable water isotopes and mg ca ratios along with ca zr ratios and rare earth elements rees which have had limited testing in karst systems the two springs exhibited behaviors which were both unique to each spring and shared depending on which parameter is considered spring specific behaviors included discharge and isotopic response with tippery spring having a flashier and faster conduit flow behavior relative to near tippery spring s delayed storm response absolute mg ca values were spring specific owing to the relative fraction of limestone and dolostone in their respective recharge areas although both springs showed similar mg ca ratio shifts after storms while ca zr ratios changed in timing and intensity with storm intensity both springs exhibited a decline in ca zr ratios as calcium rich carbonate matrix water was displaced by zirconium rich storm recharge water from sinking streams off the clastic upland ridges flushing of recharged storm water resulted in an increase in total ree concentrations at both springs from 0 15 ppb to 1 0 ppb with the timing and magnitude of concentration increases determined by the degree of surface connectivity intrinsic to each spring and the intensity of the recharge event rees and ca zr ratios provided additional and complementary tracer techniques to better understand transient recharge and flow behaviors in karst springs keywords karst karst spring rare earth elements storm hydrograph flow mixing valley and ridge province 1 background 1 1 assessing transient behaviors in karst as conduits make karst aquifers particularly vulnerable to contamination from a variety of sources quantifying the proportion of conduit flow is essential to aquifer protection the karst aquifer network and clastic sediments within serve not only as transmission pathways for contaminants but also as long and short term storage reservoirs for contaminants numerous approaches exist to characterize the structure and behavior of karst aquifers to address the inherent uncertainties in these complex hydrologic systems mangin 1994 padilla et al 1994 larocque et al 1998 pinault et al 2001 white 2002 bakalowicz 2005 goldscheider 2015 scanlon and thrailkill 1987 these approaches have included correlations between surficial karst features and flow kresic 1995 hydrological modeling approaches hill and polyak 2010 dye tracing goldscheider et al 2008 geophysical methods schwartz and schreiber 2009 and spring monitoring desmarais and rojstaczer 2002 temperature and specific conductance are easily measured with relatively inexpensive easily deployable data loggers allowing for the collection of high frequency data sets over long periods of time monitoring physiochemical parameters of spring water both seasonally and in response to storm events is an especially useful means to understanding karst aquifer behaviors short term and seasonal variations in spring water chemistry can provide insight into source water mixing and ground water residence times feeding a spring as such many attempts have been made to characterize karst springs based on their discharge and physiochemical parameters one of the earlier spring classifications by shuster and white 1971 used temperature and major ion chemistry to classify springs as conduit flow dominant and matrix flow dominant more recent studies have further sought to classify and characterize other elements of flow behavior such as vadose vs phreatic storage using stable water isotopic analysis lakey and krothe 1996 fast flow and slow flow components based on discharge recession curves doctor et al 2005 localized vs distributed recharge based on spring temperature patterns luhmann et al 2011 and conduit flow vs matrix flow components based on mg ca ratios during storm flow toran and reisch 2013 goldscheider 2015 pointed out the need for multiple tracers such as dyes to determine fast flow paths and natural tracers such as stable water isotopes for slow flow paths lack of variation in isotope signals during storm events has been used as evidence of mixing of fast and slow paths not indicated by other tracers winston and criss 2004 schwarz et al 2009 thicker soil cover leading to slower recharge has been used to explain some isotope mixing zhao et al 2018 the lag between discharge response and conductivity response has been used to estimate travel times birk et al 2004 seasonal variation in mixing along flow paths has been demonstrated by discriminant factor analysis of major ions and mg ca ratio in a study by bicalho et al 2012 chloride and specific conductance have been used to evaluate variations in contributions such as activation of deeper flow paths ravbar et al 2011 martin et al 2016 while these approaches allowed for improved conceptual models of karst aquifers critical knowledge gaps still remain regarding recharge and flow paths within a karst system we classify karst flow systems to better understand the complex pathways formed by the fast flow paths in conduits and slow flow paths through the matrix in actuality the matrix comprises both primary and fracture porosity and permeability resulting in a flow system that is a continuum from larger to smaller openings and from conduit to diffuse flow thus the discharge chemistry reflects output from varied recharge fast flow paths slow flow paths and flow paths that result from mixing of conduit and matrix water to move beyond using end members to describe flow paths it is important to evaluate multiple storm events and use multiple tracers to capture these variations 1 2 rare earth elements as natural tracers rare earth elements rees show potential for determining recharge zones and flow paths in karst aquifers rees are a group of elements comprising the lanthanide series lanthanum la cerium ce praseodymium pr neodymium nd promethium pm samarium sm europium eu gadolinium gd terbium tb dysprosium dy holmium ho erbium er thulium tm ytterbium yb and lutetium lu plus scandium sc and yttrium y henderson 1984 the main chemical difference throughout the lanthanide series is the progressive shrinking in ionic radius from 115 pm la to 93 pm lu which imparts distinct behaviors in their fractionation and incorporation into minerals white 2015 due to the similar ionic radii between neighboring rees they tend to maintain similar relative abundances in nature despite significantly variable absolute abundances with the exception of cerium which can have a 2 valence and europium which can have a 4 valence the rees have a 3 valence the variable valence state for cerium and europium allows them to fractionate relative to their neighbors under certain environmental conditions such as redox variations making them useful natural geochemical tracers leybourne and johannesson 2008 ree patterns from host materials can also be transferred to water providing a useful tool for tracing recharge areas and flow paths playà et al 2007 hydrological studies have used rees to better understand flow paths through water rock interactions johannesson et al 1997 tang and johannesson 2006 göb et al 2013 recharge conditions möller et al 2006 tweed et al 2006 willis and johannesson 2011 and transport ingri et al 2000 pourret et al 2010 in an early study johannesson et al 1997 observed the unique ree patterns of carbonate and felsic rocks were imparted in waters recharging through them allowing for groundwater mixing to be assessed between the two sources further along in their flow paths möller et al 2006 also noted the imparting of lithological ree patterns on groundwater in a region with variable basalt basalt limestone limestone and gypsum dominated recharge areas willis and johannesson 2011 observed homogeneous flat shale normalized ree patterns and groundwater compositions throughout an aquifer indicating relatively homogeneous recharge patterns through shale weathered bulk sediments ingri et al 2000 reported on the positive relationship between ree concentrations and sediment weathering with a strong linear correlation being noted between ree concentrations and dissolved aluminum al derived from al rich sediments other authors such as tang and johannesson 2006 measured dissolved ree concentrations throughout a sand aquifer which generally decreased in concentration indicating changes in redox and ph conditions along flow paths tweed et al 2006 explored changing ree patterns along an aquifer s flow paths noting increased ree concentrations when ph conditions were lowest 6 1 typically near the aquifer s recharge area with decreasing ree concentrations as ph increased downgradient studies on the mobility of rees such as by pourret et al 2010 have noted the tendency for rees to be sorbed and strongly mobilized with colloids in addition to variable concentrations göb et al 2013 reported on the presence of negative cerium ce anomalies in oxidized waters due the variable oxidation states of ce controlling its mobility studies exploring ree transport and temporal variability though are still limited ingri et al 2000 pourret et al 2010 gill et al 2018 additionally the relative significance and complexity of the factors controlling ree patterns in hydrologic systems such as redox ph colloidal transport and host rock contribution are still not entirely understood noack et al 2014 duvert et al 2015 the application of rees to better understand flow paths and recharge makes them promising tools in karst aquifers which are inherently complex johannesson et al 2000 observed that shale normalized ree patterns in aquifer water reflected that of the host rock with carbonate rocks exhibiting heavy ree enrichment and negative ce anomalies gill et al 2018 used contrasting ree ratios e g pr yb y ho between limestone and sandstone in a lowland karst network to determine varying recharge contributions from each lithology zhou et al 2012 identified middle rare earth element mree enrichment in stalagmites related to changing recharge conditions through the overlying soil layer toran et al 2018 used rees to identify springs with a greater contribution to discharge from slow flow through the carbonate bedrock matrix subdued ree signatures were observed after rain events in karst springs filippini et al 2018 despite these results more research is needed especially into behaviors unique to karst systems such as temporal variability and recharge heterogeneity for this study the two adjacent springs were analyzed for natural tracers these tracers can provide a more complete understanding of source area recharge and flow behavior feeding the two springs 2 study site two karst springs tippery and near tippery were chosen for storm response monitoring fig 1 these springs have been included in historic and recent research for examining the similarities and differences in their recharge and flow behaviors their separate yet adjacent capture areas provide identical rainfall conditions since the springs are only 65 m apart but allow for comparison of recharge and flow path differences located within the folded and faulted valley and ridge province of central pennsylvania s nittany valley the two springs emerge from the foot of canoe mountain a topographic ridge which merges with brush mountain and bald eagle mountain to the west which form the western boundary of the allegheny front berg et al 1980 canoe mountain forms the axis of a syncline with silurian and ordovician sandstones forming the ridges and ordovician shales and carbonates forming the flank and foot of the ridge respectively minor streams off the ridge typically flow after storms although some streams such as tippery sink are perennial these streams often feed sinkholes in the carbonate rocks which in turn feed nearby springs tippery spring has been traced to three upland sinkholes while near tippery spring has been traced to one sinkhole with no observed cross over between capture areas hull 1980 dye trace travel times were less than 48 h for tippery spring and less than 72 h for near tippery spring both springs show similar baseflow discharges of 0 14 0 28 m3 sec with storm flow discharges up to 0 85 m3 sec shuster and white 1971 the drainage area of each spring is estimated to be around 3 4 km2 extending up to the ridgetop herman et al 2009 hull 1980 the springs are at an elevation of 274 m msl with a capture area extending up to the ridge top of 396 m both springs have variable discharge temperature and chemistry at the seasonal scale shuster and white 1971 and storm response scale herman et al 2009 a study by berglund et al 2018 re examined tippery spring and near tippery spring from the shuster and white 1971 study by comparing stable water isotope chemistry after storm recharge the results revealed recharge behaviors which were dependent on both the size of the storm and the intrinsic recharge characteristics of each spring for a given storm size tippery spring showed a flashier storm hydrograph response than near tippery spring which translated into a relatively greater portion of storm water based on stable water isotopes in contrast near tippery spring had a buffered stable water isotope response showing a lesser overall portion of storm water spread across the hydrograph along with high resolution data these results allowed for a greater understanding of the two springs recharge and flow behaviors 3 methods 3 1 spring monitoring water temperature and pressure were recorded at 15 minute intervals using onset hobo

acid washed bottles collected spring water samples triggered by rising spring water level in response to each storm the 24 samples at each spring were collected over the course of 24 h with a higher initial sampling rate every 30 min then progressively slower frequency to every 2 h to capture more variable initial geochemical signatures isco bottles were recovered within 1 3 days after the storm when possible grab samples were also collected before and after the storm all water samples were filtered with 0 45 μm nitrocellulose paper and refrigerated in headspace free bottles until analysis as

of 2 54 cm two days prior to the may 2017 storm event a slight drizzle 1 25 cm fell on the study site as such slightly wet antecedent conditions prevailed at the onset of the sampling event 7 day api 2 94 the water sampling period continued until 16 30 est on may 6 2017 due to the wet antecedent conditions discharges at tippery spring and near tippery spring were slightly elevated above their average annual base flow values 0 03 m3 s and 0 01 m3 s respectively to 0 11 m3 s and 0 09 m3 s respectively in response to the storm tippery spring reached a peak flow of 0 86 m3 s fourteen hours after the start of rainfall and receded to 0 49 m3 s by the end of sampling near tippery spring reached a peak flow of 0 46 m3 s fifteen hours after the start of rainfall with a variable discharge plateau 0 37 0 49 m3 s for the remainder of the sampling period the june 2017 storm fell during two pulses the first beginning on june 15 2017 at 19 00 est and depositing 5 30 cm of rain over 7 h and the second beginning on june 16 2017 at 16 00 est depositing 2 30 cm of rain over 2 h spring water sampling continued until 1 30 est on june 17 little to no rainfall occurred prior to the june 2017 storm 7 day api 0 06 due to the dry antecedent conditions discharges at tippery spring and near tippery spring initially had their annual average base flow values of 0 03 m3 s and 0 01 m3 s respectively in response to the storm tippery spring reached a peak flow of 1 20 m3 s seven hours after the onset of rainfall and recovered to 0 23 m3 s twelve hours later then peaked again at 1 19 m3 s three hours after the beginning of the second period of rainfall and recovered slightly to 0 95 m3 s by the end of the sampling period near tippery spring reached a peak flow of 0 59 m3 s seven hours after the first occurrence of rainfall recovered to 0 39 m3 s ten hours later then peaked again at 0 61 m3 s six hours after the second onset of rainfall near tippery recovered slightly to 0 53 m3 s by the end of the sampling period 4 2 storm chemographs 4 2 1 parameter groupings water level calibrated to discharge at a weir temperature and ph were measured using dataloggers which provided high resolution and easily retrievable indicators of storm water arrival at the springs total suspended solids tss specific conductance sc alkalinity calcite saturation index sic and stable water isotopes δ2h δ18o were analyzed from water samples as they provide information on spring chemistry changes during storm flow such as matrix water dilution carbonate rock dissolution and saturation and parsing of isotopically distinct pre storm water and storm water fractions in addition this study examined the temporal variations in molar mg ca ratios and ca zr ratios and metals such as fe and zr and rees mg ca ratios indicate varying conduit matrix water interactions as matrix water tends to have higher mg ca ratios than conduit water metals were analyzed to further explore their relationship with ree mobility and concentration zr was selected as a potential indicator of upland source waters as zr concentrations in the upland sandstones and shales are found in higher concentrations than in the local carbonate rocks from whole rock analysis 131 ppm and 16 ppm respectively as similarly noted by hua et al 2013 ca zr ratios were explored as an indicator of recharged storm water from the clastic upland ridges which are enriched in zr and depleted in ca relative to the carbonate bedrock both δ2h δ18o fell linearly along the local meteoric water line so only δ2h is shown in chemographs for each spring chemographs were produced from continuous loggers and samples from automatic sampling along with grab samples during post storm baseflow conditions figs 4 7 certain parameters varied together in the chemographs for both springs and there were different patterns for the parameter groups being carbonate springs with high ca concentrations the chemical parameters sc alkalinity and sic tended to vary together with the mg ca ratio showing similar variability but a slightly more complex response stable water isotopes and ca zr ratios also showed similar timing to these chemical parameters in the initial response but differed later in the hydrograph tss metals total rees and the ce anomaly grouped together based on their similar timing suggesting transport with or as sediment for these constituents temperature and ph varied from storm to storm and did not show similar timing to the other variables temperature sometimes showed a storm pulse although long term temperature logger data showed that not all storm events have a temperature signal toran et al 2018 little change in temperature was observed during the may storm at either spring due to the relatively small size of the storm and lack of temperature contrast between the storm water and ambient ground water in contrast the june storm resulted in a notable temperature change at both springs due to a greater amount of rainfall and a greater temperature contrast between storm water and ambient ground water producing a temperature spike for each storm pulse at tippery spring and a gradual increase at near tippery spring 4 2 2 pre storm conditions pre storm conditions varied for both springs before the two storms may pre storm concentrations were likely a consequence of the wet antecedent conditions prior to the may storm fig 4 for tippery and fig 6 for near tippery this included elevated tss and dissolved metals fe zr slightly enriched stable isotope values decreased sc alkalinity ca zr ratio and calcite si the pre storm water chemistry prior to the june storm was more typical of baseflow samples for both springs during this study and from previous historical sampling shuster and white 1971 in addition the initial mg ca ratio differed between the two springs for both storms tippery spring s pre storm water chemistry parameters showed low mg ca ratios reflecting the predominantly limestone flow path area while near tippery spring had a higher overall mg ca ratio due to the relatively greater fraction of dolomite within its flow path fig 1 4 2 3 tippery spring chemographs at tippery spring during both storms a brief approximately 1 hour spike in ph sc alkalinity and sic signaled the initial arrival of storm water this increase was likely flushing of older more concentrated water stored in the system figs 4 and 5 this spike occurred just before the stable isotope signal of storm water indicated by rising δ2h partway through the rising limb of the discharge hydrograph the mg ca ratio also spiked although slightly delayed from the other initial responses as the storm water isotope signal arrived sc and alkalinity became diluted followed by a gradual recovery for the may storm fig 4 for the june storm the same initial dilution from arriving storm water was observed but the larger storm resulted in a slightly longer dilution period and more gradual recovery that was interrupted by a second storm event fig 5 the mg ca ratio followed these trends with slight differences during the may storm the dilution period for mg ca was slightly longer than for sc and other dissolved constituents and the recovery was slower as well the timing of the mg ca ratio also differed from other dissolved constituents in the june storm there was a larger initial increase possibly piston flow component of older water and a delay in the dilution phase the second storm water pulse during the june storm produced a second increase in mg ca the ca zr ratio and the stable water isotope signature followed inverse trends ca zr decreased along with other chemical parameters as the δ2h increased however these two parameters showed a slower recovery compared to the other dissolved constituents the arrival of the storm pulse at tippery spring was accompanied by an increase in tss trace metals shown by fe and zr and total rees this increase began at the same time as the isotope storm water increase but peaked slightly later then showed an asymmetrical long tail decline that lingered longer than other dissolved constituents the ce anomaly followed a similar pattern but returned to pre storm baseflow values sooner than the total rees and metals figs 4 and 5 4 2 4 near tippery spring chemographs near tippery showed a similar grouping of dissolved constituent response and sediment parameter response but with slightly different timing figs 6 and 7 the initial storm signal arrived later in the discharge hydrograph after the peak for both the may and the june storms there was no initial spike as observed at tippery in several parameters however for the june storm a signal from additional overland flow was observed initially this overland flow was triggered by the larger june storm and was indicated by a rapid storm signal increase in storm water stable isotopes temperature and sediment along with dilution of dissolved constituents the overland flow mixing with spring flow has been observed for large storms during site visits the separate arrival of groundwater storm discharge at near tippery spring was indicated by a decrease in the dissolved constituents sc alkalinity sic ca zr ratio and mg ca ratio and an increase in the stable water isotope signature during the may storm dilution in the dissolved constituents was followed by a rebound to concentrations above the baseflow conditions except for ca zr then a gradual decline back to baseflow levels on the falling limb of the hydrograph during the june storm recovery did not rebound to concentrations above the baseflow conditions the timing of the changes in mg ca ratio for the may storm was similar to the other parameters however for the june storm the mg ca ratio responded faster relative to the other parameters and a rise in mg ca was seen for the second storm pulse in june the ca zr ratio and the isotope signature both showed a slower recovery to baseflow values than other chemical parameters for both storms the sediment associated parameters tss fe zr and rees showed the same pattern at tippery spring and near tippery spring with an increase on the rising limb and an asymmetrical decrease on the falling limb 4 2 5 comparison of storm responses the timing and degree of response varied based on the size of the storm event the larger june storm vs the weaker may storm and the intrinsic nature of recharge of each spring s capture area tippery spring having a larger storm water recharge volume compared to near tippery spring as indicated by stable isotopes berglund et al 2018 the dilution and recovery was more gradual at near tippery spring than at tippery spring and more gradual for the larger june storm compared to the smaller may storm the tss metal and ree concentrations also increase later at near tippery spring than at tippery spring and recovered more gradually than the chemical parameters at both springs 4 3 spring ree spidergrams during storm response with the exception of europium all individual ree concentrations were above detection limits albeit at low concentrations paas normalized plots of individual ree concentrations for a single water sample called spidergrams illustrated internal ree trends and anomalies resulting from geochemical processes and water rock interactions in the may storm where pre and post storm samples were available for clear comparison with baseflow water chemistry figs 8 and 9 only the may storm was selected here due to the availability of pre and post storm samples to make inferences about lingering effects of storms on ree characteristics baseflow sampling of select carbonate springs in pennsylvania including tippery spring and near tippery spring for cerium anomalies suggested that springs with a greater component of slow matrix flow contain more prominent negative cerium anomalies ce 1 toran et al 2018 this relationship was further explored here where relative contributions of faster conduit flow and slower matrix flow varied in response to storm recharge for tippery spring fig 8 ree patterns during pre storm flow had low ree concentrations with a slightly negative cerium anomaly there was also a non detect of europium time a the apparent europium anomaly during baseflow conditions is the result of being near or below detection limit instead of association with the carbonate bedrock and its behavior is not considered further here at peak ree concentrations time b there were no cerium anomalies as ree concentrations began to drop to pre storm levels time c the slightly negative cerium anomaly returned at the time where other spring chemistry parameters recovered time d ree concentrations were still slightly elevated above their pre storm values despite other indicators of slow matrix flow contributions flow contribution a strong cerium anomaly was not seen at tippery spring during any period of storm response this further highlights tippery spring s greater conduit flow influence even during baseflow but also suggests that a cerium anomaly may be a sensitive indicator of conduit flow mixing with slow matrix flow during storm recovery for near tippery spring fig 9 ree patterns during pre storm flow time a were similar to tippery spring having low overall ree concentrations and non detect of europium but differed by having a notably negative cerium anomaly this cerium anomaly discrepancy between the two springs was also observed in the baseflow sampling toran et al 2018 during peak ree concentrations in response to storm flow time b the cerium anomaly was eliminated a slight return of the cerium anomaly was observed during the ree concentration recovery time c ree concentrations remained slightly elevated with the return of the cerium anomaly time d after other chemical parameters have recovered the presence of the negative cerium anomaly during baseflow suggests carbonate bedrock interaction and its subsequent anomaly neutralization during storm flow suggests faster flow paths storm water rees had similar ree patterns to the paas shale standard with no enrichment in light middle or heavy rees lree mree hree but instead showed a relatively flat pattern the lack of anomalies and similar ree pattern to the paas shale standard further support that stormflow ree enrichment is sourced in the detrital clastics upgradient feeding into the carbonate sinkholes rather than in the carbonate rocks themselves 5 discussion the two springs shared a similar cycle of storm response characterized by three distinct periods fig 10 the three periods are similar for each storm but nonetheless there are distinctions between the two springs there were differences in arrival times of storm pulses for the two springs and longer recovery times for the larger storm the differences between these three periods provide evidence for mixing along their recharge and flow paths period 1 piston flow spring discharge rises shortly after rainfall due to a piston flow effect from increased pressure head in the recharge area no geochemical variation in spring mouth chemistry occurred at near tippery spring during this period while a short spike in chemical parameters occurred at tippery spring indicating purging of older more concentrated pre storm water which has been observed in other karst springs birk et al 2004 ravbar et al 2011 ryan and meiman 1996 the purging of older water and faster flow response at tippery spring are indicative of faster flow paths in contrast near tippery s discharge showed mixing between source waters derived from both fast and slow flow responses period 2 arrival of storm water from a combination of faster and slower flow dominated recharge this period begins with the arrival of fast flow storm water through conduits connected to surface runoff from the ridge tops this storm water pulse was indicated by signatures such as an enrichment in stable water isotope values and dilution of chemical parameters including ca zr the dilute storm water was then replaced by water from slower flow paths signaled by an increase in sc alkalinity sic and mg ca ratio mixing of waters from fast and slow flow paths was observed however based on different patterns in the timing of chemical parameters in previous studies mixing induced by storms has been observed by cl fluctuation in the chemograph mitrofan et al 2015 by age dating martin et al 2016 by isotope tracers schwarz et al 2009 and by variation in temperature and sc particularly at low flow periods filippini et al 2018 the timing of period 2 differs between tippery spring and near tippery spring tippery spring showed storm water on the rising limb of the hydrograph for near tippery spring period 2 begins 4 6 h after the peak flow plateau is reached with storm water gradually rising to a maximum about 12 h after peak flow this slower response is likely due to near tippery spring s decreased conduit flow portion in discharge creating a flow buffering capacity the slightly different timing in mg ca ratios at both springs compared to the other chemical parameters suggested that mixing can be complex as mg ca increases more contact with the matrix is inferred while faster flow paths are inferred from mg ca decreases there were both increases and decreases in the mg ca ratio observed in period 2 we detailed the mg ca ratio because it is an important example of mixing as conduits vary from larger to smaller openings varying degrees of interaction occur with the matrix furthermore different recharge events can capture from varying areas also creating variable mixtures thus at near tippery spring during the may storm the mg ca ratio declined at a similar time as sc and other dissolved constituents but showed an earlier decline than sc in the june storm at tippery spring mg ca ratios took longer to recover than sc and other chemical parameters for the may storm for the june storm mg ca increased while sc decreased indicating a stronger matrix component possibly indicating a piston flow pulse of older water this piston flow component may explain the delayed dilute storm water signature in mg ca ratios thus period 2 showed both increases and decreases in mg ca ratios at tippery spring which provided evidence of mixing of fast and slow flow paths all parameters showed a more extended storm signal and recovery for the larger june storm as expected the june storm resulted in about two times more discharge than the may storm at tippery spring and nearly three times more discharge at near tippery spring the dilution factors and recovery periods differed more between the may and june storms at near tippery even though the flow is the more buffered at this spring the contrast in discharge between the two storms and larger dilution reflects the slower travel times to near tippery spring mg ca ratios varied more than sc and other dissolved constituents thus each spring has storm to storm differences in response indicating that flow paths include varied portions of conduit and slow components depending on the storm a more buffered spring may require longer sampling periods to capture chemograph variations and faster flow paths require finer time intervals recharge source area parameters also appear during this period such as an increase in tss which signaled flushing of surface sediments and the decrease in ca zr ratios which indicated the arrival of waters interacting with zr rich and ca poor ridgetop sediments feeding sinks and sinkholes parameters associated with sediments such as rees and metals also increased during this period this study pointed out that ion ratios can better indicate chemical variations that tag source areas ca zr and matrix components mg ca period 3 recovery to new base flow fed by slower matrix dominated flow paths the third period was marked by a decline in tss and metals for the may storm there was more tss variation in the june storm and recovery was interrupted by a second storm so a distinct period 3 was not observed at either spring the length of time for recovery was difficult to estimate with the gap between automated sampler measurements and the second storm event in june although for a given rainfall event tippery spring showed a shorter recovery time than near tippery spring for both storms the ree concentrations retained a storm pulse signal i e slightly elevated concentration longer than tss and chemical parameters in the recovery period spring discharge also remained elevated as the water chemistry returned to concentrations similar to pre storm periods high mg ca sic closer to saturation in addition to the high discharge the stable water isotopes and ca zr ratio were slow to recover to pre storm conditions the long tail of recovery for these components provides further evidence of mixing of flow paths and storm water input that extends further than indicated by the dilution and recovery of dissolved constituents such as sc in summary although these periods in the hydrographs and chemographs of karst springs have been identified in previous studies e g ford and williams 2007 ravbar et al 2011 the analysis here pointed out additional complexity in the arrival of storm water in period 2 by examining multiple tracers these mixing patterns were identified as well as storm to storm variations the importance of continuous monitoring including the tail of the hydrograph was also reinforced by the monitoring at these adjacent springs variations in age and mixing in springs that are in close proximity have been identified previously particularly at low flow martin et al 2016 filippini et al 2018 but the distances were on the order of kilometers in this study the springs were only 65 m apart and still showed distinct responses in the storm chemographs 5 1 ca zr ratios as indicators of storm recharge source area one relationship which stood out during storm water arrival was the ratio between ca and zr in relation to stable water isotope storm water fraction comparing ca zr ratios to storm water fraction determined from stable water isotopes berglund et al 2018 showed a mixing relationship between pre storm water with a high ca zr ratio and a storm water component with low ca zr fig 11 prior to the influence of storm recharge base flow matrix water contained elevated ca relative to zr as the carbonate bedrock contains little detrital zr contributing to stored water during storm flow a drop in ca zr ratio corresponded to the arrival of storm water as indicated from the stable water isotopes this ratio decrease during the arrival of storm water was due to the concurrent decrease of ca concentration and increase in zr concentration the decrease in ca concentration was due to the flushing and dilution of high ca matrix water by recharging storm water which contains little to no ca in contrast zr concentrations increased with increasing storm water component this increased zr concentration likely resulted from storm water having interacted with surficial clastic sediments with elevated concentrations of zr relative to the carbonates these clastic sediments are transported after storms by the sinking streams draining the clastic ridge tops which feed into sinkholes within the carbonate rock at the foot of the hills as a result ca zr ratios provided both a useful indicator of storm water arrival along with source of recharge water as the analyzed water samples included materials below 0 45 μm ca and zr are transported in both dissolved and colloidal phases 5 2 rare earth element ree concentrations during storm flow during period 1 and period 3 total ree concentrations in both springs were lowest 0 10 0 15 ppb during period 2 with the arrival of storm water total ree concentrations increase at both springs up to 1 30 ppb total ree concentrations in spring water showed a strong positive correlation with zr and fe concentrations fig 12 increased total ree concentrations also appear to be influenced by the intensity of recharge and surface connectivity with a relatively greater ree increase during the larger june storm than the may storm and a relatively greater ree increase for tippery spring than near tippery spring during pre storm and matrix flow conditions total ree concentrations were consistently low indicating minor contribution from carbonate matrix dissolution furthermore there was a weaker cerium anomaly at tippery spring which further highlights tippery spring s greater conduit flow influence but also suggests that a cerium anomaly may be a sensitive indicator of conduit flow mixing with slower matrix flow during storm recovery total ree increased with zr indicating rees are introduced into the aquifer during storm flow sourced from the same areas as the zr bearing sediments namely the high zr low ca clastic ridge tops feeding into the sinkholes total ree concentrations correlated well with the relative fraction of matrix water and storm water with increased total rees occurring with a greater storm water fraction fig 13 the lowest ree concentrations 0 15 ppb occurred in spring water with the greatest pre storm water fraction signature pre storm baseflow samples with the arrival of storm water after rain events ree concentrations increased with increasing storm water component to the springs with the greatest ree concentrations 0 8 ppb occurring near maximum storm water fraction although these relationships generally held true for both springs when the pre storm water or storm water fractions dominated the transition from low to high ree concentrations as the slower matrix flow mixedwith the faster conduit flow storm water was not smooth between storm water fractions of 0 3 0 7 total ree concentrations were highly variable between the maximum and minimum concentrations seen during high matrix water fraction and high storm water fraction respectively this imperfect transition is likely due to irregular ree mobility from changing ph and redox conditions from mixing water sources after a storm but could also be the result of recharge source area heterogeneities affecting ree mobility in different source areas 6 conclusions 6 1 storm response characteristics of tippery and near tippery springs first analyzed for flow characterization by shuster and white 1971 tippery spring and near tippery spring were classified as conduit flow dominated springs based on their seasonally variable water temperature and chemistry while being classified as conduit flow it was also noted that the springs exhibited distinct behaviors despite their close proximity using high resolution logging and water sampling in response to storms these springs were re examined to better define the varying degrees of faster conduit flow and slower flow along with multiple recharge modes for the two springs of the two springs tippery spring exhibited more dominant fast flow conduit behavior through rapid storm response and recovery of discharge and chemistry while near tippery spring exhibited a relatively delayed storm response buffered geochemistry and drawn out recovery these comparative differences between the two springs were maintained during the smaller may 2017 storm and the larger june 2017 storm indicating behaviors intrinsic to the natural recharge and flow characteristic of each spring s recharge area rather than storm intensity or antecedent conditions despite the inherent differences both springs did experience a similar sequence of storm response characteristics marked by the following periods period 1 storm piston pulse period 2 storm water arrival including varying degrees of faster conduit dominant flow and slower matrix dominant flow and period 3 post storm recovery the relative timing and duration of these three flow periods were a function of the intrinsic nature of recharge and flow for each spring along with storm intensity a larger storm produced a greater period 2 duration and a stronger surface connection such as tippery spring had a relatively shorter period 1 duration and greater period 2 conduit flow phase the nature of these periods unique to each spring has important hydrological implications such as water sampling intervals and contaminant storage and transport a spring with near tippery s characteristics with a longer recovery should be sampled longer while tippery spring needs a finer interval to capture different pulses of storm water furthermore constituents associated with sediment transport showed a longer recovery and should be sampled for a longer time to better understand their transport behavior 6 2 new tracers for recharge and flow paths two natural tracers were applied in new ways for this study ca zr ratios and ree patterns both tracers provided additional information about flow paths and recharge sources as they varied during the storm hydrograph stable water isotopes directly indicated the arrival of storm water to the springs while ca zr ratios provided insight into recharge area source and timing these patterns and results may be shared among other karst systems with allogenic recharge from siliciclastic areas while karst systems with autogenic recharge may show muted response in these tracers due to greater flow path lengths and more buffered storm recharge behavior during pre storm baseflow high ca zr ratios reflected water which has dominantly interacted with the carbonate host rock with the arrival of storm water ca zr ratios dropped as the previously elevated ca concentrations from storage became diluted by storm water while zr concentrations increased from the influx of storm water which had interacted with clastic surface sediments as a storm water arrival indicator in clastic ridge fed valley and ridge springs this relationship made ca zr ratios a useful substitute for stable water isotopes while also providing information on source area an advantage of the ca zr signature is that zr analysis is typically provided with other trace elements whereas stable water isotopes typically require extensive sampling to develop a local meteoric water line and additional analytical techniques ree concentrations were lowest 0 15 ppb at both springs during baseflow conditions in response to storm water recharge ree concentrations increased with the arrival of storm water ree spidergrams varied throughout different periods of storm response for these springs ree patterns during periods of little storm water influence periods 1 and 3 exhibited negative cerium anomalies which were weak tippery spring to moderate near tippery spring this behavior coincided with the conceptual model of tippery spring being inherently more conduit flow dominated while near tippery spring is inherently more affected by slower flow during periods of surficial sediment recharge period 2 the ree patterns exhibited neutral ce 1 cerium anomalies suggesting the storm recharged sediment was derived from the clastic rocks along the ridges rather than the local carbonate bedrock elevated ree concentrations persisting after other parameters recovered to pre storm levels suggested slower flow paths recharging the two springs which was less apparent with the other parameters these results illustrate the sensitivity of ree concentrations and anomalies in karst springs to storm events recharge areas and flow paths even as other storm flow indicators e g stable water isotopes tss mg ca ratios may have subsided elevated ree concentrations and altered cerium anomalies may linger for an extended period of time as such the presence of low ree concentrations along with a pronounced cerium anomaly may be a good indicator of matrix affected recharge and storm flow recovery to a spring elevated ree concentrations after a storm along with neutralized cerium anomaly differentiate between water which has interacted with either the local carbonate matrix or the upland siliciclastics this study illustrated the relationships among multiple tracers to understand source waters in different periods of storm hydrographs ree concentrations along with other parameters such as stable water isotopes mg ca and ca zr ratios provided a more complete understanding of karst flow and recharge paths and showed how

6652,karst aquifers are dynamic hydrologic systems which can be sensitive to short term recharge events storms and heterogeneous recharge characteristics point recharge at sinks irregular soil thicknesses in this study two adjacent karst springs tippery spring and near tippery spring were monitored to better understand flow and source mixing characteristics in response to two storms in may and june 2017 monitoring techniques included high resolution discharge and temperature logging and collection of spring water using automatic samplers to analyze chemical parameters such as stable water isotopes and mg ca ratios along with ca zr ratios and rare earth elements rees which have had limited testing in karst systems the two springs exhibited behaviors which were both unique to each spring and shared depending on which parameter is considered spring specific behaviors included discharge and isotopic response with tippery spring having a flashier and faster conduit flow behavior relative to near tippery spring s delayed storm response absolute mg ca values were spring specific owing to the relative fraction of limestone and dolostone in their respective recharge areas although both springs showed similar mg ca ratio shifts after storms while ca zr ratios changed in timing and intensity with storm intensity both springs exhibited a decline in ca zr ratios as calcium rich carbonate matrix water was displaced by zirconium rich storm recharge water from sinking streams off the clastic upland ridges flushing of recharged storm water resulted in an increase in total ree concentrations at both springs from 0 15 ppb to 1 0 ppb with the timing and magnitude of concentration increases determined by the degree of surface connectivity intrinsic to each spring and the intensity of the recharge event rees and ca zr ratios provided additional and complementary tracer techniques to better understand transient recharge and flow behaviors in karst springs keywords karst karst spring rare earth elements storm hydrograph flow mixing valley and ridge province 1 background 1 1 assessing transient behaviors in karst as conduits make karst aquifers particularly vulnerable to contamination from a variety of sources quantifying the proportion of conduit flow is essential to aquifer protection the karst aquifer network and clastic sediments within serve not only as transmission pathways for contaminants but also as long and short term storage reservoirs for contaminants numerous approaches exist to characterize the structure and behavior of karst aquifers to address the inherent uncertainties in these complex hydrologic systems mangin 1994 padilla et al 1994 larocque et al 1998 pinault et al 2001 white 2002 bakalowicz 2005 goldscheider 2015 scanlon and thrailkill 1987 these approaches have included correlations between surficial karst features and flow kresic 1995 hydrological modeling approaches hill and polyak 2010 dye tracing goldscheider et al 2008 geophysical methods schwartz and schreiber 2009 and spring monitoring desmarais and rojstaczer 2002 temperature and specific conductance are easily measured with relatively inexpensive easily deployable data loggers allowing for the collection of high frequency data sets over long periods of time monitoring physiochemical parameters of spring water both seasonally and in response to storm events is an especially useful means to understanding karst aquifer behaviors short term and seasonal variations in spring water chemistry can provide insight into source water mixing and ground water residence times feeding a spring as such many attempts have been made to characterize karst springs based on their discharge and physiochemical parameters one of the earlier spring classifications by shuster and white 1971 used temperature and major ion chemistry to classify springs as conduit flow dominant and matrix flow dominant more recent studies have further sought to classify and characterize other elements of flow behavior such as vadose vs phreatic storage using stable water isotopic analysis lakey and krothe 1996 fast flow and slow flow components based on discharge recession curves doctor et al 2005 localized vs distributed recharge based on spring temperature patterns luhmann et al 2011 and conduit flow vs matrix flow components based on mg ca ratios during storm flow toran and reisch 2013 goldscheider 2015 pointed out the need for multiple tracers such as dyes to determine fast flow paths and natural tracers such as stable water isotopes for slow flow paths lack of variation in isotope signals during storm events has been used as evidence of mixing of fast and slow paths not indicated by other tracers winston and criss 2004 schwarz et al 2009 thicker soil cover leading to slower recharge has been used to explain some isotope mixing zhao et al 2018 the lag between discharge response and conductivity response has been used to estimate travel times birk et al 2004 seasonal variation in mixing along flow paths has been demonstrated by discriminant factor analysis of major ions and mg ca ratio in a study by bicalho et al 2012 chloride and specific conductance have been used to evaluate variations in contributions such as activation of deeper flow paths ravbar et al 2011 martin et al 2016 while these approaches allowed for improved conceptual models of karst aquifers critical knowledge gaps still remain regarding recharge and flow paths within a karst system we classify karst flow systems to better understand the complex pathways formed by the fast flow paths in conduits and slow flow paths through the matrix in actuality the matrix comprises both primary and fracture porosity and permeability resulting in a flow system that is a continuum from larger to smaller openings and from conduit to diffuse flow thus the discharge chemistry reflects output from varied recharge fast flow paths slow flow paths and flow paths that result from mixing of conduit and matrix water to move beyond using end members to describe flow paths it is important to evaluate multiple storm events and use multiple tracers to capture these variations 1 2 rare earth elements as natural tracers rare earth elements rees show potential for determining recharge zones and flow paths in karst aquifers rees are a group of elements comprising the lanthanide series lanthanum la cerium ce praseodymium pr neodymium nd promethium pm samarium sm europium eu gadolinium gd terbium tb dysprosium dy holmium ho erbium er thulium tm ytterbium yb and lutetium lu plus scandium sc and yttrium y henderson 1984 the main chemical difference throughout the lanthanide series is the progressive shrinking in ionic radius from 115 pm la to 93 pm lu which imparts distinct behaviors in their fractionation and incorporation into minerals white 2015 due to the similar ionic radii between neighboring rees they tend to maintain similar relative abundances in nature despite significantly variable absolute abundances with the exception of cerium which can have a 2 valence and europium which can have a 4 valence the rees have a 3 valence the variable valence state for cerium and europium allows them to fractionate relative to their neighbors under certain environmental conditions such as redox variations making them useful natural geochemical tracers leybourne and johannesson 2008 ree patterns from host materials can also be transferred to water providing a useful tool for tracing recharge areas and flow paths playà et al 2007 hydrological studies have used rees to better understand flow paths through water rock interactions johannesson et al 1997 tang and johannesson 2006 göb et al 2013 recharge conditions möller et al 2006 tweed et al 2006 willis and johannesson 2011 and transport ingri et al 2000 pourret et al 2010 in an early study johannesson et al 1997 observed the unique ree patterns of carbonate and felsic rocks were imparted in waters recharging through them allowing for groundwater mixing to be assessed between the two sources further along in their flow paths möller et al 2006 also noted the imparting of lithological ree patterns on groundwater in a region with variable basalt basalt limestone limestone and gypsum dominated recharge areas willis and johannesson 2011 observed homogeneous flat shale normalized ree patterns and groundwater compositions throughout an aquifer indicating relatively homogeneous recharge patterns through shale weathered bulk sediments ingri et al 2000 reported on the positive relationship between ree concentrations and sediment weathering with a strong linear correlation being noted between ree concentrations and dissolved aluminum al derived from al rich sediments other authors such as tang and johannesson 2006 measured dissolved ree concentrations throughout a sand aquifer which generally decreased in concentration indicating changes in redox and ph conditions along flow paths tweed et al 2006 explored changing ree patterns along an aquifer s flow paths noting increased ree concentrations when ph conditions were lowest 6 1 typically near the aquifer s recharge area with decreasing ree concentrations as ph increased downgradient studies on the mobility of rees such as by pourret et al 2010 have noted the tendency for rees to be sorbed and strongly mobilized with colloids in addition to variable concentrations göb et al 2013 reported on the presence of negative cerium ce anomalies in oxidized waters due the variable oxidation states of ce controlling its mobility studies exploring ree transport and temporal variability though are still limited ingri et al 2000 pourret et al 2010 gill et al 2018 additionally the relative significance and complexity of the factors controlling ree patterns in hydrologic systems such as redox ph colloidal transport and host rock contribution are still not entirely understood noack et al 2014 duvert et al 2015 the application of rees to better understand flow paths and recharge makes them promising tools in karst aquifers which are inherently complex johannesson et al 2000 observed that shale normalized ree patterns in aquifer water reflected that of the host rock with carbonate rocks exhibiting heavy ree enrichment and negative ce anomalies gill et al 2018 used contrasting ree ratios e g pr yb y ho between limestone and sandstone in a lowland karst network to determine varying recharge contributions from each lithology zhou et al 2012 identified middle rare earth element mree enrichment in stalagmites related to changing recharge conditions through the overlying soil layer toran et al 2018 used rees to identify springs with a greater contribution to discharge from slow flow through the carbonate bedrock matrix subdued ree signatures were observed after rain events in karst springs filippini et al 2018 despite these results more research is needed especially into behaviors unique to karst systems such as temporal variability and recharge heterogeneity for this study the two adjacent springs were analyzed for natural tracers these tracers can provide a more complete understanding of source area recharge and flow behavior feeding the two springs 2 study site two karst springs tippery and near tippery were chosen for storm response monitoring fig 1 these springs have been included in historic and recent research for examining the similarities and differences in their recharge and flow behaviors their separate yet adjacent capture areas provide identical rainfall conditions since the springs are only 65 m apart but allow for comparison of recharge and flow path differences located within the folded and faulted valley and ridge province of central pennsylvania s nittany valley the two springs emerge from the foot of canoe mountain a topographic ridge which merges with brush mountain and bald eagle mountain to the west which form the western boundary of the allegheny front berg et al 1980 canoe mountain forms the axis of a syncline with silurian and ordovician sandstones forming the ridges and ordovician shales and carbonates forming the flank and foot of the ridge respectively minor streams off the ridge typically flow after storms although some streams such as tippery sink are perennial these streams often feed sinkholes in the carbonate rocks which in turn feed nearby springs tippery spring has been traced to three upland sinkholes while near tippery spring has been traced to one sinkhole with no observed cross over between capture areas hull 1980 dye trace travel times were less than 48 h for tippery spring and less than 72 h for near tippery spring both springs show similar baseflow discharges of 0 14 0 28 m3 sec with storm flow discharges up to 0 85 m3 sec shuster and white 1971 the drainage area of each spring is estimated to be around 3 4 km2 extending up to the ridgetop herman et al 2009 hull 1980 the springs are at an elevation of 274 m msl with a capture area extending up to the ridge top of 396 m both springs have variable discharge temperature and chemistry at the seasonal scale shuster and white 1971 and storm response scale herman et al 2009 a study by berglund et al 2018 re examined tippery spring and near tippery spring from the shuster and white 1971 study by comparing stable water isotope chemistry after storm recharge the results revealed recharge behaviors which were dependent on both the size of the storm and the intrinsic recharge characteristics of each spring for a given storm size tippery spring showed a flashier storm hydrograph response than near tippery spring which translated into a relatively greater portion of storm water based on stable water isotopes in contrast near tippery spring had a buffered stable water isotope response showing a lesser overall portion of storm water spread across the hydrograph along with high resolution data these results allowed for a greater understanding of the two springs recharge and flow behaviors 3 methods 3 1 spring monitoring water temperature and pressure were recorded at 15 minute intervals using onset hobo

acid washed bottles collected spring water samples triggered by rising spring water level in response to each storm the 24 samples at each spring were collected over the course of 24 h with a higher initial sampling rate every 30 min then progressively slower frequency to every 2 h to capture more variable initial geochemical signatures isco bottles were recovered within 1 3 days after the storm

of 2 54 cm two days prior to the may 2017 storm event a slight drizzle 1 25 cm fell on the study site as such slightly wet antecedent conditions prevailed at the onset of the sampling event 7 day api 2 94 the water sampling period continued until 16 30 est on may 6 2017 due to the wet antecedent conditions discharges at tippery spring and near tippery spring were slightly elevated above their average annual base flow values 0 03 m3 s and 0 01 m3 s respectively to 0 11 m3 s and 0 09 m3 s respectively in response to the storm tippery spring reached a peak flow of 0 86 m3 s fourteen hours after the start of rainfall and receded to 0 49 m3 s by the end of sampling near tippery spring reached a peak flow of 0 46 m3 s fifteen hours after the start of rainfall with a variable discharge plateau 0 37 0 49 m3 s for the remainder of the sampling period the june 2017 storm fell during two pulses the first beginning on june 15 2017 at 19 00 est and depositing 5 30 cm of rain over 7 h and the second beginning on june 16 2017 at 16 00 est depositing 2 30 cm of rain over 2 h spring water sampling continued until 1 30 est on june 17 little to no rainfall occurred prior to the june 2017 storm 7 day api 0 06 due to the dry antecedent conditions discharges at tippery spring and near tippery spring initially had their annual average base flow values of 0 03 m3 s and 0 01 m3 s respectively in response to the storm tippery spring reached a peak flow of 1 20 m3 s seven hours after the onset of rainfall and recovered to 0 23 m3 s twelve hours later then peaked again at 1 19 m3 s three hours after the beginning of the second period of rainfall and recovered slightly to 0 95 m3 s by the end of the sampling period near tippery spring reached a peak flow of 0 59 m3 s seven hours after the first occurrence of rainfall recovered to 0 39 m3 s ten hours later then peaked again at 0 61 m3 s six hours after the second onset of rainfall near tippery recovered slightly to 0 53 m3 s by the end of the sampling period 4 2 storm chemographs 4 2 1 parameter groupings water level calibrated to discharge at a weir temperature and ph were measured using dataloggers which provided high resolution and easily retrievable indicators of storm water arrival at the springs total suspended solids tss specific conductance sc alkalinity calcite saturation index sic and stable water isotopes δ2h δ18o were analyzed from water samples as they provide information on spring chemistry changes during storm flow such as matrix water dilution carbonate rock dissolution and saturation and parsing of isotopically distinct pre storm water and storm water fractions in addition this study examined the temporal variations in molar mg ca ratios and ca zr ratios and metals such as fe and zr and rees mg ca ratios indicate varying conduit matrix water interactions as matrix water tends to have higher mg ca ratios than conduit water metals were analyzed to further explore their relationship with ree mobility and concentration zr was selected as a potential indicator of upland source waters as zr concentrations in the upland sandstones and shales are found in higher concentrations than in the local carbonate rocks from whole rock analysis 131 ppm and 16 ppm respectively as similarly noted by hua et al 2013 ca zr ratios were explored as an indicator of recharged storm water from the clastic upland ridges which are enriched in zr and depleted in ca relative to the carbonate bedrock both δ2h δ18o fell linearly along the local meteoric water line so only δ2h is shown in chemographs for each spring chemographs were produced from continuous loggers and samples from automatic sampling along with grab samples during post storm baseflow conditions figs 4 7 certain parameters varied together in the chemographs for both springs and there were different patterns for the parameter groups being carbonate springs with high ca concentrations the chemical parameters sc alkalinity and sic tended to vary together with the mg ca ratio showing similar variability but a slightly more complex response stable water isotopes and ca zr ratios also showed similar timing to these chemical parameters in the initial response but differed later in the hydrograph tss metals total rees and the ce anomaly grouped together based on their similar timing suggesting transport with or as sediment for these constituents temperature and ph varied from storm to storm and did not show similar timing to the other variables temperature sometimes showed a storm pulse although long term temperature logger data showed that not all storm events have a temperature signal toran et al 2018 little change in temperature was observed during the may storm at either spring due to the relatively small size of the storm and lack of temperature contrast between the storm water and ambient ground water in contrast the june storm resulted in a notable temperature change at both springs due to a greater amount of rainfall and a greater temperature contrast between storm water and ambient ground water producing a temperature spike for each storm pulse at tippery spring and a gradual increase at near tippery spring 4 2 2 pre storm conditions pre storm conditions varied for both springs before the two storms may pre storm concentrations were likely a consequence of the wet antecedent conditions prior to the may storm fig 4 for tippery and fig 6 for near tippery this included elevated tss and dissolved metals fe zr slightly enriched stable isotope values decreased sc alkalinity ca zr ratio and calcite si the pre storm water chemistry prior to the june storm was more typical of baseflow samples for both springs during this study and from previous historical sampling shuster and white 1971 in addition the initial mg ca ratio differed between the two springs for both storms tippery spring s pre storm water chemistry parameters showed low mg ca ratios reflecting the predominantly limestone flow path area while near tippery spring had a higher overall mg ca ratio due to the relatively greater fraction of dolomite within its flow path fig 1 4 2 3 tippery spring chemographs at tippery spring during both storms a brief approximately 1 hour spike in ph sc alkalinity and sic signaled the initial arrival of storm water this increase was likely flushing of older more concentrated water stored in the system figs 4 and 5 this spike occurred just before the stable isotope signal of storm water indicated by rising δ2h partway through the rising limb of the discharge hydrograph the mg ca ratio also spiked although slightly delayed from the other initial responses as the storm water isotope signal arrived sc and alkalinity became diluted followed by a gradual recovery for the may storm fig 4 for the june storm the same initial dilution from arriving storm water was observed but the larger storm resulted in a slightly longer dilution period and more gradual recovery that was interrupted by a second storm event fig 5 the mg ca ratio followed these trends with slight differences during the may storm the dilution period for mg ca was slightly longer than for sc and other dissolved constituents and the recovery was slower as well the timing of the mg ca ratio also differed from other dissolved constituents in the june storm there was a larger initial increase possibly piston flow component of older water and a delay in the dilution phase the second storm water pulse during the june storm produced a second increase in mg ca the ca zr ratio and the stable water isotope signature followed inverse trends ca zr decreased along with other chemical parameters as the δ2h increased however these two parameters showed a slower recovery compared to the other dissolved constituents the arrival of the storm pulse at tippery spring was accompanied by an increase in tss trace metals shown by fe and zr and total rees this increase began at the same time as the isotope storm water increase but peaked slightly later then showed an asymmetrical long tail decline that lingered longer than other dissolved constituents the ce anomaly followed a similar pattern but returned to pre storm baseflow values sooner than the total rees and metals figs 4 and 5 4 2 4 near tippery spring chemographs near tippery showed a similar grouping of dissolved constituent response and sediment parameter response but with slightly different timing figs 6 and 7 the initial storm signal arrived later in the discharge hydrograph after the peak for both the may and the june storms there was no initial spike as observed at tippery in several parameters however for the june storm a signal from additional overland flow was observed initially this overland flow was triggered by the larger june storm and was indicated by a rapid storm signal increase in storm water stable isotopes temperature and sediment along with dilution of dissolved constituents the overland flow mixing with spring flow has been observed for large storms during site visits the separate arrival of groundwater storm discharge at near tippery spring was indicated by a decrease in the dissolved constituents sc alkalinity sic ca zr ratio and mg ca ratio and an increase in the stable water isotope signature during the may storm dilution in the dissolved constituents was followed by a rebound to concentrations above the baseflow conditions except for ca zr then a gradual decline back to baseflow levels on the falling limb of the hydrograph during the june storm recovery did not rebound to concentrations above the baseflow conditions the timing of the changes in mg ca ratio for the may storm was similar to the other parameters however for the june storm the mg ca ratio responded faster relative to the other parameters and a rise in mg ca was seen for the second storm pulse in june the ca zr ratio and the isotope signature both showed a slower recovery to baseflow values than other chemical parameters for both storms the sediment associated parameters tss fe zr and rees showed the same pattern at tippery spring and near tippery spring with an increase on the rising limb and an asymmetrical decrease on the falling limb 4 2 5 comparison of storm responses the timing and degree of response varied based on the size of the storm event the larger june storm vs the weaker may storm and the intrinsic nature of recharge of each spring s capture area tippery spring having a larger storm water recharge volume compared to near tippery spring as indicated by stable isotopes berglund et al 2018 the dilution and recovery was more gradual at near tippery spring than at tippery spring and more gradual for the larger june storm compared to the smaller may storm the tss metal and ree concentrations also increase later at near tippery spring than at tippery spring and recovered more gradually than the chemical parameters at both springs 4 3 spring ree spidergrams during storm response with the exception of europium all individual ree concentrations were above detection limits albeit at low concentrations paas normalized plots of individual ree concentrations for a single water sample called spidergrams illustrated internal ree trends and anomalies resulting from geochemical processes and water rock interactions in the may storm where pre and post storm samples were available for clear comparison with baseflow water chemistry figs 8 and 9 only the may storm was selected here due to the availability of pre and post storm samples to make inferences about lingering effects of storms on ree characteristics baseflow sampling of select carbonate springs in pennsylvania including tippery spring and near tippery spring for cerium anomalies suggested that springs with a greater component of slow matrix flow contain more prominent negative cerium anomalies ce 1 toran et al 2018 this relationship was further explored here where relative contributions of faster conduit flow and slower matrix flow varied in response to storm recharge for tippery spring fig 8 ree patterns during pre storm flow had low ree concentrations with a slightly negative cerium anomaly there was also a non detect of europium time a the apparent europium anomaly during baseflow conditions is the result of being near or below detection limit instead of association with the carbonate bedrock and its behavior is not considered further here at peak ree concentrations time b there were no cerium anomalies as ree concentrations began to drop to pre storm levels time c the slightly negative cerium anomaly returned at the time where other spring chemistry parameters recovered time d ree concentrations were still slightly elevated above their pre storm values despite other indicators of slow matrix flow contributions flow contribution a strong cerium anomaly was not seen at tippery spring during any period of storm response this further highlights tippery spring s greater conduit flow influence even during baseflow but also suggests that a cerium anomaly may be a sensitive indicator of conduit flow mixing with slow matrix flow during storm recovery for near tippery spring fig 9 ree patterns during pre storm flow time a were similar to tippery spring having low overall ree concentrations and non detect of europium but differed by having a notably negative cerium anomaly this cerium anomaly discrepancy between the two springs was also observed in the baseflow sampling toran et al 2018 during peak ree concentrations in response to storm flow time b the cerium anomaly was eliminated a slight return of the cerium anomaly was observed during the ree concentration recovery time c ree concentrations remained slightly elevated with the return of the cerium anomaly time d after other chemical parameters have recovered the presence of the negative cerium anomaly during baseflow suggests carbonate bedrock interaction and its subsequent anomaly neutralization during storm flow suggests faster flow paths storm water rees had similar ree patterns to the paas shale standard with no enrichment in light middle or heavy rees lree mree hree but instead showed a relatively flat pattern the lack of anomalies and similar ree pattern to the paas shale standard further support that stormflow ree enrichment is sourced in the detrital clastics upgradient feeding into the carbonate sinkholes rather than in the carbonate rocks themselves 5 discussion the two springs shared a similar cycle of storm response characterized by three distinct periods fig 10 the three periods are similar for each storm but nonetheless there are distinctions between the two springs there were differences in arrival times of storm pulses for the two springs and longer recovery times for the larger storm the differences between these three periods provide evidence for mixing along their recharge and flow paths period 1 piston flow spring discharge rises shortly after rainfall due to a piston flow effect from increased pressure head in the recharge area no geochemical variation in spring mouth chemistry occurred at near tippery spring during this period while a short spike in chemical parameters occurred at tippery spring indicating purging of older more concentrated pre storm water which has been observed in other karst springs birk et al 2004 ravbar et al 2011 ryan and meiman 1996 the purging of older water and faster flow response at tippery spring are indicative of faster flow paths in contrast near tippery s discharge showed mixing between source waters derived from both fast and slow flow responses period 2 arrival of storm water from a combination of faster and slower flow dominated recharge this period begins with the arrival of fast flow storm water through conduits connected to surface runoff from the ridge tops this storm water pulse was indicated by signatures such as an enrichment in stable water isotope values and dilution of chemical parameters including ca zr the dilute storm water was then replaced by water from slower flow paths signaled by an increase in sc alkalinity sic and mg ca ratio mixing of waters from fast and slow flow paths was observed however based on different patterns in the timing of chemical parameters in previous studies mixing induced by storms has been observed by cl fluctuation in the chemograph mitrofan et al 2015 by age dating martin et al 2016 by isotope tracers schwarz et al 2009 and by variation in temperature and sc particularly at low flow periods filippini et al 2018 the timing of period 2 differs between tippery spring and near tippery spring tippery spring showed storm water on the rising limb of the hydrograph for near tippery spring period 2 begins 4 6 h after the peak flow plateau is reached with storm water gradually rising to a maximum about 12 h after peak flow this slower response is likely due to near tippery spring s decreased conduit flow portion in discharge creating a flow buffering capacity the slightly different timing in mg ca ratios at both springs compared to the other chemical parameters suggested that mixing can be complex as mg ca increases more contact with the matrix is inferred while faster flow paths are inferred from mg ca decreases there were both increases and decreases in the mg ca ratio observed in period 2 we detailed the mg ca ratio because it is an important example of mixing as conduits vary from larger to smaller openings varying degrees of interaction occur with the matrix furthermore different recharge events can capture from varying areas also creating variable mixtures thus at near tippery spring during the may storm the mg ca ratio declined at a similar time as sc and other dissolved constituents but showed an earlier decline than sc in the june storm at tippery spring mg ca ratios took longer to recover than sc and other chemical parameters for the may storm for the june storm mg ca increased while sc decreased indicating a stronger matrix component possibly indicating a piston flow pulse of older water this piston flow component may explain the delayed dilute storm water signature in mg ca ratios thus period 2 showed both increases and decreases in mg ca ratios at tippery spring which provided evidence of mixing of fast and slow flow paths all parameters showed a more extended storm signal and recovery for the larger june storm as expected the june storm resulted in about two times more discharge than the may storm at tippery spring and nearly three times more discharge at near tippery spring the dilution factors and recovery periods differed more between the may and june storms at near tippery even though the flow is the more buffered at this spring the contrast in discharge between the two storms and larger dilution reflects the slower travel times to near tippery spring mg ca ratios varied more than sc and other dissolved constituents thus each spring has storm to storm differences in response indicating that flow paths include varied portions of conduit and slow components depending on the storm a more buffered spring may require longer sampling periods to capture chemograph variations and faster flow paths require finer time intervals recharge source area parameters also appear during this period such as an increase in tss which signaled flushing of surface sediments and the decrease in ca zr ratios which indicated the arrival of waters interacting with zr rich and ca poor ridgetop sediments feeding sinks and sinkholes parameters associated with sediments such as rees and metals also increased during this period this study pointed out that ion ratios can better indicate chemical variations that tag source areas ca zr and matrix components mg ca period 3 recovery to new base flow fed by slower matrix dominated flow paths the third period was marked by a decline in tss and metals for the may storm there was more tss variation in the june storm and recovery was interrupted by a second storm so a distinct period 3 was not observed at either spring the length of time for recovery was difficult to estimate with the gap between automated sampler measurements and the second storm event in june although for a given rainfall event tippery spring showed a shorter recovery time than near tippery spring for both storms the ree concentrations retained a storm pulse signal i e slightly elevated concentration longer than tss and chemical parameters in the recovery period spring discharge also remained elevated as the water chemistry returned to concentrations similar to pre storm periods high mg ca sic closer to saturation in addition to the high discharge the stable water isotopes and ca zr ratio were slow to recover to pre storm conditions the long tail of recovery for these components provides further evidence of mixing of flow paths and storm water input that extends further than indicated by the dilution and recovery of dissolved constituents such as sc in summary although these periods in the hydrographs and chemographs of karst springs have been identified in previous studies e g ford and williams 2007 ravbar et al 2011 the analysis here pointed out additional complexity in the arrival of storm water in period 2 by examining multiple tracers these mixing patterns were identified as well as storm to storm variations the importance of continuous monitoring including the tail of the hydrograph was also reinforced by the monitoring at these adjacent springs variations in age and mixing in springs that are in close proximity have been identified previously particularly at low flow martin et al 2016 filippini et al 2018 but the distances were on the order of kilometers in this study the springs were only 65 m apart and still showed distinct responses in the storm chemographs 5 1 ca zr ratios as indicators of storm recharge source area one relationship which stood out during storm water arrival was the ratio between ca and zr in relation to stable water isotope storm water fraction comparing ca zr ratios to storm water fraction determined from stable water isotopes berglund et al 2018 showed a mixing relationship between pre storm water with a high ca zr ratio and a storm water component with low ca zr fig 11 prior to the influence of storm recharge base flow matrix water contained elevated ca relative to zr as the carbonate bedrock contains little detrital zr contributing to stored water during storm flow a drop in ca zr ratio corresponded to the arrival of storm water as indicated from the stable water isotopes this ratio decrease during the arrival of storm water was due to the concurrent decrease of ca concentration and increase in zr concentration the decrease in ca concentration was due to the flushing and dilution of high ca matrix water by recharging storm water which contains little to no ca in contrast zr concentrations increased with increasing storm water component this increased zr concentration likely resulted from storm water having interacted with surficial clastic sediments with elevated concentrations of zr relative to the carbonates these clastic sediments are transported after storms by the sinking streams draining the clastic ridge tops which feed into sinkholes within the carbonate rock at the foot of the hills as a result ca zr ratios provided both a useful indicator of storm water arrival along with source of recharge water as the analyzed water samples included materials below 0 45 μm ca and zr are transported in both dissolved and colloidal phases 5 2 rare earth element ree concentrations during storm flow during period 1 and period 3 total ree concentrations in both springs were lowest 0 10 0 15 ppb during period 2 with the arrival of storm water total ree concentrations increase at both springs up to 1 30 ppb total ree concentrations in spring water showed a strong positive correlation with zr and fe concentrations fig 12 increased total ree concentrations also appear to be influenced by the intensity of recharge and surface connectivity with a relatively greater ree increase during the larger june storm than the may storm and a relatively greater ree increase for tippery spring than near tippery spring during pre storm and matrix flow conditions total ree concentrations were consistently low indicating minor contribution from carbonate matrix dissolution furthermore there was a weaker cerium anomaly at tippery spring which further highlights tippery spring s greater conduit flow influence but also suggests that a cerium anomaly may be a sensitive indicator of conduit flow mixing with slower matrix flow during storm recovery total ree increased with zr indicating rees are introduced into the aquifer during storm flow sourced from the same areas as the zr bearing sediments namely the high zr low ca clastic ridge tops feeding into the sinkholes total ree concentrations correlated well with the relative fraction of matrix water and storm water with increased total rees occurring with a greater storm water fraction fig 13 the lowest ree concentrations 0 15 ppb occurred in spring water with the greatest pre storm water fraction signature pre storm baseflow samples with the arrival of storm water after rain events ree concentrations increased with increasing storm water component to the springs with the greatest ree concentrations 0 8 ppb occurring near maximum storm water fraction although these relationships generally held true for both springs when the pre storm water or storm water fractions dominated the transition from low to high ree concentrations as the slower matrix flow mixedwith the faster conduit flow storm water was not smooth between storm water fractions of 0 3 0 7 total ree concentrations were highly variable between the maximum and minimum concentrations seen during high matrix water fraction and high storm water fraction respectively this imperfect transition is likely due to irregular ree mobility from changing ph and redox conditions from mixing water sources after a storm but could also be the result of recharge source area heterogeneities affecting ree mobility in different source areas 6 conclusions 6 1 storm response characteristics of tippery and near tippery springs first analyzed for flow characterization by shuster and white 1971 tippery spring and near tippery spring were classified as conduit flow dominated springs based on their seasonally variable water temperature and chemistry while being classified as conduit flow it was also noted that the springs exhibited distinct behaviors despite their close proximity using high resolution logging and water sampling in response to storms these springs were re examined to better define the varying degrees of faster conduit flow and slower flow along with multiple recharge modes for the two springs of the two springs tippery spring exhibited more dominant fast flow conduit behavior through rapid storm response and recovery of discharge and chemistry while near tippery spring exhibited a relatively delayed storm response buffered geochemistry and drawn out recovery these comparative differences between the two springs were maintained during the smaller may 2017 storm and the larger june 2017 storm indicating behaviors intrinsic to the natural recharge and flow characteristic of each spring s recharge area rather than storm intensity or antecedent conditions despite the inherent differences both springs did experience a similar sequence of storm response characteristics marked by the following periods period 1 storm piston pulse period 2 storm water arrival including varying degrees of faster conduit dominant flow and slower matrix dominant flow and period 3 post storm recovery the relative timing and duration of these three flow periods were a function of the intrinsic nature of recharge and flow for each spring along with storm intensity a larger storm produced a greater period 2 duration and a stronger surface connection such as tippery spring had a relatively shorter period 1 duration and greater period 2 conduit flow phase the nature of these periods unique to each spring has important hydrological implications such as water sampling intervals and contaminant storage and transport a spring with near tippery s characteristics with a longer recovery should be sampled longer while tippery spring needs a finer interval to capture different pulses of storm water furthermore constituents associated with sediment transport showed a longer recovery and should be sampled for a longer time to better understand their transport behavior 6 2 new tracers for recharge and flow paths two natural tracers were applied in new ways for this study ca zr ratios and ree patterns both tracers provided additional information about flow paths and recharge sources as they varied during the storm hydrograph stable water isotopes directly indicated the arrival of storm water to the springs while ca zr ratios provided insight into recharge area source and timing these patterns and results may be shared among other karst systems with allogenic recharge from siliciclastic areas while karst systems with autogenic recharge may show muted response in these tracers due to greater flow path lengths and more buffered storm recharge behavior during pre storm baseflow high ca zr ratios reflected water which has dominantly interacted with the carbonate host rock with the arrival of storm water ca zr ratios dropped as the previously elevated ca concentrations from storage became diluted by storm water while zr concentrations increased from the influx of storm water which had interacted with clastic surface sediments as a storm water arrival indicator in clastic ridge fed valley and ridge springs this relationship made ca zr ratios a useful substitute for stable water isotopes while also providing information on source area an advantage of the ca zr signature is that zr analysis is typically provided with other trace elements whereas stable water isotopes typically require extensive sampling to develop a local meteoric water line and additional analytical techniques ree concentrations were lowest 0 15 ppb at both springs during baseflow conditions in response to storm water recharge ree concentrations increased with the arrival of storm water ree spidergrams varied throughout different periods of storm response for these springs ree patterns during periods of little storm water influence periods 1 and 3 exhibited negative cerium anomalies which were weak tippery spring to moderate near tippery spring this behavior coincided with the conceptual model of tippery spring being inherently more conduit flow dominated while near tippery spring is inherently more affected by slower flow during periods of surficial sediment recharge period 2 the ree patterns exhibited neutral ce 1 cerium anomalies suggesting the storm recharged sediment was derived from the clastic rocks along the ridges rather than the local carbonate bedrock elevated ree concentrations persisting after other parameters recovered to pre storm levels suggested slower flow paths recharging the two springs which was less apparent with the other parameters these results illustrate the sensitivity of ree concentrations and anomalies in karst springs to storm events recharge areas and flow paths even as other storm flow indicators e g stable water isotopes tss mg ca ratios may have subsided elevated ree concentrations and altered cerium anomalies may linger for an extended period of time as such the presence of low ree concentrations along with a pronounced cerium anomaly may be a good indicator of matrix affected recharge and storm flow recovery to a spring elevated ree concentrations after a storm along with neutralized cerium anomaly differentiate between water which has interacted with either the local carbonate matrix or the upland siliciclastics this study illustrated the relationships among multiple tracers to understand source waters in different periods of storm hydrographs ree concentrations along with other parameters such as stable water isotopes mg ca and ca zr ratios provided a more complete understanding of karst flow and recharge paths and showed how contrasts between adjacent springs differentiates recharge pathways conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to

6653,multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs generally need to adjust operational functions for different storage levels most existing reservoir schemes lack the pertinence to model the complex

infiltration capacity vic parametric functions generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue xinfengjiang reservoir 1 introduction the demand for water has been steadily increasing globally along with the expanding population ashoori et al 2017 chen et al 2016 he et al 2018 however freshwater resources are finite and unevenly distributed icold 1998 undp 2006 since the second half of the 20th century reservoirs dams have been continuously constructed to control streamflow and to store water for the purposes of meeting increasing water demands and reducing risks from water related disasters icold 2007 zhou et al 2016 shi et al 2018 more than 45 000 large dams reservoirs with a volume of 8300 km3 have now been built globally chao et al 2008 icold 2007 lehner et al 2011 reservoirs can serve one or more purposes including flood control water supply hydropower generation navigation and recreation icold 2007 in addition reservoirs can be classified into single year and multiyear reservoirs according to the characteristics of reservoir storage and inflow single year reservoirs regulate river discharges at daily monthly seasonal or yearly temporal scales while multiyear reservoirs regulate interannual river discharges skaar and sorgard 2006 given the numerous and complex functions of reservoirs reservoir operations including the release of water to generate hydropower and to supply water downstream and the storage of water during floods can significantly affect river discharges thus questions about reservoir storage and outflow variations and their impacts upon terrestrial hydrological processes have been raised to explore the features of terrestrial hydrological processes and water resource security macroscale hydrological models such as the variable infiltration capacity model vic liang et al 1994 1996 soil and water assessment tools swat arnold et al 1998 the versatile integrator of surface and atmosphere processes visa yang and niu 2003 and the digital yellow river integrated model dyrim wang et al 2007 2015 are usually applied to simulate hydrological processes nevertheless these models do not include numerical schemes for simulating reservoir operations hanasaki et al 2006 because the influence of reservoir operations to terrestrial hydrological processes needs to be quantified numerous attempts have been made to integrate reservoir schemes with these models meigh et al 1999 haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2006 neitsch et al 2002 yates et al 2005a 2005b these schemes have considered decision rules and features of reservoirs to provide the responses of reservoir systems for certain conditions however the schemes mentioned above usually consider one or two functions only thus they cannot reflect the complexity of multipurpose reservoirs for example hanasaki et al 2006 categorized reservoirs into irrigation and nonirrigation purposes and used the inflow dependency approach to simulate reservoir outflows which determined them mainly by irrigation demand moreover the time step of these reservoir schemes are mostly one month since multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs operate over a multiyear temporal scale with multiple purposes the schemes in the studies of meigh et al 1999 haddeland et al 2006 and hanasaki et al 2006 might not be suitable for simulating their outflows and storages to enrich the simulation capabilities of large scale hydrological models wu and chen 2012 developed an operation based scheme to simulate daily outflows of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs the new scheme adopted decision based parameters and purpose based outflow variations to simulate the outflow and storage of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs it can also consider the complexity of such reservoirs however wu and chen 2012 also indicated this reservoir scheme required much input information such as the observed historical discharge and storage to calibrate decision based parameters therefore it might be difficult to apply to reservoirs with limited reservoir management data moreover they indicated time varying decision based parameters might provide better simulation in this study therefore a new scheme is developed based on the operation based reservoir scheme mentioned above it differs by providing functional relationships to estimate decision based parameters depending on the reservoir water level to evaluate the performances of reservoir schemes this study adopts as the platform a widely used macroscale hydrologic model vic liang et al 1994 1996 the vic model has already been coupled with a reservoir scheme in the study of hanasaki et al 2006 which presented an algorithm that could reduce the root mean square error of a reservoir release and river discharge simulation however as mentioned before the reservoir scheme developed by hanasaki et al 2006 mainly considered irrigation demand and lacks the capacity to model the complex behaviors of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs thus a more robust reservoir scheme is needed in summary this study has two objectives one is to further improve the operation based reservoir scheme proposed by wu and chen 2012 with functional decision based parameters the other is to suggest a reasonable reservoir scheme for the vic model to simulate reservoir storage and outflow at the interannual scale in regions with limited reservoir management data the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data used in this study the details of the improved operation based reservoir scheme and other methodologies used in this study are illustrated in section 3 scheme comparisons are included in section 4 followed by discussion and conclusions in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study area and data 2 1 study area xinfengjiang reservoir xfjr is a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir located in heyuan guangdong province china fig 1 it is the largest man made lake in guangdong province with an area of 370 km2 and a storage capacity of 13 9 km3 it is impounded by xinfengjiang dam built in 1962 with a height of 124 m the main functions of the xfjr are hydropower generation flood control irrigation water supply and navigation the reservoir area is dominated by the subtropical monsoon climate and the rainy season is from april to september the operational purposes of the xfjr are related to its corresponding reservoir operation water levels and four important water levels are considered in this study similar to those used in wu and chen 2012 the dead storage level ld critical water level lc flood control water level lp and emergency water level le all those water levels are associated with corresponding water storages vd vc vp and ve respectively for the xfjr the designed emergency storage ve and the dead storage vd are 12 9 km3 and 4 3 km3 respectively the flood control storage vp and the critical storage vc vary with time all of this basic information is plotted in fig 2 2 2 data and objective functions in this study observed daily outflows and storages from the xfjr from 1st january 1965 to 31st december 1984 are used to calibrate the decision based parameters of the operation based reservoir scheme and to compare the performances of reservoir schemes observed daily outflows and storages from 1st january 1987 to 31st december 1988 are used to validate the reservoir schemes to evaluate the performances of reservoir schemes several objective functions are employed including relative bias rb relative root mean square error rrmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse among them rb is used to measure the magnitude of the bias for the variable x and a small absolute value of rb indicates a good performance rrmse provides a measure to estimate the error for the whole simulation process the nse is a normalized statistic to determine the relative magnitude of the residual variance versus the observed data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 which indicates the simulation performance by comparing the plot of the observed and simulated data the nse ranges from to 1 and 1 corresponds to a perfect match of the simulated data to the observed data the equations for computing rb rrmse and the nse are given as follows 1 rb t 1 n x s i m t x o b s t t 1 n x o b s t 2 rrmse t 1 n x o b s t x s i m t 2 n x obs 3 nse 1 t 1 n x s i m t x o b s t 2 t 1 n x o b s t x obs 2 where x s i m t is the simulated value on day t x o b s t is the observed data on the same day and x obs is the long term average value for the observed data 2 3 reservoir inflow this study used the vic model as the platform for reservoir schemes to run the vic model this study adopts daily meteorological data feng et al 2004 including precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures and wind speed soil and vegetation data over the east river basin are extracted from two datasets found in the study of nijssen et al 2001 the global soil dataset and the global vegetation dataset calibrated parameters for the routing process obtained by niu and chen 2010 are used to route the simulated streamflow in this study the temporal resolution is 1 day and the spatial resolution is 1 degree based on the simulated natural streamflow over the xinfengjiang river basin net inflow ii of the xfjr is suggested as follows 4 i i i n i p c p i e v p i d s d t i where ini is the stream inflow into the reservoir simulated by the vic model on day i pcpi is the precipitation over the reservoir evpi is the evaporation over the reservoir and d s d t i is the variation in soil moisture all terms are in the unit of km3 day 1 once the initial storage value is given daily water storages for a period e g 1st january 1965 to 31st december 1984 or 1st january 1987 to 31st december 1988 can be calculated by using one of the three reservoir schemes this study adopts initial storages of 6 28 km3 and 3 40 km3 for the calibration and validation periods respectively these values are the observed xfjr reservoir storages at the beginning of 1965 and the beginning of 1987 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 new operation based reservoir scheme according to the basic features of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs wu and chen 2012 developed an advanced version of the target release approach the operation based reservoir scheme at a daily time step their scheme considers four reservoir operational purposes flood control hydropower generation water supply and impoundment the current reservoir storage level determines the priority of operational purposes when the reservoir storage level is above le lp which indicates the occurrence of extremely large floods the outflow equals the maximum allowable release of the reservoir when the reservoir storage level exceeds lp le reservoir operations follow flood control the target release approach is adopted to simulate the reservoir release when the storage water level is between lp and ld reservoir operations follow hydropower generation water supply and impoundment when the storage water level is below ld the release is zero the reservoir storage level may exceed lp during floods the target release approach was adopted to simulate the reservoir release in such cases neitsch et al 2002 for the target release approach the reservoir outflow qi m3 day 1 on day i is calculated as follows 5 q i v i v p n d targ where v i m3 is the current volume of water stored in the reservoir on day i v p m3 is the target reservoir storage on day i and ndtarg is the number of days necessary for the reservoir to reach vp the reservoir storage level varies between ld and lp in most cases wu and chen 2012 introduced two important hypotheses for calculating the outflow and storage variations to meet the tradeoff among three operational purposes one is that the outflow on day i qi m3 day 1 consists of two parts the long term average outflow q i m3 day 1 and the variation on day δ q i m3 day 1 thus the outflow could be represented as follows 6 q i q i δ q i the other hypothesis is that the variation of the outflow at a daily time step δ q i consists of three parts δ q p o w i δ q s u p i and δ q r e s i which are the purpose based outflow variations related to hydropower generation downstream water supply and water impoundment respectively wu and chen 2012 the corresponding weights could be determined by three related decision based parameters α β and γ the outflow variation could be calculated as follows 7 δ q i α δ q p o w i β δ q s u p i γ δ q r e s i a simplified method for computing these three purpose based outflow variations was produced by wu and chen 2012 to reduce the complexity of this scheme the computation process assumed these three purpose based outflow variations are proportional to the long term average outflow qi on day i and the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the daily outflows of each calendar month k mon was introduced

simulation accounting for reservoir operations a parameterization scheme was proposed for natural lakes but was also applied to reservoirs due to the lack of information about reservoirs they modified the model of meigh et al 1999 and parameterized reservoir release as follows 12 q i k r s s min s s min s max s min 1 5 where kr is a release coefficient 0 01 86400 s 1 s is the current storage smax is the maximum reservoir storage and smin is the minimum reservoir storage based on the assumptions produced by döll et al 2003 varying decision based parameters determined by the current storage on a

improve the applicability of the improved operation based reservoir scheme both fa and fb are defined to be 1 5 as in the equations mentioned by meigh et al 1999 the schematic of the improved operation based reservoir scheme is shown in fig 3 3 2 compared reservoir schemes to evaluate the performance of the new reservoir scheme developed in this study see section 3 1 two other reservoir schemes are used for comparison one is the multilinear regression scheme young 1967 bhaskar and whitlatch 1980 and the other is the operation based reservoir scheme developed by wu and chen 2012 1 multilinear regression scheme linear regression was first proposed by young 1967 to find the optimal release based on reservoir inflows and storages bhaskar and whitlatch 1980 suggested a simple multilinear regression procedure to express the optimal release related to the initial storage and inflow this method was extended by karamouz and houck 1982 in a model called dpr this study applies the multilinear regression scheme used by wu and chen 2012 the equation could be represented as follows 16 δ v i a 1 a 2 v i 1 a 3 i i where δvi is the daily change of the reservoir storage on day i m3 day 1 ii is the net inflow m3 day 1 v i 1 is the reservoir storage on the day i 1 m3 day 1 a1 is the constant term m3 day 1 and a2 day 1 and a3 dimensionless are the coefficients of the multiple linear regression equation the three coefficients a1 a2 and a3 need to be calibrated for the multilinear regression scheme in this study these coefficients are calibrated for each calendar month based on the given initial storage and the net inflow calculated by the vic model at a daily time step from 1965 to 1984 once the daily variation has been decided daily outflows q i i i δ v i and storages v i v i 1 δ v i can be computed the calibrated results of the multilinear regression scheme are listed in table 1 2 operation based reservoir scheme this study adopts the operation based reservoir scheme developed by wu and chen 2012 as the other compared reservoir scheme to simulate daily changes in reservoir outflows and storages as mentioned in section 3 1 the three coefficients α β and γ in eq 7 should be calibrated two parameters α and β are calibrated by using vic simulated inflows and historical xjfr daily storages and outflows from 1965 to 1984 the shuffled complex evolution the university of arizona sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 was adopted to optimize the parameters in this study the nse for reservoir outflow is used as the objective function to identify the values of the model parameters when the objective function is closer to 1 0 the nse for reservoir outflow is closer to 1 0 model performance is better the calibrated values of α and β are 0 65 and 0 28 respectively then the value of parameter γ for weighing water impoundment is 0 07 1 0 65 0 28 with these calibrated parameters xfjr storages and outflows from 1965 to 1984 are simulated 3 3 parameter uncertainty uncertainty analysis is of great concern in the field of hydrology amponsah et al 2016 kuria and vogel 2015 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 to further understand the new operation based reservoir scheme proposed in this study the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 is used to analyze the uncertainty of parameters fa and fb see section 3 1 the glue technique identifies acceptable model parameter combinations within the user defined acceptability threshold to estimate prediction uncertainties the glue method has been widely applied in uncertainty assessments for hydrological models since it was developed in 1992 beven and binley 1992 2014 freer et al 1996 jin et al 2010 lamb et al 1998 muleta and nicklow 2005 mcmichael et al 2006 the glue method includes several steps 1 select parameter sets by monte carlo random sampling method 2 define the likelihood function and the threshold value for selected parameter sets 3 calculate the likelihood values of behavioral parameter sets 4 reassign the likelihood values to obtain a cumulative distribution 5 determine the upper and lower bounds of the forecast results and predict the uncertainty in this study the nse was selected as the likelihood function monthly observed storages and reservoir releases of the xfjr for 1965 1984 are used as the observations for the glue procedure the initial ranges for fa and fb both vary from 0 to 3 the uniformly distributed random parameter sets for fa and fb are obtained by random sampling ten thousand parameter sets are used for the uncertainty analysis to guarantee sufficiency and stability based on the likelihood measure the selected cutoff values are 0 5 and 0 15 for storage and outflow simulations respectively the objectives of carrying two uncertainty analyses one for storage and another for outflow are 1 to provide the match situation of simulated outflows and storages respectively and 2 to recognize the capacity of the model for simulating storages and outflows separately by contrast using the weighted average of the nse for storages and outflows might provide information about the compromised results 4 results 4 1 scheme comparison storages and outflows of the xfjr for 1965 1984 were simulated with the three reservoir schemes scheme 1 or the multilinear regression scheme scheme 2 or the operation based scheme and scheme 3 or the new operation based scheme table 2 gives the statistical results of reservoir outflow and storage simulations in the xfjr for 1965 1984 at daily weekly and monthly scales the temporal resolution of all reservoir storage and outflow simulations by using these three reservoir schemes was 1 day weekly and monthly simulations were obtained by aggregating the daily simulations from table 2 it is observed that the simulated reservoir storages at a monthly time step from scheme 3 are better than those from schemes 1 and 2 based on the nse values for example compared with schemes 1 and 2 the nse values for scheme 3 are improved by 76 4 0 60 0 34 0 6 100 and 16 7 0 60 0 54 0 6 100 respectively for the outflow simulation scheme 3 performs better than scheme 1 but worse than scheme 2 according to the nse values this result might be because scheme 2 performs based on the numerical calibration which makes the optimal reservoir releases easier to find to further compare the results fig 4 shows monthly reservoir storage and outflow simulation results from the three reservoir schemes versus observations over the xfjr for 1965 1984 from fig 4 it can be seen that scheme 1 shows the least variation for both reservoir storage and outflow simulations which cannot reflect their complicated variability for scheme 2 simulated storages match the observations well for 1965 1974 but tend to underestimate reservoir storages after 1975 especially for 1980 1982 this result is because the high proportion of hydropower generation minimizes the variety of operational conditions of the xfjr the simulation results from scheme 3 are in closer agreement with the observations for 1980 1984 than those from scheme 2 the bottom panel of fig 4 shows the observed and simulated outflow at monthly scales none of the simulation results from the schemes match the observations well especially for 1970 1980 however the outflow simulation from scheme 3 is closer to the observations after the 1980s than those from schemes 1 and 2 4 2 parameter uncertainty to obtain a visual impression of the posterior distribution of parameters histograms of parameter samples are plotted in fig 5 for storage both distributions fa and fb deviate from normality the higher probability is assigned near the lower bound for fa and near the upper bound for fb the flat and broad posterior distribution of parameters indicates a high uncertainty in parameters the statistical values in table 3 also indicate this situation the posterior distributions of the parameters have a large range and almost cover the prior distribution range the 95 confidence intervals of the parameters are also given in table 3 for outflows distributions for fa and fb show similar features as the posterior distributions of storage which deviate from normality and are distributed flatly and broadly the higher probabilities for both fa and fb are assigned near the upper bound correlations between the parameters estimated from the glue samples are also shown in table 3 fig 6 shows the median values and 95 confidence intervals of monthly simulated storages based on the posterior parameter distributions by the glue method over the xfjr for 1965 1984 the goodness of the model performance for the reservoir storage simulation can be identified by comparing the observations against the median values from the upper panel of fig 6 a it is observed that the median values of the simulated storage match the observations well the nse for the median values of the simulated storages 0 62 indicates a proper model performance for the reservoir storage simulation meanwhile the 95 confidence interval of the simulated monthly storages is given in fig 6 a more than 90 of the observed values are within the 95 confidence interval which indicates scheme 3 can give robust estimations of the monthly storages for the xfjr in addition a comparison of the observed outflows and the simulated median values is plotted in fig 6 b the nse for the median values of the simulated monthly outflows is 0 19 which shows a better performance than scheme 3 with defined empirical coefficients nse 0 16 moreover the 95 confidence intervals of the simulated monthly outflows are much narrower than those for the simulated monthly storages which indicates that the uncertainty of the streamflow simulation due to the model parameters error is less important than that of the storage simulation approximately 50 of the observed values fall within the 95 confidence interval of the simulated outflows which indicates although scheme 3 can give robust estimations of the monthly outflows for the xfjr the simulated results of reservoir outflows are worse than those of reservoir storages this result is consistent with the statistical results shown in table 2 indicating scheme 3 needs to be improved to reflect accurately the connections between reservoir storages and outflows 4 3 validation to validate the simulation capacity of reservoir schemes observed storages and outflows over the xfjr for 1987 1988 are used the calibrated results for scheme 1 see table 1 and scheme 2 α 0 65 β 0 28 and γ 0 07 obtained above are applied to compare with those for scheme 3 fa 1 5 and fb 1 5 fig 7 shows the simulated monthly storages and outflows for 1987 1988 based on the calibrated results for the outflows the rb rrmse and nse values for scheme 3 are 0 01 0 40 and 0 20 respectively which are all better than those for scheme 2 0 05 0 48 and 0 06 respectively for storage scheme 3 clearly matches the observations better than scheme 2 see fig 7 5 discussion the above analysis indicates that the operational purposes of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir e g the xfjr vary with seasons and demands simulating the storage and outflow of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir for a long period is challenging therefore in this study we proposed an improved operation based reservoir scheme to simulate reservoir storage and outflow with limited data of reservoir management then three reservoir schemes were compared in this study using the observed storage and outflow over the xfjr and the simulation results from the vic model for scheme 1 linear regression relationships between the net inflow on day i ii the reservoir storage on day i 1 v i 1 and the variation of reservoir storage on day i δvi are calibrated at a monthly time step for 1965 1984 according to the nse values in table 2 the multilinear regression scheme scheme 1 can provide an approximate estimation for monthly storages but not for monthly outflows moreover 36 3 12 coefficients must be calibrated in scheme 1 because the three parameters of the multiple linear regression equation vary among calendar months this calibration reduces the applicability of the reservoir scheme in hydrological models for scheme 2 several parameters such as α β and γ are calibrated for reservoir operations during the 20 years from 1965 to 1984 scheme 2 could provide a compatible simulation compared to scheme 1 with superior statistical results see table 2 however some concerns are mentioned in this study first the operational purposes of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir e g the xfjr vary with seasons and adequate data e g 20 years in this study are required to capture the variety of operating conditions second scheme 2 with fixed decision based parameters α β and γ represents the fixed operational priority of a reservoir for example the high weight of hydropower generation α 0 65 indicates it will always be the operational priority of the xfjr for 1965 1984 this basically agrees well with the xfjr operational rules before the 1980s however the operational purposes of the xfjr have changed since the 1980s with increasing attention being given to water supply luo 2007 third the calibration can improve the quality of reservoir schemes e g the operation based reservoir scheme developed by wu and chen 2012 however the calibration can also be associated with high uncertainty caused by possible temporal and spatial variations in the optimal parameters which may hinder the model from being used for further simulation since operational rules for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs generally change during seasons and periods the capacity of the operation based scheme with fixed parameters would be limited thus a set of three decision based parameters determined by the functional relationships is used in scheme 3 through comparing the performances of the three reservoir schemes see table 2 figs 4 and 7 we found scheme 3 could not significantly improve the storage and outflow simulations of the xfjr this result might be because the parameters used in this study which are used to describe the functional connections between reservoir outflows and storages are empirical coefficients in scheme 3 two parameters fa and fb are introduced and assigned as 1 5 to determine the impact of the reservoir operation purposes on reservoir storages and outflows eqs 13 and 14 to determine the level of risk in the application of scheme 3 a parameter uncertainty analysis using the glue method was conducted over the xfjr for the simulated monthly storages and outflows within the range of 0 3 for 1965 1984 based on 10 000 runs the ranges of uncertainty vary greatly between simulated outflows and storages see fig 6 the range of uncertainty in fig 6 a contains more than 90 of the observed storage values while the range of uncertainty in fig 6 b contains approximately 50 of the observed outflow values however the uncertainty ranges do not cover all the observed outflow and storage values which indicate the model cannot fully simulate the operational processes of the xfjr on the one hand the model might be affected by the complex operational behaviors of a reservoir for example random factors such as flood control demand from upstream are usually included in the operational rules of a reservoir which can frequently be changed due to different demands from reservoir stakeholders on the other hand selection of a threshold value of the likelihood function has a certain subjectivity e g 0 15 for outflows and 0 5 for storages in this study and different threshold values will produce different uncertainty ranges jin et al 2010 moreover the performance of the reservoir scheme can be improved by using different sets of parameters i e fa and fb for example the nse values in scheme 3 have been improved by approximately 3 0 62 0 60 0 60 100 see the upper panel of fig 6 a and 19 0 19 0 16 0 16 100 see the upper panel of fig 6 b this result indicates the performance of scheme 3 with defined empirical coefficients is limited e g see table 2 from the present study the values of these decision based parameters α β and γ should depend on the changing operational rules and seasons the functional relationships used in this study are regarded as a gateway to evaluate regional water resource security in case of various reservoir operations under future climate change scenarios however the parameters for the functional relationships between outflows and storages require further exploration although this reservoir scheme could provide robust estimations of the outflow and storage of the xfjr the simulation results are inferior to those from swat in the same basin wu and chen 2012 one potential cause of this result is the platform used in this study the performances of the same reservoir scheme would potentially be different based on different platforms for example the nse values for the operation based reservoir schemes i e scheme iii in the study of wu and chen 2012 versus scheme 2 in this study are 0 38 versus 0 26 for outflows and 0 50 versus 0 54 for storages however previous studies e g haddeland et al 2007 adam et al 2007 voisin et al 2013 indicated a reservoir scheme coupled with the vic model could provide valuable information for studying the hydrological effects of dams niu and chen 2010 have comprehensively validated the performance of the vic model over the east river basin moreover investigating the accuracy of the macroscale hydrological model is not the purpose of this study rather our main goal is to propose an improved operation based reservoir scheme to simulate reservoir storage and outflow with limited reservoir management data hence the emphasis is on the comparison of reservoir schemes by using the same platform compared to schemes 1 and 2 scheme 3 provides the functional relationships to represent different operational purposes of a reservoir generally for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs long term observed inflows outflows and storages would not be accessible to the public especially in developing countries thus the improved operation based reservoir scheme is valuable in simulating the outflow and storage of a reservoir without sufficient management data moreover the varying parameters used in scheme 3 represent a set of varying operational rules for a reservoir and they could model the changes of reservoir operations with climate change socioeconomic development water demand and so on thus the parametric functions with empirical coefficients can be of great importance for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs however some issues are not addressed in this study and further studies are needed currently fully describing the dynamics of regulated streamflows remains a large challenge great uncertainties might arise from the host platforms and supporting data as well as the limitations of the reservoir schemes nazemi and wheater 2015 thus major disagreements can be observed between the regulated discharges by using different reservoir schemes voisin et al 2013 although the new reservoir scheme proposed in this study can simulate both storage and outflow values of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir with limited reservoir management data the new reservoir scheme has been evaluated only at the local scale i e the xfjr in south china thus it is not clear how this new reservoir scheme can function in other regions under different climatic conditions regulation levels and operational objectives for future work more extensive validation is required to test the performance of this new reservoir scheme at different scales additionally due to different host platforms e g vic model and supporting data reservoir schemes can show different capacities in the same river basin ongoing improvements including the process representation and parameter identification of the host platforms are recommended in highly regulated regions to help improve the performance of the new reservoir scheme 6 conclusions an improved operation based reservoir scheme for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs is developed in this study to enhance the feasibility and applicability of previous operation based reservoir schemes and to improve the simulation capacity of the vic model the main feature of this reservoir scheme is that varying decision based parameters determined from the real time change in reservoir storage and the inherent characteristics of reservoirs are applied to replace the fixed decision based parameters obtained from the numerical calibration based on the platform of the vic model this reservoir scheme is applied to the xfjr in south china to simulate reservoir storages and outflows then it is compared with two other reservoir schemes as follows the multilinear regression scheme and the operation based reservoir scheme developed by wu and chen 2012 in addition uncertainty analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of parameter uncertainty on the time varying decision based parameters obtained by using the parametric functions the performances of three reservoir schemes were compared and the new reservoir scheme could not significantly improve the storage and outflow simulations of the xfjr especially outflow simulations this result might be because the parameters used in this study to describe the functional connections between reservoir outflow and storage are empirical coefficients which require further exploration overall the improved operation based reservoir scheme is recommended due to the following two advantages one is that the improved operation based reservoir scheme eliminates numerical calibration and uses new parametric functions that consider the operational processes of reservoir in practice to a greater extent the other is that the improved operation based reservoir scheme requires less observed data which can enhance its applicability conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements this

6653,multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs generally need to adjust operational functions for different storage levels most existing reservoir schemes lack the pertinence to model the complex behaviors of such reservoirs this paper proposes an improved operation based reservoir scheme to simulate the storage and outflow variations for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs at a daily time step in this improved reservoir scheme the new parametric functions to represent the weights of the outflow through considering various operation purposes e g hydropower generation flood control and water supply are introduced then the improved reservoir scheme is integrated into a macroscale hydrological model i e variable infiltration capacity vic model in this study the performance of the proposed reservoir scheme is evaluated with the observed storage and outflow of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir xinfengjiang reservoir in south china and compared to two other reservoir schemes i e a multilinear regression reservoir scheme and an operation based reservoir scheme in addition through uncertainty analysis this study shows that the time varying operation based parameters can reflect the changes of reservoir storage but not reservoir outflow indicating that the parameters for establishing functional relationships need further exploration results reveal that the proposed reservoir scheme has a wide applicability for reservoir storage and outflow simulation especially for the reservoirs with limited reservoir management data keywords reservoir scheme variable infiltration capacity vic parametric functions generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue xinfengjiang reservoir 1 introduction the demand for water has been steadily increasing globally along with the expanding population ashoori et al 2017 chen et al 2016 he et al 2018 however freshwater resources are finite and unevenly distributed icold 1998 undp 2006 since the second half of the 20th century reservoirs dams have been continuously constructed to control streamflow and to store water for the purposes of meeting increasing water demands and reducing risks from water related disasters icold 2007 zhou et al 2016 shi et al 2018 more than 45 000 large dams reservoirs with a volume of 8300 km3 have now been built globally chao et al 2008 icold 2007 lehner et al 2011 reservoirs can serve one or more purposes including flood control water supply hydropower generation navigation and recreation icold 2007 in addition reservoirs can be classified into single year and multiyear reservoirs according to the characteristics of reservoir storage and inflow single year reservoirs regulate river discharges at daily monthly seasonal or yearly temporal scales while multiyear reservoirs regulate interannual river discharges skaar and sorgard 2006 given the numerous and complex functions of reservoirs reservoir operations including the release of water to generate hydropower and to supply water downstream and the storage of water during floods can significantly affect river discharges thus questions about reservoir storage and outflow variations and their impacts upon terrestrial hydrological processes have been raised to explore the features of terrestrial hydrological processes and water resource security macroscale hydrological models such as the variable infiltration capacity model vic liang et al 1994 1996 soil and water assessment tools swat arnold et al 1998 the versatile integrator of surface and atmosphere processes visa yang and niu 2003 and the digital yellow river integrated model dyrim wang et al 2007 2015 are usually applied to simulate hydrological processes nevertheless these models do not include numerical schemes for simulating reservoir operations hanasaki et al 2006 because the influence of reservoir operations to terrestrial hydrological processes needs to be quantified numerous attempts have been made to integrate reservoir schemes with these models meigh et al 1999 haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2006 neitsch et al 2002 yates et al 2005a 2005b these schemes have considered decision rules and features of reservoirs to provide the responses of reservoir systems for certain conditions however the schemes mentioned above usually consider one or two functions only thus they cannot reflect the complexity of multipurpose reservoirs for example hanasaki et al 2006 categorized reservoirs into irrigation and nonirrigation purposes and used the inflow dependency approach to simulate reservoir outflows which determined them mainly by irrigation demand moreover the time step of these reservoir schemes are mostly one month since multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs operate over a multiyear temporal scale with multiple purposes the schemes in the studies of meigh et al 1999 haddeland et al 2006 and hanasaki et al 2006 might not be suitable for simulating their outflows and storages to enrich the simulation capabilities of large scale hydrological models wu and chen 2012 developed an operation based scheme to simulate daily outflows of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs the new scheme adopted decision based parameters and purpose based outflow variations to simulate the outflow and storage of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs it can also consider the complexity of such reservoirs however wu and chen 2012 also indicated this reservoir scheme required much input information such as the observed historical discharge and storage to calibrate decision based parameters therefore it might be difficult to apply to reservoirs with limited reservoir management data moreover they indicated time varying decision based parameters might provide better simulation in this study therefore a new scheme is developed based on the operation based reservoir scheme mentioned above it differs by providing functional relationships to estimate decision based parameters depending on the reservoir water level to evaluate the performances of reservoir schemes this study adopts as the platform a widely used macroscale hydrologic model vic liang et al 1994 1996 the vic model has already been coupled with a reservoir scheme in the study of hanasaki et al 2006 which presented an algorithm that could reduce the root mean square error of a reservoir release and river discharge simulation however as mentioned before the reservoir scheme developed by hanasaki et al 2006 mainly considered irrigation demand and lacks the capacity to model the complex behaviors of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs thus a more robust reservoir scheme is needed in summary this study has two objectives one is to further improve the operation based reservoir scheme proposed by wu and chen 2012 with functional decision based parameters the other is to suggest a reasonable reservoir scheme for the vic model to simulate reservoir storage and outflow at the interannual scale in regions with limited reservoir management data the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data used in this study the details of the improved operation based reservoir scheme and other methodologies used in this study are illustrated in section 3 scheme comparisons are included in section 4 followed by discussion and conclusions in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study area and data 2 1 study area xinfengjiang reservoir xfjr is a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir located in heyuan guangdong province china fig 1 it is the largest man made lake in guangdong province with an area of 370 km2 and a storage capacity of 13 9 km3 it is impounded by xinfengjiang dam built in 1962 with a height of 124 m the main functions of the xfjr are hydropower generation flood control irrigation water supply and navigation the reservoir area is dominated by the subtropical monsoon climate and the rainy season is from april to september the operational purposes of the xfjr are related to its corresponding reservoir operation water levels and four important water levels are considered in this study similar to those used in wu and chen 2012 the dead storage level ld critical water level lc flood control water level lp and emergency water level le all those water levels are associated with corresponding water storages vd vc vp and ve respectively for the xfjr the designed emergency storage ve and the dead storage vd are 12 9 km3 and 4 3 km3 respectively the flood control storage vp and the critical storage vc vary with time all of this basic information is plotted in fig 2 2 2 data and objective functions in this study observed daily outflows and storages from the xfjr from 1st january 1965 to 31st december 1984 are used to calibrate the decision based parameters of the operation based reservoir scheme and to compare the performances of reservoir schemes observed daily outflows and storages from 1st january 1987 to 31st december 1988 are used to validate the reservoir schemes to evaluate the performances of reservoir schemes several objective functions are employed including relative bias rb relative root mean square error rrmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse among them rb is used to measure the magnitude of the bias for the variable x and a small absolute value of rb indicates a good performance rrmse provides a measure to estimate the error for the whole simulation process the nse is a normalized statistic to determine the relative magnitude of the residual variance versus the observed data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 which indicates the simulation performance by comparing the plot of the observed and simulated data the nse ranges from to 1 and 1 corresponds to a perfect match of the simulated data to the observed data the equations for computing rb rrmse and the nse are given as follows 1 rb t 1 n x s i m t x o b s t t 1 n x o b s t 2 rrmse t 1 n x o b s t x s i m t 2 n x obs 3 nse 1 t 1 n x s i m t x o b s t 2 t 1 n x o b s t x obs 2 where x s i m t is the simulated value on day t x o b s t is the observed data on the same day and x obs is the long term average value for the observed data 2 3 reservoir inflow this study used the vic model as the platform for reservoir schemes to run the vic model this study adopts daily meteorological data feng et al 2004 including precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures and wind speed soil and vegetation data over the east river basin are extracted from two datasets found in the study of nijssen et al 2001 the global soil dataset and the global vegetation dataset calibrated parameters for the routing process obtained by niu and chen 2010 are used to route the simulated streamflow in this study the temporal resolution is 1 day and the spatial resolution is 1 degree based on the simulated natural streamflow over the xinfengjiang river basin net inflow ii of the xfjr is suggested as follows 4 i i i n i p c p i e v p i d s d t i where ini is the stream inflow into the reservoir simulated by the vic model on day i pcpi is the precipitation over the reservoir evpi is the evaporation over the reservoir and d s d t i is the variation in soil moisture all terms are in the unit of km3 day 1 once the initial storage value is given daily water storages for a period e g 1st january 1965 to 31st december 1984 or 1st january 1987 to 31st december 1988 can be calculated by using one of the three reservoir schemes this study adopts initial storages of 6 28 km3 and 3 40 km3 for the calibration and validation periods respectively these values are the observed xfjr reservoir storages at the beginning of 1965 and the beginning of 1987 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 new operation based reservoir scheme according to the basic features of multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs wu and chen 2012 developed an advanced version of the target release approach the operation based reservoir scheme at a daily time step their scheme considers four reservoir operational purposes flood control hydropower generation water supply and impoundment the current reservoir storage level determines the priority of operational purposes when the reservoir storage level is above le lp which indicates the occurrence of extremely large floods the outflow equals the maximum allowable release of the reservoir when the reservoir storage level exceeds lp le reservoir operations follow flood control the target release approach is adopted to simulate the reservoir release when the storage water level is between lp and ld reservoir operations follow hydropower generation water supply and impoundment when the storage water level is below ld the release is zero the reservoir storage level may exceed lp during floods the target release approach was adopted to simulate the reservoir release in such cases neitsch et al 2002 for the target release approach the reservoir outflow qi m3 day 1 on day i is calculated as follows 5 q i v i v p n d targ where v i m3 is the current volume of water stored in the reservoir on day i v p m3 is the target reservoir storage on day i and ndtarg is the number of days necessary for the reservoir to reach vp the reservoir storage level varies between ld and lp in most cases wu and chen 2012 introduced two important hypotheses for calculating the outflow and storage variations to meet the tradeoff among three operational purposes one is that the outflow on day i qi m3 day 1 consists of two parts the long term average outflow q i m3 day 1 and the variation on day δ q i m3 day 1 thus the outflow could be represented as follows 6 q i q i δ q i the other hypothesis is that the variation of the outflow at a daily time step δ q i consists of three parts δ q p o w i δ q s u p i and δ q r e s i which are the purpose based outflow variations related to hydropower generation downstream water supply and water impoundment respectively wu and chen 2012 the corresponding weights could be determined by three related decision based parameters α β and γ the outflow variation could be calculated as follows 7 δ q i α δ q p o w i β δ q s u p i γ δ q r e s i a simplified method for computing these three purpose based outflow variations was produced by wu and chen 2012 to reduce the complexity of this scheme the computation process assumed these three purpose based outflow variations are proportional to the long term average outflow qi on day i and the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the daily outflows of each calendar month k mon was introduced to represent this proportion thus eq 7 can be represented as below 8 δ q i α η p o w i β η s u p i γ η r e s i k mon q i 9 η p o w i s i s c max s p s c s c s d 10 η sup i i 30 i i 30 i σ 30 i s i s d s p s d 11 η r e s i s p s i s p s d where si is the current storage on day i km3 sc is the critical storage sp is the flood control storage and sd is the dead storage i 30 i and i 30 i are the long term average inflow m3 day 1 and the current inflow for a 30 day period σ 30 i is the standard deviation of the 30 day inflow before day i döll et al 2003 carried out a global river discharge simulation accounting for reservoir operations a parameterization scheme was proposed for natural lakes but was also applied to reservoirs due to the lack of information about reservoirs they modified the model of meigh et al 1999 and parameterized reservoir release as follows 12 q i k r s s min s s min s max s min 1 5 where kr is a release coefficient 0 01 86400 s 1 s is the current storage smax is the maximum reservoir storage and smin is the minimum reservoir storage based on the assumptions produced by döll et al 2003 varying decision based parameters determined by the current storage on a given day replace the fixed decision based parameters three decision based parameters can be defined as below 13 α s i s c s p s d f a 14 β s i s d s p s d f b 15 γ 1 α β to reduce the complexity and improve the applicability of the improved operation based reservoir scheme both fa and fb are defined to be 1 5 as in the equations mentioned by meigh et al 1999 the schematic of the improved operation based reservoir scheme is shown in fig 3 3 2 compared reservoir schemes to evaluate the performance of the new reservoir scheme developed in this study see section 3 1 two other reservoir schemes are used for comparison one is the multilinear regression scheme young 1967 bhaskar and whitlatch 1980 and the other is the operation based reservoir scheme developed by wu and chen 2012 1 multilinear regression scheme linear regression was first proposed by young 1967 to find the optimal release based on reservoir inflows and storages bhaskar and whitlatch 1980 suggested a simple multilinear regression procedure to express the optimal release related to the initial storage and inflow this method was extended by karamouz and houck 1982 in a model called dpr this study applies the multilinear regression scheme used by wu and chen 2012 the equation could be represented as follows 16 δ v i a 1 a 2 v i 1 a 3 i i where δvi is the daily change of the reservoir storage on day i m3 day 1 ii is the net inflow m3 day 1 v i 1 is the reservoir storage on the day i 1 m3 day 1 a1 is the constant term m3 day 1 and a2 day 1 and a3 dimensionless are the coefficients of the multiple linear regression equation the three coefficients a1 a2 and a3 need to be calibrated for the multilinear regression scheme in this study these coefficients are calibrated for each calendar month based on the given initial storage and the net inflow calculated by the vic model at a daily time step from 1965 to 1984 once the daily variation has been decided daily outflows q i i i δ v i and storages v i v i 1 δ v i can be computed the calibrated results of the multilinear regression scheme are listed in table 1 2 operation based reservoir scheme this study adopts the operation based reservoir scheme developed by wu and chen 2012 as the other compared reservoir scheme to simulate daily changes in reservoir outflows and storages as mentioned in section 3 1 the three coefficients α β and γ in eq 7 should be calibrated two parameters α and β are calibrated by using vic simulated inflows and historical xjfr daily storages and outflows from 1965 to 1984 the shuffled complex evolution the university of arizona sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 was adopted to optimize the parameters in this study the nse for reservoir outflow is used as the objective function to identify the values of the model parameters when the objective function is closer to 1 0 the nse for reservoir outflow is closer to 1 0 model performance is better the calibrated values of α and β are 0 65 and 0 28 respectively then the value of parameter γ for weighing water impoundment is 0 07 1 0 65 0 28 with these calibrated parameters xfjr storages and outflows from 1965 to 1984 are simulated 3 3 parameter uncertainty uncertainty analysis is of great concern in the field of hydrology amponsah et al 2016 kuria and vogel 2015 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 to further understand the new operation based reservoir scheme proposed in this study the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 is used to analyze the uncertainty of parameters fa and fb see section 3 1 the glue technique identifies acceptable model parameter combinations within the user defined acceptability threshold to estimate prediction uncertainties the glue method has been widely applied in uncertainty assessments for hydrological models since it was developed in 1992 beven and binley 1992 2014 freer et al 1996 jin et al 2010 lamb et al 1998 muleta and nicklow 2005 mcmichael et al 2006 the glue method includes several steps 1 select parameter sets by monte carlo random sampling method 2 define the likelihood function and the threshold value for selected parameter sets 3 calculate the likelihood values of behavioral parameter sets 4 reassign the likelihood values to obtain a cumulative distribution 5 determine the upper and lower bounds of the forecast results and predict the uncertainty in this study the nse was selected as the likelihood function monthly observed storages and reservoir releases of the xfjr for 1965 1984 are used as the observations for the glue procedure the initial ranges for fa and fb both vary from 0 to 3 the uniformly distributed random parameter sets for fa and fb are obtained by random sampling ten thousand parameter sets are used for the uncertainty analysis to guarantee sufficiency and stability based on the likelihood measure the selected cutoff values are 0 5 and 0 15 for storage and outflow simulations respectively the objectives of carrying two uncertainty analyses one for storage and another for outflow are 1 to provide the match situation of simulated outflows and storages respectively and 2 to recognize the capacity of the model for simulating storages and outflows separately by contrast using the weighted average of the nse for storages and outflows might provide information about the compromised results 4 results 4 1 scheme comparison storages and outflows of the xfjr for 1965 1984 were simulated with the three reservoir schemes scheme 1 or the multilinear regression scheme scheme 2 or the operation based scheme and scheme 3 or the new operation based scheme table 2 gives the statistical results of reservoir outflow and storage simulations in the xfjr for 1965 1984 at daily weekly and monthly scales the temporal resolution of all reservoir storage and outflow simulations by using these three reservoir schemes was 1 day weekly and monthly simulations were obtained by aggregating the daily simulations from table 2 it is observed that the simulated reservoir storages at a monthly time step from scheme 3 are better than those from schemes 1 and 2 based on the nse values for example compared with schemes 1 and 2 the nse values for scheme 3 are improved by 76 4 0 60 0 34 0 6 100 and 16 7 0 60 0 54 0 6 100 respectively for the outflow simulation scheme 3 performs better than scheme 1 but worse than scheme 2 according to the nse values this result might be because scheme 2 performs based on the numerical calibration which makes the optimal reservoir releases easier to find to further compare the results fig 4 shows monthly reservoir storage and outflow simulation results from the three reservoir schemes versus observations over the xfjr for 1965 1984 from fig 4 it can be seen that scheme 1 shows the least variation for both reservoir storage and outflow simulations which cannot reflect their complicated variability for scheme 2 simulated storages match the observations well for 1965 1974 but tend to underestimate reservoir storages after 1975 especially for 1980 1982 this result is because the high proportion of hydropower generation minimizes the variety of operational conditions of the xfjr the simulation results from scheme 3 are in closer agreement with the observations for 1980 1984 than those from scheme 2 the bottom panel of fig 4 shows the observed and simulated outflow at monthly scales none of the simulation results from the schemes match the observations well especially for 1970 1980 however the outflow simulation from scheme 3 is closer to the observations after the 1980s than those from schemes 1 and 2 4 2 parameter uncertainty to obtain a visual impression of the posterior distribution of parameters histograms of parameter samples are plotted in fig 5 for storage both distributions fa and fb deviate from normality the higher probability is assigned near the lower bound for fa and near the upper bound for fb the flat and broad posterior distribution of parameters indicates a high uncertainty in parameters the statistical values in table 3 also indicate this situation the posterior distributions of the parameters have a large range and almost cover the prior distribution range the 95 confidence intervals of the parameters are also given in table 3 for outflows distributions for fa and fb show similar features as the posterior distributions of storage which deviate from normality and are distributed flatly and broadly the higher probabilities for both fa and fb are assigned near the upper bound correlations between the parameters estimated from the glue samples are also shown in table 3 fig 6 shows the median values and 95 confidence intervals of monthly simulated storages based on the posterior parameter distributions by the glue method over the xfjr for 1965 1984 the goodness of the model performance for the reservoir storage simulation can be identified by comparing the observations against the median values from the upper panel of fig 6 a it is observed that the median values of the simulated storage match the observations well the nse for the median values of the simulated storages 0 62 indicates a proper model performance for the reservoir storage simulation meanwhile the 95 confidence interval of the simulated monthly storages is given in fig 6 a more than 90 of the observed values are within the 95 confidence interval which indicates scheme 3 can give robust estimations of the monthly storages for the xfjr in addition a comparison of the observed outflows and the simulated median values is plotted in fig 6 b the nse for the median values of the simulated monthly outflows is 0 19 which shows a better performance than scheme 3 with defined empirical coefficients nse 0 16 moreover the 95 confidence intervals of the simulated monthly outflows are much narrower than those for the simulated monthly storages which indicates that the uncertainty of the streamflow simulation due to the model parameters error is less important than that of the storage simulation approximately 50 of the observed values fall within the 95 confidence interval of the simulated outflows which indicates although scheme 3 can give robust estimations of the monthly outflows for the xfjr the simulated results of reservoir outflows are worse than those of reservoir storages this result is consistent with the statistical results shown in table 2 indicating scheme 3 needs to be improved to reflect accurately the connections between reservoir storages and outflows 4 3 validation to validate the simulation capacity of reservoir schemes observed storages and outflows over the xfjr for 1987 1988 are used the calibrated results for scheme 1 see table 1 and scheme 2 α 0 65 β 0 28 and γ 0 07 obtained above are applied to compare with those for scheme 3 fa 1 5 and fb 1 5 fig 7 shows the simulated monthly storages and outflows for 1987 1988 based on the calibrated results for the outflows the rb rrmse and nse values for scheme 3 are 0 01 0 40 and 0 20 respectively which are all better than those for scheme 2 0 05 0 48 and 0 06 respectively for storage scheme 3 clearly matches the observations better than scheme 2 see fig 7 5 discussion the above analysis indicates that the operational purposes of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir e g the xfjr vary with seasons and demands simulating the storage and outflow of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir for a long period is challenging therefore in this study we proposed an improved operation based reservoir scheme to simulate reservoir storage and outflow with limited data of reservoir management then three reservoir schemes were compared in this study using the observed storage and outflow over the xfjr and the simulation results from the vic model for scheme 1 linear regression relationships between the net inflow on day i ii the reservoir storage on day i 1 v i 1 and the variation of reservoir storage on day i δvi are calibrated at a monthly time step for 1965 1984 according to the nse values in table 2 the multilinear regression scheme scheme 1 can provide an approximate estimation for monthly storages but not for monthly outflows moreover 36 3 12 coefficients must be calibrated in scheme 1 because the three parameters of the multiple linear regression equation vary among calendar months this calibration reduces the applicability of the reservoir scheme in hydrological models for scheme 2 several parameters such as α β and γ are calibrated for reservoir operations during the 20 years from 1965 to 1984 scheme 2 could provide a compatible simulation compared to scheme 1 with superior statistical results see table 2 however some concerns are mentioned in this study first the operational purposes of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir e g the xfjr vary with seasons and adequate data e g 20 years in this study are required to capture the variety of operating conditions second scheme 2 with fixed decision based parameters α β and γ represents the fixed operational priority of a reservoir for example the high weight of hydropower generation α 0 65 indicates it will always be the operational priority of the xfjr for 1965 1984 this basically agrees well with the xfjr operational rules before the 1980s however the operational purposes of the xfjr have changed since the 1980s with increasing attention being given to water supply luo 2007 third the calibration can improve the quality of reservoir schemes e g the operation based reservoir scheme developed by wu and chen 2012 however the calibration can also be associated with high uncertainty caused by possible temporal and spatial variations in the optimal parameters which may hinder the model from being used for further simulation since operational rules for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs generally change during seasons and periods the capacity of the operation based scheme with fixed parameters would be limited thus a set of three decision based parameters determined by the functional relationships is used in scheme 3 through comparing the performances of the three reservoir schemes see table 2 figs 4 and 7 we found scheme 3 could not significantly improve the storage and outflow simulations of the xfjr this result might be because the parameters used in this study which are used to describe the functional connections between reservoir outflows and storages are empirical coefficients in scheme 3 two parameters fa and fb are introduced and assigned as 1 5 to determine the impact of the reservoir operation purposes on reservoir storages and outflows eqs 13 and 14 to determine the level of risk in the application of scheme 3 a parameter uncertainty analysis using the glue method was conducted over the xfjr for the simulated monthly storages and outflows within the range of 0 3 for 1965 1984 based on 10 000 runs the ranges of uncertainty vary greatly between simulated outflows and storages see fig 6 the range of uncertainty in fig 6 a contains more than 90 of the observed storage values while the range of uncertainty in fig 6 b contains approximately 50 of the observed outflow values however the uncertainty ranges do not cover all the observed outflow and storage values which indicate the model cannot fully simulate the operational processes of the xfjr on the one hand the model might be affected by the complex operational behaviors of a reservoir for example random factors such as flood control demand from upstream are usually included in the operational rules of a reservoir which can frequently be changed due to different demands from reservoir stakeholders on the other hand selection of a threshold value of the likelihood function has a certain subjectivity e g 0 15 for outflows and 0 5 for storages in this study and different threshold values will produce different uncertainty ranges jin et al 2010 moreover the performance of the reservoir scheme can be improved by using different sets of parameters i e fa and fb for example the nse values in scheme 3 have been improved by approximately 3 0 62 0 60 0 60 100 see the upper panel of fig 6 a and 19 0 19 0 16 0 16 100 see the upper panel of fig 6 b this result indicates the performance of scheme 3 with defined empirical coefficients is limited e g see table 2 from the present study the values of these decision based parameters α β and γ should depend on the changing operational rules and seasons the functional relationships used in this study are regarded as a gateway to evaluate regional water resource security in case of various reservoir operations under future climate change scenarios however the parameters for the functional relationships between outflows and storages require further exploration although this reservoir scheme could provide robust estimations of the outflow and storage of the xfjr the simulation results are inferior to those from swat in the same basin wu and chen 2012 one potential cause of this result is the platform used in this study the performances of the same reservoir scheme would potentially be different based on different platforms for example the nse values for the operation based reservoir schemes i e scheme iii in the study of wu and chen 2012 versus scheme 2 in this study are 0 38 versus 0 26 for outflows and 0 50 versus 0 54 for storages however previous studies e g haddeland et al 2007 adam et al 2007 voisin et al 2013 indicated a reservoir scheme coupled with the vic model could provide valuable information for studying the hydrological effects of dams niu and chen 2010 have comprehensively validated the performance of the vic model over the east river basin moreover investigating the accuracy of the macroscale hydrological model is not the purpose of this study rather our main goal is to propose an improved operation based reservoir scheme to simulate reservoir storage and outflow with limited reservoir management data hence the emphasis is on the comparison of reservoir schemes by using the same platform compared to schemes 1 and 2 scheme 3 provides the functional relationships to represent different operational purposes of a reservoir generally for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs long term observed inflows outflows and storages would not be accessible to the public especially in developing countries thus the improved operation based reservoir scheme is valuable in simulating the outflow and storage of a reservoir without sufficient management data moreover the varying parameters used in scheme 3 represent a set of varying operational rules for a reservoir and they could model the changes of reservoir operations with climate change socioeconomic development water demand and so on thus the parametric functions with empirical coefficients can be of great importance for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs however some issues are not addressed in this study and further studies are needed currently fully describing the dynamics of regulated streamflows remains a large challenge great uncertainties might arise from the host platforms and supporting data as well as the limitations of the reservoir schemes nazemi and wheater 2015 thus major disagreements can be observed between the regulated discharges by using different reservoir schemes voisin et al 2013 although the new reservoir scheme proposed in this study can simulate both storage and outflow values of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir with limited reservoir management data the new reservoir scheme has been evaluated only at the local scale i e the xfjr in south china thus it is not clear how this new reservoir scheme can function in other regions under different climatic conditions regulation levels and operational objectives for future work more extensive validation is required to test the performance of this new reservoir scheme at different scales additionally due to different host platforms e g vic model and supporting data reservoir schemes can show different capacities in the same river basin ongoing improvements including the process representation and parameter identification of the host platforms are recommended in highly regulated regions to help improve the performance of the new reservoir scheme 6 conclusions an improved operation based reservoir scheme for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs is developed in this study to enhance the feasibility and applicability of previous operation based reservoir schemes and to improve the simulation capacity of the vic model the main feature of this reservoir scheme is that varying decision based parameters determined from the real time change in reservoir storage and the inherent characteristics of reservoirs are applied to replace the fixed decision based parameters obtained from the numerical calibration based on the platform of the vic model this reservoir scheme is applied to the xfjr in south china to simulate reservoir storages and outflows then it is compared with two other reservoir schemes as follows the multilinear regression scheme and the operation based reservoir scheme developed by wu and chen 2012 in addition uncertainty analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of parameter uncertainty on the time varying decision based parameters obtained by using the parametric functions the performances of three reservoir schemes were compared and the new reservoir scheme could not significantly improve the storage and outflow simulations of the xfjr especially outflow simulations this result might be because the parameters used in this study to describe the functional connections between reservoir outflow and storage are empirical coefficients which require further exploration overall the improved operation based reservoir scheme is recommended due to the following two advantages one is that the improved operation based reservoir scheme eliminates numerical calibration and uses new parametric functions that consider the operational processes of reservoir in practice to a greater extent the other is that the improved operation based reservoir scheme requires less observed data which can enhance its applicability conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements this

32 5 and pertains to the overall cost of the bioremediation system in fuzzy α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 conversely the maximum fuzzy interval is related to contaminant plume fragmentation in fuzzy α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 and was found to be 95 1 keywords bioplume iii fuzzy set theory graph model in situ bioremediation of groundwater nsga ii multi objective optimization model 1 introduction groundwater in situ bioremediation is a widely used and cost effective method that is able to successfully transform organic contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbons and especially btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene into mineralized stable end products i e h2o co2 and salts in a designated duration of time prasad and mathur 2009a despite the hydrogeological complexities of contaminated sites in situ bioremediation of groundwater can be managed lee et al 2000 mugunthan and shoemaker 2004 although satisfactory results depend on the involvement of relevant stakeholders li et al 2007 stakeholders involved in environmental management problems such as in situ bioremediation of groundwater systems may have conflicting management strategies based on their perspectives and objectives hence a conflict resolution model is required for stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of the existing conflict and interact constructively to achieve a consensus nandalal and hipel 2007 researh has demonstrated that incorporating simulation models within optimization approaches can result in an affordable strategy for in situ bioremediation management hu et al 2004 2007 some research studies that have used simulation optimization models for optimization of bioremediation systems include linking the contaminant transport simulation model of bioplume iii with the fuzzy mean value based optimization model yang et al 2012 coupling the bioplume ii simulation model with a genetic algorithm ga model akbarnejad nesheli et al 2015 and using artificial neural networks ann support vector machines svm and extreme learning machines elm as proxy simulator models instead of bioplume iii coupled with particle swarm optimization pso yadav et al 2016 also hydrogeological uncertainties that are involved in the process of in situ bioremediation have been analysed in various research studies to have more reliable results using fuzzy set theory probability analysis or stochastic analysis some examples of research studies having considered the inherent uncertainties in bioremediation management include a hybrid fuzzy predictive control system taking into account the

microorganisms benekos et al 2003 and fuzzy ordinary kriging incorporated within a decision model formulation considering spatiotemporal pollutant concentrations under epistemic uncertainty dhar and patil 2012 additional details of using various approaches for bioremediation management under uncertainty can be found in the literature li et al 2007 prasad and mathur 2009b mugunthan and shoemaker 2004 the current research study proposes a multi objective simulation optimization model for in situ bioremediation of groundwater through linking the bioplume iii simulation model and a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii multi objective optimization model two hydrogeologically uncertain parameters namely hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants are analyzed as uncertainties in the multi objective optimization model using the fuzzy transformation method ftm the objectives of the optimization model are the minimization of overall cost the sum of contaminant concentration violating standards as well as contaminant plume fragmentation a compromise outcome is achieved regarding the conflicting viewpoints of stakeholders using the non cooperative game of gmcr ii in the present study the research by raei et al 2017 is extended in order to optimize the in situ bioremediation of groundwater regarding hydrogeological uncertainties raei et al 2017 coupled bioplume iii with the nsga ii multi objective optimization model to find the optimum location and arrangement of injection and extraction wells as well as the flowrate of both types of wells as decision variables of the nsga ii multi objective optimization model there are several novel aspects to the research presented in this papar first in the present study the concentration of oxygen as electron acceptor injected to the contaminant site through injection wells is also considered as decision variable second despite the research of raei et al 2017 in this research the hydrogeological uncertainties i e hydraulic conductivity and ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants are incorporated within the multi objective optimization model of in situ bioremediation system to more comprehensively simulate the natural environment eventually raei et al 2017 used fallback bargaining method to achieve the agreed upon optimal solution on the trade off curve while in the current study graph model for conflict resolution ii gmcr ii is utilized to find the consensus strategy among different stakeholders based on their conflicting priorities to illustrate in gmcr ii the consensus strategy is an equilibrium state which is then linked to the pareto front to achieve the compromise optimal solution gmcr ii is suitable to acquire a compromise solution among various strategies of two or more stakeholders nascimento and freitas 2012 moreover considering irreversible moves and also the ability to characterize the common moves for each decision maker to reach the equilibrium state are among the remarkable advantages of gmcr ii which would be explained thoroughly in section 2 6 hu et al 2002 2 methods 2 1 model framework as mentioned before the bioplume iii simulation model is linked to the nsga ii optimization model in order to achieve optimal values of design decision variables and also to optimize the objective functions the compromise solution among all stakeholders is chosen using the non cooperative game of gmcr ii fig 1 depicts the framework of the intended methodology in five basic steps the first step consists of gathering data and information that describe the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer as well as the contaminant and electron acceptor features which are defined as input data in the bioplume iii simulation model in the second step the bioplume iii simulation model is organized by gridding the contaminant site and specifying the background information of pollutants as well as the initial conditions of the simulation process such as the time interval in the third step integration of the bioplume iii simulation model with the nsga ii optimization model is conducted in which objective functions of the optimization model decision variables and existing uncertain parameters are specified an uncertainty analysis is conducted in the fourth step in order to designate the main uncertain parameters of the multi objective optimization model hydraulic conductivity and ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants ftm is then utilized to determine various scenarios of uncertain parameters to be used in the fuzzy multi objective optimization process the fifth step describes the preferences of different stakeholders toward achieving the equilibrium state which is a consensus state among all decision makers and also a compromise solution on the pareto front the decision variables of the developed optimization model relevant to the system of groundwater in situ bioremediation enter the bioplume iii simulation model in each generation as a result of its incorporation within the nsga ii optimization model and the concentration of contaminants are obtained at the end of the simulation procedure accordingly values pertaining to objective functions are designated considering uncertain parameters and then returned to the fuzzy based optimization model to determine trade off curves between relevant stakeholders details of each step in fig 1 are explained in the following sections 2 2 bioplume iii simulation model natural biological processes for counteracting contaminants in groundwater has led to the deployment of existing in situ biological remediation methods yadav et al 2016 on the one hand regarding the important role of electron acceptors in the attenuation of contaminants from groundwater which are redox reduction oxidation reactions these may be utilized for aerobic metabolism such as oxygen or anaerobic metabolish namely nitrate sulfate iron and carbon dioxide yadav et al 2016 bioplume iii is a simulation model that allows for the investigation of the movement of contaminants electron acceptors and nutrients raei et al 2017 the spatial distribution of contaminant concentration in underground flow is addressed in the bioplume iii simulation model by solving the mass transport equations rifai et al 1997 yang et al 2012 some principal features of the bioplume iii simulation model of underground flow are shown in fig 2 2 3 case study the case study utilized in the present study is one of the efficient approaches in the research of raei et al 2017 with 3 injection wells and 2 extraction wells the area of the hypothetical btex contaminated site which is under bioremediation is 701 5 518 5 m 2 akbarnejad nesheli et al 2015 raei et al 2017 features of the aquifer and other input parameters of the bioplume iii model for simulation of the study area in a 3 year bioremediation process are presented in fig 3 raei et al 2017 there are monitoring wells on every side of the contaminated site for checking the pollutants concentration however they do not have any role in the optimization process in these wells the concentration of pollutants must remain lower than 5 mg l generally the maximum allowable concentration of btex in groundwater is 10 700 300 and 500 mg l respectively world health organization 2006 two kinds of wells which are included in the optimization process are injection and extraction wells when a contamination plume is monitored in groundwater contaminated water is extracted through the extraction wells then oxygen as an electron acceptor and nitrogen or phosphorus as nutrients are added to re injected water through the injection wells 2 4 nsga ii multi objective optimization model as mentioned in previous sections the bioplume iii simulation model is incorporated within the nsga ii optimization model to organize a simulation based optimization methodology for in situ groundwater bioremediation the number of decision variables n dv in the current simulation optimization model of groundwater bioremediation is equal to 34 which is demonstrated in eq 1 the 34 decision variables include water discharge and injected oxygen discharge for three injection wells for three years 3 3 2 18 water discharge for two extraction wells for three years 3 2 1 6 and the location of five injection extraction wells in horizontal and vertical coordinates 5 2 10 the concentration of injected oxygen through the injection wells included in the decision variables is one of the novelties of the present study 1 n dv n y n inj q inj q o 2 n ext q ext c x y n inj n ext where n dv number of decision variables n y number of assessment years n inj number of

objectives of the optimization model the first stakeholder is the ministry of energy moe who is responsible for the overall cost of the in situ bioremediation of groundwater project the moe does not want the overall cost to contravene the limitations in the contract eq 2 shows the components of the cost function which should be minimized as the first objective function of the optimization model of the bioremediation system the second stakeholder is the department of environment doe that wants to decrease the concentration of contaminants violating the quality standards of the groundwater eq 3 includes the details of the second objective function i e the sum of pollutants contravening the groundwater quality standards that should be minimized on the basis of doe s preferences the fragmentation and dispersion of the contaminant plume is the last objective function which is monitored by the national disaster management organization ndmo since its diffusion is related to the number of injection and extraction wells and their location and discharge for additional diffusion additional injection extraction wells are required raei et al 2017 the main preference of ndmo is to minimize the fragmentation and dispersion of the contaminant plume in eq 4 the third objective function that minimizes the number of pollution patches is included in the present study the constraints of the nsga ii optimization model are categorized in three groups 1 at the end of the assessment period of the in situ bioremediation process the pollutant concentration of all nodes in the gridded network of the contaminated site should not contravene the standard limitations details of implementing the first constraint in the nsga ii optimization model are mentioned in eq 5 2a the second constraint of the nsga ii optimization model regards the coordination among hydraulic head and extraction or injection rates hydraulic head at the injection wells should remain lower than the maximum amount to prevent the model from choosing injection rates causing very low concentrations of contaminants which might lead to a short and non standard duration of the in situ bioremediation process 2b conversely hydraulic head in the extraction wells is better to get more than the minimum value to preserve the hydraulic head of the aquifer at a standard level and not extract water beyond a specified range raei et al 2017 eq 6 describes the second constraint of the nsga ii optimization model in the current research study 3 as eqs 7 and 8 express the third constraint of the nsga ii

optimization model coupled with different simulation models is provided in nikoo et al 2015 and khoramshokooh et al 2018 2 5 fuzzy transformation method ftm fuzzy modeling approaches have been widely used for uncertainties in aquifer and hydrogeological parameters through various simulation optimization models of bioremediation processes based on the advantage of applying feasible combinations of the parameters rather than choosing only a random selection prasad and mathur 2009b in the present study ftm was applied to develop a fuzzy optimization model for bioremediation of contaminated groundwater taking into account the inherent uncertainties of hydrogeological parameters two parameters namely hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity were considered as fuzzy uncertain parameters in this study in ftm a set of n independent uncertain parameters p e with membership functions μ p e x e e 1 2 n are decomposed into fuzzy forms of p e with i 1 intervals x e g g 0 1 i which are known as α cuts set p e of α cuts are shown in eqs 9 and 10 hanss 2003 9 p e x e 0 x e 1 x e i with 10 x e g a i g b i g a e g b e g e 1 2 n g 0 1 i according to fig 5 which depicts the decomposition procedure regarding the basic concepts of ftm ν axes is divided into i parts with equal space of δ ν 1 i between them accordingly i 1 levels of membership ν g are acquired hanss and klimke 2004 11 ν g g i g 0 1 i the intervals of every membership level ν g g 0 1 i can then be transformed into a specified number of arrays x e g through the general form of the ftm based on the non monotonic version of the simulation optimization model as follows 12 x e g γ 1 e g γ 2 e g γ i 1 g e g γ 1 e g γ 2 e g γ i 1 g e g i 1 g e 1 i 1 g t u p l e s where 13 γ l e g c l

g are defined as the upper and lower bounds of the interval x e g at the membership level ν g the objective function of the optimization model is depicted by of and is a function of p e while the optimization model is separately solved for each p e 15 q o f p 1 p 2 p n the disintegrated form of the fuzzy valued results q are shown by the arrays z g g 0 1 i 1 where its k th element k z g is 16 k z g f k x 1 g k x 2 g k x n g note that k x 1 g is the k th element of the array x e g accordingly fuzzy results of the model q are obtained in the following decomposed form 17 z g a 1 g b 1 g g 0 1

state are considered in this method i e upper and lower bounds and midpoints then using these feasible combinations on α cut states pertaining to the fuzzy membership function of uncertain parameters conceivable scenarios of uncertain parameters are acquired considering the above mentioned details the general ftm is a dependable approach that can be used in non monotonic water related issues alizadeh et al 2017 2 6 graph model for conflict resolution ii gmcr ii the general concepts of gmcr fang et al 1993 are derived from graph theory as well as game theory regarding various stakeholders nascimento and freitas 2012 independent stakeholders in two party or multi party disputes over environmental issues may have different strategies and try to acquire an equilibrium state which is the preferred resolution gmcr ii can be utilized for coalition analysis as a decision support system by upgrading the gmcr into a windows based support system with higher speed and precision kilgour et al 2001 kilgour 2007 as depicted in fig 6 after defining the conflict there are three main stages in a conflict resolution process through gmcr ii namely modeling the conflict the analysis process and interpretation of the results nandalal and hipel 2007 details of applying gmcr ii are discussed in subsequent sections 2 6 1 fundamentals of gmcr ii a graph model has four constituents fang et al 1993 kilgour and hipel 2005 1 n the number of stakeholders where n 1 2 n 2 s the number of states where 2 s note that the specific state s 0 is called the status quo state 3 u the set of ranked states of the conflict as outcomes of the resolution 4 a set of directed graphs g i s a i i n a i s s to model the conflict through a diagram in which s presents the vertices containing the ranked outcomes of the resolution and a i i n define the set of arcs demonstrating state transitions if s t a i s t then there is no loop for each vertex moreover gmcr ii assumes that preferences of all stakeholders are transitive whereby each stakeholder s preference can be utilized to rank the states of set s states are ranked from the most favorable to the least favorable considering stakeholders preferences kilgour and hipel 2005 2 6 2 modeling a conflict using gmcr ii as shown in fig 6 the first two steps of modeling a dispute is to define the stakeholders and their strategies and their options in gmcr ii then infeasible states should be specified for gmcr ii by the user through any of the four available ways in relevant dialogue boxes mentioned in table 1 gmcr ii eliminates infeasible as well as identical states from the model to obtain sets of states that are possible after introducing the infeasible states to gmcr ii for elimination irreversibility of options can be defined through the allowable state transition dialogue box which includes two methods the first method is single option based in which the user can choose the possibility of changing a selected option by utilizing one way or bidirectional arrows a bidirectional arrow indicates that no restrictions exist on reversing the first option the second method i e multiple option based is also used with the same aim of determining the irreversibility of the transition from one state to another regarding each option in the second method the user enters a pair of patterns simultaneously in which moving from the left pattern to the right pattern is prohibited peng 1999 the last step of modeling a dispute by gmcr ii is pertained to the relative preferences of decision makers about the feasible states using three techniques the first technique for determining the preferences of decision makers is option weighting that asks the user to enter various amounts of weights to the options of a state on the basis of the preferences of decision makers the second technique is called option prioritizing in which the user specifies preference statements in order of priority for each decision maker eventually in the third technique i e direct ranking states can be moved merged or splitted directly by the user on the basis of decision makers priorities 2 6 3 interpretation of the outputs of gmcr ii according to fig 6 after the analysis process of the conflict results need to be interpreted in order to investigate if the states are stable enough to satisfy decision makers and to prevent them from moving unilaterally to other states chu et al 2015 the first step to interpret the results is stability analysis which is conducted to designate the stability of states for all decision makers by checking their foresight and behavioral features under dispute conditions the stability definitions which are known as solution concepts in gmcr ii are briefly explained in table 2 madani and hipel 2011 chu et al 2015 eventually an equilibrium state is achieved when a state is stable due to a specific solution concept which is a consensus resolution for all decision makers nandalal and hipel 2007 the gmcr ii not only provides the individually stable states for each decision maker individually but it also describes the stable states for equilibria nandalal and hipel 2007 it helps the user to recognize the states that are stable for an individual stakeholder but are characterized as unstable in coalition stability analysis the last step to achieve a credible and exact equilibrium is to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine for which parameters of the model the results are more sensitive peng 1999 generally conflict resolution models are based on ordinal models in which a user has a direct role in consecutive stages of modeling as such instead of utilizing sensitivity analysis corresponding to quantitative techniques in conflict resolution model sensitivity testing is used peng 1999 hence sensitivity analysis in gmcr ii has to be carried out in different sessions and by running slightly modified models in addition to the main conflict model the changes can be carried out in one of the stages of modeling the conflict 3 results and discussion the hydrogeological uncertainties in the contaminant groundwater site are due to errors in measuring the parameters as well as insufficient data in this situation the maximum minimum and average values of uncertain parameters are utilized to organize a fuzzy membership function for each parameter in the present study triangular fuzzy membership functions of hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity are composed of three α cut levels 0 0 5 and 1 as shown in fig 7 each α cut level contains various fuzzy intervals with a confidence level of α percent in which the fuzzy parameters are simulated using general ftm there are 9 and 4 combinations of uncertain parameters in α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 respectively as well as 1 combination in α cut level of 1 which results in 14 fuzzy combinations of uncertain parameters the fuzzy optimization model of bioremediation is executed for all combinations of two fuzzy uncertain parameters to extract trade off curves for each combination the details of the nsga ii multi objective optimization algorithm are defined as follows the population size on the basis of a trial and error procedure is regarded as 10 times more than the number of decision variables of the optimization model which is 340 34 10 in the current study moreover the maximum generation crossover and mutation rates are 100 0 8 and 0 2 respectively eventually 28 optimal solutions among the objective functions of the decision makers are obtained for each trade off curve an example of the trade off curve which is related to the 4th fuzzy combination of uncertain parameters in α cut 0 5 is depicted in fig 8 in order to choose the best optimal point among the existing alternatives on each trade off curve gmcr ii is applied hence optimal values of objective functions on trade off curves are sorted from the smallest to the largest then for each trade of curve some intervals are defined for decision maker s objective functions and an option is assigned to each interval regarding the extremum values of the interval as the first step of adding the input parameters into gmcr ii doe and moe proposed 5 options individually and ndmo proposed 2 strategies these 12 options as well as the first preference of decision makers related to each option state of options are shown in table 3 which can be arranged in 212 12 options and 2 yes or no choices states as the next step of gmcr ii among all these states there are some infeasible states which cannot occur simultaneously for instance according to table 3 and on the basis of decision makers insight options 6 and 8 are infeasible states and would be omitted from the final states by the gmcr ii analysis engine to illustrate option 6 declares the intention of doe to accept and continue the policies of the bioremediation contract while option 8 states that doe wants to change the financial budget of the bioremediation process which is contrary to option 6 infeasible states of the bioremediation conflict resolution model are deleted based on the constraints and limitations exerted on the states through three of the methods mentioned in table 1 namely mutually exclusive options option dependence and direct specification of infeasibility accordingly 18 feasible states remained for the subsequent steps of the gmcr ii analysis the three relevant dialogue boxes of gmcr ii for the three methods are presented in tables s1 s3 in the supplementary material following this the preferences of the decision makers are applied to the 18 possible states and are ranked from the highest to the lowest priority via model analysis table 4 depicts the results of sorting the states for the bioremediation conflict model based on the preferences of doe as mentioned in table 4 the preferred state is the 18th state which indicates that options 2 7 8 9 and 10 defined in table 3 should be selected as yes this means that the preferred state for doe is a situation in which moe wants to designate the maximum overall cost of the bioremediation project option 2 in table 3 considering the financial requirements of doe to increase the quality of the bioremediation process option 8 in table 3 also doe can increase the number of observation wells to assess if the bioremediation process was satisfactory option 9 in table 3 if the concentration of pollutants in the groundwater violates the standards the doe can highlight the critical problem of groundwater pollution option 7 in table 3 and possibly launch a complaint about the ndmo if the required actions do not take place option 10 in table 3 the results of ranking the possible states according to the priorities of stakeholders are demonstrated in table 5 note that only the number of states are shown in table 5 and the yes or no options of each state is the same as that in table 4 in table 6 the final equilibrium states are show and are based on the simultaneous consideration of the preferred states of the decision makers equilibrium states are the states that decision makers accept as suitable choices and they tend to stay within these states to achieve the most preferred outcome it can be seen from table 6 that states 16 and 18 are the equilibria states stability analysis is then conducted to assess the different behaviors of the decision makers regarding the bioremediation conflict this is helpful to determine the final resolution equilibrium state hipel et al 1997 according to table 7 the second column shows that the equilibria states 16 and 18 obtained from the main gmcr ii are stable under the six solution concepts introduced in section 2 6 3 this means that states 16 and 18 can be a suitable outcome for various types of decision makers with different degrees of foresight madani and hipel 2011 as the last step of using gmcr ii for the bioremediation process a sensitivity test is conducted in order to assess if the equilibria states are robust in the case of changing the input data of the gmcr ii in the modeling step for the sensitivity test of the current bioremediation conflict a new conflict model is developed in gmcr ii with slight changes in the input data such as a new option that is added to the strategies of ndmo and new weights that are assigned to the options of the three decision makers based on their preferences stability analysis results of gmcr ii for the sensitivity test are depicted in the third column of table 7 it is clear from table 7 that states 18 and 10 as the equilibria states of the sensitivity test are stable under the previously mentioned solution concepts as such comparing the 2nd and the 3rd column state 18 is selected as the robust equilibrium state of the bioremediation conflict model according to table 4 state 18 has five options selected as yes options 2 7 8 9 and 10 each of these options are related to one interval of optimal alternatives on the trade off curves for three α cut levels obtained from the fuzzy optimization model in order to determine the agreed upon point the mutual part of these intervals is specified and the average of the involved solutions of the mutual part is calculated regarding the chosen consensus solutions on the trade off curves as a result of using gmcr ii the lower and upper bounds of the objective functions of the decision makers in the fuzzy optimization model are obtained for each α cut level table 8 presents the fuzzy range of objectives of the decision makers for three α cut levels on the basis of the outcomes of gmcr ii as stated in table 8 for each decision maker the lower bound of the objective functions in α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 have the maximum and minimum values respectively also the variation trend of the maximum values related to the different objective functions decreases when the confidence level increases from a α cut level of 0 to 1 after using gmcr ii to reach the optimal consensus solution on the pareto front curves among the three decision makers fuzzy objective functions are obtained regarding the preferences of the decision makers fuzzy membership functions of the different objective functions are presented in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that variations of these fuzzy objective functions in particular intervals for each α cut level can be distinguished from the left and right fuzzy sides of the diagram fig 9a shows that the fuzzy optimal values for the overall cost of the project objective function of moe at a α cut level of 0 changes between 143364 32 and 212443 71 by increasing the value of the α cut level from 0 to 1 in fig 9a variations in the optimal values for the overall cost of the project in the fuzzy right side of the diagram is lower than that in the fuzzy left side in fig 9b the fuzzy interval related to the sum of contaminant concentration in α cut 0 varies between 5 93 mg l and 46 6 mg l considering the fuzzy intervals of different objective functions in fig 9a 9b and 9c it can be seen that for different fuzzy α cut levels the values of fuzzy membership functions of contaminant plume fragmentation fig 9c are symmetric decision variables related to the compromise point on the pareto front curves are also taken into consideration the maximum and minimum values of decision variables of the fuzzy multi objective optimization model of bioremediation are presented in tables 9 11 for fuzzy α cut levels as can be seen tables 9 and 10 show the fuzzy ranges of injection and extraction discharges for a three year assessment duration for three α cut levels from 0 to 1 for three injection and two extraction wells respectively in table 11 extremum values of the location of these wells are provided for fuzzy α cut levels in the form of vertical and horizontal coordinates as the last decision variable fuzzy ranges of injecting oxygen though three injection wells for three fuzzy α cut levels from 0 to 1 are indicated in fig 10 for three years of monitoring the in situ bioremediation process it can be seen from fig 10 that for all bounds related to the values of injecting oxygen in different α cut levels from 0 to 1 an increasig trend is observed in the first year of assessment number 1 2 and 3 in the second year of monitoring the bioremediation process number 4 5 and 6 the trend of each bound values of injecting oxygen apart from the values of α cut level 1 e decreases the minimum value of all α cut levels occurs in the second year of assessment number 4 5 and 6 except the lower bound of α cut 0 for which the minimum value exists in the third year of assessing the bioremediation process number 9 4 summary and conclusions in this study a fuzzy optimization model was developed for the bioremediation of groundwater using general ftm three decision makers were involved in the bioremediation management system with conflicting strategies general ftm was used to consider two uncertain parameters i e hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants in the multi objective optimization model to achieve more dependable outcomes the range of variations in the mentioned uncertain parameters was 50 on the basis of trial and error and the opinions of experts following this pareto optimal solutions among the three decision makers objective functions were obtained from the fuzzy multi objective optimization model and then gmcr ii was utilized to obtain the best consensus optimal alternative for the trade off curves the bjective functions and their corresponding decision variables were calculated through fuzzy ranges results show that the minimum fuzzy interval was 32 5 and pertains to the overall cost of the bioremediation system at fuzzy α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 conversely the maximum fuzzy interval of 95 1 was related to contaminant plume fragmentation at fuzzy α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 for future studies in order to reduce the run time of the simulation optimization model a meta model could be used on the basis of repeated execution of a validated simulation model such as bioplume iii in addition inherent uncertainties in the model parameters in the present study were considered as fuzzy parameters however some of the input parameters of the model were interval number uncertainties hence developing a hybrid model that takes into account both fuzzy and interval uncertainties could be a useful approach in which a nonlinear interval number

6654,in this research study a fuzzy multi objective optimization methodology is proposed for in situ groundwater bioremediation utilizing the graph model for conflict resolution in the current model uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants are considered using the fuzzy transformation method ftm first the bioplume iii simulation model is linked with a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii multi objective optimization model to optimize a groundwater bioremediation system regarding conflicting viewpoints of decision makers then the hydrogeological uncertainties of the groundwater bioremediation system are included in the proposed methodology using ftm the three main objectives of the in situ bioremediation optimization model are overall cost well installation treatment or pumping and facility capital the sum of contaminant concentration violating any standards and contaminant plume fragmentation which need to be minimized based on stakeholders preferences subsequently gmcr ii is utilized to resolve any conflicts between the perspectives of the stakeholders to achieve a compromise solution the performance assessment results represent the ability of the proposed methodology for optimal in situ groundwater bioremediation results show that the minimum fuzzy interval is 32 5 and pertains to the overall cost of the bioremediation system in fuzzy α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 conversely the maximum fuzzy interval is related to contaminant plume fragmentation in fuzzy α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 and was found to be 95 1 keywords bioplume iii fuzzy set theory graph model in situ bioremediation of groundwater nsga ii multi objective optimization model 1 introduction groundwater in situ bioremediation is a widely used and cost effective method that is able to successfully transform organic contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbons and especially btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene into mineralized stable end products i e h2o co2 and salts in a designated duration of time prasad and mathur 2009a despite the hydrogeological complexities of contaminated sites in situ bioremediation of groundwater can be managed lee et al 2000 mugunthan and shoemaker 2004 although satisfactory results depend on the involvement of relevant stakeholders li et al 2007 stakeholders involved in environmental management problems such as in situ bioremediation of groundwater systems may have conflicting management strategies based on their perspectives and objectives hence a conflict resolution model is required for stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of the existing conflict and interact constructively to achieve a consensus nandalal and hipel 2007 researh has demonstrated that incorporating simulation models within optimization approaches can result in an affordable strategy for in situ bioremediation management hu et al 2004 2007 some research studies that have used simulation optimization models for optimization of bioremediation systems include linking the contaminant transport simulation model of bioplume iii with the fuzzy mean value based optimization model yang et al 2012 coupling the bioplume ii simulation model with a genetic algorithm ga model akbarnejad nesheli et al 2015 and using artificial neural networks ann support vector machines svm and extreme learning machines elm as proxy simulator models instead of bioplume iii coupled with particle swarm optimization pso yadav et al 2016 also hydrogeological uncertainties that are involved in the process of in situ bioremediation have been analysed in various research studies to have more reliable results using fuzzy set theory probability analysis or stochastic analysis some examples of research studies having considered the inherent uncertainties in bioremediation management include a hybrid fuzzy predictive control system taking into account the uncertainty that exists in the bioremediation simulation model hu et al 2002 a stochastic risk analysis of a bioremediation system with uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity and distribution of microorganisms benekos et al 2003 and fuzzy ordinary kriging incorporated within a decision model formulation considering spatiotemporal pollutant concentrations under epistemic uncertainty dhar and patil 2012 additional details of using various approaches for bioremediation management under uncertainty can be found in the literature li et al 2007 prasad and mathur 2009b mugunthan and shoemaker 2004 the current research study proposes a multi objective simulation optimization model for in situ bioremediation of groundwater through linking the bioplume iii simulation model and a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii multi objective optimization model two hydrogeologically uncertain parameters namely hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants are analyzed as uncertainties in the multi objective optimization model using the fuzzy transformation method ftm the objectives of the optimization model are the minimization of overall cost the sum of contaminant concentration violating standards as well as contaminant plume fragmentation a compromise outcome is achieved regarding the conflicting viewpoints of stakeholders using the non cooperative game of gmcr ii in the present study the research by raei et al 2017 is extended in order to optimize the in situ bioremediation of groundwater regarding hydrogeological uncertainties raei et al 2017 coupled bioplume iii with the nsga ii multi objective optimization model to find the optimum location and arrangement of injection and extraction wells as well as the flowrate of both types of wells as decision variables of the nsga ii multi objective optimization model there are several novel aspects to the research presented in this papar first in the present study the concentration of oxygen as electron acceptor injected to the contaminant site through injection wells is also considered as decision variable second despite the research of raei et al 2017 in this research the hydrogeological uncertainties i e hydraulic conductivity and ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants are incorporated within the multi objective optimization model of in situ bioremediation system to more comprehensively simulate the natural environment eventually raei et al 2017 used fallback bargaining method to achieve the agreed upon optimal solution on the trade off curve while in the current study graph model for conflict resolution ii gmcr ii is utilized to find the consensus strategy among different stakeholders based on their conflicting priorities to illustrate in gmcr ii the consensus strategy is an equilibrium state which is then linked to the pareto front to achieve the compromise optimal solution gmcr ii is suitable to acquire a compromise solution among various strategies of two or more stakeholders nascimento and freitas 2012 moreover considering irreversible moves and also the ability to characterize the common moves for each decision maker to reach the equilibrium state are among the remarkable advantages of gmcr ii which would be explained thoroughly in section 2 6 hu et al 2002 2 methods 2 1 model framework as mentioned before the bioplume iii simulation model is linked to the nsga ii optimization model in order to achieve optimal values of design decision variables and also to optimize the objective functions the compromise solution among all stakeholders is chosen using the non cooperative game of gmcr ii fig 1 depicts the framework of the intended methodology in five basic steps the first step consists of gathering data and information that describe the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer as well as the contaminant and electron acceptor features which are defined as input data in the bioplume iii simulation model in the second step the bioplume iii simulation model is organized by gridding the contaminant site and specifying the background information of pollutants as well as the initial conditions of the simulation process such as the time interval in the third step integration of the bioplume iii simulation model with the nsga ii optimization model is conducted in which objective functions of the optimization model decision variables and existing uncertain parameters are specified an uncertainty analysis is conducted in the fourth step in order to designate the main uncertain parameters of the multi objective optimization model hydraulic conductivity and ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants ftm is then utilized to determine various scenarios of uncertain parameters to be used in the fuzzy multi objective optimization process the fifth step describes the preferences of different stakeholders toward achieving the equilibrium state which is a consensus state among all decision makers and also a compromise solution on the pareto front the decision variables of the developed optimization model relevant to the system of groundwater in situ bioremediation enter the bioplume iii simulation model in each generation as a result of its incorporation within the nsga ii optimization model and the concentration of contaminants are obtained at the end of the simulation procedure accordingly values pertaining to objective functions are designated considering uncertain parameters and then returned to the fuzzy based optimization model to determine trade off curves between relevant stakeholders details of each step in fig 1 are explained in the following sections 2 2 bioplume iii simulation model natural biological processes for counteracting contaminants in groundwater has led to the deployment of existing in situ biological remediation methods yadav et al 2016 on the one hand regarding the important role of electron acceptors in the attenuation of contaminants from groundwater which are redox reduction oxidation reactions these may be utilized for aerobic metabolism such as oxygen or anaerobic metabolish namely nitrate sulfate iron and carbon dioxide yadav et al 2016 bioplume iii is a simulation model that allows for the investigation of the movement of contaminants electron acceptors and nutrients raei et al 2017 the spatial distribution of contaminant concentration in underground flow is addressed in the bioplume iii simulation model by solving the mass transport equations rifai et al 1997 yang et al 2012 some principal features of the bioplume iii simulation model of underground flow are shown in fig 2 2 3 case study the case study utilized in the present study is one of the efficient approaches in the research of raei et al 2017 with 3 injection wells and 2 extraction wells the area of the hypothetical btex contaminated site which is under bioremediation is 701 5 518 5 m

presented in fig 3 raei et al 2017 there are monitoring wells on every side of the contaminated site for checking the pollutants concentration however they do not have any role in the optimization process in these wells the concentration of pollutants must remain lower than 5 mg l generally the maximum allowable concentration of btex in groundwater is 10 700 300 and 500 mg l respectively world health organization 2006 two kinds of wells which are included in the optimization process are injection and extraction wells when a contamination plume is monitored in groundwater contaminated water is extracted through the extraction wells then oxygen as an electron acceptor and nitrogen or phosphorus as nutrients are added to re injected water through the injection wells 2 4 nsga ii multi objective optimization model as mentioned in previous sections the bioplume iii simulation model is incorporated within the nsga ii optimization model to organize a simulation based optimization methodology for in situ groundwater bioremediation the number of decision variables n dv in the current simulation optimization model of groundwater bioremediation is equal to 34 which is demonstrated in eq 1 the 34 decision variables include water discharge and injected oxygen discharge for three injection wells for three years 3 3 2 18 water discharge for two extraction wells for three years 3 2 1 6 and the location of five injection extraction wells in horizontal and vertical coordinates 5 2 10 the concentration of injected oxygen through the injection wells included in the decision

objectives of the optimization model the first stakeholder is the ministry of energy moe who is responsible for the overall cost of the in situ bioremediation of groundwater project the moe does not want the overall cost to contravene the limitations in the contract eq 2 shows the components of the cost function which should be minimized as the first objective function of the optimization model of the bioremediation system the second stakeholder is the department of environment doe that wants to decrease the concentration of contaminants violating the quality standards of the groundwater eq 3 includes the details of the second objective function i e the sum of pollutants contravening the groundwater quality standards that should be minimized on the basis of doe s preferences the fragmentation and dispersion of the contaminant plume is the last objective function which is monitored by the national disaster management organization ndmo since its diffusion is related to the number of injection and extraction wells and their location and discharge for additional diffusion additional injection extraction wells are required raei et al 2017 the main preference of ndmo is to minimize the fragmentation and dispersion of the contaminant plume in eq 4 the third objective function that minimizes the number of pollution patches is included in the present study the constraints of the nsga ii optimization model are categorized in three groups 1 at the end of the assessment period of the in situ bioremediation process the pollutant concentration of all nodes in the gridded network of the contaminated site should not contravene the standard limitations details of implementing the first constraint in the nsga ii optimization model are mentioned in eq 5 2a the second constraint of the nsga ii optimization model regards the coordination among hydraulic head and extraction or injection rates hydraulic head at the injection wells should remain lower than the maximum amount to prevent the model from choosing injection rates causing very low concentrations of contaminants which might lead to a short and non standard duration of the in situ bioremediation process 2b conversely hydraulic head in the extraction wells is better to get more than the minimum value to preserve the hydraulic head of the aquifer at a standard level and not extract water beyond a specified range raei et al 2017 eq 6 describes the second constraint of the nsga ii optimization model in the current research study 3 as eqs 7 and 8 express the third constraint of the nsga ii optimization model is the necessity of maintaining the injection and extraction discharges below the injection and extraction capacity of the existing wells minimize 2 u 1 t 1 t 1 1 d r t w 1 n tot c

optimization model coupled with different simulation models is provided in nikoo et al 2015 and khoramshokooh et al 2018 2 5 fuzzy transformation method ftm fuzzy modeling approaches have been widely used for uncertainties in aquifer and hydrogeological parameters through various simulation optimization models of bioremediation processes based on the advantage of applying feasible combinations of the parameters rather than choosing only a random selection prasad and mathur 2009b in the present study ftm was applied to develop a fuzzy optimization model for bioremediation of contaminated groundwater taking into account the inherent uncertainties of hydrogeological parameters two parameters namely hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity were considered as fuzzy uncertain parameters in this study in ftm a set of n independent uncertain parameters p e with membership functions μ p e x e e 1 2 n are decomposed into fuzzy forms of p e with i 1 intervals x e g g 0 1 i which are known as α cuts set p e of α cuts are shown in eqs 9 and 10 hanss 2003 9 p e x e 0 x e 1 x e i with 10 x e g a i g b i g a e g b e g e 1 2 n g 0 1 i according to fig 5 which depicts the decomposition procedure regarding the basic concepts of ftm ν axes is divided into i parts with equal space of δ ν 1 i between them accordingly i 1 levels of membership ν g are acquired hanss and klimke 2004 11 ν g g i g 0 1 i the intervals of every membership level ν g g 0 1 i can then be transformed into a specified number of arrays x e g through the general form of the ftm based on the non monotonic version of the simulation optimization model as follows 12 x e g γ 1 e g γ 2 e g γ i 1 g e g γ 1 e g γ 2 e g γ i 1 g e g i 1 g e 1 i 1 g t u p l e s where 13 γ l e g c l

g are defined as the upper and lower bounds of the interval x e g at the membership level ν g the objective function of the optimization model is depicted by of and is a function of p e while the optimization model is separately solved for each p e 15 q o f p 1 p 2 p n the disintegrated form of the fuzzy valued results q are shown by the arrays z g g 0 1 i 1 where its k th element k z g is 16 k z g f k x 1 g k x 2 g k x n g note that k x 1 g is the k th element of the array x e g accordingly fuzzy results of the model q are obtained in the following decomposed form 17 z g a 1 g b 1 g g 0 1

state are considered in this method i e upper and lower bounds and midpoints then using these feasible combinations on α cut states pertaining to the fuzzy membership function of uncertain parameters conceivable scenarios of uncertain parameters are acquired considering the above mentioned details the general ftm is a dependable approach that can be used in non monotonic water related issues alizadeh et al 2017 2 6 graph model for conflict resolution ii gmcr ii the general concepts of gmcr fang et al 1993 are derived from graph theory as well as game theory regarding various stakeholders nascimento and freitas 2012 independent stakeholders in two party or multi party disputes over environmental issues may have different strategies and try to acquire an equilibrium state which is the preferred resolution gmcr ii can be utilized for coalition analysis as a decision support system by upgrading the gmcr into a windows based support system with higher speed and precision kilgour et al 2001 kilgour 2007 as depicted in fig 6 after defining the conflict there are three main stages in a conflict resolution process through gmcr ii namely modeling the conflict the analysis process and interpretation of the results nandalal and hipel 2007 details of applying gmcr ii are discussed in subsequent sections 2 6 1 fundamentals of gmcr ii a graph model has four constituents fang et al 1993 kilgour and hipel 2005 1 n the number of stakeholders where n 1 2 n 2 s the number of states where 2 s note that the specific state s 0 is called the status quo state 3 u the set of ranked states of the conflict as outcomes of the resolution 4 a set of directed graphs g i s a i i n a i s s to model the conflict through a diagram in which s presents the vertices containing the ranked outcomes of the resolution and a i i n define the set of arcs demonstrating state transitions if s t a i s t then there is no loop for each vertex moreover gmcr ii assumes that preferences of all stakeholders are transitive whereby each stakeholder s preference can be utilized to rank the states of set s states are ranked from the most favorable to the least favorable considering stakeholders preferences kilgour and hipel 2005 2 6 2 modeling a conflict using gmcr ii as shown in fig 6 the first two steps of modeling a dispute is to define the stakeholders and their strategies and their options in gmcr ii then infeasible states should be specified for gmcr ii by the user through any of the four available ways in relevant dialogue boxes mentioned in table 1 gmcr ii eliminates infeasible as well as identical states from the model to obtain sets of states that are possible after introducing the infeasible states to gmcr ii for elimination irreversibility of options can be defined through the allowable state transition dialogue box which includes two methods the first method is single option based in which the user can choose the possibility of changing a selected option by utilizing one way or bidirectional arrows a bidirectional arrow indicates that no restrictions exist on reversing the first option the second method i e multiple option based is also used with the same aim of determining the irreversibility of the transition from one state to another regarding each option in the second method the user enters a pair of patterns simultaneously in which moving from the left pattern to the right pattern is prohibited peng 1999 the last step of modeling a dispute by gmcr ii is pertained to the relative preferences of decision makers about the feasible states using three techniques the first technique for determining the preferences of decision makers is option weighting that asks the user to enter various amounts of weights to the options of a state on the basis of the preferences of decision makers the second technique is called option prioritizing in which the user specifies preference statements in order of priority for each decision maker eventually in the third technique i e direct ranking states can be moved merged or splitted directly by the user on the basis of decision makers priorities 2 6 3 interpretation of the outputs of gmcr ii according to fig 6 after the analysis process of the conflict results need to be interpreted in order to investigate if the states are stable enough to satisfy decision makers and to prevent them from moving unilaterally to other states chu et al 2015 the first step to interpret the results is stability analysis which is conducted to designate the stability of states for all decision makers by checking their foresight and behavioral features under dispute conditions the stability definitions which are known as solution concepts in gmcr ii are briefly explained in table 2 madani and hipel 2011 chu et al 2015 eventually an equilibrium state is achieved when a state is stable due to a specific solution concept which is a consensus resolution for all decision makers nandalal and hipel 2007 the gmcr ii not only provides the individually stable states for each decision maker individually but it also describes the stable states for equilibria nandalal and hipel 2007 it helps the user to recognize the states that are stable for an individual stakeholder but are characterized as unstable in coalition stability analysis the last step to achieve a credible and exact equilibrium is to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine for which parameters of the model the results are more sensitive peng 1999 generally conflict resolution models are based on ordinal models in which a user has a direct role in consecutive stages of modeling as such instead of utilizing sensitivity analysis corresponding to quantitative techniques in conflict resolution model sensitivity testing is used peng 1999 hence sensitivity analysis in gmcr ii has to be carried out in different sessions and by running slightly modified models in addition to the main conflict model the changes can be carried out in one of the stages of modeling the conflict 3 results and discussion the hydrogeological uncertainties in the contaminant groundwater site are due to errors in measuring the parameters as well as insufficient data in this situation the maximum minimum and average values of uncertain parameters are utilized to organize a fuzzy membership function for each parameter in the present study triangular fuzzy membership functions of hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity are composed of three α cut levels 0 0 5 and 1 as shown in fig 7 each α cut level contains various fuzzy intervals with a confidence level of α percent in which the fuzzy parameters are simulated using general ftm there are 9 and 4 combinations of uncertain parameters in α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 respectively as well as 1 combination in α cut level of 1 which results in 14 fuzzy combinations of uncertain parameters the fuzzy optimization model of bioremediation is executed for all combinations of two fuzzy uncertain parameters to extract trade off curves for each combination the details of the nsga ii multi objective optimization algorithm are defined as follows the population size on the basis of a trial and error procedure is regarded as 10 times more than the number of decision variables of the optimization model which is 340 34 10 in the current study moreover the maximum generation crossover and mutation rates are 100 0 8 and 0 2 respectively eventually 28 optimal solutions among the objective functions of the decision makers are obtained for each trade off curve an example of the trade off curve which is related to the 4th fuzzy combination of uncertain parameters in α cut 0 5 is depicted in fig 8 in order to choose the best optimal point among the existing alternatives on each trade off curve gmcr ii is applied hence optimal values of objective functions on trade off curves are sorted from the smallest to the largest then for each trade of curve some intervals are defined for decision maker s objective functions and an option is assigned to each interval regarding the extremum values of the interval as the first step of adding the input parameters into gmcr ii doe and moe proposed 5 options individually and ndmo proposed 2 strategies these 12 options as well as the first preference of decision makers related to each option state of options are shown in table 3 which can be arranged in 212 12 options and 2 yes or no choices states as the next step of gmcr ii among all these states there are some infeasible states which cannot occur simultaneously for instance according to table 3 and on the basis of decision makers insight options 6 and 8 are infeasible states and would be omitted from the final states by the gmcr ii analysis engine to illustrate option 6 declares the intention of doe to accept and continue the policies of the bioremediation contract while option 8 states that doe wants to change the financial budget of the bioremediation process which is contrary to option 6 infeasible states of the bioremediation conflict resolution model are deleted based on the constraints and limitations exerted on the states through three of the methods mentioned in table 1 namely mutually exclusive options option dependence and direct specification of infeasibility accordingly 18 feasible states remained for the subsequent steps of the gmcr ii analysis the three relevant dialogue boxes of gmcr ii for the three methods are presented in tables s1 s3 in the supplementary material following this the preferences of the decision makers are applied to the 18 possible states and are ranked from the highest to the lowest priority via model analysis table 4 depicts the results of sorting the states for the bioremediation conflict model based on the preferences of doe as mentioned in table 4 the preferred state is the 18th state which indicates that options 2 7 8 9 and 10 defined in table 3 should be selected as yes this means that the preferred state for doe is a situation in which moe wants to designate the maximum overall cost of the bioremediation project option 2 in table 3 considering the financial requirements of doe to increase the quality of the bioremediation process option 8 in table 3 also doe can increase the number of observation wells to assess if the bioremediation process was satisfactory option 9 in table 3 if the concentration of pollutants in the groundwater violates the standards the doe can highlight the critical problem of groundwater pollution option 7 in table 3 and possibly launch a complaint about the ndmo if the required actions do not take place option 10 in table 3 the results of ranking the possible states according to the priorities of stakeholders are demonstrated in table 5 note that only the number of states are shown in table 5 and the yes or no options of each state is the same as that in table 4 in table 6 the final equilibrium states are show and are based on the simultaneous consideration of the preferred states of the decision makers equilibrium states are the states that decision makers accept as suitable choices and they tend to stay within these states to achieve the most preferred outcome it can be seen from table 6 that states 16 and 18 are the equilibria states stability analysis is then conducted to assess the different behaviors of the decision makers regarding the bioremediation conflict this is helpful to determine the final resolution equilibrium state hipel et al 1997 according to table 7 the second column shows that the equilibria states 16 and 18 obtained from the main gmcr ii are stable under the six solution concepts introduced in section 2 6 3 this means that states 16 and 18 can be a suitable outcome for various types of decision makers with different degrees of foresight madani and hipel 2011 as the last step of using gmcr ii for the bioremediation process a sensitivity test is conducted in order to assess if the equilibria states are robust in the case of changing the input data of the gmcr ii in the modeling step for the sensitivity test of the current bioremediation conflict a new conflict model is developed in gmcr ii with slight changes in the input data such as a new option that is added to the strategies of ndmo and new weights that are assigned to the options of the three decision makers based on their preferences stability analysis results of gmcr ii for the sensitivity test are depicted in the third column of table 7 it is clear from table 7 that states 18 and 10 as the equilibria states of the sensitivity test are stable under the previously mentioned solution concepts as such comparing the 2nd and the 3rd column state 18 is selected as the robust equilibrium state of the bioremediation conflict model according to table 4 state 18 has five options selected as yes options 2 7 8 9 and 10 each of these options are related to one interval of optimal alternatives on the trade off curves for three α cut levels obtained from the fuzzy optimization model in order to determine the agreed upon point the mutual part of these intervals is specified and the average of the involved solutions of the mutual part is calculated regarding the chosen consensus solutions on the trade off curves as a result of using gmcr ii the lower and upper bounds of the objective functions of the decision makers in the fuzzy optimization model are obtained for each α cut level table 8 presents the fuzzy range of objectives of the decision makers for three α cut levels on the basis of the outcomes of gmcr ii as stated in table 8 for each decision maker the lower bound of the objective functions in α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 have the maximum and minimum values respectively also the variation trend of the maximum values related to the different objective functions decreases when the confidence level increases from a α cut level of 0 to 1 after using gmcr ii to reach the optimal consensus solution on the pareto front curves among the three decision makers fuzzy objective functions are obtained regarding the preferences of the decision makers fuzzy membership functions of the different objective functions are presented in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that variations of these fuzzy objective functions in particular intervals for each α cut level can be distinguished from the left and right fuzzy sides of the diagram fig 9a shows that the fuzzy optimal values for the overall cost of the project objective function of moe at a α cut level of 0 changes between 143364 32 and 212443 71 by increasing the value of the α cut level from 0 to 1 in fig 9a variations in the optimal values for the overall cost of the project in the fuzzy right side of the diagram is lower than that in the fuzzy left side in fig 9b the fuzzy interval related to the sum of contaminant concentration in α cut 0 varies between 5 93 mg l and 46 6 mg l considering the fuzzy intervals of different objective functions in fig 9a 9b and 9c it can be seen that for different fuzzy α cut levels the values of fuzzy membership functions of contaminant plume fragmentation fig 9c are symmetric decision variables related to the compromise point on the pareto front curves are also taken into consideration the maximum and minimum values of decision variables of the fuzzy multi objective optimization model of bioremediation are presented in tables 9 11 for fuzzy α cut levels as can be seen tables 9 and 10 show the fuzzy ranges of injection and extraction discharges for a three year assessment duration for three α cut levels from 0 to 1 for three injection and two extraction wells respectively in table 11 extremum values of the location of these wells are provided for fuzzy α cut levels in the form of vertical and horizontal coordinates as the last decision variable fuzzy ranges of injecting oxygen though three injection wells for three fuzzy α cut levels from 0 to 1 are indicated in fig 10 for three years of monitoring the in situ bioremediation process it can be seen from fig 10 that for all bounds related to the values of injecting oxygen in different α cut levels from 0 to 1 an increasig trend is observed in the first year of assessment number 1 2 and 3 in the second year of monitoring the bioremediation process number 4 5 and 6 the trend of each bound values of injecting oxygen apart from the values of α cut level 1 e decreases the minimum value of all α cut levels occurs in the second year of assessment number 4 5 and 6 except the lower bound of α cut 0 for which the minimum value exists in the third year of assessing the bioremediation process number 9 4 summary and conclusions in this study a fuzzy optimization model was developed for the bioremediation of groundwater using general ftm three decision makers were involved in the bioremediation management system with conflicting strategies general ftm was used to consider two uncertain parameters i e hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants in the multi objective optimization model to achieve more dependable outcomes the range of variations in the mentioned uncertain parameters was 50 on the basis of trial and error and the opinions of experts following this pareto optimal solutions among the three decision makers objective functions were obtained from the fuzzy multi objective optimization model and then gmcr ii was utilized to obtain the best consensus optimal alternative for the trade off curves the bjective functions and their corresponding decision variables were calculated through fuzzy ranges results show that the minimum fuzzy interval was 32 5 and pertains to the overall cost of the bioremediation system at fuzzy α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 conversely the maximum fuzzy interval of 95 1 was related to contaminant plume fragmentation at fuzzy α cut levels of 0 and 0 5 for future studies in order to reduce the run time of the simulation optimization model a meta model could be used on the basis of repeated execution of a validated simulation model such as bioplume iii in addition inherent uncertainties in the model parameters in the present study were considered as fuzzy parameters however some of the input parameters of the model were interval number uncertainties hence developing a hybrid model that takes into account both fuzzy and interval uncertainties could be a useful approach in which a nonlinear interval number
