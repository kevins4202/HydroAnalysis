20710,the deficiencies of massive data like storage difficulty computation inefficiency and information redundancy call for ship trajectory compression while most studies on ship trajectory compression have one or more of the following drawbacks the drawback of low compression efficiency the problem resulted from error ship static information when the distance threshold is set based on ship length or width poor compression quality for some trajectories which is caused by experience based optimal threshold to solve these problems we propose the adp adaptive threshold douglas peucker algorithm based on dp douglas peucker algorithm by determining the key points of each trajectory through the threshold change rate adp no longer relies on ship static information and makes it easier to determine the threshold which is what traditional algorithms cannot achieve additionally we use the advantage of matrix operation and the method of reducing points to improve the algorithm s computation efficiency to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed algorithm we compared our algorithm with dp algorithm partition dp algorithm and sliding window algorithm from four aspects namely compression rate synchronous euclidean distance length loss rate and running time the experimental results prove that our algorithm has advantages over the other three algorithms especially in threshold setting keywords trajectory compression ship trajectory dp algorithm adp algorithm ais 1 introduction according to the solas international convention on the safety of life at sea convention more and more ships are required to install automatic identification system ais equipment to avoid ship collisions mou j m 2010 a large amount of ais data has been generated due to the widespread use of ais equipment and frequent transmission of ais data the massive ais trajectory data has inspired many studies such as studies on the improvement of ship navigation safety liu et al 2019b nieh c y 2019 maritime traffic efficiency kim k i 2018 liang s 2019 behavior pattern recognition zhou y 2019 zhang et al 2018 and researches on the impact of ships on marine ecology ebdon 2020 cominelli 2020 the transmission time interval of an ais message is about 3 10s which is much more frequent than the actual changes of ship speed position and course zhao 2018 consequently there will be some redundant information in the raw ais data zhao 2018 zhang 2020 therefore it is necessary to compress ais data in addition to reducing the redundant information in raw ais data trajectory compression has other important applications some researchers use trajectory compression to extract trajectory s key feature wen 2020 rong 2020 some use trajectory compression to improve computation efficiency kontopoulos 2020 zhao 2019 de vries 2012 trajectory compression plays an important role in ship routing zhang 2018 trajectory prediction last et al 2019 abnormal ship detection fu 2017 etc therefore it is essential to compress redundant information to reduce the storage and calculation costs in data processing and to further facilitate the study on ship trajectories features trajectory compression is a well studied topic in spatial database community trajectory compression algorithms can be divided into batched compression algorithms and online compression algorithms commonly used batched compression algorithms are douglas peucker algorithm douglas d h peucker t k 1973 and td tr algorithm meratnia 2004 widely used online compression algorithms are sliding window keogh 2001 opw tr meratnia 2004 bqs liu 2015 squish muckell 2011 and its improved algorithm squish e muckell 2014 normally the termination conditions of compression algorithms are as follows the number or proportion of the retained points exceeds a user defined value the maximum distance ed or sed of all trajectory points is below a user defined threshold retain the points of which the distance ed or sed is greater than or equal to a user defined threshold until all points are traversed maximum sed error is greater than or equal to a user defined threshold in trajectory compression the most difficult problem is to determine an appropriate user defined threshold because the threshold setting of trajectory compression is different for different waters and trajectories zhao 2018 if an algorithm s termination condition is a single compression rate or a certain number of compressed trajectory points its compression may be unsatisfactory when there are too many or too few trajectory points for example for a trajectory with a large number of trajectory points a high compression rate can often ensure a good compression as shown by ship no 4 in fig 14 but for a trajectory with a small number of trajectory points getting an ideal compression normally needs a low compression rate as shown by ship no 3 in fig 14 identically the use of a single user defined threshold also has similar problems there have been many studies on the threshold setting of compression algorithms zhang et al 2015 selected different thresholds for multiple experiments based on the dp algorithm they concluded that the upper limit of the threshold value for single ship trajectory compression was 16m but the value can be enlarged for observing the macroscopic traffic flow characteristics gao et al 2018 first set the distance threshold as 30 300 m the angle threshold of leeway and drift as 1 20 after that they chose different thresholds for multiple experiments and finally determined that the angle threshold is 9 according to the catastrophe step theory additionally distance thresholds of high medium and low levels were given which were 43 38 and 33 of the ship length respectively to achieve a balance between the simplification and visualization of ais ship trajectory li et al 2016 conducted many experiments to select a suitable threshold zhao et al 2018 also determined the threshold based on the ship length which was normally one ship length or 0 5 times the ship length pietrzykowski et al 2009 proposed the method of utilizing domain to keep navigation safety many researchers have conducted multiple studies in ship domain coldwell t g 1983 fujii y 1984 zhao et al 1993 lisowski j 2000 szlapczynski 2006 wang 2010 zhang et al 2016 determined suitable threshold based on determining the maximum value that can ensure the track points of simplified trajectory are within the safe range of the corresponding original track points this method regarded the ship domain of sailing ship as the threshold which was 0 8 times the ship length gao et al 2019 combined the sliding window algorithm ship navigation angle deviation position deviation and spatio temporal characteristics of ais to determine key feature points regarding the multiples of ship width as the distance threshold they concluded that the optimal distance threshold was 0 731 1 274 times the ship width and the threshold of navigation angle deviation was 3 8 5 wei et al 2020 proposed an ais trajectory simplification algorithm combining dp algorithm and sliding window algorithm the threshold of the dp algorithm is set to 0 8 times the ship length and the threshold coefficient of the sliding window algorithm is set to 1 6 liu et al 2019a proposed the method that extracted and retained key feature points according to channel characteristics trajectory characteristics segmented frame and average distance which was obviously constrained by channel characteristics to sum up there are mainly two threshold setting methods which are empirical threshold and multiples of the ship length or width however the empirical threshold is often limited by water areas thus it is difficult to determine the threshold for water areas outside researchers testing scope as for the threshold that is set based on ship length or width the distance threshold will have errors under the influence of a large quantity of abnormal ais static information as illustrated in table 4 we insist that this is a serious problem because a result calculated on a problematic basis is definitely unreliable unfortunately the threshold setting of many current ship trajectory compression algorithms is related to ship static information to overcome the algorithms deficiencies in threshold setting threshold setting is based on experience or ship static information there is an urgent need for a novel ship trajectory compression algorithm of which the threshold setting is not based on experience or static ship information accordingly in this study we propose the adaptive threshold douglas peucker adp algorithm on the basis of the douglas peucker dp algorithm the main contributions of the proposed algorithm are as follows firstly the proposed algorithm solves the problem resulted by the experience based threshold that some algorithms applications are limited by waters and can only well compress a part of trajectories secondly it solves the problem of poor or even unsuccessful compression due to incorrect ship static information in some trajectory compression algorithms additionally we use the advantage of matrix operation and the method of reducing points to improve the algorithm s computation efficiency the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the classic dp algorithm as well as the principle and implementation of adp algorithm in section 3 we compare and analyze the compression results of the adp algorithm and other three commonly used algorithms from the aspects of compression rate synchronous euclidean distance sed length loss rate llr and running time in section 4 we illustrate the feasibility and superiority of the adp algorithm when compared to the other three algorithms and the conclusions and our future research directions are discussed in section 5 2 methods 2 1 preprocessing massive ais data has rich research value but it also has many errors such as static information errors speed errors position errors and data missing this paper refers to the method provided by cheng 2019 yan 2020 zhao 2018 to clean ais data in order to compute the distance from the point to the baseline the adp algorithm transforms the geographic coordinates into the coordinates in mercator projection zhao 2018 miao gao 2019 let the longitude and latitude coordinates of the unconverted track point be λ ϕ and the coordinates converted to mercator projection be x y then 1 x r 0 λ 2 y r 0 q where r 0 denotes the radius of the parallel circle of standard latitude and q represents the equidistant latitude 3 r 0 a cos ϕ 0 1 e 2 s i n 2 ϕ 0 4 q ln tan π 4 ϕ 2 1 e s i n ϕ 1 e s i n ϕ e 2 ϕ 0 denotes the standard latitude in mercator projection a

used algorithm for trajectory compression its main idea is to extract from the original track set t s the key feature point set k s k 1 k j k t which should be as similar as possible to the former under a certain threshold ε where t is the number of compressed track points and k j a j b j the implementation of the dp algorithm see fig 1 is as follows step 1 put the initial and the end point of set t s into set k s step 2 traverse set k s step 2 1 assuming the line between two adjacent points k j and k j 1 as the baseline the segment between the two points as the sub track segment s u b t t 1 t i t m where m is the number of sub track points t i x i y i compute the distance from the points in the sub track segment s u b t to the baseline step 2 2 take the maximum distance d m a x if d m a x ε take the point t i corresponding to the maximum distance and store it in set k s step3 assume the maximum value among all the d m a x be d m a x if d m a x ε repeat step 2 otherwise end the loop 2 3 adp algorithm zhao et al 2019 introduced trajectory shape change rate for calculating trajectory length reduction for a range with a high trajectory shape change rate the trajectories had been compressed significantly and the range was named change phase for a range that the change rate fell below a certain value the trajectory remained relatively stable and the range was referred to as stable phase based on the above idea we introduce the concept of threshold change rate in this paper 2 3 1 related definitions 2 3 1 1 definition 1 compression rate compression rate is the ratio of the number of discarded trajectory points to the original number of trajectory points the compression rate of a single trajectory denoted as scr is 5 scr m n where n is the total number of track points and m is the number of discarded track points the average compression rate acr of all trajectories is 6 acr m n where n represents the number of track points of all trajectories and m denotes the total number of discarded points the compression rate in this paper refers to scr unless otherwise specified 2 3 1 2 definition 2 synchronous euclidean distance sed sed is commonly used to measure compression effectiveness let p i x i y i t i be a point in the original trajectory t s p j x j y j t j and p j 1 x j 1 y j 1 t j 1 be the points in the compressed trajectory t s that are located before and after p i t j t i t j 1 in chronological order then 7 x i x j t i t j t j 1 t j x j 1 x j y i y j t i t j t j 1 t j y j 1 y j s e d i x i x i 2 y i y i 2 the average sed of a single trajectory is denoted as s a s e d then 8 s a s e d 1 n i 1 n s e d i the average sed of all trajectories is denoted as a a s e d then 9 a a s e d 1 n i 1 n s a s e d i where n is the number of track points of the original trajectory t s n represents the total number of ship trajectories definition 3 length loss rate llr llr is the ratio of the difference between the original track length and the compressed track length to the original track length 10 llr i 1 i j 1 j 1 p j p j 1 i 1 i j 1 j 1 p j p j 1 i 1 i j 1 j 1 p j p j 1 i denotes the number of ship trajectories j represents the number of original track points of each ship p j p j 1 is the distance between two adjacent points of the original trajectory and j is the number of compressed track points of each ship p j p j 1 is the distance between two adjacent points of the compressed trajectory definition 4 critical threshold of point ξ t s is the set of trajectory points a t s if a distance threshold just makes trajectory point a a key point after compression the threshold is called the critical threshold of point a recorded as ξ 2 3 1 3 definition 5 threshold change rate k after compression there will be a ξ for each trajectory and each trajectory will be divided into two sub trajectories as shown in fig 4 and table 1 where the p th compression represents the compression at which the p th critical threshold ξ is obtained let the set of critical thresholds of all points in a trajectory is m ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ p ξ n ξ p is the critical threshold of the p th compression n is the number of critical thresholds and the step between two adjacent ξ is one then the critical threshold change rate of the p th critical threshold is 11 k p ξ p ξ p 1 p n 1 p 1 0 p n 2 3 1 4 definition 6 optimal threshold change rate k o when k p k o k p i i 1 2 p 1 the trajectory consisting of points corresponding to the critical threshold ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ p 1 those points are called as key points kpt can maintain a high similarity with the original trajectory under keeping a high compression rate k o is the optimal threshold change rate the value taking of k 0 will be introduced in detail in section 2 4 2 3 2 running time optimization compared with online compression algorithms offline compression algorithms have the advantage of global optimum but many offline compression algorithms are time consuming to conquer the problem zhao et al 2018 adopted the method of detecting transition points they used the transition points to divide the trajectory into straight and curve part based on their different properties after that they compressed the two parts separately by the dp algorithm thereby reducing the compression time however this method diminishes the advantage of the global optimum of the dp algorithm besides it has its limitations for some ship trajectories such as ship no 4 in table 9 in our algorithm we use matrix operation to calculate the maximum distance from point to line let the sub trajectory segment of the maximum distance be calculated be s u b t t 1 t i t m t i x i y i the linear equation with the line connecting the beginning and end points t 1 and t m as the baseline is a x b y c 0 then 12 d 1 d i d m x 1 y 1 x i x m y i y m a b then the maximum distance from the point in s u b t to the baseline is 13 d 1 m i n d 1 d i d m d 2 m a x d 1 d i d m d m a x m a x d 1 c a 2 b 2 d 2 c a 2 b 2 moreover we have a new method for time optimization that is to reduce the number of points to be calculated let an original trajectory be ts the method is as follows a filter out the points in ts of which the course change difference is less than δ θ and restore the remaining points into the set of turning points cs when the number of points between two turning points is larger than δ n δ n is generally 10 30 insert several points so that the number of points between the two turning points is less than δ n as the red points in fig 2 a have shown b figure out the point in cs with the largest distance from the baseline and denoted it as p as shown in fig 2 b c calculate the distance from the points around p to the baseline and find out the maximum value the maximum value is the maximum distance from the point of the original trajectory ts to the baseline as shown in fig 2 c fig 3 shows the relation between filtration rate and δ θ filtration rate is the ratio of the number of filtered trajectory points to the original number of trajectory points when δ θ 3 the filtration rate is 87 68 a a s e d 71 9 m when δ θ 10 the filtration rate is 94 00 a a s e d 110 7 m when δ θ 10 the change of filtration rate is insignificant by the method of filtering out the non turning points the computation efficiency can be greatly improved especially when the number of points is large however the method requires two calculations to find the maximum value of the sub trajectory which in practical applications may be affected by unstable operating environment and reduces the computation efficiency therefore we recommend that this method only be used when the number of points in the sub trajectory is above 500 points as shown by line20 line30 in algorithm 2 for the filtration of non turning points see algorithm 1 algorithm 1 filtration of non turning points input trajectory points set t s δ θ δ n output set of turning points c s 1 function c a l c u t p t s δ θ δ n 2 s 0 e s 1 c

represents the initial input compressed trajectory c s is the set of turning points in t s after compression the kpt the critical threshold ξ p calculated by the method in 2 3 2 similarly hereinafter corresponding to the key points and the sub trajectory segment s t p q s t p q q n a n d q 2 represents the q th sub trajectory segment obtained by the p th compression will be obtained and the critical threshold ξ p q corresponding to the key points k p t p q in s t p q will be calculated s e t s t k s and s e t ξ represent the set of sub trajectory segment s t p q key points kpt and the critical threshold ξ p corresponding to kpt after compression respectively if k p k o ξ p d i s l i m i t d i s l i m i t represents the lower limit of ξ p its value is explained in section 2 4 are satisfied then take s t max ξ that corresponds to the maximum ξ p in s e t s t as the next compressed trajectory segment to be input and delete s t max ξ in s e t s t otherwise the loop ends assuming that both k o and d i s l i m i t are zero then the ts compression process in fig 4 b will be shown in the following table 1 fig 4 c shows the change of ξ of each point in ts 2 3 4 adaptive threshold a good trajectory compression algorithm can reduce distortion as much as possible while keeping a high compression rate normally the larger the threshold value the higher the compression rate and the severer the distortion thus it is not easy to determine an appropriate threshold that can help to achieve a balance between the compression rate and distortion generally the ξ of most key points should be larger than that of most non key points in a trajectory when speed changes are not taken into consideration as shown in fig 1 the ξ of point t 4 is much larger than that of other points and the ξ of point t 9 is much larger than that of points other than point t 4 fig 6 represents the change of the ξ of each track point in the randomly selected 200 ship trajectories arranged in chronological order of the ξ obtained by each compression the ordinate represents the value of the ξ and the abscissa represents the order that ξ is obtained fig 5 is the original trajectory of the 200 trajectories in fig 6 as area 1 and area 2 in fig 6 have shown for the points before area 2 the ξ are large and decrease rapidly while for the points after area 2 the ξ are small and decrease slowly in section 2 4 we introduce in detail how to determine the adaptive distance threshold of each trajectory by the change characteristics of the ξ of all points 2 4 distance threshold determination 2 4 1 critical threshold fitting it can be seen from fig 6 that the change trend of the ξ of all track points in the trajectories is similar and the trend is the same with the change trend of function y k x k 0 thus in this study we use the leastsq of scipy optimize in python to fit the discrete critical thresholds given the poor flexibility of y k x we assumed our fitting curve equation be 14 y a d x b c formula 14 is a fitting curve function that y varies with x according to the assumption in fig 6 where a b c and d are parameters of the fitting function the larger a is the flatter the curve will be the larger d and c are the more convex the curve will be b indicates that the curve is translated to the left by b units d and c have a greater influence on the degree of convexity of the curve than a the goodness of fit r 2 of the three fitted curves in fig 7 can be calculated by formula 15 r 2 a l l is 0 53 r 2 t 0 is 0 70 r 2 t 17 is 0 91 although the critical thresholds of the 200 trajectories show the same change trend the flatness of each curve varies some even vary greatly therefore the goodness of fit r 2 of the fitted curve for all trajectories is relatively small but still acceptable from the fitting results of fig 7 it can be seen that the fitting curve equation we assumed is justifiable 15 r 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i is the true value its mean value is y and the fitted value is y ˆ i the following equation 16 is a fitted curve equation obtained using the leastsq of scipy optimize in python it can be obtained that a 321 32 b 0 03 c 1 22 d 0 11 16 y 321 32 0 11 x 0 03 1 22 the curve change of equation 16 is shown in fig 8 among the 200 randomly selected trajectories the most obviously downward convex one is t 17 the least obviously downward convex one is t 0 thus we also fitted the fitted curves of the critical thresholds of these two trajectories the fitting results are shown in fig 7 in section 2 4 2 we use the fitted curve to calculate the optimal threshold change rate k o mentioned in definition 5 2 4 2 calculation of optimal threshold change rate k o 2 4 2 1 definition 7 angle change rate r angle change rate refers to the change rate in the tangent direction between two adjacent points in the fitted curve which is calculated by formula 18 as shown in figs 6 and 7 the line in area 3 is vertical although the critical thresholds change rapidly their direction changes little the line in area 4 is horizontal the critical threshold changes a little and the direction is almost unchanged the change from vertical to horizontal direction mainly occurs in area 1 therefore in this paper we calculate the optimal threshold change rate according to the angle change rate between two adjacent points in the fitted curve in other words the threshold change rate corresponding to the point with the maximum angle change rate is the optimal threshold change rate k o take derivative of equation 14 it can be obtained that 17 y a c d d x b c 1 thus the angle change rate between the p th point and the p 1 th point is 18 r p tan 1 y p tan 1 y p 1 the angle change rate of the curve in fig 8 can be obtained by formulas 17 and 18 according to the change of the angle change rate of the curve as shown in fig 9 when x 38 there will be a theoretically optimal threshold change rate which is k o a l l 1 68 similarly the theoretically optimal threshold change rate of t 0 is k o 0 1 71 w h e n x 124 the theoretically optimal threshold change rate of t 17 is k o 17 1 36 w h e n x 25 to ensure that the theoretically optimal threshold change rates of all ship trajectories are greater than k o set in algorithm we set k o m i n k o a l l k o 0 k o 17 in the proposed algorithm in some cases such as observing the state of ship traffic flow in the whole water a high compression rate is needed but in other cases such as studying the motion situation of a single ship high accuracy of compression is required zhang 2015 therefore to meet the needs of different accuracies of compressed trajectory in different applications we introduce the compression control parameter μ the default value is 0 5 under the condition of adaptive threshold 19 k o 1 36 μ 1 μ 0 μ 1 it can be seen from fig 10 and table 2 using formula 11 to calculate k p the compression results is not ideal of which the reason is as follows when calculating k p according to formula 11 the occurrence of abnormal conditions will cause that ξ p is equal or nearly equal to ξ p 1 which will result in the calculated k p is smaller than k o consequently the compression will end up compared with the fitting curve the change of the ξ is not very smooth and there are even some fluctuations when a ship turns back and forth in a water area there will be some key thresholds that are similar or even the same resulting in an error between the change rate of actually optimal threshold and the theoretically optimal threshold as shown in t 0 in fig 7 thus to avoid the aforementioned problems we use formula 20 instead of formula 11 to calculate the threshold change rate k p of the p th critical threshold 20 k p ξ p max d i s s e t o r l e n d i s s e t 3 max max d i s s e t ξ p ξ p min d i s s e t o t h e r s where d i s s e t is the subset ξ p l ξ p 1 of m ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ p ξ n ξ p is the value of the p th critical threshold and ξ p 3 the p 3 th μ is compression control parameter the default value is 0 5 in formula 20 max max d i s s e t ξ p ξ p min d i s s e t may be slightly larger than ξ p ξ p 1 or ξ p 1 ξ p which will bring about the increase of few key points but it avoids the result caused by formula 11 fig 11 and table 3 are the compression result when k p of the p th critical threshold is calculated by formula 20 and it can be seen that it is more reasonable to compute k p by formula 20 when the parameter μ is small some redundant points will be retained in the compression process to avoid such situation we introduced the distance limit value d i s l i m i t under the condition of adaptive threshold that is the points with distance that is smaller than d i s l i m i t will be discarded and the value of d i s l i m i t is 0 10 21 d i s l i m i t 10 e x p log 10 μ when μ 0 5 d i s l i m i t 7 4 for the implementation of the algorithm see algorithm 2 line 7 to 16 in algorithm 2 is to examine whether the track points are key points or not for the traditional dp algorithm when the maximum distance of the calculated track segment exceeds the distance threshold the corresponding segment will be divided into two sub segments then the computation will be repeated until the algorithm fails to meet the setting condition while adp algorithm adopts the method of selecting the maximum ξ of all the sub track segments to examine critical points as illustrated in line 8 to 9 algorithm 2 trajectory compression input original track points set t s μ the default value is 0 5 k o 1 36 μ 1 μ d i s l i m i t

algorithm with the traditional dp algorithm the improved compression algorithm based on dp algorithm partition dp herein proposed by zhao et al 2018 and the improved compression algorithm based on sliding window sliding window herein proposed by gao et al 2019 the algorithms were compared mainly from four aspects namely compression rate formula 5 6 sed formula 7 9 llr formula 10 and running time of data compressing the trajectory data of the estuary of yangtze river from june 1 2017 to june 3 2017 were used for testing the data contains ais trajectories of 2775 ships with 3103471 track points the points with wrong ship position have been removed including 1814892 track points with error static information the length or width of the ship is less than 1m the ratio of length to width is greater than 10 or less than 4 the total length of trajectories of all ships is 227988572 69m and the information is given in table 4 the algorithm was implemented on the computer windows 64bit with eight cores intel r core tm i7 7700hq cpu 2 80 ghz 2 81 ghz and 24 gb of ram using python3 7 3 2 introduction to the algorithms used for comparison partition dp algorithm zhao 2018 according to partition dp algorithm a ship trajectory is divided into straight part and curve part and they exhibit different properties the straight part as the main part of ship trajectory is lengthy and easily compressed while the curve part is laconic and has more shapes when compressing ship trajectory the traditional dp algorithm does not distinguish between the two parts causing the track points of straight part being repeatedly calculated which means that most calculations are unnecessary zhao et al attached great importance to the transition points between straight and curve part they held that the transition points should be kept no matter how high the compression rate or how small the turning radius is partition dp algorithm mainly identifies the transition points based on the change of the ship course the algorithm is mainly divided into two steps that is segmentation and compression based on dp algorithm in the first step the algorithm calculates the course difference δ c between each track point and the fifth track point and compares the values of δ c between two adjacent points if the values of δ c of the two track points are greater than 10 and less than 10 respectively the aforementioned track points will be termed as transition points according to these transition points the trajectory will be divided into several sub trajectories for the second step each sub trajectory will be compressed by the traditional dp algorithm and the threshold is 0 5 times to 1 time the ship length the appropriate proportion for waters near islands is usually 0 1 to 10 times the ship length sliding window algorithm gao 2019 gao et al 2019 combined the sliding window algorithm ship navigation angle deviation position deviation and ais spatio temporal characteristics to determine kfp key feature point according to the ship domain model proposed by fujii 1971 the long axis of ship domain is 8 times the ship length and the short axis is 3 2 times the ship length in this compression algorithm the distance threshold is regarded as 0 2 5 times the ship width the threshold of the ship navigation angle deviation is 0 12 by referring to the diagram of the redundant information rejection ratio the obtained optimal distance threshold is 0 731 1 274 times the ship width and the threshold of the ship navigation angle deviation is 3 8 5 as summarized in table 5 trajectory compression algorithms have different characteristics in terms of their guarantees on compression and time complexity their advantages and disadvantages will be further illustrated in section 3 3 and section 4 3 3 test results in this study our comparison is based on the optimal threshold of each algorithm the threshold of adp algorithm is μ 0 5 the authors of the other three algorithms didn t mention about parameter setting under different water areas therefore we can only refer to the research results of academics with expertise in this field coldwell t g 1983 fujii y 1984 zhao j s 1993 lisowski j 2000 szlapczynski 2006 wang 2010 zhang 2016 sánchez heres 2019 and take the median of the parameter range they proposed as the threshold of the algorithm the distance threshold of partition dp and dp is 0 8 times the ship length the distance threshold of sliding window is the ship width and the navigation angle deviation threshold is 4 5 the test results are shown in table 6 the four algorithms have different acr under their respective optimal threshold dp has the highest acr but its llr and aased are the largest besides it has the lowest computation efficiency partition dp s acr is similar to dp s and it also has large llr and aased but partition dp has the highest computation efficiency adp algorithm also has a high acr and its llr and aased are small the aased of adp is smaller than that of the sliding window which has an acr of 89 16 moreover adp has a high computation efficiency sliding window has the lowest acr and llr and it also has a high computation efficiency however the aased of sliding window is larger than of adp which has an acr of 96 63 we also compared the compression of the four algorithms under the same acr as shown in table 7 and fig 12 sliding window has time saving advantage since the algorithm first calculates the navigation angle and distance deviation its compression time is not affected by acr that is the running time of the algorithm will rarely increase as acr reduces in addition the algorithm can always keep time consumption low when acr is greater than 98 89 the partition dp algorithm is the most efficient when acr is less than 96 02 adp has a high computation efficiency which ranks only second to sliding window dp is the one has the lowest computation efficiency sliding window has the highest computation efficiency but it has the largest llr and aased in other words sliding window has the lowest compression quality under the same acr with other three algorithms among the other three algorithms when acr is above 86 35 adp has the lowest llr and aased followed by dp compared with dp and adp partition dp has both larger llr and aased in other words when acr is high adp has the highest compression quality followed by dp and the compression quality of partition dp is relatively low when acr is very high adp shows obvious advantages compared to the other three algorithms when the compression rate is low the compression quality of all the algorithms is satisfactory except for sliding window and there is no big difference in the values of llr and aased among them fig 13 shows the running time of the four algorithms for single ship trajectory compression due to that the compression rates of the same trajectory of the four algorithms are different fig 13 cannot be to evaluate the algorithms operational efficiency but it can be seen from fig 13 that the efficiency of the adp algorithm and the sliding window algorithm are relatively stable while for the traditional dp algorithm and partition dp algorithm exception occurred when they are compressing some trajectories the exception occurred mainly due to the error information of ship length which is 0m it can be seen from table 4 that in the ais ship trajectory information half of the static information of track points is wrong 4 discussion in order to further validate the feasibility and superiority of the adp algorithm we randomly selected four trajectories from the 2775 trajectories to conduct test analysis information of trajectories is given in table 8 from table 8 we can see that some ships have abnormal static information for example the length of the ship with maritime mobile service identify mmsi number of 357063000 is 417m but the width of the ship is only 5m and the length and width of the ship with mmsi number of 412435750 are both 0m since the threshold of trajectory compression is determined based on the length and width of ships the ship information errors will inevitably reduce the reliability of trajectory compression in this study our comparison is based on the optimal threshold of each algorithm the threshold of adp algorithm is μ 0 5 the distance threshold of partition dp and dp is 0 8 times the ship length the distance threshold of sliding window is the ship width and its navigation angle deviation threshold is 4 5 comparison results are shown in table 9 and fig 14 for ship no 1 due to the incorrect static information the distance thresholds of partition dp algorithm and dp algorithm are high resulting in many key track points being lost as shown in areas a and b in fig 14 we suggest that for ship no 1 the distance threshold of partition dp algorithm and dp algorithm be 0 08 0 2 times of ship length rather than the recommended 0 8 times of ship length for sliding window due to that it saves more turning points which account for 79 76 of all key points its scr is low though sliding window has a lower llr than adp of which the scr is 98 19 its sased is much larger than adp s compared to the other three algorithms adp algorithm can maintain a low llr 0 070 and a small sased 47 91m while maintaining a high scr 98 19 it can be seen from fig 14 that although the adp algorithm does not consider the ship s course it retains enough turning points for ship no 2 dp algorithm partition dp algorithm and sliding window all fail to compress the data due to the error of ship static information the length and width of the ship are both 0m however adp algorithm is not affected by the error and could still compress data normally and at the same time it maintains a high scr as well as low llr and sased different from the other three test ships ship no 3 has smaller sailing waters and fewer track points when compressing the trajectory of ship no 3 partition dp algorithm and dp algorithm completely lost the ship s original trajectory shape therefore we suggest that for ship no 3 the distance threshold of partition dp algorithm and dp algorithm be 0 03 0 07 times of ship length rather than the recommended 0 8 times of ship length sliding window has the lowest llr and sased but its scr is the lowest which is because it retains many turning points showing the defect of sliding window as can be seen from the c area in fig 14 where sliding window missed some key points because it is sensitive for sliding window to detect the change of angle but difficult to detect the change of distance when the distance threshold is 0 09 0 2 times of the ship width it can detect missed key points when the distance threshold is 0 09 times the ship width and the angle threshold is 9 its scr is 48 0 llr is 0 428 and sased is 5 23m and this compression result is better than the result under the threshold recommended by sliding window compared to these algorithms our algorithm can have a high scr at keeping a low llr and sased for ship no 4 the scr of sliding window algorithm is low due to the varieties of ship s course especially when the 99 95 of key feature points are turning points certainly it also has the lowest llr and sased for partition dp algorithm it divides the trajectory into 138 segments with 141 key feature points and 139 segmentation points resulting in its lower scr and higher llr when compared to adp algorithm but the difference between its sased and adp s is very small it can be concluded from the comparison that though the researchers of dp partition dp and sliding window have provided recommended thresholds those thresholds fail to bring about satisfactory compression for some ships when waters change when there are errors in ship static information the compression of algorithms with thresholds that are based on ship length or width will be greatly affected adp uses threshold change rate as the termination condition which is irrelevant to waters and ais static information therefore adp does not have the above two problems showing the feasibility and superiority of the adp algorithm 5 conclusion in this paper the adp algorithm on the basis of dp algorithm was developed and tested the experiment demonstrate that compared with the traditional dp algorithm adp algorithm has made great progress on running time due to that the distance thresholds of the three algorithms are related to the ship length or width their compression will be affected by the error ship static information which will result in poor compression as ship no 1 in fig 14 has shown unsuccessful compression as the ship no 2 in fig 14 has shown or compression being affected by the vary of waters as the ship no 3 in fig 14 has shown however the adp algorithm has no these problems because its distance threshold is not determined by the ship s static information but by the change characteristics of the critical threshold of each track point therefore the adp algorithm can not only compress the trajectories of inland ships but also the trajectories of ships at sea nevertheless adp algorithm has its deficiencies for ships with constantly circling movement the compression of the adp algorithm is not very satisfactory as shown by t0 in fig 11 besides it does not take account of ship s course and speed although sliding window algorithm takes ship s course into consideration it only retains track point on the condition that the navigation deviation is greater than a certain value as a result it is difficult to have a high compression rate and at the same time ensuring low distortion to solve the problem we will consider the role of ship course and speed in a better way in our future study

20710,the deficiencies of massive data like storage difficulty computation inefficiency and information redundancy call for ship trajectory compression while most studies on ship trajectory compression have one or more of the following drawbacks the drawback of low compression efficiency the problem resulted from error ship static information when the distance threshold is set based on ship length or width poor compression quality for some trajectories which is caused by experience based optimal threshold to solve these problems we propose the adp adaptive threshold douglas peucker algorithm based on dp douglas peucker algorithm by determining the key points of each trajectory through the threshold change rate adp no longer relies on ship static information and makes it easier to determine the threshold which is what traditional algorithms cannot achieve additionally we use the advantage of matrix operation and the method of reducing points to improve the algorithm s computation efficiency to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed algorithm we compared our algorithm with dp algorithm partition dp algorithm and sliding window algorithm from four aspects namely compression rate synchronous euclidean distance length loss rate and running time the experimental results prove that our algorithm has advantages over the other three algorithms especially in threshold setting keywords trajectory compression ship trajectory dp algorithm adp algorithm ais 1 introduction according to the solas international convention on the safety of life at sea convention more and more ships are required to install automatic identification system ais equipment to avoid ship collisions mou j m 2010 a large amount of ais data has been generated due to the widespread use of ais equipment and frequent transmission of ais data the massive ais trajectory data has inspired many studies such as studies on the improvement of ship navigation safety liu et al 2019b nieh c y 2019 maritime traffic efficiency kim k i 2018 liang s 2019 behavior pattern recognition zhou y 2019 zhang et al 2018 and researches on the impact of ships on marine ecology ebdon 2020 cominelli 2020 the transmission time interval of an ais message is about 3 10s which is much more frequent than the actual changes of ship speed position and course zhao 2018 consequently there will be some redundant information in the raw ais data zhao 2018 zhang 2020 therefore it is necessary to compress ais data in addition to reducing the redundant information in raw ais data trajectory compression has other important applications some researchers use trajectory compression to extract trajectory s key feature wen 2020 rong 2020 some use trajectory compression to improve computation efficiency kontopoulos 2020 zhao 2019 de vries 2012 trajectory compression plays an important role in ship routing zhang 2018 trajectory prediction last et al 2019 abnormal ship detection fu 2017 etc therefore it is essential to compress redundant information to reduce the storage and calculation costs in data processing and to further facilitate the study on ship trajectories features trajectory compression is a well studied topic in spatial database community trajectory compression algorithms can be divided into batched compression algorithms and online compression algorithms commonly used batched compression algorithms are douglas peucker algorithm douglas d h peucker t k 1973 and td tr algorithm meratnia 2004 widely used online compression algorithms are sliding window keogh 2001 opw tr meratnia 2004 bqs liu 2015 squish muckell 2011 and its improved algorithm squish e muckell 2014 normally the termination conditions of compression algorithms are as follows the number or proportion of the retained points exceeds a user defined value the maximum distance ed or sed of all trajectory points is below a user defined threshold retain the points of which the distance ed or sed is greater than or equal to a user defined threshold until all points are traversed maximum sed error is greater than or equal to a user defined threshold in trajectory compression the most difficult problem is to determine an appropriate user defined threshold because the threshold setting of trajectory compression is different for different waters and trajectories zhao 2018 if an algorithm s termination condition is a single compression rate or a certain number of compressed trajectory points its compression may be unsatisfactory when there are too many or too few trajectory points for example for a trajectory with a large number of trajectory points a high compression rate can often ensure a good compression as shown by ship no 4 in fig 14 but for a trajectory with a small number of trajectory points getting an ideal compression normally needs a low compression rate as shown by ship no 3 in fig 14 identically the use of a single user defined threshold also has similar problems there have been many studies on the threshold setting of compression algorithms zhang et al 2015 selected different thresholds for multiple experiments based on the dp algorithm they concluded that the upper limit of the threshold value for single ship trajectory compression was 16m but the value can be enlarged for observing the macroscopic traffic flow characteristics gao et al 2018 first set the distance threshold as 30 300 m the angle threshold of leeway and drift as 1 20 after that they chose different thresholds for multiple experiments and finally determined that the angle threshold is 9 according to the catastrophe step theory additionally distance thresholds of high medium and low levels were given which were 43 38 and 33 of the ship length respectively to achieve a balance between the simplification and visualization of ais ship trajectory li et al 2016 conducted many experiments to select a suitable threshold zhao et al 2018 also determined the threshold based on the ship length which was normally one ship length or 0 5 times the ship length pietrzykowski et al 2009 proposed the method of utilizing domain to keep navigation safety many researchers have conducted multiple studies in ship domain coldwell t g 1983 fujii y 1984 zhao et al 1993 lisowski j 2000 szlapczynski 2006 wang 2010 zhang et al 2016 determined suitable threshold based on determining the maximum value that can ensure the track points of simplified trajectory are within the safe range of the corresponding original track points this method regarded the ship domain of sailing ship as the threshold which was 0 8 times the ship length gao et al 2019 combined the sliding window algorithm ship navigation angle deviation position deviation and spatio temporal characteristics of ais to determine key feature points regarding the multiples of ship width as the distance threshold they concluded that the optimal distance threshold was 0 731 1 274 times the ship width and the threshold of navigation angle deviation was 3 8 5 wei et al 2020 proposed an ais trajectory simplification algorithm combining dp algorithm and sliding window algorithm the threshold of the dp algorithm is set to 0 8 times the ship length and the threshold coefficient of the sliding window algorithm is set to 1 6 liu et al 2019a proposed the method that extracted and retained key feature points according to channel characteristics trajectory characteristics segmented frame and average distance which was obviously constrained by channel characteristics to sum up there are mainly two threshold setting methods which are empirical threshold and multiples of the ship length or width however the empirical threshold is often limited by water areas thus it is difficult to determine the threshold for water areas outside researchers testing scope as for the threshold that is set based on ship length or width the distance threshold will have errors under the influence of a large quantity of abnormal ais static information as illustrated in table 4 we insist that this is a serious problem because a result calculated on a problematic basis is definitely unreliable unfortunately the threshold setting of many current ship trajectory compression algorithms is related to ship static information to overcome the algorithms deficiencies in threshold setting threshold setting is based on experience or ship static information there is an urgent need for a novel ship trajectory compression algorithm of which the threshold setting is not based on experience or static ship information accordingly in this study we propose the adaptive threshold douglas peucker adp algorithm on the basis of the douglas peucker dp algorithm the main contributions of the proposed algorithm are as follows firstly the proposed algorithm solves the problem resulted by the experience based threshold that some algorithms applications are limited by waters and can only well compress a part of trajectories secondly it solves the problem of poor or even unsuccessful compression due to incorrect ship static information in some trajectory compression algorithms additionally we use the advantage of matrix operation and the method of reducing points to improve the algorithm s computation efficiency the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the classic dp algorithm as well as the principle and implementation of adp algorithm in section 3 we compare and analyze the compression results of the adp algorithm and other three commonly used algorithms from the aspects of compression rate synchronous euclidean distance sed length loss rate llr and running time in section 4 we illustrate the feasibility and superiority of the adp algorithm when compared to the other three algorithms and the conclusions and our future research directions are discussed in section 5 2 methods 2 1 preprocessing massive ais data has rich research value but it also has many errors such as static information errors speed errors position errors and data missing this paper refers to the method provided by cheng 2019 yan 2020 zhao 2018 to clean ais data in order to compute the distance from the point to the baseline the adp algorithm transforms the geographic coordinates into the coordinates in mercator projection zhao 2018 miao gao 2019 let the longitude and latitude coordinates of the unconverted track point be λ ϕ and the coordinates converted to mercator projection be x y then 1 x r 0 λ 2 y r 0 q where r 0 denotes the radius of the parallel circle of standard latitude and q represents the equidistant latitude 3 r 0 a cos ϕ 0 1 e 2 s i n 2 ϕ 0 4 q ln tan π 4 ϕ 2 1 e s i n ϕ 1 e s i n ϕ e 2 ϕ 0 denotes the standard latitude in mercator projection a represents the equatorial radius of earth ellipsoid e represents the first eccentricity of earth ellipsoid 2 2 classic dp algorithm the dp algorithm douglas d h peucker t k 1973 is the most widely used algorithm for trajectory compression its main idea is to extract from the original track set t s the key feature point set k s k 1 k j k t which should be as similar as possible to the former under a certain threshold ε where t is the number of compressed track points and k j a j b j the implementation of the dp algorithm see fig 1 is as follows step 1 put the initial and the end point of set t s into set k s step 2 traverse set k s step 2 1 assuming the line between two adjacent points k j and k j 1 as the baseline the segment between the two points as the sub track segment s u b t t 1 t i t m where m is the number of sub track points t i x i y i compute the distance from the points in the sub track segment s u b t to the baseline step 2 2 take the maximum distance d m a x if d m a x ε take the point t i corresponding to the maximum distance and store it in set k s step3 assume the maximum value among all the d m a x be d m a x if d m a x ε repeat step 2 otherwise end the loop 2 3 adp algorithm zhao et al 2019 introduced trajectory shape change rate for calculating trajectory length reduction for a range with a high trajectory shape change rate the trajectories had been compressed significantly and the range was named change phase for a range that the change rate fell below a certain value the trajectory remained relatively stable and the range was referred to as stable phase based on the above idea we introduce the concept of threshold change rate in this paper 2 3 1 related definitions 2 3 1 1 definition 1 compression rate compression rate is the ratio of the number of discarded trajectory points to the original number of trajectory points the compression rate of a single trajectory denoted as scr is 5 scr m n where n is the total number of track points and m is the number of discarded track points the average compression rate acr of all trajectories is 6 acr m n where n represents the number of track points of all trajectories and m denotes the total number of discarded points the compression rate in this paper refers to scr unless otherwise specified 2 3 1 2 definition 2 synchronous euclidean distance sed sed is commonly used to measure compression effectiveness let p i x i y i t i be a point in the original trajectory t s p j x j y j t j and p j 1 x j 1 y j 1 t j 1 be the points in the compressed trajectory t s that are located before and after p i t j t i t j 1 in chronological order then 7 x i x j t i t j t j 1 t j x j 1 x j y i y j t i t j t j 1 t j y j 1 y j s e d i x i x i 2 y i y i 2 the average sed of a single trajectory is denoted as s a s e d then 8 s a s e d 1 n i 1 n s e d i the average sed of all trajectories is denoted as a a s e d then 9 a a s e d 1 n i 1 n s a s e d i where n is the number of track points of the original trajectory t s n represents the total number of ship trajectories definition 3 length loss rate llr llr is the ratio of the difference between the original track length and the compressed track length to the original track length 10 llr i 1 i j 1 j 1 p j p j 1 i 1 i j 1 j 1 p j p j 1 i 1 i j 1 j 1 p j p j 1 i denotes the number of ship trajectories j represents the number of original track points of each ship p j p j 1 is the distance between two adjacent points of the original trajectory and j is the number of compressed track points of each ship p j p j 1 is the distance between two adjacent points of the compressed trajectory definition 4 critical threshold of point ξ t s is the set of trajectory points a t s if a distance threshold just makes trajectory point a a key point after compression the threshold is called the critical threshold of point a recorded as ξ 2 3 1 3 definition 5 threshold change rate k after compression there will be a ξ for each trajectory and each trajectory will be divided into two sub trajectories as shown in fig 4 and table 1 where the p th compression represents the compression at which the p th critical threshold ξ is obtained let the set of critical thresholds of all points in a trajectory is m ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ p ξ n ξ p is the critical threshold of the p th compression n is the number of critical thresholds and the step between two adjacent ξ is one then the critical threshold change rate of the p th critical threshold is 11 k p ξ p ξ p 1 p n 1 p 1 0 p n 2 3 1 4 definition 6 optimal threshold change rate k o when k p k o k p i i 1 2 p 1 the trajectory consisting of points corresponding to the critical threshold ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ p 1 those points are called as key points kpt can maintain a high similarity with the original trajectory under keeping a high compression rate k o is the optimal threshold change rate the value taking of k 0 will be introduced in detail in section 2 4 2 3 2 running time optimization compared with online compression algorithms offline compression algorithms have the advantage of global optimum but many offline compression algorithms are time consuming to conquer the problem zhao et al 2018 adopted the method of detecting transition points they used the transition points to divide the trajectory into straight and curve part based on their different properties after that they compressed the two parts separately by the dp algorithm thereby reducing the compression time however this method diminishes the advantage of the global optimum of the dp algorithm besides it has its limitations for some ship trajectories such as ship no 4 in table 9 in our algorithm we use matrix operation to calculate the maximum distance from point to line let the sub trajectory segment of the maximum distance be calculated be s u b t t 1 t i t m t i x i y i the linear equation with the line connecting the beginning and end points t 1 and t m as the baseline is a x b y c 0 then 12 d 1 d i d m x 1 y 1 x i x m y i y m a b then the maximum distance from the point in s u b t to the baseline is 13 d 1 m i n d 1 d i d m d 2 m a x d 1 d i d m d m a x m a x d 1 c a 2 b 2 d 2 c a 2 b 2 moreover we have a new method for time optimization that is to reduce the number of points to be calculated let an original trajectory be ts the method is as follows a filter out the points in ts of which the course change difference is less than δ θ and restore the remaining points into the set of turning points cs when the number of points between two turning points is larger than δ n δ n is generally 10 30 insert several points so that the number of points between the two turning points is less than δ n as the red points in fig 2 a have shown b figure out the point in cs with the largest distance from the baseline and denoted it as p as shown in fig 2 b c calculate the distance from the points around p to the baseline and find out the maximum value the maximum value is the maximum distance from the point of the original trajectory ts to the baseline as shown in fig 2 c fig 3 shows the relation between filtration rate and δ θ filtration rate is the ratio of the number of filtered trajectory points to the original number of trajectory points when δ θ 3 the filtration rate is 87 68 a a s e d 71 9 m when δ θ 10 the filtration rate is 94 00 a a s e d 110 7 m when δ θ 10 the change of filtration rate is insignificant by the method of filtering out the non turning points the computation efficiency can be greatly improved especially when the number of points is large however the method requires two calculations to find the maximum value of the sub trajectory which in practical applications may be affected by unstable operating environment and reduces the computation efficiency therefore we recommend that this method only be used when the number of points in the sub trajectory is above 500 points as shown by line20 line30 in algorithm 2 for the filtration of non turning points see algorithm 1 algorithm 1 filtration of non turning points input trajectory points set t s δ θ δ n output set of turning points c s 1 function c a l c u t p t s δ θ δ n 2 s 0 e s 1 c

represents the initial input compressed trajectory c s is the set of turning points in t s after compression the kpt the critical threshold ξ p calculated by the method in 2 3 2 similarly hereinafter corresponding to the key points and the sub trajectory segment s t p q s t p q q n a n d q 2 represents the q th sub trajectory segment obtained by the p th compression will be obtained and the critical threshold ξ p q corresponding to the key points k p t p q in s t p q will be calculated s e t s t k s and s e t ξ represent the set of sub trajectory segment s t p q key points kpt and the critical threshold ξ p corresponding to kpt after compression respectively if k p k o ξ p d i s l i m i t d i s l i m i t represents the lower limit of ξ p its value is explained in section 2 4 are satisfied then take s t max ξ that corresponds to the maximum ξ p in s e t s t as the next compressed trajectory segment to be input and delete s t max ξ in s e t s t otherwise the loop ends assuming that both k o and d i s l i m i t are zero then the ts compression process in fig 4 b will be shown in the following table 1 fig 4 c shows the change of ξ of each point in ts 2 3 4 adaptive threshold a good trajectory compression algorithm can reduce distortion as much as possible while keeping a high compression rate normally the larger the threshold value the higher the compression rate and the severer the distortion thus it is not easy to determine an appropriate threshold that can help to achieve a balance between the compression rate and distortion generally the ξ of most key points should be larger than that of most non key points in a trajectory when speed changes are not taken into consideration as shown in fig 1 the ξ of point t 4 is much larger than that of other points and the ξ of point t 9 is much larger than that of points other than point t 4 fig 6 represents the change of the ξ of each track point in the randomly selected 200 ship trajectories arranged in chronological order of the ξ obtained by each compression the ordinate represents the value of the ξ and the abscissa represents the order that ξ is obtained fig 5 is the original trajectory of the 200 trajectories in fig 6 as area 1 and area 2 in fig 6 have shown for the points before area 2 the ξ are large and decrease rapidly while for the points after area 2 the ξ are small and decrease slowly in section 2 4 we introduce in detail how to determine the adaptive distance threshold of each trajectory by the change characteristics of the ξ of all points 2 4 distance threshold determination 2 4 1 critical threshold fitting it can be seen from fig 6 that the change trend of the ξ of all track points in the trajectories is similar and the trend is the same with the change trend of function y k x k 0 thus in this study we use the leastsq of scipy optimize in python to fit the discrete critical thresholds given the poor flexibility of y k x we assumed our fitting curve equation be 14 y a d x b c formula 14 is a fitting curve function that y varies with x according to the assumption in fig 6 where a b c and d are parameters of the fitting function the larger a is the flatter the curve will be the larger d and c are the more convex the curve will be b indicates that the curve is translated to the left by b units d and c have a greater influence on the degree of convexity of the curve than a the goodness of fit r 2 of the three fitted curves in fig 7 can be calculated by formula 15 r 2 a l l is 0 53 r 2 t 0 is 0 70 r 2 t 17 is 0 91 although the critical thresholds of the 200 trajectories show the same change trend the flatness of each curve varies some even vary greatly therefore the goodness of fit r 2 of the fitted curve for all trajectories is relatively small but still acceptable from the fitting results of fig 7 it can be seen that the fitting curve equation we assumed is justifiable 15 r 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i is the true value its mean value is y and the fitted value is y ˆ i the following equation 16 is a fitted curve equation obtained using the leastsq of scipy optimize in python it can be obtained that a 321 32 b 0 03 c 1 22 d 0 11 16 y 321 32 0 11 x 0 03 1 22 the curve change of equation 16 is shown in fig 8 among the 200 randomly selected trajectories the most obviously downward convex one is t 17 the least obviously downward convex one is t 0 thus we also fitted the fitted curves of the critical thresholds of these two trajectories the fitting results are shown in fig 7 in section 2 4 2 we use the fitted curve to calculate the optimal threshold change rate k o mentioned in definition 5 2 4 2 calculation of optimal threshold change rate k o 2 4 2 1 definition 7 angle change rate r angle change rate refers to the change rate in the tangent direction between two adjacent points in the fitted curve which is calculated by formula 18 as shown in figs 6 and 7 the line in area 3 is vertical although the critical thresholds change rapidly their direction changes little the line in area 4 is horizontal the critical threshold changes a little and the direction is almost unchanged the change from vertical to horizontal direction mainly occurs in area 1 therefore in this paper we calculate the optimal threshold change rate according to the angle change rate between two adjacent points in the fitted curve in other words the threshold change rate corresponding to the point with the maximum angle change rate is the optimal threshold change rate k o take derivative of equation 14 it can be obtained that 17 y a c d d x b c 1 thus the angle change rate between the p th point and the p 1 th point is 18 r p tan 1 y p tan 1 y p 1 the angle change rate of the curve in fig 8 can be obtained by formulas 17 and 18 according to the change of the angle change rate of the curve as shown in fig 9 when x 38 there will be a theoretically optimal threshold change rate which is k o a l l 1 68 similarly the theoretically optimal threshold change rate of t 0 is k o 0 1 71 w h e n x 124 the theoretically optimal threshold change rate of t 17 is k o 17 1 36 w h e n x 25 to ensure that the theoretically optimal threshold change rates of all ship trajectories are greater than k o set in algorithm we set k o m i n k o a l l k o 0 k o 17 in the proposed algorithm in some cases such as observing the state of ship traffic flow in the whole water a high compression rate is needed but in other cases such as studying the motion situation of a single ship high accuracy of compression is required zhang 2015 therefore to meet the needs of different accuracies of compressed trajectory in different applications we introduce the compression control parameter μ the default value is 0 5 under the condition of adaptive threshold 19 k o 1 36 μ 1 μ 0 μ 1 it can be seen from fig 10 and table 2 using formula 11 to calculate k p the compression results is not ideal of which the reason is as follows when calculating k p according to formula 11 the occurrence of abnormal conditions will cause that ξ p is equal or nearly equal to ξ p 1 which will result in the calculated k p is smaller than k o consequently the compression will end up compared with the fitting curve the change of the ξ is not very smooth and there are even some fluctuations when a ship turns back and forth in a water area there will be some key thresholds that are similar or even the same resulting in an error between the change rate of actually optimal threshold and the theoretically optimal threshold as shown in t 0 in fig 7 thus to avoid the aforementioned problems we use formula 20 instead of formula 11 to calculate the threshold change rate k p of the p th critical threshold 20 k p ξ p max d i s s e t o r l e n d i s s e t 3 max max d i s s e t ξ p ξ p min d i s s e t o t h e r s where d i s s e t is the subset ξ p l ξ p 1 of m ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ p ξ n ξ p is the value of the p th critical threshold and ξ p 3 the p 3 th μ is compression control parameter the default value is 0 5 in formula 20 max max d i s s e t ξ p ξ p min d i s s e t may be slightly larger than ξ p ξ p 1 or ξ p 1 ξ p which will bring about the increase of few key points but it avoids the result caused by formula 11 fig 11 and table 3 are the compression result when k p of the p th critical threshold is calculated by formula 20 and it can be seen that it is more reasonable to compute k p by formula 20 when the parameter μ is small some redundant points will be retained in the compression process to avoid such situation we introduced the distance limit value d i s l i m i t under the condition of adaptive threshold that is the points with distance that is smaller than d i s l i m i t will be discarded and the value of d i s l i m i t is 0 10 21 d i s l i m i t 10 e x p log 10 μ when μ 0 5 d i s l i m i t 7 4 for the implementation of the algorithm see algorithm 2 line 7 to 16 in algorithm 2 is to examine whether the track points are key points or not for the traditional dp algorithm when the maximum distance of the calculated track segment exceeds the distance threshold the corresponding segment will be divided into two sub segments then the computation will be repeated until the algorithm fails to meet the setting condition while adp algorithm adopts the method of selecting the maximum ξ of all the sub track segments to examine critical points as illustrated in line 8 to 9 algorithm 2 trajectory compression input original track points set t s μ the default value is 0 5 k o 1 36 μ 1 μ d i s l i m i t

algorithm with the traditional dp algorithm the improved compression algorithm based on dp algorithm partition dp herein proposed by zhao et al 2018 and the improved compression algorithm based on sliding window sliding window herein proposed by gao et al 2019 the algorithms were compared mainly from four aspects namely compression rate formula 5 6 sed formula 7 9 llr formula 10 and running time of data compressing the trajectory data of the estuary of yangtze river from june 1 2017 to june 3 2017 were used for testing the data contains ais trajectories of 2775 ships with 3103471 track points the points with wrong ship position have been removed including 1814892 track points with error static information the length or width of the ship is less than 1m the ratio of length to width is greater than 10 or less than 4 the total length of trajectories of all ships is 227988572 69m and the information is given in table 4 the algorithm was implemented on the computer windows 64bit with eight cores intel r core tm i7 7700hq cpu 2 80 ghz 2 81 ghz and 24 gb of ram using python3 7 3 2 introduction to the algorithms used for comparison partition dp algorithm zhao 2018 according to partition dp algorithm a ship trajectory is divided into straight part and curve part and they exhibit different properties the straight part as the main part of ship trajectory is lengthy and easily compressed while the curve part is laconic and has more shapes when compressing ship trajectory the traditional dp algorithm does not distinguish between the two parts causing the track points of straight part being repeatedly calculated which means that most calculations are unnecessary zhao et al attached great importance to the transition points between straight and curve part they held that the transition points should be kept no matter how high the compression rate or how small the turning radius is partition dp algorithm mainly identifies the transition points based on the change of the ship course the algorithm is mainly divided into two steps that is segmentation and compression based on dp algorithm in the first step the algorithm calculates the course difference δ c between each track point and the fifth track point and compares the values of δ c between two adjacent points if the values of δ c of the two track points are greater than 10 and less than 10 respectively the aforementioned track points will be termed as transition points according to these transition points the trajectory will be divided into several sub trajectories for the second step each sub trajectory will be compressed by the traditional dp algorithm and the threshold is 0 5 times to 1 time the ship length the appropriate proportion for waters near islands is usually 0 1 to 10 times the ship length sliding window algorithm gao 2019 gao et al 2019 combined the sliding window algorithm ship navigation angle deviation position deviation and ais spatio temporal characteristics to determine kfp key feature point according to the ship domain model proposed by fujii 1971 the long axis of ship domain is 8 times the ship length and the short axis is 3 2 times the ship length in this compression algorithm the distance threshold is regarded as 0 2 5 times the ship width the threshold of the ship navigation angle deviation is 0 12 by referring to the diagram of the redundant information rejection ratio the obtained optimal distance threshold is 0 731 1 274 times the ship width and the threshold of the ship navigation angle deviation is 3 8 5 as summarized in table 5 trajectory compression algorithms have different characteristics in terms of their guarantees on compression and time complexity their advantages and disadvantages will be further illustrated in section 3 3 and section 4 3 3 test results in this study our comparison is based on the optimal threshold of each algorithm the threshold of adp algorithm is μ 0 5 the authors of the other three algorithms didn t mention about parameter setting under different water areas therefore we can only refer to the research results of academics with expertise in this field coldwell t g 1983 fujii y 1984 zhao j s 1993 lisowski j 2000 szlapczynski 2006 wang 2010 zhang 2016 sánchez heres 2019 and take the median of the parameter range they proposed as the threshold of the algorithm the distance threshold of partition dp and dp is 0 8 times the ship length the distance threshold of sliding window is the ship width and the navigation angle deviation threshold is 4 5 the test results are shown in table 6 the four algorithms have different acr under their respective optimal threshold dp has the highest acr but its llr and aased are the largest besides it has the lowest computation efficiency partition dp s acr is similar to dp s and it also has large llr and aased but partition dp has the highest computation efficiency adp algorithm also has a high acr and its llr and aased are small the aased of adp is smaller than that of the sliding window which has an acr of 89 16 moreover adp has a high computation efficiency sliding window has the lowest acr and llr and it also has a high computation efficiency however the aased of sliding window is larger than of adp which has an acr of 96 63 we also compared the compression of the four algorithms under the same acr as shown in table 7 and fig 12 sliding window has time saving advantage since the algorithm first calculates the navigation angle and distance deviation its compression time is not affected by acr that is the running time of the algorithm will rarely increase as acr reduces in addition the algorithm can always keep time consumption low when acr is greater than 98 89 the partition dp algorithm is the most efficient when acr is less than 96 02 adp has a high computation efficiency which ranks only second to sliding window dp is the one has the lowest computation efficiency sliding window has the highest computation efficiency but it has the largest llr and aased in other words sliding window has the lowest compression quality under the same acr with other three algorithms among the other three algorithms when acr is above 86 35 adp has the lowest llr and aased followed by dp compared with dp and adp partition dp has both larger llr and aased in other words when acr is high adp has the highest compression quality followed by dp and the compression quality of partition dp is relatively low when acr is very high adp shows obvious advantages compared to the other three algorithms when the compression rate is low the compression quality of all the algorithms is satisfactory except for sliding window and there is no big difference in the values of llr and aased among them fig 13 shows the running time of the four algorithms for single ship trajectory compression due to that the compression rates of the same trajectory of the four algorithms are different fig 13 cannot be to evaluate the algorithms operational efficiency but it can be seen from fig 13 that the efficiency of the adp algorithm and the sliding window algorithm are relatively stable while for the traditional dp algorithm and partition dp algorithm exception occurred when they are compressing some trajectories the exception occurred mainly due to the error information of ship length which is 0m it can be seen from table 4 that in the ais ship trajectory information half of the static information of track points is wrong 4 discussion in order to further validate the feasibility and superiority of the adp algorithm we randomly selected four trajectories from the 2775 trajectories to conduct test analysis information of trajectories is given in table 8 from table 8 we can see that some ships have abnormal static information for example the length of the ship with maritime mobile service identify mmsi number of 357063000 is 417m but the width of the ship is only 5m and the length and width of the ship with mmsi number of 412435750 are both 0m since the threshold of trajectory compression is determined based on the length and width of ships the ship information errors will inevitably reduce the reliability of trajectory compression in this study our comparison is based on the optimal threshold of each algorithm the threshold of adp algorithm is μ 0 5 the distance threshold of partition dp and dp is 0 8 times the ship length the distance threshold of sliding window is the ship width and its navigation angle deviation threshold is 4 5 comparison results are shown in table 9 and fig 14 for ship no 1 due to the incorrect static information the distance thresholds of partition dp algorithm and dp algorithm are high resulting in many key track points being lost as shown in areas a and b in fig 14 we suggest that for ship no 1 the distance threshold of partition dp algorithm and dp algorithm be 0 08 0 2 times of ship length rather than the recommended 0 8 times of ship length for sliding window due to that it saves more turning points which account for 79 76 of all key points its scr is low though sliding window has a lower llr than adp of which the scr is 98 19 its sased is much larger than adp s compared to the other three algorithms adp algorithm can maintain a low llr 0 070 and a small sased 47 91m while maintaining a high scr 98 19 it can be seen from fig 14 that although the adp algorithm does not consider the ship s course it retains enough turning points for ship no 2 dp algorithm partition dp algorithm and sliding window all fail to compress the data due to the error of ship static information the length and width of the ship are both 0m however adp algorithm is not affected by the error and could still compress data normally and at the same time it maintains a high scr as well as low llr and sased different from the other three test ships ship no 3 has smaller sailing waters and fewer track points when compressing the trajectory of ship no 3 partition dp algorithm and dp algorithm completely lost the ship s original trajectory shape therefore we suggest that for ship no 3 the distance threshold of partition dp algorithm and dp algorithm be 0 03 0 07 times of ship length rather than the recommended 0 8 times of ship length sliding window has the lowest llr and sased but its scr is the lowest which is because it retains many turning points showing the defect of sliding window as can be seen from the c area in fig 14 where sliding window missed some key points because it is sensitive for sliding window to detect the change of angle but difficult to detect the change of distance when the distance threshold is 0 09 0 2 times of the ship width it can detect missed key points when the distance threshold is 0 09 times the ship width and the angle threshold is 9 its scr is 48 0 llr is 0 428 and sased is 5 23m and this compression result is better than the result under the threshold recommended by sliding window compared to these algorithms our algorithm can have a high scr at keeping a low llr and sased for ship no 4 the scr of sliding window algorithm is low due to the varieties of ship s course especially when the 99 95 of key feature points are turning points certainly it also has the lowest llr and sased for partition dp algorithm it divides the trajectory into 138 segments with 141 key feature points and 139 segmentation points resulting in its lower scr and higher llr when compared to adp algorithm but the difference between its sased and adp s is very small it can be concluded from the comparison that though the researchers of dp partition dp and sliding window have provided recommended thresholds those thresholds fail to bring about satisfactory compression for some ships when waters change when there are errors in ship static information the compression of algorithms with thresholds that are based on ship length or width will be greatly affected adp uses threshold change rate as the termination condition which is irrelevant to waters and ais static information therefore adp does not have the above two problems showing the feasibility and superiority of the adp algorithm 5 conclusion in this paper the adp algorithm on the basis of dp algorithm was developed and tested the experiment demonstrate that compared with the traditional dp algorithm adp algorithm has made great progress on running time due to that the distance thresholds of the three algorithms are related to the ship length or width their compression will be affected by the error ship static information which will result in poor compression as ship no 1 in fig 14 has shown unsuccessful compression as the ship no 2 in fig 14 has shown or compression being affected by the vary of waters as the ship no 3 in fig 14 has shown however the adp algorithm has no these problems because its distance threshold is not determined by the ship s static information but by the change characteristics of the critical threshold of each track point therefore the adp algorithm can not only compress the trajectories of inland ships but also the trajectories of ships at sea nevertheless adp algorithm has its deficiencies for ships with constantly circling movement the compression of the adp algorithm is not very satisfactory as shown by t0 in fig 11 besides it does not take account of ship s course and speed although sliding window algorithm takes ship s course into consideration it only retains track point on the condition that the navigation deviation is greater than a certain value as a result it is difficult to have a high compression rate and at the same time ensuring low distortion to solve the problem we will consider the role of ship course and speed in a better way in our future study

20711,in the present work a metamodeling with computational fluid dynamics cfd method for the hydrodynamic optimisations of deflectors on the multi wing trawl door is introduced then a comparative analysis of kriging and artificial neural networks metamodeling methods is carried out using the effects of relative camber thickness and the installed angles of deflectors on the hydrodynamics as a case study for optimisations based on cfd simulations verified by the wind tunnel experiment a strict procedure including metamodeling and multi objective genetic algorithm is established efficiency and accuracy between the two methods are discussed finally this study studied the flow patterns of the optimal otter board in the higher working efficiency state the results showed that kriging performs better than artificial neural networks methods in 2 factor metamodeling however in the 3 factor investigation artificial neural networks has more advantages in the prediction of drag while kriging is better in the lift component of hydrodynamics the relative camber has the considerable impacts on the hydrodynamics of the trawl door whereas the thickness of deflectors shows the prominent influence on the resistances followed by lift forces the effect of installed angles on the hydrodynamic loadings is more remarkable than that of thickness and relative camber in flow visualisation the

introduction trawl door which is also called otter board is an essential component to facilitate the expansion of trawl mouth in the horizontal direction and its resistance accounts for 30 of the total resistance of the trawl system during the process of working hydrodynamics of the otter board and its adaptability to marine environmental protection will directly affect the efficiency of trawl catch sterling and centre 2000 therefore the improvement of hydrodynamic performance reducing the resistance and maintaining stability are the core issues in the design or optimisation of the otter board in recent years the application of the multi wing or the airfoil shaped otter board is widely accepted due to the better hydrodynamic performance compared with the traditional one panel structures as the deflectors could delay flow separation xu et al 2018 a novel hltd with the aerofoil deflectors outline was proposed aspect ratio ar and camber ratio are treated as the vital elements in improving the hydrodynamics of hltd and its actual performance had been validated and compared detailedly with the traditional cambered trawl door through cfd simulations flume experiments and sea trials you et al 2020b a discussions regarding deflectors have dominated researches about the multi wing otter board prior studies generally confirmed that the configuration of multiple deflectors with varying installed angles ias and camber ratio can improve hydrodynamic performances of the otter board wang et al 2017 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018b based on the cfd simulation and orthogonal design xu et al 2018 investigated nine factors related to hydrodynamic performances of deflectors and the otter board including ar camber ratio ias and the intervals between deflectors and the main panel then finally provided with an optimisation case as an evolution of the rectangular type otter board the hydrodynamic efficiency of vertical cambered multi wing trawl door performs better than others do the installation of deflectors or several slots on the dominant panel contributes to decreasing streamwise hydro pressure drops however the affiliated deflectors designs and optimisations are sensitive to stabilities weights and hydrodynamics affecting the actual fishing operations considerably prior researches have extensively explored the hydrodynamics of double wing otter board but few studies have targeted multi wing otter board consisting of more than two deflectors moreover a comprehensive study related to deflector structural factors are meaningful and the thickness factor was also overlooked in most hydrodynamic studies since it is relevant to the structural strength and weights the effect of thickness on the hydrodynamics of otter boards should be understood before the decision making in the engineering fields the relationships between independent variables and the corresponding dependent responses are not explicitly linear for the complicated structures as a consequence it demands great costs of time and resources to give quantitative explanations or full factor analysis despite the advancements of computational or experimental abilities kusiak et al 2015 considering the efficiency and accuracy while optimising the metamodeling or so called response surface method rsm is influential as a feasible strategy of comprehensive experimental designs and mathematical modellings rsm majors in predicting the quantitative relationship among independent variables and induced results within the global scope of design space by carrying out several tests of representative points compared with the typical experimental design for instance orthogonal design the advantages of metamodelings are to form intuitional insights about the interactions and associations between qualitative and quantitative factors considering the efficiency and accuracy fonseca et al 2003 wang et al 2014 in the optimisation procedure involved metamodeling the optimal solution can be addressed through the genetic algorithm ga at last the combination of rsm and ga has been gradually applied in the fishery engineering in recent years wang et al 2020 you et al 2020a with computational fluid dynamics cfd a shape optimisation methodology using local surrogate models for the multi element trawl door was firstly proposed by leifsson et al 2015 then multi layer feed forward network along with ga was adopted to optimise the shape of bi plane typed otter board takahashi et al 2017 proving the rationality of theoretical analysis as the continuation of this work you et al 2020a validated the results obtained from rsm and multi objective genetic algorithm moga using particle image velocimetry piv experiments proving the efficiency of this pattern besides wang et al 2020 revealed the effect of euler angles on the hydrodynamics of a vertical cambered trawl door by a strict workflow of kriging methods and moga using a constant global model and localised gaussian correction function the kriging method can yield a more accurate approximation for the general optimisations li et al 2013 and anns showed high capacities when metamodeling complex non linear functions without the need to predetermine the form of the model leshno et al 1993 in kusiak et al 2015 the authors concluded that kriging technique is less sensitive to the number of experimental points than anns approach but the latter performed better in the metamodeling and optimisations of the complex objectives to the best of authors knowledge it is evident that artificial neural networks anns and kriging methods can build meta models amongst hydrodynamic non linear variables but further efficiencies and accuracies are not addressed by comparisons besides a rigorous and universal procedure combining the above metamodeling with moga should be emphasised and validated for the optimisation the motivation for this paper is to present a metamodeling with cfd simulations section 2 3 for hydrodynamics optimisations of deflectors on a multi wing trawl door for the bottom trawling section 2 1 a strict workflow consisting of metamodeling and moga is proposed in goal handling with respect to constrains section 2 5 wherein the efficiency and accuracy of two metamodelings applied to various situations for the trawl door are compared in section 3 2 the effects of deflector on the hydrodynamic characteristics c d c l and c p c of the multi wing trawl door are studied following the above guidelines section 3 3 thickness relative camber rc and three ias are selected as the essential structural parameters of deflectors then classified into 2 factor and 3 factor metamodelings lastly we have provided the optimum cases for deflectors on the otter board inherited from the moga analysis section 3 4 and it is validated further based on flow visualisation section 3 5 2 material and methods 2 1 the otter board model the investigated otter board is a kind of vertical cambered multi wing otter board fig 1 scale ratio 1 4 following the reynolds number similarity criterion which is made of carbon structural steel q235 and painted on the surface with anti rust material and the quantitative dimensions are as illustrated in table 1 this kind of device composed of deflectors and the main panel is adopted commonly in the west africa bottom trawler with a power of 880 kw and towing speed reaches maximum 3 kn in this research the deflector camber is defined as the distance from the mid arc to the chord and rc is the ratio of the camber to the chord as fig 1 presents rc and the thickness of all the deflectors in this prototype are 12 and 3 mm separately considering the geometric completeness i e the overall geometry cannot vary greatly with deflectors of the otter board and the field production experience while trawling the adjustable range of the thickness and rc of all the deflectors are 1 mm 8 mm and 1 13 respectively ia is referred as the angle between the chord of deflector and the horizontal direction ranges for δ α δ β and δ γ are 6 37 4 25 and 2 13 respectively supposing that a larger range for the thickness rc and ias are in demand the wing end plates and other irrelevant components of the trawl door would be affected bringing in other uncertainties for the optimisation study one should be noted that the lower left corner of each deflector is fixed as the centre point then variations of ias δ ias are achieved through the rotation of each deflector around the centre point 2 2 experimental validation in order to validate the accuracy of numerical simulation the wind tunnel experiment of the otter board model is conducted in the nh 2 low speed wind tunnel located in nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics china this measurement is carried out in a small test section of which dimensions are 6 m length 3 m width 2 5 m height and the cross sectional area equals to 7 18 m2 fig 2 the otter board model and the six component mechanical tower balance are jointed with a rob connection which is used to adjust the angle of attack aoa of the model and located in the tunnel section centre region the aoa between the otter board chord and incoming flow ranges from 0 to 70 intervals of 2 5 are used for the aoa ranging of 0 50 followed by intervals of 5 ranging from 50 to 70 wind speed 28 m s is employed in this test corresponding to re 9 5 10 5 the turbulent flow regimes around and induced hydrodynamic loadings on the square plate structures are equilibrated as r e reaches super critical scope hoerner and f 1965 or so called self modelling region through the r e similarity criterion the full scale trawl door hydrodynamics with a towing speed from 0 5 3 kn for the trawler can be implied by the wind tunnel measurements with 28 m s during the test the six component tower balance remains static and the rob connection can be rotated to achieve the aoa a conversion module inside the tower balance can measure fluid dynamics indexes all tested data is performed the bracket interference correction accomplished by removing the effects of bare rob nevertheless according to the previous experience of wind tunnel test this correction method cannot altogether remove the irrelevant effects of bare rob resulting in a little error between real value and experimental value especially around small aoa vicinity the cases of which aoa equals 0 10 are discarded in the following parts 2 3 numerical modelling the numerical simulation is conducted by cfx code which uses element based finite volume method ebfvm filippini et al 2014 to solve the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations in this study 2nd order total variation diminishing scheme is used to deal with the discretisation of convective term while the standard finite element approach is adopted to deal with the diffusion term adjustable time step oscillates around 1 0 1 0 4 s during a 30s calculation assuring the courant number equals 0 75 to achieve the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition temporally and spatially the adoption of standard k ϵ turbulence model combined with the explicit algebraic reynolds stress models earsm can ensure flow modelling and induced hydrodynamic loadings accuracies at critical or super critical r e region it has been verified and compared to typical standard k ϵ model and re normalisation group rng k ϵ in wang et al 2020 coupled with earsm the reynolds stresses are modelled from the anisotropy tensor according to its definition eq 1 1 u i u j k a i j 2 3 δ i j where k is the modelled turbulent kinematic energy δ i j is the kronecker delta function while anisotropy tensor a i j in the matrix a is determined as a solution of the following quasi linear equation λ a a 1 s a ω ω a a 2 as sa 2 3 t r as 2 λ a 3 a 4 p k ϵ where s and ω represent non dimensional strain rate and vorticity tensors separately the coefficients in this matrix equation hinge on the c i coefficients of the pressure strain term in the underlying reynolds stress transport model the above constants are referred as a 1 1 245 a 2 0 a 3 1 8 a 4 2 25 p k is the production term of turbulent kinematic energy which could be integrated with ϵ turbulent dissipation rate closured by the standard k ϵ model above all the explicit anisotropy tensor a i j can be obtained based on a polynomial based on the strain rate and the vorticity tensors which has been introduced in wallin and johansson 2000 in detail the computational domain in fig 3 consists of an outer domain and a small domain embedded in the former considering the accuracy of cfd simulations it is crucial to set up an inner domain close to the structures with the finer grids capturing the largely gradient variation of flow fields around the otter board the scale of the outer computational domain is the same as the experimental wind tunnel while the inner domain is 6l length 3l width 3l height inlet and outlet are defined as the entrance of flow and exit of the computational domain in the x direction respectively moreover k and ϵ are initialised as the turbulent intensity based on the clarification of wang et al 2018a in order to facilitate comparison with the wind tunnel test the fluid media adopted in the numerical simulation is incompressible air with v 28 m s given that the fluid could discharge completely the outlet boundary is the pressure outlet with a relative pressure 0 pa besides all surfaces of the otter board and other surfaces of the domain are assumed to be the no slip walls from fig 4 the unstructured tetrahedral grids are adopted in the far field domain and the near wall region is refined with the 10 layer prismatic layers of which the first layer thickness is 1 8 10 4 m ensuring y 15 therefore wall function is also utilised for near wall treatment in the high r e separation flow the mesh convergence test is also implemented to ensure the verification of the numerical simulation of which drag and lift force are selected as the target indices it is shown in fig 5 two hydrodynamics indices get stable once the grid number reaches 4 million the deviations of the drag and lift forces among the last three cases are less than 1 therefore considering the balance of computational efficiency and accuracy the mesh patterns of which grid numbers 6 7 10 6 is chosen to continue further studies the total number of nodes and elements in each case are reported approximately 1 26 10 6 and 6 7 10 6 respectively 2 4 data statistics the time averaged drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l related to the hydrodynamics can be calculated using the experimental or simulation value of drag force f d and lift force f l presented as follows 3 c d 2 f d ρ s v 2 4 c l 2 f l ρ s v 2 where ρ is the fluid density s is the plane area of the otter board v is the incoming flow velocity the moment coefficient c m c and the centre of pressure coefficient along the chord direction c p c associated with the stability performance of the otter board while trawling were listed below 5 c m c 2 m c ρ s l v 2 6 c n c d sin a o a c l cos a o a 7 c p c e 1 m c f n l e 1 l c m c c n where c p c represents the equivalent positions of the hydrodynamics acting on the otter board in the chord direction wang et al 2020 xu et al 2017 reflecting the stability issue of structures more specifically the significant change of c p c might lead to the overturn accident of the otter board cui 1997 due to the structural symmetry of the structure it is unnecessary to derive the centre of pressure coefficient along the span 2 5 a novel metamodeling workflow with cfd simulations in this chapter a novel metamodeling workflow with simulations and moga is introduced as a feasible strategy for the optimisation of structures wherein the earsm k ϵ model is utilised embedded in design of experiments doe and refinements as demonstrated in fig 6 central composite design ccd an experimental design methodology widely used in establishing metamodelings in the process of optimisation studies selukar et al 1995 is adopted to generate design points in the whole design space the design points are used to construct response surfaces in the metamodelings finally optimisation constraints are predefined before moga and then the genetic algorithm optimiser is utilised to analyse the existing response surface in the metamodelings three candidates satisfied the contrasts are picked up from the metamodel to evaluate metamodel qualities the candidate points generated through moga should be validated via cfd simulations however the prediction accuracy using metamodeling might not be insufficient due to the limited quantities of design points the solution to this problem lies in additional refinements which are to reconstruct the response surface by increasing the unqualified candidate points produced by moga to the metamodeling then run the moga for a second time compared to that reported in wang et al 2020 this refinement in the upgraded workflow is more demand oriented as focusing on the optimisation as depicted in fig 6 the unqualified candidates via the initial moga are determined once the relative discrepancies of all targeted parameters amongst three candidates between cfd validated results with metamodeling predictions achieve 1 conversely it applies to the workflow termination as well based on this rigorous feedback the response surface accuracy can be guaranteed to a great extent 2 5 1 design of experiments ccd is an efficient means to gather more data with a few numbers of discrete design points this design method is composed of three parts 1 a full factorial or fractional factorial design 2 an additional design often a star design in which experimental points are at a distance a from its centre more usually a takes diverse values based on rotatability and orthogonality of the design and number of experiments 3 a central point lundstedt et al 1998 generally the demand for the 2 factor metamodeling points is 9 whereas 3 factor metamodeling requires 15 design cases for instance the distribution of 15 cases for ias metamodeling is illustrated as fig 7 2 5 2 kriging metamodeling initially used in aid geologists analysing mineral deposits kriging modelling can provide the linear unbiased estimation of the intermediate and unknown values in a limited space by taking the information from some neighbouring points instead of full factor cases gano et al 2006 the ordinary kriging model adopted in this paper is clarified below 8 y x f x z x where y x is the unknown target function representing the interest response point f x is the low order polynomial function representing the global approximation of the response surface the stochastic term z x indicating the local behaviour of model is shown as follows 9 z x i 1 n λ i r x i x in addition z x obeys gauss stochastic distribution with zero mean and covariance 10 c o v z x i z x j σ 2 r r x i x j where σ 2 represents the variable of z x r is a symmetric correlation matrix with ones along diagonal of which dimension is n 0 n 0 and r x i x j is the gaussian spatial correction function between any two of the n 0 sample point presented as follows 11 r x i x j exp k 1 m θ k x k i x k j 2 where m is the number of the design variables adopted in doe θ k is the unknown coefficient of correction furthermore σ is the function of θ k x k i and x k j are the k th components of the sample points x i and x j separately predicted estimates y ˆ x of the real values y x at the untested points x is given by 12 y ˆ β ˆ r t x r 1 y f β ˆ 13 r t x r x x 1 r x x 2 r x x n 0 to solve the eq 11 θ k can be evaluated by solving the maximum likelihood estimation mle equations maximising the log likelihood function shown in eq 14 in summary the kriging model can be determined once the θ k is given 14 maximise n 0 ln σ 2 ln r θ k 2 subject to 0 θ k 2 5 3 artificial neural networks metamodeling anns are quite highly efficient computational tools to predict the distribution patterns of the outputs based on the inputs indeed this method uses a limited number of design points to build the approximation its original mechanism is to mimic the computational skills of the interconnected neurons in the brain as one of the most widely adopted algorithms among the anns multi layer feed forward neural network combined with the back propagation deep learning strategy rumelhart et al 1986 was utilised in this research the structure of the multi layer feed forward neural network is composed of three layers as fig 8 illustrates the input layer the hidden layer the output layer and the neighbouring interconnections generally the input layer contains many neurons of which number is consistent with that of design variables the objective in the input layer is to receive and transform into the input variables via the varying weights and an identity transfer function secondly each of the cells in the input layer can be exported unidirectionally to all neurons through the interconnections in the following hidden layer in the hidden layer the capabilities of anns can be enhanced to deal robustly and efficiently with inherently complex non linear relations between the inputs and the outputs of the network medsker 1994 the dominating feature of the hidden layer is to assign various weights to cells and complete the summation of the former through the transfer function the weighting is issued from an algorithm that minimises as the least squares method the distance between the interpolation and the known values design points in addition a successful learning lies in the bias introduced prior to each layer shifting the activation function through a trainable constant finally the output obtained via the above process can be exported to a single cell in the output layer shora et al 2018 it should be noted that there is a single hidden layer used in this investigation since more than one hidden layer usage might lead to gross over parameterisation of the model shamseldin et al 2002 but the number of intermediate cells deserves the further investigations in the following sections in this research the mle neural network expressions in the above two interconnections are described below j j f b 0 j i 1 n w i j x i 15 o f b o j 1 m w j j j j where b 0 j is the bias used from the input layer to the j th cell and b o corresponds to the bias used from the hidden layer to the single cell in the output layer w i j is the weight in the expression dealing with the interaction between i th cell in the input layer and j th cell in the hidden layer j j represents the output through the interconnection between the input and hidden layer while o is the final output in the isolated neuron in the output layer f x is the continuous and differentiable transfer function such as the hyperbolic tangent or an exponential based function to obtain something similar to the binary behaviour of the electrical brain signal like a step function for the transfer function in this work it holds the homogeneous form as that 16 f x 1 1 exp x 2 5 4 multi objective genetic algorithm moga is characterised by a fast non dominated sorting approach based on the controlled elitism concepts deb et al 2002 firstly the initial population representing the best chromosomes parents about the objective function is selected to run moga then moga is run and generates a new population called offspring via cross over and mutation for continuous parameters in the cross over process the operator linearly combines two parent chromosome vectors to produce two new offspring according to the following equations o f f s p r i n g τ p a r e n t 1 1 τ p a r e n t 2 17 o f f s p r i n g 1 τ p a r e n t 1 τ p a r e n t 2 where τ represents the cross over probability that can be described as the stability of the population the mutation alters one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial state it can result in entirely new gene values being added to the gene pool with these new gene values the genetic algorithm might be able to arrive at a better solution than was previously possible garcía martínez et al 2018 the mutation is an essential part of the genetic search as it helps prevent the population from stagnating at any local optima for continuous parameters the polynomial mutation operator eq 18 is applied to implement the mutation 18 o f f s p r i n g p a r e n t u p p e r b o u n d l o w e r b o u n d δ where δ is the mutation rate reflecting the algorithm randomness finally the design points of the new population are updated and the whole optimisation is validated for convergence in this paper the initial samples of the population and the samples per iteration were 100 the cross over probability is 0 98 and the mutation probability utilised in this work equals 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 validations of cfd simulation c d c l and the lift drag ratio obtained via cfd simulation has been made the comparisons with the experimental results as revealed in fig 9 the cfd results show the contemporary changing trend with that from wind tunnel experiments c d increases while c l increases firstly and then decreases with an increment of aoa the stall appears at the critical aoa which is 50 in cfd simulations and experiments and the maximum c l is 2 01 at the critical aoa the accurate capture of stall status approaching 70 by cfd technique indicates the critical flow separation and induced pressure declines can be correctly modelled by earsm k ϵ method in addition the maximum lift drag ratio is 3 70 experiment with aoa 15 aoa under the working conditions of the otter board working aoa was inferred ranging from 25 35 based on fishery technology practices within that range the lift drag ratio and c l are considerably high implying that the board contributes to the expansion of trawl mouth while preserving a productive efficiency hydrodynamic coefficients acquired via cfd are underestimated in the range from 0 5 5 ahead of the occurrence of stall it might be attributed to the oscillation of the otter board model in the direction perpendicular to the inflow afterwards c d and c l are over estimated when aoa is larger than 55 the significant change of the flow field around the otter board model compared with that during the unstalled situation wang et al 2020 could account for the different laws the maximum relative discrepancies between cfd and experimental results are around 11 which might be attributed to numerical diffusion of 2nd order total variation diminishing scheme with the unstructured grids 3 2 comparison of metamodeling approaches with respect to various factors affecting hydrodynamics of trawl doors it is of great significance to discuss the performances of metamodeling approaches in the second stage of the newly proposed workflow fig 6 to obtain the hydrodynamic performance of vertical cambered otter board under the working condition case of which aoa equalled 30 the mid value within the working aoa scope is chosen to train the further metamodels concerning the thickness rc and ias of deflectors considering the accuracy and refinement cost the number of the independent variables while each metamodeling should be reduced parnas et al 2003 as the number of design variables increased even the number of points required by the ccd approach might be too expensive mason et al 1998 therefore two kinds of metamodelings one for thickness rc two independent variables and the other for ias three independent variables are trained simultaneously besides the efficiency and accuracy of kriging and anns metamodelings are discussed as follows 3 2 1 efficiency the efficiency of the refinement in the post processing and the computational cost should be balanced minutely comparisons of the refinement features of kriging and anns metamodelings are illustrated in fig 10 the initial divergence means the largest discrepancy of the candidates after the initial moga between metamodelings and cfd while the number of refinement represents the necessary unqualified candidates to get the programme converged in 2 factor metamodeling the initial divergence among c d c l and c p c using kriging are all below 1 so that there is no refinement in the post processing as for anns the number of refinements reduces with the increasing of the cell number in the hidden layer and the initial diversity using 2 cell in the hidden layer of anns is the largest finally the 4 cell pattern in the hidden layer of anns get converged instantly since the initial divergences of hydrodynamic coefficients are all below 1 therefore kriging and 4 cell anns are the most efficient schemes in 2 factor metamodelings compared with the 2 factor metamodeling the 3 factor metamodeling demands more computational cost as fig 10d suggested similarly the initial divergence of the hydrodynamic coefficients based on kriging is below 1 so that the programme can be converged unconditionally as the increase of the cell number in the hidden layer of anns the refinements frequency in each anns programme show a decreasing trend and the 9 cell anns has the largest initial divergence finally the 11 cell embedded in the hidden layer of anns get converged directly since the initial divergences of hydrodynamic coefficients are all below 1 in summary kriging and 11 cell anns are demonstrated as the most efficient options in 3 factor metamodelings 3 2 2 accuracy in this section the most efficient schemes in the 2 factor and 3 factor metamodelings discussed above are used to carry out the following contents in order to describe the difference precisely between kriging and anns metamodelings embedded in our procedure we have picked up 18 cases with the largest relative difference between kriging and anns response surface regarding each hydrodynamic coefficient and divided into 6 groups as roman numeral illustrated in fig 11 i ii and iii represented c d c l and c p c of the 2 factor metamodelings respectively while iv v and vi were the results from 3 factor metamodelings to explain the accuracy of metamodeling each case has been validated and compared with the cfd simulation the detailed hydrodynamic results of the metamodelings which has been normalised with the cfd validated results are demonstrated in fig 11 and table 2 cases with the most considerable relative difference from kriging and anns metamodelings frequently appear in the boundaries of response surfaces it can be explained that the candidates satisfied the contrasts in moga are not located in the boundary area vicinities lacking the further refinements in the routine however the divergence was understandable with respect to efficiencies because the under refined areas are not the crucial regions concerning the predefined restrained conditions moreover the majority of divergences between two metamodelings is not significant for 18 cases based on the 2 factor metamodelings c d and c l of the otter board are slightly overestimated using anns while kriging methods provide more realistic predictions compared with the former furthermore the discrepancies of c p c between two methods are quite minor in short kriging methodology is more accurate in the 2 factor metamodeling compared with the 4 cell hidden layered anns yet the performances of these two methods do not show remarkable diversity as for the 3 factor metamodeling the divergence between the two methods becomes more significant than the former metamodeling the increasing complexity of dimensions and instability of hydrodynamics of the otter board should account for this situation to some degree the effects of ias on the hydrodynamics are larger than that of the thickness and rc implying the difficulties of 3 factor occasions the discrepancies of c p c between two methods are little and kriging overestimates that but anns underestimates inversely it can be concluded that both of methods can be selected to predict the responses of c p c of the otter board in 2 factor and 3 factor metamodeling c d of the otter board is overestimated using kriging while anns method using 11 cells in the hidden layer presents a more reasonable value even though both of two methods overestimate c l explicitly kriging obtains more practical values based on the reference of cfd results as a summary the response surfaces of c d built from anns are recommended to continue the subsequent studies and kriging methods are better at the response surface of c l in the category of 3 factor metamodelings 3 3 effect of deflector on the hydrodynamics of the otter board the corresponding response surfaces of c d c l and c p c are chosen following the efficiency and accuracy criterion as discussed in section 3 2 two dimensional contours are adopted to analyse visually x axis and y axis denote the independent variables and the colour illustrates response values of hydrodynamics coefficients 3 3 1 thickness and relative camber as demonstrated in fig 12 kriging method has clearly stated the effects of thickness and rc on the hydrodynamics of the otter board the varying rcs have the crucial impacts on c d c l and c p c of the otter board while the thickness shows the prominent influence on c d followed by c p c nevertheless c l is not affected by the thickness factor completely the maximum differences of the peaks and valleys in the response surfaces of c d and c l remain around 19 yet that for c p c accounts for 12 obviously the peak and valley of the thickness rc response are predominantly distributed around the boundary areas i e extreme values of the thickness or rc in detail c d holds the minimum value with the smaller rc and thickness but it shows an increasing trend with the increment of rc and thickness similarly c l tends to increase with the rc it can be seen that the relationship between c d and c l is contradictory due to the close variation patterns with rc furthermore through qualitative analysis by considering the thickness factor the working efficiency of the otter board can be improved with the smaller thickness and the larger rc as for the stability issue induced by hydrodynamics c p c is maximal as the minimum thickness and rc meaning the centre of pressure in the chord direction deviated from the geometric centre of the otter board to some extent however the position of c p c gradually moves back to the geometric centre as the increment of rc it is worthy noting that with the increasing of rc the thickness parameter illustrates less and less influence on c p c combined with the above discussions c p c is located around the trawl door centroid in the high efficient working conditions proving the rationality of the configuration about the thickness and rc of deflectors in the trawl door 3 3 2 installed angles in the three factor metamodeling it is impossible to plot the response of hydrodynamics with three ias directly for the sake of visualisation several discrete values of γ 4 7 5 and 11 are extracted then the hydrodynamic contour of α and β can be depicted with the discrete γ from fig 13 all three hydrodynamic coefficients tend to increase with the increasing of γ but the change of γ would not affect the distribution of the valley and peak in the response surface illustrating that the varied γ would not make the remarkable impact on the hydrodynamics compared with α and β with regard to c d and c p c the maximum divergences between the peak and valley of the response surface remain approximate 35 40 while 20 for c l this appears that the effect of ias on the hydrodynamics is more significant than that of thickness and rc compared to the results of 2 factor metamodeling to explain further c d obtains the maximum value when α and β are minimised and γ is maximised it is revealed that c d can be reduced sharply only if α or β is increased and the fluctuation of γ would slightly alter the values of the extremum in response surface of c d as for c l it reaches the valley of the response surface while α or β is excessively small or high but c l would be improved by 14 while δ α 20 25 δ β 5 15 and γ keeping constant around 11 associated with the metamodeling results of c d it is of great challenges to derive the optimal case regarding the working efficiency qualitatively and quantitatively due to the antagonistic facts thus moga in the following section can be employed as a complementary tool to obtain the optimal structures in terms of c p c the minimum of that is 0 35 when all ias are little meaning the position of c p c deviates from the geometric centre severely however that can be converged to the central area with the slow increment of all ias especially the location of c p c would be offset to the reversed direction on the condition that γ is larger than 7 5 for instance on the occasion when γ 11 α 37 and β 25 simultaneously c p c becomes larger than 0 5 fig 13 in other words the total reversal of the centre of pressure point position has led to unexpected outcomes for the otter board 3 4 analysis of multi objective genetic algorithm two types of response surfaces of hydrodynamics coefficients concerning thickness rc and ias are built through kriging and anns metamodelings however the cases in ias metamodeling for improving the working efficiency which is to minimise c d and improve c l are sophisticated to locate following the above discussion moga is then adopted not to find the candidate points satisfying the objective functions and limitations but rather to refine the metamodelings as the feedback in this section three candidate cases of which sequence denotes the satisfaction of pareto optimality are picked up for higher efficiency of working operations then cfd simulations are carried out to verify the availability of these candidates the mathematical constraints of the multi objective problem are developed as follows objectives minimise c d maximise c l subject to target 0 5 for c p c to remain stable of the trawl door kriging methodology is reliable with respect to efficiency and accuracy in the thickness rc 2 factor metamodeling while kriging and anns have shown varied advantages in the ias metamodeling so the latter metamodel should be discussed separately in terms of methods the results for the hydrodynamics using thickness rc kriging metamodeling are presented in table 3 and the maximum relative errors for c d c l and c p c are below 1 between cfd and rsm results furthermore the moga candidates preserve the consistency with recommended combinations in the qualitative analysis of 2 factor metamodeling which is to decrease the thickness and lift rc in spite of minor differences of the validated c d and c l between candidate 1 and 2 the c p c close to 0 5 of candidate 1 indicates a higher satisfaction for c p c objectives it is in accordance with the pareto optimality ranking theoretically confirming the effectiveness of moga for the 2 factor metamodeling therefore the optimised thickness and rc in candidate 1 and 2 are both considered to carry out the further optimisation validations concerning the ias 3 factor metamodeling two kinds of methodologies show various capacities in metamodeling as the accuracy and efficiency noted thus table 4 describes the relevant candidates using kriging and anns methods and affiliated cfd validations would ensure the accuracy of moga prediction in this programme although the variations of results still exist between two methods to some extent the distribution zones of the first two candidates are relatively close especially the same candidate for candidate 2 using kriging and candidate 3 using anns candidate 1 indicates that the combination of the maximised α and β with the medium γ can maintain the highest working efficiency compared with candidate 1 candidate 3 reveals a critical discrepancy amongst c d c l and three ias predicted through kriging and anns methods however it is justified the candidate 1 presents a better stability compared to others which is vital for the practical fishing operations for the three factor metamodeling it is rather hard to address which method is more competitive than each other in terms of high working efficiency due to the antagonistic relationship between c d and c l in brief further cfd simulation of two candidates 1 in ias metamodeling should be conducted combining with the former optimised recommendations of thicknesses and rcs 3 5 optimised results in the optimisation stage two candidates 1 in ias metamodeling with the optimised thickness and rc from two candidates claimed in section 3 4 are combined altogether to reach an optimal solution the four integrated cases are validated through cfd then compared to the original case in table 5 the subtle difference after the optimisation is attributed to the antagonistic relationship between drag and lift components it is rather challenging to locate the solutions which can meet pareto optimal front drastically but case 1 is chosen as a representative successful optimisation to give further explanations about the difference between case 1 and the prototype the observations of time averaged streamlines in the central vertical plane are extracted as presented in fig 14 a small vortex has formed in the suction side of d1 but it is not fully occupied and dominating in other words the flow is partially separated in the prototype case these phenomena can be tracked down to the fact that stall for d1 is in the developing stage pressure differences on both sides of the panels are gradually reducing which can be characterised as the drag increases slowly while the lift surges first then drops in terms of hydrodynamics schlichting and gersten 2016 therefore the optimisation has changed the flow patterns around d1 and then no flow separation occurs on the suction side meanwhile the flow distributions around the other deflectors are quite similar meaning the adjustment of all the structural factors alters the flow patterns around d1 dramatically except for others in conclusion the satisfied optimisations have been achieved following the metamodeling and cfd strategies in this work 4 conclusions and outlook a novel metamodeling integrated with computational fluid dynamics cfd and multi objective genetic algorithm moga method is proposed for the hydrodynamic optimisations of deflectors on a multi wing trawl door compared with other works combining metamodeling and moga a more strict procedure comprised of refinements as the feedback is established herein the embedded kriging and artificial neural networks anns metamodeling approaches are discussed for various optimisations the accuracy of cfd simulation using element based finite volume method ebfvm is validated successfully with wind tunnel experiments then the accuracy and efficiency features of anns and kriging methodologies are compared in the formation of 2 factor and 3 factor metamodelings based on the above discussions of methods effects of thickness relative camber and installation angles of deflectors on the hydrodynamics of this otter board are analysed and then the optimised case is obtained through moga finally the flow patterns between the original and the optimised cases are compared proving the rationality of the optimisation in a practical sense this study has provided with the novel metamodeling procedure and the reference for the optimisations of deflectors assembled on the multi wing otter board the main conclusions are drawn from the work in terms of efficiency and accuracy kriging performs better than artificial neural networks methods in 2 factor metamodeling however in the 3 factor investigation kriging is better in the lift component of hydrodynamics while artificial neural networks has more advantages in the prediction of drag the installed angles and relative cambers have the considerable impacts on the hydrodynamics of the trawl door whereas the thickness of deflectors shows the prominent influence on c d followed by c p c c l is not affected by the thickness factor totally the varying α of the d1 and β of the d2 show the remarkable impact on the hydrodynamics compared with γ of the d3 in the installed angle 3 factor metamodeling the relationship between drag and lift components is antagonistic in order to improve the working efficiency the optimal results obtained through moga are beneficial to improve the efficiency of the multi wing trawl door through flow visualisation the formation and development of the vortex on the suction side of deflectors should account for the hydrodynamic divergences between the optimised and the original otter board proving the rationality of the optimisation derived by moga the conclusions are encouraging for further investigation of the scientific configuration of deflectors from the perspective of flow patterns the installed angles present the critical impacts on the hydrodynamics but limited to the completeness of the geometry the ranges the installed angles can be enlarged without the consideration of the wing end plates especially the distances between deflectors along the transverse and longitudinal directions are a crucial topic associated with flow patterns around wings secondly the high fidelity turbulence model such as wall modelled large eddy simulation wmles or detached delayed eddy simulation ddes can be utilised to handle the high reynolds number flow separation case the above improvements are expected to derive more universal reference for the configurations of the deflectors the potential improvements of the newly proposed routine are necessary as the overlook of refinements close to the response surfaces boundaries in addition the simplification on metamodeling methods adoption and the involvement of more closure variables in a metamodeling should be required as for robustness and accuracies moreover additional cases for hydrodynamic optimisations of trawl doors can be validated following the procedure in future studies credit authorship contribution statement gang wang cfd simulation writing the original manuscript

20711,in the present work a metamodeling with computational fluid dynamics cfd method for the hydrodynamic optimisations of deflectors on the multi wing trawl door is introduced then a comparative analysis of kriging and artificial neural networks metamodeling methods is carried out using the effects of relative camber thickness and the installed angles of deflectors on the hydrodynamics as a case study for optimisations based on cfd simulations verified by the wind tunnel experiment a strict procedure including metamodeling and multi objective genetic algorithm is established efficiency and accuracy between the two methods are discussed finally this study studied the flow patterns of the optimal otter board in the higher working efficiency state the results showed that kriging performs better than artificial neural networks methods in 2 factor metamodeling however in the 3 factor investigation artificial neural networks has more advantages in the prediction of drag while kriging is better in the lift component of hydrodynamics the relative camber has the considerable impacts on the hydrodynamics of the trawl door whereas the thickness of deflectors shows the prominent influence on the resistances followed by lift forces the effect of installed angles on the hydrodynamic loadings is more remarkable than that of thickness and relative camber in flow visualisation the

introduction trawl door which is also called otter board is an essential component to facilitate the expansion of trawl mouth in the horizontal direction and its resistance accounts for 30 of the total resistance of the trawl system during the process of working hydrodynamics of the otter board and its adaptability to marine environmental protection will directly affect the efficiency of trawl catch sterling and centre 2000 therefore the improvement of hydrodynamic performance reducing the resistance and maintaining stability are the core issues in the design or optimisation of the otter board in recent years the application of the multi wing or the airfoil shaped otter board is widely accepted due to the better hydrodynamic performance compared with the traditional one panel structures as the deflectors could delay flow separation xu et al 2018 a novel hltd with the aerofoil deflectors outline was proposed aspect ratio ar and camber ratio are treated as the vital elements in improving the hydrodynamics of hltd and its actual performance had been validated and compared detailedly with the traditional cambered trawl door through cfd simulations flume experiments and sea trials you et al 2020b a discussions regarding deflectors have dominated researches about the multi wing otter board prior studies generally confirmed that the configuration of multiple deflectors with varying installed angles ias and camber ratio can improve hydrodynamic performances of the otter board wang et al 2017 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018b based on the cfd simulation and orthogonal design xu et al 2018 investigated nine factors related to hydrodynamic performances of deflectors and the otter board including ar camber ratio ias and the intervals between deflectors and the main panel then finally provided with an optimisation case as an evolution of the rectangular type otter board the hydrodynamic efficiency of vertical cambered multi wing trawl door performs better than others do the installation of deflectors or several slots on the dominant panel contributes to decreasing streamwise hydro pressure drops however the affiliated deflectors designs and optimisations are sensitive to stabilities weights and hydrodynamics affecting the actual fishing operations considerably prior researches have extensively explored the hydrodynamics of double wing otter board but few studies have targeted multi wing otter board consisting of more than two deflectors moreover a comprehensive study related to deflector structural factors are meaningful and the thickness factor was also overlooked in most hydrodynamic studies since it is relevant to the structural strength and weights the effect of thickness on the hydrodynamics of otter boards should be understood before the decision making in the engineering fields the relationships between independent variables and the corresponding dependent responses are not explicitly linear for the complicated structures as a consequence it demands great costs of time and resources to give quantitative explanations or full factor analysis despite the advancements of computational or experimental abilities kusiak et al 2015 considering the efficiency and accuracy while optimising the metamodeling or so called response surface method rsm is influential as a feasible strategy of comprehensive experimental designs and mathematical modellings rsm majors in predicting the quantitative relationship among independent variables and induced results within the global scope of design space by carrying out several tests of representative points compared with the typical experimental design for instance orthogonal design the advantages of metamodelings are to form intuitional insights about the interactions and associations between qualitative and quantitative factors considering the efficiency and accuracy fonseca et al 2003 wang et al 2014 in the optimisation procedure involved metamodeling the optimal solution can be addressed through the genetic algorithm ga at last the combination of rsm and ga has been gradually applied in the fishery engineering in recent years wang et al 2020 you et al 2020a with computational fluid dynamics cfd a shape optimisation methodology using local surrogate models for the multi element trawl door was firstly proposed by leifsson et al 2015 then multi layer feed forward network along with ga was adopted to optimise the shape of bi plane typed otter board takahashi et al 2017 proving the rationality of theoretical analysis as the continuation of this work you et al 2020a validated the results obtained from rsm and multi objective genetic algorithm moga using particle image velocimetry piv experiments proving the efficiency of this pattern besides wang et al 2020 revealed the effect of euler angles on the hydrodynamics of a vertical cambered trawl door by a strict workflow of kriging methods and moga using a constant global model and localised gaussian correction function the kriging method can yield a more accurate approximation for the general optimisations li et al 2013 and anns showed high capacities when metamodeling complex non linear functions without the need to predetermine the form of the model leshno et al 1993 in kusiak et al 2015 the authors concluded that kriging technique is less sensitive to the number of experimental points than anns approach but the latter performed better in the metamodeling and optimisations of the complex objectives to the best of authors knowledge it is evident that artificial neural networks anns and kriging methods can build meta models amongst hydrodynamic non linear variables but further efficiencies and accuracies are not addressed by comparisons besides a rigorous and universal procedure combining the above metamodeling with moga should be emphasised and validated for the optimisation the motivation for this paper is to present a metamodeling with cfd simulations section 2 3 for hydrodynamics optimisations of deflectors on a multi wing trawl door for the bottom trawling section 2 1 a strict workflow consisting of metamodeling and moga is proposed in goal handling with respect to constrains section 2 5 wherein the efficiency and accuracy of two metamodelings applied to various situations for the trawl door are compared in section 3 2 the effects of deflector on the hydrodynamic characteristics c d c l and c p c of the multi wing trawl door are studied following the above guidelines section 3 3 thickness relative camber rc and three ias are selected as the essential structural parameters of deflectors then classified into 2 factor and 3 factor metamodelings lastly we have provided the optimum cases for deflectors on the otter board inherited from the moga analysis section 3 4 and it is validated further based on flow visualisation section 3 5 2 material and methods 2 1 the otter board model the investigated otter board is a kind of vertical cambered multi wing otter board fig 1 scale ratio 1 4 following the reynolds number similarity criterion which is made of carbon structural steel q235 and painted on the surface with anti rust material and the quantitative dimensions are as illustrated in table 1 this kind of device composed of deflectors and the main panel is adopted commonly in the west africa bottom trawler with a power of 880 kw and towing speed reaches maximum 3 kn in this research the deflector camber is defined as the distance from the mid arc to the chord and rc is the ratio of the camber to the chord as fig 1 presents rc and the thickness of all the deflectors in this prototype are 12 and 3 mm separately considering the geometric completeness i e the overall geometry cannot vary greatly with deflectors of the otter board and the field production experience while trawling the adjustable range of the thickness and rc of all the deflectors are 1 mm 8 mm and 1 13 respectively ia is referred as the angle between the chord of deflector and the horizontal direction ranges for δ α δ β and δ γ are 6 37 4 25 and 2 13 respectively supposing that a larger range for the thickness rc and ias are in demand the wing end plates and other irrelevant components of the trawl door would be affected bringing in other uncertainties for the optimisation study one should be noted that the lower left corner of each deflector is fixed as the centre point then variations of ias δ ias are achieved through the rotation of each deflector around the centre point 2 2 experimental validation in order to validate the accuracy of numerical simulation the wind tunnel experiment of the otter board model is conducted in the nh 2 low speed wind tunnel located in nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics china this measurement is carried out in a small test section of which dimensions are 6 m length 3 m width 2 5 m height and the cross sectional area equals to 7 18 m2 fig 2 the otter board model and the six component mechanical tower balance are jointed with a rob connection which is used to adjust the angle of attack aoa of the model and located in the tunnel section centre region the aoa between the otter board chord and incoming flow ranges from 0 to 70 intervals of 2 5 are used for the aoa ranging of 0 50 followed by intervals of 5 ranging from 50 to 70 wind speed 28 m s is employed in this test corresponding to re 9 5 10 5 the turbulent flow regimes around and induced hydrodynamic loadings on the square plate structures are equilibrated as r e reaches super critical scope hoerner and f 1965 or so called self modelling region through the r e similarity criterion the full scale trawl door hydrodynamics with a towing speed from 0 5 3 kn for the trawler can be implied by the wind tunnel measurements with 28 m s during the test the six component tower balance remains static and the rob connection can be rotated to achieve the aoa a conversion module inside the tower balance can measure fluid dynamics indexes all tested data is performed the bracket interference correction accomplished by removing the effects of bare rob nevertheless according to the previous experience of wind tunnel test this correction method cannot altogether remove the irrelevant effects of bare rob resulting in a little error between real value and experimental value especially around small aoa vicinity the cases of which aoa equals 0 10 are discarded in the following parts 2 3 numerical modelling the numerical simulation is conducted by cfx code which uses element based finite volume method ebfvm filippini et al 2014 to solve the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations in this study 2nd order total variation diminishing scheme is used to deal with the discretisation of convective term while the standard finite element approach is adopted to deal with the diffusion term adjustable time step oscillates around 1 0 1 0 4 s during a 30s calculation assuring the courant number equals 0 75 to achieve the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition temporally and spatially the adoption of standard k ϵ turbulence model combined with the explicit algebraic reynolds stress models earsm can ensure flow modelling and induced hydrodynamic loadings accuracies at critical or super critical r e region it has been verified and compared to typical standard k ϵ model and re normalisation group rng k ϵ in wang et al 2020 coupled with earsm the reynolds stresses are modelled from the anisotropy tensor according to its definition eq 1 1 u i u j k a i j 2 3 δ i j where k is the modelled turbulent kinematic energy δ i j is the kronecker delta function while anisotropy tensor a i j in the matrix a is determined as a solution of the following quasi linear equation λ a a 1 s a ω ω a a 2 as sa 2 3 t r as 2 λ a 3 a 4 p k ϵ where s and ω represent non dimensional strain rate and vorticity tensors separately the coefficients in this matrix equation hinge on the c i coefficients of the pressure strain term in the underlying reynolds stress transport model the above constants are referred as a 1 1 245 a 2 0 a 3 1 8 a 4 2 25 p k is the production term of turbulent kinematic energy which could be integrated with ϵ turbulent dissipation rate closured by the standard k ϵ model above all the explicit anisotropy tensor a i j can be obtained based on a polynomial based on the strain rate and the vorticity tensors which has been introduced in wallin and johansson 2000 in detail the computational domain in fig 3 consists of an outer domain and a small domain embedded in the former considering the accuracy of cfd simulations it is crucial to set up an inner domain close to the structures with the finer grids capturing the largely gradient variation of flow fields around the otter board the scale of the outer computational domain is the same as the experimental wind tunnel while the inner domain is 6l length 3l width 3l height inlet and outlet are defined as the entrance of flow and exit of the computational domain in the x direction respectively moreover k and ϵ are initialised as the turbulent intensity based on the clarification of wang et al 2018a in order to facilitate comparison with the wind tunnel test the fluid media adopted in the numerical simulation is incompressible air with v 28 m s given that the fluid could discharge completely the outlet boundary is the pressure outlet with a relative pressure 0 pa besides all surfaces of the otter board and other surfaces of the domain are assumed to be the no slip walls from fig 4 the unstructured tetrahedral grids are adopted in the far field domain and the near wall region is refined with the 10 layer prismatic layers of which the first layer thickness is 1 8 10 4 m ensuring y 15 therefore wall function is also utilised for near wall treatment in the high r e separation flow the mesh convergence test is also implemented to ensure the verification of the numerical simulation of which drag and lift force are selected as the target indices it is shown in fig 5 two hydrodynamics indices get stable once the grid number reaches 4 million the deviations of the drag and lift forces among the last three cases are less than 1 therefore considering the balance of computational efficiency and accuracy the mesh patterns of which grid numbers 6 7 10 6 is chosen to continue further studies the total number of nodes and elements in each case are reported approximately 1 26 10 6 and 6 7 10 6 respectively 2 4 data statistics the time averaged drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l related to the hydrodynamics can be calculated using the experimental or simulation value of drag force f d and lift force f l presented as follows 3 c d 2 f d ρ s v 2 4 c l 2 f l ρ s v 2 where ρ is the fluid density s is the plane area of the otter board v is the incoming flow velocity the moment coefficient c m c and the centre of pressure coefficient along the chord direction c p c associated with the stability performance of the otter board while trawling were listed below 5 c m c 2 m c ρ s l v 2 6 c n c d sin a o a c l cos a o a 7 c p c e 1 m c f n l e 1 l c m c c n where c p c represents the equivalent positions of the hydrodynamics acting on the otter board in the chord direction wang et al 2020 xu et al 2017 reflecting the stability issue of structures more specifically the significant change of c p c might lead to the overturn accident of the otter board cui 1997 due to the structural symmetry of the structure it is unnecessary to derive the centre of pressure coefficient along the span 2 5 a novel metamodeling workflow with cfd simulations in this chapter a novel metamodeling workflow with simulations and moga is introduced as a feasible strategy for the optimisation of structures wherein the earsm k ϵ model is utilised embedded in design of experiments doe and refinements as demonstrated in fig 6 central composite design ccd an experimental design methodology widely used in establishing metamodelings in the process of optimisation studies selukar et al 1995 is adopted to generate design points in the whole design space the design points are used to construct response surfaces in the metamodelings finally optimisation constraints are predefined before moga and then the genetic algorithm optimiser is utilised to analyse the existing response surface in the metamodelings three candidates satisfied the contrasts are picked up from the metamodel to evaluate metamodel qualities the candidate points generated through moga should be validated via cfd simulations however the prediction accuracy using metamodeling might not be insufficient due to the limited quantities of design points the solution to this problem lies in additional refinements which are to reconstruct the response surface by increasing the unqualified candidate points produced by moga to the metamodeling then run the moga for a second time compared to that reported in wang et al 2020 this refinement in the upgraded workflow is more demand oriented as focusing on the optimisation as depicted in fig 6 the unqualified candidates via the initial moga are determined once the relative discrepancies of all targeted parameters amongst three candidates between cfd validated results with metamodeling predictions achieve 1 conversely it applies to the workflow termination as well based on this rigorous feedback the response surface accuracy can be guaranteed to a great extent 2 5 1 design of experiments ccd is an efficient means to gather more data with a few numbers of discrete design points this design method is composed of three parts 1 a full factorial or fractional factorial design 2 an additional design often a star design in which experimental points are at a distance a from its centre more usually a takes diverse values based on rotatability and orthogonality of the design and number of experiments 3 a central point lundstedt et al 1998 generally the demand for the 2 factor metamodeling points is 9 whereas 3 factor metamodeling requires 15 design cases for instance the distribution of 15 cases for ias metamodeling is illustrated as fig 7 2 5 2 kriging metamodeling initially used in aid geologists analysing mineral deposits kriging modelling can provide the linear unbiased estimation of the intermediate and unknown values in a limited space by taking the information from some neighbouring points instead of full factor cases gano et al 2006 the ordinary kriging model adopted in this paper is clarified below 8 y x f x z x where y x is the unknown target function representing the interest response point f x is the low order polynomial function representing the global approximation of the response surface the stochastic term z x indicating the local behaviour of model is shown as follows 9 z x i 1 n λ i r x i x in addition z x obeys gauss stochastic distribution with zero mean and covariance 10 c o v z x i z x j σ 2 r r x i x j where σ 2 represents the variable of z x r is a symmetric correlation matrix with ones along diagonal of which dimension is n 0 n 0 and r x i x j is the gaussian spatial correction function between any two of the n 0 sample point presented as follows 11 r x i x j exp k 1 m θ k x k i x k j 2 where m is the number of the design variables adopted in doe θ k is the unknown coefficient of correction furthermore σ is the function of θ k x k i and x k j are the k th components of the sample points x i and x j separately predicted estimates y ˆ x of the real values y x at the untested points x is given by 12 y ˆ β ˆ r t x r 1 y f β ˆ 13 r t x r x x 1 r x x 2 r x x n 0 to solve the eq 11 θ k can be evaluated by solving the maximum likelihood estimation mle equations maximising the log likelihood function shown in eq 14 in summary the kriging model can be determined once the θ k is given 14 maximise n 0 ln σ 2 ln r θ k 2 subject to 0 θ k 2 5 3 artificial neural networks metamodeling anns are quite highly efficient computational tools to predict the distribution patterns of the outputs based on the inputs indeed this method uses a limited number of design points to build the approximation its original mechanism is to mimic the computational skills of the interconnected neurons in the brain as one of the most widely adopted algorithms among the anns multi layer feed forward neural network combined with the back propagation deep learning strategy rumelhart et al 1986 was utilised in this research the structure of the multi layer feed forward neural network is composed of three layers as fig 8 illustrates the input layer the hidden layer the output layer and the neighbouring interconnections generally the input layer contains many neurons of which number is consistent with that of design variables the objective in the input layer is to receive and transform into the input variables via the varying weights and an identity transfer function secondly each of the cells in the input layer can be exported unidirectionally to all neurons through the interconnections in the following hidden layer in the hidden layer the capabilities of anns can be enhanced to deal robustly and efficiently with inherently complex non linear relations between the inputs and the outputs of the network medsker 1994 the dominating feature of the hidden layer is to assign various weights to cells and complete the summation of the former through the transfer function the weighting is issued from an algorithm that minimises as the least squares method the distance between the interpolation and the known values design points in addition a successful learning lies in the bias introduced prior to each layer shifting the activation function through a trainable constant finally the output obtained via the above process can be exported to a single cell in the output layer shora et al 2018 it should be noted that there is a single hidden layer used in this investigation since more than one hidden layer usage might lead to gross over parameterisation of the model shamseldin et al 2002 but the number of intermediate cells deserves the further investigations in the following sections in this research the mle neural network expressions in the above two interconnections are described below j j f b 0 j i 1 n w i j x i 15 o f b o j 1 m w j j j j where b 0 j is the bias used from the input layer to the j th cell and b o corresponds to the bias used from the hidden layer to the single cell in the output layer w i j is the weight in the expression dealing with the interaction between i th cell in the input layer and j th cell in the hidden layer j j represents the output through the interconnection between the input and hidden layer while o is the final output in the isolated neuron in the output layer f x is the continuous and differentiable transfer function such as the hyperbolic tangent or an exponential based function to obtain something similar to the binary behaviour of the electrical brain signal like a step function for the transfer function in this work it holds the homogeneous form as that 16 f x 1 1 exp x 2 5 4 multi objective genetic algorithm moga is characterised by a fast non dominated sorting approach based on the controlled elitism concepts deb et al 2002 firstly the initial population representing the best chromosomes parents about the objective function is selected to run moga then moga is run and generates a new population called offspring via cross over and mutation for continuous parameters in the cross over process the operator linearly combines two parent chromosome vectors to produce two new offspring according to the following equations o f f s p r i n g τ p a r e n t 1 1 τ p a r e n t 2 17 o f f s p r i n g 1 τ p a r e n t 1 τ p a r e n t 2 where τ represents the cross over probability that can be described as the stability of the population the mutation alters one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial state it can result in entirely new gene values being added to the gene pool with these new gene values the genetic algorithm might be able to arrive at a better solution than was previously possible garcía martínez et al 2018 the mutation is an essential part of the genetic search as it helps prevent the population from stagnating at any local optima for continuous parameters the polynomial mutation operator eq 18 is applied to implement the mutation 18 o f f s p r i n g p a r e n t u p p e r b o u n d l o w e r b o u n d δ where δ is the mutation rate reflecting the algorithm randomness finally the design points of the new population are updated and the whole optimisation is validated for convergence in this paper the initial samples of the population and the samples per iteration were 100 the cross over probability is 0 98 and the mutation probability utilised in this work equals 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 validations of cfd simulation c d c l and the lift drag ratio obtained via cfd simulation has been made the comparisons with the experimental results as revealed in fig 9 the cfd results show the contemporary changing trend with that from wind tunnel experiments c d increases while c l increases firstly and then decreases with an increment of aoa the stall appears at the critical aoa which is 50 in cfd simulations and experiments and the maximum c l is 2 01 at the critical aoa the accurate capture of stall status approaching 70 by cfd technique indicates the critical flow separation and induced pressure declines can be correctly modelled by earsm k ϵ method in addition the maximum lift drag ratio is 3 70 experiment with aoa 15 aoa under the working conditions of the otter board working aoa was inferred ranging from 25 35 based on fishery technology practices within that range the lift drag ratio and c l are considerably high implying that the board contributes to the expansion of trawl mouth while preserving a productive efficiency hydrodynamic coefficients acquired via cfd are underestimated in the range from 0 5 5 ahead of the occurrence of stall it might be attributed to the oscillation of the otter board model in the direction perpendicular to the inflow afterwards c d and c l are over estimated when aoa is larger than 55 the significant change of the flow field around the otter board model compared with that during the unstalled situation wang et al 2020 could account for the different laws the maximum relative discrepancies between cfd and experimental results are around 11 which might be attributed to numerical diffusion of 2nd order total variation diminishing scheme with the unstructured grids 3 2 comparison of metamodeling approaches with respect to various factors affecting hydrodynamics of trawl doors it is of great significance to discuss the performances of metamodeling approaches in the second stage of the newly proposed workflow fig 6 to obtain the hydrodynamic performance of vertical cambered otter board under the working condition case of which aoa equalled 30 the mid value within the working aoa scope is chosen to train the further metamodels concerning the thickness rc and ias of deflectors considering the accuracy and refinement cost the number of the independent variables while each metamodeling should be reduced parnas et al 2003 as the number of design variables increased even the number of points required by the ccd approach might be too expensive mason et al 1998 therefore two kinds of metamodelings one for thickness rc two independent variables and the other for ias three independent variables are trained simultaneously besides the efficiency and accuracy of kriging and anns metamodelings are discussed as follows 3 2 1 efficiency the efficiency of the refinement in the post processing and the computational cost should be balanced minutely comparisons of the refinement features of kriging and anns metamodelings are illustrated in fig 10 the initial divergence means the largest discrepancy of the candidates after the initial moga between metamodelings and cfd while the number of refinement represents the necessary unqualified candidates to get the programme converged in 2 factor metamodeling the initial divergence among c d c l and c p c using kriging are all below 1 so that there is no refinement in the post processing as for anns the number of refinements reduces with the increasing of the cell number in the hidden layer and the initial diversity using 2 cell in the hidden layer of anns is the largest finally the 4 cell pattern in the hidden layer of anns get converged instantly since the initial divergences of hydrodynamic coefficients are all below 1 therefore kriging and 4 cell anns are the most efficient schemes in 2 factor metamodelings compared with the 2 factor metamodeling the 3 factor metamodeling demands more computational cost as fig 10d suggested similarly the initial divergence of the hydrodynamic coefficients based on kriging is below 1 so that the programme can be converged unconditionally as the increase of the cell number in the hidden layer of anns the refinements frequency in each anns programme show a decreasing trend and the 9 cell anns has the largest initial divergence finally the 11 cell embedded in the hidden layer of anns get converged directly since the initial divergences of hydrodynamic coefficients are all below 1 in summary kriging and 11 cell anns are demonstrated as the most efficient options in 3 factor metamodelings 3 2 2 accuracy in this section the most efficient schemes in the 2 factor and 3 factor metamodelings discussed above are used to carry out the following contents in order to describe the difference precisely between kriging and anns metamodelings embedded in our procedure we have picked up 18 cases with the largest relative difference between kriging and anns response surface regarding each hydrodynamic coefficient and divided into 6 groups as roman numeral illustrated in fig 11 i ii and iii represented c d c l and c p c of the 2 factor metamodelings respectively while iv v and vi were the results from 3 factor metamodelings to explain the accuracy of metamodeling each case has been validated and compared with the cfd simulation the detailed hydrodynamic results of the metamodelings which has been normalised with the cfd validated results are demonstrated in fig 11 and table 2 cases with the most considerable relative difference from kriging and anns metamodelings frequently appear in the boundaries of response surfaces it can be explained that the candidates satisfied the contrasts in moga are not located in the boundary area vicinities lacking the further refinements in the routine however the divergence was understandable with respect to efficiencies because the under refined areas are not the crucial regions concerning the predefined restrained conditions moreover the majority of divergences between two metamodelings is not significant for 18 cases based on the 2 factor metamodelings c d and c l of the otter board are slightly overestimated using anns while kriging methods provide more realistic predictions compared with the former furthermore the discrepancies of c p c between two methods are quite minor in short kriging methodology is more accurate in the 2 factor metamodeling compared with the 4 cell hidden layered anns yet the performances of these two methods do not show remarkable diversity as for the 3 factor metamodeling the divergence between the two methods becomes more significant than the former metamodeling the increasing complexity of dimensions and instability of hydrodynamics of the otter board should account for this situation to some degree the effects of ias on the hydrodynamics are larger than that of the thickness and rc implying the difficulties of 3 factor occasions the discrepancies of c p c between two methods are little and kriging overestimates that but anns underestimates inversely it can be concluded that both of methods can be selected to predict the responses of c p c of the otter board in 2 factor and 3 factor metamodeling c d of the otter board is overestimated using kriging while anns method using 11 cells in the hidden layer presents a more reasonable value even though both of two methods overestimate c l explicitly kriging obtains more practical values based on the reference of cfd results as a summary the response surfaces of c d built from anns are recommended to continue the subsequent studies and kriging methods are better at the response surface of c l in the category of 3 factor metamodelings 3 3 effect of deflector on the hydrodynamics of the otter board the corresponding response surfaces of c d c l and c p c are chosen following the efficiency and accuracy criterion as discussed in section 3 2 two dimensional contours are adopted to analyse visually x axis and y axis denote the independent variables and the colour illustrates response values of hydrodynamics coefficients 3 3 1 thickness and relative camber as demonstrated in fig 12 kriging method has clearly stated the effects of thickness and rc on the hydrodynamics of the otter board the varying rcs have the crucial impacts on c d c l and c p c of the otter board while the thickness shows the prominent influence on c d followed by c p c nevertheless c l is not affected by the thickness factor completely the maximum differences of the peaks and valleys in the response surfaces of c d and c l remain around 19 yet that for c p c accounts for 12 obviously the peak and valley of the thickness rc response are predominantly distributed around the boundary areas i e extreme values of the thickness or rc in detail c d holds the minimum value with the smaller rc and thickness but it shows an increasing trend with the increment of rc and thickness similarly c l tends to increase with the rc it can be seen that the relationship between c d and c l is contradictory due to the close variation patterns with rc furthermore through qualitative analysis by considering the thickness factor the working efficiency of the otter board can be improved with the smaller thickness and the larger rc as for the stability issue induced by hydrodynamics c p c is maximal as the minimum thickness and rc meaning the centre of pressure in the chord direction deviated from the geometric centre of the otter board to some extent however the position of c p c gradually moves back to the geometric centre as the increment of rc it is worthy noting that with the increasing of rc the thickness parameter illustrates less and less influence on c p c combined with the above discussions c p c is located around the trawl door centroid in the high efficient working conditions proving the rationality of the configuration about the thickness and rc of deflectors in the trawl door 3 3 2 installed angles in the three factor metamodeling it is impossible to plot the response of hydrodynamics with three ias directly for the sake of visualisation several discrete values of γ 4 7 5 and 11 are extracted then the hydrodynamic contour of α and β can be depicted with the discrete γ from fig 13 all three hydrodynamic coefficients tend to increase with the increasing of γ but the change of γ would not affect the distribution of the valley and peak in the response surface illustrating that the varied γ would not make the remarkable impact on the hydrodynamics compared with α and β with regard to c d and c p c the maximum divergences between the peak and valley of the response surface remain approximate 35 40 while 20 for c l this appears that the effect of ias on the hydrodynamics is more significant than that of thickness and rc compared to the results of 2 factor metamodeling to explain further c d obtains the maximum value when α and β are minimised and γ is maximised it is revealed that c d can be reduced sharply only if α or β is increased and the fluctuation of γ would slightly alter the values of the extremum in response surface of c d as for c l it reaches the valley of the response surface while α or β is excessively small or high but c l would be improved by 14 while δ α 20 25 δ β 5 15 and γ keeping constant around 11 associated with the metamodeling results of c d it is of great challenges to derive the optimal case regarding the working efficiency qualitatively and quantitatively due to the antagonistic facts thus moga in the following section can be employed as a complementary tool to obtain the optimal structures in terms of c p c the minimum of that is 0 35 when all ias are little meaning the position of c p c deviates from the geometric centre severely however that can be converged to the central area with the slow increment of all ias especially the location of c p c would be offset to the reversed direction on the condition that γ is larger than 7 5 for instance on the occasion when γ 11 α 37 and β 25 simultaneously c p c becomes larger than 0 5 fig 13 in other words the total reversal of the centre of pressure point position has led to unexpected outcomes for the otter board 3 4 analysis of multi objective genetic algorithm two types of response surfaces of hydrodynamics coefficients concerning thickness rc and ias are built through kriging and anns metamodelings however the cases in ias metamodeling for improving the working efficiency which is to minimise c d and improve c l are sophisticated to locate following the above discussion moga is then adopted not to find the candidate points satisfying the objective functions and limitations but rather to refine the metamodelings as the feedback in this section three candidate cases of which sequence denotes the satisfaction of pareto optimality are picked up for higher efficiency of working operations then cfd simulations are carried out to verify the availability of these candidates the mathematical constraints of the multi objective problem are developed as follows objectives minimise c d maximise c l subject to target 0 5 for c p c to remain stable of the trawl door kriging methodology is reliable with respect to efficiency and accuracy in the thickness rc 2 factor metamodeling while kriging and anns have shown varied advantages in the ias metamodeling so the latter metamodel should be discussed separately in terms of methods the results for the hydrodynamics using thickness rc kriging metamodeling are presented in table 3 and the maximum relative errors for c d c l and c p c are below 1 between cfd and rsm results furthermore the moga candidates preserve the consistency with recommended combinations in the qualitative analysis of 2 factor metamodeling which is to decrease the thickness and lift rc in spite of minor differences of the validated c d and c l between candidate 1 and 2 the c p c close to 0 5 of candidate 1 indicates a higher satisfaction for c p c objectives it is in accordance with the pareto optimality ranking theoretically confirming the effectiveness of moga for the 2 factor metamodeling therefore the optimised thickness and rc in candidate 1 and 2 are both considered to carry out the further optimisation validations concerning the ias 3 factor metamodeling two kinds of methodologies show various capacities in metamodeling as the accuracy and efficiency noted thus table 4 describes the relevant candidates using kriging and anns methods and affiliated cfd validations would ensure the accuracy of moga prediction in this programme although the variations of results still exist between two methods to some extent the distribution zones of the first two candidates are relatively close especially the same candidate for candidate 2 using kriging and candidate 3 using anns candidate 1 indicates that the combination of the maximised α and β with the medium γ can maintain the highest working efficiency compared with candidate 1 candidate 3 reveals a critical discrepancy amongst c d c l and three ias predicted through kriging and anns methods however it is justified the candidate 1 presents a better stability compared to others which is vital for the practical fishing operations for the three factor metamodeling it is rather hard to address which method is more competitive than each other in terms of high working efficiency due to the antagonistic relationship between c d and c l in brief further cfd simulation of two candidates 1 in ias metamodeling should be conducted combining with the former optimised recommendations of thicknesses and rcs 3 5 optimised results in the optimisation stage two candidates 1 in ias metamodeling with the optimised thickness and rc from two candidates claimed in section 3 4 are combined altogether to reach an optimal solution the four integrated cases are validated through cfd then compared to the original case in table 5 the subtle difference after the optimisation is attributed to the antagonistic relationship between drag and lift components it is rather challenging to locate the solutions which can meet pareto optimal front drastically but case 1 is chosen as a representative successful optimisation to give further explanations about the difference between case 1 and the prototype the observations of time averaged streamlines in the central vertical plane are extracted as presented in fig 14 a small vortex has formed in the suction side of d1 but it is not fully occupied and dominating in other words the flow is partially separated in the prototype case these phenomena can be tracked down to the fact that stall for d1 is in the developing stage pressure differences on both sides of the panels are gradually reducing which can be characterised as the drag increases slowly while the lift surges first then drops in terms of hydrodynamics schlichting and gersten 2016 therefore the optimisation has changed the flow patterns around d1 and then no flow separation occurs on the suction side meanwhile the flow distributions around the other deflectors are quite similar meaning the adjustment of all the structural factors alters the flow patterns around d1 dramatically except for others in conclusion the satisfied optimisations have been achieved following the metamodeling and cfd strategies in this work 4 conclusions and outlook a novel metamodeling integrated with computational fluid dynamics cfd and multi objective genetic algorithm moga method is proposed for the hydrodynamic optimisations of deflectors on a multi wing trawl door compared with other works combining metamodeling and moga a more strict procedure comprised of refinements as the feedback is established herein the embedded kriging and artificial neural networks anns metamodeling approaches are discussed for various optimisations the accuracy of cfd simulation using element based finite volume method ebfvm is validated successfully with wind tunnel experiments then the accuracy and efficiency features of anns and kriging methodologies are compared in the formation of 2 factor and 3 factor metamodelings based on the above discussions of methods effects of thickness relative camber and installation angles of deflectors on the hydrodynamics of this otter board are analysed and then the optimised case is obtained through moga finally the flow patterns between the original and the optimised cases are compared proving the rationality of the optimisation in a practical sense this study has provided with the novel metamodeling procedure and the reference for the optimisations of deflectors assembled on the multi wing otter board the main conclusions are drawn from the work in terms of efficiency and accuracy kriging performs better than artificial neural networks methods in 2 factor metamodeling however in the 3 factor investigation kriging is better in the lift component of hydrodynamics while artificial neural networks has more advantages in the prediction of drag the installed angles and relative cambers have the considerable impacts on the hydrodynamics of the trawl door whereas the thickness of deflectors shows the prominent influence on c d followed by c p c c l is not affected by the thickness factor totally the varying α of the d1 and β of the d2 show the remarkable impact on the hydrodynamics compared with γ of the d3 in the installed angle 3 factor metamodeling the relationship between drag and lift components is antagonistic in order to improve the working efficiency the optimal results obtained through moga are beneficial to improve the efficiency of the multi wing trawl door through flow visualisation the formation and development of the vortex on the suction side of deflectors should account for the hydrodynamic divergences between the optimised and the original otter board proving the rationality of the optimisation derived by moga the conclusions are encouraging for further investigation of the scientific configuration of deflectors from the perspective of flow patterns the installed angles present the critical impacts on the hydrodynamics but limited to the completeness of the geometry the ranges the installed angles can be enlarged without the consideration of the wing end plates especially the distances between deflectors along the transverse and longitudinal directions are a crucial topic associated with flow patterns around wings secondly the high fidelity turbulence model such as wall modelled large eddy simulation wmles or detached delayed eddy simulation ddes can be utilised to handle the high reynolds number flow separation case the above improvements are expected to derive more universal reference for the configurations of the deflectors the potential improvements of the newly proposed routine are necessary as the overlook of refinements close to the response surfaces boundaries in addition the simplification on metamodeling methods adoption and the involvement of more closure variables in a metamodeling should be required as for robustness and accuracies moreover additional cases for hydrodynamic optimisations of trawl doors can be validated following the procedure in future studies credit authorship contribution statement gang wang cfd simulation writing the original manuscript

20712,floating production storage and offloading fpso platforms are among the most important platforms in the offshore oil and gas industry these platforms are generally anchored to the seabed through mooring lines usually the fpso and the oil tanker are nearby before starting the offloading operation in this research the hydrodynamic interactions between a turret moored fpso and shuttle tanker were examined using the boundary element method for coupled time domain dynamic analyses to apply the sea conditions the environmental conditions of the caspian sea were considered in this regard considering the values of hydrodynamic forces on the shuttle tanker the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the most appropriate vertical position of the shuttle tanker in the vicinity of fpso therefore 19 vertical center to center distances with steps of 20 m from 80 m to 440 m were considered between the two vessels a comprehensive assessment of the dynamic responses of the two floating vessels was then conducted at different angular positions of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso the numerical results indicated that the minimum hydrodynamic force was applied to the shuttle tanker for the distance of 400 m between the centers of the vessels also the 60 degree position of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso within a 400 m radius was the most critical position in terms

natural gas lng as the most important sources of energy for humans stranded oil and gas fields in the seas and oceans have received more attention typically these fields are situated in deep waters and isolated from onshore infrastructure or other offshore pipelines this makes their exploitation challenging thus the floating production storage and offloading fpso system is the right choice due to the lack of need for piping zhao et al 2013 iran is ranked second in the world with about 34 trillion cubic meters of natural gas reserves iran is also ranked among the top five countries in the world in terms of oil reserves it is worth noting that most of these resources are located in the seas of this country therefore extracting these precious reserves is critical for the development and prosperity of the country in this regard it is worth mentioning that the northern iran s caspian sea has significant non extracted oil and gas reserves the caspian sea as the world s largest lake is 220 550 km wide and 1200 km long with an area of 436 000 km2 and the volume of more than 77 000 km3 alamian et al 2017a 2017b the water depth in various parts of the caspian sea is as follows 10 12 m in the northern part 770 m in the middle part and 1000 m in the deepest point of the southern part zeraatgar and hajiarab 2003 fig 1 shows the characteristic wave height with a 100 year return period for the northern and southern parts of the caspian sea region there are many offshore applications today where two or more floating bodies in close proximity of each other encounter substantial interactions hence it is necessary to investigate the hydrodynamic interactions of several bodies so that the effect of the flow field from one structure on another can be investigated the magnitude of hydrodynamic effects between several floating bodies in given sea conditions depends on the relative dimensions of the floating bodies and their separation distances ghafari et al 2019 chen and fang utilized three dimensional potential flow theory based on the source distribution method to analyze the hydrodynamic issues of two moving ships in waves the results revealed that the coupled resonance peaks appeared smaller this means that the standing wave generated between the two ships is not completely trapped they also showed that the roll motion in the waves decreased significantly with speed heave and pitch motions also decreased as the speed in the quartering waves increased while the sway motion increased chen and fang 2001 kim et al used a linearized three dimensional potential theory to perform numerical calculations for twelve coupled linear motion responses and relative motions between lng carrier fpso as well as various side by side positions of lng carrier at different angles of wave collision the results showed that resonance behavior and sheltering influence on the coupled motion responses as well as relative motions would result in a dangerous situation during the offloading operation kim et al 2003 zhao et al examined the hydrodynamic interactions between the flng vessel and lng carrier in the side by side arrangement using the simo code to explain and compare the hydrodynamic influences of the two vessels numerical simulations were conducted under similar environmental conditions without considering the hydrodynamic interactions the results showed that hydrodynamic interactions played a substantial role in the low frequency motion responses as well as the loads in the connecting systems zhao et al 2012 zhao et al examined the lng offloading operation between the flng vessel and the lng carrier attached to the flng s stern with tandem configuration analysis of the time domain was carried out to examine the hydrodynamic effects for two mooring types of the single mooring hawser and double mooring hawser links the results indicated that the double hawser link provided a more stable behavior for vessels than the single hawser link in the tandem offloading operation due to its higher lateral stiffness zhao et al 2013 yuan et al used a 3d rankine source code to analyze the effects of hydrodynamic interactions between two ships with the side by side configuration in shallow water their results indicated that hydrodynamic interactions in the beam sea condition were very significant besides by altering the distance between the two vessels the resonant frequency was significantly affected yuan et al 2014 yuan et al used the mhydro program based on the 3d rankin source method to study multi body hydrodynamic interactions during shallow water overtaking operation assessment of the obtained results against experimental data as well as computational fluid dynamics cfd data revealed that the developed model was suitable for predicting hydrodynamic interactions between two ships traveling with different speeds in confined waters yuan et al 2015 yuan et al studied the hydrodynamic interactions of two ships traveling in waves theoretically based on the far field wave patterns and numerically based on the three dimensional panel method using rankine green function the results showed that there was an enormous difference between theoretical and numerical calculations particularly in the low frequency range yuan et al 2016 abyn et al investigated the hydrodynamic interactions of the semi submersible platform and the tension leg platform tlp for obtaining relative surge heave and pitch motions in regular waves it was shown that the waves nonlinearity increased the amplitude of the oscillations of the semi submersible platform within the natural frequency range abyn et al 2016 wnęk et al used a cfd code to evaluate hydrodynamic interactions between two vessels a tanker and a tug configured parallel to each other at different lateral distances and two water depths for four separate flow models their results indicated that the viscosity effect on the computations was relatively small whereas the wave making effects could be substantial wnęk et al 2018 jin et al used the viscous unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes approach to analyze ship to ship interactions in regular waves the results indicated that as the frequency of the incident wave approached the natural frequency of motion for both lng carrier and flng vessel the gap wave resonance induced a pronounced change in wave forces on vessels at varying degrees of freedom dofs jin et al 2018 ghafari et al analyzed the influences of various distances on diffraction and froude krylov forces between the centers of amirkabir semi submersible and the mono column fpso platforms the results showed when the center to center distance of the structures increased no significant effect on the froude krylov force was observed while the maximum peak of diffraction force increased ghafari et al 2019 xu et al examined the interactions between the fpso and shuttle tanker during side by side offloading considering that the drafts of the two vessels change accordingly during the transfer operation the results showed that by reducing the draft the heave and roll added masses of the fpso increased thus the empty load condition has the highest roll and heave added masses xu et al 2019 tang et al simulated the coupled motions and hydrodynamic interactions between the wigley hull ship and the rectangular barge with the side by side configuration in beam sea waves using the 3d green function method in addition the parallel coupled motions of two other ships a supply ship and a frigate in a side by side configuration and with the same forward speed were also estimated a comparison of experimental and numerical results showed that the time domain hybrid green function method was effective for the coupled motions of the two adjacent ships in waves tang et al 2020 the second order hydrodynamic force on fixed and floating cylinders with a tandem arrangement was determined by motallebi et al the findings demonstrated that the existence of a fixed cylinder had a clear increasing effect on the second order forces in that the force in the heave direction increased by up to 1 55 times for a significant parameter of the floating cylinder motallebi et al 2020 coupled dynamic analysis was conducted in this paper to evaluate the responses of a fully loaded turret moored fpso and ballast loaded shuttle tanker the hydrodynamic performance of the vessels was studied in a deepwater location under the caspian sea environmental conditions through numerical simulations using the boundary element method bem although first order forces account for a large share of wave forces in some cases the nonlinear effects of waves and second order wave forces cannot be ignored ghafari et al 2019 in this paper using first and second order wave forces hydrodynamic interactions between two floating vessels were calculated using three dimensional theories of radiation diffraction the primary aim of this research is to examine different distances between the centers of the turret moored fpso and shuttle tanker to obtain the optimum distance before starting the offloading operation and then examining different angular positions of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso and different wavelengths in second order stokes waves at the optimum distance the effects of hydrodynamic interactions on the vessels multi body analysis mooring lines tensions and their dynamic coupling effects were also thoroughly considered 2 features of vessels in this paper a numerical simulation of hydrodynamic interactions between the fpso and shuttle tanker was carried out at various shuttle tanker positions relative to fpso under the environmental conditions of the caspian sea to conduct hydrodynamic analysis a significant wave height of 8 m and a wave period of 9 4 s were considered see fig 1 ghafari et al 2019 the analysis was carried in a water depth of 1000 m 2 1 fpso vessel the fpso considered in this paper has a simple rectangular body with a box shaped middle cross section the fpso has a bilge keel with a width of 1 m and length of 120 m fpso was first proposed as part of the planned development in the gulf of mexico in water depths of 1000 2000 m lopez et al 2017 the geometrical specifications of the fpso are shown in table 1 2 1 1 turret mooring system the fpso has an inner turret mooring system with a prototype diameter of 12 m consisting of nine mooring lines and six risers the vertical position of the turret center is 30 m behind the forward perpendicular lopez et al 2017 the role of the turret is to create the tie in mechanism for the fpso and it enables the body to yaw relative to the mooring lines and risers lopez et al 2017 the mooring line system has nine lines in three groups each with three lines in a symmetrical layout separated from each other with 120 the individual lines are similar and each consists of three chain cable chain segments each line in a group is separated from the adjacent line by five degrees six steel catenary risers scrs were designed in a simple symmetrical layout the risers were organized into three groups separated from each other with 120 lopez et al 2017 the turret is designed in such a way that in severe weather conditions it disconnects itself from the floater and reconnects with the floater afterwards therefore it is suitable for the caspian sea environmental conditions the details of fpso mooring lines and risers are also presented in tables 2 and 3 2 2 shuttle tanker in this paper a ballast load condition with a displacement of 31 143 tonnes and a draft of 8 5 m from the keel was considered for the shuttle tanker xu et al 2019 the geometrical specifications of the shuttle tanker are given in table 4 fig 2 also shows a view of the vessels in the software 3 governing equations 3 1 theory of three dimensional diffraction analysis of boundary element the wave force in the wave diffraction theory is calculated as the pressure integral on the wetted body surface such a method can be utilized in cases where the object dimensions are large in comparison with the wave motion amplitude and the forces caused by the fluid s viscosity can be ignored also where the dimensions of the object are sufficiently big compared to the sea wavelength such that they influence the surrounding wave field related to the waves diffraction radiation bae et al 2017 the linear superposition theorem can be utilized for formulating the velocity potential in the fluid domain because the first order potential theory of diffraction and radiation waves is utilized here for the analysis of diffraction radiation the fluid flow field encircling a floating body can be expressed as follows using the velocity potential barltrop 1998 1 φ x t a w φ x e i w t in which a w represents the amplitude of the incident wave and ω gives the frequency of the wave in eq 1 the time independent term ϕ x can be divided into three portions including the potential of radiation wave ϕ r the potential of diffracted wave ϕ d and the potential of incident wave ϕ i although the potential functions are complex the resulting physical quantities including body motions in the analysis of time domain and fluid pressure are calculated via taking only the real part into account the velocity potential in terms of the contributions of the radiation diffraction and incident waves can be expressed as 2 φ x e i ω t φ i φ d 6 j 1 φ r j x j e i ω t in which ϕ r j is the potential of radiation wave related to j th motion the fluid flow in the diffraction theory is represented by the potential flow function and thus this function should be used in the laplace equation besides boundary conditions should also be met with these portions the body surface boundary condition the free water surface and seabed boundary conditions and the infinite boundary condition tafazzoli et al 2021 by employing the linear hydrodynamic theory accounting for the radiation and diffraction waves effects and considering an ideal fluid assumption and assuming the existence of a velocity potential function φ x t including the space

floating structures by applying restoring forces to the horizontal plane the mooring system controls motions in the surge sway and yaw dofs tafazzoli et al 2021 fig 3 gives a view of an individual mooring line which is modeled as a chain subjected to the external forces using the morison element fig 4 presents an element of a circular cable on which some structural inertia forces and external

conditions the boundary element method has been used for numerical simulation in the boundary element method by considering the boundary conditions and developing the laplace equation the potential function is obtained in the software the model of diffraction panels is used for large cross section parts of the vessel and the morison element for small cross section components each individual mooring line is also modeled as a set of morison elements considering the conditions for applying the morison equation the effects of viscosity are significant however in the theory of diffraction fluid is considered non viscous at low wave frequencies viscous forces create drift forces in addition to damping in which case the viscous damping term is taken into account tafazzoli et al 2021 4 1 mesh generation in the boundary element software according to the desired accuracy it is only necessary to enter the size of the elements for mesh generation of course at this stage it should be noted that the maximum mesh frequency does not exceed the maximum wave frequency since this will lead to wrong answers tafazzoli and shafaghat 2019 also a finer mesh size increases both accuracy and computation time 4 1 1 mesh independence study fig 5 provides a view of the meshed vessels in the software moreover tables 5 and 6 display the size and number of mesh elements for the shuttle tanker and fpso respectively for the independence of the numerical solution from the mesh size the sway response amplitude operators raos of the shuttle tanker and fpso for different mesh sizes are shown in fig 6 a and b as can be seen in table 5 and fig 6a the shuttle tanker s sway response amplitude operator does not change from the 4th mesh size onwards therefore the mesh size is considered as 1 8 m for the shuttle tanker it can also be seen from table 6 and fig 6b that the fpso s sway response amplitude operators are the same for types 4 and 5 namely mesh sizes of 2 m and 1 8 m therefore the mesh of 1 8 m is chosen for both vessels taking into account the above discussion 4 2 validation in order to validate the numerical results of the fpso the results of an experimental study performed on a 1 64 scale fpso model in the wave tank of shanghai jiao tong university china were used fig 7 a lopez et al 2017 also the results of an experimental study on a 1 80 scale shuttle tanker model in the wave tank of jiangsu university china were used to validate the numerical results of the shuttle tanker fig 7b xu et al 2019 in this regard to confirm the results of this analysis three response amplitude operators were compared with the previous experimental results it should be noted that validation was carried out for the fully loaded fpso and the half loaded shuttle tanker under the imposed head sea conditions the vessels specifications are shown in tables 1 and 4 fig 8 a and b shows a comparison between the experimental and numerical performances of the fpso and shuttle tanker respectively as can be seen in fig 8 the experimental and numerical results agree well 5 results and discussion 5 1 the most suitable relative distance of vessels to select the best center to center distance between the vessels in the direction of beam sea waves the diffraction forces applied to the shuttle tanker in six dofs were examined at 19 distances with 20 m steps from 80 to 440 m see fig 9 finally the distance with the minimum diffraction force on the shuttle tanker was chosen in this research the forward speed of the shuttle tanker was zero it should be mentioned that increasing the distance between the centers of the two vessels does not have a significant effect on the froud krylov forces ghafari et al 2019 and thus these forces were not evaluated in this section 5 1 1 diffraction forces in linear motions as previously described the fpso s body alters the surrounding flow field therefore diffraction forces applied to the shuttle tanker were determined fig 10 illustrates the maximum hydrodynamic forces on the tanker in three linear dofs of surge sway and heave motions according to fig 10a the maximum diffraction force occurred in the surge direction at the distance of 200 m with an increase of 1 11 times relative to the force at the initial position of the tanker the distance of 80 m the minimum diffraction force applied to the tanker in the surge direction occurred when the center to center distance between the two vessels was about 300 m showing a 0 38 times decrease compared to the maximum applied force in the sway dof fig 10b the minimum diffraction force occurred at the distance of 280 m which was 0 61 times that at the initial position when the distance between the two vessels was raised to 320 m the force reached its maximum value which was twice the minimum value as can be seen in fig 10c the diffraction force in heave direction increased by 1 33 times from 80 to 160 m the maximum applied force to the shuttle tanker occurred at the distance of 160 m while the minimum force occurred at the distance of 400 m where the heave diffraction force was 0 62 times the maximum one 5 1 2 diffraction force in rotational motions fig 11 shows the diffraction forces on the shuttle tanker in the three rotational motions namely roll pitch and yaw at different vertical positions of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso according to fig 11a the maximum diffraction force applied to the tanker in the roll motion occurred at the distance of 220 m at which the diffraction force was 1 14 times the force at the initial position of the tanker there was also a downtrend in the range of 220 280 m for which the applied force reached its minimum value by 0 15 times reduction it can be seen in fig 11b that the maximum pitch diffraction force was applied at the distance of 220 m with an increase of 1 84 times compared to the force at the initial position at the distance of 80 m in addition the minimum force in the pitch motion occurred at the distance of 400 m where the force was 0 18 times the maximum one as can be observed in fig 11c the minimum diffraction force applied to the shuttle tanker in the yaw motion occurred at the initial distance of 80 m the maximum force occurred at the distance of 320 m and was 2 17 times the minimum yaw diffraction force the total diffraction forces obtained in six degrees of freedom are shown in the bar chart of fig 12 and it is clear that the minimum diffraction force occurred at the distance of 400 m with the next low values for the distances of 280 and 300 m respectively this was predictable due to the large share of heave diffraction force compared to the share of forces in the other degrees of freedom see figs 10 and 11 and considering that minimum heave diffraction force occurred at the distance of 400 m besides the maximum total force was applied to the tanker at the distance of 220 m and then at the distances of 160 and 140 m respectively the heave diffraction force at the distance of 160 m the maximum heave diffraction force and that at the distance of 400 m the minimum heave diffraction force are compared in fig 13 in the following the effects of different loading conditions of the vessels on the diffraction and froud krylov forces applied to the tanker are examined according to table 7 it is obvious that the highest hydrodynamic forces acting on the shuttle tanker occurred when both vessels were in the ballast load condition in cases where one of the vessels was in the ballast load condition and the other in full load condition the larger force was applied to the shuttle tanker when the fpso vessel was in the ballast load condition see table 7 type 2 and 4 the minimum hydrodynamic force was also applied to the shuttle tanker before the start of the offloading operation in which case the shuttle tanker was in the ballast load condition based on the results reported by lopez et al under various loading conditions variation in the rao of roll motion is more significant compared with those of other degrees of freedom and the roll motion is an important motion in the beam sea condition lopez et al 2017 thus for the conditions given in table 7 the rao of roll motion was evaluated in addition fig 14 shows the rao of roll motion for the shuttle tanker for all the conditions presented in table 7 it is seen in this figure that the maximum roll rao occurred for the 1st type and then in the 4th type for which the shuttle tanker was in the ballast load condition and the resonant frequencies of both types were also the same 0 6 rad s for the 2nd and 3rd types for which the shuttle tanker was fully loaded the minimum roll rao occurred when both vessels were in full load condition 3rd type at the frequency of 0 7 rad s due to the hydrodynamic interaction between the fpso and the shuttle tanker coupled resonance was observed in the rao 5 1 3 frequency domain analysis of heave diffraction force according to the information presented in the previous section the frequency domain analysis of diffraction and froud krylov forces in the heave dof acting on the shuttle tanker was conducted at the distances of 160 m maximum heave diffraction force in time domain analysis and 400 m selected distance fig 15 a and c illustrate three dimensional diagrams of diffraction forces and fig 15b and d shows three dimensional diagrams of froud krylov forces both acting on the shuttle tanker at the distances of 160 and 400 m respectively according to fig 15a the maximum diffraction force at the distance of 160 m occurred at the frequency of 0 54 rad s and the heading angle of 100 from the positive direction of the x axis at higher and lower frequencies than the above frequency the force value decreased significantly it is also obvious in fig 15b that the maximum froud krylov force happened at the frequency of 0 1 rad s and the heading angle of 100 while at lower periods the froud krylov force decreased as can be observed in fig 15c the maximum diffraction force acting on the shuttle tanker at the distance of 400 m occurred at the same frequency of 0 54 rad s as that for the distance of 160 m but at a different heading angle of 100 it is also obvious from fig 15d that the maximum froud krylov force occurred at the same frequency of 0 1 rad s as that for the distance of 160 m but at a different heading angle of 100 similar to the case with the time domain analysis the heave diffraction force acting on the shuttle tanker at the distance of 160 m was greater 1 07 times than that at the distance of 400 m in the frequency domain analysis as can be seen from the above results there are no significant changes in the froud krylov forces in frequency domain analysis with increasing distance between vessels from 160 to 400 m and similar to the case with the time domain analysis the assessment of froud krylov forces with increasing distance can be neglected fig 16 shows the diffracted wave patterns corresponding to the maximum and minimum diffraction forces at the distance of 400 m see fig 15c for incident waves with a wave amplitude of 4 m the distribution of diffracted waves at the frequency of 0 54 rad s and the heading angle of 100 is shown in fig 16a it is clear that the diffracted wave elevations between vessels are great the distribution of the diffracted waves at the frequency of 1 21 rad s and the heading angle of 20 is shown in fig 16b in which it is evident that the diffracted wave elevation is larger in the gap between the bows 5 2 comparison of dynamic responses for multi body and single body cases in this section the dynamic assessment of fpso and shuttle tanker oscillations is conducted in two cases i only one vessel is exposed to sea waves single body fig 17 and ii the two vessels interact with each other and with waves multi body including the coupling effects between the two vessels the time series analyses of the vessels were conducted considering the jonswap spectrum of irregular waves and api wind spectrum based on the environmental conditions of the caspian sea for a 100 year return period as can be seen in table 8 by analyzing the static tensions in the mooring lines line 7 was found to have the largest tension therefore only line 7 was assessed to examine the effects of tension fig 17 indicates the arrangement and number of mooring lines due to the interaction effects on the mooring system tensions the study was carried out only on the mooring line and the riser assessment was neglected due to its high weight per unit length and the expected smaller responses relative to interactions the global coordinate system o xyz fixed with the earth was used to describe the motions of the two vessels with the x y plane corresponding to the surface of the still water line zhao et al 2013 see fig 17 through comparing fig 18 a and b it is seen that in the multi body situation the peak amplitude of the surge motion for the fpso increases while that of the tanker decreases this occurs partly due to the presence of the tanker behind the fpso leading to the direct exposure of a side of the fpso to environmental forces in the beam sea direction fig 18c and d indicate that there is no significant distinction between the heave motion responses of the two vessels in single and multi body conditions this can be explained by the fact that the vertical motion of the vessels is mainly influenced by the hydro stiffness induced by the incident waves zhao et al 2013 by comparing fig 18e and f the pitch motion oscillations of the shuttle tanker are greater than those of the fpso due to the proximity of the vessels to each other the pitch motion response of the fpso increases while that of the shuttle tanker declines this occurs due to large oscillations in the fpso s weather side and small oscillations in the shuttle tanker s lee side owing to the negligible heave motion oscillations of the fpso in both single body and multi body cases mooring lines do not experience large oscillations as can be seen in fig 18 g also the loads on the mooring lines are mostly in the form of low frequency loads that involve a certain level of wave frequency characteristics which seem to be formed by wave dynamics zhao et al 2013 in the following as seen in fig 19 the dynamic responses of the shuttle tanker are analyzed in the most critical motions in the beam sea condition including sway roll and yaw by comparing fig 19a and b it can be seen that for the single body case the peak of sway motion response is 1 21 times greater than the case in which the tanker is behind the fpso and interacts with it in the single body case the peak of roll motion is 1 59 times than that in the case in which the vessels are interacting with each other however the peak of yaw motion increases by 1 20 times due to hydrodynamic interactions the results show a negative correlation between the sway and yaw motions of the shuttle tanker the negative correlation can be explained by the fact that the sway motion does not mutually change with variations in yaw motion and vice versa this negative correlation decreases the sideway motions and controls the vessel s head zhao et al 2013 the negative mean oscillations of the interacting tanker as seen in fig 19 suggest that the vessel tend to have reverse oscillations in the present flow field induced by waves and multi body motions 5 3 angular positions of the shuttle tanker within a 400 m radius the dynamic responses of the two vessels for the angular positions of the shuttle tanker within the selected radius of 400 m around the fpso in both the time and frequency domains are explored in this section for this purpose calculations were carried out at four angles of 30 60 120 and 150 from the positive direction of the x axis as seen in fig 20 5 3 1 the shuttle tanker motion response spectra in beam sea condition the time domain responses are converted by the fourier transform to examine the motion responses in terms of a spectrum ji et al 2011 the motion response spectra are determined for sway roll and yaw degrees of freedom according to the beam sea condition of the caspian sea the shuttle tanker s motion response spectra are illustrated in fig 21 as can be seen in fig 21a the peak amplitude of the sway motion spectrum decreases with increasing the positioning angle of the tanker from the positive x axis with these changes being significant only in the low frequency range according to fig 21b the second peak of the roll motion spectrum has a downward trend from type 1 to 4 in the wave frequency range the peak energy amplitude occurs at a relatively constant frequency 0 33 rad s for types 1 to 3 while for type 4 it occurs at a smaller amplitude and resonance frequency than those of the other three types the highest peak roll motion response in the low frequency range occurs for the first type and then the fourth type while the lowest peak energy amplitude of roll motion occurred in the low frequency range for the second type it should also be considered that the level of roll energy in the low frequency range can be ignored against the wave frequency energy it is also obvious from fig 21c that the second peak of the yaw response occurs in the low frequency range for all types the highest yaw energy level belongs to the second type and the lowest yaw energy level which is almost zero occurs in the 4th type it can be seen from fig 21 that roll motions transfer less energy than surge and yaw motions and thus produce smaller waves chen and fang 2001 fig 21 indicates that the transferred energy level is higher in the sway motion for the first type 30 thus it is assessed and compared under three conditions head sea beam sea and quartering sea as seen in fig 22 the direction of the incident wave is of considerable significance in the amount of transferred energy such that in the case with the heading angle of 180 the amount of transferred energy in the analysis of sway motion is nearly zero in addition the maximum amount of transferred energy occurs in quartering waves 5 3 2 evaluation of diffraction forces hydrodynamic interactions are strongly dependent upon the positions of the vessels and the frequency and heading angle of the waves chen and fang 2001 in fig 23 the dynamic responses of the diffraction force are investigated for different tanker positions under the beam sea head sea and quartering sea conditions in the second order stokes waves as shown in fig 23a b and c respectively the bar chart of the peak diffraction force responses is also displayed in fig 24 as mentioned above the maximum force occurred in the heave direction therefore the hydrodynamic forces were evaluated in the heave direction throughout this research unless otherwise stated according to fig 23a and the bar chart in fig 24 the maximum diffraction force occurs in the beam sea condition at the angle of 60 and then at the angle of 120 while the minimum force occurs at the angle of 30 and then at the angle of 150 from figs 23b and 24 it can be observed that the maximum diffraction forces occur in head sea condition at the angles of 150 and 60 and the minimum forces occur at the angles of 30 and 120 respectively in quartering sea condition the maximum diffraction forces occur at the angles of 60 and 120 while the minimum diffraction forces occur at the angles of 150 and 30 respectively this is shown in figs 23c and 24 moreover according to fig 24 the largest diffraction force is applied to the shuttle tanker in beam sea condition therefore in the following the effects of the froude krylov force are investigated in beam sea condition as shown in fig 25 the maximum froude krylov forces acting on the tanker occur at the angles of 60 and 120 while the minimum froude krylov forces acting on the tanker occur at the angles of 150 and 30 moreover the peak froude krylov force is 1 56 times the peak diffraction force at the angle of 60 generally it can be concluded that the 60 degree angular position of the shuttle tanker at the distance of 400 m from the fpso is a critical position in all three conditions 5 4 study of hydrodynamic interactions between shuttle tanker and fpso perpendicular to each other the hydrodynamic forces applied to vessels are directly influenced by the position of adjacent vessels therefore numerical calculations were carried out to assess the effect of the shuttle tanker position on the hydrodynamic forces within the 400 m radius of the fpso the same radius considered in previous calculations the evaluations were conducted for the case where the shuttle tanker was located at the angle of 90 relative to the fpso with its forward in the y direction fig 26 shows how the two vessels are positioned relative to each other 5 4 1 evaluation of the froude krylov and diffraction forces in three sea conditions the froude krylov and diffraction forces were evaluated for both the vessels in three beam head and quartering sea conditions fig 27 shows the froude krylov and diffraction forces acting on the fpso right side and the tanker left side as shown in fig 27a the maximum diffraction force acting on the fpso occurs in the beam sea condition for which the peak value is 4 12 times the minimum peak of the diffraction force in the head sea condition moreover the diffraction force peaks are close to each other in both the head sea and quartering conditions and the diffraction force peak in the quartering condition is 1 37 times the minimum diffraction force peak in the head sea condition as shown in fig 27b the greatest diffraction force acting on the tanker occurs in the head sea condition for which the peak value is 4 80 times the minimum peak of diffraction force in the beam sea condition additionally similar to the case for the fpso the peak values of diffraction forces are close to each other in the head sea and quartering sea conditions however here the peak diffraction force in the head sea condition is 1 048 times the peak diffraction force in the quartering sea condition fig 27c shows that the maximum froude krylov force occurs in the beam sea condition similar to the case with the diffraction force while the minimum froude krylov force occurs in the quartering sea condition as can be observed the froude krylov force is approximately zero in the initial seconds and then becomes ascending the peak froude krylov force in the head sea condition is 1 002 times the peak force in the quartering sea condition i e the peak froude krylov forces can be assumed to be the same for the two cases mentioned above fig 27d also shows that similar to the diffraction force the maximum froude krylov force acting on the tanker occurs in the head sea condition for which the peak is 4 06 times the peak minimum force in the beam sea condition similar to the froude krylov force for the fpso in the quartering sea condition this force also increases for the tanker with time and its peak in these conditions is 0 94 times its value in the head sea condition generally it can be concluded that when the environmental forces are applied on the vessel side the response of the diffraction and froude krylov forces for that vessel can be large therefore the maximum diffraction and froude krylov forces for the fpso and the shuttle tanker are observed in the beam sea and head sea conditions respectively 5 4 2 applying different wavelengths in critical sea conditions as the weather conditions in the sea change in different seasons the vessel response was assessed for various wavelengths in critical sea conditions ghafari et al 2019 in the following different wavelengths of the second order stokes waves are applied and the dynamic responses of the vessels for critical sea conditions obtained in the previous section are assessed for this purpose four wavelengths of 70 90 110 and 130 m are investigated as can be observed in fig 28 a and c by increasing the wavelength the diffraction force and froude krylov force show a rising trend and the maximum peak diffraction force at the wavelength of 130 m is 0 66 times the maximum peak froude krylov force at the same wavelength according to fig 28b it is obvious that by increasing the wavelength in the head sea condition the interactions between the two vessels slowly reduces the diffraction force acting on the shuttle tanker such that the maximum peak diffraction force at the wavelength of 70 m is 1 15 times the minimum peak diffraction force at the wavelength of 130 m from fig 28d it can be observed that similar to the case with fpso by increasing the wavelength the froude krylov force of the shuttle tanker increases with the force peak at the wavelength of 130 m being 1 44 times the force peak at the wavelength of 70 m according to fig 28b in the heave dof the diffraction force acting on the shuttle tanker shows a downward trend as the wavelength increases thus considering that this case was investigated in the head sea condition and that the surge heave and pitch dofs are of significant importance in this condition the diffraction force is therefore investigated in the surge and pitch dofs for the shuttle tanker in the head sea condition to assess the variation of the diffraction force in other degrees of freedom as shown in fig 29 a and b by increasing the wavelength the surge and pitch diffraction forces increase the bar chart in fig 30 compares the peak diffraction forces in the three degrees of freedom mentioned above as can be observed the diffraction force in the heave degree of freedom has a much larger share in comparison to those in other degrees of freedom in the following the dynamic responses of the shuttle tanker in the head sea condition are assessed at different wavelengths in the surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom fig 31 shows the dynamic responses of the shuttle tanker in the surge heave and pitch dofs additionally fig 32 shows the peak oscillations of the tanker in the time domain at various wavelengths figs 31a and 32 show that the peak dynamic response of the tanker in the surge dof increases by 1 4 times as the wavelength increases from 70 to 130 figs 31b and 32 indicate an increase in the vertical oscillations of the vessel with increasing the wavelength such that the peak heave motions response increases from 3 23 m to 3 68 m when the wavelength increased from 70 to 130 m moreover figs 31c and 32 show that the pitch motion response increases by 1 58 times as the wavelength increases from 70 to 130 m 6 conclusion the hydrodynamic performance of two vessels multi body case a floating production storage and offloading fpso and a shuttle tanker was investigated under the environmental conditions of the caspian sea using the numerical boundary element method bem in different positions of shuttle tanker relative to the fpso the most important results obtained in this study are as follows among different vertical center to center distances of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso from 80 m to 440 m and considering the analysis of the forces in six degrees of freedom the maximum and minimum total diffraction forces occurred at the distances of 220 and 400 m between the centers of the two vessels respectively changing the vertical distance between the centers of the two vessels has no effect on the calculated froude krylov force in this regard by increasing the vertical distance the calculated froude krylov forces in both time and frequency domains do not change when the shuttle tanker is located at the vertical distance of 400 m relative to the fpso the responses of the two vessels for the multi body case and in irregular wave conditions indicate an increase in the surge and pitch responses for the fpso and a decrease in these responses for the shuttle tanker in addition by examining the variation of the mooring line tension and the heave dof it is found that the results obtained for the multi body case are not significantly different from those obtained for the single body case in the multi body case the sway and roll oscillations of the shuttle tanker decrease and its yaw oscillations increase in comparison to those in the single body case when the centers of the two vessels are 400 m apart the position of the tanker at a 60 degree angle relative to the positive direction of the x axis creates a critical situation in the three conditions of the head sea beam sea and quartering sea in the 90 degree position of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso within the horizontal radius of 400 m the shuttle tanker s stern is exposed to the incident waves the diffraction and froude krylov forces are large for that vessel when the environmental forces are applied to side of the vessel therefore the highest diffraction and froude krylov forces are observed in the head sea condition for the shuttle tanker and in the beam sea condition for the fpso in the head sea condition for the 90 degree position of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso within the radius of 400 m the dynamic responses of the vessel in the surge heave and pitch dofs increase by increasing the wavelength moreover the surge and pitch diffraction forces increase and the heave diffraction force decreases credit authorship contribution statement shima tafazzoli conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data curation writing original

20712,floating production storage and offloading fpso platforms are among the most important platforms in the offshore oil and gas industry these platforms are generally anchored to the seabed through mooring lines usually the fpso and the oil tanker are nearby before starting the offloading operation in this research the hydrodynamic interactions between a turret moored fpso and shuttle tanker were examined using the boundary element method for coupled time domain dynamic analyses to apply the sea conditions the environmental conditions of the caspian sea were considered in this regard considering the values of hydrodynamic forces on the shuttle tanker the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the most appropriate vertical position of the shuttle tanker in the vicinity of fpso therefore 19 vertical center to center distances with steps of 20 m from 80 m to 440 m were considered between the two vessels a comprehensive assessment of the dynamic responses of the two floating vessels was then conducted at different angular positions of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso the numerical results indicated that the minimum hydrodynamic force was applied to the shuttle tanker for the distance of 400 m between the centers of the vessels also the 60 degree position of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso within a 400 m radius was the most critical position in terms

natural gas lng as the most important sources of energy for humans stranded oil and gas fields in the seas and oceans have received more attention typically these fields are situated in deep waters and isolated from onshore infrastructure or other offshore pipelines this makes their exploitation challenging thus the floating production storage and offloading fpso system is the right choice due to the lack of need for piping zhao et al 2013 iran is ranked second in the world with about 34 trillion cubic meters of natural gas reserves iran is also ranked among the top five countries in the world in terms of oil reserves it is worth noting that most of these resources are located in the seas of this country therefore extracting these precious reserves is critical for the development and prosperity of the country in this regard it is worth mentioning that the northern iran s caspian sea has significant non extracted oil and gas reserves the caspian sea as the world s largest lake is 220 550 km wide and 1200 km long with an area of 436 000 km2 and the volume of more than 77 000 km3 alamian et al 2017a 2017b the water depth in various parts of the caspian sea is as follows 10 12 m in the northern part 770 m in the middle part and 1000 m in the deepest point of the southern part zeraatgar and hajiarab 2003 fig 1 shows the characteristic wave height with a 100 year return period for the northern and southern parts of the caspian sea region there are many offshore applications today where two or more floating bodies in close proximity of each other encounter substantial interactions hence it is necessary to investigate the hydrodynamic interactions of several bodies so that the effect of the flow field from one structure on another can be investigated the magnitude of hydrodynamic effects between several floating bodies in given sea conditions depends on the relative dimensions of the floating bodies and their separation distances ghafari et al 2019 chen and fang utilized three dimensional potential flow theory based on the source distribution method to analyze the hydrodynamic issues of two moving ships in waves the results revealed that the coupled resonance peaks appeared smaller this means that the standing wave generated between the two ships is not completely trapped they also showed that the roll motion in the waves decreased significantly with speed heave and pitch motions also decreased as the speed in the quartering waves increased while the sway motion increased chen and fang 2001 kim et al used a linearized three dimensional potential theory to perform numerical calculations for twelve coupled linear motion responses and relative motions between lng carrier fpso as well as various side by side positions of lng carrier at different angles of wave collision the results showed that resonance behavior and sheltering influence on the coupled motion responses as well as relative motions would result in a dangerous situation during the offloading operation kim et al 2003 zhao et al examined the hydrodynamic interactions between the flng vessel and lng carrier in the side by side arrangement using the simo code to explain and compare the hydrodynamic influences of the two vessels numerical simulations were conducted under similar environmental conditions without considering the hydrodynamic interactions the results showed that hydrodynamic interactions played a substantial role in the low frequency motion responses as well as the loads in the connecting systems zhao et al 2012 zhao et al examined the lng offloading operation between the flng vessel and the lng carrier attached to the flng s stern with tandem configuration analysis of the time domain was carried out to examine the hydrodynamic effects for two mooring types of the single mooring hawser and double mooring hawser links the results indicated that the double hawser link provided a more stable behavior for vessels than the single hawser link in the tandem offloading operation due to its higher lateral stiffness zhao et al 2013 yuan et al used a 3d rankine source code to analyze the effects of hydrodynamic interactions between two ships with the side by side configuration in shallow water their results indicated that hydrodynamic interactions in the beam sea condition were very significant besides by altering the distance between the two vessels the resonant frequency was significantly affected yuan et al 2014 yuan et al used the mhydro program based on the 3d rankin source method to study multi body hydrodynamic interactions during shallow water overtaking operation assessment of the obtained results against experimental data as well as computational fluid dynamics cfd data revealed that the developed model was suitable for predicting hydrodynamic interactions between two ships traveling with different speeds in confined waters yuan et al 2015 yuan et al studied the hydrodynamic interactions of two ships traveling in waves theoretically based on the far field wave patterns and numerically based on the three dimensional panel method using rankine green function the results showed that there was an enormous difference between theoretical and numerical calculations particularly in the low frequency range yuan et al 2016 abyn et al investigated the hydrodynamic interactions of the semi submersible platform and the tension leg platform tlp for obtaining relative surge heave and pitch motions in regular waves it was shown that the waves nonlinearity increased the amplitude of the oscillations of the semi submersible platform within the natural frequency range abyn et al 2016 wnęk et al used a cfd code to evaluate hydrodynamic interactions between two vessels a tanker and a tug configured parallel to each other at different lateral distances and two water depths for four separate flow models their results indicated that the viscosity effect on the computations was relatively small whereas the wave making effects could be substantial wnęk et al 2018 jin et al used the viscous unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes approach to analyze ship to ship interactions in regular waves the results indicated that as the frequency of the incident wave approached the natural frequency of motion for both lng carrier and flng vessel the gap wave resonance induced a pronounced change in wave forces on vessels at varying degrees of freedom dofs jin et al 2018 ghafari et al analyzed the influences of various distances on diffraction and froude krylov forces between the centers of amirkabir semi submersible and the mono column fpso platforms the results showed when the center to center distance of the structures increased no significant effect on the froude krylov force was observed while the maximum peak of diffraction force increased ghafari et al 2019 xu et al examined the interactions between the fpso and shuttle tanker during side by side offloading considering that the drafts of the two vessels change accordingly during the transfer operation the results showed that by reducing the draft the heave and roll added masses of the fpso increased thus the empty load condition has the highest roll and heave added masses xu et al 2019 tang et al simulated the coupled motions and hydrodynamic interactions between the wigley hull ship and the rectangular barge with the side by side configuration in beam sea waves using the 3d green function method in addition the parallel coupled motions of two other ships a supply ship and a frigate in a side by side configuration and with the same forward speed were also estimated a comparison of experimental and numerical results showed that the time domain hybrid green function method was effective for the coupled motions of the two adjacent ships in waves tang et al 2020 the second order hydrodynamic force on fixed and floating cylinders with a tandem arrangement was determined by motallebi et al the findings demonstrated that the existence of a fixed cylinder had a clear increasing effect on the second order forces in that the force in the heave direction increased by up to 1 55 times for a significant parameter of the floating cylinder motallebi et al 2020 coupled dynamic analysis was conducted in this paper to evaluate the responses of a fully loaded turret moored fpso and ballast loaded shuttle tanker the hydrodynamic performance of the vessels was studied in a deepwater location under the caspian sea environmental conditions through numerical simulations using the boundary element method bem although first order forces account for a large share of wave forces in some cases the nonlinear effects of waves and second order wave forces cannot be ignored ghafari et al 2019 in this paper using first and second order wave forces hydrodynamic interactions between two floating vessels were calculated using three dimensional theories of radiation diffraction the primary aim of this research is to examine different distances between the centers of the turret moored fpso and shuttle tanker to obtain the optimum distance before starting the offloading operation and then examining different angular positions of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso and different wavelengths in second order stokes waves at the optimum distance the effects of hydrodynamic interactions on the vessels multi body analysis mooring lines tensions and their dynamic coupling effects were also thoroughly considered 2 features of vessels in this paper a numerical simulation of hydrodynamic interactions between the fpso and shuttle tanker was carried out at various shuttle tanker positions relative to fpso under the environmental conditions of the caspian sea to conduct hydrodynamic analysis a significant wave height of 8 m and a wave period of 9 4 s were considered see fig 1 ghafari et al 2019 the analysis was carried in a water depth of 1000 m 2 1 fpso vessel the fpso considered in this paper has a simple rectangular body with a box shaped middle cross section the fpso has a bilge keel with a width of 1 m and length of 120 m fpso was first proposed as part of the planned development in the gulf of mexico in water depths of 1000 2000 m lopez et al 2017 the geometrical specifications of the fpso are shown in table 1 2 1 1 turret mooring system the fpso has an inner turret mooring system with a prototype diameter of 12 m consisting of nine mooring lines and six risers the vertical position of the turret center is 30 m behind the forward perpendicular lopez et al 2017 the role of the turret is to create the tie in mechanism for the fpso and it enables the body to yaw relative to the mooring lines and risers lopez et al 2017 the mooring line system has nine lines in three groups each with three lines in a symmetrical layout separated from each other with 120 the individual lines are similar and each consists of three chain cable chain segments each line in a group is separated from the adjacent line by five degrees six steel catenary risers scrs were designed in a simple symmetrical layout the risers were organized into three groups separated from each other with 120 lopez et al 2017 the turret is designed in such a way that in severe weather conditions it disconnects itself from the floater and reconnects with the floater afterwards therefore it is suitable for the caspian sea environmental conditions the details of fpso mooring lines and risers are also presented in tables 2 and 3 2 2 shuttle tanker in this paper a ballast load condition with a displacement of 31 143 tonnes and a draft of 8 5 m from the keel was considered for the shuttle tanker xu et al 2019 the geometrical specifications of the shuttle tanker are given in table 4 fig 2 also shows a view of the vessels in the software 3 governing equations 3 1 theory of three dimensional diffraction analysis of boundary element the wave force in the wave diffraction theory is calculated as the pressure integral on the wetted body surface such a method can be utilized in cases where the object dimensions are large in comparison with the wave motion amplitude and the forces caused by the fluid s viscosity can be ignored also where the dimensions of the object are sufficiently big compared to the sea wavelength such that they influence the surrounding wave field related to the waves diffraction radiation bae et al 2017 the linear superposition theorem can be utilized for formulating the velocity potential in the fluid domain because the first order potential theory of diffraction and radiation waves is utilized here for the analysis of diffraction radiation the fluid flow field encircling a floating body can be expressed as follows using the velocity potential barltrop 1998 1 φ x t a w φ x e i w t in which a w represents the amplitude of the incident wave and ω gives the frequency of the wave in eq 1 the time independent term ϕ x can be divided into three portions including the potential of radiation wave ϕ r the potential of diffracted wave ϕ d and the potential of incident wave ϕ i although the potential functions are complex the resulting physical quantities including body motions in the analysis of time domain and fluid pressure are calculated via taking only the real part into account the velocity potential in terms of the contributions of the radiation diffraction and incident waves can be expressed as 2 φ x e i ω t φ i φ d 6 j 1 φ r j x j e i ω t in which ϕ r j is the potential of radiation wave related to j th motion the fluid flow in the diffraction theory is represented by the potential flow function and thus this function should be used in the laplace equation besides boundary conditions should also be met with these portions the body surface boundary condition the free water surface and seabed boundary conditions and the infinite boundary condition tafazzoli et al 2021 by employing the linear hydrodynamic

respect to the reactive and active components fluid forces can be further defined the reactive force is defined as the radiation force caused by radiation waves resulting from body motions the active

fixed or floating structures surrounded by a fluid that is incompressible inviscid homogeneous and irrotational the second order wave exciting forces are defined also the amplitude of the wave and the amplitude of the related structural motion responses are small in this concept pinkster 1980 it should be noted that the above assumption allows for the representation of the surrounding fluid by the velocity potential function the perturbation method is used for expressing the potential of fluid the elevation of the wave and the location of a point on the body 24 φ ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 o ε 3 ζ ζ 0 ε ζ 1

moment 3 4 equations of an individual mooring line the evaluation of hydrodynamic forces and tensions on mooring lines has always been of particular interest to design effective mooring systems for floating structures by applying restoring forces to the horizontal plane the mooring system controls motions in the surge sway and yaw dofs tafazzoli et al 2021 fig 3 gives a view of an individual mooring line which is modeled as a chain subjected to the external forces using the morison element fig 4 presents an element of a circular cable on which some structural inertia forces and external hydrodynamic forces act there is no torsional deformation in the dynamic analysis of cable using the program ansys aqwa 2016 the equations of motion for the cable element are as follows 31 t s e v s e w f h m 2 r t 2 m s e r s e v q where t is used for expressing the tension vector in the first node of cable element de δ s e and w indicate the diameter length and weight of the element respectively f h represents the vectors of external hydrodynamic loads for unit length m shows the body mass for unit length r m and v represent the position vector bending moment vector and shear force vector in the first node of cable element respectively q indicates the moment loading for unit length ghafari et al 2019 the following equations determine the bending tension and moment in terms of the axial stiffness and bending stiffness ea and ei respectively of the cable material 32 m e i r s e 2 r s e 2 t e a ε where ԑ indicates the axial strain in the element for obtaining a unique solution for eq

hydrodynamic force f h affecting the element involves the buoyant force and drag force as well as the radiation force associated with the added mass ansys aqwa 2016 34 f h f b f d m a a j a j 1 t where m a specifies the added mass matrix for the element and a j indicates the acceleration of the cable at the j th node 4 numerical solution according to the governing equations and the introduced conditions the boundary element method has been used for numerical simulation in the boundary element method by considering the boundary conditions and developing the laplace equation the potential function is obtained in the software the model of diffraction panels is used for large cross section parts of the vessel and the morison element for small cross section components each individual mooring line is also modeled as a set of morison elements considering the conditions for applying the morison equation the effects of viscosity are significant however in the theory of diffraction fluid is considered non viscous at low wave frequencies viscous forces create drift forces in addition to damping in which case the viscous damping term is taken into account tafazzoli et al 2021 4 1 mesh generation in the boundary element software according to the desired accuracy it is only necessary to enter the size of the elements for mesh generation of course at this stage it should be noted that the maximum mesh frequency does not exceed the maximum wave frequency since this will lead to wrong answers tafazzoli and shafaghat 2019 also a finer mesh size increases both accuracy and computation time 4 1 1 mesh independence study fig 5 provides a view of the meshed vessels in the software moreover tables 5 and 6 display the size and number of mesh elements for the shuttle tanker and fpso respectively for the independence of the numerical solution from the mesh size the sway response amplitude operators raos of the shuttle tanker and fpso for different mesh sizes are shown in fig 6 a and b as can be seen in table 5 and fig 6a the shuttle tanker s sway response amplitude operator does not change from the 4th mesh size onwards therefore the mesh size is considered as 1 8 m for the shuttle tanker it can also be seen from table 6 and fig 6b that the fpso s sway response amplitude operators are the same for types 4 and 5 namely mesh sizes of 2 m and 1 8 m therefore the mesh of 1 8 m is chosen for both vessels taking into account the above discussion 4 2 validation in order to validate the numerical results of the fpso the results of an experimental study performed on a 1 64 scale fpso model in the wave tank of shanghai jiao tong university china were used fig 7 a lopez et al 2017 also the results of an experimental study on a 1 80 scale shuttle tanker model in the wave tank of jiangsu university china were used to validate the numerical results of the shuttle tanker fig 7b xu et al 2019 in this regard to confirm the results of this analysis three response amplitude operators were compared with the previous experimental results it should be noted that validation was carried out for the fully loaded fpso and the half loaded shuttle tanker under the imposed head sea conditions the vessels specifications are shown in tables 1 and 4 fig 8 a and b shows a comparison between the experimental and numerical performances of the fpso and shuttle tanker respectively as can be seen in fig 8 the experimental and numerical results agree well 5 results and discussion 5 1 the most suitable relative distance of vessels to select the best center to center distance between the vessels in the direction of beam sea waves the diffraction forces applied to the shuttle tanker in six dofs were examined at 19 distances with 20 m steps from 80 to 440 m see fig 9 finally the distance with the minimum diffraction force on the shuttle tanker was chosen in this research the forward speed of the shuttle tanker was zero it should be mentioned that increasing the distance between the centers of the two vessels does not have a significant effect on the froud krylov forces ghafari et al 2019 and thus these forces were not evaluated in this section 5 1 1 diffraction forces in linear motions as previously described the fpso s body alters the surrounding flow field therefore diffraction forces applied to the shuttle tanker were determined fig 10 illustrates the maximum hydrodynamic forces on the tanker in three linear dofs of surge sway and heave motions according to fig 10a the maximum diffraction force occurred in the surge direction at the distance of 200 m with an increase of 1 11 times relative to the force at the initial position of the tanker the distance of 80 m the minimum diffraction force applied to the tanker in the surge direction occurred when the center to center distance between the two vessels was about 300 m showing a 0 38 times decrease compared to the maximum applied force in the sway dof fig 10b the minimum diffraction force occurred at the distance of 280 m which was 0 61 times that at the initial position when the distance between the two vessels was raised to 320 m the force reached its maximum value which was twice the minimum value as can be seen in fig 10c the diffraction force in heave direction increased by 1 33 times from 80 to 160 m the maximum applied force to the shuttle tanker occurred at the distance of 160 m while the minimum force occurred at the distance of 400 m where the heave diffraction force was 0 62 times the maximum one 5 1 2 diffraction force in rotational motions fig 11 shows the diffraction forces on the shuttle tanker in the three rotational motions namely roll pitch and yaw at different vertical positions of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso according to fig 11a the maximum diffraction force applied to the tanker in the roll motion occurred at the distance of 220 m at which the diffraction force was 1 14 times the force at the initial position of the tanker there was also a downtrend in the range of 220 280 m for which the applied force reached its minimum value by 0 15 times reduction it can be seen in fig 11b that the maximum pitch diffraction force was applied at the distance of 220 m with an increase of 1 84 times compared to the force at the initial position at the distance of 80 m in addition the minimum force in the pitch motion occurred at the distance of 400 m where the force was 0 18 times the maximum one as can be observed in fig 11c the minimum diffraction force applied to the shuttle tanker in the yaw motion occurred at the initial distance of 80 m the maximum force occurred at the distance of 320 m and was 2 17 times the minimum yaw diffraction force the total diffraction forces obtained in six degrees of freedom are shown in the bar chart of fig 12 and it is clear that the minimum diffraction force occurred at the distance of 400 m with the next low values for the distances of 280 and 300 m respectively this was predictable due to the large share of heave diffraction force compared to the share of forces in the other degrees of freedom see figs 10 and 11 and considering that minimum heave diffraction force occurred at the distance of 400 m besides the maximum total force was applied to the tanker at the distance of 220 m and then at the distances of 160 and 140 m respectively the heave diffraction force at the distance of 160 m the maximum heave diffraction force and that at the distance of 400 m the minimum heave diffraction force are compared in fig 13 in the following the effects of different loading conditions of the vessels on the diffraction and froud krylov forces applied to the tanker are examined according to table 7 it is obvious that the highest hydrodynamic forces acting on the shuttle tanker occurred when both vessels were in the ballast load condition in cases where one of the vessels was in the ballast load condition and the other in full load condition the larger force was applied to the shuttle tanker when the fpso vessel was in the ballast load condition see table 7 type 2 and 4 the minimum hydrodynamic force was also applied to the shuttle tanker before the start of the offloading operation in which case the shuttle tanker was in the ballast load condition based on the results reported by lopez et al under various loading conditions variation in the rao of roll motion is more significant compared with those of other degrees of freedom and the roll motion is an important motion in the beam sea condition lopez et al 2017 thus for the conditions given in table 7 the rao of roll motion was evaluated in addition fig 14 shows the rao of roll motion for the shuttle tanker for all the conditions presented in table 7 it is seen in this figure that the maximum roll rao occurred for the 1st type and then in the 4th type for which the shuttle tanker was in the ballast load condition and the resonant frequencies of both types were also the same 0 6 rad s for the 2nd and 3rd types for which the shuttle tanker was fully loaded the minimum roll rao occurred when both vessels were in full load condition 3rd type at the frequency of 0 7 rad s due to the hydrodynamic interaction between the fpso and the shuttle tanker coupled resonance was observed in the rao 5 1 3 frequency domain analysis of heave diffraction force according to the information presented in the previous section the frequency domain analysis of diffraction and froud krylov forces in the heave dof acting on the shuttle tanker was conducted at the distances of 160 m maximum heave diffraction force in time domain analysis and 400 m selected distance fig 15 a and c illustrate three dimensional diagrams of diffraction forces and fig 15b and d shows three dimensional diagrams of froud krylov forces both acting on the shuttle tanker at the distances of 160 and 400 m respectively according to fig 15a the maximum diffraction force at the distance of 160 m occurred at the frequency of 0 54 rad s and the heading angle of 100 from the positive direction of the x axis at higher and lower frequencies than the above frequency the force value decreased significantly it is also obvious in fig 15b that the maximum froud krylov force happened at the frequency of 0 1 rad s and the heading angle of 100 while at lower periods the froud krylov force decreased as can be observed in fig 15c the maximum diffraction force acting on the shuttle tanker at the distance of 400 m occurred at the same frequency of 0 54 rad s as that for the distance of 160 m but at a different heading angle of 100 it is also obvious from fig 15d that the maximum froud krylov force occurred at the same frequency of 0 1 rad s as that for the distance of 160 m but at a different heading angle of 100 similar to the case with the time domain analysis the heave diffraction force acting on the shuttle tanker at the distance of 160 m was greater 1 07 times than that at the distance of 400 m in the frequency domain analysis as can be seen from the above results there are no significant changes in the froud krylov forces in frequency domain analysis with increasing distance between vessels from 160 to 400 m and similar to the case with the time domain analysis the assessment of froud krylov forces with increasing distance can be neglected fig 16 shows the diffracted wave patterns corresponding to the maximum and minimum diffraction forces at the distance of 400 m see fig 15c for incident waves with a wave amplitude of 4 m the distribution of diffracted waves at the frequency of 0 54 rad s and the heading angle of 100 is shown in fig 16a it is clear that the diffracted wave elevations between vessels are great the distribution of the diffracted waves at the frequency of 1 21 rad s and the heading angle of 20 is shown in fig 16b in which it is evident that the diffracted wave elevation is larger in the gap between the bows 5 2 comparison of dynamic responses for multi body and single body cases in this section the dynamic assessment of fpso and shuttle tanker oscillations is conducted in two cases i only one vessel is exposed to sea waves single body fig 17 and ii the two vessels interact with each other and with waves multi body including the coupling effects between the two vessels the time series analyses of the vessels were conducted considering the jonswap spectrum of irregular waves and api wind spectrum based on the environmental conditions of the caspian sea for a 100 year return period as can be seen in table 8 by analyzing the static tensions in the mooring lines line 7 was found to have the largest tension therefore only line 7 was assessed to examine the effects of tension fig 17 indicates the arrangement and number of mooring lines due to the interaction effects on the mooring system tensions the study was carried out only on the mooring line and the riser assessment was neglected due to its high weight per unit length and the expected smaller responses relative to interactions the global coordinate system o xyz fixed with the earth was used to describe the motions of the two vessels with the x y plane corresponding to the surface of the still water line zhao et al 2013 see fig 17 through comparing fig 18 a and b it is seen that in the multi body situation the peak amplitude of the surge motion for the fpso increases while that of the tanker decreases this occurs partly due to the presence of the tanker behind the fpso leading to the direct exposure of a side of the fpso to environmental forces in the beam sea direction fig 18c and d indicate that there is no significant distinction between the heave motion responses of the two vessels in single and multi body conditions this can be explained by the fact that the vertical motion of the vessels is mainly influenced by the hydro stiffness induced by the incident waves zhao et al 2013 by comparing fig 18e and f the pitch motion oscillations of the shuttle tanker are greater than those of the fpso due to the proximity of the vessels to each other the pitch motion response of the fpso increases while that of the shuttle tanker declines this occurs due to large oscillations in the fpso s weather side and small oscillations in the shuttle tanker s lee side owing to the negligible heave motion oscillations of the fpso in both single body and multi body cases mooring lines do not experience large oscillations as can be seen in fig 18 g also the loads on the mooring lines are mostly in the form of low frequency loads that involve a certain level of wave frequency characteristics which seem to be formed by wave dynamics zhao et al 2013 in the following as seen in fig 19 the dynamic responses of the shuttle tanker are analyzed in the most critical motions in the beam sea condition including sway roll and yaw by comparing fig 19a and b it can be seen that for the single body case the peak of sway motion response is 1 21 times greater than the case in which the tanker is behind the fpso and interacts with it in the single body case the peak of roll motion is 1 59 times than that in the case in which the vessels are interacting with each other however the peak of yaw motion increases by 1 20 times due to hydrodynamic interactions the results show a negative correlation between the sway and yaw motions of the shuttle tanker the negative correlation can be explained by the fact that the sway motion does not mutually change with variations in yaw motion and vice versa this negative correlation decreases the sideway motions and controls the vessel s head zhao et al 2013 the negative mean oscillations of the interacting tanker as seen in fig 19 suggest that the vessel tend to have reverse oscillations in the present flow field induced by waves and multi body motions 5 3 angular positions of the shuttle tanker within a 400 m radius the dynamic responses of the two vessels for the angular positions of the shuttle tanker within the selected radius of 400 m around the fpso in both the time and frequency domains are explored in this section for this purpose calculations were carried out at four angles of 30 60 120 and 150 from the positive direction of the x axis as seen in fig 20 5 3 1 the shuttle tanker motion response spectra in beam sea condition the time domain responses are converted by the fourier transform to examine the motion responses in terms of a spectrum ji et al 2011 the motion response spectra are determined for sway roll and yaw degrees of freedom according to the beam sea condition of the caspian sea the shuttle tanker s motion response spectra are illustrated in fig 21 as can be seen in fig 21a the peak amplitude of the sway motion spectrum decreases with increasing the positioning angle of the tanker from the positive x axis with these changes being significant only in the low frequency range according to fig 21b the second peak of the roll motion spectrum has a downward trend from type 1 to 4 in the wave frequency range the peak energy amplitude occurs at a relatively constant frequency 0 33 rad s for types 1 to 3 while for type 4 it occurs at a smaller amplitude and resonance frequency than those of the other three types the highest peak roll motion response in the low frequency range occurs for the first type and then the fourth type while the lowest peak energy amplitude of roll motion occurred in the low frequency range for the second type it should also be considered that the level of roll energy in the low frequency range can be ignored against the wave frequency energy it is also obvious from fig 21c that the second peak of the yaw response occurs in the low frequency range for all types the highest yaw energy level belongs to the second type and the lowest yaw energy level which is almost zero occurs in the 4th type it can be seen from fig 21 that roll motions transfer less energy than surge and yaw motions and thus produce smaller waves chen and fang 2001 fig 21 indicates that the transferred energy level is higher in the sway motion for the first type 30 thus it is assessed and compared under three conditions head sea beam sea and quartering sea as seen in fig 22 the direction of the incident wave is of considerable significance in the amount of transferred energy such that in the case with the heading angle of 180 the amount of transferred energy in the analysis of sway motion is nearly zero in addition the maximum amount of transferred energy occurs in quartering waves 5 3 2 evaluation of diffraction forces hydrodynamic interactions are strongly dependent upon the positions of the vessels and the frequency and heading angle of the waves chen and fang 2001 in fig 23 the dynamic responses of the diffraction force are investigated for different tanker positions under the beam sea head sea and quartering sea conditions in the second order stokes waves as shown in fig 23a b and c respectively the bar chart of the peak diffraction force responses is also displayed in fig 24 as mentioned above the maximum force occurred in the heave direction therefore the hydrodynamic forces were evaluated in the heave direction throughout this research unless otherwise stated according to fig 23a and the bar chart in fig 24 the maximum diffraction force occurs in the beam sea condition at the angle of 60 and then at the angle of 120 while the minimum force occurs at the angle of 30 and then at the angle of 150 from figs 23b and 24 it can be observed that the maximum diffraction forces occur in head sea condition at the angles of 150 and 60 and the minimum forces occur at the angles of 30 and 120 respectively in quartering sea condition the maximum diffraction forces occur at the angles of 60 and 120 while the minimum diffraction forces occur at the angles of 150 and 30 respectively this is shown in figs 23c and 24 moreover according to fig 24 the largest diffraction force is applied to the shuttle tanker in beam sea condition therefore in the following the effects of the froude krylov force are investigated in beam sea condition as shown in fig 25 the maximum froude krylov forces acting on the tanker occur at the angles of 60 and 120 while the minimum froude krylov forces acting on the tanker occur at the angles of 150 and 30 moreover the peak froude krylov force is 1 56 times the peak diffraction force at the angle of 60 generally it can be concluded that the 60 degree angular position of the shuttle tanker at the distance of 400 m from the fpso is a critical position in all three conditions 5 4 study of hydrodynamic interactions between shuttle tanker and fpso perpendicular to each other the hydrodynamic forces applied to vessels are directly influenced by the position of adjacent vessels therefore numerical calculations were carried out to assess the effect of the shuttle tanker position on the hydrodynamic forces within the 400 m radius of the fpso the same radius considered in previous calculations the evaluations were conducted for the case where the shuttle tanker was located at the angle of 90 relative to the fpso with its forward in the y direction fig 26 shows how the two vessels are positioned relative to each other 5 4 1 evaluation of the froude krylov and diffraction forces in three sea conditions the froude krylov and diffraction forces were evaluated for both the vessels in three beam head and quartering sea conditions fig 27 shows the froude krylov and diffraction forces acting on the fpso right side and the tanker left side as shown in fig 27a the maximum diffraction force acting on the fpso occurs in the beam sea condition for which the peak value is 4 12 times the minimum peak of the diffraction force in the head sea condition moreover the diffraction force peaks are close to each other in both the head sea and quartering conditions and the diffraction force peak in the quartering condition is 1 37 times the minimum diffraction force peak in the head sea condition as shown in fig 27b the greatest diffraction force acting on the tanker occurs in the head sea condition for which the peak value is 4 80 times the minimum peak of diffraction force in the beam sea condition additionally similar to the case for the fpso the peak values of diffraction forces are close to each other in the head sea and quartering sea conditions however here the peak diffraction force in the head sea condition is 1 048 times the peak diffraction force in the quartering sea condition fig 27c shows that the maximum froude krylov force occurs in the beam sea condition similar to the case with the diffraction force while the minimum froude krylov force occurs in the quartering sea condition as can be observed the froude krylov force is approximately zero in the initial seconds and then becomes ascending the peak froude krylov force in the head sea condition is 1 002 times the peak force in the quartering sea condition i e the peak froude krylov forces can be assumed to be the same for the two cases mentioned above fig 27d also shows that similar to the diffraction force the maximum froude krylov force acting on the tanker occurs in the head sea condition for which the peak is 4 06 times the peak minimum force in the beam sea condition similar to the froude krylov force for the fpso in the quartering sea condition this force also increases for the tanker with time and its peak in these conditions is 0 94 times its value in the head sea condition generally it can be concluded that when the environmental forces are applied on the vessel side the response of the diffraction and froude krylov forces for that vessel can be large therefore the maximum diffraction and froude krylov forces for the fpso and the shuttle tanker are observed in the beam sea and head sea conditions respectively 5 4 2 applying different wavelengths in critical sea conditions as the weather conditions in the sea change in different seasons the vessel response was assessed for various wavelengths in critical sea conditions ghafari et al 2019 in the following different wavelengths of the second order stokes waves are applied and the dynamic responses of the vessels for critical sea conditions obtained in the previous section are assessed for this purpose four wavelengths of 70 90 110 and 130 m are investigated as can be observed in fig 28 a and c by increasing the wavelength the diffraction force and froude krylov force show a rising trend and the maximum peak diffraction force at the wavelength of 130 m is 0 66 times the maximum peak froude krylov force at the same wavelength according to fig 28b it is obvious that by increasing the wavelength in the head sea condition the interactions between the two vessels slowly reduces the diffraction force acting on the shuttle tanker such that the maximum peak diffraction force at the wavelength of 70 m is 1 15 times the minimum peak diffraction force at the wavelength of 130 m from fig 28d it can be observed that similar to the case with fpso by increasing the wavelength the froude krylov force of the shuttle tanker increases with the force peak at the wavelength of 130 m being 1 44 times the force peak at the wavelength of 70 m according to fig 28b in the heave dof the diffraction force acting on the shuttle tanker shows a downward trend as the wavelength increases thus considering that this case was investigated in the head sea condition and that the surge heave and pitch dofs are of significant importance in this condition the diffraction force is therefore investigated in the surge and pitch dofs for the shuttle tanker in the head sea condition to assess the variation of the diffraction force in other degrees of freedom as shown in fig 29 a and b by increasing the wavelength the surge and pitch diffraction forces increase the bar chart in fig 30 compares the peak diffraction forces in the three degrees of freedom mentioned above as can be observed the diffraction force in the heave degree of freedom has a much larger share in comparison to those in other degrees of freedom in the following the dynamic responses of the shuttle tanker in the head sea condition are assessed at different wavelengths in the surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom fig 31 shows the dynamic responses of the shuttle tanker in the surge heave and pitch dofs additionally fig 32 shows the peak oscillations of the tanker in the time domain at various wavelengths figs 31a and 32 show that the peak dynamic response of the tanker in the surge dof increases by 1 4 times as the wavelength increases from 70 to 130 figs 31b and 32 indicate an increase in the vertical oscillations of the vessel with increasing the wavelength such that the peak heave motions response increases from 3 23 m to 3 68 m when the wavelength increased from 70 to 130 m moreover figs 31c and 32 show that the pitch motion response increases by 1 58 times as the wavelength increases from 70 to 130 m 6 conclusion the hydrodynamic performance of two vessels multi body case a floating production storage and offloading fpso and a shuttle tanker was investigated under the environmental conditions of the caspian sea using the numerical boundary element method bem in different positions of shuttle tanker relative to the fpso the most important results obtained in this study are as follows among different vertical center to center distances of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso from 80 m to 440 m and considering the analysis of the forces in six degrees of freedom the maximum and minimum total diffraction forces occurred at the distances of 220 and 400 m between the centers of the two vessels respectively changing the vertical distance between the centers of the two vessels has no effect on the calculated froude krylov force in this regard by increasing the vertical distance the calculated froude krylov forces in both time and frequency domains do not change when the shuttle tanker is located at the vertical distance of 400 m relative to the fpso the responses of the two vessels for the multi body case and in irregular wave conditions indicate an increase in the surge and pitch responses for the fpso and a decrease in these responses for the shuttle tanker in addition by examining the variation of the mooring line tension and the heave dof it is found that the results obtained for the multi body case are not significantly different from those obtained for the single body case in the multi body case the sway and roll oscillations of the shuttle tanker decrease and its yaw oscillations increase in comparison to those in the single body case when the centers of the two vessels are 400 m apart the position of the tanker at a 60 degree angle relative to the positive direction of the x axis creates a critical situation in the three conditions of the head sea beam sea and quartering sea in the 90 degree position of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso within the horizontal radius of 400 m the shuttle tanker s stern is exposed to the incident waves the diffraction and froude krylov forces are large for that vessel when the environmental forces are applied to side of the vessel therefore the highest diffraction and froude krylov forces are observed in the head sea condition for the shuttle tanker and in the beam sea condition for the fpso in the head sea condition for the 90 degree position of the shuttle tanker relative to the fpso within the radius of 400 m the dynamic responses of the vessel in the surge heave and pitch dofs increase by increasing the wavelength moreover the surge and pitch diffraction forces increase and the heave diffraction force decreases credit authorship contribution statement shima tafazzoli conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data curation writing original

rotating propellers that combines traditional shafting propellers and the podded propulsion system due to its high efficiency excellent maneuverability low excitation force and low exhaust emissions it has become a research focus in ship propulsion systems within the green ships context guo et al 2013 sheng and xiong 2012 xiong et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 abb inc was the first to launch the hybrid crp podded propulsion system in 2001 and they applied it to two japanese high speed ro ro passenger crafts named hamanasu and akashia in 2004 ueda et al 2004 according to the one year voyage data the hybrid crp podded propulsion system exhibited an 8 enhancement in energy utilization efficiency a 15 improvement in propulsion efficiency and a 10 reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional diesel engine propulsion compared with their sister vessels these two vessels were 1 knot faster and saved 6 5 tons of fuel per day on average the hybrid crp podded propulsion systems were studied intensively by sasaki et al 2006 2009 during 2006 2009 using model based testing methods which has resulted in a design method that was developed for this type of propulsion systems in 2010 shimamoto et al 2011 evaluated the overall performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system according to their findings container vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion performed better in terms of power savings and maneuverability than those with traditional single screw propulsion when performing an open water test on the hybrid crp podded propulsion system in 2011 chang and go 2010 found that the effect of the rear propeller on the front propeller was negligible on that basis a novel prediction method for the propulsive performance of crp systems was proposed in a study conducted by quereda et al 2012 in 2012 the design method for model based testing on the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was described in detail a speed prediction method for vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion was developed the authors suggested that it could be applied to any hybrid propulsion system in 2013 a method to extend the data collected from the hydrodynamic performance test on the hybrid crp podded propulsion system to full scale propulsion systems was presented by sánchez caja et al 2013 they also suggested the use of the contracted loaded tip clt propeller as the front propeller of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system based on a hydrodynamic energy conservation perspective by improving the iteration method and the wake model wang et al 2016a 2017 developed an integral panel method to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system compared with the experimental data the proposed method showed a higher accuracy in addition they also observed the cavities generated by the hybrid crp podded propulsion system in the cavitation tunnel and analyzed the mutual interference between the front and rear propellers and the pod in detail in a study by wang et al 2016b c the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model were utilized to calculate the open water performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system and to perform a detailed analysis of the mutual interference between the front and rear propellers and the pod they also looked at the influence of major design parameters on the hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system and further examined the changes in the scale effect of the hydrodynamic performance on that basis a prediction method for the hydrodynamic performance of the full scale hybrid crp podded propulsion system was proposed a numerical method was used by xu et al 2017 2018 to investigate the unsteady hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system under steering conditions their findings indicated that the rear propeller thrust the horizontal force on the pod and steering moment increased with the steering angle and the front propeller thrust basically remained invariant with the pod steering the rear propeller and the pod had negligible effects on the cavities generated by the front propeller whereas the cavities generated by the rear propeller were affected by the front propeller the pod and the steering angle moreover the cavitation area changed with the fluctuation of the circumferential angle in a study by ren et al 2017 the hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system under steering conditions was investigated by means of numerical calculations in combination with model based testing based on which the influence of the pod propulsor deflection angle on the hydrodynamic properties of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system rear propeller and pod propulsor the efficiency of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system as well as the change in the lateral force of the pod propulsor with its deflection angle were identified a test on the hydrodynamic and cavitation performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system under the condition of propulsor deflection was conducted by li et al 2019 the research showed that the thrust torque coefficient and cavity form of the front propeller were almost unaffected by pod propulsor deflection whereas the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the rear propeller increased with the deflection angle under deflection conditions the hub and tip vortices of the front propeller flowed to the rear propeller blades causing massive cavitation on the surfaces of the rear propeller blades the cavitation area of the rear propeller varied at different circumferential positions the tip vortex of the rear propeller showed differences at the two sides of the pod body based on existing testing procedures the international towing tank conference ittc 7 5 02 03 01 6 hybrid contra rotating shaft pod propulsors model test was introduced by the 27th ittc propulsion committee the propulsion committee 2014 according to this procedure the propulsion solutions with different front rear propeller revolution rate ratios should be taken into account when doing open water tests and self propulsion tests on hybrid crp podded propulsion systems specifically open water tests should include three propulsion modes single front propeller propulsion single pod the rear propeller propulsion and hybrid crp podded propulsion the hybrid crp podded propulsion system should be considered as a whole unit with a fixed revolution rate ratio equivalent to single screw propulsion in self propulsion tests during which the solutions with multiple revolution rate ratios must be considered experimental tests have been used by the majority of researchers to study the open water and self propulsion performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system as an emerging propulsion mode developed in recent years but theoretical and numerical methods have been seldom used for the performance prediction by drawing on the equivalent single propeller method that was developed to predict the self propulsion performance of vessels with a contra rotating propeller the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was assumed to be equivalent to an equally loaded single propeller in this study the self propulsion performance of 4000 teu container vessels with single propeller and single rudder propulsion and hybrid crp podded propulsion were compared using the rans method together with the sst k ω turbulence model and sliding mesh method in addition detailed analysis of the self propulsion characteristics of vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion is presented 2 numerical simulation model in this study the numerical calculating object is a 4000 teu container vessel that was originally equipped with single screw and single rudder propulsion unit the marine design and research institute of china performed a self propulsion test using this vessel and detailed data were obtained the self propulsion test was performed at a scale ratio of λ 1 63 a model ship speed of 1 62 m s and a froude number of fr 0 2525 which corresponded to a full scale ship s speed of 25 kn the principal dimensions of the 4000 teu vessel are given in table 1 the model test arrangement is shown in fig 1 and the position of the rudder installation is shown in fig 2 mau 5 blade propellers were used and their specific parameters are listed in table 2 the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was designed by the naval university of engineering the key parameters of the pod and the front and rear propellers were determined based on the publication by wang et al 2016b the profile of the hull and the propulsor is shown in fig 3 multi block structured grids were constructed to discretize the computational domain the grids were refined at the bow stern pod and propeller rotating areas to correctly simulate the complex flow conditions periodic cylindrical structured meshes were divided at the front and rear propellers with a diameter of 1 2d f d f was the diameter of the front propeller boundary layer meshes were generated near the hull pod and propeller the y of the first layer of the meshes was about 80 the growth rate of the boundary layer was 1 05 in total there were about nine million elements in the whole computational domain the mesh distribution at the hull pod and propeller are presented in fig 4 similarly multi block structured grids were constructed to discretize the computational domain in the self propulsion calculation of the single screw vessel and there were about eight million elements in this case the grids at the surfaces of the rudder and the propeller are shown in fig 5 in the coordinate system the positive x axis points to the bow of the vessel the positive y axis points to the port side and the positive z axis points vertically upward the computational domain is shown in fig 6 the upstream inlet was equal to the vessel length from the bow the downstream outlet was 2 5 times the vessel length from the stern and the outer side surface was equal to the vessel length from the middle of the vessel the boundary conditions were as follows the upstream inlet was a velocity inlet where a constant inflow speed was specified the downstream outlet was a pressure outlet where turbulence was neglected symmetric boundary conditions were applied to the upper boundary sides and middle surface no slip impenetrable wall boundary conditions were utilized on the hull and the propellers based on the sst k ω turbulence model the governing equation and the turbulence model were discretized by the finite volume method both the convective and diffusion terms were discretized using the second order upwind scheme the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent simplec method was used for pressure velocity coupling the flow around the rotating propeller can be predicted via the moving reference frame mrf method sliding mesh method and body force method farkas et al 2018 compared with the mrf method and body force method the sliding mesh method can give a better prediction of the unsteady viscous flow around the rotating propeller by taking the propeller geometry into consideration but it consumes extensive time in this paper the sliding mesh method was used to simulate actual propeller rotation in order to achieve faster convergence a steady state method was used first followed by an unsteady state method after convergence the time step was set as the time for the propeller to rotate by 1 3 numerical calculation for self propulsion factors 3 1 numerical calculation for self propulsion factor of single screw vessel the reynolds number of the model scale and full scale ships did not satisfy the similarity relationship in the self propulsion numerical simulation a frictional resistance correction must be carried out to ensure the load on the model propeller that is equal to that on the full scale propeller thus skin friction correction at the ship self propulsion point f d must be applied to the model vessel 1 f d 1 2 ρ s m v m 2 c f m c f s δ c f where ρ is the fluid density s m is the wetted surface area of the model vessel c f m and c f s are the frictional resistance coefficients of the model scale and full scale vessel respectively and δ c f is roughness allowance according to the recommendation of the 19th ittc the roughness allowance is 2 δ c f 0 044 k s l p p 1 3 10 re 1 3 1 25 10 4 where k s is the apparent height of the hull surface roughness which is usually 150 μm for steel and l p p is the length between perpendiculars at the self propulsion point the force on the self propelled model vessel can be represented as 3 t m r m f d r v m r w m f d where r m is the total resistance of the model vessel at the self propulsion point r v m is the viscous resistance r w m is the wave making resistance and t m is the thrust generated by the propeller the viscous resistance r v m and the propeller thrust t m of the self propulsion model vessel are functions of the rate of propeller revolution n m when the ratio of immersion depth to propeller diameter is over 2 the working propeller has little influence on the wave making resistance of the vessel wang 2010 therefore r w m is assumed to be unrelated to the propeller rate of revolution and equal to the wave making resistance without propellers it can be obtained using the separating calculation method presented by liu et al 2010 hence the self propulsion point of the model vessel can be determined using a method with a fixed vehicle speed and varying rate of revolution applied in model based testing specifically the calculation is performed at different rates of revolution as a constant vessel speed the variations of the propeller thrust t m and skin friction correction at the ship self propulsion point r m f d with the rate of propeller revolution n m are plotted the intersection point of the two curves represents the self propulsion point based on the above analysis the numerical calculation of the self propulsion factor of the single screw vessel is summarized as follows 1 numerical simulation for the free surface and double body viscous flow fields of the model scale vessel without propellers were carried out separately to obtain the wave making resistance r w m and viscous resistance r v m 0 2 the open water performance of the propeller was calculated 3 numerical simulation for the viscous flow field of the model scale vessel with a propeller was conducted a fixed vehicle speed with varying rate of revolution was used to determine the self propulsion point and obtain the viscous resistance r v m against the propeller the propeller thrust t m and the propeller torque q m furthermore the advance coefficient thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the propeller were calculated as j v m n m d m k t t m ρ n m 2 d m 4 and k q q m ρ n m 2 d m 5 respectively 4 j 0 k q 0 and η 0 were obtained on the curve of the propeller open water performance by setting k t 0 k t the effective wake fraction and the relative rotational efficiency were calculated as ω m 1 j 0 j and η r k q 0 k q respectively 5 the thrust deduction fraction was calculated as t m r v m r v m 0 t m 6 the hull efficiency and the overall propulsive efficiency were calculated as η h 1 t m 1 ω m and η d η r η h η 0 respectively the above method for calculating the self propulsion factor of the single screw vessel is simple and efficient and works well when the model ship is towed in a low froude number fr 0 4 however the drawback is that the self propulsion factor is calculated without considering the free surface effect in fact the magnitude of n m is considered to be proportional to that of inflow velocity on the propeller plane and those of t m and q m are also proportional to that of n m the inflow velocity on the propeller disc is increased due to the wave effect this will be further discussed in section 4 as a result the computational values of n m t m and q m obtained from the double body model are expected to be under predicted when compared with those of the free surface model 3 2 numerical calculation for self propulsion factor of vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was treated as an integrated unit and the pod was not an independent appendage conventional self propulsion tests of single screw vessels were applied here however the difference in this section was that the single propeller was replaced by the hybrid crp podded propulsion system the advance coefficient j thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and open water coefficient η 0 were defined as follows 4 j v a n f d f 5 k t t ρ n f 2 d f 4 t f t a r p o d ρ n f 2 d f 4 6 k q n f q f n a q a ρ n f 3 d f 5 7 η 0 t f t u v a 2 π n f q f n a q a where ρ is the fluid density v a is the inflow velocity n f is the rate of revolution of the front propeller n a is the rate of revolution the rear propeller d f is the front propeller diameter d a is the rear propeller diameter q f is the front propeller torque q a is the rear propeller torque t f is the front propeller thrust t a is the rear propeller thrust and r p o d is the resistance against the pod because the hybrid crp podded propulsion system features an independent power input there can be several different revolution rate ratios at a certain vessel speed however only one of the solutions satisfies the required front rear propeller power distribution in this study the following method was used to determine the revolution rate ratio 1 a self propulsion test with different revolution rate ratios at a certain vessel speed was carried out the self propulsion point of each revolution rate ratio could be determined by the following method a with the vessel speed and the rate of revolution of the front propeller n f m fixed the overall propeller calculation for multiple rates of revolution of the rear propeller was conducted the variations of the propeller thrust t m and the compelling force r m f d of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system with rate of revolution of the rear propeller n a m were plotted the intersection point of the two curves was the self propulsion point at the revolution rate ratio of n a m n f m b the self propulsion point of each revolution rate ratio could be obtained by changing the rate of revolution of the front propeller n f m and repeating step a 2 at the self propulsion point of each revolution rate ratio the rate of revolution of the front propeller n f m the front propeller torque q f m the rate of revolution of the rear propeller n a m and the rear propeller torque q a m were acquired to calculate the power percentage of the pod propulsor in the whole hybrid crp podded propulsion system power percentage 2 π n a m q a m 2 π n f m q f m 2 π n a m q a m 3 the variation of the power percentage with the revolution rate ratio was plotted the final revolution rate ratio was determined based on the designed power distribution after the designed revolution rate ratio was determined the open water performance and the self propulsion performance of the hybrid crp propulsion system at this revolution rate ratio were numerically calculated the self propulsion factor was calculated using the method presented by quereda et al 2012 4 uncertainty analysis of numerical calculation based on the numerical calculation uncertainty analysis method noted in the ittc quality manual 7 5 03 01 01 ittc quality manual 2008 the viscous resistance coefficient of the 4000 teu container vessel without a propeller total resistance coefficient and self propulsion factor of the 4000 teu container vessel with a single mau propeller underwent uncertainty analysis without considering the free surface three types of meshes coarse medium and fine were tested the meshes were refined progressively in three directions at a refinement ratio of r g 1 2 to ensure the dimensionless distance y of the first layer mesh near the middle of the vessel was not greater than 300 the numerical calculation results of the coarse medium and fine meshes were denoted as s g c s g m and s g f respectively the difference between the results of the coarse and medium meshes and that between the results of medium and fine meshes were defined respectively as follows 8 ε g m c s g m s g c 9 ε g f m s g f s g m the mesh convergence ratio r g was calculated by 10 r g ε g f m ε g m c the accuracy order p g of the solution was calculated by 11 p g l n ε g m c ε g f m ln r g the correction factor c g was calculated by 12 c g r g p g 1 r g 2 1 for each type of mesh the uncertainty was 13 u g c g ε g f m r g p g 1 1 c g ε g f m r g p g 1 the numerical results of the viscous resistance coefficient of the 4000 teu container vessel are shown in table 3 the numerical results of the total resistance coefficient and self propulsion factors of the 4000 teu container vessel with a single mau propeller are shown in table 4 the parameters used to verify the numerical uncertainty analysis of the viscous resistance coefficient are listed in table 5 the parameters used to verify the numerical uncertainty analysis of the total resistance coefficient and self propulsion factors are listed in table 6 tables 5 and 6 show that all the mesh convergence factors r g were smaller than 1 suggesting that the mesh convergence was satisfactory the comparison between the numerical calculation result of the axial wake distribution of the medium mesh and experimental data is presented in fig 7 it can be seen that the numerical results were consistent with the measurements comparisons of non dimensional axial velocity on the propeller disc between experimental data and numerical results with and without free surface are shown in fig 8 in fig 8 efd represents experimental data 0 is the angular position of 12 o clock and the positive direction is clockwise from the stern to bow it can be seen from fig 8 that the non dimensional axial velocity agrees well with experimental data especially in the inner radius the maximum error of velocity peak amplitude is less than 10 experimental data can hardly maintain symmetry due to the circumferential measurements on the whole propeller disc while numerical results are completely symmetric to the center plane because a half of the model is calculated in the simulation the inflow velocity on the propeller disc is increased due to the wave effect the dominant difference between numerical results with and without a free surface is less than 4 thus the free surface effect is relatively small on nominal wake field at the propeller disc this was consistent with the results obtained by choi et al 2010 according to the results the subsequent numerical simulations were carried out using medium meshes to ensure calculation accuracy and maximize the calculation efficiency 5 results and discussion the thrust coefficient k t p and torque coefficient k q of the podded propeller and the thrust coefficient k t u of the pod unit were defined respectively as follows 14 k t p t p ρ n 2 d 4 15 k t u t u ρ n 2 d 4 t p r pod ρ n 2 d 4 16 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where ρ is the fluid density n is the rate of revolution of the podded propeller d is the diameter of the podded propeller q is the torque of the podded propeller t p is the thrust of the podded propeller and r p o d is the resistance against the pod 5 1 numerical calculation result of self propulsion performance of single screw 4000 teu container vessel according to the method presented in section 3 1 the wave making resistance against the hull r w m the viscous resistance r v m 0 and the open water performance of the propeller were calculated in addition self propulsion calculations for several rates of revolution were conducted to obtain the thrust t m and the torque q m of the propeller as well as the skin friction correction r m f d on it the open water performance of the propeller is shown in fig 9 the comparison between the numerical calculation result and experimental data of the self propulsion factor is shown in table 7 the numerical calculation results of the thrust deduction fraction and the effective wake fraction were in good agreement with the experimental data suggesting that the numerical method for the self propulsion factor of the model vessel was practicable the variations of the thrust and torque coefficients of the propeller with the phase angle at the self propulsion point are presented in fig 10 the numerical results showed good repeatability within one cycle the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient changed cyclically with the phase angle at a frequency that was equal to the number of propeller blades the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust coefficient was about 5 3 of the average and that of the torque coefficient was about 3 9 of the average further analysis of the propeller induced fluctuating pressure on the hull was performed the positions of the fluctuating pressure monitoring points are shown in fig 11 as shown point p 1 was located near the hull surface right above the propeller the other points were on the same horizontal plane as p 1 the variations of the absolute pressure at the monitoring points over time within one cycle are presented in fig 12 by means of the fast fourier transform fft the frequency spectra of fluctuating pressure amplitudes were obtained fig 13 the amplitudes of the first and second order fluctuating pressure are listed in table 8 as shown in figs 12 and 13 the first order fluctuating pressure was large in amplitude at each observation point yet the second order fluctuating pressure declined rapidly and the amplitude of the high frequency component was close to zero in ascending order the amplitudes of the first order fluctuating pressure were p 4 p 5 p 2 p 3 p 1 in other words the fluctuating pressure right above the propeller blade was the largest the fluctuating pressure at the front was larger than that at the rear and the fluctuating pressure at the port side was larger than that at the starboard side 5 2 numerical calculation result of self propulsion performance of 4000 teu container vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion the numerical calculation results of the propeller model for different rates of revolution of the front propeller 14 5 15 15 5 and 16 rps are listed in table 9 according to frictional resistance correction f d 6 56 n the rates of revolution of the rear propeller corresponding to different rates of revolution of the front propeller at the self propulsion point were obtained using the linear difference method self propulsion numerical calculations were performed again and the results are presented in table 10 the variations of the power percentage with the revolution rate ratio at the designed vessel speed are shown in fig 14 the power percentage and revolution rate ratio showed an approximately linear relationship at the self propulsion point considering that the designed power distribution between the front propeller and the pod propulsor was 6 4 a satisfactory revolution rate ratio was 1 0546 according to fig 14 the open water performance curve of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system at this revolution rate ratio is shown in fig 15 based on the method introduced in section 3 2 the self propulsion factor of the model vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion was obtained table 11 to compare it with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion modes the calculation results of the single mau propeller propulsion are also listed in the table compared with the vessel with traditional single screw shafting propulsion the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion showed a 17 59 larger effective wake fraction a 40 2 smaller thrust deduction fraction and a 15 1 higher hull efficiency this was consistent with the results of self propulsion tests obtained by sasaki et al 2009 and shimamoto et al 2011 many studies have shown that the induced velocity field in front of the propeller could cause the boundary layer of the hull to deform which would have a significant impact on the effective wake field however the induced velocity was positively correlated with the loading coefficient of the propeller which meant that the induced velocity increased with the loading coefficient of the propeller according to inukai and ochi 2013 the loading coefficient of contra rotating propellers is primarily determined by the front propeller with the same thrust generation both the loading coefficient of the contra rotating propellers and the induced velocity field in front of the propeller were smaller than those of the single propeller therefore the effective wake fraction of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion was slightly larger than that of the vessel with single screw propulsion the variations of the front propeller thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system with the phase angle at the self propulsion point are shown in fig 16 the variations of the rear propeller thrust coefficient the pod unit thrust coefficient and the rear propeller torque coefficient with the phase angle at the self propulsion point are shown in fig 17 the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient of the front propeller changed cyclically with the phase angle at a frequency that was equal to the number front propeller blades the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust coefficient was about 11 4 of the average and that of the torque coefficient was about 8 2 of the average the reason for this difference was that the rear propeller had little interference with the front propeller and the inflow at the front propeller was primarily subject to the influence of the hull wake field which was similar to the single screw case fig 17 shows that the cyclic variations of the rear propeller thrust coefficient pod unit thrust coefficient and rear propeller torque coefficient decreased and there were slight fluctuations which were closely associated with the strong interference of the front propeller wake the two propulsion modes the traditional rudder propeller and the hybrid crp podded propulsion system are compared below the dimensionless axial velocity distributions of these two propulsion modes at the cross sections x l pp 0 0227 in front of the front propeller disc are shown in fig 18 the contour lines of the dimensionless axial velocity of the vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion were sparsely distributed at the cross section there was a small velocity gradient and the boundary layer of the hull was thick the dimensionless axial velocity distributions of these two propulsion modes at the cross section x l pp 0 0083 behind the rear propeller disc are shown in fig 19 the contour lines of the dimensionless axial velocity of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion on the port and starboard sides were basically symmetric in addition the velocity at the propeller wake area was larger the dimensionless axial velocity distributions of these two propulsion modes at the cross section y l pp 0 in the middle of the vessel are shown in fig 20 the differences between the wake fields of two different propulsion modes are evident compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion the stern axial velocities of the vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion were highly nonuniformly distributed with a larger velocity gradient a longer high speed wake area behind the propeller and a larger absolute velocity the stern pressure distribution is shown in fig 21 the stern pressure of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion was basically symmetrically distributed on left and right sides the high pressure area right above the propeller was larger the fluctuating pressure monitoring points mentioned in section 4 1 were observed the frequency spectra of the fluctuating pressure amplitudes at the five monitoring points are shown in fig 22 the comparison between the amplitudes of the first and second order fluctuating pressures in two different propulsion modes are presented in table 12 as shown in fig 22 there were two basic frequencies the front propeller blade frequency and the rear propeller blade frequency in the fluctuating pressure on the hull of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion all the monitoring points were placed near the front propeller in this study because the front propeller was the major factor inducing the fluctuating pressure on the hull and the amplitudes of the first and second order fluctuating pressures were much larger than the amplitudes of the other components in ascending order the amplitudes of first order fluctuating pressure were p 5 p 1 p 4 p 3 p 2 thus the fluctuating pressure right ahead of the propeller blade was the largest the fluctuating pressure at the bow was larger than that at the stern and the fluctuating pressure on the port side was larger than that on the starboard side table 12 shows that the amplitudes of the maximum fluctuating pressure on the vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion were much smaller than those on the vessel with single mau propeller propulsion at various monitoring points which was consistent with the experimental conclusion drawn by shimamoto et al 2011 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the flow field at the stern of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion was largely symmetric there was a smaller velocity gradient and it was more uniform compared with that of the vessel with single mau propeller propulsion this indicated that the hybrid crp podded propulsion helped reduce the propeller induced fluctuating pressure on the hull 6 conclusions in this study the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was investigated a numerical calculation method for the self propulsion factor of the vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion was proposed using the rans method in combination with the sst k ω turbulence model and sliding mesh method in addition the self propulsion performances of 4000 teu container vessels with traditional single screw shafting propulsion and hybrid crp podded propulsion were compared in detail the findings of the present study were as follows 1 during the self propulsion performance calculation for the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion system the propulsion system should be considered as a whole unit with a fixed revolution rate ratio equivalent to single screw propulsion and multiple revolution rate ratios must be considered 2 compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion experienced a 17 59 larger effective wake fraction a 40 2 smaller thrust deduction fraction a 15 1 higher hull efficiency and a 4 12 higher overall thrust efficiency 3 compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion showed much lower propeller induced fluctuating pressures on the hull than single screw vessels which demonstrated the high frequency and low vibration characteristics of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system 4 compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion the stern axial velocities of vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion were highly nonuniformly distributed with a larger velocity gradient a longer high speed wake area behind the propeller and a larger absolute velocity 5 compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion the contour lines of the dimensionless axial velocity of vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion were sparsely distributed at the cross section in front of the propeller disc there was a smaller velocity gradient and the boundary layer of the hull was thicker at the cross section behind the rear propeller disc the contour lines of the dimensionless axial velocity of vessels with the hybrid crp podded propulsion on the port and starboard sides were largely symmetric and the velocity in the propeller wake area was higher a comparison of the cavitation performances and the propeller induced fluctuating pressures between vessels with single screw propellers and with hybrid crp podded propulsion systems should be carried out in the future because these are important factors that affect the comfort in addition due to the importance of the scale effect of the self propulsion factor especially the effective wake fraction the self propulsion performance calculation of the full scale vessel with a hybrid crp podded propulsion system should be

rotating propellers that combines traditional shafting propellers and the podded propulsion system due to its high efficiency excellent maneuverability low excitation force and low exhaust emissions it has become a research focus in ship propulsion systems within the green ships context guo et al 2013 sheng and xiong 2012 xiong et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 abb inc was the first to launch the hybrid crp podded propulsion system in 2001 and they applied it to two japanese high speed ro ro passenger crafts named hamanasu and akashia in 2004 ueda et al 2004 according to the one year voyage data the hybrid crp podded propulsion system exhibited an 8 enhancement in energy utilization efficiency a 15 improvement in propulsion efficiency and a 10 reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional diesel engine propulsion compared with their sister vessels these two vessels were 1 knot faster and saved 6 5 tons of fuel per day on average the hybrid crp podded propulsion systems were studied intensively by sasaki et al 2006 2009 during 2006 2009 using model based testing methods which has resulted in a design method that was developed for this type of propulsion systems in 2010 shimamoto et al 2011 evaluated the overall performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system according to their findings container vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion performed better in terms of power savings and maneuverability than those with traditional single screw propulsion when performing an open water test on the hybrid crp podded propulsion system in 2011 chang and go 2010 found that the effect of the rear propeller on the front propeller was negligible on that basis a novel prediction method for the propulsive performance of crp systems was proposed in a study conducted by quereda et al 2012 in 2012 the design method for model based testing on the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was described in detail a speed prediction method for vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion was developed the authors suggested that it could be applied to any hybrid propulsion system in 2013 a method to extend the data collected from the hydrodynamic performance test on the hybrid crp podded propulsion system to full scale propulsion systems was presented by sánchez caja et al 2013 they also suggested the use of the contracted loaded tip clt propeller as the front propeller of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system based on a hydrodynamic energy conservation perspective by improving the iteration method and the wake model wang et al 2016a 2017 developed an integral panel method to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system compared with the experimental data the proposed method showed a higher accuracy in addition they also observed the cavities generated by the hybrid crp podded propulsion system in the cavitation tunnel and analyzed the mutual interference between the front and rear propellers and the pod in detail in a study by wang et al 2016b c the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model were utilized to calculate the open water performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system and to perform a detailed analysis of the mutual interference between the front and rear propellers and the pod they also looked at the influence of major design parameters on the hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system and further examined the changes in the scale effect of the hydrodynamic performance on that basis a prediction method for the hydrodynamic performance of the full scale hybrid crp podded propulsion system was proposed a numerical method was used by xu et al 2017 2018 to investigate the unsteady hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system under steering conditions their findings indicated that the rear propeller thrust the horizontal force on the pod and steering moment increased with the steering angle and the front propeller thrust basically remained invariant with the pod steering the rear propeller and the pod had negligible effects on the cavities generated by the front propeller whereas the cavities generated by the rear propeller were affected by the front propeller the pod and the steering angle moreover the cavitation area changed with the fluctuation of the circumferential angle in a study by ren et al 2017 the hydrodynamic performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system under steering conditions was investigated by means of numerical calculations in combination with model based testing based on which the influence of the pod propulsor deflection angle on the hydrodynamic properties of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system rear propeller and pod propulsor the efficiency of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system as well as the change in the lateral force of the pod propulsor with its deflection angle were identified a test on the hydrodynamic and cavitation performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system under the condition of propulsor deflection was conducted by li et al 2019 the research showed that the thrust torque coefficient and cavity form of the front propeller were almost unaffected by pod propulsor deflection whereas the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the rear propeller increased with the deflection angle under deflection conditions the hub and tip vortices of the front propeller flowed to the rear propeller blades causing massive cavitation on the surfaces of the rear propeller blades the cavitation area of the rear propeller varied at different circumferential positions the tip vortex of the rear propeller showed differences at the two sides of the pod body based on existing testing procedures the international towing tank conference ittc 7 5 02 03 01 6 hybrid contra rotating shaft pod propulsors model test was introduced by the 27th ittc propulsion committee the propulsion committee 2014 according to this procedure the propulsion solutions with different front rear propeller revolution rate ratios should be taken into account when doing open water tests and self propulsion tests on hybrid crp podded propulsion systems specifically open water tests should include three propulsion modes single front propeller propulsion single pod the rear propeller propulsion and hybrid crp podded propulsion the hybrid crp podded propulsion system should be considered as a whole unit with a fixed revolution rate ratio equivalent to single screw propulsion in self propulsion tests during which the solutions with multiple revolution rate ratios must be considered experimental tests have been used by the majority of researchers to study the open water and self propulsion performance of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system as an emerging propulsion mode developed in recent years but theoretical and numerical methods have been seldom used for the performance prediction by drawing on the equivalent single propeller method that was developed to predict the self propulsion performance of vessels with a contra rotating propeller the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was assumed to be equivalent to an equally loaded single propeller in this study the self propulsion performance of 4000 teu container vessels with single propeller and single rudder propulsion and hybrid crp podded propulsion were compared using the rans method together with the sst k ω turbulence model and sliding mesh method in addition detailed analysis of the self propulsion characteristics of vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion is presented 2 numerical simulation model in this study the numerical calculating object is a 4000 teu container vessel that was originally equipped with single screw and single rudder propulsion unit the marine design and research institute of china performed a self propulsion test using this vessel and detailed data were obtained the self propulsion test was performed at a scale ratio of λ 1 63 a model ship speed of 1 62 m s and a froude number of fr 0 2525 which corresponded to a full scale ship s speed of 25 kn the principal dimensions of the 4000 teu vessel are given in table 1 the model test arrangement is shown in fig 1 and the position of the rudder installation is shown in fig 2 mau 5 blade propellers were used and their specific parameters are listed in table 2 the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was designed by the naval university of engineering the key parameters of the pod and the front and rear propellers were determined based on the publication by wang et al 2016b the profile of the hull and the propulsor is shown in fig 3 multi block structured grids were constructed to discretize the computational domain the grids were refined at the bow stern pod and propeller rotating areas to correctly simulate the complex flow conditions periodic cylindrical structured meshes were divided at the front and rear propellers with a diameter of 1 2d f d f was the diameter of the front propeller boundary layer meshes were generated near the hull pod and propeller the y of the first layer of the meshes was about 80 the growth rate of the boundary layer was 1 05 in total there were about nine million elements in the whole computational domain the mesh distribution at the hull pod and propeller are presented in fig 4 similarly multi block structured grids were constructed to discretize the computational domain in the self propulsion calculation of the single screw vessel and there were about eight million elements in this case the grids at the surfaces of the rudder and the propeller are shown in fig 5 in the coordinate system the positive x axis points to the bow of the vessel the positive y axis points to the port side and the positive z axis points vertically upward the computational domain is shown in fig 6 the upstream inlet was equal to the vessel length from the bow the downstream outlet was 2 5 times the vessel length from the stern and the outer side surface was equal to the vessel length from the middle of the vessel the boundary conditions were as follows the upstream inlet was a velocity inlet where a constant inflow speed was specified the downstream outlet was a pressure outlet where turbulence was neglected symmetric boundary conditions were applied to the upper boundary sides and middle surface no slip impenetrable wall boundary conditions were utilized on the hull and the propellers based on the sst k ω turbulence model the governing equation and the turbulence model were discretized by the finite volume method both the convective and diffusion terms were discretized using the second order upwind scheme the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent simplec method was used for pressure velocity coupling the flow around the rotating propeller can be predicted via the moving reference frame mrf method sliding mesh method and body force method farkas et al 2018 compared with the mrf method and body force method the sliding mesh method can give a better prediction of the unsteady viscous flow around the rotating propeller by taking the propeller geometry into consideration but it consumes extensive time in this paper the sliding mesh method was used to simulate actual propeller rotation in order to achieve faster convergence a steady state method was used first followed by an unsteady state method after convergence the time step was set as the time for the propeller to rotate by 1 3 numerical calculation for self propulsion factors 3 1 numerical calculation for self propulsion factor of single screw vessel the reynolds number of the model scale and full scale ships did not satisfy the similarity relationship in the self propulsion numerical simulation a frictional resistance correction must be carried out to ensure the load on the model propeller that is equal to that on the full scale propeller thus skin friction correction at the ship self propulsion point f d must be applied to the model vessel 1 f d 1 2 ρ s m v m 2 c f m c f s δ c f where ρ is the fluid density s m is the wetted surface area of the model vessel c f m and c f s are the frictional resistance coefficients of the model scale and full scale vessel respectively and δ c f is roughness allowance according to the recommendation of the 19th ittc the roughness allowance is 2 δ c f 0 044 k s l p p 1 3 10 re 1 3 1 25 10 4 where k s is the apparent height of the hull surface roughness which is usually 150 μm for steel and l p p is the length between perpendiculars at the self propulsion point the force on the self propelled model vessel can be represented as 3 t m r m f d r v m r w m f d where r m is the total resistance of the model vessel at the self propulsion point r v m is the viscous resistance r w m is the wave making resistance and t m is the thrust generated by the propeller the viscous resistance r v m and the propeller thrust t m of the self propulsion model vessel are functions of the rate of propeller revolution n m when the ratio of immersion depth to propeller diameter is over 2 the working propeller has little influence on the wave making resistance of the vessel wang 2010 therefore r w m is assumed to be unrelated to the propeller rate of revolution and equal to the wave making resistance without propellers it can be obtained using the separating calculation method presented by liu et al 2010 hence the self propulsion point of the model vessel can be determined using a method with a fixed vehicle speed and varying rate of revolution applied in model based testing specifically the calculation is performed at different rates of revolution as a constant vessel speed the variations of the propeller thrust t m and skin friction correction at the ship self propulsion point r m f d with the rate of propeller revolution n m are plotted the intersection point of the two curves represents the self propulsion point based on the above analysis the numerical calculation of the self propulsion factor of the single screw vessel is summarized as follows 1 numerical simulation for the free surface and double body viscous flow fields of the model scale vessel without propellers were carried out separately to obtain the wave making resistance r w m and viscous resistance r v m 0 2 the open water performance of the propeller was calculated 3 numerical simulation for the viscous flow field of the model scale vessel with a propeller was conducted a fixed vehicle speed with varying rate of revolution was used to determine the self propulsion point and obtain the viscous resistance r v m against the propeller the propeller thrust t m and the propeller torque q m furthermore the advance coefficient thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the propeller were calculated as j v m n m d m k t t m ρ n m 2 d m 4 and k q q m ρ n m 2 d m 5 respectively 4 j 0 k q 0 and η 0 were obtained on the curve of the propeller open water performance by setting k t 0 k t the effective wake fraction and the relative rotational efficiency were calculated as ω m 1 j 0 j and η r k q 0 k q respectively 5 the thrust deduction fraction was calculated as t m r v m r v m 0 t m 6 the hull efficiency and the overall propulsive efficiency were calculated as η h 1 t m 1 ω m and η d η r η h η 0 respectively the above method for calculating the self propulsion factor of the single screw vessel is simple and efficient and works well when the model ship is towed in a low froude number fr 0 4 however the drawback is that the self propulsion factor is calculated without considering the free surface effect in fact the magnitude of n m is considered to be proportional to that of inflow velocity on the propeller plane and those of t m and q m are also proportional to that of n m the inflow velocity on the propeller disc is increased due to the wave effect this will be further discussed in section 4 as a result the computational values of n m t m and q m obtained from the double body model are expected to be under predicted when compared with those of the free surface model 3 2 numerical calculation for self propulsion factor of vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was treated as an integrated unit and the pod was not an independent appendage conventional self propulsion tests of single screw vessels were applied here however the difference in this section was that the single propeller was replaced by the hybrid crp podded propulsion system the advance coefficient j thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and open water coefficient η 0 were defined as follows 4 j v a n f d f 5 k t t ρ n f 2 d f 4 t f t a r p o d ρ n f 2 d f 4 6 k q n f q f n a q a ρ n f 3 d f 5 7 η 0 t f t u v a 2 π n f q f n a q a where ρ is the fluid density v a is the inflow velocity n f is the rate of revolution of the front propeller n a is the rate of revolution the rear propeller d f is the front propeller diameter d a is the rear propeller diameter q f is the front propeller torque q a is the rear propeller torque t f is the front propeller thrust t a is the rear propeller thrust and r p o d is the resistance against the pod because the hybrid crp podded propulsion system features an independent power input there can be several different revolution rate ratios at a certain vessel speed however only one of the solutions satisfies the required front rear propeller power distribution in this study the following method was used to determine the revolution rate ratio 1 a self propulsion test with different revolution rate ratios at a certain vessel speed was carried out the self propulsion point of each revolution rate ratio could be determined by the following method a with the vessel speed and the rate of revolution of the front propeller n f m fixed the overall propeller calculation for multiple rates of revolution of the rear propeller was conducted the variations of the propeller thrust t m and the compelling force r m f d of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system with rate of revolution of the rear propeller n a m were plotted the intersection point of the two curves was the self propulsion point at the revolution rate ratio of n a m n f m b the self propulsion point of each revolution rate ratio could be obtained by changing the rate of revolution of the front propeller n f m and repeating step a 2 at the self propulsion point of each revolution rate ratio the rate of revolution of the front propeller n f m the front propeller torque q f m the rate of revolution of the rear propeller n a m and the rear propeller torque q a m were acquired to calculate the power percentage of the pod propulsor in the whole hybrid crp podded propulsion system power percentage 2 π n a m q a m 2 π n f m q f m 2 π n a m q a m 3 the variation of the power percentage with the revolution rate ratio was plotted the final revolution rate ratio was determined based on the designed power distribution after the designed revolution rate ratio was determined the open water performance and the self propulsion performance of the hybrid crp propulsion system at this revolution rate ratio were numerically calculated the self propulsion factor was calculated using the method presented by quereda et al 2012 4 uncertainty analysis of numerical calculation based on the numerical calculation uncertainty analysis method noted in the ittc quality manual 7 5 03 01 01 ittc quality manual 2008 the viscous resistance coefficient of the 4000 teu container vessel without a propeller total resistance coefficient and self propulsion factor of the 4000 teu container vessel with a single mau propeller underwent uncertainty analysis without considering the free surface three types of meshes coarse medium and fine were tested the meshes were refined progressively in three directions at a refinement ratio of r g 1 2 to ensure the dimensionless distance y of the first layer mesh near the middle of the vessel was not greater than 300 the numerical calculation results of the coarse medium and fine meshes were denoted as s g c s g m and s g f respectively the difference between the results of the coarse and medium meshes and that between the results of medium and fine meshes were defined respectively as follows 8 ε g m c s g m s g c 9 ε g f m s g f s g m the mesh convergence ratio r g was calculated by 10 r g ε g f m ε g m c the accuracy order p g of the solution was calculated by 11 p g l n ε g m c ε g f m ln r g the correction factor c g was calculated by 12 c g r g p g 1 r g 2 1 for each type of mesh the uncertainty was 13 u g c g ε g f m r g p g 1 1 c g ε g f m r g p g 1 the numerical results of the viscous resistance coefficient of the 4000 teu container vessel are shown in table 3 the numerical results of the total resistance coefficient and self propulsion factors of the 4000 teu container vessel with a single mau propeller are shown in table 4 the parameters used to verify the numerical uncertainty analysis of the viscous resistance coefficient are listed in table 5 the parameters used to verify the numerical uncertainty analysis of the total resistance coefficient and self propulsion factors are listed in table 6 tables 5 and 6 show that all the mesh convergence factors r g were smaller than 1 suggesting that the mesh convergence was satisfactory the comparison between the numerical calculation result of the axial wake distribution of the medium mesh and experimental data is presented in fig 7 it can be seen that the numerical results were consistent with the measurements comparisons of non dimensional axial velocity on the propeller disc between experimental data and numerical results with and without free surface are shown in fig 8 in fig 8 efd represents experimental data 0 is the angular position of 12 o clock and the positive direction is clockwise from the stern to bow it can be seen from fig 8 that the non dimensional axial velocity agrees well with experimental data especially in the inner radius the maximum error of velocity peak amplitude is less than 10 experimental data can hardly maintain symmetry due to the circumferential measurements on the whole propeller disc while numerical results are completely symmetric to the center plane because a half of the model is calculated in the simulation the inflow velocity on the propeller disc is increased due to the wave effect the dominant difference between numerical results with and without a free surface is less than 4 thus the free surface effect is relatively small on nominal wake field at the propeller disc this was consistent with the results obtained by choi et al 2010 according to the results the subsequent numerical simulations were carried out using medium meshes to ensure calculation accuracy and maximize the calculation efficiency 5 results and discussion the thrust coefficient k t p and torque coefficient k q of the podded propeller and the thrust coefficient k t u of the pod unit were defined

self propulsion performance of single screw 4000 teu container vessel according to the method presented in section 3 1 the wave making resistance against the hull r w m the viscous resistance r v m 0 and the open water performance of the propeller were calculated in addition self propulsion calculations for several rates of revolution were conducted to obtain the thrust t m and the torque q m of the propeller as well as the skin friction correction r m f d on it the open water performance of the propeller is shown in fig 9 the comparison between the numerical calculation result and experimental data of the self propulsion factor is shown in table 7 the numerical calculation results of the thrust deduction fraction and the effective wake fraction were in good agreement with the experimental data suggesting that the numerical method for the self propulsion factor of the model vessel was practicable the variations of the thrust and torque coefficients of the propeller with the phase angle at the self propulsion point are presented in fig 10 the numerical results showed good repeatability within one cycle the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient changed cyclically with the phase angle at a frequency that was equal to the number of propeller blades the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust coefficient was about 5 3 of the average and that of the torque coefficient was about 3 9 of the average further analysis of the propeller induced fluctuating pressure on the hull was performed the positions of the fluctuating pressure monitoring points are shown in fig 11 as shown point p 1 was located near the hull surface right above the propeller the other points were on the same horizontal plane as p 1 the variations of the absolute pressure at the monitoring points over time within one cycle are presented in fig 12 by means of the fast fourier transform fft the frequency spectra of fluctuating pressure amplitudes were obtained fig 13 the amplitudes of the first and second order fluctuating pressure are listed in table 8 as shown in figs 12 and 13 the first order fluctuating pressure was large in amplitude at each observation point yet the second order fluctuating pressure declined rapidly and the amplitude of the high frequency component was close to zero in ascending order the amplitudes of the first order fluctuating pressure were p 4 p 5 p 2 p 3 p 1 in other words the fluctuating pressure right above the propeller blade was the largest the fluctuating pressure at the front was larger than that at the rear and the fluctuating pressure at the port side was larger than that at the starboard side 5 2 numerical calculation result of self propulsion performance of 4000 teu container vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion the numerical calculation results of the propeller model for different rates of revolution of the front propeller 14 5 15 15 5 and 16 rps are listed in table 9 according to frictional resistance correction f d 6 56 n the rates of revolution of the rear propeller corresponding to different rates of revolution of the front propeller at the self propulsion point were obtained using the linear difference method self propulsion numerical calculations were performed again and the results are presented in table 10 the variations of the power percentage with the revolution rate ratio at the designed vessel speed are shown in fig 14 the power percentage and revolution rate ratio showed an approximately linear relationship at the self propulsion point considering that the designed power distribution between the front propeller and the pod propulsor was 6 4 a satisfactory revolution rate ratio was 1 0546 according to fig 14 the open water performance curve of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system at this revolution rate ratio is shown in fig 15 based on the method introduced in section 3 2 the self propulsion factor of the model vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion was obtained table 11 to compare it with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion modes the calculation results of the single mau propeller propulsion are also listed in the table compared with the vessel with traditional single screw shafting propulsion the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion showed a 17 59 larger effective wake fraction a 40 2 smaller thrust deduction fraction and a 15 1 higher hull efficiency this was consistent with the results of self propulsion tests obtained by sasaki et al 2009 and shimamoto et al 2011 many studies have shown that the induced velocity field in front of the propeller could cause the boundary layer of the hull to deform which would have a significant impact on the effective wake field however the induced velocity was positively correlated with the loading coefficient of the propeller which meant that the induced velocity increased with the loading coefficient of the propeller according to inukai and ochi 2013 the loading coefficient of contra rotating propellers is primarily determined by the front propeller with the same thrust generation both the loading coefficient of the contra rotating propellers and the induced velocity field in front of the propeller were smaller than those of the single propeller therefore the effective wake fraction of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion was slightly larger than that of the vessel with single screw propulsion the variations of the front propeller thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system with the phase angle at the self propulsion point are shown in fig 16 the variations of the rear propeller thrust coefficient the pod unit thrust coefficient and the rear propeller torque coefficient with the phase angle at the self propulsion point are shown in fig 17 the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient of the front propeller changed cyclically with the phase angle at a frequency that was equal to the number front propeller blades the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust coefficient was about 11 4 of the average and that of the torque coefficient was about 8 2 of the average the reason for this difference was that the rear propeller had little interference with the front propeller and the inflow at the front propeller was primarily subject to the influence of the hull wake field which was similar to the single screw case fig 17 shows that the cyclic variations of the rear propeller thrust coefficient pod unit thrust coefficient and rear propeller torque coefficient decreased and there were slight fluctuations which were closely associated with the strong interference of the front propeller wake the two propulsion modes the traditional rudder propeller and the hybrid crp podded propulsion system are compared below the dimensionless axial velocity distributions of these two propulsion modes at the cross sections x l pp 0 0227 in front of the front propeller disc are shown in fig 18 the contour lines of the dimensionless axial velocity of the vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion were sparsely distributed at the cross section there was a small velocity gradient and the boundary layer of the hull was thick the dimensionless axial velocity distributions of these two propulsion modes at the cross section x l pp 0 0083 behind the rear propeller disc are shown in fig 19 the contour lines of the dimensionless axial velocity of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion on the port and starboard sides were basically symmetric in addition the velocity at the propeller wake area was larger the dimensionless axial velocity distributions of these two propulsion modes at the cross section y l pp 0 in the middle of the vessel are shown in fig 20 the differences between the wake fields of two different propulsion modes are evident compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion the stern axial velocities of the vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion were highly nonuniformly distributed with a larger velocity gradient a longer high speed wake area behind the propeller and a larger absolute velocity the stern pressure distribution is shown in fig 21 the stern pressure of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion was basically symmetrically distributed on left and right sides the high pressure area right above the propeller was larger the fluctuating pressure monitoring points mentioned in section 4 1 were observed the frequency spectra of the fluctuating pressure amplitudes at the five monitoring points are shown in fig 22 the comparison between the amplitudes of the first and second order fluctuating pressures in two different propulsion modes are presented in table 12 as shown in fig 22 there were two basic frequencies the front propeller blade frequency and the rear propeller blade frequency in the fluctuating pressure on the hull of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion all the monitoring points were placed near the front propeller in this study because the front propeller was the major factor inducing the fluctuating pressure on the hull and the amplitudes of the first and second order fluctuating pressures were much larger than the amplitudes of the other components in ascending order the amplitudes of first order fluctuating pressure were p 5 p 1 p 4 p 3 p 2 thus the fluctuating pressure right ahead of the propeller blade was the largest the fluctuating pressure at the bow was larger than that at the stern and the fluctuating pressure on the port side was larger than that on the starboard side table 12 shows that the amplitudes of the maximum fluctuating pressure on the vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion were much smaller than those on the vessel with single mau propeller propulsion at various monitoring points which was consistent with the experimental conclusion drawn by shimamoto et al 2011 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the flow field at the stern of the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion was largely symmetric there was a smaller velocity gradient and it was more uniform compared with that of the vessel with single mau propeller propulsion this indicated that the hybrid crp podded propulsion helped reduce the propeller induced fluctuating pressure on the hull 6 conclusions in this study the hybrid crp podded propulsion system was investigated a numerical calculation method for the self propulsion factor of the vessel with hybrid crp podded propulsion was proposed using the rans method in combination with the sst k ω turbulence model and sliding mesh method in addition the self propulsion performances of 4000 teu container vessels with traditional single screw shafting propulsion and hybrid crp podded propulsion were compared in detail the findings of the present study were as follows 1 during the self propulsion performance calculation for the vessel with the hybrid crp podded propulsion system the propulsion system should be considered as a whole unit with a fixed revolution rate ratio equivalent to single screw propulsion and multiple revolution rate ratios must be considered 2 compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion experienced a 17 59 larger effective wake fraction a 40 2 smaller thrust deduction fraction a 15 1 higher hull efficiency and a 4 12 higher overall thrust efficiency 3 compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion showed much lower propeller induced fluctuating pressures on the hull than single screw vessels which demonstrated the high frequency and low vibration characteristics of the hybrid crp podded propulsion system 4 compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion the stern axial velocities of vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion were highly nonuniformly distributed with a larger velocity gradient a longer high speed wake area behind the propeller and a larger absolute velocity 5 compared with the traditional single screw shafting propulsion the contour lines of the dimensionless axial velocity of vessels with hybrid crp podded propulsion were sparsely distributed at the cross section in front of the propeller disc there was a smaller velocity gradient and the boundary layer of the hull was thicker at the cross section behind the rear propeller disc the contour lines of the dimensionless axial velocity of vessels with the hybrid crp podded propulsion on the port and starboard sides were largely symmetric and the velocity in the propeller wake area was higher a comparison of the cavitation performances and the propeller induced fluctuating pressures between vessels with single screw propellers and with hybrid crp podded propulsion systems should be carried out in the future because these are important factors that affect the comfort in addition due to the importance of the scale effect of the self propulsion factor especially the effective wake fraction the self propulsion performance calculation of the full scale vessel with a hybrid crp podded propulsion system should be carried out in the future credit authorship contribution statement zhan zhi wang methodology numerical simulation writing review editing shao song min supervision validation writing original draft fei

20714,damage stability is the achilles heel for all ship types responsible for 90 of the risk to human lives in maritime accidents of large passenger ships unsinkable ship is treated as a misnomer in the maritime industry after the titanic disaster which marred the idea for ever however titanic was designed using one damage scenario whilst designing modern megaships necessitates tens of thousands of scenarios and forensic detail of the whole flooding process within a detailed internal ship model environment combining this with recent technological innovations enables methodological treatment of damage stability supporting systematic identification and consideration of risk control options rcos to curtail and control flooding by passive active protection leading to ships that are unsinkable in all practical terms developments in the subject are critically reviewed leading to the realisation that naval architects have been trying to address damage stability by treating some key elements of the problem with naïve approximation leading to solving often the wrong problem moving forward the paper describes the renewed effort in the eu funded project flare clarkson 2019 to make amends and presents an application to a large cruise ship to demonstrate that using available knowledge and technology today designing unsinkable ships is within grasp keywords damage stability direct assessment methods active and passive protection flooding risk 1 introduction damage stability failure represents 90 of the risk to human lives in maritime accidents of large passenger ships affecting over 2 billion people who travel on these ships each year and around 100 000 commercial vessels operated by 1 5 million crew inadequate damage stability has been the cause of 53 of all vessel losses over the past decade and was the primary cause of 65 of losses in 2018 fig 1 more specifically in passenger ships the maximum number of passengers carried by the largest cruise ships each year has risen dramatically almost doubling to 6800 in 2019 compared to 1999 fig 2 this means that there is now a far greater risk of fatality for people onboard from any given single accident similarly there is about 1000 damage stability linked fatalities per year according to imo msc 72 16 14 february 2000 in the general shipping industry for ships over 550 gt and an astonishing 55 000 fatalities per year considering just two groups of smaller ship sizes fishing vessels 25 000 per year imoilofao 2010 domestic ferries 30 000 per year imo 2015 analysis of 230 000 marine insurance industry claims with a value of almost 10bn between july 2013 and july 2018 clarkson 2019 shows that ship sinking collision incidents are the most expensive cause of loss for insurers accounting for 16 of the value of all claims equivalent to more than 1 5bn over this period considering the above and with general consensus by industry experts solving the damage stability problem for ships is the holy grail in naval architecture with a huge transformational impact on the design and operation of every type and size of ship and the whole maritime industry however continued reliance on traditional flooding protection measures primarily watertight subdivision dictated by imo regulations is inhibiting progress due to saturation of this form of protection in simpler words such flooding protection has a physical limit which if exceeded reaches a safety plateau that is now being felt across the industry additionally watertight subdivision consumes deck and hull space adds weight and negatively affects ergonomics all of which work to reduce vessel earning potential this place business objectives in conflict with safety objectives and consequently demands for improved safety standards are often met with resistance from industry thus inhibiting progress furthermore difficulty of application in retrospect means that there is an ever growing safety gap between existing and newbuild vessels leaving most vessels operating at inferior safety standards as such to continue improving vessel safety in a meaningful way there is pressing need to explore alternative solutions to this problem 2 background the specific background pertinent to this paper will be addressed in this section in the form of elaborating on specific related facts following which the way forward is delineated 2 1 life cycle flooding risk management the realisation that risk is inextricably linked to operation and a derivative of exposure has driven the maritime industry to life cycle considerations for effective flooding risk management key to life cycle flooding risk management is the understanding that both the operational phase monitoring and management of residual risk as well as emergencies emergency response depend crucially on having identified during the design phase pertinent design vulnerabilities that lead to critical accident scenarios in pre specified loading and environmental conditions and on the basis of this having taken appropriate measures to ensure damage protection and control to adopted tolerable levels helping in this direction is contemporary understanding of the forensic detail of design vulnerabilities for damage stability and of the ensuing behaviour of ships in extreme damage conditions pertinent to the ships being built and operated today in addition offering the industry a cost effective means for flooding risk reduction and control will incentivise adoption of higher safety standards thus providing a mechanism to fuel continuous improvement what is missing is institutionalisation of these tools methods and processes in the maritime industry and this is one of the objectives in project flare flare 2019 2022 2 2 old ships vs new ships the shipping industry is very old and consequentially very traditional damage protection in the form of watertight bulkheads was the first risk control option proposed in 1854 but it has taken many more accidents and significant loss of life including the titanic for it to be internationally adopted as solas 1929 it is more than likely that the delay was primarily because the industry was keenly aware that serving safety will compromise functionality and earnings ultimately viability of business and this contrast and conflict continues to this day this is clearly obvious in that new regulations for damage stability apply only to newbuildings grandfather clause hence assuming a 5 constant growth of the industry over the years this leaves the majority of ships existing ships with an inferior damage stability standard and damage protection a gap that widens progressively to the extent that solas becomes less and less relevant the only way that this landslide will be arrested is if cost effective active damage control measures were made available thus incentivising the industry to adopt these for life cycle damage stability flooding risk management as elaborated in the following paragraph 2 3 passive vs active protection in the quest for damage stability improvement design passive protection has traditionally been the only means to achieve this in a measurable auditable way solas 2009 ch ii 1 however it is undeniable that the consequences from inadequate damage stability can also be reduced by operational active measures which may be very effective in reducing loss of life the residual risk as a matter of fact active and passive measures for damage control have co existed almost from the outset one could imagine that in the absence of decks old seamen would have had to use buckets later on pumps and other means to empty floodwater from ship hulls plug holes with any matter of means adjust sails and so on more latterly safety equipment lsa drill teams safety centres safety masters and other active damage protection measures have been progressively introduced most in the wake of accidents so why this myopic and uncompromising focus only on passive protection there are two reasons for this the first relates to the traditional understanding that operational measures safeguard against erosion of the design safety envelop increase of residual risk over time the second derives from lack of measurement and verification of the risk reduction potential by any active measures notwithstanding this the exact contribution of active measures to safety has never been considered even as a discussion topic irrespective of how effective these might be as damage protection control options the dogma that if it cannot be measured it cannot be improved has gone a step further in the maritime industry to become if it cannot be measured it cannot be regulated hence all these options however cost effective and safety effective might be they are not being considered as a means of damage protection in the same way that passive measures are for example for passive protection we have indices of subdivision indices for damages indices for survival indices for everything there is some refreshing new ground on passenger evacuation metrics but this is still highly general some say arbitrary and incomplete novel technology qualification risk assessing and de risking the novelty offers a portal for introducing active means of damage protection and modern tools offer enhanced capability to estimate flooding risk over the life cycle even live risk on board ships this is the requisite platform to facilitate change and as stated in the foregoing project flare will facilitate a systematic and structured way to account for such developments this in turn will change the maritime safety agenda and its evolution in simple terms what is needed is the means to account for risk reduction by operational interventional means as well as measures that may be taken during emergencies such risk reduction may then be considered alongside risk reduction deriving from design measures therefore new measures for risk reduction operational and in emergencies should be considered in addition to design measures what needs to be demonstrated and justified is the level of risk reduction and a way to account for it the latter by adopting a formal process and taking requisite steps to institutionalise it 2 4 prevention vs mitigation one ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure this is almost a dogma in most fields of safety science and engineering there are however two aspects worth considering from a different perspective the first is residual risk which for large passenger ships is so excessive that reducing this must be priority for example consider the ship being investigated later on in his paper which is a 10 500 people on board pob ship in the imo fsa for cruise ships it has been proposed that risk control options for ship safety enhancement will be costed against the propensity of society to spend towards saving one life which for the western world is 8m with the a index of this ship being approximately 0 9 using imo solas 2009 and if collision had taken place the residual risk is worth with collision probability assumed as 1 0 1 x10 500 x 8m 8 4b a few times over the worth of the ship the second relates to the feasibility of preventive vs mitigating measures for effective preventive measures we should be searching far into the left of the fault tree see bow tie in fig 3 where the emphasis lies on sociotechnical organisational and safety culture matters which will require long term investment and effort to identify and bring to fruition effective rcos mitigation measures on the other hand are linked strongly to technological innovation where the strength currently lies hence solutions are likely to be of shorter term and more than likely cost effective therefore mitigation remains a key target in this respect the prevailing situation can be drastically improved through understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to vessel loss and to identification of governing design and operational parameters to target flooding risk reduction cost effectively this in turn necessitates the development and institutionalisation of appropriate methods tools and techniques capable of meaningfully addressing the physical phenomena involved another target of the eu project flare flare 2019 2022 2 5 the way forward the first key word is lifecycle the realisation that risk is inextricably linked to operation and a derivative of exposure has driven the industry to life cycle considerations for effective flooding risk management key to this is the understanding that both the operational phase monitoring and management of residual risk as well as emergencies emergency response depend crucially on having identified during the design phase pertinent design vulnerabilities which lead to critical flooding scenarios in pre specified loading and environmental conditions and on the basis of this having taken appropriate measures to ensure damage protection and control to satisfy adopted tolerability levels such measures are normally referred to as recovery control measures or mitigating and controlling measures barriers is another term fig 3 which as indicated and explained in the foregoing traditionally have focussed on passive measures of damage protection in the aftermath of the flooding accident however safety affects everything on the life cycle of a ship and is in turn affected by everything so why focusing singularly on design passive protection and ignoring any interventional active measures during normal operation and in emergencies utilising the imo probabilistic damage stability framework the provisions for alternative design and arrangements ad a imo 2006 and goal based standards and safety level approach a life cycle flooding risk based regulatory framework will enable and support a continuous evolution of regulations ensuring the risk level is alarp as low as reasonably practicable whilst providing a sound platform for benchmarking alternative novel ship and system designs and operating procedures for new and existing ships to this end a fundamental requisite is that pertinent risks need to be quantified in many cases almost in real time throughout the life cycle of the ship from design and daily operation to crisis situations consequentially there is clear need for wider consideration of measures of flooding risk mitigation and control namely active as well as passive measures of flooding protection in a way that every measure is assigned a risk metric and is accounted for in such risk assessment this is also being taken care in project flare flare 2019 2022 2 6 the way forward the second key word is holistic one of the most significant gaps in addressing flooding risk derives from the fact that emphasis on prevention has over the years been only cursory with strong emphasis on damage limitation post accident therefore the scope need not only be life cycle addressing active and passive means of damage mitigation and control but also holistic addressing both prevention and mitigation control measures through an all embracing risk based regulatory framework for damage stability flooding risk the way this is included in project flare is through the development of a risk aware susceptibility models to flooding incidents accounting for all pertinent hazards topology bathymetry traffic weather conditions and ship types leading to probabilistic estimates of flooding risk by direct assessment on this basis a typical formulation of the flooding risk will be in the form shown in eq 1 vassalos 2004 1 rf pf x pb f x psc b x ploss sc namely flooding risk probability that a flooding event has occurred x probability of hull breach conditional on the flooding event x probability of sinking capsize conditional on hull breach x probability of human life loss conditional on ship sinking capsizing the current imo probabilistic rules for damage stability addresses only part of the 2nd term namely probability of hull breach conditional on a collision event p factor and part of the 3rd term namely the compliment of the probability of capsize sinking as a result of collision only a index in solas ch ii 2 therefore flooding events as a result of side and bottom groundings are not considered and neither is the probability of having a flooding event adopting such a framework will bring together every aspect of risk prevention mitigation and control targeting a balance of all credible rcos and leading to the most cost effective means of flooding risk management 3 ec funded project flare to address the gaps and emerging needs a large consortium comprising some 20 organisations from industry academia and ros set up the research project flare flare 2019 2022 with significant funding from the eu targeting the following specific objectives the flare overriding objective is to develop a novel risk based methodology beyond the existing state of the art for live flooding risk assessment and containment in line with imo high level goals specific objectives include to collate and analyse all pertinent accident data to create a flooding incident accident database for relevant type of ships and damages use this database with support from flooding simulation tools and expert judgement to develop a generic risk model for flooding incidents accounting for collision and grounding ensure the risk model is holistic all flooding accident types all modes of loss active and passive measures hence with application potential to both newbuildings and existing ships facilitate real time flooding risk evaluation for risk monitoring and effective control in emergencies consider an all embracing risk aware approach post flooding incidents by addressing the whole spectrum of risk from susceptibility to flooding to emergency response including mustering and abandonment in pertinent flooding scenarios provide the technical basis and a proposal for the revision of relevant imo regulations towards a risk based approach to contain and control flooding incidents on this basis and accounting for state of the art table 1 summarises and contrasts current practice with flare targets and highlights the expected novelty in the flare output 4 adopted methodology for flooding risk estimation the methodology adopted has been tailored to cater for the design and implementation of pertinent risk control options preventive and mitigating and is comprised of eight distinct phases as elaborated in the following and shown in fig 4 4 1 stage 1 static dynamic stability assessments the process begins by addressing two forms of damage stability assessment in parallel one based upon conventional hydrostatic techniques and the other using advanced numerical time domain flooding simulations herein distinguished as static and dynamic approaches respectively the static component is conducted in accordance with applicable imo statutory instruments which vary depending on vessel age type and size when assessing new build vessels engaged in international voyage this relates to the requirements of either solas 2009 or solas 2020 as applicable both these forms of assessment offer a distinct advantage over deterministic instruments in that they are for the most part performance based in nature this enables a quantifiable baseline risk level to be established from which the impact of rcos can later be measured and compared unfortunately a great deal of existing ships and domestic vessels are regulated based on older prescriptive regimes with an implicit but not explicitly quantifiable safety level a secondary and complimentary assessment is also conducted at this stage utilising numerical time domain simulations as a means of addressing vessel survivability this form of assessment as in the case of solas 2009 20 is also performance based and thus well suited for evaluation of various rcos however the way vessel performance is measured differs greatly between the two approaches numerical simulations draw upon first principles and have a greater capacity to capture the underlying physics of the flooding process this means they do not suffer to the same extent from elements of assumption generalisation and simplification that are commonplace within technical standards consequently the results from numerical simulations work to not only support and verify the results of the static assessment but also offer a wealth of additional information and insight into important flooding processes and components of survivability that simply cannot be captured using statics 4 2 stages 2 4 static dynamic vulnerability assessments the second stage of the process comprises vulnerability assessments that are conducted based on the two sets of results generated in the previous stage in both cases there are three primary aims to this process namely to establish the degree of vulnerability present the nature of said vulnerability and its sources gaining such understanding is crucial in deriving rcos as any effective treatment must be founded upon accurate diagnosis both statics and dynamics offer metrics by which to gauge the degree of vulnerability those being the attained subdivision index and the survivability index the latter simply refers to the ratio of cases survived to the total number of cases considered in dynamic damage stability assessments respectively delving deeper within stage 3 the nature of the vulnerability is identified by assessing failure modes this can be achieved either through consideration of the dominant criteria in statics or by forensic investigation of the flooding sequence in dynamic assessment undertaking such analysis allows loss scenarios to be categorised as those cases in which unprotected openings or progressive flooding are responsible for loss or instead where a lack of stability or transient flooding give rise to loss it is highly important to make this distinction as both loss modalities call for very different treatments and once categorised in his manner both openings and regions within the vessel can be ranked according to their criticality here loss scenarios are defined as cases in which the survival factor is less than one or in which the vessel capsizes 4 3 stages 5 solution development this stage of the process involves targeted application of rcos here depending on the mode of loss the arest p1 and a1 solutions are utilised in the treatment of cases suffering from stability and transient flooding issues whilst the arest a2 system is employed to curtail progressive flooding see later in the paper 4 4 stages 6 7 re evaluation of static and dynamic damage stability having implemented rcos the vessel damage stability performance is re evaluated and an iterative process ensues here the residual risk is assessed in accordance with stages 2 4 in order to determine if stability safety objectives have been met failing this the updated results can be called upon in order to determine areas that may benefit from additional protection 4 5 stage 8 novel technology qualification classification the final stage in the methodology is to undergo a novel technology qualification ntq process which is the route offered by most classification societies towards the approval of new and innovative technologies this is important as currently established codes and procedures tend to be empirical by nature and thus solutions without prior precedent are ill covered if at all the overriding objective behind this process is to ensure that any rco proposed is fit for purpose and this relates to not only safety but also performance functionality and availability in addition this stage acts to test the practicality of the solution which is a highly important consideration as one does not wish to solve one problem by introducing another furthermore what could look very attractive on the page can often fail to stand up to practical scrutiny and for any research in this direction to have true value it must be applicable in practice 5 ship damage stability and survivability assessment process this section serves to provide a critical overview of the survivability assessment process as developed at the university of strathclyde over the past few decades 5 1 limitations in hydrostatics for damage stability and the need for numerical simulations flooding simulations allow for a more refined assessment of vessel damage survivability in comparison with the conventional hydrostatic calculation techniques found in the current imo regulatory instruments solas 2009 2020 this is particularly true in the case of large passenger vessels where the ability of hydrostatics to accurately assess and quantify ship survivability remains a highly contentious point vassalos addresses this specific issue in detail vassalos 2016 here he calls attention to several areas in which the current static based regulatory scheme fails to cater for cruise vessels in an appropriate manner put plainly there is a clear and observable difference between cruise vessels and ropax vessels which needs to be accounted for by some means the introduction of solas 2020 made some progress in this direction by introducing a more stringent s factor for ropax vessels in case of damage to the ro ro spaces however this alone represents the sole distinguishing element between these two ship types and is one that serves only to differentiate ropax vessels from cruise vessels and not the other way round such differentiation acts only to cater for flooding mechanisms relating specifically to ropax ships and there are no such provisions designed to cater for cruise vessels and their own specific flooding mechanisms as such some effort is required in order to bring the regulations back into harmony with reality or else other tools need be sought in order to fill this gap moreover there are also several limitations inherent in the static assessment process itself as opposed to any regulatory shortcomings or mistreatments these relate primarily to the inability of hydrostatics to accurately account for and capture different loss modalities this is highly important not only in determining risk but also in identifying appropriate rcos traditionally the attained subdivision index a index has been used in order to gauge the effectiveness of rcos either by measuring improvement in the a index itself or as an input to quantitative risk assessment qra this allows the reduction in the expected value or rate of death to be determined δpll from which rco cost effectiveness can be gauged this process allows for a relatively fair and time efficient means of ranking rcos but fails to account for the whole picture one of the fundamental philosophies behind the probabilistic approach to damage stability assessment is that two vessels with the same attained subdivision index are considered equally safe imo 2017 this is however not necessarily the case as the element of time is removed from the question if two vessels were considered each having an index of 0 8 there is no indication of the severity of the twenty percent of cases in which each vessel is lost one vessel could be prone to transient capsize and the other to progressive flooding loss in which case the casualty rate would vary dramatically and so too the risk level some effort was made to account for this in the collision risk model developed in goalds goalds 2009 2012 and more recently the emsa iii project emsa 2013 2015 here the risk model accounted for fast and slow flooding probabilities within the collision event tree but this determination was made independently of the attained subdivision index and therefore was not based on the actual behaviour of the damaged vessel furthermore there is some ambiguity surrounding what constitutes fast flooding in comparison to slow leading to the question how fast is fast and inversely how slow is slow notwithstanding the above static assessment techniques even though unable to directly distinguish between loss modalities do provide some indication firstly in order to account for transient asymmetric flooding the current regulations apply an intermediate s factor in cases where flooding is not considered instantaneous within 60 s here a quasi static approach is adopted whereby the flooding process is broken down into various stages and phases providing snapshots of the flooding process but not the full time dependent flooding progression this in turn can be used to determine if the vessel possesses a higher risk of capsize within intermediate stages of flooding thus allowing cases that could be prone to transient capsize to be identified however this quasi static treatment of intermediate flooding has long fallen into question due to the highly violent and dynamic nature of the initial flooding stages dafermos and papanikolaou 2016 in the consideration of the potential for progressive flooding the regulations work by truncating the vessel damaged gz curve at the point of immersion of unprotected openings or by considering the vessel as lost if such openings or weather tight openings were immersed at equilibrium this in turn allows cases prone to progressive flooding to be identified if limited in this way and the underlying logic here is clear as to the prevention of progressive flooding where the limitations of this approach appear is in the fact that by truncating the gz curve in this way the focus is on a small portion of the flooding chain not allowing the entire floodwater evolution to unfold knowledge of what may have happened or the consequences is lost important questions relating to the actual extent of flooding that would be realised the openings through which this would occur and the time that this would take are all left unanswered this limited scope through which the flooding process is viewed also has potential repercussions as regards the implementation of rcos for example if the focus is on the initially immersed opening in the flooding sequence and if this opening for operational reasons could not be protected the designer may reside to the fact that this is an unavoidable risk however there is every possibility that if the flooding chain could not be broken here it may very well be broken a little further within the flooding evolution and this information is all lost within the current regulatory scheme to summarise static assessment techniques provide a somewhat opaque and limited view of flooding risk and its sources consequently it is important that where possible and appropriate we support these calculations with other tools for this reason numerical time domain simulations tools are indispensable in assessing vessel survivability in the case of cruise vessels where the greatest uncertainty lies this is in line with evolving trends within the industry where given the potential severity of a major accident involving a large passenger vessel simply ensuring compliance is no longer considered sufficient king and v 2016 instead there has been a turn towards the use of first principles tools coupled with a more proactive approach that promotes continuous safety improvement over simply ensuring compliance 5 2 background on the development of simulation tools since their inception in the mid 1980s time domain flooding simulations have been used in order to gain a better understanding of complex flooding processes that cannot be captured accurately using static assessment techniques early forms of such tools were used predominantly to assess the damage survivability of ropax vessels with a focus on cross flooding and the accumulation of water on the ro ro deck such research was fuelled by a number of major accidents that occurred around this time including the loss of herald of free enterprise in 1987 and the sinking of estonia in 1994 both of which acted as catalysts for development in the understanding that something had to change one of the earliest examples of such work was the investigation conducted by spouge when assessing the sinking of the ro ro ferry european gateway spouge 1986 here he employed a quasi static simulation approach with flooding rates determined by a simple hydraulic model leading to one of the earliest reports on the effects of transient asymmetric flooding unfortunately however it became clear that the abrupt and highly dynamic nature of transient flooding could not be captured accurately using quasi statics leading to the development of an improved model in vredeveldt and journee 1991 in contrast their approach relied on a hybrid simulation model whereby roll motion was captured using dynamics whilst other less critical degrees of freedom dof were dealt with in a quasi static manner journee vermeer vredeveldt then later expanded this to account for dynamic motion in all six degrees of freedom journee et al 1997 in parallel with such developments vassalos turan turan and vassalos 1994 developed a 3dof dynamic flooding model capable of accounting for the effects of irregular seas as opposed to the calm water assumption made by the majority of other models at the time this was an important development given that 70 of accidents occur in waves and just a year later this model was further expanded in order to account for all 6dof by vassalos letizia vassalos and letizia 1995 in the years that followed such tools were further advanced and refined with papanikolaou papanikolaou et al 2000 applying the lumped mass concept in order to better account for internal floodwater dynamics and sloshing effects a concept which was further developed by jasionowski and vassalos 2001 not long after these developments the first application of numerical simulations to cruise vessels were conducted perhaps most notably recorded in vassalos and letizia 1995 and papanikolaou et al 2000 the works by vassalos vassalos et al 2004 and van t veer van t veer and d 2004 in both cases simulations were conducted on large cruise vessels accounting for motion in all six dof the breach sizes examined were in line with that used in the harder model tests namely a two compartment damage scenario about amidships of 0 033 lpp in length b 5 in penetration and spanning from above the tank top to one deck above the vessel bulkhead deck in both instances the vessel internal geometry was modelled in detail both in terms of compartmentation and in terms of openings interestingly despite the similarities between these assessments two very different sets of conclusions were drawn on the one hand van t veer concluded that cruise vessels were predominantly prone to loss of residual stability through progressive flooding rather than transient capsize in contrast vassalos alerted to the fact that cruise vessels were indeed vulnerable to transient capsize citing the multiple free surface effects that are formed in the early stages of flooding as the casual factor this should have been particularly alarming given the modest damage size and penetration examined but instead the conclusions drawn by van t veer became more widely accepted fostering the notion that cruise vessels are vulnerable only to progressive flooding consequently the question of transient flooding as regards cruise vessels had been left to sleep for many years until awoken recently in such research projects as esafe esafe 2017 2019 and flare flare 2019 2022 where the seriousness of the situation with transient flooding being left to hibernate for all these years has drastically undermined progress in damage survivability of passenger ships 5 3 survivability assessment process flare flare 2019 2022 5 3 1 preparation of the simulation model flooding simulations allow for a far greater level of detail within the vessel internal geometry to be captured in comparison to hydrostatic models here all features liable to inhibit or facilitate the flooding process are modelled with consideration of the vessel entire weathertight envelope usually spanning two or three decks above the bulkhead deck this includes the consideration of spaces such as cold rooms lift trunks ventilation trunks escape trunks stairwells a class fire rated structure and watertight divisions the result is something far more representative of the actual vessel geometry in comparison to static models which for a medium sized cruise vessel would comprise some 700 spaces as opposed to the 250 spaces one would expect to find within the static equivalent the ability to capture geometric details in this way is of particular importance concerning cruise vessels as the simplifications made within statics often lead to a very reductive representation of the vessel internal arrangement this contrasts with ropax vessels where the internal geometry is rather simple to begin with and so the level of detail lost is significantly less fig 5 below provides a comparison between the static and simulation models of a medium size cruise vessel in addition to modelling internal spaces in far greater detail simulation models also account for internal openings in a manner far more reflective of reality in general all openings linking the modelled rooms are accounted for and represented by their physical geometries doors are also assigned leakage and collapse properties in accordance with the findings of the eu project floodstand floodstand 2009 2012 here full scale tests coupled with fea analysis were conducted on several typical passenger vessel door types in order to determine their resistance to floodwater each opening is also assigned a uniform discharge coefficient of c d 0 6 which represents the industry standard for this property this coefficient represents the ratio between the actual discharge and the theoretical discharge ideal flow through a constricted opening at the time of flooding all doors are assumed to have a closed status such as to assess vessel survivability in its best state which provides a fair baseline level from which to gauge the benefits of additional rcos otherwise improvements would pertain to vessel operational risk according to its existing design i e recommending certain existing doors be closed in case of damage having followed this process the simulation model of a medium to large cruise vessel would generally contain around 1000 1500 openings as shown in fig 6 5 3 2 damage scenario definition damage scenarios have been defined by applying monte carlo sampling techniques to pertinent damage and sea state probability distributions producing damage breaches characterised by size location and environmental conditions the sample size considered varies across the assessments conducted but no less than 1500 cases have been considered for any given damage type firstly collision damages have been defined according to the distributions generated within the eu project harder harder 1999 2003 which form the basis of the current s factor applicable to all passenger ships in such cases the existing distributions have been further expanded in order to account for variation in the lower extent of damage based on the work outlined in bulian et al 2019 where other damage types have been considered namely side and bottom grounding the distributions developed within the extensive work conducted in golads papanikolaou et al 2013 and later emsa iii emsa 2013 2015 have been considered an example of collision breach sample is provided in fig 7 5 3 3 sample size in generating breaches from statistical damage distributions when generating scenarios by sampling probability distributions it is important to ensure that the sample is a fair and accurate representation of the underlying distributions the magnitude of the error incurred here is predominantly a function of the sample size and as such it is of great importance to ensure that a statistically valid sample is considered however as the sample size increases so too does the calculation time and computational cost so one must seek to strike a balance between these two competing objectives in order to make this determination the standard error of the mean has been used to ascertain sample quality and is a measure of the accuracy in which the sample mean x reflects the actual distribution mean μ calculated in accordance with equation 2 by assessing the magnitude of the standard error as a function of sample size the relationship between these two parameters can be derived normally there are diminishing returns in error reduction for sample sizes greater than 750 samples similar tendencies were identified when assessing other parameters in this way with a variation 50 samples found across all cases this indicated an optimal sample size of 700 800 samples the reason a greater sample quantity has been considered stems from the nature of the sampling process itself which provides a subset of all probable cases with proportional representation of various extents but fails to capture all possible scenarios this is part icularly true in the case of low probability events which are often poorly represented within small samples 2 s e σ n where σ sample standard deviation n number of samples in addition to considering the standard error confidence intervals have also been derived for each sample in order to illustrate the range of confidence across the sample cdf for this purpose the dvoretzky kiefer wolfowitz inequality has been utilised dvoretzky et al 1956 which allows different rates in violation to be identified across the range of the distribution equations eq 3 and eq 4 an example of how this error varies relative to sample size is also provided in fig 8 3 f n x ε f x f n x ε 4 ε l n 2 α 2 n where f x the true sample cdf f n x lower and upper bounds 1 α level of confidence i e α 0 05 for 95 confidence 5 3 4 survivability estimation the results of the flooding simulations allow the vessel survivability index to be determined which represents the ratio of cases survived to cases lost this is a time conditional value often depicted as the cumulative distribution function of time to capsize ttc shown in fig 9 here the probability of vessel capsize can be observed over time the complement of which represents the vessel probability of survival 5 3 5 forensic analysis of vessel vulnerability 5 3 5 1 determining loss modality having conducted the vessel survivability assessment described in the foregoing there will be a subset of the initial scenario sample identified as capsize cases these scenarios are then subjected to a process of detailed forensic investigation which starts at the highest level with the determination of the modality of loss this is achieved through consideration of the ttc and roll time history relating to each scenario which illustrates clearly if the vessel is lost as a result of transient effects or flooding progression over a greater period time see figs 10 and 11 this is an important first step not only in identifying the root cause of ship vulnerability but also in the development of appropriate rcos the determination of whether the vessel is lost because of transient capsize or progressive flooding has a large impact on the nature of rco that should be employed firstly there is the element of time which in the case of transient capsize would not allow a system requiring actuation to be used thus changing the focus to built in stability solutions alternatively if progressive flooding were the underlying cause of loss then the designer would best focus on the openings that facilitate such flooding as described in the following 5 3 5 2 identification of critical openings the second stage in the forensic investigation relates to the consideration of progressive flooding loss scenarios and the openings through which this flooding occurs the nature and severity of progressive flooding is dependent on the internal geometry of the vessel which is a complex environment and one in which attention to detail is of great importance at the highest level the susceptibility of a given vessel to progressive flooding can be viewed as a function of the following characteristics of its internal geometry ability to inhibit flooding progression wt door swt doors a class fire doors ability to distribute floodwater favourably i e cross flooding up flooding down flooding predominance of features that facilitate progressive flooding lift trunks vents service corridors undivided spaces given the above vulnerabilities in such cases tend to stem from local as opposed to global design features which calls for a detailed assessment of all such features the results yielded from the numerical simulations provide a lot of information on the flooding process however the difficulty comes when managing and processing this information in order to identify vulnerabilities and subsequently effective rcos one of the first ways in which this problem has been approached concerns the evaluation of case specific floodwater evolutions and the sequence of opening immersion as illustrated in fig 12 in this example the time history of floodwater mass has been superimposed with the openings that are immersed throughout the flooding progression by observing each case in this way critical openings can be identified where spikes in floodwater mass occur following their immersion in addition by assessing the flooding chain in this manner one can endeavour to break the chain at the earliest feasible stage it should be noted however that a certain degree of care needs to be taken in interpreting this information as there are both positive and negative forms of progressive flooding meaning this information cannot be viewed in isolation as such the roll response time history is often viewed in the same manner in order to determine if the immersed openings are acting to disperse floodwater favourably i e cross flooding equalisation or are they generating further asymmetry alternatively the sequence of space involvement can be called upon firstly as a means of ascertaining which spaces are involved within the flooding evolution and secondly as an indicator of positive or negative progressive flooding occurrence see fig 13 building on the above a more general approach has been developed in order to allow for a timely means of ranking openings based on their criticality this involves a three stage approach each of which focuses on a different measure of opening criticality in order to ensure all pertinent vulnerability metrics are accounted for including stage 1 frequency of occurrence in this stage all progressive flooding cases that have led to capsize are analysed in order to identify those openings that facilitate flooding progression in each case the openings identified are assessed with regards to their frequency of occurrence thus allowing their vulnerability to be ranked in this respect stage 2 net floodwater mass transfer in recognition of the fact that those openings identified in stage 1 as vulnerable may be of high frequency but low consequence a second and complimentary assessment is conducted in which the net mass of floodwater transferred through each opening is evaluated this provides a secondary measure of criticality by focusing on severity as opposed to probability of involvement stage 3 high floodwater mass transfer frequency the third and final assessment is a hybrid of the two previously outlined stages here those openings that possess both high floodwater mass transfer and frequency of involvement are considered allowing openings to be ranked based on both probability and criticality the results of this process produce a ranking of opening criticality as shown in the example of fig 14 6 adaptive reconfigurable safety technology arest systems flare flare 2019 2022 the analysis of vessel flooding vulnerability at forensic level combined with recent technological developments deriving from five years of research and application at strathclyde on the use of high expansion foam as a means of restoring lost buoyancy following accidental flooding events deriving from collision of grounding accidents enabled a systematic consideration of all loss modalities in a damaged ship and the development of systems leading to restoration of loss buoyancy under the trade name of arest systems the main options include either the deployment of high expansion foam in selected vulnerable spaces as a means of passive active protection or deployable barriers to curtail and control the process of flooding both options have been tested through several feasibility studies with industry involving new designs and existing ships and are currently undergoing approvals with class and administration the latter is ship type and ship design specific but the process is generic strathclyde university holds patents for these concepts which were developed over a 3 year scottish government funded project whilst the offering involves partnerships with the multi national foam manufacturer minova and the australian design office sea transport solutions being able to offer cost effective solutions to the damage stability problem for ships will lead to a transformational change in ship design and operation with immeasurable impact on the whole maritime industry moreover the same concept being used to address design of newbuildings will enable attention to all existing ships which are currently operating at inferior stability standards a hiccup in maritime legislation known as grandfather clause as elaborated earlier in the paper 6 1 the concept safety is normally a compromise to vessel earning potential and as public demand for higher safety standards grows industry is forced to choose between viability of business and safety of customers to address this conflict for flooding risk the in operation optimal internal arrangement of the vessel is adapted and reconfigured using passive fixed void filling foam and active deployable foam bulkheads containment systems this leads to containing the amount of floodwater entering the ship hull and spreading through the ship post flooding accidents the innovation is a simple yet highly effective flooding protection system applicable to all ship types in particular safety critical ships 6 2 arest systems adaptive reconfigurable safety technology arest systems relates to a university of strathclyde patent patent no pct gb 2017 050681 pertaining to a series of active and passive systems comprising the use of high expansion foam to restrict and contain the floodwater entering the ship hull post flooding accidents the active deployable systems also offer fire protection as per solas illustration and brief description are provided next 6 2 1 arest p1 passive foam installation permanent void filling to enhance residual stability fig 15 this is a passive flooding protection system pertaining to the installation of permanent foam in void spaces to provide additional reserve buoyancy when these spaces are damaged following a flooding incident thus increasing damage gm such installations act much like buoyancy tanks with impermeable volume to provide buoyancy when damaged within the immediate damaged area upon installation the foam adheres to the vessel steel structure and acts as a protective anti corrosive coating prohibiting build up of moisture between foam and ship structure and offering effective insulation the foam is resilient and will last without degradation for the vessel life span 6 2 2 arest a2 a2f deployable watertight bulkheads for flooding fire protection fig 16 during the flooding process of a complex internal environment the internal geometry of a ship and the progressive flooding paths therein can be likened to the cardiovascular system of the human anatomy in this respect there exist minor progressive flooding paths that act much like veins and major progressive floodwater paths that act like arteries in order to most effectively deal with progressive flooding in ships it is best to focus on blocking these arteries in this schematic representation of a complex internal ship environment it can be observed that although the progressive flooding process can take on a multitude of routes through many openings if it is simply cut off at its source the problem can be dealt with in a simple yet highly effective manner this is facilitated through forensic examination of all flooding scenarios to identify critical openings and flooding pathways deployable barriers comprise two lightweight shutters made of fire resistant flexible textile 30 cm thick normally a class fire rated fig 17 shutters only are deployed in case of fire casualties in case of flooding the cavity between shutters is filled with expanding foam delivered from a compressed foam canister the shutters are mechanically operated to be deployed vertically or horizontally to suit local structural details and arrangements the watertight integrity ascertained is typically rated up to 2 bars 20m water head the barrier can span distances up to any length with stiffening rods present within the textile and can be deployed within minutes to curtail and control previously identified critical floodwater pathways in this respect drawing on the results from forensic analysis through time domain flooding simulations an effective damage control plan could be set up and executed with the aid for example of a suitable decision support system linked to the ship safety management system this process can be guided in the most effective way thus providing the vessel damage response team with the ability to actively suppress floodwater propagation by isolating the damage area following any foreseeable critical flooding event this offers a distinct advantage over existing damage control plans which are limited by relying entirely on fixed design measures in order to contain the spread of floodwater as such they have limited flexibility and cannot effectively deal with all probable loss scenarios in addition there are several areas within any vessel in which watertight integrity must be sacrificed in order to allow for effective operation of the vessel i e lift trunks service corridors non watertight doors 7 large cruise ship application example this section focuses on the application of the methodology described in the foregoing on a very large cruise ship cs1 complete with the implementation and impact of flooding control using passive and active flooding protection designing and operating large cruise ships carries with it a great responsibility and as such demands a safety platform that goes beyond that which is currently required by regulations for this reason it was endeavoured to undertake a form of damage stability assessment that would subject the vessel to the most adverse scenarios statistics have to offer the intention here being that should any of these unlikely though plausible events ever occurred life on board will not be compromised furthermore and as has often been said you learn more from a failure than you do from success and this holds true when assessing vessel survivability that is to say the designer gains information of far greater utility through the identification of loss scenarios and mechanisms revealed therein than he does from a survival case for this reason it is of crucial importance that we identify or indeed actively seek out any and all failure modes we can within the design stage lest they be revealed to us at a later time and at a far greater cost after all when it is a question of safety it is only prudent to plan for the worst whilst working for the best and it is with this in mind that the present investigation has sought to adopt a systematic in depth approach to identify credible solutions to any realisable problem the assessment starts first by accounting for the current regulatory requirements and culminates in a vessel stress test the later has seen the vessel subjected to most extreme scenarios from all conceivable perspectives namely a design loading condition at limiting gm b maximum significant wave height 7 m from iacs global wave statistics and c maximum probable damage length with randomly defined damage location penetration and height cs1 survived all damages reflected in current regulations with considerable margins and failed only in 34 out of 1000 cases in the extreme scenarios outlined in the foregoing 9 progressive flooding and 25 transient losses this demonstrates an exceptional level of damage survivability by any measure and means but given the project in question it was thought appropriate to adopt a zero tolerance philosophy and to strive to achieve this in a feasible and economically viable way to this end passive and active solutions have been adopted to address specific loss modalities thus leaving only a few extreme transient losses where the limitation comes from physics and presently there is nothing we can do about it 7 1 input information 7 1 1 ship particulars the main particulars of the vessel are provided in the following table with approximate value provided for confidentiality purposes see table 2 7 1 2 simulation model arrangement and openings definition a detailed representation of the vessel internal geometry includes definition of all relevant spaces within the vessel weathertight envelop with the resultant model containing some 825 spaces see fig 18 as opposed to the static model which comprised just 367 spaces this is indicative of the reductive representation of the vessel one can expect to find in hydrostatic calculations the vessel opening definition leads to 1526 openings as shown within fig 19 7 2 numerical time domain simulations stress test 7 2 1 overview as was mentioned above the survivability assessment has been conducted in the spirit of assessing what could go wrong regardless of event probability in this respect a single sea state of 7 m wave height iacs global maximum is utilised in the simulations with an irregular wave environment in accordance with the jonswap spectrum the exposure time has been set at 30 min duration as in previous studies focus has been on collision damages alone as the vessel survives all probable bottom grounding scenarios whilst all side groundings are covered by the longer collision damages 7 2 1 1 damage generation based on the above a total of 1000 collision damages have been sampled for numerical simulations with a fixed damage length representing the maximum possible longitudinal breach based on solas damage statistics 60 m with all other damage characteristics having been sampled randomly the reason for this stems from the strong correlation between damage length and severity whereas other damage properties have a greater tendency to lead to more adverse outcomes at lesser extents in addition and deviating from general solas assumptions random values for the damage extent below the water line have been sampled from the distribution proposed in esafe bulian et al 2018 an illustration of the resultant damage sample is provided in fig 20 7 2 1 2 overview of simulation results the numerical simulation results have indicated that 34 cases will capsize within the given simulation time the cumulative distribution function for time to capsize ttc based on actual capsizes shows that the vessel achieves an equivalent survivability index of 96 6 see fig 21 by analysing the mode of loss across all loss scenarios 25 transient and 9 progressive flooding cases have been observed see fig 22 7 3 progressive flooding critical design features and solutions in alignment with the process outlined in the foregoing the simulation results pertaining to progressive flooding loss have been subjected to forensic analysis in order to identify and rank critical openings in accordance with this approach openings have been ranked in terms of frequency of involvement and floodwater mass transferred the results of this process are provided in fig 23 fig 24 and fig 25 7 4 implementation of flooding risk control options and results 7 4 1 transient flooding rcos passive protection abrupt nature of transient flooding renders active damage protection ineffective in this respect rcos must be built into the design offering instantly residual up righting moment in this respect due attention must be paid to causal and exacerbating design features including inadequate initial stability gm sources of asymmetry in subdivision ineffective subdivision high up in the ship insufficient reserve buoyancy and ineffective distribution of such the most effective rco is increasing gm but also the most difficult to achieve in this respect a few sources of asymmetric flooding were identified during the forensic analysis and eradicated e g connection between some port and starboard compartments introducing openings between some spaces and rendering some fire doors automatic in addition some void spaces in decks 2 and 3 were identified for installation of fixed foam arest p1 to provide additional reserve buoyancy including the installation of 4 partial bulkheads 7 4 2 progressive flooding rcos active protection a common form of active damage protection is counter ballasting but depending on the availability of relevant systems it can prove ineffective and untimely action phasing could render this counterproductive in addition the counterflooding process could give rise to slack tanks and subsequently introduce free surface effects which can compromise stability actuated systems are also available in the market e g macgregor actuated car deck doors but they are heavy expensive and inflexible in addition emergency response and crew action are some of the rcos being considered but the response is normally undirected and often unplanned leading to time wasting at best preparedness and readiness are also discussion topics but this comes with design and decision support ds integrated in the safety management system sms which are more esoteric than practical rcos with cs1 a close examination of the critical openings identified during the forensic analysis of the flooding process fig 14 and using the arteries vs veins analogy arest a2 system revealed that protecting 16 openings in the service corridor would eradicate all progressing flooding losses moreover accounting for functionality and ergonomics this led to considering only 6 deployable barriers spanning 6 8m to eradicate all progressive flooding losses 7 4 3 rcos implementation and impact passive and active flooding protection having identified and selected the aforementioned rcos and implemented these of the cruise ship cs1 all progressive flooding scenarios have been eradicated and only a handful of transient case still remain in which gravity wins and there is little that can be done about it the summary results are shown in table 3 below 8 concluding remarks deriving from the research presented in this paper the following remarks may be drawn scientific developments over the recent past afford forensic examination of the flooding process of a damaged ship leading to better understanding of the underlying mechanics and their evolution within the complex internal environment of modern cruise ships this feeds technological innovation for development of cost effective solutions to contain and control flooding risk in ships rendering ships virtually unsinkable this in turn raises societal expectations for maritime safety enhancement fuelling a virtuous circle that will close only if ships are designed built and operated with zero risk tolerance ultimately unsinkable ships credit

20714,damage stability is the achilles heel for all ship types responsible for 90 of the risk to human lives in maritime accidents of large passenger ships unsinkable ship is treated as a misnomer in the maritime industry after the titanic disaster which marred the idea for ever however titanic was designed using one damage scenario whilst designing modern megaships necessitates tens of thousands of scenarios and forensic detail of the whole flooding process within a detailed internal ship model environment combining this with recent technological innovations enables methodological treatment of damage stability supporting systematic identification and consideration of risk control options rcos to curtail and control flooding by passive active protection leading to ships that are unsinkable in all practical terms developments in the subject are critically reviewed leading to the realisation that naval architects have been trying to address damage stability by treating some key elements of the problem with naïve approximation leading to solving often the wrong problem moving forward the paper describes the renewed effort in the eu funded project flare clarkson 2019 to make amends and presents an application to a large cruise ship to demonstrate that using available knowledge and technology today designing unsinkable ships is within grasp keywords damage stability direct assessment methods active and passive protection flooding risk 1 introduction damage stability failure represents 90 of the risk to human lives in maritime accidents of large passenger ships affecting over 2 billion people who travel on these ships each year and around 100 000 commercial vessels operated by 1 5 million crew inadequate damage stability has been the cause of 53 of all vessel losses over the past decade and was the primary cause of 65 of losses in 2018 fig 1 more specifically in passenger ships the maximum number of passengers carried by the largest cruise ships each year has risen dramatically almost doubling to 6800 in 2019 compared to 1999 fig 2 this means that there is now a far greater risk of fatality for people onboard from any given single accident similarly there is about 1000 damage stability linked fatalities per year according to imo msc 72 16 14 february 2000 in the general shipping industry for ships over 550 gt and an astonishing 55 000 fatalities per year considering just two groups of smaller ship sizes fishing vessels 25 000 per year imoilofao 2010 domestic ferries 30 000 per year imo 2015 analysis of 230 000 marine insurance industry claims with a value of almost 10bn between july 2013 and july 2018 clarkson 2019 shows that ship sinking collision incidents are the most expensive cause of loss for insurers accounting for 16 of the value of all claims equivalent to more than 1 5bn over this period considering the above and with general consensus by industry experts solving the damage stability problem for ships is the holy grail in naval architecture with a huge transformational impact on the design and operation of every type and size of ship and the whole maritime industry however continued reliance on traditional flooding protection measures primarily watertight subdivision dictated by imo regulations is inhibiting progress due to saturation of this form of protection in simpler words such flooding protection has a physical limit which if exceeded reaches a safety plateau that is now being felt across the industry additionally watertight subdivision consumes deck and hull space adds weight and negatively affects ergonomics all of which work to reduce vessel earning potential this place business objectives in conflict with safety objectives and consequently demands for improved safety standards are often met with resistance from industry thus inhibiting progress furthermore difficulty of application in retrospect means that there is an ever growing safety gap between existing and newbuild vessels leaving most vessels operating at inferior safety standards as such to continue improving vessel safety in a meaningful way there is pressing need to explore alternative solutions to this problem 2 background the specific background pertinent to this paper will be addressed in this section in the form of elaborating on specific related facts following which the way forward is delineated 2 1 life cycle flooding risk management the realisation that risk is inextricably linked to operation and a derivative of exposure has driven the maritime industry to life cycle considerations for effective flooding risk management key to life cycle flooding risk management is the understanding that both the operational phase monitoring and management of residual risk as well as emergencies emergency response depend crucially on having identified during the design phase pertinent design vulnerabilities that lead to critical accident scenarios in pre specified loading and environmental conditions and on the basis of this having taken appropriate measures to ensure damage protection and control to adopted tolerable levels helping in this direction is contemporary understanding of the forensic detail of design vulnerabilities for damage stability and of the ensuing behaviour of ships in extreme damage conditions pertinent to the ships being built and operated today in addition offering the industry a cost effective means for flooding risk reduction and control will incentivise adoption of higher safety standards thus providing a mechanism to fuel continuous improvement what is missing is institutionalisation of these tools methods and processes in the maritime industry and this is one of the objectives in project flare flare 2019 2022 2 2 old ships vs new ships the shipping industry is very old and consequentially very traditional damage protection in the form of watertight bulkheads was the first risk control option proposed in 1854 but it has taken many more accidents and significant loss of life including the titanic for it to be internationally adopted as solas 1929 it is more than likely that the delay was primarily because the industry was keenly aware that serving safety will compromise functionality and earnings ultimately viability of business and this contrast and conflict continues to this day this is clearly obvious in that new regulations for damage stability apply only to newbuildings grandfather clause hence assuming a 5 constant growth of the industry over the years this leaves the majority of ships existing ships with an inferior damage stability standard and damage protection a gap that widens progressively to the extent that solas becomes less and less relevant the only way that this landslide will be arrested is if cost effective active damage control measures were made available thus incentivising the industry to adopt these for life cycle damage stability flooding risk management as elaborated in the following paragraph 2 3 passive vs active protection in the quest for damage stability improvement design passive protection has traditionally been the only means to achieve this in a measurable auditable way solas 2009 ch ii 1 however it is undeniable that the consequences from inadequate damage stability can also be reduced by operational active measures which may be very effective in reducing loss of life the residual risk as a matter of fact active and passive measures for damage control have co existed almost from the outset one could imagine that in the absence of decks old seamen would have had to use buckets later on pumps and other means to empty floodwater from ship hulls plug holes with any matter of means adjust sails and so on more latterly safety equipment lsa drill teams safety centres safety masters and other active damage protection measures have been progressively introduced most in the wake of accidents so why this myopic and uncompromising focus only on passive protection there are two reasons for this the first relates to the traditional understanding that operational measures safeguard against erosion of the design safety envelop increase of residual risk over time the second derives from lack of measurement and verification of the risk reduction potential by any active measures notwithstanding this the exact contribution of active measures to safety has never been considered even as a discussion topic irrespective of how effective these might be as damage protection control options the dogma that if it cannot be measured it cannot be improved has gone a step further in the maritime industry to become if it cannot be measured it cannot be regulated hence all these options however cost effective and safety effective might be they are not being considered as a means of damage protection in the same way that passive measures are for example for passive protection we have indices of subdivision indices for damages indices for survival indices for everything there is some refreshing new ground on passenger evacuation metrics but this is still highly general some say arbitrary and incomplete novel technology qualification risk assessing and de risking the novelty offers a portal for introducing active means of damage protection and modern tools offer enhanced capability to estimate flooding risk over the life cycle even live risk on board ships this is the requisite platform to facilitate change and as stated in the foregoing project flare will facilitate a systematic and structured way to account for such developments this in turn will change the maritime safety agenda and its evolution in simple terms what is needed is the means to account for risk reduction by operational interventional means as well as measures that may be taken during emergencies such risk reduction may then be considered alongside risk reduction deriving from design measures therefore new measures for risk reduction operational and in emergencies should be considered in addition to design measures what needs to be demonstrated and justified is the level of risk reduction and a way to account for it the latter by adopting a formal process and taking requisite steps to institutionalise it 2 4 prevention vs mitigation one ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure this is almost a dogma in most fields of safety science and engineering there are however two aspects worth considering from a different perspective the first is residual risk which for large passenger ships is so excessive that reducing this must be priority for example consider the ship being investigated later on in his paper which is a 10 500 people on board pob ship in the imo fsa for cruise ships it has been proposed that risk control options for ship safety enhancement will be costed against the propensity of society to spend towards saving one life which for the western world is 8m with the a index of this ship being approximately 0 9 using imo solas 2009 and if collision had taken place the residual risk is worth with collision probability assumed as 1 0 1 x10 500 x 8m 8 4b a few times over the worth of the ship the second relates to the feasibility of preventive vs mitigating measures for effective preventive measures we should be searching far into the left of the fault tree see bow tie in fig 3 where the emphasis lies on sociotechnical organisational and safety culture matters which will require long term investment and effort to identify and bring to fruition effective rcos mitigation measures on the other hand are linked strongly to technological innovation where the strength currently lies hence solutions are likely to be of shorter term and more than likely cost effective therefore mitigation remains a key target in this respect the prevailing situation can be drastically improved through understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to vessel loss and to identification of governing design and operational parameters to target flooding risk reduction cost effectively this in turn necessitates the development and institutionalisation of appropriate methods tools and techniques capable of meaningfully addressing the physical phenomena involved another target of the eu project flare flare 2019 2022 2 5 the way forward the first key word is lifecycle the realisation that risk is inextricably linked to operation and a derivative of exposure has driven the industry to life cycle considerations for effective flooding risk management key to this is the understanding that both the operational phase monitoring and management of residual risk as well as emergencies emergency response depend crucially on having identified during the design phase pertinent design vulnerabilities which lead to critical flooding scenarios in pre specified loading and environmental conditions and on the basis of this having taken appropriate measures to ensure damage protection and control to satisfy adopted tolerability levels such measures are normally referred to as recovery control measures or mitigating and controlling measures barriers is another term fig 3 which as indicated and explained in the foregoing traditionally have focussed on passive measures of damage protection in the aftermath of the flooding accident however safety affects everything on the life cycle of a ship and is in turn affected by everything so why focusing singularly on design passive protection and ignoring any interventional active measures during normal operation and in emergencies utilising the imo probabilistic damage stability framework the provisions for alternative design and arrangements ad a imo 2006 and goal based standards and safety level approach a life cycle flooding risk based regulatory framework will enable and support a continuous evolution of regulations ensuring the risk level is alarp as low as reasonably practicable whilst providing a sound platform for benchmarking alternative novel ship and system designs and operating procedures for new and existing ships to this end a fundamental requisite is that pertinent risks need to be quantified in many cases almost in real time throughout the life cycle of the ship from design and daily operation to crisis situations consequentially there is clear need for wider consideration of measures of flooding risk mitigation and control namely active as well as passive measures of flooding protection in a way that every measure is assigned a risk metric and is accounted for in such risk assessment this is also being taken care in project flare flare 2019 2022 2 6 the way forward the second key word is holistic one of the most significant gaps in addressing flooding risk derives from the fact that emphasis on prevention has over the years been only cursory with strong emphasis on damage limitation post accident therefore the scope need not only be life cycle addressing active and passive means of damage mitigation and control but also holistic addressing both prevention and mitigation control measures through an all embracing risk based regulatory framework for damage stability flooding risk the way this is included in project flare is through the development of a risk aware susceptibility models to flooding incidents accounting for all pertinent hazards topology bathymetry traffic weather conditions and ship types leading to probabilistic estimates of flooding risk by direct assessment on this basis a typical formulation of the flooding risk will be in the form shown in eq 1 vassalos 2004 1 rf pf x pb f x psc b x ploss sc namely flooding risk probability that a flooding event has occurred x probability of hull breach conditional on the flooding event x probability of sinking capsize conditional on hull breach x probability of human life loss conditional on ship sinking capsizing the current imo probabilistic rules for damage stability addresses only part of the 2nd term namely probability of hull breach conditional on a collision event p factor and part of the 3rd term namely the compliment of the probability of capsize sinking as a result of collision only a index in solas ch ii 2 therefore flooding events as a result of side and bottom groundings are not considered and neither is the probability of having a flooding event adopting such a framework will bring together every aspect of risk prevention mitigation and control targeting a balance of all credible rcos and leading to the most cost effective means of flooding risk management 3 ec funded project flare to address the gaps and emerging needs a large consortium comprising some 20 organisations from industry academia and ros set up the research project flare flare 2019 2022 with significant funding from the eu targeting the following specific objectives the flare overriding objective is to develop a novel risk based methodology beyond the existing state of the art for live flooding risk assessment and containment in line with imo high level goals specific objectives include to collate and analyse all pertinent accident data to create a flooding incident accident database for relevant type of ships and damages use this database with support from flooding simulation tools and expert judgement to develop a generic risk model for flooding incidents accounting for collision and grounding ensure the risk model is holistic all flooding accident types all modes of loss active and passive measures hence with application potential to both newbuildings and existing ships facilitate real time flooding risk evaluation for risk monitoring and effective control in emergencies consider an all embracing risk aware approach post flooding incidents by addressing the whole spectrum of risk from susceptibility to flooding to emergency response including mustering and abandonment in pertinent flooding scenarios provide the technical basis and a proposal for the revision of relevant imo regulations towards a risk based approach to contain and control flooding incidents on this basis and accounting for state of the art table 1 summarises and contrasts current practice with flare targets and highlights the expected novelty in the flare output 4 adopted methodology for flooding risk estimation the methodology adopted has been tailored to cater for the design and implementation of pertinent risk control options preventive and mitigating and is comprised of eight distinct phases as elaborated in the following and shown in fig 4 4 1 stage 1 static dynamic stability assessments the process begins by addressing two forms of damage stability assessment in parallel one based upon conventional hydrostatic techniques and the other using advanced numerical time domain flooding simulations herein distinguished as static and dynamic approaches respectively the static component is conducted in accordance with applicable imo statutory instruments which vary depending on vessel age type and size when assessing new build vessels engaged in international voyage this relates to the requirements of either solas 2009 or solas 2020 as applicable both these forms of assessment offer a distinct advantage over deterministic instruments in that they are for the most part performance based in nature this enables a quantifiable baseline risk level to be established from which the impact of rcos can later be measured and compared unfortunately a great deal of existing ships and domestic vessels are regulated based on older prescriptive regimes with an implicit but not explicitly quantifiable safety level a secondary and complimentary assessment is also conducted at this stage utilising numerical time domain simulations as a means of addressing vessel survivability this form of assessment as in the case of solas 2009 20 is also performance based and thus well suited for evaluation of various rcos however the way vessel performance is measured differs greatly between the two approaches numerical simulations draw upon first principles and have a greater capacity to capture the underlying physics of the flooding process this means they do not suffer to the same extent from elements of assumption generalisation and simplification that are commonplace within technical standards consequently the results from numerical simulations work to not only support and verify the results of the static assessment but also offer a wealth of additional information and insight into important flooding processes and components of survivability that simply cannot be captured using statics 4 2 stages 2 4 static dynamic vulnerability assessments the second stage of the process comprises vulnerability assessments that are conducted based on the two sets of results generated in the previous stage in both cases there are three primary aims to this process namely to establish the degree of vulnerability present the nature of said vulnerability and its sources gaining such understanding is crucial in deriving rcos as any effective treatment must be founded upon accurate diagnosis both statics and dynamics offer metrics by which to gauge the degree of vulnerability those being the attained subdivision index and the survivability index the latter simply refers to the ratio of cases survived to the total number of cases considered in dynamic damage stability assessments respectively delving deeper within stage 3 the nature of the vulnerability is identified by assessing failure modes this can be achieved either through consideration of the dominant criteria in statics or by forensic investigation of the flooding sequence in dynamic assessment undertaking such analysis allows loss scenarios to be categorised as those cases in which unprotected openings or progressive flooding are responsible for loss or instead where a lack of stability or transient flooding give rise to loss it is highly important to make this distinction as both loss modalities call for very different treatments and once categorised in his manner both openings and regions within the vessel can be ranked according to their criticality here loss scenarios are defined as cases in which the survival factor is less than one or in which the vessel capsizes 4 3 stages 5 solution development this stage of the process involves targeted application of rcos here depending on the mode of loss the arest p1 and a1 solutions are utilised in the treatment of cases suffering from stability and transient flooding issues whilst the arest a2 system is employed to curtail progressive flooding see later in the paper 4 4 stages 6 7 re evaluation of static and dynamic damage stability having implemented rcos the vessel damage stability performance is re evaluated and an iterative process ensues here the residual risk is assessed in accordance with stages 2 4 in order to determine if stability safety objectives have been met failing this the updated results can be called upon in order to determine areas that may benefit from additional protection 4 5 stage 8 novel technology qualification classification the final stage in the methodology is to undergo a novel technology qualification ntq process which is the route offered by most classification societies towards the approval of new and innovative technologies this is important as currently established codes and procedures tend to be empirical by nature and thus solutions without prior precedent are ill covered if at all the overriding objective behind this process is to ensure that any rco proposed is fit for purpose and this relates to not only safety but also performance functionality and availability in addition this stage acts to test the practicality of the solution which is a highly important consideration as one does not wish to solve one problem by introducing another furthermore what could look very attractive on the page can often fail to stand up to practical scrutiny and for any research in this direction to have true value it must be applicable in practice 5 ship damage stability and survivability assessment process this section serves to provide a critical overview of the survivability assessment process as developed at the university of strathclyde over the past few decades 5 1 limitations in hydrostatics for damage stability and the need for numerical simulations flooding simulations allow for a more refined assessment of vessel damage survivability in comparison with the conventional hydrostatic calculation techniques found in the current imo regulatory instruments solas 2009 2020 this is particularly true in the case of large passenger vessels where the ability of hydrostatics to accurately assess and quantify ship survivability remains a highly contentious point vassalos addresses this specific issue in detail vassalos 2016 here he calls attention to several areas in which the current static based regulatory scheme fails to cater for cruise vessels in an appropriate manner put plainly there is a clear and observable difference between cruise vessels and ropax vessels which needs to be accounted for by some means the introduction of solas 2020 made some progress in this direction by introducing a more stringent s factor for ropax vessels in case of damage to the ro ro spaces however this alone represents the sole distinguishing element between these two ship types and is one that serves only to differentiate ropax vessels from cruise vessels and not the other way round such differentiation acts only to cater for flooding mechanisms relating specifically to ropax ships and there are no such provisions designed to cater for cruise vessels and their own specific flooding mechanisms as such some effort is required in order to bring the regulations back into harmony with reality or else other tools need be sought in order to fill this gap moreover there are also several limitations inherent in the static assessment process itself as opposed to any regulatory shortcomings or mistreatments these relate primarily to the inability of hydrostatics to accurately account for and capture different loss modalities this is highly important not only in determining risk but also in identifying appropriate rcos traditionally the attained subdivision index a index has been used in order to gauge the effectiveness of rcos either by measuring improvement in the a index itself or as an input to quantitative risk assessment qra this allows the reduction in the expected value or rate of death to be determined δpll from which rco cost effectiveness can be gauged this process allows for a relatively fair and time efficient means of ranking rcos but fails to account for the whole picture one of the fundamental philosophies behind the probabilistic approach to damage stability assessment is that two vessels with the same attained subdivision index are considered equally safe imo 2017 this is however not necessarily the case as the element of time is removed from the question if two vessels were considered each having an index of 0 8 there is no indication of the severity of the twenty percent of cases in which each vessel is lost one vessel could be prone to transient capsize and the other to progressive flooding loss in which case the casualty rate would vary dramatically and so too the risk level some effort was made to account for this in the collision risk model developed in goalds goalds 2009 2012 and more recently the emsa iii project emsa 2013 2015 here the risk model accounted for fast and slow flooding probabilities within the collision event tree but this determination was made independently of the attained subdivision index and therefore was not based on the actual behaviour of the damaged vessel furthermore there is some ambiguity surrounding what constitutes fast flooding in comparison to slow leading to the question how fast is fast and inversely how slow is slow notwithstanding the above static assessment techniques even though unable to directly distinguish between loss modalities do provide some indication firstly in order to account for transient asymmetric flooding the current regulations apply an intermediate s factor in cases where flooding is not considered instantaneous within 60 s here a quasi static approach is adopted whereby the flooding process is broken down into various stages and phases providing snapshots of the flooding process but not the full time dependent flooding progression this in turn can be used to determine if the vessel possesses a higher risk of capsize within intermediate stages of flooding thus allowing cases that could be prone to transient capsize to be identified however this quasi static treatment of intermediate flooding has long fallen into question due to the highly violent and dynamic nature of the initial flooding stages dafermos and papanikolaou 2016 in the consideration of the potential for progressive flooding the regulations work by truncating the vessel damaged gz curve at the point of immersion of unprotected openings or by considering the vessel as lost if such openings or weather tight openings were immersed at equilibrium this in turn allows cases prone to progressive flooding to be identified if limited in this way and the underlying logic here is clear as to the prevention of progressive flooding where the limitations of this approach appear is in the fact that by truncating the gz curve in this way the focus is on a small portion of the flooding chain not allowing the entire floodwater evolution to unfold knowledge of what may have happened or the consequences is lost important questions relating to the actual extent of flooding that would be realised the openings through which this would occur and the time that this would take are all left unanswered this limited scope through which the flooding process is viewed also has potential repercussions as regards the implementation of rcos for example if the focus is on the initially immersed opening in the flooding sequence and if this opening for operational reasons could not be protected the designer may reside to the fact that this is an unavoidable risk however there is every possibility that if the flooding chain could not be broken here it may very well be broken a little further within the flooding evolution and this information is all lost within the current regulatory scheme to summarise static assessment techniques provide a somewhat opaque and limited view of flooding risk and its sources consequently it is important that where possible and appropriate we support these calculations with other tools for this reason numerical time domain simulations tools are indispensable in assessing vessel survivability in the case of cruise vessels where the greatest uncertainty lies this is in line with evolving trends within the industry where given the potential severity of a major accident involving a large passenger vessel simply ensuring compliance is no longer considered sufficient king and v 2016 instead there has been a turn towards the use of first principles tools coupled with a more proactive approach that promotes continuous safety improvement over simply ensuring compliance 5 2 background on the development of simulation tools since their inception in the mid 1980s time domain flooding simulations have been used in order to gain a better understanding of complex flooding processes that cannot be captured accurately using static assessment techniques early forms of such tools were used predominantly to assess the damage survivability of ropax vessels with a focus on cross flooding and the accumulation of water on the ro ro deck such research was fuelled by a number of major accidents that occurred around this time including the loss of herald of free enterprise in 1987 and the sinking of estonia in 1994 both of which acted as catalysts for development in the understanding that something had to change one of the earliest examples of such work was the investigation conducted by spouge when assessing the sinking of the ro ro ferry european gateway spouge 1986 here he employed a quasi static simulation approach with flooding rates determined by a simple hydraulic model leading to one of the earliest reports on the effects of transient asymmetric flooding unfortunately however it became clear that the abrupt and highly dynamic nature of transient flooding could not be captured accurately using quasi statics leading to the development of an improved model in vredeveldt and journee 1991 in contrast their approach relied on a hybrid simulation model whereby roll motion was captured using dynamics whilst other less critical degrees of freedom dof were dealt with in a quasi static manner journee vermeer vredeveldt then later expanded this to account for dynamic motion in all six degrees of freedom journee et al 1997 in parallel with such developments vassalos turan turan and vassalos 1994 developed a 3dof dynamic flooding model capable of accounting for the effects of irregular seas as opposed to the calm water assumption made by the majority of other models at the time this was an important development given that 70 of accidents occur in waves and just a year later this model was further expanded in order to account for all 6dof by vassalos letizia vassalos and letizia 1995 in the years that followed such tools were further advanced and refined with papanikolaou papanikolaou et al 2000 applying the lumped mass concept in order to better account for internal floodwater dynamics and sloshing effects a concept which was further developed by jasionowski and vassalos 2001 not long after these developments the first application of numerical simulations to cruise vessels were conducted perhaps most notably recorded in vassalos and letizia 1995 and papanikolaou et al 2000 the works by vassalos vassalos et al 2004 and van t veer van t veer and d 2004 in both cases simulations were conducted on large cruise vessels accounting for motion in all six dof the breach sizes examined were in line with that used in the harder model tests namely a two compartment damage scenario about amidships of 0 033 lpp in length b 5 in penetration and spanning from above the tank top to one deck above the vessel bulkhead deck in both instances the vessel internal geometry was modelled in detail both in terms of compartmentation and in terms of openings interestingly despite the similarities between these assessments two very different sets of conclusions were drawn on the one hand van t veer concluded that cruise vessels were predominantly prone to loss of residual stability through progressive flooding rather than transient capsize in contrast vassalos alerted to the fact that cruise vessels were indeed vulnerable to transient capsize citing the multiple free surface effects that are formed in the early stages of flooding as the casual factor this should have been particularly alarming given the modest damage size and penetration examined but instead the conclusions drawn by van t veer became more widely accepted fostering the notion that cruise vessels are vulnerable only to progressive flooding consequently the question of transient flooding as regards cruise vessels had been left to sleep for many years until awoken recently in such research projects as esafe esafe 2017 2019 and flare flare 2019 2022 where the seriousness of the situation with transient flooding being left to hibernate for all these years has drastically undermined progress in damage survivability of passenger ships 5 3 survivability assessment process flare flare 2019 2022 5 3 1 preparation of the simulation model flooding simulations allow for a far greater level of detail within the vessel internal geometry to be captured in comparison to hydrostatic models here all features liable to inhibit or facilitate the flooding process are modelled with consideration of the vessel entire weathertight envelope usually spanning two or three decks above the bulkhead deck this includes the consideration of spaces such as cold rooms lift trunks ventilation trunks escape trunks stairwells a class fire rated structure and watertight divisions the result is something far more representative of the actual vessel geometry in comparison to static models which for a medium sized cruise vessel would comprise some 700 spaces as opposed to the 250 spaces one would expect to find within the static equivalent the ability to capture geometric details in this way is of particular importance concerning cruise vessels as the simplifications made within statics often lead to a very reductive representation of the vessel internal arrangement this contrasts with ropax vessels where the internal geometry is rather simple to begin with and so the level of detail lost is significantly less fig 5 below provides a comparison between the static and simulation models of a medium size cruise vessel in addition to modelling internal spaces in far greater detail simulation models also account for internal openings in a manner far more reflective of reality in general all openings linking the modelled rooms are accounted for and represented by their physical geometries doors are also assigned leakage and collapse properties in accordance with the findings of the eu project floodstand floodstand 2009 2012 here full scale tests coupled with fea analysis were conducted on several typical passenger vessel door types in order to determine their resistance to floodwater each opening is also assigned a uniform discharge coefficient of c d 0 6 which represents the industry standard for this property this coefficient represents the ratio between the actual discharge and the theoretical discharge ideal flow through a constricted opening at the time of flooding all doors are assumed to have a closed status such as to assess vessel survivability in its best state which provides a fair baseline level from which to gauge the benefits of additional rcos otherwise improvements would pertain to vessel operational risk according to its existing design i e recommending certain existing doors be closed in case of damage having followed this process the simulation model of a medium to large cruise vessel would generally contain around 1000 1500 openings as shown in fig 6 5 3 2 damage scenario definition damage scenarios have been defined by applying monte carlo sampling techniques to pertinent damage and sea state probability distributions producing damage breaches characterised by size location and environmental conditions the sample size considered varies across the assessments conducted but no less than 1500 cases have been considered for any given damage type firstly collision damages have been defined according to the distributions generated within the eu project harder harder 1999 2003 which form the basis of the current s factor applicable to all passenger ships in such cases the existing distributions have been further expanded in order to account for variation in the lower extent of damage based on the work outlined in bulian et al 2019 where other damage types have been considered namely side and bottom grounding the distributions developed within the extensive work conducted in golads papanikolaou et al 2013 and later emsa iii emsa 2013 2015 have been considered an example of collision breach sample is provided in fig 7 5 3 3 sample size in generating breaches from statistical damage distributions when generating scenarios by sampling probability distributions it is important to ensure that the sample is a fair and accurate representation of the underlying distributions the magnitude of the error incurred here is predominantly a function of the sample size and as such it is of great importance to ensure that a statistically valid sample is considered however as the sample size increases so too does the calculation time and computational cost so one must seek to strike a balance between these two competing objectives in order to make this determination the standard error of the mean has been used to ascertain sample quality and is a measure of the accuracy in which the sample mean x reflects the actual distribution mean μ calculated in accordance with equation 2 by assessing the magnitude of the standard error as a function of sample size the relationship between these two parameters can be derived normally there are diminishing returns in error reduction for sample sizes greater than 750 samples similar tendencies were identified when assessing other parameters in this way with a variation 50 samples found across all cases this indicated an optimal sample size of 700 800 samples the reason a greater sample quantity has been considered stems from the nature of the sampling process itself which provides a subset of all probable cases with proportional representation of various extents but fails to capture all possible scenarios this is part icularly true in the case of low probability events which are often poorly represented within small samples 2 s e σ n where σ sample standard deviation n number of samples in addition to considering the standard error confidence intervals have also been derived for each sample in order to illustrate the range of confidence across the sample cdf for this purpose the dvoretzky kiefer wolfowitz inequality has been utilised dvoretzky et al 1956 which allows different rates in violation to be identified across the range of the distribution equations eq 3 and eq 4 an example of how this error varies relative to sample size is also provided in fig 8 3 f n x ε f x f n x ε 4 ε l n 2 α 2 n where f x the true sample cdf f n x lower and upper bounds 1 α level of confidence i e α 0 05 for 95 confidence 5 3 4 survivability estimation the results of the flooding simulations allow the vessel survivability index to be determined which represents the ratio of cases survived to cases lost this is a time conditional value often depicted as the cumulative distribution function of time to capsize ttc shown in fig 9 here the probability of vessel capsize can be observed over time the complement of which represents the vessel probability of survival 5 3 5 forensic analysis of vessel vulnerability 5 3 5 1 determining loss modality having conducted the vessel survivability assessment described in the foregoing there will be a subset of the initial scenario sample identified as capsize cases these scenarios are then subjected to a process of detailed forensic investigation which starts at the highest level with the determination of the modality of loss this is achieved through consideration of the ttc and roll time history relating to each scenario which illustrates clearly if the vessel is lost as a result of transient effects or flooding progression over a greater period time see figs 10 and 11 this is an important first step not only in identifying the root cause of ship vulnerability but also in the development of appropriate rcos the determination of whether the vessel is lost because of transient capsize or progressive flooding has a large impact on the nature of rco that should be employed firstly there is the element of time which in the case of transient capsize would not allow a system requiring actuation to be used thus changing the focus to built in stability solutions alternatively if progressive flooding were the underlying cause of loss then the designer would best focus on the openings that facilitate such flooding as described in the following 5 3 5 2 identification of critical openings the second stage in the forensic investigation relates to the consideration of progressive flooding loss scenarios and the openings through which this flooding occurs the nature and severity of progressive flooding is dependent on the internal geometry of the vessel which is a complex environment and one in which attention to detail is of great importance at the highest level the susceptibility of a given vessel to progressive flooding can be viewed as a function of the following characteristics of its internal geometry ability to inhibit flooding progression wt door swt doors a class fire doors ability to distribute floodwater favourably i e cross flooding up flooding down flooding predominance of features that facilitate progressive flooding lift trunks vents service corridors undivided spaces given the above vulnerabilities in such cases tend to stem from local as opposed to global design features which calls for a detailed assessment of all such features the results yielded from the numerical simulations provide a lot of information on the flooding process however the difficulty comes when managing and processing this information in order to identify vulnerabilities and subsequently effective rcos one of the first ways in which this problem has been approached concerns the evaluation of case specific floodwater evolutions and the sequence of opening immersion as illustrated in fig 12 in this example the time history of floodwater mass has been superimposed with the openings that are immersed throughout the flooding progression by observing each case in this way critical openings can be identified where spikes in floodwater mass occur following their immersion in addition by assessing the flooding chain in this manner one can endeavour to break the chain at the earliest feasible stage it should be noted however that a certain degree of care needs to be taken in interpreting this information as there are both positive and negative forms of progressive flooding meaning this information cannot be viewed in isolation as such the roll response time history is often viewed in the same manner in order to determine if the immersed openings are acting to disperse floodwater favourably i e cross flooding equalisation or are they generating further asymmetry alternatively the sequence of space involvement can be called upon firstly as a means of ascertaining which spaces are involved within the flooding evolution and secondly as an indicator of positive or negative progressive flooding occurrence see fig 13 building on the above a more general approach has been developed in order to allow for a timely means of ranking openings based on their criticality this involves a three stage approach each of which focuses on a different measure of opening criticality in order to ensure all pertinent vulnerability metrics are accounted for including stage 1 frequency of occurrence in this stage all progressive flooding cases that have led to capsize are analysed in order to identify those openings that facilitate flooding progression in each case the openings identified are assessed with regards to their frequency of occurrence thus allowing their vulnerability to be ranked in this respect stage 2 net floodwater mass transfer in recognition of the fact that those openings identified in stage 1 as vulnerable may be of high frequency but low consequence a second and complimentary assessment is conducted in which the net mass of floodwater transferred through each opening is evaluated this provides a secondary measure of criticality by focusing on severity as opposed to probability of involvement stage 3 high floodwater mass transfer frequency the third and final assessment is a hybrid of the two previously outlined stages here those openings that possess both high floodwater mass transfer and frequency of involvement are considered allowing openings to be ranked based on both probability and criticality the results of this process produce a ranking of opening criticality as shown in the example of fig 14 6 adaptive reconfigurable safety technology arest systems flare flare 2019 2022 the analysis of vessel flooding vulnerability at forensic level combined with recent technological developments deriving from five years of research and application at strathclyde on the use of high expansion foam as a means of restoring lost buoyancy following accidental flooding events deriving from collision of grounding accidents enabled a systematic consideration of all loss modalities in a damaged ship and the development of systems leading to restoration of loss buoyancy under the trade name of arest systems the main options include either the deployment of high expansion foam in selected vulnerable spaces as a means of passive active protection or deployable barriers to curtail and control the process of flooding both options have been tested through several feasibility studies with industry involving new designs and existing ships and are currently undergoing approvals with class and administration the latter is ship type and ship design specific but the process is generic strathclyde university holds patents for these concepts which were developed over a 3 year scottish government funded project whilst the offering involves partnerships with the multi national foam manufacturer minova and the australian design office sea transport solutions being able to offer cost effective solutions to the damage stability problem for ships will lead to a transformational change in ship design and operation with immeasurable impact on the whole maritime industry moreover the same concept being used to address design of newbuildings will enable attention to all existing ships which are currently operating at inferior stability standards a hiccup in maritime legislation known as grandfather clause as elaborated earlier in the paper 6 1 the concept safety is normally a compromise to vessel earning potential and as public demand for higher safety standards grows industry is forced to choose between viability of business and safety of customers to address this conflict for flooding risk the in operation optimal internal arrangement of the vessel is adapted and reconfigured using passive fixed void filling foam and active deployable foam bulkheads containment systems this leads to containing the amount of floodwater entering the ship hull and spreading through the ship post flooding accidents the innovation is a simple yet highly effective flooding protection system applicable to all ship types in particular safety critical ships 6 2 arest systems adaptive reconfigurable safety technology arest systems relates to a university of strathclyde patent patent no pct gb 2017 050681 pertaining to a series of active and passive systems comprising the use of high expansion foam to restrict and contain the floodwater

installation permanent void filling to enhance residual stability fig 15 this is a passive flooding protection system pertaining to the installation of permanent foam in void spaces to provide additional reserve buoyancy when these spaces are damaged following a flooding incident thus increasing damage gm such installations act much like buoyancy tanks with impermeable volume to provide buoyancy when damaged within the immediate damaged area upon installation the foam adheres to the vessel steel structure and acts as a protective anti corrosive coating prohibiting build up of moisture between foam and ship structure and offering effective insulation the foam is resilient and will last without degradation for the vessel life span 6 2 2 arest a2 a2f deployable watertight bulkheads for flooding fire protection fig 16 during the flooding process of a complex internal environment the internal geometry of a ship and the progressive flooding paths therein can be likened to the cardiovascular system of the human anatomy in this respect there exist minor progressive flooding paths that act much like veins and major progressive floodwater paths that act like arteries in order to most effectively deal with progressive flooding in ships it is best to focus on blocking these arteries in this schematic representation of a complex internal ship environment it can be observed that although the progressive flooding process can take on a multitude of routes through many openings if it is simply cut off at its source the problem can be dealt with in a simple yet highly effective manner this is facilitated through forensic examination of all flooding scenarios to identify critical openings and flooding pathways deployable barriers comprise two lightweight shutters made of fire resistant flexible textile 30 cm thick normally a class fire rated fig 17 shutters only are deployed in case of fire casualties in case of flooding the cavity between shutters is filled with expanding foam delivered from a compressed foam canister the shutters are mechanically operated to be deployed vertically or horizontally to suit local structural details and arrangements the watertight integrity ascertained is typically rated up to 2 bars 20m water head the barrier can span distances up to any length with stiffening rods present within the textile and can be deployed within minutes to curtail and control previously identified critical floodwater pathways in this respect drawing on the results from forensic analysis through time domain flooding simulations an effective damage control plan could be set up and executed with the aid for example of a suitable decision support system linked to the ship safety management system this process can be guided in the most effective way thus providing the vessel damage response team with the ability to actively suppress floodwater propagation by isolating the damage area following any foreseeable critical flooding event this offers a distinct advantage over existing damage control plans which are limited by relying entirely on fixed design measures in order to contain the spread of floodwater as such they have limited flexibility and cannot effectively deal with all probable loss scenarios in addition there are several areas within any vessel in which watertight integrity must be sacrificed in order to allow for effective operation of the vessel i e lift trunks service corridors non watertight doors 7 large cruise ship application example this section focuses on the application of the methodology described in the foregoing on a very large cruise ship cs1 complete with the implementation and impact of flooding control using passive and active flooding protection designing and operating large cruise ships carries with it a great responsibility and as such demands a safety platform that goes beyond that which is currently required by regulations for this reason it was endeavoured to undertake a form of damage stability assessment that would subject the vessel to the most adverse scenarios statistics have to offer the intention here being that should any of these unlikely though plausible events ever occurred life on board will not be compromised furthermore and as has often been said you learn more from a failure than you do from success and this holds true when assessing vessel survivability that is to say the designer gains information of far greater utility through the identification of loss scenarios and mechanisms revealed therein than he does from a survival case for this reason it is of crucial importance that we identify or indeed actively seek out any and all failure modes we can within the design stage lest they be revealed to us at a later time and at a far greater cost after all when it is a question of safety it is only prudent to plan for the worst whilst working for the best and it is with this in mind that the present investigation has sought to adopt a systematic in depth approach to identify credible solutions to any realisable problem the assessment starts first by accounting for the current regulatory requirements and culminates in a vessel stress test the later has seen the vessel subjected to most extreme scenarios from all conceivable perspectives namely a design loading condition at limiting gm b maximum significant wave height 7 m from iacs global wave statistics and c maximum probable damage length with randomly defined damage location penetration and height cs1 survived all damages reflected in current regulations with considerable margins and failed only in 34 out of 1000 cases in the extreme scenarios outlined in the foregoing 9 progressive flooding and 25 transient losses this demonstrates an exceptional level of damage survivability by any measure and means but given the project in question it was thought appropriate to adopt a zero tolerance philosophy and to strive to achieve this in a feasible and economically viable way to this end passive and active solutions have been adopted to address specific loss modalities thus leaving only a few extreme transient losses where the limitation comes from physics and presently there is nothing we can do about it 7 1 input information 7 1 1 ship particulars the main particulars of the vessel are provided in the following table with approximate value provided for confidentiality purposes see table 2 7 1 2 simulation model arrangement and openings definition a detailed representation of the vessel internal geometry includes definition of all relevant spaces within the vessel weathertight envelop with the resultant model containing some 825 spaces see fig 18 as opposed to the static model which comprised just 367 spaces this is indicative of the reductive representation of the vessel one can expect to find in hydrostatic calculations the vessel opening definition leads to 1526 openings as shown within fig 19 7 2 numerical time domain simulations stress test 7 2 1 overview as was mentioned above the survivability assessment has been conducted in the spirit of assessing what could go wrong regardless of event probability in this respect a single sea state of 7 m wave height iacs global maximum is utilised in the simulations with an irregular wave environment in accordance with the jonswap spectrum the exposure time has been set at 30 min duration as in previous studies focus has been on collision damages alone as the vessel survives all probable bottom grounding scenarios whilst all side groundings are covered by the longer collision damages 7 2 1 1 damage generation based on the above a total of 1000 collision damages have been sampled for numerical simulations with a fixed damage length representing the maximum possible longitudinal breach based on solas damage statistics 60 m with all other damage characteristics having been sampled randomly the reason for this stems from the strong correlation between damage length and severity whereas other damage properties have a greater tendency to lead to more adverse outcomes at lesser extents in addition and deviating from general solas assumptions random values for the damage extent below the water line have been sampled from the distribution proposed in esafe bulian et al 2018 an illustration of the resultant damage sample is provided in fig 20 7 2 1 2 overview of simulation results the numerical simulation results have indicated that 34 cases will capsize within the given simulation time the cumulative distribution function for time to capsize ttc based on actual capsizes shows that the vessel achieves an equivalent survivability index of 96 6 see fig 21 by analysing the mode of loss across all loss scenarios 25 transient and 9 progressive flooding cases have been observed see fig 22 7 3 progressive flooding critical design features and solutions in alignment with the process outlined in the foregoing the simulation results pertaining to progressive flooding loss have been subjected to forensic analysis in order to identify and rank critical openings in accordance with this approach openings have been ranked in terms of frequency of involvement and floodwater mass transferred the results of this process are provided in fig 23 fig 24 and fig 25 7 4 implementation of flooding risk control options and results 7 4 1 transient flooding rcos passive protection abrupt nature of transient flooding renders active damage protection ineffective in this respect rcos must be built into the design offering instantly residual up righting moment in this respect due attention must be paid to causal and exacerbating design features including inadequate initial stability gm sources of asymmetry in subdivision ineffective subdivision high up in the ship insufficient reserve buoyancy and ineffective distribution of such the most effective rco is increasing gm but also the most difficult to achieve in this respect a few sources of asymmetric flooding were identified during the forensic analysis and eradicated e g connection between some port and starboard compartments introducing openings between some spaces and rendering some fire doors automatic in addition some void spaces in decks 2 and 3 were identified for installation of fixed foam arest p1 to provide additional reserve buoyancy including the installation of 4 partial bulkheads 7 4 2 progressive flooding rcos active protection a common form of active damage protection is counter ballasting but depending on the availability of relevant systems it can prove ineffective and untimely action phasing could render this counterproductive in addition the counterflooding process could give rise to slack tanks and subsequently introduce free surface effects which can compromise stability actuated systems are also available in the market e g macgregor actuated car deck doors but they are heavy expensive and inflexible in addition emergency response and crew action are some of the rcos being considered but the response is normally undirected and often unplanned leading to time wasting at best preparedness and readiness are also discussion topics but this comes with design and decision support ds integrated in the safety management system sms which are more esoteric than practical rcos with cs1 a close examination of the critical openings identified during the forensic analysis of the flooding process fig 14 and using the arteries vs veins analogy arest a2 system revealed that protecting 16 openings in the service corridor would eradicate all progressing flooding losses moreover accounting for functionality and ergonomics this led to considering only 6 deployable barriers spanning 6 8m to eradicate all progressive flooding losses 7 4 3 rcos implementation and impact passive and active flooding protection having identified and selected the aforementioned rcos and implemented these of the cruise ship cs1 all progressive flooding scenarios have been eradicated and only a handful of transient case still remain in which gravity wins and there is little that can be done about it the summary results are shown in table 3 below 8 concluding remarks deriving from the research presented in this paper the following remarks may be drawn scientific developments over the recent past afford forensic examination of the flooding process of a damaged ship leading to better understanding of the underlying mechanics and their evolution within the complex internal environment of modern cruise ships this feeds technological innovation for development of cost effective solutions to contain and control flooding risk in ships rendering ships virtually unsinkable this in turn raises societal expectations for maritime safety enhancement fuelling a virtuous circle that will close only if ships are designed built and operated with zero risk tolerance ultimately unsinkable ships credit
