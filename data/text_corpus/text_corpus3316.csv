16580,previous laboratory scale studies indicate nanofiltration nf and uv sulfite photochemical treatments as promising technologies for the removal and destruction respectively of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass from contaminated water this study reports on a field demonstration of a pilot scale hybrid nf and uv sulfite treatment train for the remediation of 12 pfass detected in groundwater impacted by aqueous film forming foam afff at a u s department of defense installation for most of the detected pfass nf rejection was consistently 95 over a 30 day field trial when operating at 90 total permeate recovery rejection of short chain perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas by nf decreased when recoveries increased from 90 to 97 tests with a reverse osmosis ro membrane showed 99 rejection of all pfass regardless of increasing recovery uv treatment of the nf reject following 90 permeate recovery resulted in variable destruction of individual pfass with rates also being dependent on ph and the identity and concentration of uv photosensitizer rates of perfluorocarboxylic acid pfca degradation were greater than those measured for pfsas and perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa precursors and were independent of perfluoroalkyl chain length in contrast rates of pfsa degradation increased with increasing chain length consistent levels of pfas degradation by uv sulfite were observed during a 30 day demonstration experiment in nf reject water amended with 10 mm sulfite and adjusted to ph 11 2 collectively 75 of the detected pfas mass in the nf reject was destroyed after 4 h of uv treatment increasing to 90 after 8 h of treatment an analysis of electrical energy inputs for the hybrid nf uv sulfite treatment train showed energy per order magnitude ee o requirements ranging from 13 1 kwh m3 for pfcas and 14 1 kwh m3 for pfos to values 100 kwh m3 for more recalcitrant short chain pfsa analogues the uv reactor and water cooling system were the major contributors to overall energy requirements and represent the greatest opportunities for improving efficiency of the technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas destruction membrane technologies hydrated electrons energy requirements emerging technologies afff 1 introduction the use of fire suppressing aqueous film forming foam afff at military and domestic fire training areas has contributed to the widespread contamination of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in water resources worldwide barzen hanson et al 2017 hu et al 2016 pfass are highly recalcitrant and have been associated with various adverse human health effects usepa 2016a 2016b as a result the u s environmental protection agency usepa established lifetime health advisory levels hal of 70 ng l for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa combined usepa 2016a 2016b with individual states setting more stringent guidelines for these and other commonly detected pfass simon et al 2019 conventional water and wastewater treatment methods are largely ineffective at removing pfass instead separation based advanced water treatment methods such as adsorbents e g granular activated carbon gac and anion exchange resins aers laura del moral et al 2020 and high pressure membranes e g nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro liu et al 2021 are used to treat pfass an advantage to high pressure membranes is the effective rejection of shorter chain pfass that are less effectively removed by gac and aer laura del moral et al 2020 liu et al 2019 recent work has also shown the effective rejection of a broader suite of pfass including many precursors of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas detected in afff using high resolution mass spectroscopy suspect screening methods liu et al 2021 there is growing interest in technologies that can degrade pfass and active research is underway for development of destructive technologies such as plasma nau hix et al 2021 electrochemical le et al 2019 hydrothermal wu et al 2019 and photochemical processes tenorio et al 2020 recently the hydrated electron eaq a highly reactive reductant generated by uv photosensitizer processes e 2 9 v buxton et al 1988 has garnered attention due to its ability to reductively defluorinate a wide range of pfass including perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas and pfaa precursors bentel et al 2020 bentel et al 2019 cui et al 2020 park et al 2009 sun et al 2018 tenorio et al 2020 uv photochemical processes can be readily implemented due to the widespread availability of uv lamps and reactors as well as chemical photosensitizers used to generate hydrated electrons e g sodium sulfite hydrated electrons may also be generated through the combination of medium pressure uv lamps and an electrode and similarly used to effectively degrade pfass rao et al 2020 su et al 2019 while destruction of pfass is desirable direct treatment of contaminated water supplies with these technologies may not be practical due to their large energy requirements per unit volume of water treated bentel et al 2020 instead destruction is anticipated to be more practical when applied to treat small volume concentrate streams generated as byproducts of separation based processes including membrane reject concentrate streams generated by nf and ro treatment to better represent full scale treatment pilot scale assessments of membrane separation and destructive processes are necessary to date studies applying high pressure membranes for pfas treatment have been largely conducted using bench scale flat sheet membrane systems appleman et al 2013 that may not be representative of treatment achieved at full scale using spiral wound membranes due to changing conditions along the length of the element fujioka et al 2014 similarly uv sulfite treatment of pfass has been primarily limited to small volume 1 l bench scale reactors treating pfass spiked into deionized water matrices bentel et al 2020 sun et al 2018 tenorio et al 2020 little is known about the degradation of pfass in real contaminated natural water matrices e g groundwater using reactors representative of full scale uv treatment systems based on promising laboratory scale studies demonstrating the effective rejection and destruction of pfass in afff impacted waters by high pressure membranes liu et al 2021 and uv sulfite tenorio et al 2020 respectively this contribution reports the results of a pilot scale treatment train combining nf and uv sulfite technologies to treat afff impacted groundwater at a u s department of defense dod installation nf was operated in recirculating semi batch mode to 90 total water recovery producing a 10 reject byproduct stream that was then fed into a uv reactor amended with sulfite photosensitizer to promote pfas degradation long term nf and uv operation was monitored and validated over 30 days the effect of total water recovery on rejection of pfass by both nf and ro membranes was also assessed uv treatment of the membrane reject was monitored throughout the study and the effects of operating conditions including ph and photosensitizer identity and concentration were evaluated findings from this study provide valuable insights into the viability of using these technologies both separately and combined for remediation of afff impacted water resources 2 methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo sodium hydroxide naoh 97 purity was used for ph adjustment sodium sulfite na2so3 9 8 potassium iodide ki 99 9 and nitrilotriacetic acid nta 98 were used as photosensitizers to generate eaq in separate uv experiments most experiments were conducted to treat pfass present in the source groundwater but select experiments were performed by spiking groundwater with higher concentrations of five commonly detected pfass 0 5 μg l perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa 98 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa 95 perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs 97 perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs 98 and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos 98 2 2 nf and uv sulfite treatment train the nf and uv sulfite treatment train was deployed at a u s dod installation in colorado to treat historical afff impacted groundwater at a monitoring well fig 1 shows a simplified process diagram autocad and photographs of the demonstration system a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system labview was used to automate the treatment train and record process variables briefly a typical 1 day treatment cycle was operated according to the following pfas contaminated groundwater was pumped from a monitoring well and stored in a 757 l 200 gal storage tank 568 l 150 gal groundwater from the storage tank was pumped through sediment and cation exchange pretreatment cartridge filters into a second 757 l nf concentration tank water from the nf concentration tank was passed through the nf system in recirculating fashion until 90 permeate recovery was achieved and producing a 10 reject byproduct stream containing concentrated pfass the resulting nf reject was then transferred to a 57 l 15 gal uv reactor tank the nf reject was amended with photosensitizer typically 10 mm sodium sulfite and naoh for ph adjustment and recirculated through an annular uv reactor for 23 h of treatment prior to discharge all treated water nf permeate uv treated water was passed through a gac polishing filter prior to final discharge as a precaution to remove residual pfass 2 2 1 pretreatment as groundwater is concentrated to high recoveries fouling scaling of membranes and uv quartz sleeves due to suspended solids and sparingly soluble salts primarily ca2 and mg2 precipitates may adversely impact treatment to address these concerns raw groundwater was pretreated by filtering sequentially through 50 20 and 5 μm sediment filters wb hb 20 harmsco followed by five cation exchange cartridge filters ws 20bb pentek in series multiple cation exchange filters were used to reduce replacement frequency in full scale practice these would likely be replaced by a regenerable ion exchange softening system or other water softening process but disposable cartridge filters were used here for convenience sediment and cation exchange filters were replaced after 30 and 13 days of operation respectively 2 2 2 nf pilot the custom built high pressure membrane system contained three 2540 2 5 diameter 40 length spiral wound nf270 membranes nf dupont filmtec midland mi characteristics provided in the supplementary information si table s1 and was used to treat 568 l batches of groundwater to 90 total permeate recovery and yielding 57 l of reject during each treatment cycle 3 5 h treatment time one treatment cycle was conducted per day during the field deployment all membrane experiments were operated at a conservative single pass permeate flux of 18 8 lmh and 28 single pass recovery approximately 6 3 lmh or 9 3 recovery per element with slight differences between membranes in series and single pass reject flowrate of 6 2 l min here recovery or permeate recovery refers to the reduction in volume i e generally 90 volume reduction from 568 to 57 l during nf semi batch operation whereas single pass recovery is a function of membrane flux and feed flowrate that was fixed at 28 for all experiments operating conditions were selected to balance the time required to reach 90 permeate recovery system operating limitations and membrane integrity separate experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of increasing recovery up to 97 on rejection of pfass by both nf and ro espa hydranautics oceanside ca table s1 membranes using the aforementioned operating conditions but at slightly longer operating times to achieve the higher recovery 2 2 3 uv pilot a pilot scale uv system lbx 90e consisting of a uv reactor electrical control box and wiper was obtained from xylem inc rye brook ny and mounted on a custom built skid the reactor contained four 330 w low pressure high output mercury lamps elr 30 generating λ 254 nm wavelength light no ozone generation installed in quartz sleeves that were cleaned hourly with a mechanical wiping mechanism the reactor was equipped with a uv intensity sensor w m2 placed in the middle of the reactor and the lamps were operated at 100 power for all experiments all uv treatment experiments were performed using 57 l of reject following 90 recovery from the nf system which was transferred into a 57 l tank where naoh ph adjustment and the selected chemical sensitizer usually sodium sulfite were dosed the dead volume of the reactor was approximately 45 l including chemical additions the total uv treatment volume for each cycle was 59 l no gas sparging of the uv reactor or reject to remove dissolved oxygen was performed before uv treatment the uv water temperature was maintained at 26 5 0 5 c water was recirculated through the uv reactor for 23 h at 14 4 lpm 3 8 gpm initial experiments were performed to assess the impact of ph sulfite concentration and chemical sensitizer identity on treatment and to identify optimal treatment conditions long term 30 day experiments were then performed at the optimal conditions identified table s3 summarizes estimated uv doses and dose based rate constants and table s6 lists measured uv intensity uv254 t and sulfite concentration 2 6 water analysis targeted pfas analysis 50 compounds and suspect screening protocols described elsewhere liu et al 2021 were performed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry using authentic reference standards lc qtof ms sciex framingham ma x500r qtof system additional information on pfas analytical methods limits of quantification loq table s2 and general water quality parameter measurements can be found in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater characterization twelve pfass were quantified in the source groundwater including 4 pfcas pfpea pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa 6 pfsas pfprs pfbs pfpes pfhxs pfhps and pfos and 2 pfaa precursors fhxsa and 6 2 fts suspect screening analysis of the groundwater was also conducted but no additional compounds could be confidently identified pfas concentrations in the groundwater source were monitored for 30 days and did not vary significantly as shown in fig s1a and b average concentrations are listed in table 1 concentrations of pfsas were generally higher than pfcas as reported in many historical afff usage sites hu et al 2016 the presence of odd and even chain pfass elevated concentrations of even chain pfsas i e pfhxs pfos and the presence of a fluorotelomer sulfonate detected in the groundwater indicates site contamination from afffs produced by both electrochemical fluorination and telomerization processes moody and field 2000 analysis of general water quality parameters showed no significant variations over the course of the field trial table s4 pfas concentrations did not change following pretreatment by sediment and cation exchange filters data not shown the major effect of pretreatment was the desired removal of ca2 and mg2 by the cation exchange cartridges it is also worth noting that pfas concentrations in the source water at the time of the field trial were appreciably lower than those measured during site selection activities conducted prior to deployment indicating transiency of the pfas source at the site regardless the sensitivity of the lc qtof ms methods allowed for analysis of treatment efficacy despite the low initial pfas concentrations 3 2 high pressure membrane performance 3 2 1 impact of recovery on rejection of pfass initial experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of total system permeate recovery on the rejection of pfass by nf and ro rejection as a function of recovery from 90 to 97 is shown in fig 2 for nf 2a and b and ro 2c and d both membranes were operated at the same conditions 18 8 lmh permeate flux and 6 2 l min reject flowrate and rejection was calculated using the loq concentration when measured pfas concentrations were loq table s2 rejection of pfass by nf calculated using the influent and permeate concentrations at the specified recovery was 95 at all recoveries with the exception of shorter chain pfsas pfbs and pfprs which were rejected between 88 and 93 as recovery was increased to 97 rejection of shorter chain pfass pfprs pfbs pfpea pfhxa by nf decreased fig 2a and b likely due to the increased concentration of pfass and dissolved ionic species in the concentrated feed stream liu et al 2021 however rejection of longer chain pfass was not significantly affected when operating at higher recoveries possibly due to an enhanced sieving effect from foulants such as dissolved organic carbon doc appleman et al 2013 previous work demonstrated the effective rejection of pfass by ro to permeate concentrations loq liu et al 2021 thus to enhance the likelihood of detecting pfass in ro permeate five pfass pfhxa pfoa pfbs pfhxs and pfos were spiked into the groundwater at concentrations of 0 5 μg l each prior to evaluating ro performance even with the elevated feed concentrations observed rejection of all pfass by ro was 99 regardless of permeate recovery demonstrating superior rejection of ro compared to nf fig 2c and d a combination of electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion likely contributes to the overall high rejection of pfass by nf and ro membranes appleman et al 2013 electrostatic repulsion occurs between the negatively charged membrane polymers at groundwater ph 7 3 table s1 and the anionic pfcas pfsas and 6 2 fts because fhxsa is likely neutral at ph 7 3 nguyen et al 2020 due to the sulfonamide headgroup rejection by nf was consistently lower than the anionic analogue pfhxs attributed to the lack of an electrostatic repulsion rejection mechanism for this compound fig 2b the effective rejection of pfass due to size exclusion by nf and ro is consistent with the molecular weights of pfass evaluated in this study 250 500 g mol being higher than the molecular weight cutoff of the nf 180 g mol and ro 100 g mol membranes table s1 increased size exclusion is likely responsible for the higher rejection observed for longer chain pfass by nf although ro was more effective than nf in rejecting pfass ro requires higher operating pressures than nf liu et al 2021 and retains greater concentrations of groundwater constituents measured at 97 permeate recovery such as sodium 3000 mg l compared to 1700 mg l nitrate 370 mg l compared to 4 mg l silica 270 mg l compared to 12 mg l and doc 100 mg l compared to 37 mg l table s5 in the ro concentrate than in the nf concentrate high concentrations of these groundwater constituents can promote more membrane fouling scaling introduce greater concentrate management challenges and inhibit photochemical treatment of pfass in the reject stream for example preventing accumulation of nitrate in the membrane reject much lower concentration in nf reject than ro reject is critical because nitrate is an effective scavenger of eaq cui et al 2020 3 2 2 nf long term performance following the tests described above the nf pilot system was operated to 90 permeate recovery to achieve pfas removal while minimizing potential for membrane fouling to evaluate long term performance of the nf uv sulfite treatment train one treatment cycle was performed in an automated fashion each day for 30 consecutive days one treatment cycle consists of concentrating groundwater to 90 permeate recovery by the nf membrane followed by uv sulfite treatment of the nf reject on 13 of the 30 days samples were collected for analysis to assess performance of the nf and uv sulfite unit processes 30 day treatment performance of uv sulfite is discussed later in section 3 3 4 fig 3 depicts rejection of pfass by the nf membrane over 30 days showing both permeate concentrations open symbols and rejection closed symbols corresponding pfas concentrations in the nf reject stream are shown in fig s1c and d and average concentrations are listed in table 1 rejection of individual pfass was generally consistent over the 30 concentration cycles average rejection varied between 92 and 98 for individual pfass consistent with those shown in fig 2 longer chain pfass were rejected to a higher degree than shorter chain analogues comparison of the nf reject concentrations and the raw groundwater table 1 shows that pfass were concentrated in the byproduct reject stream increasing by a factor consistent with 90 recovery and the measured permeate concentrations fig 3 concentrating pfass to a small volume reject stream is expected to reduce the requirements for uv treatment pfas mass reduction goals a temporary decrease in rejection of pfass was observed around day 6 corresponding to operational error when cation exchange cartridge filter change out was delayed resulting in breakthrough of ca2 and mg2 in the nf feed stream table s4 divalent cationic species such as ca2 and mg2 have been shown to decrease rejection of organic compounds due to reducing negative membrane surface charge or by forming dom ca 2 complexes causing increased membrane fouling lee et al 2005 rejection values observed in the field 92 98 were similar to those reported recently for treatment of a similar groundwater performed in the laboratory liu et al 2021 a small initial increase in membrane permeability as represented by temperature corrected specific flux eq s1 was observed in the first 5 concentration cycles followed by small but continuous decrease in the subsequent 25 concentration cycles fig 4 the small decline in membrane permeability suggests membrane fouling occurred and that longer term operation might benefit from modifying operating conditions such as reducing single pass membrane recovery 9 3 per element reducing total system permeate recovery 90 increasing crossflow velocity 6 2 l min reject flowrate or changing membrane cleaning protocols which consisted only of daily membrane system flushes for 15 min still results show that the nf system can reliably recover 90 permeate while effectively rejecting pfass over an extended period of operation 3 3 uv treatment of pfass in nf reject 3 3 1 general trends and impact of ph on uv sulfite treatment tests were first conducted to optimize uv treatment of pfass that accumulated in the nf reject stream byproduct following 90 permeate recovery a pseudo first order kinetic model was applied to obtain rate constants for individual pfass in all treatment conditions fig 5 shows the effects of ph fig 5a and b photosensitizer identify fig 5c and d and sulfite dose fig 5e and f on the observed rate constants for degradation of individual pfass k obs h 1 a complete listing of rate constants is provided in table s8 and measured residual concentrations at each sampling time are shown in figs s2 4 degradation of pfcas occurred more quickly than pfsas and pfaa precursors under all conditions with no apparent difference being noted for pfcas of different chain lengths fig 5a in contrast rates of degradation observed for pfsas increased with increasing chain length fig 5b observed degradation trends among the different pfass are consistent with earlier reports using laboratory batch reactors and deionized matrix solutions ph 9 5 amended with various pfass and afff mixtures bentel et al 2019 tenorio et al 2020 fhxsa a sulfonamide based pfas degraded at a similar rate as pfhxs fig 5b indicating that the sulfonamide head group both have a 6 c perfluorinated chain does not have significant impact on degradation however the degradation rate constants measured for 6 2 fts which also has a 6 carbon polyfluorinated chain were less than those measured for fhxsa and pfhxs possibly due to the generation of 6 2 fts c c0 1 at early timepoints fig s2d during uv treatment transient generation of 6 2 fts and other pfass during uv based treatment processes in afff impacted waters has been observed in laboratory studies tenorio et al 2020 and attributed to the conversion of 6 2 fts precursors that were not identified using the existing lc qtof ms targeted or suspect screening analysis methods the slower degradation of 6 2 fts compared to pfhxs may also be attributed to the presence of a non fluorinated ch2ch2 group adjacent to the sulfonate headgroup similar to findings in a recent report showing slower degradation of fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas compared to fully fluorinated pfcas bentel et al 2019 the ph of the nf reject prior to uv sulfite treatment had a pronounced effect on degradation of pfass with k obs values for pfcas increasing 6 fold when ph was increased from 9 5 to 11 2 prior to uv treatment the effect for pfos was even more dramatic increasing 12 fold from ph 9 5 to 11 2 previous laboratory scale studies have also observed similar enhancement in reaction rates in alkaline conditions bentel et al 2020 qu et al 2014 although the underlying mechanism is still under investigation bentel et al 2020 attributed the increase in reaction rate of pfcas pfsas were not investigated in alkaline conditions ph 12 to an increase in the probability of a decarboxylation hydroxylation elimination hydrolysis degradation pathway occurring thereby cleaving more c f bonds in the pfas 3 3 2 impact of chemical sensitizer alternative photosensitizers for eaq generation including nitrilotriacetate nta sun et al 2018 and potassium iodide ki qu et al 2010 were compared with sulfite fig 5c and d at equimolar concentrations i e 10 mm compared to uv sulfite degradation of pfcas in uv nta was 1 5 times faster whereas pfsas and pfaa precursors were degraded more slowly using nta than sulfite this finding contrasts with earlier laboratory studies showing faster degradation of pfos in deionized water matrix amended with nta compared to sulfite ph 10 2 mm photosensitizer sun et al 2018 the inconsistencies in treatment may be attributed to interactions between nta and groundwater matrix constituents or differences in operating conditions ph 10 and 2 mm nta sun et al 2018 compared to ph 11 2 and 10 mm nta this study however it is worth noting that uv photolysis of nta produces pungent odors likely as a result of amine or urea byproducts and may pose practical challenges for treatment applications in comparison the major byproduct of sulfite photolysis is sulfate which is ubiquitous in most groundwaters in contrast to sulfite and nta little to no degradation of any of the pfass was observed when ki was used as the photosensitizer in contrast to prior laboratory studies qu et al 2014 2010 the lack of reactivity may be due to enhanced scavenging of eaq by iodide intermediates when applying ki concentrations higher than 0 3 mm qu et al 2010 collectively results support the use of sulfite as the optimal uv sensitizer for pfas treatment in this groundwater 3 3 3 impact of sulfite concentration finally tests evaluated the effects of varying sulfite dose at ph 11 2 a uv only control no sulfite added showed only a small amount of degradation for pfcas after 8 h of irradiation time fig s5 consistent with earlier reports bao et al 2018 guo et al 2019 qu et al 2014 2010 this also shows that eaq generated from photolysis of organic matter zepp et al 1987 did not contribute significantly to pfas degradation increasing sulfite concentration from 5 to 20 mm generally resulted in increased degradation rates fig 5e and f for pfcas degradation rates were similar at 5 and 10 mm sulfite but increased 3 fold when the sulfite concentration increased to 20 mm for pfsas and pfaa precursors degradation rates doubled between 5 mm and 10 mm sulfite but then increased less dramatically 1 5x when sulfite was increased to 20 mm these enhancements in pfas transformation rate are likely the result of an increased rate of eaq formation due to higher sulfite concentrations however at higher sulfite concentrations light absorption begins to plateau resulting in diminishing returns uv254 t 69 8 0 5 5 mm 50 8 3 7 10 mm 34 2 0 3 20 mm in contrast previous bench scale studies have reported either no significant increases in pfas treatment at sulfite concentrations 10 mm tenorio et al 2020 or only slight improvements i e 10 gu et al 2017 the discrepancies may be attributed to the multiple high wattage lamps 4 330 w used in this study that provide more photons to react with the higher sulfite concentrations and generate more eaq for pfas degradation compared to the single low wattage lamps 10 18 w used in the bench scale studies given the fast degradation of pfcas compared to pfsas system operating conditions will generally be dictated by pfsa removal where increased sulfite concentrations 10 mm has limited benefit thus longer term tests were conducted using nf reject adjusted to ph 11 2 and amended with 10 mm sulfite before uv irradiation 3 3 4 uv sulfite long term performance automated uv sulfite treatment of the nf reject generated daily for 30 consecutive days was performed to assess stability of the treatment system degradation trends of pfass by uv sulfite were consistent over 30 days as shown in fig 6 for select pfass and reflected treatment trends observed in validation experiments already discussed fig 5 pfcas were consistently removed within 2 h of treatment regardless of compound chain length and pfsas were degraded according to chain length with pfos being removed within 4 h averaged c c0 values for all pfass shown in fig s6 concentrations listed in table s7 although shorter chain pfsas were more calcitrant mass reductions of shorter chain pfsas were still significant with 75 of pfhxs and 20 of pfbs degraded after 4 h of treatment after 23 h only pfprs and pfbs remain in solution with 50 and 70 respectively degraded in 23 h fig s6 the majority 55 of total quantified pfas mass was removed in the first 2 h of treatment increasing to 76 in 4 h 90 in 8 h and 97 after 23 h fig 7 the consistent treatment of pfass by uv sulfite over 30 days indicates minimal accumulation of foulants on the quartz sleeves and that pretreatment efforts sediment and cation exchange cartridge filters and automated sleeve wiping hourly were effective at sustaining overall system performance concentrations of the sulfite sensitizer were also monitored during uv sulfite treatment a consistent 2 5 mm sulfite loss at the beginning of each reaction was observed table s6 possibly attributed to sulfite reaction with dissolved oxygen present in the nf reject water no effort was made to deoxygenate with gas sparging a common practice in laboratory experiments a separate experiment performed by spiking sulfite into an aliquot of deoxygenated n2 sparged reject water confirmed no oxidation of sulfite by other water matrix constituents although water could be actively deoxygenated by inert gas sparging results suggest that sulfite addition is an efficient strategy for removing dissolved oxygen upon uv irradiation sulfite concentrations decayed slowly following a pseudo first order rate law kobs 0 075 0 027 h 1 r2 0 97 0 02 and decreasing to 1 6 0 7 mm after 23 h of irradiation further work is suggested to optimize dosing schemes to accelerate pfas degradation and or minimize unreacted residuals in the treated water 3 4 electrical costs and treatment outlook results from the 30 day continuous treatment experiments were used to determine energy requirements for the overall hybrid nf uv sulfite treatment process where nf was operated to 90 permeate recovery and the times required to destroy 90 of individual pfass during uv sulfite treatment of the reject water were used to estimate electrical energy per order ee o kwh m3 values for treatment of individual pfass the volume used to calculate ee o was the total volume of water treated 568 l 150 gal fig 8 shows the results of ee o estimates for each of the target pfass considering all electrical draws required for the treatment train including miscellaneous nf and uv associated operations water chilling and scada control detailed energy consumption breakdowns in table s9 differences in ee o estimates between individual target pfass reflect the varying uv sulfite reaction times required to achieve 90 reduction in concentration based on 30 day kobs values table s8 a single ee o value is estimated for pfcas evaluated in this study c5 c8 using a treatment time of 2 h due to rapid degradation of these compounds fig 6 in aggregate required ee o values were similar for pfcas 13 1 kwh m3 and pfos 14 1 kwh m3 energy requirements for treatment then increased with decreasing chain length for pfsas with ee o values roughly doubling for every decrease in cf2 in pfsa carbon chain length reflecting the inertness of these structures to uv sulfite treatment thus while uv sulfite treatment of nf reject concentrates may be viable for pfcas and longer chain pfsas e g pfhxs and longer treatment of the shorter chain pfsas such as pfprs and pfbs would likely be prohibitively energy intensive ee o 100 kwh m3 ee o values for fhxsa and 6 2 fts were much greater than that estimated for pfhxs respectively again reflecting the differences in k obs values measured for these pfass indicating a pre oxidation step may be considered for more cost effective removal of these compounds examining the different contributing factors to the total energy requirements the energy requirements for the nf membrane process was 2 8 kwh m3 to achieve 90 permeate recovery or 20 of the total energy requirements for pfca and pfos ee o nf energy requirements would vary with recovery due to variable treatment times in comparison the uv reactor and associated water cooling needs represent the major contributors to the energy requirements for treatment while water cooling mainly of the uv reactor was a significant source of energy consumption 37 it is possible that most of these inputs could be eliminated in an optimized full scale process where passive cooling could be used as an alternative e g using the much larger nf permeate flow as a coolant stream uv led technologies may also be used to reduce the energy costs associated with treatment as the technology advances and becomes more cost effective than traditional mercury lamps results from a recent laboratory scale uv sulfite study treating 600 ml of water with 18 w lp uv lamp ph 12 and 10 mm sulfite reported an ee o for pfoa of 15 8 kwh m3 bentel et al 2020 which is 2 5 times greater than the 6 44 kwh m3 observed here for the uv sulfite process alone table s9 this suggests that there are efficiencies gained by combining nf and uv sulfite for treatment or by pilot scale reactor configuration results also show that the hybrid nf uv sulfite treatment train compares favorably with ee o values reported recently for other destructive technologies not operated as a treatment train including a pilot scale demonstration of a plasma technology for treatment of pfoa and pfos 16 6 kwh m3 nau hix et al 2021 pilot scale photocatalytic process for treatment of pfoa 51 5 kwh m3 qanbarzadeh et al 2020 and bench scale electrochemical oxidation of pfoa and pfos 5 1 and 6 7 kwh m3 respectively le et al 2019 as discussed previously ee o calculations for this study were based on the total volume of water treated 568 l rather than the concentrated volume of water treated in the uv reactor 57 l indicating that energy costs for pfas degradation are less by the combination of nf and uv sulfite than by uv sulfite itself if ee o values were instead calculated based on volume of water treated by uv only then ee o values for uv treatment would be 10 greater i e 64 4 kwh m3 for pfoa and 71 2 kwh m3 for pfos destruction of pfass remains highly energy intensive when compared with other water treatment operations for context ro seawater desalination requires 2 5 4 kwh m3 zarzo and prats 2018 from an operating perspective the high uv doses required for treatment accumulated 128 000 mj cm2 over 2 h and 282 000 mj cm2 over 4 h for pfca and pfos degradation respectively table s3 indicate significant challenges to utilizing uv sulfite in existing single pass uv disinfection facilities or as a replacement for existing pfas remediation strategies such as continuous flow adsorption based treatment technologies additionally ph adjustment to 11 2 and subsequent neutralization may incur additional operating challenges and costs nevertheless this study demonstrates that both nf and uv sulfite may be more viable pfas treatment technologies when combined high pressure membranes are not frequently used for pfas treatment due to concentrate management challenges uv sulfite treatment and by extension other destructive technologies may leverage the benefits of waste volume reduction to reduce energy requirements for pfas mass destruction operations 4 conclusion this contribution reported on the results of a field demonstration pilot scale hybrid nf uv sulfite treatment train for the separation and destruction of pfass from afff impacted groundwater initial tests showed that high pressure membranes can achieve good rejection 95 of most pfass at high permeate recoveries with performance being sustained throughout a 30 day consecutive field trial pfass were concentrated in the resulting nf reject stream significantly reducing the volume of water requiring further treatment pfas destruction was accomplished by uv treatment after amending the nf reject with sulfite photosensitizer to generate eaq and adjusting to alkaline ph conditions ph 11 2 rates of destruction observed for individual pfass were consistent with trends reported in small scale laboratory studies with pfcas and longer chain pfsas being readily degraded while shorter chain pfsas and 6 2 fts were degraded much more slowly sulfite proved to be a preferable sensitizer to nta and ki and treatment at lower ph conditions was less effective analysis of electrical energy inputs showed that the hybrid nf uv sulfite process was competitive with other technologies for pfas destruction the uv treatment step and associated cooling requirements dominated energy inputs which varied for different pfass work aimed at optimizing passive cooling

16580,previous laboratory scale studies indicate nanofiltration nf and uv sulfite photochemical treatments as promising technologies for the removal and destruction respectively of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass from contaminated water this study reports on a field demonstration of a pilot scale hybrid nf and uv sulfite treatment train for the remediation of 12 pfass detected in groundwater impacted by aqueous film forming foam afff at a u s department of defense installation for most of the detected pfass nf rejection was consistently 95 over a 30 day field trial when operating at 90 total permeate recovery rejection of short chain perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas by nf decreased when recoveries increased from 90 to 97 tests with a reverse osmosis ro membrane showed 99 rejection of all pfass regardless of increasing recovery uv treatment of the nf reject following 90 permeate recovery resulted in variable destruction of individual pfass with rates also being dependent on ph and the identity and concentration of uv photosensitizer rates of perfluorocarboxylic acid pfca degradation were greater than those measured for pfsas and perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa precursors and were independent of perfluoroalkyl chain length in contrast rates of pfsa degradation increased with increasing chain length consistent levels of pfas degradation by uv sulfite were observed during a 30 day demonstration experiment in nf reject water amended with 10 mm sulfite and adjusted to ph 11 2 collectively 75 of the detected pfas mass in the nf reject was destroyed after 4 h of uv treatment increasing to 90 after 8 h of treatment an analysis of electrical energy inputs for the hybrid nf uv sulfite treatment train showed energy per order magnitude ee o requirements ranging from 13 1 kwh m3 for pfcas and 14 1 kwh m3 for pfos to values 100 kwh m3 for more recalcitrant short chain pfsa analogues the uv reactor and water cooling system were the major contributors to overall energy requirements and represent the greatest opportunities for improving efficiency of the technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas destruction membrane

has contributed to the widespread contamination of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in water resources worldwide barzen hanson et al 2017 hu et al 2016 pfass are highly recalcitrant and have been associated with various adverse human health effects usepa 2016a 2016b as a result the u s environmental protection agency usepa established lifetime health advisory levels hal of 70 ng l for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa combined usepa 2016a 2016b with individual states setting more stringent guidelines for these and other commonly detected pfass simon et al 2019 conventional water and wastewater treatment methods are largely ineffective at removing pfass instead separation based advanced water treatment methods such as adsorbents e g granular activated carbon gac and anion exchange resins aers laura del moral et al 2020 and high pressure membranes e g nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro liu et al 2021 are used to treat pfass an advantage to high pressure membranes is the effective rejection of shorter chain pfass that are less effectively removed by gac and aer laura del moral et al 2020 liu et al 2019 recent work has also shown the effective rejection of a broader suite of pfass including many precursors of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas detected in afff using high resolution mass spectroscopy suspect screening methods liu et al 2021 there is growing interest in technologies that can degrade pfass and active research is underway for development of destructive technologies such as plasma nau hix et al 2021 electrochemical le et al 2019 hydrothermal wu et al 2019 and photochemical processes tenorio et al 2020 recently the hydrated electron eaq a highly reactive reductant generated by uv photosensitizer processes e 2 9 v buxton et al 1988 has garnered attention due to its ability to reductively defluorinate a wide range of pfass including perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas

availability of uv lamps and reactors as well as chemical photosensitizers used to generate hydrated electrons e g sodium sulfite hydrated electrons may also be generated through the combination of medium pressure uv lamps and an electrode and similarly used to effectively degrade pfass rao et al 2020 su et al 2019 while destruction of pfass is desirable direct treatment of contaminated water supplies with these technologies may not be practical due to their large energy requirements per unit volume of water treated bentel et al 2020 instead destruction is anticipated to be more practical when applied to treat small volume concentrate streams generated as byproducts of separation based processes including membrane reject concentrate streams generated by nf and ro treatment to better represent full scale treatment pilot scale assessments of membrane separation and destructive processes are necessary to date studies applying high pressure membranes for pfas treatment have been largely conducted using bench scale flat sheet membrane systems appleman et al 2013 that may not be representative of treatment achieved at full scale using spiral wound membranes due to changing conditions along the length of the element fujioka et al 2014 similarly uv sulfite treatment of pfass has been primarily limited to small volume 1 l bench scale reactors treating pfass spiked into deionized water matrices bentel et al 2020 sun et al 2018 tenorio et al 2020 little is known about the degradation of pfass in real contaminated natural water matrices e g groundwater using reactors representative of full scale uv treatment systems based on promising laboratory scale studies demonstrating the effective rejection and destruction of pfass in afff impacted waters by high pressure membranes liu et al 2021 and uv sulfite tenorio et al 2020 respectively this contribution reports the results of a pilot scale treatment train combining nf and uv sulfite technologies to treat afff impacted groundwater at a u s department of defense dod installation nf was operated in recirculating semi batch mode to 90 total water recovery producing a 10 reject byproduct stream that was then fed into a uv reactor amended with sulfite photosensitizer to promote pfas degradation long term nf and uv operation was monitored and validated over 30 days the effect of total water recovery on rejection of pfass by both nf and ro membranes was also assessed uv treatment of the membrane reject was monitored throughout the study and the effects of operating conditions including ph and photosensitizer identity and concentration were evaluated findings from this study provide valuable insights into the viability of using these technologies both separately and combined for remediation of afff impacted water resources 2 methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo sodium hydroxide naoh 97 purity was used for ph adjustment sodium sulfite na2so3 9 8 potassium iodide ki 99 9 and nitrilotriacetic acid nta 98 were used as photosensitizers to generate eaq in separate uv experiments most experiments were conducted to treat pfass present in the source groundwater but select experiments were performed by spiking groundwater with higher concentrations of five commonly detected pfass 0 5 μg l perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa 98 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa 95 perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs 97 perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs 98 and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos 98 2 2 nf and uv sulfite treatment train the nf and uv sulfite treatment train was deployed at a u s dod installation in colorado to treat historical afff impacted groundwater at a monitoring well fig 1 shows a simplified process diagram autocad and photographs of the demonstration system a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system labview was used to automate the treatment train and record process variables briefly a typical 1 day treatment cycle was operated according to the following pfas contaminated groundwater was pumped from a monitoring well and stored in a 757 l 200 gal storage tank 568 l 150 gal groundwater from the storage tank was pumped through sediment and cation exchange pretreatment cartridge filters into a second 757 l nf concentration tank water from the nf concentration tank was passed through the nf system in recirculating fashion until 90 permeate recovery was achieved and producing a 10 reject byproduct stream containing concentrated pfass the resulting nf reject was then transferred to a 57 l 15 gal uv reactor tank the nf reject was amended with photosensitizer typically 10 mm sodium sulfite and naoh for ph adjustment and recirculated through an annular uv reactor for 23 h of treatment prior to discharge all treated water nf permeate uv treated water was passed through a gac polishing filter prior to final discharge as a precaution to remove residual pfass 2 2 1 pretreatment as groundwater is concentrated to high recoveries fouling scaling of membranes and uv quartz sleeves due to suspended solids and sparingly soluble salts primarily ca2 and mg2 precipitates may adversely impact treatment to address these concerns raw groundwater was pretreated by filtering sequentially through 50 20 and 5 μm sediment filters wb hb 20 harmsco followed by five cation exchange cartridge filters ws 20bb pentek in series multiple cation exchange filters were used to reduce replacement frequency in full scale practice these would likely be replaced by a regenerable ion exchange softening system or other water softening process but disposable cartridge filters were used here for convenience sediment and cation exchange filters were replaced after 30 and 13 days of operation respectively 2 2 2 nf pilot the custom built high pressure membrane system contained three 2540 2 5 diameter 40 length spiral wound nf270 membranes nf dupont filmtec midland mi characteristics provided in the supplementary information si table s1 and was used to treat 568 l batches of groundwater to 90 total permeate recovery and yielding 57 l of reject during each treatment cycle 3 5 h treatment time one treatment cycle was conducted per day during the field deployment all membrane experiments were operated at a conservative single pass permeate flux of 18 8 lmh and 28 single pass recovery approximately 6 3 lmh or 9 3 recovery per element with slight differences between membranes in series and single pass reject flowrate of 6 2 l min here recovery or permeate recovery refers to the reduction in volume i e generally 90 volume reduction from 568 to 57 l during nf semi batch operation whereas single pass recovery is a function of membrane flux and feed flowrate that was fixed at 28 for all experiments operating conditions were selected to balance the time required to reach 90 permeate recovery system operating limitations and membrane integrity separate experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of increasing recovery up to 97 on rejection of pfass by both nf and ro espa hydranautics oceanside ca table s1 membranes using the aforementioned operating conditions but at slightly longer operating times to achieve the higher recovery 2 2 3 uv pilot a pilot scale uv system lbx 90e consisting of a uv reactor electrical control box and wiper was obtained from xylem inc rye brook ny and mounted on a custom built skid the reactor contained four 330 w low pressure high output mercury lamps elr 30 generating λ 254 nm wavelength light no ozone generation installed in quartz sleeves that were cleaned hourly with a mechanical wiping mechanism the reactor was equipped with a uv intensity sensor w m2 placed in the middle of the reactor and the lamps were operated at 100 power for all experiments all uv treatment experiments were performed using 57 l of reject following 90 recovery from the nf system which was transferred into a 57 l tank where naoh ph adjustment and the selected chemical sensitizer usually sodium sulfite were dosed the dead volume of the reactor was approximately 45 l including chemical additions the total uv treatment volume for each cycle was 59 l no gas sparging of the uv reactor or reject to remove dissolved oxygen was performed before uv treatment the uv water temperature was maintained at 26 5 0 5 c water was recirculated through the uv reactor for 23 h at 14 4 lpm 3 8 gpm initial experiments were performed to assess the impact of ph sulfite concentration and chemical sensitizer identity on treatment and to identify optimal treatment conditions long term 30 day experiments were then performed at the optimal conditions identified table s3 summarizes estimated uv doses and dose based rate constants and table s6 lists measured uv intensity uv254 t and sulfite concentration 2 6 water analysis targeted pfas analysis 50 compounds and suspect screening protocols described elsewhere liu et al 2021 were performed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry using authentic reference standards lc qtof ms sciex framingham ma x500r qtof system additional information on pfas analytical methods limits of quantification loq table s2 and general water quality parameter measurements can be found in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater characterization twelve pfass were quantified in the source groundwater including 4 pfcas pfpea pfhxa pfhpa and pfoa 6 pfsas pfprs pfbs pfpes pfhxs pfhps and pfos and 2 pfaa precursors fhxsa and 6 2 fts suspect screening analysis of the groundwater was also conducted but no additional compounds could be confidently identified pfas concentrations in the groundwater source were monitored for 30 days and did not vary significantly as shown in fig s1a and b average concentrations are listed in table 1 concentrations of pfsas were generally higher than pfcas as reported in many historical afff usage sites hu et al 2016 the presence of odd and even chain pfass elevated concentrations of even chain pfsas i e pfhxs pfos and the presence of a fluorotelomer sulfonate detected in the groundwater indicates site contamination from afffs produced by both electrochemical fluorination and telomerization processes moody and field 2000 analysis of general water quality parameters showed no significant variations over the course of the field trial table s4 pfas concentrations did not change following pretreatment by sediment and cation exchange filters data not shown the major effect of pretreatment was the desired removal of ca2 and mg2 by the cation exchange cartridges it is also worth noting that pfas concentrations in the source water at the time of the field trial were appreciably lower than those measured during site selection activities conducted prior to deployment indicating transiency of the pfas source at the site regardless the sensitivity of the lc qtof ms methods allowed for analysis of treatment efficacy despite the low initial pfas concentrations 3 2 high pressure membrane performance 3 2 1 impact of recovery on rejection of pfass initial experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of total system permeate recovery on the rejection of pfass by nf and ro rejection as a function of recovery from 90 to 97 is shown in fig 2 for nf 2a and b and ro 2c and d both membranes were operated at the same conditions 18 8 lmh permeate flux and 6 2 l min reject flowrate and rejection was calculated using the loq concentration when measured pfas concentrations were loq table s2 rejection of pfass by nf calculated using the influent and permeate concentrations at the specified recovery was 95 at all recoveries with the exception of shorter chain pfsas pfbs and pfprs which were rejected between 88 and 93 as recovery was increased to 97 rejection of shorter chain pfass pfprs pfbs pfpea pfhxa by nf decreased fig 2a and b likely due to the increased concentration of pfass and dissolved ionic species in the concentrated feed stream liu et al 2021 however rejection of longer chain pfass was not significantly affected when operating at higher recoveries possibly due to an enhanced sieving effect from foulants such as dissolved organic carbon doc appleman et al 2013 previous work demonstrated the effective rejection of pfass by ro to permeate concentrations loq liu et al 2021 thus to enhance the likelihood of detecting pfass in ro permeate five pfass pfhxa pfoa pfbs pfhxs and pfos were spiked into the groundwater at concentrations of 0 5 μg l each prior to evaluating ro performance even with the elevated feed concentrations observed rejection of all pfass by ro was 99 regardless of permeate recovery demonstrating superior rejection of ro compared to nf fig 2c and d a combination of electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion likely contributes to the overall high rejection of pfass by nf and ro membranes appleman et al 2013 electrostatic repulsion occurs between the negatively charged membrane polymers at groundwater ph 7 3 table s1 and the anionic pfcas pfsas and 6 2 fts because fhxsa is likely neutral at ph 7 3 nguyen et al 2020 due to the sulfonamide headgroup rejection by nf was consistently lower than the anionic analogue pfhxs attributed to the lack of an electrostatic repulsion rejection mechanism for this compound fig 2b the effective rejection of pfass due to size exclusion by nf and ro is consistent with the molecular weights of pfass evaluated in this study 250 500 g mol being higher than the molecular weight cutoff of the nf 180 g mol and ro 100 g mol membranes table s1 increased size exclusion is likely responsible for the higher rejection observed for longer chain pfass by nf although ro was more effective than nf in rejecting pfass ro requires higher operating pressures than nf liu et al 2021 and retains greater concentrations of groundwater constituents measured at 97 permeate recovery such as sodium 3000 mg l compared to 1700 mg l nitrate 370 mg l compared to 4 mg l silica 270 mg l compared to 12 mg l and doc 100 mg l compared to 37 mg l table s5 in the ro concentrate than in the nf concentrate high concentrations of these groundwater constituents can promote more membrane fouling scaling introduce greater concentrate management challenges and inhibit photochemical treatment of pfass in the reject stream for example preventing accumulation of nitrate in the membrane reject much lower concentration in nf reject than ro reject is critical because nitrate is an effective scavenger of eaq cui et al 2020 3 2 2 nf long term performance following the tests described above the nf pilot system was operated to 90 permeate recovery to achieve pfas removal while minimizing potential for membrane fouling to evaluate long term performance of the nf uv sulfite treatment train one treatment cycle was performed in an automated fashion each day for 30 consecutive days one treatment cycle consists of concentrating groundwater to 90 permeate recovery by the nf membrane followed by uv sulfite treatment of the nf reject on 13 of the 30 days samples were collected for analysis to assess performance of the nf and uv sulfite unit processes 30 day treatment performance of uv sulfite is discussed later in section 3 3 4 fig 3 depicts rejection of pfass by the nf membrane over 30 days showing both permeate concentrations open symbols and rejection closed symbols corresponding pfas concentrations in the nf reject stream are shown in fig s1c and d and average concentrations are listed in table 1 rejection of individual pfass was generally consistent over the 30 concentration cycles average rejection varied between 92 and 98 for individual pfass consistent with those shown in fig 2 longer chain pfass were rejected to a higher degree than shorter chain analogues comparison of the nf reject concentrations and the raw groundwater table 1 shows that pfass were concentrated in the byproduct reject stream increasing by a factor consistent with 90 recovery and the measured permeate concentrations fig 3 concentrating pfass to a small volume reject stream is expected to reduce the requirements for uv treatment pfas mass reduction goals a temporary decrease in rejection of pfass was observed around day 6 corresponding to operational error when cation exchange cartridge filter change out was delayed resulting in breakthrough of ca2 and mg2 in the nf feed stream table s4 divalent cationic species such as ca2 and mg2 have been shown to decrease rejection of organic compounds due to reducing negative membrane surface charge or by forming dom ca 2 complexes causing increased membrane fouling lee et al 2005 rejection values observed in the field 92 98 were similar to those reported recently for treatment of a similar groundwater performed in the laboratory liu et al 2021 a small initial increase in membrane permeability as represented by temperature corrected specific flux eq s1 was observed in the first 5 concentration cycles followed by small but continuous decrease in the subsequent 25 concentration cycles fig 4 the small decline in membrane permeability suggests membrane fouling occurred and that longer term operation might benefit from modifying operating conditions such as reducing single pass membrane recovery 9 3 per element reducing total system permeate recovery 90 increasing crossflow velocity 6 2 l min reject flowrate or changing membrane cleaning protocols which consisted only of daily membrane system flushes for 15 min still results show that the nf system can reliably recover 90 permeate while effectively rejecting pfass over an extended period of operation 3 3 uv treatment of pfass in nf reject 3 3 1 general trends and impact of ph on uv sulfite treatment tests were first conducted to optimize uv treatment of pfass that accumulated in the nf reject stream byproduct following 90 permeate recovery a pseudo first order kinetic model was applied to obtain rate constants for individual pfass in all treatment conditions fig 5 shows the effects of ph fig 5a and b photosensitizer identify fig 5c and d and sulfite dose fig 5e and f on the observed rate constants for degradation of individual pfass k obs h 1 a complete listing of rate constants is provided in table s8 and measured residual concentrations at each sampling time are shown in figs s2 4 degradation of pfcas occurred more quickly than pfsas and pfaa precursors under all conditions with no apparent difference being noted for pfcas of different chain lengths fig 5a in contrast rates of degradation observed for pfsas increased with increasing chain length fig 5b observed degradation trends among the different pfass are consistent with earlier reports using laboratory batch reactors and deionized matrix solutions ph 9 5 amended with various pfass and afff mixtures bentel et al 2019 tenorio et al 2020 fhxsa a sulfonamide based pfas degraded at a similar rate as pfhxs fig 5b indicating that the sulfonamide head group both have a 6 c perfluorinated chain does not have significant impact on degradation however the degradation rate constants measured for 6 2 fts which also has a 6 carbon polyfluorinated chain were less than those measured for fhxsa and pfhxs possibly due to the generation of 6 2 fts c c0 1 at early timepoints fig s2d during uv treatment transient generation of 6 2 fts and other pfass during uv based treatment processes in afff impacted waters has been observed in laboratory studies tenorio et al 2020 and attributed to the conversion of 6 2 fts precursors that were not identified using the existing lc qtof ms targeted or suspect screening analysis methods the slower degradation of 6 2 fts compared to pfhxs may also be attributed to the presence of a non fluorinated ch2ch2 group adjacent to the sulfonate headgroup similar to findings in a recent report showing slower degradation of fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas compared to fully fluorinated pfcas bentel et al 2019 the ph of the nf reject prior to uv sulfite treatment had a pronounced effect on degradation of pfass with k obs values for pfcas increasing 6 fold when ph was increased from 9 5 to 11 2 prior to uv treatment the effect for pfos was even more dramatic increasing 12 fold from ph 9 5 to 11 2 previous laboratory scale studies have also observed similar enhancement in reaction rates in alkaline conditions bentel et al 2020 qu et al 2014 although the underlying mechanism is still under investigation bentel et al 2020 attributed the increase in reaction rate of pfcas pfsas were not investigated in alkaline conditions ph 12 to an increase in the probability of a decarboxylation hydroxylation elimination hydrolysis degradation pathway occurring thereby cleaving more c f bonds in the pfas 3 3 2 impact of chemical sensitizer alternative photosensitizers for eaq generation including nitrilotriacetate nta sun et al 2018 and potassium iodide ki qu et al 2010 were compared with sulfite fig 5c and d at equimolar concentrations i e 10 mm compared to uv sulfite degradation of pfcas in uv nta was 1 5 times faster whereas pfsas and pfaa precursors were degraded more slowly using nta than sulfite this finding contrasts with earlier laboratory studies showing faster degradation of pfos in deionized water matrix amended with nta compared to sulfite ph 10 2 mm photosensitizer sun et al 2018 the inconsistencies in treatment may be attributed to interactions between nta and groundwater matrix constituents or differences in operating conditions ph 10 and 2 mm nta sun et al 2018 compared to ph 11 2 and 10 mm nta this study however it is worth noting that uv photolysis of nta produces pungent odors likely as a result of amine or urea byproducts and may pose practical challenges for treatment applications in comparison the major byproduct of sulfite photolysis is sulfate which is ubiquitous in most groundwaters in contrast to sulfite and nta little to no degradation of any of the pfass was observed when ki was used as the photosensitizer in contrast to prior laboratory studies qu et al 2014 2010 the lack of reactivity may be due to enhanced scavenging of eaq by iodide intermediates when applying ki concentrations higher than 0 3 mm qu et al 2010 collectively results support the use of sulfite as the optimal uv sensitizer for pfas treatment in this groundwater 3 3 3 impact of sulfite concentration finally tests evaluated the effects of varying sulfite dose at ph 11 2 a uv only control no sulfite added showed only a small amount of degradation for pfcas after 8 h of irradiation time fig s5 consistent with earlier reports bao et al 2018 guo et al 2019 qu et al 2014 2010 this also shows that eaq generated from photolysis of organic matter zepp et al 1987 did not contribute significantly to pfas degradation increasing sulfite concentration from 5 to 20 mm generally resulted in increased degradation rates fig 5e and f for pfcas degradation rates were similar at 5 and 10 mm sulfite but increased 3 fold when the sulfite concentration increased to 20 mm for pfsas and pfaa precursors degradation rates doubled between 5 mm and 10 mm sulfite but then increased less dramatically 1 5x when sulfite was increased to 20 mm these enhancements in pfas transformation rate are likely the result of an increased rate of eaq formation due to higher sulfite concentrations however at higher sulfite concentrations light absorption begins to plateau resulting in diminishing returns uv254 t 69 8 0 5 5 mm 50 8 3 7 10 mm 34 2 0 3 20 mm in contrast previous bench scale studies have reported either no significant increases in pfas treatment at sulfite concentrations 10 mm tenorio et al 2020 or only slight improvements i e 10 gu et al 2017 the discrepancies may be attributed to the multiple high wattage lamps 4 330 w used in this study that provide more photons to react with the higher sulfite concentrations and generate more eaq for pfas degradation compared to the single low wattage lamps 10 18 w used in the bench scale studies given the fast degradation of pfcas compared to pfsas system operating conditions will generally be dictated by pfsa removal where increased sulfite concentrations 10 mm has limited benefit thus longer term tests were conducted using nf reject adjusted to ph 11 2 and amended with 10 mm sulfite before uv irradiation 3 3 4 uv sulfite long term performance automated uv sulfite treatment of the nf reject generated daily for 30 consecutive days was performed to assess stability of the treatment system degradation trends of pfass by uv sulfite were consistent over 30 days as shown in fig 6 for select pfass and reflected treatment trends observed in validation experiments already discussed fig 5 pfcas were consistently removed within 2 h of treatment regardless of compound chain length and pfsas were degraded according to chain length with pfos being removed within 4 h averaged c c0 values for all pfass shown in fig s6 concentrations listed in table s7 although shorter chain pfsas were more calcitrant mass reductions of shorter chain pfsas were still significant with 75 of pfhxs and 20 of pfbs degraded after 4 h of treatment after 23 h only pfprs and pfbs remain in solution with 50 and 70 respectively degraded in 23 h fig s6 the majority 55 of total quantified pfas mass was removed in the first 2 h of treatment increasing to 76 in 4 h 90 in 8 h and 97 after 23 h fig 7 the consistent treatment of pfass by uv sulfite over 30 days indicates minimal accumulation of foulants on the quartz sleeves and that pretreatment efforts sediment and cation exchange cartridge filters and automated sleeve wiping hourly were effective at sustaining overall system performance concentrations of the sulfite sensitizer were also monitored during uv sulfite treatment a consistent 2 5 mm sulfite loss at the beginning of each reaction was observed table s6 possibly attributed to sulfite reaction with dissolved oxygen present in the nf reject water no effort was made to deoxygenate with gas sparging a common practice in laboratory experiments a separate experiment performed by spiking sulfite into an aliquot of deoxygenated n2 sparged reject water confirmed no oxidation of sulfite by other water matrix constituents although water could be actively deoxygenated by inert gas sparging results suggest that sulfite addition is an efficient strategy for removing dissolved oxygen upon uv irradiation sulfite concentrations decayed slowly following a pseudo first order rate law kobs 0 075 0 027 h 1 r2 0 97 0 02 and decreasing to 1 6 0 7 mm after 23 h of irradiation further work is suggested to optimize dosing schemes to accelerate pfas degradation and or minimize unreacted residuals in the treated water 3 4 electrical costs and treatment outlook results from the 30 day continuous treatment experiments were used to determine energy requirements for the overall hybrid nf uv sulfite treatment process where nf was operated to 90 permeate recovery and the times required to destroy 90 of individual pfass during uv sulfite treatment of the reject water were used to estimate electrical energy per order ee o kwh m3 values for treatment of individual pfass the volume used to calculate ee o was the total volume of water treated 568 l 150 gal fig 8 shows the results of ee o estimates for each of the target pfass considering all electrical draws required for the treatment train including miscellaneous nf and uv associated operations water chilling and scada control detailed energy consumption breakdowns in table s9 differences in ee o estimates between individual target pfass reflect the varying uv sulfite reaction times required to achieve 90 reduction in concentration based on 30 day kobs values table s8 a single ee o value is estimated for pfcas evaluated in this study c5 c8 using a treatment time of 2 h due to rapid degradation of these compounds fig 6 in aggregate required ee o values were similar for pfcas 13 1 kwh m3 and pfos 14 1 kwh m3 energy requirements for treatment then increased with decreasing chain length for pfsas with ee o values roughly doubling for every decrease in cf2 in pfsa carbon chain length reflecting the inertness of these structures to uv sulfite treatment thus while uv sulfite treatment of nf reject concentrates may be viable for pfcas and longer chain pfsas e g pfhxs and longer treatment of the shorter chain pfsas such as pfprs and pfbs would likely be prohibitively energy intensive ee o 100 kwh m3 ee o values for fhxsa and 6 2 fts were much greater than that estimated for pfhxs respectively again reflecting the differences in k obs values measured for these pfass indicating a pre oxidation step may be considered for more cost effective removal of these compounds examining the different contributing factors to the total energy requirements the energy requirements for the nf membrane process was 2 8 kwh m3 to achieve 90 permeate recovery or 20 of the total energy requirements for pfca and pfos ee o nf energy requirements would vary with recovery due to variable treatment times in comparison the uv reactor and associated water cooling needs represent the major contributors to the energy requirements for treatment while water cooling mainly of the uv reactor was a significant source of energy consumption 37 it is possible that most of these inputs could be eliminated in an optimized full scale process where passive cooling could be used as an alternative e g using the much larger nf permeate flow as a coolant stream uv led technologies may also be used to reduce the energy costs associated with treatment as the technology advances and becomes more cost effective than traditional mercury lamps results from a recent laboratory scale uv sulfite study treating 600 ml of water with 18 w lp uv lamp ph 12 and 10 mm sulfite reported an ee o for pfoa of 15 8 kwh m3 bentel et al 2020 which is 2 5 times greater than the 6 44 kwh m3 observed here for the uv sulfite process alone table s9 this suggests that there are efficiencies gained by combining nf and uv sulfite for treatment or by pilot scale reactor configuration results also show that the hybrid nf uv sulfite treatment train compares favorably with ee o values reported recently for other destructive technologies not operated as a treatment train including a pilot scale demonstration of a plasma technology for treatment of pfoa and pfos 16 6 kwh m3 nau hix et al 2021 pilot scale photocatalytic process for treatment of pfoa 51 5 kwh m3 qanbarzadeh et al 2020 and bench scale electrochemical oxidation of pfoa and pfos 5 1 and 6 7 kwh m3 respectively le et al 2019 as discussed previously ee o calculations for this study were based on the total volume of water treated 568 l rather than the concentrated volume of water treated in the uv reactor 57 l indicating that energy costs for pfas degradation are less by the combination of nf and uv sulfite than by uv sulfite itself if ee o values were instead calculated based on volume of water treated by uv only then ee o values for uv treatment would be 10 greater i e 64 4 kwh m3 for pfoa and 71 2 kwh m3 for pfos destruction of pfass remains highly energy intensive when compared with other water treatment operations for context ro seawater desalination requires 2 5 4 kwh m3 zarzo and prats 2018 from an operating perspective the high uv doses required for treatment accumulated 128 000 mj cm2 over 2 h and 282 000 mj cm2 over 4 h for pfca and pfos degradation respectively table s3 indicate significant challenges to utilizing uv sulfite in existing single pass uv disinfection facilities or as a replacement for existing pfas remediation strategies such as continuous flow adsorption based treatment technologies additionally ph adjustment to 11 2 and subsequent neutralization may incur additional operating challenges and costs nevertheless this study demonstrates that both nf and uv sulfite may be more viable pfas treatment technologies when combined high pressure membranes are not frequently used for pfas treatment due to concentrate management challenges uv sulfite treatment and by extension other destructive technologies may leverage the benefits of waste volume reduction to reduce energy requirements for pfas mass destruction operations 4 conclusion this contribution reported on the results of a field demonstration pilot scale hybrid nf uv sulfite treatment train for the separation and destruction of pfass from afff impacted groundwater initial tests showed that high pressure membranes can achieve good rejection 95 of most pfass at high permeate recoveries with performance being sustained throughout a 30 day consecutive field trial pfass were concentrated in the resulting nf reject stream significantly reducing the volume of water requiring further treatment pfas destruction was accomplished by uv treatment after amending the nf reject with sulfite photosensitizer to generate eaq and adjusting to alkaline ph conditions ph 11 2 rates of destruction observed for individual pfass were consistent with trends reported in small scale laboratory studies with pfcas and longer chain pfsas being readily degraded while shorter chain pfsas and 6 2 fts were degraded much more slowly sulfite proved to be a preferable sensitizer to nta and ki and treatment at lower ph conditions was less effective analysis of electrical energy inputs showed that the hybrid nf uv sulfite process was competitive with other technologies for pfas destruction the uv treatment step and associated cooling requirements dominated energy inputs which varied for different pfass work aimed at optimizing passive cooling systems is recommended to further reduce energy requirements for pfas remediation with this and related technologies declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare

16581,sars cov 2 transmission remains a global problem which exerts a significant direct cost to public health additionally other aspects of physical and mental health can be affected by limited access to social and exercise venues as a result of lockdowns in the community or personal reluctance due to safety concerns swimming pools reopened in the uk on april 12th 2021 but the effect of swimming pool water on inactivation of sars cov 2 has not yet been directly demonstrated here we demonstrate that chlorinated water which adheres to uk swimming pool guidelines is sufficient to reduce sars cov 2 infectious titre by at least 3 orders of magnitude graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 coronavirus chlorine swimming pools water inactivation 1 introduction sars

faeces wang et al 2005 chlorine is often used to disinfect water as it has broad activity against human pathogens cdc 2012 and it has been demonstrated that a residual free chlorine level of 0 5 mg l 1 results in complete inactivation of sars cov over the 30 min timeframe tested wang et al 2005 while efforts have been made to use in vitro results to model the potential risk of faecal oral transmission through global water systems shutler et al 2021 the survival of sars cov 2 specifically in chlorinated swimming pools has not yet been investigated outbreaks of respiratory viruses such as adenoviruses and enteric viruses such as enteroviruses hepatitis a and noroviruses which can transmit by the faecal oral route are sometimes linked to swimming pools but this is often due to improper maintenance of chlorine levels bonadonna and la rosa 2019 2000 in the uk between june 2020 and july 2021 most commercial pools adhered to guidelines for treatment with a chlorine based disinfectant to maintain a free chlorine level of 1 5 3 mg l 1 or parts per million ppm with a ph range of 7 0 7 6 as the availability of active free chlorine decreases with increasing ph 2020 since the removal of lockdown measures in the uk these guidelines have been revised to include a free chlorine level of 2 0 ppm when the ph is between 7 2 and 7 4 2021 here by treating sars cov 2 with swimming pool water which conforms to uk guidelines we demonstrate at least a 3 log10 reduction in infectious titre 2 results 2 1 generating sars cov 2 virus stocks suitable for inactivation testing virus stocks of sars cov 2 for use in infectivity assays are generally generated by infection of a permissive cell line such as vero and harvesting of virus in highly buffered cell culture medium however we observed in preliminary experiments that when testing the chlorine levels in water samples before and after adding a 1 1000 vol of buffered cell culture medium free chlorine levels fell below the limit of detection of the equipment used in contrast adding a 1 100 vol of an unbuffered saline solution resulted in a negligible drop in free chlorine levels in the water sample the buffering capacity of the virus stock itself in cell culture medium would make it difficult to observe inactivation at the desired free chlorine and ph levels during testing to overcome this issue we generated a stock of sars cov 2 virus in unbuffered solution by infecting caco 2 and vero cells with a sars cov 2 b1 lineage virus at a multiplicity of 0 01 plaque forming units pfu cell 1 extensively washing off and replacing the growth medium with saline solution 24 h before harvest at 3 days post infection we were able to generate stocks of infectious virus with reduced buffering capacity to further minimise the effect of the non viral constituents of the stock such as cellular components which would exert a chlorine demand on the water samples tested a 1 100 dilution of virus in normal saline was used in all inactivation tests 2 2 inactivation of sars cov 2 by chlorinated water water was collected from swimming pools in volumes of up to 1 litre and transported to the laboratory on the same day the water was tested for free chlorine and ph levels onsite and upon arrival at the laboratory and adjusted to a range of values a 10 µl volume of the sars cov 2 virus stock generated in caco 2 cells was then added to duplicate water samples in a total volume of 1 ml 1 100 dilution of virus stock incubated for 30 s at room temperature before quenching the chlorine with a one tenth volume of 10x cell culture medium residual virus infectivity in the samples was then titrated on vero cells by tcid50 assay commonly used to measure survival of viruses after treatment chin et al 2020 gundy et al 2009 payment and trudel 1979 in each experiment the same virus stock was incubated for 30 s at a 1 100 dilution in pbs as a control firstly the effect of a range of increasing free chlorine levels in water starting at the minimum 1 5 ppm recommended in uk swimming pools until july 2021 were tested fig 1 a a low ph of approximately ph 7 0 was used to give the best chance of observing virus inactivation as availability of free chlorine is maximized at lower ph under these conditions no detectable virus infectivity remained after 30 s demonstrating at least a 3 log10 reduction in infectious titre compared to the pbs control where approximately 1 104 tcid50 ml 1 of virus was measured fig 1a we next measured residual sars cov 2 infectivity in conditions with higher ph while keeping the free chlorine level at approximately 1 5 ppm inactivation was observed to undetectable levels in all conditions except at the elevated ph of 7 62 at which low levels of virus infectivity were still observed at the threshold of detection of the assay this inactivation equated to 3 log10 decreased infectivity compared to the control fig 1b to demonstrate the interaction between the variables of ph and free chlorine in causing inactivation of sars cov 2 infectivity swimming pool water samples either at 1 42 1 72 ppm or below 0 52 0 61 ppm the uk recommended free chlorine levels were modified to phs of approximately 7 7 5 and 8 this resulted in only partial inactivation of the virus infectivity and revealed the importance of both chlorine levels and ph to achieve inactivation fig 1c finally we generated a further stock of the sars cov 2 lineage b 1 virus in unbuffered saline in vero cells and tested it against water at 3 ph levels at chlorine levels of 1 56 1 68 ppm the new stock had a lower titre resulting in a yield of 1 103 tcid50 ml 1 from the pbs control condition nonetheless full inactivation equating to a greater than 2 log10 drop in infectivity was observed at ph 7 00 and ph 7 45 and even at ph 7 80 the infectivity was decreased more than 50 fold fig 1d 3 conclusion swimming pools have reopened in the uk as of april 12th 2021 and therefore present locations of possible covid 19 transmission the likelihood of transmission events occurring in shared areas such as changing rooms can be minimised with social distancing and hygiene measures around the pool but different variables affect any risk associated with time spent in the water chlorination of swimming pool water has been used for decades to mitigate any onwards transmission of pathogens between swimmers however since the causative agent of covid 19 the betacoronavirus named sars cov 2 only emerged in late 2019 inactivation of sars cov 2 by chlorinated water has not yet been directly demonstrated prior to this study since viruses cannot replicate outside of a host a transmission event via swimming pool water would require that virus emitted directly from a bather reached another at a sufficient infectious dose firstly emitted virus will be greatly diluted before this occurs potentially below a minimal infectious dose in addition if chlorinated water is directly viricidal against sars cov 2 the likelihood of infectious virus being transmitted in swimming pool water will be further lowered demonstrating this may be important in increasing public confidence in returning to pools here we demonstrate that inactivation of sars cov 2 in chlorinated swimming pool water is dependant on free chlorine and ph levels with increased inactivation at higher free chlorine and lower ph we show that 30 s contact time at room temperature with water of a ph of no more than 7 4 and free chlorine above 1 5 mg l 1 ppm resulted in at least a 3 log10 reduction in viral titre within 30 s fig 1 these levels are within the recommendations for swimming pools from june 2021 to july 2021 of the pandemic in the uk of at least 1 5 ppm free chlorine at ph 7 0 2 0 ppm at ph 7 4 and 2 7 ppm at ph 7 6 2020 the newly revised uk guidelines that swimming pools at ph 7 2 7 4 should have a minimum free chlorine level of 2 0 ppm is also supported by our observation that 1 5 ppm is adequate at ph 7 4 2021 we found here that some residual virus was detected after treatment with water above ph 7 4 even when at least 1 5 ppm free chlorine was present a limitation of this study is that we did not test survival of sars cov 2 contained within mucus or saliva mixed with swimming pool water also sars cov 2 has been demonstrated to be heat labile with rapid inactivation above 65 c and prolonged survivability at 4 c showing the importance of water temperature in assessing inactivation and the risk presented by water systems abraham et al 2020 chin et al 2020 shutler et al 2021 it is recommended that pools in the uk are kept at 26 c 32 c 2021 and while we did not measure or determine the effect of temperature in this study our pool water samples at the time of testing would be at this temperature or have decreased to closer to ambient temperature particularly in the small volumes used however it is possible that pools below 26 c would permit survival of sars cov 2 at the chlorine and ph levels we tested further we were only able to test reduction of a virus stock with starting infectivity around 1 104 tcid50 ml 1 due to the limited replication of sars cov 2 in the laboratory and the need to use a minimal volume of virus material during testing nonetheless this viral challenge of 1 104 infectious particles equates to approximately 5 107 total virus particles as measured by rt qpcr to detect virus genomes this corresponds to a cycle threshold ct value of 21 which is greatly in excess of the viral load typically detected in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic people with an average ct of 31 15 ra et al 2021 the route by which any residual virus in swimming pool water might infect another swimmer is not clear sars cov 2 is transmitted in the air and also by direct inoculation there is also a potential faecal oral route of transmission for sars cov 2 cahill and morris 2020 guo et al 2021 our findings on the susceptibility of sars cov 2 to inactivation by swimming pool water underscore the importance for those who maintain swimming pools to adhere to uk guidelines for chlorination and this should give confidence in the safety of bathers when in the water finally we stress that swimmers should continue to adhere to locally recommended social distancing rules both in and out of the water

16582,ferrate vi fe vi can oxidize individual pollutants but the pollutant oxidation does not necessarily result in toxicity reduction besides fe vi resultant fe iii particles has previously been used to remove heavy metals but its influence on organic matter and toxicity of wastewater is unknown this study investigated influence of fe vi on the cytotoxicity and dna double strand break dsb effects of secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants to chinese hamster ovary cells adding 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe reduced the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of secondary effluents by 44 71 and 40 59 respectively the toxicity reduction could be explained by the alleviation of oxidative stress in cells when they were exposed to the fe vi treated organic matter oxidation and coagulation accounted for 60 and 40 of the reductions in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity demonstrating that both oxidation and coagulation processes can play important roles in reducing toxicity molecular weight mw distribution analysis showed that the oxidation process was favored for removing ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence intensity of organic matter while the coagulation process removed more dissolved organic carbon doc especially the doc of fractions with mw 500 da compared with ferric chloride the fe vi resultant fe iii showed better coagulation performance on organic matter cytotoxicity and genotoxicity removal because of the different particle sizes and crystalline structures this study highlights the benefit of using fe vi in advanced treatment as fe vi reduced the overall toxicity of secondary effluents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater ferrate vi oxidation coagulation cytotoxicity dna double strand breaks 1 introduction wastewater reuse is important to alleviate the global water shortage chen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 but there might be many toxic pollutants in secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps du et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 shang et al 2020 2021 tiwari et al 2017 yang et al 2018b moreover the coexistence of various pollutants in secondary effluents may create greater toxic effects than the individual pollutants alone because of additive or synergistic effects lau et al 2020 toxicity assays based on mammalian cells have indicated that secondary effluents have cytotoxicity and genotoxicity dong et al 2017 2019b le roux et al 2017 secondary effluents can even result in dna double strand breaks dsbs in mammalian cells du et al 2020 wu et al 2019 which are the most dangerous type of damage that occurs in the genome of eukaryotic cells and are involved in the process of cancers and other diseases bassing and alt 2004 suggesting a potential risk if humans are exposed to the secondary effluents to guarantee the safety of wwtp effluents advanced treatment is therefore needed to further purify the water and reduce the toxicity ferrate fe vi as a green wastewater treatment reagent has drawn great interest rai et al 2018 talaiekhozani et al 2017 fe vi can inactivate microbes nguema and jun 2016 remove heavy metals dong et al 2019a and degrade micro pollutants such as tetrabromobisphenol a simvastatin and triclosan han et al 2018 patibandla et al 2018 yang et al 2011 in addition the final decomposition product of fe vi is ferric fe iii which is a widely used coagulant sharma et al 2016 the ability of fe vi to remove pollutants is first derived from its strong oxidation ability the redox potentials of fe vi range from 2 20 acidic conditions to 0 72 v alkaline conditions han et al 2013 wood 1958 during oxidation fe vi is first reduced to fe v fe iv via electron transfer mechanisms depending on the organic compounds being oxidized lee et al 2014 peng et al 2020 shao et al 2019 sharma 2010 the intermediates fe v fe iv are further transformed to the final product fe iii sharma 2011 although fe vi can remove various individual organic pollutants the oxidation of pollutants does not necessarily equate to toxicity reduction the transformation products of organic pollutants during oxidation processes like ozonation and ultraviolet irradiation can be more toxic rehman et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and this toxicity increase can also occur with fe vi oxidation after being oxidized by fe vi the products of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed negligible toxicity toward bacteria yang et al 2016 while the toxicity of products of imidacloprid and azithromycin toward luminescent bacteria was significantly increased zhang and jiang 2021 such contrary observations for different pollutants indicate that overall toxicity evaluations of the whole effluent are required unfortunately to date very few studies have investigated the toxicity changes in real wastewater especially the cytotoxicity and dna dsb effects in mammalian cells after fe vi treatment the final decomposition product fe iii of fe vi can further purify water as fe iii is a commonly used coagulant fe vi resultant fe iii has been reported to effectively remove phosphate arsenic antimony thallium and selenium from water lan et al 2016 liu et al 2017 xu and fu 2020 however coagulation with fe vi resultant fe iii has been mainly reported to remove inorganic nutrients and heavy metals lv et al 2018 and little attention has been paid to its use in the organic matter removal and toxicity reduction oxidation process usually transforms pollutants to oxidation products there is a possibility that fe vi resultant fe iii further removes the oxidation products and non oxidized pollutants thus reducing the toxicity of wastewater in depth the commercial fe iii such as ferric chloride and ferric sulfate is inefficient in removing the organic pollutants in water golbaz et al 2014 selcuk et al 2011 yang et al 2018a yet the coagulation performance of fe vi resultant fe iii remains unclear hindering the understanding of fe vi application in wastewater treatment therefore the purpose of this study was to understand the influences of fe vi on the cytotoxicity and dna dsb effects of secondary effluents and to clarify the contributions of oxidation and coagulation to the toxicity changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents chemicals and reagents used in this study are detailed in the supporting information si text s1 2 2 water sampling and analysis secondary effluents were sampled at the outlet of the anaerobic anoxic oxic process from municipal wwtps serving different areas in shenzhen china labeled as se1 se2 se3 and se4 each sample was filtered with a 0 45 μm filter and refrigerated at 4 c before further experiments the methods for water quality parameter measurement such as dissolved organic carbon doc ph ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem are detailed in text s2 the water quality parameters of water samples are shown in table s1 2 3 fe vi preparation and measurement potassium ferrate k2feo4 90 was prepared by ourself according to the wet chemical synthesis method delaude and laszlo 1996 yang et al 2016 immediately before use the prepared fe vi was dissolved in pre cooled 4 c ultra pure water containing 1 mm nahco3 ph 9 2 as a stock solution of fe vi yang et al 2018a the fe vi stock solution around 1 g fe l was filtered by a 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone syringe filter then the concentration was measured at 510 nm using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer ε510 nm 1150 m 1 cm 1 rush and bielski 1986 the 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts method was used to measure the concentration of residual fe vi in the water samples lee et al 2014 2 4 sample preparation the stock solution of fe vi was dosed into 4 l water samples buffered with 20 mm borate solution ph 7 the samples were stirred for 10 min 300 r min and then stood for 20 min both the oxidation and coagulation processes occurred during this time no residual fe vi was detected at the end of reaction then the 4 l samples were divided into two aliquots and each aliquot 2 l was centrifuged 4800 r min 5 min the supernatants of one aliquot were collected which were considered as the secondary effluent se that was treated by both oxidation and coagulation labelled as seoxi coag the flocs were collected and redissolved in 2000 ml of ultrapure water acidified to ph 2 with h2so4 2 m for further analysis and toxicity assay which were regarded as the organic matter removed by coagulation labelled as sefloc because the oxidation and coagulation processes occurred simultaneously the organic matter in the flocs can contain the non oxidized pollutants in se and oxidation products by fe vi the other centrifuged aliquot was adjusted to ph 2 in situ with h2so4 2 m to redissolve the floc which was considered as the secondary effluent samples that were treated by oxidation alone labelled as seoxi to verify that this separation and preparation process would not result in toxicity loss samples seoxi coag and sefloc were mixed again the toxicity in the mixed samples should be equal to the toxicity of seoxi if there was no toxicity loss it should be noted that samples only underwent in situ coagulation by fe vi were unavailable because oxidation inevitably occurs therefore an ex situ coagulation experiment was performed the fe vi stock solution was spiked into ultrapure water and left to self decompose at ph 7 for at least 1 h until no residual fe vi was detected to obtain fe iii particles yang et al 2018a the fe vi resultant fe iii particles and commercial ferric chloride were individually added to the secondary effluent samples buffered by 20 mm borate ph 7 for the coagulation experiment the samples were stirred for 10 min 300 r min and left standing for 20 min then the solution was centrifuged 4800 r min 5 min the supernatant secoag was collected for further analysis and toxicity assay 2 5 pretreatment for toxicity assays solid phase extraction spe was used as pre treatment for the toxicity assays the method is detailed elsewhere wu et al 2020 briefly samples including the supernatant and redissolved floc were adjusted to ph 2 with 2 m h2so4 and passed through the extraction cartridges oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance waters usa methanol acetone and dichloromethane were used in sequence to elute the adsorbed organic matter the eluents were dried using a nitrogen flow and dissolved in culture medium for toxicity assays the doc recovery by spe was around 80 it should be noted that although spe cannot retain inorganic pollutants the municipal wastewater used in this study should contain few heavy metals 2 6 analysis of molecular weight distribution to understand the molecular weight distribution of organic matter from multiple aspects of uv fluorescence flu and doc a high performance size exclusion chromatography lc20 shimadzu japan equipped with tandem uv array

the particles formed during coagulation using an in situ x ray photoelectron spectrometer phi 5000 versa probe ii ulvac phi japan with a monochromatic al kα x ray source the pass energy was 58 70 ev and the step size was 0 125 ev a fe2o3 standard and a feooh standard were also measured as references 2 12 statistical analysis for the cytotoxicity assay the concentration effect curves were fitted by regression analysis with the cell viability at different sample concentrations using the four parameter equation according to a previous study yang and zhang 2013 then the concentration at 50 cell viability namely the lc50 value was used to calculate the cytotoxicity equivalents mg phenol l for dna dsbs the concentration effect curves were fitted by regression analysis using the induction rate ir of ph2ax foci at different sample concentrations with cell viabilities of 70 plewa et al 2010 the sample concentration at which the ph2ax induction rate was 1 5 50 increase against the negative control defined as the ir1 5 was used to calculate the genotoxicity equivalents μg 4 nqo l details of the toxicity equivalent calculation are presented in the text s3 one way analysis of variance anova was applied to decide the significant toxicity difference between the samples and the negative control p 0 05 if so holm sidak multiple comparisons versus the negative control were performed to determine the lowest concentration that produced toxic effects with the power of the test statistic 1 β being 0 8 at α 0 05 wagner and plewa 2017 for toxicity equivalents one way anova was also used to determine significant differences p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reduction by fe vi concentration effect curves of the cytotoxicity assays for each secondary effluent sample se1 se2 se3 and se4 from different wwtps are shown in figs 1 a and s1 all the water samples showed cytotoxicity suggesting the need for advanced treatment to further purify the secondary effluents different doses of fe vi were added to the four samples the lc50 values of all the four samples increased with increasing fe vi doses indicating decreased cytotoxicity as shown in fig 1b the cytotoxicity equivalents of the four secondary effluents ranged from 3 6 to 10 3 mg phenol l with the lc50 values being 71 103 folds concentration which were comparable to the toxicities reported in previous studies dong et al 2017 massalha et al 2018 wu et al 2019 suggesting the representativeness of the samples used in this study adding 0 5 mg l fe vi as fe can significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of the four samples p 0 05 with increasing doses of fe vi the cytotoxicity was further reduced when 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe was added the cytotoxicity of the treated samples was decreased to 1 9 3 6 mg phenol l with a reduction of 44 71 because compositions and properties of organic micropollutants in water samples investigated in this study were different during fe vi treatment the degradability of organic micropollutants and their transformation products could also vary a lot which led to the different observed toxicity removal the concentration response curves of the genotoxicity assays are shown in figs 1c and s2 genotoxicity was also decreased after addition of fe vi the genotoxicity equivalents of the secondary effluents were 3 0 4 8 µg 4 nqo l and were significantly reduced by 15 31 when 0 5 mg l fe vi as fe was added p 0 05 fig 1d adding 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe further reduced the genotoxicity equivalents by 40 59 the dna dsbs measured as the genotoxicity endpoint are the most severe case of dna damage which can activate oncogenes and cause organisms to be susceptible to cancers and many other diseases khanna 2015 both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays suggested that fe vi can effectively purify secondary effluents and improve the water quality the observed cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reduction should be because of fe vi removing toxic organic matter in the secondary effluents fe vi can reduce the toxicity of some individual organic pollutants for example propyl paraben can be oxidized by fe vi toxicities of the oxidation products of propyl paraben toward green algae daphnia and fish as calculated by the ecosar program was significantly decreased an et al 2018 sulfonamides can be oxidized by fe vi and cytotoxicity assays using human embryonic kidney cells and monocyte macrophages indicated that the transformation products showed a lower toxicity than the sulfonamides acosta rangel et al 2020 enrofloxacin has been also found to be degraded effectively by fe vi and the toxicity of the degradation products to vibrio qinghaiensis was removed significantly shao et al 2020 however analysis of limited individual compounds might not characterize the toxicity changes in the overall wastewater our study indicated for the first time that fe vi can effectively remove the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity toward mammalian cells of the pollutant mixtures extracted from secondary effluents the widely used ozonation has been shown to increase cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of secondary effluents due to formation of oxidation byproducts dong et al 2017 wu et al 2019 therefore biofiltration is typically recommended after ozonation to remove toxic oxidation byproducts it is interesting that toxicity increase was not observed for fe vi suggesting fe vi is promising in wastewater treatment the byproduct formation during ozonation such as aldehydes bromate and organic bromine have been well understood wu et al 2021 more insights into the byproduct formation during fe vi treatment is needed in the future 3 2 alleviation of intracellular oxidative stress by fe vi pollutants in wastewater can increase the ros levels in mammalian cells leading to excessive oxidative stress which can cause irreversible oxidative damage to biomacromolecules pals et al 2013 in addition excessive ros have been found to cause cytotoxicity and dna damage du et al 2020 we therefore investigated the changes in the ros levels when cells were exposed to fe vi treated secondary effluents compared with the negative control intracellular ros levels were significantly elevated when exposing cells to the spe extracts of the secondary effluent fig 2 a when the secondary effluent was treated by fe vi an obvious right shift was observed in the concentration effect curves i e intracellular oxidative stress was alleviated because ros are partly responsible for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity pals et al 2013 the decreased levels of intracellular ros could explain the detoxification effect of fe vi on secondary effluents to further verify that fe vi treatment alleviates the intracellular oxidative stress caused by secondary effluents the dna rna oxidative markers 8 hydroxy deoxyguanosine 8 ohdg 8 hydroxy guanosine 8 ohg labelled as 8 oh d g were also measured 8 oh d g is formed via hydroxy radicals attacking deoxyguanosine dna and guanosine rna at the c 8 position of guanine ng et al 2017 fig 2b shows the significantly increased 8 oh d g when exposing cells to the spe extracts p 0 05 fe vi treated secondary effluent induced the production of less 8 oh d g confirming the alleviated oxidative stress in the cells 8 ohdg as a biomarker of cancers is considered to be responsible for the initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis kryston et al 2011 8 ohg can disturb the normal expression of proteins chen and zhong 2013 these results again emphasized that fe vi is beneficial for improving water quality 3 3 contributions of oxidation and coagulation to toxicity removal both oxidation and coagulation processes occur during water treatment using fe vi to distinguish between the roles of oxidation and coagulation in removing toxicity secondary effluent se samples that underwent only oxidation seoxi underwent both oxidation and coagulation seoxi coag and the coagulation resultant flocs sefloc were prepared see materials and methods section the concentration effect curves of the mixtures of seoxi coag and sefloc were similar to those of seoxi figs s3 and s4 and the differences in the toxicities were not statistically significant p 0 05 tables s2 and s3 indicating the floc collection and redissolution process did not result in toxicity loss here toxicity removed by only the oxidation process was defined as the difference in the toxicity equivalents of se and seoxi toxicity removed by the coagulation process was defined as the difference in the toxicity equivalents of seoxi and seoxi coag the concentration response curves are presented in fig 3 a and c 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe see concentration response curves of 0 5 and 2 0 mg l fe vi in figs s5 and s6 the toxicity equivalents removed by oxidation and coagulation are presented in fig 3b and d when the samples were dosed with 0 5 mg l fe vi as fe the toxicity was mainly reduced by oxidation with cytotoxicity being decreased by 1 4 mg phenol l and genotoxicity being decreased by 0 9 μg 4 nqo l increasing the fe vi dose did not appreciably increase the decrease in toxicity caused by oxidation when the samples were dosed with 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe the removal of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by oxidation was slightly increased to 1 6 mg phenol l and 1 2 μg 4 nqo l respectively coagulation only decreased the cytotoxicity by 0 1 mg phenol l and the genotoxicity by 0 1 μg 4 nqo l when 0 5 mg l fe vi as fe was added however it is interesting that increasing the fe vi dose dramatically enhanced the reduction in toxicity by coagulation when increasing the fe vi dose to 5 0 mg l as fe the reductions in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by coagulation were increased by a large margin to 1 2 mg phenol l and 0 8 μg 4 nqo l this might be due to the increased formation of fe iii particles therefore it could be concluded that both oxidation and coagulation processes contributed to reducing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the secondary effluent when dosing 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe oxidation accounted for approximately 60 and coagulation accounted for approximately 40 of the decreases in both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity the toxicity reduction by oxidation could be because the oxidation products formed are less toxic than the original organic compounds the products of many organic compounds oxidized by fe vi including the oxidation products of sulfonamides sulfachloropyridazine propyl paraben ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin have been demonstrated to be less toxic than the original compounds shao et al 2020 however previously coagulation by fe vi resultant fe iii has been mainly considered to be responsible for the removal of turbidity inorganic nutrients like phosphate and heavy metals shao et al 2019 very few studies have found that coagulation is effective in removing organic compounds such as p arsanilic acid by using fe vi yang et al 2018a our results found for the first time that when using fe vi for wastewater treatment the coagulation process is also very important for reducing the toxicity caused by organic matter 3 4 influence of fe vi on organic matter in secondary effluent during fe vi treatment the toxicity reduction was because of the transformation and removal of organic matter the doc uv254 feem and molecular weight mw distributions were measured to understand the changes in the organic matter in secondary effluents after adding fe vi fe vi had a limited impact on doc removal but effectively reduced the uv254 value indicating that fe vi effectively removed unsaturated bonds in the organic matter fig s7 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 fig s8 shows the fluorescence spectra of secondary effluent treated by fe vi the fluorescence intensities of all regions decreased with increasing fe vi doses indicating fe vi also degraded the fluorophores of organic matter chen et al 2003 fig 4 a shows chromatograms of the mw distribution when the secondary effluent underwent both oxidation and coagulation processes after adding fe vi the chromatograms were further de convoluted into gaussian peaks wang et al 2017a being divided into four fractions according to the apparent mw including f1 100 da f2 100 500 da f3 500 1000 da and f4 1000 da the fraction with a mw between 100 and 500 da f2 is most abundant in the secondary effluent fig 4b the mw based results show that fe vi did not remove much doc but dramatically reduced the flu intensity and uv254 absorbance especially the flu intensity and uv254 absorbance of f2 100 500 da to further distinguish between the roles of oxidation and coagulation in organic matter removal by fe vi the mw distributions of se seoxi seoxi coag and sefloc were characterized fig 4c and d shows the chromatograms and the intensity of each fraction here we define the signal intensity difference between se and seoxi coag as the total removal the signal intensity difference between se and seoxi was contributed by oxidation while the difference between seoxi and seoxi coag was contributed by coagulation by comparing the mw compositions of se seoxi and seoxi coag oxidation was found to be mainly responsible for the removal in the flu intensity and uv254 absorbance but not the doc concentrations 94 flu removal and 89 uv254 removal were resulted from oxidation this result is because the oxidation process is generally difficult to mineralize the organic matter but tends to destroy unsaturated chromophores and fluorophores huang et al 2019 unlike for oxidation by comparing the mw compositions of seoxi and seoxi coag although coagulation barely changed the flu intensity and uv254 absorbance it removed more doc contributing 92 to the doc removal especially the doc in f1 100 da and f2 100 500 da fig 4d as mentioned above a previous study found fe vi resultant fe iii can remove organic micropollutants such as p arsanilic acid through coagulation yang et al 2018a while the mw of p arsanilic acid 217 da is in the range of 100 500 da in conclusion during fe vi treatment oxidation and coagulation are complementary in organic matter removal oxidation tends to transform organic matter in the secondary effluent while coagulation may remove the transformed non transformed organic matter these results supported the observation that both oxidation and coagulation are conductive to decreasing the organic matter caused toxicity 3 5 toxicity removal by fe vi resultant fe iii and ferric chloride the coagulation performance would result from the fe iii particles from fe vi decomposition which partly removed organic matter and toxicity however previous studies have found that the commonly used coagulants containing fe iii such as ferric chloride and ferric sulfate showed poor performance in the removal of individual organic contaminants golbaz et al 2014 selcuk et al 2011 yang et al 2018a we therefore compared the coagulation effects of fe vi resultant fe iii and ferric chloride on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reduction ferric chloride 5 0 mg l of fe did not decrease the cytotoxicity of secondary effluent p 0 05 while fe vi resultant fe iii reduced the cytotoxicity by 19 which contributed 32 of the total cytotoxicity reduction by fe vi fig 5 a and b the genotoxicity assay showed similar results fig 5c and d fe vi resultant fe iii reduced the genotoxicity by 24 and contributed 52 of the total genotoxicity reduction by fe vi while ferric chloride did not significantly reduce the genotoxicity p 0 05 the different coagulation abilities for toxicity reduction between fe vi resultant fe iii and ferric chloride can be partly explained by the removed organic matter the mw distributions of organic matter in the flocs from coagulation were characterized by the doc fig 5e and f shows the chromatograms and the intensity of each fraction in the flocs namely the organic matter removed by coagulation the fe vi resultant fe iii removed more doc from the secondary effluent than did ferric chloride fig 5f suggesting a better coagulation ability for the fe vi resultant fe iii in addition the fe vi resultant fe iii mainly removed organic matter with a mw below 500 da f1 and f2 fig 5e compared with the fe vi resultant fe iii ferric chloride removed more high mw fractions 1000 da and less low mw fractions 100 da fig 5f generally the toxicity of wastewater is caused more by low mw fractions than high mw fractions hu et al 2016 yang et al 2014 which explains the better toxicity reduction by fe vi resultant fe iii compared with ferric chloride to further understand the different effects on organic matter removal and toxicity reduction the flocs from coagulation were analyzed by a hr tem compared with the flocs from ferric chloride coagulation the flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii were surrounded by amorphous substances fig s9a and b which might be the adsorbed organic matter in addition the flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii and ferric chloride had much different size distributions fig s9c and d many flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii had particle sizes less than 20 nm with an average size of 22 4 nm and a median size of 22 0 nm no flocs from ferric chloride had a size less than 20 nm and the average size and median size were 30 7 and 29 9 nm it is known that during nanoparticle formation foreign substances entering the crystal structure can inhibit the nanoparticle growth resulting in smaller nanoparticles cornell and schwertmann 2003 prucek et al 2013 the larger external surface area because of the smaller size will in turn cause higher adsorption capacity and result in more organic matter removal elmorsy et al 2019 goodwill et al 2015 lv et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in addition xps was used to analyze the oxidation state and iron speciation of the flocs from the spectra of fe 2p3 2 flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii showed a peak at a binding energy of 710 3 ev near to the peak of the fe2o3 standard 710 8 ev while the spectra of flocs from ferric chloride were more similar to the feooh standard 708 6 ev fig s9e these results were also observed in the spectra of o 1 s fig s9f and were in agreement with a previous study goodwill et al 2015 during coagulation ferric chloride forms particles through hydrolysis and precipitation goodwill et al 2015 while flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii do not extensively hydrolyze and directly yield nanoparticles that have a fe2o3 core nanoarchitecture prucek et al 2013 these different crystalline structures may be also responsible for the different observed organic matter removal and toxicity reduction as the surface coordination geometry would influence the reactivity of fe iii hydr oxides towards pollutants stumm 1992 4 conclusions this study promoted the understanding of the use of fe vi in wastewater treatment finding that fe vi is beneficial for water safety as it lowers the overall toxicity fe vi can effectively reduce the cytotoxicity and dna dsbs effects in mammalian cells of the pollutant mixtures extracted from wwtp secondary effluents when 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe was added the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity can be removed by 44 71 and 40 59 the toxicity was reduced because fe vi alleviated the pollutant induced oxidative stress in cells the oxidation and coagulation processes that occurred after fe vi addition were complementary for organic matter removal the oxidation process was favorable for the transformation of organic matter with unsaturated bonds but barely mineralized the organic matter while the coagulation process tended to remove the doc therefore both oxidation and coagulation can play important roles in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reduction when adding 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe oxidation and coagulation accounted for 60 and 40 of the reductions in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in the process of coagulation compared with the traditional widely used coagulant ferric chloride fe vi resultant fe iii showed better performance for the removal of organic matter and reduction of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity because of the particular particle sizes and crystalline structure therefore this study would also broaden the scope of fe vi application because in addition to heavy metals fe vi resultant fe iii is also effective in organic matter and toxicity removal declaration of competing

16582,ferrate vi fe vi can oxidize individual pollutants but the pollutant oxidation does not necessarily result in toxicity reduction besides fe vi resultant fe iii particles has previously been used to remove heavy metals but its influence on organic matter and toxicity of wastewater is unknown this study investigated influence of fe vi on the cytotoxicity and dna double strand break dsb effects of secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants to chinese hamster ovary cells adding 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe reduced the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of secondary effluents by 44 71 and 40 59 respectively the toxicity reduction could be explained by the alleviation of oxidative stress in cells when they were exposed to the fe vi treated organic matter oxidation and coagulation accounted for 60 and 40 of the reductions in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity demonstrating that both oxidation and coagulation processes can play important roles in reducing toxicity molecular weight mw distribution analysis showed that the oxidation process was favored for removing ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence intensity of organic matter while the coagulation process removed more dissolved organic carbon doc especially the doc of fractions with mw 500 da compared with ferric chloride the fe vi resultant fe iii showed better coagulation performance on organic matter cytotoxicity and genotoxicity removal because of the different particle sizes and crystalline structures this study highlights the benefit of using fe vi in advanced treatment as fe vi reduced the overall toxicity of secondary effluents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater ferrate vi oxidation coagulation cytotoxicity dna double strand breaks 1 introduction wastewater reuse is important to alleviate the global water shortage chen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 but there might be many toxic pollutants in secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps du et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 qin et al 2020 shang et al 2020 2021 tiwari et al 2017 yang et al 2018b moreover the coexistence of various pollutants in secondary effluents may create greater toxic effects than the individual pollutants alone because of additive or synergistic effects lau et al 2020 toxicity assays based on mammalian cells have indicated that secondary effluents have cytotoxicity and genotoxicity dong et al 2017 2019b le roux et al 2017 secondary effluents can even result in dna double strand breaks dsbs in mammalian cells du et al 2020 wu et al 2019 which are the most dangerous type of damage that occurs in the genome of eukaryotic cells and are involved in the process of cancers and other diseases bassing and alt 2004 suggesting a potential risk if humans are exposed to the secondary effluents to guarantee the safety of wwtp effluents advanced treatment is therefore needed to further purify the water and reduce the toxicity ferrate fe vi as a green wastewater treatment reagent has drawn great interest rai et al 2018 talaiekhozani et al 2017 fe vi can inactivate microbes nguema and jun 2016 remove heavy metals dong et al 2019a and degrade micro pollutants such as tetrabromobisphenol a simvastatin and triclosan han et al 2018 patibandla et al 2018 yang et al 2011 in addition the final decomposition product of fe vi is ferric fe iii which is a widely used coagulant sharma et al 2016 the ability of fe vi to remove pollutants is first derived from its strong oxidation ability the redox potentials of fe vi range from 2 20 acidic conditions to 0 72 v alkaline conditions han et al 2013 wood 1958 during oxidation fe vi is first reduced to fe v fe iv via electron transfer mechanisms depending on the organic compounds being oxidized lee et al 2014 peng et al 2020 shao et al 2019 sharma 2010 the intermediates fe v fe iv are further transformed to the final product fe iii sharma 2011 although fe vi can remove various individual organic pollutants the oxidation of pollutants does not necessarily equate to toxicity reduction the transformation products of organic pollutants during oxidation processes like ozonation and ultraviolet irradiation can be more toxic rehman et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and this toxicity increase can also occur with fe vi oxidation after being oxidized by fe vi the products of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed negligible toxicity toward bacteria yang et al 2016 while the toxicity of products of imidacloprid and azithromycin toward luminescent bacteria was significantly increased zhang and jiang 2021 such contrary observations for different pollutants indicate that overall toxicity evaluations of the whole effluent are required unfortunately to date very few studies have investigated the toxicity changes in real wastewater especially the cytotoxicity and dna dsb effects in mammalian cells after fe vi treatment the final decomposition product fe iii of fe vi can further purify water as fe iii is a commonly used coagulant fe vi resultant fe iii has been reported to effectively remove phosphate arsenic antimony thallium and selenium from water lan et al 2016 liu et al 2017 xu and fu 2020 however coagulation with fe vi resultant fe iii has been mainly reported to remove inorganic nutrients and heavy metals lv et al 2018 and little attention has been paid to its use in the organic matter removal and toxicity reduction oxidation process usually transforms pollutants to oxidation products there is a possibility that fe vi resultant fe iii further removes the oxidation products and non oxidized pollutants thus reducing the toxicity of wastewater in depth the commercial fe iii such as ferric chloride and ferric sulfate is inefficient in removing the organic pollutants in water golbaz et al 2014 selcuk et al 2011 yang et al 2018a yet the coagulation performance of fe vi resultant fe iii remains unclear hindering the understanding of fe vi application in wastewater treatment therefore the purpose of this study was to understand the influences of fe vi on the cytotoxicity and dna dsb effects of secondary effluents and to clarify the contributions of oxidation and coagulation to the toxicity changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents chemicals and reagents used in this study are detailed in the supporting information si text s1 2 2 water sampling and analysis secondary effluents were sampled at the outlet of the anaerobic anoxic oxic process from municipal wwtps serving different areas in shenzhen china labeled as se1 se2 se3 and se4 each sample was filtered with a 0 45 μm filter and refrigerated at 4 c before further experiments the methods for water quality parameter measurement such as dissolved organic carbon doc ph ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem are detailed in text s2 the water quality parameters of water samples are shown in table s1 2 3 fe vi preparation and measurement potassium ferrate k2feo4 90 was prepared by ourself according to the wet chemical synthesis method delaude and laszlo 1996 yang et al 2016 immediately before use the prepared fe vi was dissolved in pre cooled 4 c ultra pure water containing 1 mm nahco3 ph 9 2 as a stock solution of fe vi yang et al 2018a the fe vi stock solution around 1 g fe l was filtered by a 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone syringe filter then the concentration was measured at 510 nm using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer ε510 nm 1150 m 1 cm 1 rush and bielski 1986 the 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts method was used to measure the concentration of residual fe vi in the water samples lee et al 2014 2 4 sample preparation the stock solution of fe vi was dosed into 4 l water samples buffered with 20 mm borate solution ph 7 the samples were stirred for 10 min 300 r min and then stood for 20 min both the oxidation and coagulation processes occurred during this time no residual fe vi was detected at the end of reaction then the 4 l samples were divided into two aliquots and each aliquot 2 l was centrifuged 4800 r min 5 min the supernatants of one aliquot were collected which were considered as the secondary effluent se that was treated by both oxidation and coagulation labelled as seoxi coag the flocs were collected and redissolved in 2000 ml of ultrapure water acidified to ph 2 with h2so4 2 m for further analysis and toxicity assay which were regarded as the organic matter removed by coagulation labelled as sefloc because the oxidation and coagulation processes occurred simultaneously the organic matter in the flocs can contain the non oxidized pollutants in se and oxidation products by fe vi the other centrifuged aliquot was adjusted to ph 2 in situ with h2so4 2 m to redissolve the floc which was considered as the secondary effluent samples that were treated by oxidation alone labelled as seoxi to verify that this separation and preparation process would not result in toxicity loss samples seoxi coag and sefloc were mixed again the toxicity in the mixed samples should be equal to the toxicity of seoxi if there was no toxicity loss it should be noted that samples only underwent in situ coagulation by fe vi were unavailable because oxidation inevitably occurs therefore an ex situ coagulation experiment was performed the fe vi stock solution was spiked into ultrapure water and left to self decompose at ph 7 for at least 1 h until no residual fe vi was detected to obtain fe iii particles yang et al 2018a the fe vi resultant fe iii particles and commercial ferric chloride were individually added to the secondary effluent samples buffered by 20 mm borate ph 7 for the coagulation experiment the samples were stirred for 10 min 300 r min and left standing for 20 min then the solution was centrifuged 4800 r min 5 min the supernatant secoag was collected for further analysis and toxicity assay 2 5 pretreatment for toxicity assays solid phase extraction spe was used as pre treatment for the toxicity assays the method is detailed elsewhere wu et al 2020 briefly samples including the supernatant and redissolved floc were adjusted to ph 2 with 2 m h2so4 and passed through the extraction cartridges oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance waters usa methanol acetone and dichloromethane were used in sequence to elute the adsorbed organic matter the eluents were dried using a nitrogen flow and dissolved in culture medium for toxicity assays the doc recovery by spe was around 80 it should be noted that although spe cannot retain inorganic pollutants the municipal wastewater used in this study should contain few heavy metals 2 6 analysis of molecular weight distribution to understand the

the particles formed during coagulation using an in situ x ray photoelectron spectrometer phi 5000 versa probe ii ulvac phi japan with a monochromatic al kα x ray source the pass energy was 58 70 ev and the step size was 0 125 ev a fe2o3 standard and a feooh standard were also measured as references 2 12 statistical analysis for the cytotoxicity assay the concentration effect curves were fitted by regression analysis with the cell viability at different sample concentrations using the four parameter equation according to a previous study yang and zhang 2013 then the concentration at 50 cell viability namely the lc50 value was used to calculate the cytotoxicity equivalents mg phenol l for dna dsbs the concentration effect curves were fitted by regression analysis using the induction rate ir of ph2ax foci at different sample concentrations with cell viabilities of 70 plewa et al 2010 the sample concentration at which the ph2ax induction rate was 1 5 50 increase against the negative control defined as the ir1 5 was used to calculate the genotoxicity equivalents μg 4 nqo l details of the toxicity equivalent calculation are presented in the text s3 one way analysis of variance anova was applied to decide the significant toxicity difference between the samples and the negative control p 0 05 if so holm sidak multiple comparisons versus the negative control were performed to determine the lowest concentration that produced toxic effects with the power of the test statistic 1 β being 0 8 at α 0 05 wagner and plewa 2017 for toxicity equivalents one way anova was also used to determine significant differences p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reduction by fe vi concentration effect curves of the cytotoxicity assays for each secondary effluent sample se1 se2 se3 and se4 from different wwtps are shown in figs 1 a and s1 all the water samples showed cytotoxicity suggesting the need for advanced treatment to further purify the secondary effluents different doses of fe vi were added to the four samples the lc50 values of all the four samples increased with increasing fe vi doses indicating decreased cytotoxicity as shown in fig 1b the cytotoxicity equivalents of the four secondary effluents ranged from 3 6 to 10 3 mg phenol l with the lc50 values being 71 103 folds concentration which were comparable to the toxicities reported in previous studies dong et al 2017 massalha et al 2018 wu et al 2019 suggesting the representativeness of the samples used in this study adding 0 5 mg l fe vi as fe can significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of the four samples p 0 05 with increasing doses of fe vi the cytotoxicity was further reduced when 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe was added the cytotoxicity of the treated samples was decreased to 1 9 3 6 mg phenol l with a reduction of 44 71 because compositions and properties of organic micropollutants in water samples investigated in this study were different during fe vi treatment the degradability of organic micropollutants and their transformation products could also vary a lot which led to the different observed toxicity removal the concentration response curves of the genotoxicity assays are shown in figs 1c and s2 genotoxicity was also decreased after addition of fe vi the genotoxicity equivalents of the secondary effluents were 3 0 4 8 µg 4 nqo l and were significantly reduced by 15 31 when 0 5 mg l fe vi as fe was added p 0 05 fig 1d adding 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe further reduced the genotoxicity equivalents by 40 59 the dna dsbs measured as the genotoxicity endpoint are the most severe case of dna damage which can activate oncogenes and cause organisms to be susceptible to cancers and many other diseases khanna 2015 both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays suggested that fe vi can effectively purify secondary effluents and improve the water quality the observed cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reduction should be because of fe vi removing toxic organic matter in the secondary effluents fe vi can reduce the toxicity of some individual organic pollutants for example propyl paraben can be oxidized by fe vi toxicities of the oxidation products of propyl paraben toward green algae daphnia and fish as calculated by the ecosar program was significantly decreased an et al 2018 sulfonamides can be oxidized by fe vi and cytotoxicity assays using human embryonic kidney cells and monocyte macrophages indicated that the transformation products showed a lower toxicity than the sulfonamides acosta rangel et al 2020 enrofloxacin has been also found to be degraded effectively by fe vi and the toxicity of the degradation products to vibrio qinghaiensis was removed significantly shao et al 2020 however analysis of limited individual compounds might not characterize the toxicity changes in the overall wastewater our study indicated for the first time that fe vi can effectively remove the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity toward mammalian cells of the pollutant mixtures extracted from secondary effluents the widely used ozonation has been shown to increase cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of secondary effluents due to formation of oxidation byproducts dong et al 2017 wu et al 2019 therefore biofiltration is typically recommended after ozonation to remove toxic oxidation byproducts it is interesting that toxicity increase was not observed for fe vi suggesting fe vi is promising in wastewater treatment the byproduct formation during ozonation such as aldehydes bromate and organic bromine have been well understood wu et al 2021 more insights into the byproduct formation during fe vi treatment is needed in the future 3 2 alleviation of intracellular oxidative stress by fe vi pollutants in wastewater can increase the ros levels in mammalian cells leading to excessive oxidative stress which can cause irreversible oxidative damage to biomacromolecules pals et al 2013 in addition excessive ros have been found to cause cytotoxicity and dna damage du et al 2020 we therefore investigated the changes in the ros levels when cells were exposed to fe vi treated secondary effluents compared with the negative control intracellular ros levels were significantly elevated when exposing cells to the spe extracts of the secondary effluent fig 2 a when the secondary effluent was treated by fe vi an obvious right shift was observed in the concentration effect curves i e intracellular oxidative stress was alleviated because ros are partly responsible for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity pals et al 2013 the decreased levels of intracellular ros could explain the detoxification effect of fe vi on secondary effluents to further verify that fe vi treatment alleviates the intracellular oxidative stress caused by secondary effluents the dna rna oxidative markers 8 hydroxy deoxyguanosine 8 ohdg 8 hydroxy guanosine 8 ohg labelled as 8 oh d g were also measured 8 oh d g is formed via hydroxy radicals attacking deoxyguanosine dna and guanosine rna at the c 8 position of guanine ng et al 2017 fig 2b shows the significantly increased 8 oh d g when exposing cells to the spe extracts p 0 05 fe vi treated secondary effluent induced the production of less 8 oh d g confirming the alleviated oxidative stress in the cells 8 ohdg as a biomarker of cancers is considered to be responsible for the initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis kryston et al 2011 8 ohg can disturb the normal expression of proteins chen and zhong 2013 these results again emphasized that fe vi is beneficial for improving water quality 3 3 contributions of oxidation and coagulation to toxicity removal both oxidation and coagulation processes occur during water treatment using fe vi to distinguish between the roles of oxidation and coagulation in removing toxicity secondary effluent se samples that underwent only oxidation seoxi underwent both oxidation and coagulation seoxi coag and the coagulation resultant flocs sefloc were prepared see materials and methods section the concentration effect curves of the mixtures of seoxi coag and sefloc were similar to those of seoxi figs s3 and s4 and the differences in the toxicities were not statistically significant p 0 05 tables s2 and s3 indicating the floc collection and redissolution process did not result in toxicity loss here toxicity removed by only the oxidation process was defined as the difference in the toxicity equivalents of se and seoxi toxicity removed by the coagulation process was defined as the difference in the toxicity equivalents of seoxi and seoxi coag the concentration response curves are presented in fig 3 a and c 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe see concentration response curves of 0 5 and 2 0 mg l fe vi in figs s5 and s6 the toxicity equivalents removed by oxidation and coagulation are presented in fig 3b and d when the samples were dosed with 0 5 mg l fe vi as fe the toxicity was mainly reduced by oxidation with cytotoxicity being decreased by 1 4 mg phenol l and genotoxicity being decreased by 0 9 μg 4 nqo l increasing the fe vi dose did not appreciably increase the decrease in toxicity caused by oxidation when the samples were dosed with 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe the removal of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by oxidation was slightly increased to 1 6 mg phenol l and 1 2 μg 4 nqo l respectively coagulation only decreased the cytotoxicity by 0 1 mg phenol l and the genotoxicity by 0 1 μg 4 nqo l when 0 5 mg l fe vi as fe was added however it is interesting that increasing the fe vi dose dramatically enhanced the reduction in toxicity by coagulation when increasing the fe vi dose to 5 0 mg l as fe the reductions in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity by coagulation were increased by a large margin to 1 2 mg phenol l and 0 8 μg 4 nqo l this might be due to the increased formation of fe iii particles therefore it could be concluded that both oxidation and coagulation processes contributed to reducing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the secondary effluent when dosing 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe oxidation accounted for approximately 60 and coagulation accounted for approximately 40 of the decreases in both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity the toxicity reduction by oxidation could be because the oxidation products formed are less toxic than the original organic compounds the products of many organic compounds oxidized by fe vi including the oxidation products of sulfonamides sulfachloropyridazine propyl paraben ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin have been demonstrated to be less toxic than the original compounds shao et al 2020 however previously coagulation by fe vi resultant fe iii has been mainly considered to be responsible for the removal of turbidity inorganic nutrients like phosphate and heavy metals shao et al 2019 very few studies have found that coagulation is effective in removing organic compounds such as p arsanilic acid by using fe vi yang et al 2018a our results found for the first time that when using fe vi for wastewater treatment the coagulation process is also very important for reducing the toxicity caused by organic matter 3 4 influence of fe vi on organic matter in secondary effluent during fe vi treatment the toxicity reduction was because of the transformation and removal of organic matter the doc uv254 feem and molecular weight mw distributions were measured to understand the changes in the organic matter in secondary effluents after adding fe vi fe vi had a limited impact on doc removal but effectively reduced the uv254 value indicating that fe vi effectively removed unsaturated bonds in the organic matter fig s7 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 fig s8 shows the fluorescence spectra of secondary effluent treated by fe vi the fluorescence intensities of all regions decreased with increasing fe vi doses indicating fe vi also degraded the fluorophores of organic matter chen et al 2003 fig 4 a shows chromatograms of the mw distribution when the secondary effluent underwent both oxidation and coagulation processes after adding fe vi the chromatograms were further de convoluted into gaussian peaks wang et al 2017a being divided into four fractions according to the apparent mw including f1 100 da f2 100 500 da f3 500 1000 da and f4 1000 da the fraction with a mw between 100 and 500 da f2 is most abundant in the secondary effluent fig 4b the mw based results show that fe vi did not remove much doc but dramatically reduced the flu intensity and uv254 absorbance especially the flu intensity and uv254 absorbance of f2 100 500 da to further distinguish between the roles of oxidation and coagulation in organic matter removal by fe vi the mw distributions of se seoxi seoxi coag and sefloc were characterized fig 4c and d shows the chromatograms and the intensity of each fraction here we define the signal intensity difference between se and seoxi coag as the total removal the signal intensity difference between se and seoxi was contributed by oxidation while the difference between seoxi and seoxi coag was contributed by coagulation by comparing the mw compositions of se seoxi and seoxi coag oxidation was found to be mainly responsible for the removal in the flu intensity and uv254 absorbance but not the doc concentrations 94 flu removal and 89 uv254 removal were resulted from oxidation this result is because the oxidation process is generally difficult to mineralize the organic matter but tends to destroy unsaturated chromophores and fluorophores huang et al 2019 unlike for oxidation by comparing the mw compositions of seoxi and seoxi coag although coagulation barely changed the flu intensity and uv254 absorbance it removed more doc contributing 92 to the doc removal especially the doc in f1 100 da and f2 100 500 da fig 4d as mentioned above a previous study found fe vi resultant fe iii can remove organic micropollutants such as p arsanilic acid through coagulation yang et al 2018a while the mw of p arsanilic acid 217 da is in the range of 100 500 da in conclusion during fe vi treatment oxidation and coagulation are complementary in organic matter removal oxidation tends to transform organic matter in the secondary effluent while coagulation may remove the transformed non transformed organic matter these results supported the observation that both oxidation and coagulation are conductive to decreasing the organic matter caused toxicity 3 5 toxicity removal by fe vi resultant fe iii and ferric chloride the coagulation performance would result from the fe iii particles from fe vi decomposition which partly removed organic matter and toxicity however previous studies have found that the commonly used coagulants containing fe iii such as ferric chloride and ferric sulfate showed poor performance in the removal of individual organic contaminants golbaz et al 2014 selcuk et al 2011 yang et al 2018a we therefore compared the coagulation effects of fe vi resultant fe iii and ferric chloride on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reduction ferric chloride 5 0 mg l of fe did not decrease the cytotoxicity of secondary effluent p 0 05 while fe vi resultant fe iii reduced the cytotoxicity by 19 which contributed 32 of the total cytotoxicity reduction by fe vi fig 5 a and b the genotoxicity assay showed similar results fig 5c and d fe vi resultant fe iii reduced the genotoxicity by 24 and contributed 52 of the total genotoxicity reduction by fe vi while ferric chloride did not significantly reduce the genotoxicity p 0 05 the different coagulation abilities for toxicity reduction between fe vi resultant fe iii and ferric chloride can be partly explained by the removed organic matter the mw distributions of organic matter in the flocs from coagulation were characterized by the doc fig 5e and f shows the chromatograms and the intensity of each fraction in the flocs namely the organic matter removed by coagulation the fe vi resultant fe iii removed more doc from the secondary effluent than did ferric chloride fig 5f suggesting a better coagulation ability for the fe vi resultant fe iii in addition the fe vi resultant fe iii mainly removed organic matter with a mw below 500 da f1 and f2 fig 5e compared with the fe vi resultant fe iii ferric chloride removed more high mw fractions 1000 da and less low mw fractions 100 da fig 5f generally the toxicity of wastewater is caused more by low mw fractions than high mw fractions hu et al 2016 yang et al 2014 which explains the better toxicity reduction by fe vi resultant fe iii compared with ferric chloride to further understand the different effects on organic matter removal and toxicity reduction the flocs from coagulation were analyzed by a hr tem compared with the flocs from ferric chloride coagulation the flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii were surrounded by amorphous substances fig s9a and b which might be the adsorbed organic matter in addition the flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii and ferric chloride had much different size distributions fig s9c and d many flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii had particle sizes less than 20 nm with an average size of 22 4 nm and a median size of 22 0 nm no flocs from ferric chloride had a size less than 20 nm and the average size and median size were 30 7 and 29 9 nm it is known that during nanoparticle formation foreign substances entering the crystal structure can inhibit the nanoparticle growth resulting in smaller nanoparticles cornell and schwertmann 2003 prucek et al 2013 the larger external surface area because of the smaller size will in turn cause higher adsorption capacity and result in more organic matter removal elmorsy et al 2019 goodwill et al 2015 lv et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in addition xps was used to analyze the oxidation state and iron speciation of the flocs from the spectra of fe 2p3 2 flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii showed a peak at a binding energy of 710 3 ev near to the peak of the fe2o3 standard 710 8 ev while the spectra of flocs from ferric chloride were more similar to the feooh standard 708 6 ev fig s9e these results were also observed in the spectra of o 1 s fig s9f and were in agreement with a previous study goodwill et al 2015 during coagulation ferric chloride forms particles through hydrolysis and precipitation goodwill et al 2015 while flocs from fe vi resultant fe iii do not extensively hydrolyze and directly yield nanoparticles that have a fe2o3 core nanoarchitecture prucek et al 2013 these different crystalline structures may be also responsible for the different observed organic matter removal and toxicity reduction as the surface coordination geometry would influence the reactivity of fe iii hydr oxides towards pollutants stumm 1992 4 conclusions this study promoted the understanding of the use of fe vi in wastewater treatment finding that fe vi is beneficial for water safety as it lowers the overall toxicity fe vi can effectively reduce the cytotoxicity and dna dsbs effects in mammalian cells of the pollutant mixtures extracted from wwtp secondary effluents when 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe was added the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity can be removed by 44 71 and 40 59 the toxicity was reduced because fe vi alleviated the pollutant induced oxidative stress in cells the oxidation and coagulation processes that occurred after fe vi addition were complementary for organic matter removal the oxidation process was favorable for the transformation of organic matter with unsaturated bonds but barely mineralized the organic matter while the coagulation process tended to remove the doc therefore both oxidation and coagulation can play important roles in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity reduction when adding 5 0 mg l fe vi as fe oxidation and coagulation accounted for 60 and 40 of the reductions in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in the process of coagulation compared with the traditional widely used coagulant ferric chloride fe vi resultant fe iii showed better performance for the removal of organic matter and reduction of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity because of the particular particle sizes and crystalline structure therefore this study would also broaden the scope of fe vi application because in addition to heavy metals fe vi resultant fe iii is also effective in organic matter and toxicity removal declaration of competing

filtration of the extract using a 0 45 µm pvdf syringe filter 2 4 statistical methods a two way anova with replication analysis significance of 95 p 0 05 were conducted to assess statistical differences when examining enzyme activity and atp in full scale media samples to determine sampling requirements statistical comparisons between biomass parameters enzyme activity and atp and organics reduction doc thm4 fp and haa9 fp removal at each facility were performed using regression analysis where the dependent variables were doc reduction and dbp fp removal the independent

statistic n is the number of relationships evaluated r is the correlation coefficient and r2 is the coefficient of variation for example evaluating 20 degrees of freedom e g 22 aggregate data from

variability in full scale biofilters a minimum number of samples required to accurately assess atp and enzyme activity in a filter or between multiple filters at a facility have not been defined by the literature prior to sampling media at various facilities an evaluation of the variability within a filter and between filters at a facility was conducted media was collected from the top 5 cm from the three full scale filters at the barrie wtp in duplicate at three locations s1 s2 s3 fig 3 these locations were selected based on accessibility at the wtp as well as health and safety considerations for the research team and plant personnel sampling location within a single filter and between filters did not statistically p 0 05 impact enzyme activity esterase fig 4 other enzymes figure s 1 to s 5 or atp fig 5 filters at this facility were backwashed every 2 3 months variability with respect to biological characterization associated with filter run time may be greater for facilities that have shorter filter runs i e backwash more frequently based on these results subsequent media sampling was conducted in duplicate from a single filter at each facility for the duration of this study 3 2 relationship between atp and biofilter effluent quality correlations between biomass characterization parameters e g atp and enzyme activity and water quality e g doc thm4 and haa9 removal were quantified using linear regression relationships between these parameters based on aggregated full and pilot scale data from three treatment facilities indicated that enzyme activity may be a better indicator of organics reduction than atp alone table 1 to normalize variations in influent water quality i e full scale settled water and filter scale full scale and pilot scale removal was considered mckie et al 2020 this interpretation of filter performance allowed for the removal of contaminants to be compared to the influent concentration e g doc or dbp fp and to not be impacted by the relative abundance of various organic components to support this simplification mass removal was also considered table s 8 and the same statically significant relationships were found the aggregated data table 1 from all full scale and pilot filters observed in this study show that atp had no significant correlation to organics removal which was in agreement with several studies liu et al 2001 emelko et al 2006 boon et al 2011 elhadidy et al 2017 sharma et al 2018 mckie et al 2019 these results further confirm that atp does not relate to filter performance in terms of doc and dbp fp removal especially when considering trends between facilities atp is a cell associated parameter that can vary at different stages of cell growth and does not indicate cellular activity for function lautenschlager et al 2014 nescerecka et al 2016 farhat et al 2018 moreover atp quantification was conducted using a luminescent based method similar to previous studies and commonly used throughout the industry pharand et al 2014 mckie et al 2019 feng et al 2020 although this method is readily available and easy to conduct it cannot distinguish between intra and extra cellular atp both of which are produced by all microorganisms intra cellular atp indicates intact viable cells whereas extra cellular atp may be released as a signalling molecule upon cell stress or damage sakakibara et al 1997 hammes et al 2010 nescerecka et al 2016 by this notion it was hypothesized that extracellular atp released from cells may adsorb to filter media e g gac and increase biomass density estimates without reflecting the true biodegradation potential these results infer that atp monitoring 1 may be unreliable due to the release and interference of extracellular atp upon cell lyses and 2 may provide an approximation of the number of bacteria on a media sample but does not provide insight into the capacity for substrate degradation such as om by cells directly hammes et al 2010 lautenschlager et al 2014 kiritis et al 2019 de vera and wert 2019 favere et al 2020 based on these results and the inherent limitations of atp other measurement tools such as enzyme activity are required to better understand the biological phenomena occurring in the biofilm to more accurately quantify biofiltration performance 3 3 the role of enzymes in relation to biofilter organics reduction enzyme activity was assumed to be a superior method for biofilter characterization as it infers a mechanism for substrate degradation as opposed inferring equal biodegradation potential by all biomass esterase has been previously shown as a potential indicator for doc and tthm removal mckie et al 2019 mckie et al 2020 the basis of causation to justify this correlation comes from the general understanding of esterase function esters carbon bound compounds are degraded into an acid and an alcohol at a rate indicative of metabolic function esters are ubiquitous functional groups as such esterase encompasses a large group of enzymes that differ in conformation and substrate specificity sood et al 2016 a similar case is found for other enzymes evaluated in this study cellulase chitinase α glucosidase ß glucosidase and ß xylosidase although similar in concept to esterase their substrates are more complex organic compounds these enzymes target specific glycosidic bonds in the degradation of complex polysaccharides carbohydrates commonly found in nature that store energy starch glycogen and maintain cell structure cellulose chitin crichton 2019 since esters and polysaccharides occur widely in nature it is hypothesized that these corresponding enzymes will be found in biofilters in concentrations proportionate to substrate availability and contribute to organic carbon reduction as the identified relationships suggest enzymes quantified from filter media samples n 22 correlated to various degrees with treatment outcomes in terms of doc and dbp fp reduction phosphatase and ß glucosidase showed significant correlations to doc tthm and thaa reduction esterase activity correlated to doc and tthm reduction while other enzymes such as chitinase α glucosidase and ß xylosidase were correlated to tthm reduction figure s 6 to s 9 although not directly associated with carbon degradation phosphatase has been previously studied as an indicator of cell activity keithley kirisits 2019 it is ubiquitous to cells and responsible for cell regulation through phosphorylation phosphorylation is a post transcriptional modification that adds a phosphate molecule to a protein resulting in a change in shape and thus function and activity this process is triggered by detection of environmental changes stress to adapt intracellular proteins and enzymes accordingly ubersax and ferrell jr 2007 despite its function not relating to the degradation of organic carbon phosphatase was significantly correlated to doc tthm and thaa reduction it was hypothesized that phosphatase provided a measure of cell activity indicative of highly active well regulated cells 3 4 evaluation of enzyme activity as an indicator of water quality at full scale enzyme activity and water quality were evaluated at three full scale facilities to assess the application of this biomass qualification method when considering full scale systems with different source waters and pre treatments organics concentration and content differ among treatment processes and locations which may impact the type and abundance of enzymes present and what om is degraded liao et al 2013 biofilter influent water parameter values are shown for the three wtps examined table 2 the elgin wtp has historically been considered to operate non biologically due to pre filter chlorine addition 0 5 mg l 0 3 mg l and relatively low settled influent water organics 2 mg doc l the impact of these operating conditions were reflected in biological characterization of the filter media e g enzyme activity and atp fig 6 esterase was at least one order of magnitude more active when compared to all other enzymes fig 6 likely due to its enzyme substrate conformation esterase represents a large group of ubiquitous enzymes that have broad substrate specificity sood et al 2016 as such the substrate for esterase detection has a simpler structure and contains few polar groups compared other enzymes evaluated e g cellulase chitinase α glucosidase ß glucosidase and ß xylosidase the non esterase carbon based substrate enzymes had similar orders of magnitude and trends in terms of activity fig 6b they have more specific enzyme substrate conformation as it relates to the degradation of polysaccharides as reflected in their highly polar more complex substrate structures robinson 2015 it was assumed that these enzymes contributed to the degradation of organic carbon in some capacity however their contributions were not well elucidated and it cannot be assumed that these enzymes act symbiotically given that each has a particular conformation substrate and function significant correlations α 0 05 in terms of doc or dbp reduction as a function of enzyme activity were observed across the three wtps for esterase activity and chitinase activity fig 7 although the variation in any given data point may be relatively large due to collecting biological samples on different days and at different times of year on average these results indicate that an increase in enzyme activity is associated with improved removal organics or dbp precursors furthermore the variability in this data may allow for other statistical interpretations of correlation i e non linear relationships but ultimately implies that a causal relationship between enzyme activity and substrate degradation in biofilters may exist these results support previous findings of mckie et al 2020 which suggests that esterase may be a good indicator for doc and tthm reduction but not thaa the aforementioned work evaluated esterase activity capacity as an organics monitoring tool in one wtp with a single source water data from the current study shows that this relationship can be inferred across treatment plants water quality conditions and filter operation the activity of chitinase suggests that its substrate consists of organics that contribute to haa fp though causal data to confirm these correlations is required atp did not significantly correlate with any doc or dbp reduction across facilities further highlighting its lack of robustness as a biological indicator several studies have observed seasonal variability in biofilter performance as a function of temperature halle et al 2015 selbes et al 2017 piche et al 2019 in general these studies show that biological activity decreases with temperature since microbial growth and degradation rates are temperature dependent which impacts biofilter performance terry and summers 2018 reviewed 117 publications and reported that biofilter toc reduction efficiency is doubled from 10 to 17 at temperatures 20 c when compared to 10 c and was 50 higher 12 when compared to 10 c to 20 c it should be noted that this was a review of published literature and did not represent findings over a range of temperatures at a specific location differences in organics compositions associated with average temperature may have resulted in higher removal as opposed to the difference in temperature alone in the current study influent biofilter water temperature at barrie ranged from 10 to 14 c peterborough ranged from 17 to 23 c and elgin ranged from 16 to 21 c therefore across the three wtps influent filter water temperature ranged from 10 23 c and no trend between temperature and treatment outcomes was observed between facilities similarly persson et al 2006 observed no impact on biofilter bdoc removal and temperature in the range of 7 20 c suggesting that between this temperature range there is no impact to biological activity degradation rates or that the removal of easily biodegradable organics occurs within the contact time available even with lower reaction rates 3 5 biomass characterization for pilot scale biofilters enzyme activity and atp were measured at the peterborough pilot plant fig 8 to determine if trends in terms of biological parameters and organics reduction found at full scale were congruent at pilot scale as well as to evaluate the impact of alternative filter media configurations and pre treatments on enzyme activity atp and organics removal a trend between atp values enzyme activity and filter media was observed the dual media filters dmf with 30 year old anthracite from full scale had higher atp but lower enzyme activity whereas the tri media filters tmf capped with virgin gac had lower atp but greater enzyme activity in addition the tmfs achieved greater doc 3 9 tthm 20 27 and thaa 15 22 removal than the dmfs 2 6 7 11 10 18 respectively when pre treated with ozone and without pre treatment figure s 10 the treatment outcome could be a function of the virgin media on the tmfs adsorbing organics however relatively higher enzyme activity and lower atp were measured which may be indicative of bacteria growth and community establishment where there exists highly active but relatively few bacteria this observation also implies that biofilter acclimation may occur more quickly in terms of biological activity than biomass development i e atp dmfs which have historically been biological at this facility despite addition of raw water chlorination to provide zebra mussel control and chlorinated backwash have an established biodome with continuous influent the lack of biological stress compared to the tmfs may explain the higher density lower activity bacteria population additionally significant correlations in terms of enzyme activity and organics removal were found for esterase activity doc and chitinase activity tthm fig 9 the significant correlation between esterase and doc confirms that previously found across the three full scale facilities fig 7 and mckie et al 2020 however there was no significant correlation at pilot scale between esterase and tthm or chitinase and thaa as was determined at full scale these data suggest that esterase and chitinase correlate to a reduction of doc and tthm and tthm and thaa respectively to some capacity at full and or pilot scale these two enzymes would be suitable for future work to define causal impacts between enzymes and doc dbp fp degradation as they consistently showed some correlation to organics removal across all filters at full scale facilities and at the pilot scale facility in agreement with the data across three full scale facilities atp did not significantly correlate with any organic s removal at pilot scale 4 conclusions this study evaluated a suite of enzymes that may be present and important to the degradation of organics and dbp precursors in wtp biofilters to assess their effectiveness as a monitoring tool for drinking water treatment biofilters this was completed by examining a range of biofilter media from pilot and full scale facilities with varying water sources and pre treatments the main conclusions are the activity of various enzymes correlates to doc and dbp removal across biofilters with diverse pre treatments scale and water sources full scale biofilters treating different source waters and with different pre treatments showed significant correlations between esterase activity and doc reduction and tthm reduction chitinase activity was related to thaa reduction pilot scale biofilters with multiple pre treatments and a fixed source water exhibited similar significant correlations between esterase activity and doc reduction and chitinase activity and thm reduction atp was consistently not a reliable measure of biological activity as it relates to doc and dbp reduction in all study biofilters future work to define causal impacts between enzyme activity and doc dbp fp degradation is required to support correlations between enzyme activity and organics removal observed in this study esterase and chitinase are good candidates for this type of work as they consistently showed some correlation to organics removal across all filters at full scale facilities and at the pilot scale facility additionally when considering all of the filters throughout this study phosphatase and β glucosidase activity demonstrate strong correlations with organics removal despite their relatively low concentrations further investigations should be conducted to determine the applicability of these enzymes for contributing to organics reduction ultimately being able to link enzyme activity with specific carbon characteristics as defined by methods such as fluorescence excitation emission matrices would allow for monitoring tailored to a specific source water without the need to survey a suite of enzymes

fredericton nb canada according to the manufacturer s instructions enzyme activity for the following enzymes carboxylic esterase phosphatase ß glucosidase α glucosidase ß xylosidase chitinase and cellulase was completed following media extraction these methods are described in detail elsewhere keon et al 2021 in brief sonication was performed using 50 ml of 50 mm tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris buffer ph 8 adjusted using hcl and 2 5 ml of bugbuster protein extraction reagent combined with 5 g of media sample and sonicated for 10 min applied energy 400 w followed by filtration of the extract using a 0 45 µm pvdf syringe filter 2 4 statistical methods a two way anova with replication analysis significance of 95 p 0 05 were conducted to assess statistical differences when examining enzyme activity and atp in full scale media samples to determine sampling requirements statistical comparisons between biomass parameters enzyme activity and atp and organics reduction doc thm4 fp and haa9 fp removal at each facility were performed using regression analysis where the dependent variables were doc reduction and dbp fp removal the independent variables included atp and enzyme activity statistical significance of linear correlations was assessed using the following equation eq 1 walpole et al 2007 1 t r n 2 1 r 2 where t is the t test statistic n is the number of relationships evaluated r is the correlation coefficient and r2 is the coefficient of variation for example evaluating 20 degrees of freedom e g 22 aggregate data from full scale and pilot scale filters and a significance level of 5 α 0 05 a statistically significant relationship is defined when r2 0 14 t 1 725 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of activity variability in full scale biofilters a minimum number of samples required to accurately assess atp and enzyme activity in a filter or between multiple filters at a facility have not been defined by the literature prior to sampling media at various facilities an evaluation of the variability within a filter and between filters at a facility was conducted media was collected from the top 5 cm from the three full scale filters at the barrie wtp in duplicate at three locations s1 s2 s3 fig 3 these locations were selected based on accessibility at the wtp as well as health and safety considerations for the research team and plant personnel sampling location within a single filter and between filters did not statistically p 0 05 impact enzyme activity esterase fig 4 other enzymes figure s 1 to s 5 or atp fig 5 filters at this facility were backwashed every 2 3 months variability with respect to biological characterization associated with filter run time may be greater for facilities that have shorter filter runs i e backwash more frequently based on these results subsequent media sampling was conducted in duplicate from a single filter at each facility for the duration of this study 3 2 relationship between atp and biofilter effluent quality correlations between biomass characterization parameters e g atp and enzyme activity and water quality e g doc thm4 and haa9 removal were quantified using linear regression relationships between these parameters based on aggregated full and pilot scale data from three treatment facilities indicated that enzyme activity may be a better indicator of organics reduction than atp alone table 1 to normalize variations in influent water quality i e full scale settled water and filter scale full scale and pilot scale removal was considered mckie et al 2020 this interpretation of filter performance allowed for the removal of contaminants to be compared to the influent concentration e g doc or dbp fp and to not be impacted by the relative abundance of various organic components to support this simplification mass removal was also considered table s 8 and the same statically significant relationships were found the aggregated data table 1 from all full scale and pilot filters observed in this study show that atp had no significant correlation to organics removal which was in agreement with several studies liu et al 2001 emelko et al 2006 boon et al 2011 elhadidy et al 2017 sharma et al 2018 mckie et al 2019 these results further confirm that atp does not relate to filter performance in terms of doc and dbp fp removal especially when considering trends between facilities atp is a cell associated parameter that can vary at different stages of cell growth and does not indicate cellular activity for function lautenschlager et al 2014 nescerecka et al 2016 farhat et al 2018 moreover atp quantification was conducted using a luminescent based method similar to previous studies and commonly used throughout the industry pharand et al 2014 mckie et al 2019 feng et al 2020 although this method is readily available and easy to conduct it cannot distinguish between intra and extra cellular atp both of which are produced by all microorganisms intra cellular atp indicates intact viable cells whereas extra cellular atp may be released as a signalling molecule upon cell stress or damage sakakibara et al 1997 hammes et al 2010 nescerecka et al 2016 by this notion it was hypothesized that extracellular atp released from cells may adsorb to filter media e g gac and increase biomass density estimates without reflecting the true biodegradation potential these results infer that atp monitoring 1 may be unreliable due to the release and interference of extracellular atp upon cell lyses and 2 may provide an approximation of the number of bacteria on a media sample but does not provide insight into the capacity for substrate degradation such as om by cells directly hammes et al 2010 lautenschlager et al 2014 kiritis et al 2019 de vera and wert 2019 favere et al 2020 based on these results and the inherent limitations of atp other measurement tools such as enzyme activity are required to better understand the biological phenomena occurring in the biofilm to more accurately quantify biofiltration performance 3 3 the role of enzymes in relation to biofilter organics reduction enzyme activity was assumed to be a superior method for biofilter characterization as it infers a mechanism for substrate degradation as opposed inferring equal biodegradation potential by all biomass esterase has been previously shown as a potential indicator for doc and tthm removal mckie et al 2019 mckie et al 2020 the basis of causation to justify this correlation comes from the general understanding of esterase function esters carbon bound compounds are degraded into an acid and an alcohol at a rate indicative of metabolic function esters are ubiquitous functional groups as such esterase encompasses a large group of enzymes that differ in conformation and substrate specificity sood et al 2016 a similar case is found for other enzymes evaluated in this study cellulase chitinase α glucosidase ß glucosidase and ß xylosidase although similar in concept to esterase their substrates are more complex organic compounds these enzymes target specific glycosidic bonds in the degradation of complex polysaccharides carbohydrates commonly found in nature that store energy starch glycogen and maintain cell structure cellulose chitin crichton 2019 since esters and polysaccharides occur widely in nature it is hypothesized that these corresponding enzymes will be found in biofilters in concentrations proportionate to substrate availability and contribute to organic carbon reduction as the identified relationships suggest enzymes quantified from filter media samples n 22 correlated to various degrees with treatment outcomes in terms of doc and dbp fp reduction phosphatase and ß glucosidase showed significant correlations to doc tthm and thaa reduction esterase activity correlated to doc and tthm reduction while other enzymes such as chitinase α glucosidase and ß xylosidase were correlated to tthm reduction figure s 6 to s 9 although not directly associated with carbon degradation phosphatase has been previously studied as an indicator of cell activity keithley kirisits 2019 it is ubiquitous to cells and responsible for cell regulation through phosphorylation phosphorylation is a post transcriptional modification that adds a phosphate molecule to a protein resulting in a change in shape and thus function and activity this process is triggered by detection of environmental changes stress to adapt intracellular proteins and enzymes accordingly ubersax and ferrell jr 2007 despite its function not relating to the degradation of organic carbon phosphatase was significantly correlated to doc tthm and thaa reduction it was hypothesized that phosphatase provided a measure of cell activity indicative of highly active well regulated cells 3 4 evaluation of enzyme activity as an indicator of water quality at full scale enzyme activity and water quality were evaluated at three full scale facilities to assess the application of this biomass qualification method when considering full scale systems with different source waters and pre treatments organics concentration and content differ among treatment processes and locations which may impact the type and abundance of enzymes present and what om is degraded liao et al 2013 biofilter influent water parameter values are shown for the three wtps examined table 2 the elgin wtp has historically been considered to operate non biologically due to pre filter chlorine addition 0 5 mg l 0 3 mg l and relatively low settled influent water organics 2 mg doc l the impact of these operating conditions were reflected in biological characterization of the filter media e g enzyme activity and atp fig 6 esterase was at least one order of magnitude more active when compared to all other enzymes fig 6 likely due to its enzyme substrate conformation esterase represents a large group of ubiquitous enzymes that have broad substrate specificity sood et al 2016 as such the substrate for esterase detection has a simpler structure and contains few polar groups compared other enzymes evaluated e g cellulase chitinase α glucosidase ß glucosidase and ß xylosidase the non esterase carbon based substrate enzymes had similar orders of magnitude and trends in terms of activity fig 6b they have more specific enzyme substrate conformation as it relates to the degradation of polysaccharides as reflected in their highly polar more complex substrate structures robinson 2015 it was assumed that these enzymes contributed to the degradation of organic carbon in some capacity however their contributions were not well elucidated and it cannot be assumed that these enzymes act symbiotically given that each has a particular conformation substrate and function significant correlations α 0 05 in terms of doc or dbp reduction as a function of enzyme activity were observed across the three wtps for esterase activity and chitinase activity fig 7 although the variation in any given data point may be relatively large due to collecting biological samples on different days and at different times of year on average these results indicate that an increase in enzyme activity is associated with improved removal organics or dbp precursors furthermore the variability in this data may allow for other statistical interpretations of correlation i e non linear relationships but ultimately implies that a causal relationship between enzyme activity and substrate degradation in biofilters may exist these results support previous findings of mckie et al 2020 which suggests that esterase may be a good indicator for doc and tthm reduction but not thaa the aforementioned work evaluated esterase activity capacity as an organics monitoring tool in one wtp with a single source water data from the current study shows that this relationship can be inferred across treatment plants water quality conditions and filter operation the activity of chitinase suggests that its substrate consists of organics that contribute to haa fp though causal data to confirm these correlations is required atp did not significantly correlate with any doc or dbp reduction across facilities further highlighting its lack of robustness as a biological indicator several studies have observed seasonal variability in biofilter performance as a function of temperature halle et al 2015 selbes et al 2017 piche et al 2019 in general these studies show that biological activity decreases with temperature since microbial growth and degradation rates are temperature dependent which impacts biofilter performance terry and summers 2018 reviewed 117 publications and reported that biofilter toc reduction efficiency is doubled from 10 to 17 at temperatures 20 c when compared to 10 c and was 50 higher 12 when compared to 10 c to 20 c it should be noted that this was a review of published literature and did not represent findings over a range of temperatures at a specific location differences in organics compositions associated with average temperature may have resulted in higher removal as opposed to the difference in temperature alone in the current study influent biofilter water temperature at barrie ranged from 10 to 14 c peterborough ranged from 17 to 23 c and elgin ranged from 16 to 21 c therefore across the three wtps influent filter water temperature ranged from 10 23 c and no trend between temperature and treatment outcomes was observed between facilities similarly persson et al 2006 observed no impact on biofilter bdoc removal and temperature in the range of 7 20 c suggesting that between this temperature range there is no impact to biological activity degradation rates or that the removal of easily biodegradable organics occurs within the contact time available even with lower reaction rates 3 5 biomass characterization for pilot scale biofilters enzyme activity and atp were measured at the peterborough pilot plant fig 8 to determine if trends in terms of biological parameters and organics reduction found at full scale were congruent at pilot scale as well as to evaluate the impact of alternative filter media configurations and pre treatments on enzyme activity atp and organics removal a trend between atp values enzyme activity and filter media was observed the dual media filters dmf with 30 year old anthracite from full scale had higher atp but lower enzyme activity whereas the tri media filters tmf capped with virgin gac had lower atp but greater enzyme activity in addition the tmfs achieved greater doc 3 9 tthm 20 27 and thaa 15 22 removal than the dmfs 2 6 7 11 10 18 respectively when pre treated with ozone and without pre treatment figure s 10 the treatment outcome could be a function of the virgin media on the tmfs adsorbing organics however relatively higher enzyme activity and lower atp were measured which may be indicative of bacteria growth and community establishment where there exists highly active but relatively few bacteria this observation also implies that biofilter acclimation may occur more quickly in terms of biological activity than biomass development i e atp dmfs which have historically been biological at this facility despite addition of raw water chlorination to provide zebra mussel control and chlorinated backwash have an established biodome with continuous influent the lack of biological stress compared to the tmfs may explain the higher density lower activity bacteria population additionally significant correlations in terms of enzyme activity and organics removal were found for esterase activity doc and chitinase activity tthm fig 9 the significant correlation between esterase and doc confirms that previously found across the three full scale facilities fig 7 and mckie et al 2020 however there was no significant correlation at pilot scale between esterase and tthm or chitinase and thaa as was determined at full scale these data suggest that esterase and chitinase correlate to a reduction of doc and tthm and tthm and thaa respectively to some capacity at full and or pilot scale these two enzymes would be suitable for future work to define causal impacts between enzymes and doc dbp fp degradation as they consistently showed some correlation to organics removal across all filters at full scale facilities and at the pilot scale facility in agreement with the data across three full scale facilities atp did not significantly correlate with any organic s removal at pilot scale 4 conclusions this study evaluated a suite of enzymes that may be present and important to the degradation of organics and dbp precursors in wtp biofilters to assess their effectiveness as a monitoring tool for drinking water treatment biofilters this was completed by examining a range of biofilter media from pilot and full scale facilities with varying water sources and pre treatments the main conclusions are the activity of various enzymes correlates to doc and dbp removal across biofilters with diverse pre treatments scale and water sources full scale biofilters treating different source waters and with different pre treatments showed significant correlations between esterase activity and doc reduction and tthm reduction chitinase activity was related to thaa reduction pilot scale biofilters with multiple pre treatments and a fixed source water exhibited similar significant correlations between esterase activity and doc reduction and chitinase activity and thm reduction atp was consistently not a reliable measure of biological activity as it relates to doc and dbp reduction in all study biofilters future work to define causal impacts between enzyme activity and doc dbp fp degradation is required to support correlations between enzyme activity and organics removal observed in this study esterase and chitinase are good candidates for this type of work as they consistently showed some correlation to organics removal across all filters at full scale facilities and at the pilot scale facility additionally when considering all of the filters throughout this study phosphatase and β glucosidase activity demonstrate strong correlations with organics removal despite their relatively low concentrations further investigations should be conducted to determine the applicability of these enzymes for contributing to organics reduction ultimately being able to link enzyme activity with specific carbon characteristics as defined by methods such as fluorescence excitation emission matrices would allow for monitoring tailored to a specific source water without the need to survey a suite of enzymes

16584,textile manufacturing poses pressing challenges on water sustainability characterized by intensive chemical consumption and waterborne pollution industrial clustering is a hallmark of textile industry development featuring a two stage wastewater treatment system consisting of in plant and centralized treatment facilities driven by increasingly stringent wastewater discharge limits three pillar stakeholders in textile industrial clusters the local government enterprises and environmental utility operators seek for systematic countermeasures by balancing contradictory interests this study presents a trilateral game model to uncover the economic and environmental tradeoffs among the three stakeholders targeting the optimization of wastewater systems the model is solidified by a representative textile industrial cluster and is then extrapolated to 242 large scale chinese textile clusters to quantify the benefits the key finds are 1 the in use wastewater systems in many clusters function with low eco efficiency 2 the optimal paradigm is to adaptively leave room at half to onefold for discharge limits from in plant to centralized treatment facilities 3 the environmental and economic benefits thereof are 24 x223c61 and 6 respectively after retrofitting to the optimal paradigm for the chinese textile clusters graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords textile industrial clusters wastewater treatment system multiple stakeholders trilateral game model economic and environmental tradeoffs 1 introduction rapid industrialization in recent decades has induced intractable environmental challenges globally such as water intensive manufacturing industries which cause severe water shortages and pollution among them the textile industry is of great importance to the economies leal filho et al 2019 and has a high environmental footprint choudhury 2014 this industry accounts for 10 of global industrial water consumption world water assessment programme 2018 i e 93 billion cubic meter cong et al 2020 consumes 25 of global chemical outputs choi et al 2011 and generates extensive wastewater accompanied by solid and gaseous wastes khan and malik 2018 ning et al 2015 rawat et al 2016 thus impeding sustainable water use punzi et al 2015 and harming the environment chen et al 2017 and humans khan and malik 2014 manufacturing process similarity and clustering development are two features in addition to waterborne issues the manufacturing process see figure s1 includes fiber production yarn fabric and knit production dyeing and finishing and garment sewing choudhury and kumar 2013 dyeing and finishing make the colorful profile of textile products yet are also the major source of environmental impacts due to the intensive use of water and chemicals choudhury 2014 and the large quantity of wastewater with dense pollutant concentrations deep colourity and poor biodegradability wu et al 2016 an industrial cluster is a geographic concentration of interconnected firms suppliers and institutions in a particular field bryan 2014 and many profound textile industrial clusters have been developed globally e g kagal five star midc maharashtra industrial development corporation in india powar et al 2012 toos industrial park in iran naghedi et al 2020 and binhai industrial park in china deng et al 2020 the clustering of the textile industry improves efficiency and competitiveness porter 1990 however it intensifies the local waterborne environmental burden in practice a two stage wastewater treatment system including in plant and sharable centralized wastewater treatment plants is common and effective to tackle waterborne issues hu et al 2019a individual enterprises in clusters are requested to treat wastewater in their own wastewater treatment plants wwtps until the effluent reaches the discharge limits of plant to centralized utility wastewater indirect discharge limits executed by the local government and then the treated wastewater is discharged into the centralized wastewater treatment plant cwwtp for further treatment such a system is useful in textile industrial clusters and has been widely employed cong et al 2020 stakeholder collaboration in which stakeholders come to a consensus on sustainability issues by ongoing interactive engagement has become an important method in sustainable water management due to the increasing complexity and interdisciplinary nature hu et al 2019b woldesenbet 2020 woldesenbet and kebede 2021 thus managing water sustainability by facilitating collaboration among multiple stakeholders will be meaningful for policy making given the three features and increasingly stringent discharge limits in the textile industry however this topic is still poorly understood three pillar stakeholders the local government enterprises and environmental utility operators are involved in textile industry clusters see table s1 to fully understand the drivers and obstacles of multi stakeholder collaboration under environmental regulations chertow 2004 it is necessary to explore the optimal paradigm in which the unilateral objective of each stakeholder is fused into a collective that maximizes the overall benefits for water sustainability in such clusters the clustering of the textile industry has witnessed a sequence of geographical transfers from developed countries to developing countries gereffi and memedovic 2003 china as the world s leading producer and exporter of textiles and clothing accounts for 40 of the global textile exports world trade organization 2020 and produces 70 of the chemical fiber more than 40 of industrial textiles and approximately 40 of household textiles chen 2019 china had 242 large scale textile industrial clusters in 2018 national development and reform commission et al 2018 the textile industry in china ranks top in water consumption and pollution generating 1840 mt a 1 of industrial wastewater approximately 10 of the total ministry of ecology and environment of china 2016 national bureau of statistics of china 2020 zhou and zhou 2019 the local government implements environmental regulations as the outreach of the central government in the current environmental management hierarchy of china yang and li 2017 which facilitates clusters to comply with environmental standards brettell 2013 china has stepwise strengthened the discharge standards for textile industrial wastewater to tackle water pollution li et al 2012 the textile industry tailored discharge standard was first issued in 1992 updated in 2012 and then modified in 2015 see table s2 in this process the indirect discharge limits have been controversial in general both enterprises and environmental utility operators are requested to retrofit their end of pipe treatment however their reluctance due to additional cost could impair the execution performance newig et al 2018 profit oriented enterprises have initiatives to produce more value with less investment environmental utility operators as the last doorkeeper are urged to implement rigorous direct emission standards but they tend to decline extra investment and transfer the pressure of pollutant removal partly upstream the roles and responsibilities of multiple stakeholders are diversified and sometimes in conflict therefore it is of great significance for the textile industry to coordinate multiple stakeholders and find a balanced tradeoff towards water sustainability the study aims to optimize the paradigm of water management in textile industrial clusters and to explore the potential of the environmental and economic benefits exemplified by china s textile industrial clusters first a trilateral game model fig 1 involving a two stage wastewater treatment system is proposed to uncover the economic and environmental tradeoffs among the three pillar stakeholders second a representative textile industrial cluster in china exemplifies the trilateral game model by designing various scenarios followed by techno economic evaluation and life cycle analysis lca then the study profiles the status of wastewater issues associated with 242 chinese textile industrial clusters and targets transformation paths to the optimal paradigm for wastewater treatment systems finally the total potential of environmental and economic benefits is quantified for china s textile industry by doing so we can establish a game theoretical model for multi stakeholder management enrich the data pool with the latest bottom up industry data for the academic community and propose policy implications for the textile industry note the circles represent the three stakeholders the squares represent processes in the wastewater treatment system and a larger arrow at the bottom refers to a higher pollution concentration 2 methods the research framework including 5 steps is illustrated in fig 2 detailed methods are further discussed as follows 2 1 model establishment by the game theory approach this study concerns three stakeholders and each of the stakeholders has several strategies game theory is a mathematical study of conflict and cooperation between intelligent and rational decision makers it is effective to evaluate the impact of different strategies of multiple participants ciardiello et al 2021 and to find a strategy profile that maximizes the overall benefits that the project provides to the system chu et al 2020a chu et al 2020b in the language of game theory a game refers to any interaction involving two or more players myerson 1991 in this case the individual players refer to the three stakeholders involved in the wastewater treatment system here we here established a tri player game models among the environmental utility enterprises and the local government based on their possible actions table 1 there are 3 players and 12 situations 2 situations are impossible in practice in the game the government can adopt loose strict or no indirect discharge standards enterprises can decide whether to upgrade their wastewater treatment facilities in accordance with stringent discharge limits and the environmental utility operators can decide whether to establish a pretreatment facility that may be helpful to stabilize the influent quality 2 2 data collection and collation the wastewater treatment systems of textile industrial clusters in china are defined as the study object we identified 242 textile industrial clusters from china development zone audit announcement catalogue national development and reform commission et al 2018 and the lists of textile industry cluster areas editorial 2010 editorial 2015 and matched the clusters with corresponding cwwtps ministry of ecology and environment of china 2020 ministry of environmental protection of china 2015 south china institute of environmental science 2019 based on the above investigation a geodatabase was established 1 cluster level information including their names coordinates approval time and areas 2 facility information including their names main treatment technologies vintage design and average treatment capacities as well as the influent and effluent qualities detailed information can be found in the source data file we used one textile industrial cluster as a case study to quantitatively explore the status of the techno economic performance and life cycle environmental impacts the case is a representative textile industrial cluster located in the yangtze river delta region more information is provided in supplementary note 1 it possesses more specific information as follows 1 wastewater treatment facilities including influent and effluent qualities sludge amounts wastewater treatment capacities and technologies chemicals and electricity consumption of 22 in plant wwtps and of the cwwtp 2 operation and maintenance operation parameters of wwtps and the cwwtp and 3 management of the textile industrial cluster including the gross industrial output value and discharge limits employed by the wwtps and cwwtp for data collection and situation recognition field trips to the case park were conducted during the research period for on site investigations and in person interviews two investigations each lasting approximately three days mainly included water quality sampling and testing and facility learning meanwhile the administrative committees and chief engineers of 23 enterprises in the park were interviewed about specific information and a behavioral ethics review process was conducted for the interviews in addition search engines and government websites were used to collect basic information of the park including environmental impact assessment reports and environmental regulatory data the data and situation used in the study case are from 2020 and were collected in november 2020 2 3 techno economic evaluation and life cycle analysis the study focused on the two stage wastewater treatment system of a typical textile industrial cluster the system boundary includes the entire process of the two stage wastewater treatment system from the treatment processes in the in plant wwtps to the cwwtp which is the total target for techno economic evaluation and lca techno economics through life cycle thinking is widely applied to quantify the financial costs of water systems cashman et al 2018 xue et al 2019 within an accurate system boundary all the costs should be accounted for during water withdrawal use and discharge thus this research proposed a cost accounting model to evaluate the whole process cost of wastewater treatment in textile industrial clusters from the perspective of life cycle thinking the system boundary of cost accounting is defined from the freshwater supply to the end of pipe discharge to the environment excluding initial rainwater and wastewater pretreatment in workshops thus the whole process cost of wastewater treatment is assumed to cover the process from the freshwater supply to final effluent discharge to the environment lyu et al 2020 including freshwater withdrawal cost depreciation cost operation cost and sludge disposal cost for both the in plant wwtps and the cwwtp detailed cost accounting processes and formulas are provided in supplementary note 3 the goal of lca is to qualify the environmental impacts of the wastewater treatment system of a textile industrial cluster which is defined as the scope of the lca the lca was conducted with gabi 8 0 professional edition a leading software program used for lca studies herrmann and moltesen 2015 first a life cycle inventory lci including the inputs and outputs of all scenarios was established and modeled in gabi see table s7 next the lci quantified the environmentally relevant inputs and outputs of the studied system which is essentially a mass and energy balance of each unit or smaller process within the larger system then the lci results were used to calculate the greenhouse gas ghg emissions co2 eq according to the ipcc report ipcc 2013 and were characterized in the life cycle impact assessment phase to account for their life cycle impacts by employing the cml2001 2016 midpoint method six categories of midpoint impacts were considered the acidification potential ap the eutrophication potential ep global warming potential gwp ozone depletion potential odp human toxicity potential htp and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp these impact categories which are closely relevant to wastewater treatment processes tong et al 2013 and the cips present focus can address the comprehensive environmental and human damage caused by research subjects finally in the lca result interpretation phase policy implications were derived based on the results above detailed life cycle analysis processes are provided in supplementary note 4 2 4 strategic solution of the optimal scenario dutta 1999 and extrapolation of the optimization potential the solution process of the trilateral game simulates the decision process involving the three stakeholders in the wastewater treatment system the payoff matrix equals the strategy set and the strategy equilibrium represents the optimal scenario of the water treatment system in the short term equilibrium each payoff matrix can be treated as a complete information static game player i s strategy set a i a i 1 a i 2 a i n i where pure strategy a i a i if the game has a pure strategy equilibrium the optimal response of player i to the opponent s strategy is a i such that b i a i a i a i u i a i a i 1 u i b i a i 1 for all b i a i at this time everyone s strategy is the optimal response and a stable situation is formed as the nash equilibrium game solution thus the scribing method can be used to solve the problem on the other hand if the game cannot reach a pure strategy nash equilibrium randomness should be introduced to solve it nash equilibrium theory proves that there exists a mixed strategy nash equilibrium mne in the limited strategic game involving limited players each of whom has limited kinds of pure strategies the mixed strategy assigns a probability to each pure strategy and a player s strategy set is a sample space δ a i denotes the probability distribution on a i such that δ a i p i p i 1 p i 2 p i n i p i j 0 j p i j 1 then the mixed strategy p i p i 1 p i 2 p i n i δ a i if p i is an mne for each player there holds u i p i p i 1 u i p i p i 1 f o r p i δ a i and player i s optimal response b i a i p i u i p i p i 1 u i p i p i 1 f o r a l l p i δ a i the mne can be solved when the expected return of player i choosing any pure strategy is the same both the pure strategy equilibrium and the mne are considered the optimal scenarios in the study after determining the optimal scenario the economic and environmental benefits per tonne of wastewater are calculated out by substituting the optimal paradigm for the other situation given the status of the cwwtps in the geodatabase the current scenario in which each textile industrial cluster is applied is clarified then according to the scenario categories the adjustment of wastewater treatment systems is conducted by assuming the corresponding transformation paths from the present situation to the optimal paradigm of the wastewater treatment system the environmental and economic benefits in 242 textile industrial clusters can be obtained by multiplying the benefits per tonne of water of the transformation path by the corresponding wastewater amount and then adding the total benefits of each path together finally all the benefits of the clusters are extrapolated to the whole textile industry in china based on the total wastewater amount 3 results 3 1 high similarity of the wastewater treatment in china s textile industry the development of the textile industry features by geographic agglomeration china s textile industry has developed many representative types of industrial clusters such as textile cities towns textile bases and textile industrial parks the geographic location of china s textile industry is illustrated by 242 large scale clusters of the three categories mentioned above see figure s2 clusters are mostly in the eastern coastal areas and are scattered in northwest and northeast china the yangtze river delta and pearl river delta regions occupy 40 of the textile industrial clusters and account for most of the textile industry outputs in china the cwwtp is a common requirement and has been widely employed in china s textile industry a geodatabase covering 242 textile industrial clusters and their cwwtps was established by 2020 including geographic coordinates vintages the year the facilities started working capacities technologies influent and effluent qualities etc fig 3 the facilities have three features 1 all of them use biotechnologies their breakdowns are shown in fig 3 2 81 of them have a design capacity between 10 000 m³ and 60 000 m³ per day and 3 67 of them were built between 2006 and 2011 the similarities demonstrate the high convergence of the development phase of chinese textile industrial clusters and the high homogeneity of the wastewater treatment system to achieve the overall leapfrogging of environmental performance detailed analysis targeting a representative chinese textile industrial cluster could act as a meaningful reference to provide policy recommendations for the water sustainability of china s textile industry a the pie chart refers to the technology structure of the facilities b the stacked curve refers to the cumulative number of facilities which is calculated as the number in the previous year and the additional number in the current year source data are provided as a source data file in the supplementary materials 3 2 techno economic evaluation and life cycle environmental impacts of a textile cluster the case textile industrial cluster contains 22 enterprises all with in plant wwtps and 1 cwwtp whose processes can be seen in table s3 in general most in plant facilities adapt biochemical treatment processes as the main technology with certain pretreatment processes to analyze the optimization potential of the wastewater treatment system in the case cluster techno economic evaluation and life cycle analysis are applied first followed by the game theory method to reveal the tradeoff of multiple stakeholders fig 4 illustrates the game matrix in line with nine scenarios of the wastewater treatment system as well as their environmental and economic impacts here 1 the centralized wastewater pretreatment plant cwwptp is a newly designed in sharable environmental utility in the cluster to collect all the wastewater from enterprise workshops for pretreatment after the cwwtp negotiates with the enterprises in the park enterprises can make joint investment and entrust relevant institutions for the construction and operation of cwwptp 2 the scenarios related to no retrofit for strict indirect limits are defined as virtual scenarios because the retrofit of in plant wwtps has been implemented in the study case a further explanation of each scenario can be found in supplementary note 2 by applying the cost accounting method we found that the annual cost of the present wastewater treatment system was 118 21 million cny in 2020 comprising 50 93 million cny of the total in plant wwtp costs and 67 28 million cny of the cwwtp costs as all the textile enterprises reached an economic output of 2 35 billion cny the annual cost for wastewater treatment was approximately 5 of the economic output the total costs of the other four actual scenarios are 104 06 135 80 142 67 and 126 64 million cny meanwhile the result of each virtual scenario was17 06 million cny less than the corresponding actual scenario see figure s3 two important points are summarized 1 a comparison of s1 with s2 and of s3 with s4 indicated that the stricter indirect discharge standard will lead to a significant cost increase for the whole system moreover both the in plant wwtps and the cwwtp cost more in wastewater treatment when the indirect discharge limit is strong such as when the cod is bless than 200 mg l 1 2 the new proposals of both direct discharge allowance and a new cwwptp tend to increase the annual cost of the system of which building and operating a new cwwptp has a significant cost increase the economic burdens of the three stakeholders involved were further calculated and are presented in table s4 first according to the on site investigation the feed in cost per tonne of industrial wastewater from enterprises to the cwwtp is 6 8 cny and the feed in cost per tonne of the municipal wastewater is 1 7 cny per tonne in s1 and s2 cwwtp can break even at present thus the total financial subsidy the cwwtp received which is the economic burden of the local government is approximately 15 01 million cny per year second the cwwtp could increase the feed in cost of industrial wastewater to ensure no economic loss thus the cost rises to 13 1 cny per tonne of industrial wastewater in s5 and vs5 the cwwtp has an annual profit of 308 million cny in four scenarios while remaining at the break even point in the remaining five scenarios third the costs of enterprises here include the costs of in plant wwtps and the cwwptp the cost reaches 122 78 million cny in s4 as the highest and 70 17 million cny in vs1 as the lowest by applying the proposed environmental impact accounting method we determined the ghg emissions and the life cycle environmental impacts of the scenarios in table s5 the impacts of virtual scenarios are consistent with the corresponding actual ones because the construction and demolition phases have comparatively nonsignificant impacts the ghg emissions of s2 are the highest at 43 000 tonnes which is approximately twice as high as those of the other scenarios in light of the six lca indicators ap gwp odp htp and maetp all increased while only ep decreased throughout the whole wastewater treatment process the detailed data in table s5 explain that in plant wwtps contribute to more environmental impacts than cwwtps in s2 s3 and s4 but less to s1 and s5 in particular the enterprises in s2 account for a large part of the environmental impacts since extra chemicals are used to remove pollutants further to commit to the much stricter indirect discharge standard to the cwwtp after all the values are normalized by setting the values of s2 to 1 s2 has the greatest ghg gwp ap htp and maetp increases s4 and s5 have the greatest odp increase and s4 has the smallest ep decrease most values of s3 s4 and s5 are very close and slightly higher than the values of s1 see figure s4 3 3 water sustainability benefits of the textile industry based on game theory solutions based on the economic costs and seven environmental impact indicators of the three stakeholders we established eight practical game matrices see table s6 the economic costs and life cycle environmental impacts of the cwwptp are regarded as the components of those of enterprises because enterprises in the industrial cluster should be responsible for the operation of the cwwptp the total amount of each midpoint impact is considered as the environmental impact of the local government because the local government should be responsible for the regional environment fortunately there exist pure strategy nash equilibriums to be exact dominant strategy equilibriums in all the game matrices as table s3 shows the dominant strategy equilibrium solutions of the environmental impact game matrices are s1 and vs1 and the solution of the economic cost game matrix is merely vs1 this demonstrates that the wastewater treatment system before retrofitting is the optimal scenario in light of the comprehensive environmental and economic burdens of the three stakeholders the best strategies of the three stakeholders are 1 the local government carries out adaptive discharge regulation on the effluents of in plant wwtps 2 the enterprises operate their in plant wwtps according to the plant tailored regulation and 3 the cwwptp is a conditional option depending on the compatibility of directly mixing workshop wastewaters based on the results the system should be improved from other scenarios to s1 if the retrofit has been done or to vs1 if the retrofit has not yet been implemented the strategic solution also reveals the room for improvement of the wastewater treatment system in the chinese textile industry in light of the actual indirect discharge status in the 242 clusters a 38 3 of the influent to cwwtps in the inventory have strictly applied the strict indirect discharge standard i e cod 200 mg l 1 b 37 8 of the influents exceed the strict standard less than 50 c 21 9 work with the loose indirect discharge standard i e 300 mg l 1 cod 500 mg l 1 and d 2 0 discharge wastewater with cod concentration higher than 500 mg l 1 to cwwtps we classified the wastewater treatment systems into four categories see fig 5 a the same as scenario s2 b the same as scenario s1 c the same as scenario vs1 and d the same as scenario vs5 then we designed tailored transformation paths for each category of the wastewater treatment system and applied them to the whole chinese textile industry by extrapolating the economic and environmental benefits per tonne of textile wastewater the annual reductions in the ghg gwp ap htp maetp values and economic cost savings will be significant compared with those of the baseline scenario with reduction rates of 26 84 23 50 60 67 52 95 35 08 and 5 55 respectively although the ep value will decrease by 9 63 table 2 most of the benefits are attributed to industrial clusters that transformed their systems from s2 to s1 since the transformation from s2 to s1 requires neither rearrangement nor upgrading of the original system the clusters observing the strict indirect discharge standards could be given more flexibility to the limits such as cod in the range of 200 400 mg l 1 so that the total impacts of china s textile industry will be effectively reduced from the perspective of life cycle thinking 3 4 uncertainty analysis we are mainly concerned with the uncertainty associated with the quality of input data including consumed chemicals and electricity amount of wastewater and sludge and pollutant concentrations both in influents and effluents first after we interviewed the managers of the enterprises on the data accuracy 5 of the basic coefficients of variance were proposed for the last four kinds of data in the practical situation then to assign additional uncertainties to all data the weidema pedigree matrix weidema and wesnæs 1996 was used to calculate the uncertainty of lca data see table s8 and s9 the corrected uncertainty was finally analysed from the data quality indices of the lca study and the modified coefficients of variance are shown in table 3 the monte carlo simulation method was then employed to explore the uncertainty of lci data and the reliability of lca results frischknecht et al 2005 the parameters vary based on the weidema matrix and the model was run 3000 times accordingly the uncertainty analysis result in table 4 suggests that the differences in parameters for all impact categories are low standard deviation 15 the most varied impact categories are odp ep and htp 4 conclusions the textile industry has promising potential in boosting sustainable development xu et al 2018 in particular driven by raising the discharge limits on industrial wastewater the two stage wastewater treatment system in the textile industry enables remarkable reductions in environmental and economic burdens as a propitious vision such potential can be achieved by collaboration among different stakeholders such as the local government enterprises and environmental utility operators this study revealed the economic and environmental optimization potentials of the chinese textile industry from the standpoint of multiple stakeholders in the wastewater treatment system based on the game theory approach by designing stakeholder targeted scenarios we established a multi stakeholder game model for evaluating the scenarios and determining optimal solutions the results show that the in use wastewater systems in many clusters function with low eco efficiency and the optimal paradigm is to adaptively leave room at half to onefold for the indirect discharge limits when all 242 large scale chinese textile clusters retrofit to the optimal paradigm the environmental and economic benefits will reach 24 x223c61 and 6 respectively the findings could provide meaningful implications for decision makers in china s textile industry and they will also be meaningful globally particularly in other developing countries that are facilitating textile industry development there are some expectations for future study for example land use savings and social benefits can also be considered further additionally it is insightful to extend the system boundary by embracing more sectors e g energy infrastructure guo et al 2020a guo et al 2020b due to their potential symbiotic connection with wastewater treatment hu et al 2020 in practice some textile industries are pursuing an ambitious closed loop paradigm i e in plant wwtp pretreated wastewater with a cod of 400 500 mg l 1 discharged to the cwwtp and then the effluent from the cwwtp recycles to enterprises with a cod less than 300 mg l 1 thus a nearly zero emission symbiosis could be established with more marginal cost savings data availability the source data

16584,textile manufacturing poses pressing challenges on water sustainability characterized by intensive chemical consumption and waterborne pollution industrial clustering is a hallmark of textile industry development featuring a two stage wastewater treatment system consisting of in plant and centralized treatment facilities driven by increasingly stringent wastewater discharge limits three pillar stakeholders in textile industrial clusters the local government enterprises and environmental utility operators seek for systematic countermeasures by balancing contradictory interests this study presents a trilateral game model to uncover the economic and environmental tradeoffs among the three stakeholders targeting the optimization of wastewater systems the model is solidified by a representative textile industrial cluster and is then extrapolated to 242 large scale chinese textile clusters to quantify the benefits the key finds are 1 the in use wastewater systems in many clusters function with low eco efficiency 2 the optimal paradigm is to adaptively leave room at half to onefold for discharge limits from in plant to centralized treatment facilities 3 the environmental and economic benefits thereof are 24 x223c61 and 6 respectively after retrofitting to the optimal paradigm for the chinese textile clusters graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords textile industrial clusters wastewater treatment system multiple stakeholders trilateral game model economic and environmental tradeoffs 1 introduction rapid industrialization in recent decades has induced intractable environmental challenges globally such as water intensive manufacturing industries which cause severe water shortages and pollution among them the textile industry is of great importance to the economies leal filho et al 2019 and has a high environmental footprint choudhury 2014 this industry accounts for 10 of global industrial water consumption world water assessment programme 2018 i e 93 billion cubic meter cong et al 2020 consumes 25 of global chemical outputs choi et al 2011 and generates extensive wastewater accompanied by solid and gaseous wastes khan and malik 2018 ning et al 2015 rawat et al 2016 thus impeding sustainable water use punzi et al 2015 and harming the environment chen et al 2017 and humans khan and malik 2014 manufacturing process similarity and clustering development are two features in addition to waterborne issues the manufacturing process see figure s1 includes fiber production yarn fabric and knit production dyeing and finishing and garment sewing choudhury and kumar 2013 dyeing and finishing make the colorful profile of textile products yet are also the major source of environmental impacts due to the intensive use of water and chemicals choudhury 2014 and the large quantity of wastewater with dense pollutant concentrations deep colourity and poor biodegradability wu et al 2016 an industrial cluster is a geographic concentration of interconnected firms suppliers and institutions in a particular field bryan 2014 and many profound textile industrial clusters have been developed globally e g kagal five star midc maharashtra industrial development corporation in india powar et al 2012 toos industrial park in iran naghedi et al 2020 and binhai industrial park in china deng et al 2020 the clustering of the textile industry improves efficiency and competitiveness porter 1990 however it intensifies the local waterborne environmental burden in practice a two stage wastewater treatment system including in plant and sharable centralized wastewater treatment plants is common and effective to tackle waterborne issues hu et al 2019a individual enterprises in clusters are requested to treat wastewater in their own wastewater treatment plants wwtps until the effluent reaches the discharge limits of plant to centralized utility wastewater indirect discharge limits executed by the local government and then the treated wastewater is discharged into the centralized wastewater treatment plant cwwtp for further treatment such a system is useful in textile industrial clusters and has been widely employed cong et al 2020 stakeholder collaboration in which stakeholders come to a consensus on sustainability issues by ongoing interactive engagement has become an important method in sustainable water management due to the increasing complexity and interdisciplinary nature hu et al 2019b woldesenbet 2020 woldesenbet and kebede 2021 thus managing water sustainability by facilitating collaboration among multiple stakeholders will be meaningful for policy making given the three features and increasingly stringent discharge limits in the textile industry however this topic is still poorly understood three pillar stakeholders the local government enterprises and environmental utility operators are involved in textile industry clusters see table s1 to fully understand the drivers and obstacles of multi stakeholder collaboration under environmental regulations chertow 2004 it is necessary to explore the optimal paradigm in which the unilateral objective of each stakeholder is fused into a collective that maximizes the overall benefits for water sustainability in such clusters the clustering of the textile industry has witnessed a sequence of geographical transfers from developed countries to developing countries gereffi and memedovic 2003 china as the world s leading producer and exporter of textiles and clothing accounts for 40 of the global textile exports world trade organization 2020 and produces 70 of the chemical fiber more than 40 of industrial textiles and approximately 40 of household textiles chen 2019 china had 242 large scale textile industrial clusters in 2018 national development and reform commission et al 2018 the textile industry in china ranks top in water consumption and pollution generating 1840 mt a 1 of industrial wastewater approximately 10 of the total ministry of ecology and environment of china 2016 national bureau of statistics of china 2020 zhou and zhou 2019 the local government implements environmental regulations as the outreach of the central government in the current environmental management hierarchy of china yang and li 2017 which facilitates clusters to comply with environmental standards brettell 2013 china has stepwise strengthened the discharge standards for textile industrial wastewater to tackle water pollution li et al 2012 the textile industry tailored discharge standard was first issued in 1992 updated in 2012 and then modified in 2015 see table s2 in this process the indirect discharge limits have been controversial in general both enterprises and environmental utility operators are requested to retrofit their end of pipe treatment however their reluctance due to additional cost could impair the execution performance newig et al 2018 profit oriented enterprises have initiatives to produce more value with less investment environmental utility operators as the last doorkeeper are urged to implement rigorous direct emission standards but they tend to decline extra investment and transfer the pressure of pollutant removal partly upstream the roles and responsibilities of multiple stakeholders are diversified and sometimes in conflict therefore it is of great significance for the textile industry to coordinate multiple stakeholders and find a balanced tradeoff towards water sustainability the study aims to optimize the paradigm of water management in textile industrial clusters and to explore the potential of the environmental and economic benefits exemplified by china s textile industrial clusters first a trilateral game model fig 1 involving a two stage wastewater treatment system is proposed to uncover the economic and environmental tradeoffs among the three pillar stakeholders second a representative textile industrial cluster in china exemplifies the trilateral game model by designing various scenarios followed by techno economic evaluation and life cycle analysis lca then the study profiles the status of wastewater issues associated with 242 chinese textile industrial clusters and targets transformation paths to the optimal paradigm for wastewater treatment systems finally the total potential of environmental and economic benefits is quantified for china s textile industry by doing so we can establish a game theoretical model for multi stakeholder management enrich the data pool with the latest bottom up industry data for the academic community and propose policy implications for the textile industry note the circles represent the three stakeholders the squares represent processes in the wastewater treatment system and a larger arrow at the bottom refers to a higher pollution concentration 2 methods the research framework including 5 steps is illustrated in fig 2 detailed methods are further discussed as follows 2 1 model establishment by the game theory approach this study concerns three stakeholders and each of the stakeholders has several strategies game theory is a mathematical study of conflict and cooperation between intelligent and rational decision makers it is effective to evaluate the impact of different strategies of multiple participants ciardiello et al 2021 and to find a strategy profile that maximizes the overall benefits that the project provides to the system chu et al 2020a chu et al 2020b in the language of game theory a game refers to any interaction involving two or more players myerson 1991 in this case the individual players refer to the three stakeholders involved in the wastewater treatment system here we here established a tri player game models among the environmental utility enterprises and the local government based on their possible actions table 1 there are 3 players and 12 situations 2 situations are impossible in practice in the game the government can adopt loose strict or no indirect discharge standards enterprises can decide whether to upgrade their wastewater treatment facilities in accordance with stringent discharge limits and the environmental utility operators can decide whether to establish a pretreatment facility that may be helpful to stabilize the influent quality 2 2 data collection and collation the wastewater treatment systems of textile industrial clusters in china are defined as the study object we identified 242 textile industrial clusters from china development zone audit announcement catalogue national development and reform commission et al 2018 and the lists of textile industry cluster areas editorial 2010 editorial 2015 and matched the clusters with corresponding cwwtps ministry of ecology and environment of china 2020 ministry of environmental protection of china 2015 south china institute of environmental science 2019 based on the above investigation a geodatabase was established 1 cluster level information including their names coordinates approval time and areas 2 facility information including their names main treatment technologies vintage design and average treatment capacities as well as the influent and effluent qualities detailed information can be found in the source data file we used one textile industrial cluster as a case study to quantitatively explore the status of the techno economic performance and life cycle environmental impacts the case is a representative textile industrial cluster located in the yangtze river delta region more information is provided in supplementary note 1 it possesses more specific information as follows 1 wastewater treatment facilities including influent and effluent qualities sludge amounts wastewater treatment capacities and technologies chemicals and electricity consumption of 22 in plant wwtps and of the cwwtp 2 operation and maintenance operation parameters of wwtps and the cwwtp and 3 management of the textile industrial cluster including the gross industrial output value and discharge limits employed by the wwtps and cwwtp for data collection and situation recognition field trips to the case park were conducted during the research period for on site investigations and in person interviews two investigations each lasting approximately three days mainly included water quality sampling and testing and facility learning meanwhile the administrative committees and chief engineers of 23 enterprises in the park were interviewed about specific information and a behavioral ethics review process was conducted for the interviews in addition search engines and government websites were used to collect basic information of the park including environmental impact assessment reports and environmental regulatory data the data and situation used in the study case are from 2020 and were collected in november 2020 2 3 techno economic evaluation and life cycle analysis the study focused on the two stage wastewater treatment system of a typical textile industrial cluster the system boundary includes the entire process of the two stage wastewater treatment system from the treatment processes in the in plant wwtps to the cwwtp which is the total target for techno economic evaluation and lca techno economics through life cycle thinking is widely applied to quantify the financial costs of water systems cashman et al 2018 xue et al 2019 within an accurate system boundary all the costs should be accounted for during water withdrawal use and discharge thus this research proposed a cost accounting model to evaluate the whole process cost of wastewater treatment in textile industrial clusters from the perspective of life cycle thinking the system boundary of cost accounting is defined from the freshwater supply to the end of pipe discharge to the environment excluding initial rainwater and wastewater pretreatment in workshops thus the whole process cost of wastewater treatment is assumed to cover the process from the freshwater supply to final effluent discharge to the environment lyu et al 2020 including freshwater withdrawal cost depreciation cost operation cost and sludge disposal cost for both the in plant wwtps and the cwwtp detailed cost accounting processes and formulas are provided in supplementary note 3 the goal of lca is to qualify the environmental impacts of the wastewater treatment system of a textile industrial cluster which is defined as the scope of the lca the lca was conducted with gabi 8 0 professional edition a leading software program used for lca studies herrmann and moltesen 2015 first a life cycle inventory lci including the inputs and outputs of all scenarios was established and modeled in gabi see table s7 next the lci quantified the environmentally relevant inputs and outputs of the studied system which is essentially a mass and energy balance of each unit or smaller process within the larger system then the lci results were used to calculate the greenhouse gas ghg emissions co2 eq according to the ipcc report ipcc 2013 and were characterized in the life cycle impact assessment phase to account for their life cycle impacts by employing the cml2001 2016 midpoint method six categories of midpoint impacts were considered the acidification potential ap the eutrophication potential ep global warming potential gwp ozone depletion potential odp human toxicity potential htp and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp these impact categories which are closely relevant to wastewater treatment processes tong et al 2013 and the cips present focus can address the comprehensive environmental and human damage caused by research subjects finally in the lca result interpretation phase policy implications were derived based on the results above detailed life cycle analysis processes are provided in supplementary note 4 2 4 strategic solution of the optimal scenario dutta 1999 and extrapolation of the optimization potential the solution process of the trilateral game simulates the decision process involving the three stakeholders in the wastewater treatment system the payoff matrix equals the strategy set and the strategy equilibrium represents the optimal scenario of the water treatment system in the short term equilibrium each payoff matrix can be treated as a complete information static game player i s strategy set a i a i 1 a i 2 a i n i where pure strategy a i a i if the game has a pure strategy equilibrium the optimal response of player i to the opponent s strategy is a i such that b i a i a i a i u i a i a i 1 u i b i a i 1 for all b i a i at this time everyone s strategy is the optimal response and a stable situation is formed as the nash equilibrium game solution thus the scribing method can be used to solve the problem on the other hand if the game cannot reach a pure strategy nash equilibrium randomness should be introduced to solve it nash equilibrium theory proves that there exists a mixed strategy nash equilibrium mne in the limited strategic game involving limited players each of whom has limited kinds of pure strategies the mixed strategy assigns a probability to each pure strategy and a player s strategy set is a sample space δ a i denotes the probability distribution on a i such that δ a i p i p i 1 p i 2 p i n i p i j 0 j p i j 1 then the mixed strategy p i p i 1 p i 2 p i n i δ a i if p i is an mne for each player there holds u i p i p i 1 u i p i p i 1 f o r p i δ a i and player i s optimal response b i a i p i u i p i p i 1 u i p i p i 1 f o r a l l p i δ a i the mne can be solved when the expected return of player i choosing any pure strategy is the same both the pure strategy equilibrium and the mne are considered the optimal scenarios in the study after determining the optimal scenario the economic and environmental benefits per tonne of wastewater are calculated out by substituting the optimal paradigm for the other situation given the status of the cwwtps in the geodatabase the current scenario in which each textile industrial cluster is applied is clarified then according to the scenario categories the adjustment of wastewater treatment systems is conducted by assuming the corresponding transformation paths from the present situation to the optimal paradigm of the wastewater treatment system the environmental and economic benefits in 242 textile industrial clusters can be obtained by multiplying the benefits per tonne of water of the transformation path by the corresponding wastewater amount and then adding the total benefits of each path together finally all the benefits of the clusters are extrapolated to the whole textile industry in china based on the total wastewater amount 3 results 3 1 high similarity of the wastewater treatment in china s textile industry the development of the textile industry features by geographic agglomeration china s textile industry has developed many representative types of industrial clusters such as textile cities towns textile bases and textile industrial parks the geographic location of china s textile industry is illustrated by 242 large scale clusters of the three categories mentioned above see figure s2 clusters are mostly in the eastern coastal areas and are scattered in northwest and northeast china the yangtze river delta and pearl river delta regions occupy 40 of the textile industrial clusters and account for most of the textile industry outputs in china the cwwtp is a common requirement and has been widely employed in china s textile industry a geodatabase covering 242 textile industrial clusters and their cwwtps was established by 2020 including geographic coordinates vintages the year the facilities started working capacities technologies influent and effluent qualities etc fig 3 the facilities have three features 1 all of them use biotechnologies their breakdowns are shown in fig 3 2 81 of them have a design capacity between 10 000 m³ and 60 000 m³ per day and 3 67 of them were built between 2006 and 2011 the similarities demonstrate the high convergence of the development phase of chinese textile industrial clusters and the high homogeneity of the wastewater treatment system to achieve the overall leapfrogging of environmental performance detailed analysis targeting a representative chinese textile industrial cluster could act as a meaningful reference to provide policy recommendations for the water sustainability of china s textile industry a the pie chart refers to the technology structure of the facilities b the stacked curve refers to the cumulative number of facilities which is calculated as the number in the previous year and the additional number in the current year source data are provided as a source data file in the supplementary materials 3 2 techno economic evaluation and life cycle environmental impacts of a textile cluster the case textile industrial cluster contains 22 enterprises all with in plant wwtps and 1 cwwtp whose processes can be seen in table s3 in general most in plant facilities adapt biochemical treatment processes as the main technology with certain pretreatment processes to analyze the optimization potential of the wastewater treatment system in the case cluster techno economic evaluation and life cycle analysis are applied first followed by the game theory method to reveal the tradeoff of multiple stakeholders fig 4 illustrates the game matrix in line with nine scenarios of the wastewater treatment system as well as their environmental and economic impacts here 1 the centralized wastewater pretreatment plant cwwptp is a newly designed in sharable environmental utility in the cluster to collect all the wastewater from enterprise workshops for pretreatment after the cwwtp negotiates with the enterprises in the park enterprises can make joint investment and entrust relevant institutions for the construction and operation of cwwptp 2 the scenarios related to no retrofit for strict indirect limits are defined as virtual scenarios because the retrofit of in plant wwtps has been implemented in the study case a further explanation of each scenario can be found in supplementary note 2 by applying the cost accounting method we found that the annual cost of the present wastewater treatment system was 118 21 million cny in 2020 comprising 50 93 million cny of the total in plant wwtp costs and 67 28 million cny of the cwwtp costs as all the textile enterprises reached an economic output of 2 35 billion cny the annual cost for wastewater treatment was approximately 5 of the economic output the total costs of the other four actual scenarios are 104 06 135 80 142 67 and 126 64 million cny meanwhile the result of each virtual scenario was17 06 million cny less than the corresponding actual scenario see figure s3 two important points are summarized 1 a comparison of s1 with s2 and of s3 with s4 indicated that the stricter indirect discharge standard will lead to a significant cost increase for the whole system moreover both the in plant wwtps and the cwwtp cost more in wastewater treatment when the indirect discharge limit is strong such as when the cod is bless than 200 mg l 1 2 the new proposals of both direct discharge allowance and a new cwwptp tend to increase the annual cost of the system of which building and operating a new cwwptp has a significant cost increase the economic burdens of the three stakeholders involved were further calculated and are presented in table s4 first according to the on site investigation the feed in cost per tonne of industrial wastewater from enterprises to the cwwtp is 6 8 cny and the feed in cost per tonne of the municipal wastewater is 1 7 cny per tonne in s1 and s2 cwwtp can break even at present thus the total financial subsidy the cwwtp received which is the economic burden of the local government is approximately 15 01 million cny per year second the cwwtp could increase the feed in cost of industrial wastewater to ensure no economic loss thus the cost rises to 13 1 cny per tonne of industrial wastewater in s5 and vs5 the cwwtp has an annual profit of 308 million cny in four scenarios while remaining at the break even point in the remaining five scenarios third the costs of enterprises here include the costs of in plant wwtps and the cwwptp the cost reaches 122 78 million cny in s4 as the highest and 70 17 million cny in vs1 as the lowest by applying the proposed environmental impact accounting method we determined the ghg emissions and the life cycle environmental impacts of the scenarios in table s5 the impacts of virtual scenarios are consistent with the corresponding actual ones because the construction and demolition phases have comparatively nonsignificant impacts the ghg emissions of s2 are the highest at 43 000 tonnes which is approximately twice as high as those of the other scenarios in light of the six lca indicators ap gwp odp htp and maetp all increased while only ep decreased throughout the whole wastewater treatment process the detailed data in table s5 explain that in plant wwtps contribute to more environmental impacts than cwwtps in s2 s3 and s4 but less to s1 and s5 in particular the enterprises in s2 account for a large part of the environmental impacts since extra chemicals are used to remove pollutants further to commit to the much stricter indirect discharge standard to the cwwtp after all the values are normalized by setting the values of s2 to 1 s2 has the greatest ghg gwp ap htp and maetp increases s4 and s5 have the greatest odp increase and s4 has the smallest ep decrease most values of s3 s4 and s5 are very close and slightly higher than the values of s1 see figure s4 3 3 water sustainability benefits of the textile industry based on game theory solutions based on the economic costs and seven environmental impact indicators of the three stakeholders we established eight practical game matrices see table s6 the economic costs and life cycle environmental impacts of the cwwptp are regarded as the components of those of enterprises because enterprises in the industrial cluster should be responsible for the operation of the cwwptp the total amount of each midpoint impact is considered as the environmental impact of the local government because the local government should be responsible for the regional environment fortunately there exist pure strategy nash equilibriums to be exact dominant strategy equilibriums in all the game matrices as table s3 shows the dominant strategy equilibrium solutions of the environmental impact game matrices are s1 and vs1 and the solution of the economic cost game matrix is merely vs1 this demonstrates that the wastewater treatment system before retrofitting is the optimal scenario in light of the comprehensive environmental and economic burdens of the three stakeholders the best strategies of the three stakeholders are 1 the local government carries out adaptive discharge regulation on the effluents of in plant wwtps 2 the enterprises operate their in plant wwtps according to the plant tailored regulation and 3 the cwwptp is a conditional option depending on the compatibility of directly mixing workshop wastewaters based on the results the system should be improved from other scenarios to s1 if the retrofit has been done or to vs1 if the retrofit has not yet been implemented the strategic solution also reveals the room for improvement of the wastewater treatment system in the chinese textile industry in light of the actual indirect discharge status in the 242 clusters a 38 3 of the influent to cwwtps in the inventory have strictly applied the strict indirect discharge standard i e cod 200 mg l 1 b 37 8 of the influents exceed the strict standard less than 50 c 21 9 work with the loose indirect discharge standard i e 300 mg l 1 cod 500 mg l 1 and d 2 0 discharge wastewater with cod concentration higher than 500 mg l 1 to cwwtps we classified the wastewater treatment systems into four categories see fig 5 a the same as scenario s2 b the same as scenario s1 c the same as scenario vs1 and d the same as scenario vs5 then we designed tailored transformation paths for each category of the wastewater treatment system and applied them to the whole chinese textile industry by extrapolating the economic and environmental benefits per tonne of textile wastewater the annual reductions in the ghg gwp ap htp maetp values and economic cost savings will be significant compared with those of the baseline scenario with reduction rates of 26 84 23 50 60 67 52 95 35 08 and 5 55 respectively although the ep value will decrease by 9 63 table 2 most of the benefits are attributed to industrial clusters that transformed their systems from s2 to s1 since the transformation from s2 to s1 requires neither rearrangement nor upgrading of the original system the clusters observing the strict indirect discharge standards could be given more flexibility to the limits such as cod in the range of 200 400 mg l 1 so that the total impacts of china s textile industry will be effectively reduced from the perspective of life cycle thinking 3 4 uncertainty analysis we are mainly concerned with the uncertainty associated with the quality of input data including consumed chemicals and electricity amount of wastewater and sludge and pollutant concentrations both in influents and effluents first after we interviewed the managers of the enterprises on the data accuracy 5 of the basic coefficients of variance were proposed for the last four kinds of data in the practical situation then to assign additional uncertainties to all data the weidema pedigree matrix weidema and wesnæs 1996 was used to calculate the uncertainty of lca data see table s8 and s9 the corrected uncertainty was finally analysed from the data quality indices of the lca study and the modified coefficients of variance are shown in table 3 the monte carlo simulation method was then employed to explore the uncertainty of lci data and the reliability of lca results frischknecht et al 2005 the parameters vary based on the weidema matrix and the model was run 3000 times accordingly the uncertainty analysis result in table 4 suggests that the differences in parameters for all impact categories are low standard deviation 15 the most varied impact categories are odp ep and htp 4 conclusions the textile industry has promising potential in boosting sustainable development xu et al 2018 in particular driven by raising the discharge limits on industrial wastewater the two stage wastewater treatment system in the textile industry enables remarkable reductions in environmental and economic burdens as a propitious vision such potential can be achieved by collaboration among different stakeholders such as the local government enterprises and environmental utility operators this study revealed the economic and environmental optimization potentials of the chinese textile industry from the standpoint of multiple stakeholders in the wastewater treatment system based on the game theory approach by designing stakeholder targeted scenarios we established a multi stakeholder game model for evaluating the scenarios and determining optimal solutions the results show that the in use wastewater systems in many clusters function with low eco efficiency and the optimal paradigm is to adaptively leave room at half to onefold for the indirect discharge limits when all 242 large scale chinese textile clusters retrofit to the optimal paradigm the environmental and economic benefits will reach 24 x223c61 and 6 respectively the findings could provide meaningful implications for decision makers in china s textile industry and they will also be meaningful globally particularly in other developing countries that are facilitating textile industry development there are some expectations for future study for example land use savings and social benefits can also be considered further additionally it is insightful to extend the system boundary by embracing more sectors e g energy infrastructure guo et al 2020a guo et al 2020b due to their potential symbiotic connection with wastewater treatment hu et al 2020 in practice some textile industries are pursuing an ambitious closed loop paradigm i e in plant wwtp pretreated wastewater with a cod of 400 500 mg l 1 discharged to the cwwtp and then the effluent from the cwwtp recycles to enterprises with a cod less than 300 mg l 1 thus a nearly zero emission symbiosis could be established with more marginal cost savings data availability the source data
