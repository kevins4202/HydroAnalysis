12840,advances in chemical synthesis have increased the complexity and degradation resistance of dyes used in textile processes this fact interferes drastically with conventional biological wastewater treatment and demands further methods to avoid environmental damage in this sense this work presents a bioflocculant produced by the alkaline hydrolysis of spent brewer s yeast a residue from the brewing industry as well as the evaluation of its performance in the precipitation of recalcitrant dyes the optimum hydrolysis system was accessed by a full 23 factorial design in terms of naoh concentration yeast mass and temperature followed by a kinetic study the solid fraction composition of the produced flocculant agent is 46 of proteins and 29 of polysaccharides the performance of the bioflocculant was evaluated in two different systems real textile wastewater containing rhodamine and a synthetic solution with flavine the effects of the flocculation variables ph temperature agitation and flocculant agent dosage were taken into consideration color removal outcomes above 80 and 90 were attained for rhodamine and flavine systems respectively further analysis of real textile wastewater for treated and untreated samples in terms of bod cod toc and light metals was performed a biodegradability test showed the employed treatment could increase microbial assimilation of the sample and reduce its persistent compounds this work shows for the first time the feasibility of the bioflocculant from spent brewer s yeast and features its potential applicability to recalcitrant compounds precipitation in textile wastewaters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords waste valorization flocculant agent rhodamine dye flavine dye data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the textile industry is known as one of the most water consuming sectors 1 it is estimated that a quantity near 100 l of water is required for dyeing and washing single jeans pants 2 this high water demand is summed with the presence of a diverse range of compounds that are involved in the industry s inner processes persistent color toxicity and low degradability are relevant characteristics of dye containing wastewaters that can further constrain the efficacy of conventional biological treatment approaches 3 the inappropriate disposal of these wastewaters may interfere with aquatic ecosystems by reducing photosynthesis capacity and turning water unsuitable for the human supply 4 several techniques have been employed for textile wastewater clarification and decontamination advanced oxidative process 5 adsorption 6 ultrafiltration 7 and electrocoagulation 2 are some examples of recently employed methodologies that present high efficiency on dye degradation separation but are still associated with high cost treatment systems for industrial wastewaters flocculation and coagulation are cost effective treatment systems that present efficiency in the industrial field however some inorganic and synthetic flocculating agents have been related to environmental and human health concerns 8 9 bioflocculants are an eco friendly alternative once it is constituted by natural components mainly carbohydrates and proteins from microorganisms according to artifon et al 10 studies that report the application of bioflocculants on dye containing wastewaters treatment have increased in recent years sun et al 11 produced polymeric substances by hydrolyzing periphytic biofilms and obtained 56 of decolorization in aniline blue solution color removal outcomes higher than 80 are reported by saha et al 12 when applying extracellular substances from several microorganisms cultivation medium on congo red dye system however the relatively low extracellular polymeric substances content released by pure culture strains imposes constraints on the application of these substances on a wide scale 11 on the other hand the extraction of biopolymer components from microbial aggregates such as industrial residues implies high bioflocculant yield and low cost requirements 10 the spent brewer s yeast is a residue of the brewing industry that has attracted interest due to its rich chemical composition 13 14 in the fermentation process the growth of biomass yields an average ratio of 2 0 kg of yeast dry weight per ton of beer produced 15 after brewing spent grain the spent brewer s yeast is considered the second largest byproduct in this industry 16 these facts highlight the huge amount of wet biomass generated and the demand for proper management of this residue traditionally its applications have comprehended mainly animal and human nutrition 17 but different applications focused on the valorization of spent brewer s yeast into other components of interest are becoming significant 18 biopolymer 15 and added value molecules recovery 13 bioactive peptides source 19 and flocculant for algae harvesting font 20 are some recent applications related to this brewing residue in this sense this work milestone is to feature a bioflocculant produced by the spent brewer s yeast from the brewing industry and for the first time evaluate its flocculating potential in the dye containing textile industry wastewaters treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of materials the spent brewer s yeast was donated by a local brewing industry after the fermentation process the collected biomass was washed twice with distilled water concentrated to 30 wt wt at 60 c and kept at 4 c awaiting experiments the produced bioflocculant was tested in two different textile wastewaters systems containing dispersive dyes from tmx brazil the first was a real effluent from a washing bath obtained from a local textile industry containing rhodamine trillon frbt od520 nm and the second was a synthetic solution containing flavine trillon f10gt 150 mg l od420 nm both dyes persist after conventional biological degradation and demand further treatment before being discharged into aquatic resources 2 2 extraction of bioflocculant the hydrolysis of the yeast was optimized in terms of naoh concentration yeast concentration and temperature by a full 23 factorial design with three center points and two axial points the variable levels applied are presented in table 1 tests were conducted in a thermostatic bath for 1 h in falcon tubes containing 10 ml of distilled water the yeast mass and 2 ml of naoh solution run at the temperature of 100 c was carried on in a heating mantle with a condenser all results were analyzed using the software statistica 8 0 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa considering a significance level of 95 the centrifuged hydrolysate containing the bioflocculant produced by the optimized process was purified with pre cooled 20 c absolute ethanol at a fourth of the supernatant volume the resulting solution was maintained at 4 c overnight for stabilization and subsequently followed to centrifugation to obtain the precipitated bioflocculant compound the extraction step was conducted twice over the same raw material to increase yield the relation between the precipitated bioflocculant dried at 60 c and the dried yeast mass determined the extraction yield after the extraction step the supernatant from hydrolyzed solution was obtained by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min and 1 ml was used in flocculation assays with 40 ml of rhodamine dye containing wastewater the ph of each sample was adjusted to 3 vigorously mixed and allowed to flocculate for 30 min before centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min the centrifugation step was necessary to settle down the still suspended flocs formed and standardize optical measurements a centrifuged sample of the wastewater at ph 3 with no addition of bioflocculant was used as a control the flocculation activity fa was measured by optical density od with a spectrometer femto model cirrus 80 and calculated according to eq 1 1 fa b a b 100 where a and b are the od of the sample and control respectively after extraction optimization a kinetic study was conducted to evaluate the effect of hydrolysis time on bioflocculant released from yeast the experiments ranged from 0 to 1 h and the fa was measured as described above 2 3 characterization of bioflocculant the functional groups presented in purified bioflocculant were examined by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir agilent cary 660 spectrometer the compounds of crude bioflocculant were determined by a centesimal composition analysis proteins and sodium content were determined following the association of official analytical chemists aoac 2016 lipids moisture and volatile and mineral residue were quantified according to the methodology described by adolfo lutz institute 2018 all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the carbohydrate content was calculated as the difference between 100 and the sum of the percentage of ash lipid moisture and protein 2 4 flocculation assays the effect of ph of the bioflocculation system on decolorization of effluent containing rhodamine and synthetic solution with flavine was evaluated using the previously described flocculation procedure that is 1 ml of the supernatant of the optimized extraction process was added to 40 ml of dye solution the final ph was adjusted in the range between 2 and 9 with naoh or hcl 1 m the system was allowed to react for 30 min and later centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min zeta potential analysis malvern zetasizer nanosizer was performed for the same ph range and the same bioflocculant dosage bioflocculant in distilled water was used as a blank for zeta potential experiments were conducted in duplicate the effect of agitation on flocculation was carried out in a jar test system composed of a squared sized vessel 12 12 cm and a straight blade impeller 7 5 2 5 cm 500 ml of wastewater and the bioflocculant were vigorously mixed at 200 rpm for 10 s and set at an agitation that ranged between 50 and 150 rpm for 30 min the effects of temperature 20 50 c and bioflocculant dosage 0 1 2 ml were separately evaluated in a flocculation system containing 40 ml of wastewater all flocculation assays were conducted twice at ph 3 and followed by centrifugation and color removal quantification the treated and untreated rhodamine dye containing wastewater was evaluated in terms of cod merk test kits bod light metals na k ca2 mg2 atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa 6300 shimadzu and toc total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu a biodegradability comparison was accessed by an adapted version of oecd 301 a doc dye away test the test was performed with fresh activated sludge using 400 ml of diluted treated and untreated solutions as medium under dark conditions constant agitation and 22 c samples were taken in duplicate for 28 days and evaluated by a toc analyzer 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioflocculant extraction table 2 presents the experimental results of color removal from a full 23 factorial design these outcomes were statistically analyzed to evaluate the effects of each variable on the flocculation activity of the resulting bioflocculant a quadratic model eq 2 was proposed to describe experimental data and all linear and quadratic terms were statistically significant p 0 5 the proposed model was validated by analysis of variance anova as presented in table 3 2 color removal 100 x 81 482 66 363 1 13 474 1 2 1 868 2 1 375 2 2 2 190 3 0 008 3 2 7 463 1 2 0 275 1 3 0 039 2 3 the counterplots in fig 1 show the predicted results from modeling in fig 1a it is possible to evaluate the behavior of variable 2 the considerable color removal obtained at the lowest addition of yeast mass run 11 points out the ability of the produced bioflocculant on rhodamine precipitation further yeast mass increments improved its availability in the medium for hydrolysis which enhanced the bioflocculant liberation and lead to better flocculation results run 12 in addition the inferior axial point considered for naoh concentration presented the lowest color removal response run 9 outcomes quickly became better as the values attain the central point 2 m and presented low disparity for further increments a similar naoh concentration was employed by sun et al 2018 in fig 1b it is worth noting the positive effect on flocculation activity as temperature augments and reaches the range near to the axial point of 100 c at the same time the variation in yeast concentration in the hydrolysis medium shows minimal effect under different temperatures both outcomes indicate that temperature plays an important role in the hydrolysis system by minimizing yeast requirements increasing efficiency in releasing and solubilizing bioflocculant in the supernatant fraction the variable s values of 2 m for naoh concentration 3 g of yeast mass and 100 c as temperature were chosen as optimal conditions based on the factorial design results focus on minimizing the brewery residue demand was taken into account once higher yeast mass addition will improve bioflocculant releasing but reduce its production yield the kinetic study on the hydrolysis process conducted under the optimized values showed that the supernatant produced reached its maximum flocculation activity of 95 after 5 min of hydrolysis and a constant decay to 88 was observed till the end of the period the reduction in flocculation activity can be attributed to the exposition of bioflocculant to the operating temperature which may promote excessive hydrolysis and degrade extracellular polymeric substances to minimize the remaining spent brewer s yeast precipitated after hydrolysis and centrifugation the cellular debris were further hydrolyzed for a second and third time under the same methodology to produce a supernatant with 47 and 18 of its initial flocculant activity respectively 3 2 bioflocculant characterization the centesimal analysis of the supernatant from alkaline extraction presented in table 4 showed that the total water and volatile content corresponds to 95 51 moreover the two main chemical components of the soluble bioflocculant are proteins and polysaccharides which correspond to 46 and 29 of the solid fraction respectively the composition of the bioflocculant is in agreement with the typical composition encountered in baker s yeast 21 the active radicles on the long molecular chains of polysaccharides and proteins are the components responsible for neutralizing negative charges and absorbing colloids which induces floc formation and precipitation 22 23 differently from common microbial extracellular polymeric substances the bioflocculant from alkaline yeast cell lysis presents a higher proteins polysaccharides ratio sun et al 2018 determined the contribution of protein content to the flocculation efficacy and indicated that it plays a significant role in the system the ftir spectra analysis depicted in fig 2 infers the chemical nature of the purified bioflocculant the spectrum presented a broad and strong band at 3440 cm 1 that indicates stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group oh which is directly related to adsorption and flocculating phenomena 24 short bands at 2920 and 2850 cm 1 correspond to aliphatic ch bending 25 26 and are classic for carbohydrates 12 the strong peaks at 1650 and 1560 cm 1 indicate co from amides and amino sugars 11 these characteristic protein groups confirm the high content of this component the prominent peak around 1420 cm 1 is characteristic of co asymmetric stretching of carboxylate ions in bioflocculant molecules 12 the intense adsorption peak at 1056 cm 1 is a typical characteristic of sugar derivatives 26 27 3 3 flocculation assays the ph of a flocculating system is a critical factor due to its interference in the dissociation of functional groups on active sites 28 the structural features surface charge and bridging ability are all related to the solution ph 29 the decolorization results from ph variation presented in fig 3 depict the high flocculation rate as the system becomes more acid reaching 85 and 95 of color removal at ph 2 for rhodamine and flavine dye systems respectively as the ph becomes less acid the decolorization results decrease brusquely and attain 5 above ph 5 for both systems this increase in ph intensifies the deprotonation of bioflocculant molecules and confers negative properties to its surface the resulting electrostatic repulsion inhibits the approximation between bioflocculant and dye molecules and promotes decay in flocculation 30 31 the correlation between zeta potential by medium ph and dye precipitation by bioflocculant activity is essential to infer the predominant flocculation mechanism and is not always cited in the literature 10 for instance an insignificant decolorization promoted by ph reduction itself points out that the bioflocculant in the medium acts as a stabilizing agent by forming bridges between dye molecules on the other hand when zeta potential reaches values proximal to zero the system loses stability due to the neutralization of surface charges and favors floc formation 32 from fig 3 the abrupt decolorization decrease in the range between ph 2 and 5 for both dyes and their stable behavior at higher ph values are directly correlated to zeta potential outcomes the decrease is even higher in the flavine dye system in ph between 3 and 4 this behavior can be attributed to a sudden protonation of hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups associated with the xanthene structure of rhodamine and the nitrogen heterocyclic ring structure of flavine dye 10 since the flavine solution is a one component system this dispersive dye molecule tends to suffer less interference in the medium when compared to rhodamine molecules within washing bath wastewater making it rapidly change its redox potential with ph variation once zeta potential is a critical factor that interferes with particle steadiness the neutralization of charges induces floc formation among particles and makes them settle it indicates that dye removal is intensely dependent on ph and that charge neutralization plays a central role in dye precipitation 33 the zeta potential blank assay for bioflocculant showed a variance from 4 9 to 2 4 mv in the ph range between 8 8 and 2 6 and it crossed the isoelectric point at ph 5 6 it indicates that the bioflocculant molecules themselves present a net electrical charge near zero and suffer ionization of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups as the ph becomes alkaline 34 the effect of agitation temperature and bioflocculant dosage parameters were evaluated separately and are presented in fig 4 flocculant agent increments influenced considerably the decolorization results firstly considering rhodamine dye the addition of 0 4 ml of bioflocculant resulted in 40 on color removal further increments improved outcomes at a slower rate it indicates the system is reaching saturation by an excess of flocculant agent 35 by adding 1 2 ml of bioflocculant the color removal result obtained was 82 considering flavine dye the addition of 0 4 ml of bioflocculant increased turbidity in the medium further increments up to 0 8 ml rapidly resulted in a color removal 93 and reached saturation the overdose of biomolecules may promote an incomplete dispersion in the medium and inhibit further flocculation activity 12 the agitation range studied did not show to interfere significantly with the outcomes for rhodamine dye a light increment of 8 on decolorization was observed between 50 and 100 rpm on the other hand the increase in agitation considerably augmented decolorization for flavine dye from 0 to 75 rpm range by favoring floc formation the textile industry wastewater is a descendent runoff of a series of chemical and hot baths so the temperature is a parameter to be considered during the wastewater treatment step the color removal results decreased by 13 and 3 as the temperature of the flocculation system increased from 20 to 50 c for rhodamine and flavine respectively it indicates that the temperature interferes negatively in the bioflocculant activity mainly due to the low thermal stability of proteins at high temperatures due to denaturalization 36 and the increase in thermal movement of particles in the medium 37 3 4 characterization of rhodamine dye containing wastewater due to the possible presence of textile additives and salts in real wastewaters the solution containing rhodamine dye deserves special attention thus a series of additional tests were conducted to infer its properties and the effect of bioflocculant addition as presented in table 5 considering the optimized condition with 72 color removal the concentration of sodium ions in the wastewater of 257 mg l indicates remaining salt incidence from the dyeing process its concentration increased to 354 mg l due to the presence of sodium hydroxide in the bioflocculant supernatant k ca 2 and mg 2 light metals ions in this order comprise the main components of yeast mineral content 38 it explains their concentration increase in the treated sample medium especially potassium ions chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and total carbon tc parameters presented a considerable increase after treatment 3 which is attributed to the yeast debris from hydrolysis it is possible to highlight that the augment of tc is attributed only to total organic carbon toc increase once inorganic carbon ic concentration decreased after treatment when it comes to the effect of bioflocculant activity in dye containing systems the literature normally expresses the outcomes in terms of color removal only and the presence of flocculant agent remaining fragments is not mentioned 10 in this work a biodegradability test was performed for the high increase in toc concentration and oxygen demand in the treated sample the data in fig 5 shows the high biodegradability of the treated sample in comparison to the untreated solution in terms of toc through 28 days it is clear to see the abrupt decrease in toc values right on the third day for both samples after day 12 the outcomes reach steadiness by the end of the test the treated and untreated samples presented a toc concentration of 30 9 0 6 mgc l and 53 1 mgc l which represent a biodegradability index of 92 and 46 respectively when considering the initial concentration it points out that yeast debris can be easily assimilated by microorganisms in conventional wastewater treatment in comparison to untreated the treated solution presented higher biodegradability and lower presence of dyestuff recalcitrant components 4 conclusions the spent brewer s yeast is a valuable resource of biological substances that deserves valorization in this study the alkaline hydrolysis of the yeast cell showed to be a promising pathway to release inner polymeric substances that can be applied in several fields the bioflocculant produced possesses efficiency on flocculation activity without cation further addition and at acid ph precipitates two potential recalcitrant dyes rhodamine and flavine although the presence of the bioflocculant increased the total organic carbon concentration in the medium the biodegradability test showed this excess can be easily mineralized by microbial activity which resulted in a final solution with both lower organic and recalcitrant components this study not only proves the potential of the bioflocculant from yeast hydrolysis in the treatment of recalcitrant dye containing wastewaters but also features the new applicability of this brewery industry byproduct declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments the authors acknowledge capes and cnpq for financial support and scholarships the authors are also grateful to labsin labmassa mass transfer laboratory and coratex

degradation separation but are still associated with high cost treatment systems for industrial wastewaters flocculation and coagulation are cost effective treatment systems that present efficiency in the industrial field however some inorganic and synthetic flocculating agents have been related to environmental and human health concerns 8 9 bioflocculants are an eco friendly alternative once it is constituted by natural components mainly carbohydrates and proteins from microorganisms according to artifon et al 10 studies that report the application of bioflocculants on dye containing wastewaters treatment have increased in recent years sun et al 11 produced polymeric substances by hydrolyzing periphytic biofilms and obtained 56 of decolorization in aniline blue solution color removal outcomes higher than 80 are reported by saha et al 12 when applying extracellular substances from several microorganisms cultivation medium on congo red dye system however the relatively low extracellular polymeric substances content released by pure culture strains imposes constraints on the application of these substances on a wide scale 11 on the other hand the extraction of biopolymer components from microbial aggregates such as industrial residues implies high bioflocculant yield and low cost requirements 10 the spent brewer s yeast is a residue of the brewing industry that has

brewing spent grain the spent brewer s yeast is considered the second largest byproduct in this industry 16 these facts highlight the huge amount of wet biomass generated and the demand for proper

applications related to this brewing residue in this sense this work milestone is to feature a bioflocculant produced by the spent brewer s yeast from the brewing industry and for the first time evaluate its flocculating potential in the dye containing textile industry wastewaters treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of materials the spent brewer s yeast was donated by a local brewing industry after the fermentation process the collected biomass was washed twice with distilled water concentrated to 30 wt wt at 60 c and kept at 4 c awaiting experiments the produced bioflocculant was tested in two different textile wastewaters systems containing dispersive dyes from tmx brazil the first was a real effluent from a washing bath obtained from a local textile industry containing rhodamine trillon frbt od520 nm and the second was a synthetic solution containing flavine trillon f10gt 150 mg l od420 nm both dyes persist after conventional biological degradation and demand further treatment before being discharged into aquatic resources 2 2 extraction of bioflocculant the hydrolysis of the yeast was optimized in terms of naoh concentration yeast concentration and temperature by a full 23 factorial design with three center points and two axial points the variable levels applied are presented in table 1 tests were conducted in a thermostatic bath for 1 h in falcon tubes containing 10 ml of distilled water the yeast mass and 2 ml of naoh solution run at the temperature of 100 c was carried on in a heating mantle with a condenser all results were analyzed

centrifugation to obtain the precipitated bioflocculant compound the extraction step was conducted twice over the same raw material to increase yield the relation between the precipitated bioflocculant dried at 60 c and the dried yeast mass determined the extraction yield after the extraction step the supernatant from hydrolyzed solution was obtained by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min and 1 ml was used in flocculation assays with 40 ml of rhodamine dye containing wastewater the ph of each sample was adjusted to 3 vigorously mixed and allowed to flocculate for 30 min before centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min the centrifugation step was necessary to settle down the still suspended flocs formed and standardize optical measurements a centrifuged sample of the wastewater

1 1 fa b a b 100 where a and b are the od of the sample and control respectively after extraction optimization a kinetic study was conducted to evaluate the effect of hydrolysis time on bioflocculant released from yeast the experiments ranged from 0 to 1 h and the fa was measured as described above 2 3 characterization of bioflocculant the functional groups presented in purified bioflocculant were examined by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir agilent cary 660 spectrometer the compounds of crude bioflocculant were determined by a centesimal composition analysis proteins and sodium content were determined following the association of official analytical chemists aoac 2016 lipids moisture and volatile and mineral residue were quantified according to the methodology described by adolfo lutz institute 2018 all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the carbohydrate content was calculated as the difference between 100 and the sum of the percentage of ash lipid moisture and protein 2 4 flocculation assays the effect of ph of the bioflocculation system on decolorization of effluent containing rhodamine and synthetic solution with flavine was evaluated using the previously described flocculation procedure that is 1 ml of the supernatant of the optimized extraction process was added to 40 ml of dye solution the final ph was adjusted in the range between 2 and 9 with naoh or hcl 1 m the system was allowed to react for 30 min and later centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min zeta potential analysis malvern zetasizer nanosizer was performed for the same ph range and the same bioflocculant dosage bioflocculant in distilled water was used as a blank for zeta potential experiments were conducted in duplicate the effect of agitation on flocculation was carried out in a jar test system composed of a squared sized vessel 12 12 cm and a straight blade impeller 7 5 2 5 cm 500 ml of wastewater and the bioflocculant were vigorously mixed at 200 rpm for 10 s and set at an agitation that ranged between 50 and 150 rpm for 30 min the effects of temperature 20 50 c and bioflocculant dosage 0 1 2 ml were separately evaluated in a flocculation system containing 40

comparison was accessed by an adapted version of oecd 301 a doc dye away test the test was performed with fresh activated sludge using 400 ml of diluted treated and untreated solutions as medium under dark conditions constant agitation and 22 c samples were taken in duplicate for 28 days and evaluated by a toc analyzer 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioflocculant extraction table 2 presents the experimental results of color removal from a full 23 factorial design these outcomes were statistically analyzed to evaluate the effects of each variable on the flocculation activity of the resulting bioflocculant a quadratic model eq 2 was proposed to describe experimental data and all linear and quadratic terms were statistically significant p 0 5 the proposed model was validated by analysis of variance anova as presented in table 3 2 color removal 100 x 81 482 66 363 1 13 474 1 2 1 868 2 1 375 2 2 2 190 3 0 008 3 2 7 463 1 2 0 275 1 3 0 039 2 3 the counterplots in fig 1 show the predicted results from modeling in fig 1a it is possible to evaluate the behavior of variable 2 the considerable color removal obtained at the lowest addition of yeast mass run 11 points out the ability of the produced bioflocculant on rhodamine precipitation further yeast mass increments improved its availability in the medium for hydrolysis which enhanced the bioflocculant liberation and lead to better flocculation results run 12 in addition the inferior axial point considered for naoh concentration presented the lowest color removal response run 9 outcomes quickly became better as the values attain the central point 2 m and presented low disparity for further increments a similar naoh concentration was employed by sun et al 2018 in fig 1b it is worth noting the positive effect on flocculation activity as temperature augments and reaches the range near to the axial point of 100 c at the same time the variation in yeast concentration in the hydrolysis medium shows minimal effect under different temperatures both outcomes indicate that temperature plays an important role in the hydrolysis system by minimizing yeast requirements increasing efficiency in releasing and solubilizing bioflocculant in the supernatant fraction the variable s values of 2 m for naoh concentration 3 g of yeast mass and 100 c as temperature were chosen as optimal conditions based on the factorial design results focus on minimizing the brewery residue demand was taken into account once higher yeast mass addition will improve bioflocculant releasing but reduce its production yield the kinetic study on the hydrolysis process conducted under the optimized values showed that the supernatant produced reached its maximum flocculation activity of 95 after 5 min of hydrolysis and a constant decay to 88 was observed till the end of the period the reduction in flocculation activity can be attributed to the exposition of bioflocculant to the operating temperature which may promote excessive hydrolysis and degrade extracellular polymeric substances to minimize the remaining spent brewer s yeast precipitated after hydrolysis and centrifugation the cellular debris were further hydrolyzed for a second and third time under the same methodology to produce a supernatant with 47 and 18 of its initial flocculant activity respectively 3 2 bioflocculant characterization the centesimal analysis of the supernatant from alkaline extraction presented in table 4 showed that the total water and volatile content corresponds to 95 51 moreover the two main chemical components of the soluble bioflocculant are proteins and polysaccharides which correspond to 46 and 29 of the solid fraction respectively the composition of the bioflocculant is in agreement with the typical composition encountered in baker s yeast 21 the active radicles on the long molecular chains of polysaccharides and proteins are the components responsible for neutralizing negative charges and absorbing colloids which induces floc formation and precipitation 22 23 differently from common microbial extracellular polymeric substances the bioflocculant from alkaline yeast cell lysis presents a higher proteins polysaccharides ratio sun et al 2018 determined the contribution of protein content to the flocculation efficacy and indicated that it plays a significant role in the system the ftir spectra analysis depicted in fig 2 infers the chemical nature of the purified bioflocculant the spectrum presented a broad and strong band at 3440 cm 1 that indicates stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group oh which is directly related to adsorption and flocculating phenomena 24 short bands at 2920 and 2850 cm 1 correspond to aliphatic ch bending 25 26 and are classic for carbohydrates 12 the strong peaks at 1650 and 1560 cm 1 indicate co from amides and amino sugars 11 these characteristic protein groups confirm the high content of this component the prominent peak around 1420 cm 1 is characteristic of co asymmetric stretching of carboxylate ions in bioflocculant molecules 12 the intense adsorption peak at 1056 cm 1 is a typical characteristic of sugar derivatives 26 27 3 3 flocculation assays the ph of a flocculating system is a critical factor due to its interference in the dissociation of functional groups on active sites 28 the structural features surface charge and bridging ability are all related to the solution ph 29 the decolorization results from ph variation presented in fig 3 depict the high flocculation rate as the system becomes more acid reaching 85 and 95 of color removal at ph 2 for rhodamine and flavine dye systems respectively as the ph becomes less acid the decolorization results decrease brusquely and attain 5 above ph 5 for both systems this increase in ph intensifies the deprotonation of bioflocculant molecules and confers negative properties to its surface the resulting electrostatic repulsion inhibits the approximation between bioflocculant and dye molecules and promotes decay in flocculation 30 31 the correlation between zeta potential by medium ph and dye precipitation by bioflocculant activity is essential to infer the predominant flocculation mechanism and is not always cited in the literature 10 for instance an insignificant decolorization promoted by ph reduction itself points out that the bioflocculant in the medium acts as a stabilizing agent by forming bridges between dye molecules on the other hand when zeta potential reaches values proximal to zero the system loses stability due to the neutralization of surface charges and favors floc formation 32 from fig 3 the abrupt decolorization decrease in the range between ph 2 and 5 for both dyes and their stable behavior at higher ph values are directly correlated to zeta potential outcomes the decrease is even higher in the flavine dye system in ph between 3 and 4 this behavior can be attributed to a sudden protonation of hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups associated with the xanthene structure of rhodamine and the nitrogen heterocyclic ring structure of flavine dye 10 since the flavine solution is a one component system this dispersive dye molecule tends to suffer less interference in the medium when compared to rhodamine molecules within washing bath wastewater making it rapidly change its redox potential with ph variation once zeta potential is a critical factor that interferes with particle steadiness the neutralization of charges induces floc formation among particles and makes them settle it indicates that dye removal is intensely dependent on ph and that charge neutralization plays a central role in dye precipitation 33 the zeta potential blank assay for bioflocculant showed a variance from 4 9 to 2 4 mv in the ph range between 8 8 and 2 6 and it crossed the isoelectric point at ph 5 6 it indicates that the bioflocculant molecules themselves present a net electrical charge near zero and suffer ionization of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups as the ph becomes alkaline 34 the effect of agitation temperature and bioflocculant dosage parameters were evaluated separately and are presented in fig 4 flocculant agent increments influenced considerably the decolorization results firstly considering rhodamine dye the addition of 0 4 ml of bioflocculant resulted in 40 on color removal further increments improved outcomes at a slower rate it indicates the system is reaching saturation by an excess of flocculant agent 35 by adding 1 2 ml of bioflocculant the color removal result obtained was 82 considering flavine dye the addition of 0 4 ml of bioflocculant increased turbidity in the medium further increments up to 0 8 ml rapidly resulted in a color removal 93 and reached saturation the overdose of biomolecules may promote an incomplete dispersion in the medium and inhibit further flocculation activity 12 the agitation range studied did not show to interfere significantly with the outcomes for rhodamine dye a light increment of 8 on decolorization was observed between 50 and 100 rpm on the other hand the increase in agitation considerably augmented decolorization for flavine dye from 0 to 75 rpm range by favoring floc formation the textile industry wastewater is a descendent runoff of a series of chemical and hot baths so the temperature is a parameter to be considered during the wastewater treatment step the color removal results decreased by 13 and 3 as the temperature of the flocculation system increased from 20 to 50 c for rhodamine and flavine respectively it indicates that the temperature interferes negatively in the bioflocculant activity mainly due to the low thermal stability of proteins at high temperatures due to denaturalization 36 and the increase in thermal movement of particles in the medium 37 3 4 characterization of rhodamine dye containing wastewater due to the possible presence of textile additives and salts in real wastewaters the solution containing rhodamine dye deserves special attention thus a series of additional tests were conducted to infer its properties and the effect of bioflocculant addition as presented in table 5 considering the optimized condition with 72 color removal the concentration of sodium ions in the wastewater of 257 mg l indicates remaining salt incidence from the dyeing process its concentration increased to 354 mg l due to the presence of sodium hydroxide in the bioflocculant supernatant k ca 2 and mg 2 light metals ions in this order comprise the main components of yeast mineral content 38 it explains their concentration increase in the treated sample medium especially potassium ions chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and total carbon tc parameters presented a considerable increase after treatment 3 which is attributed to the yeast debris from hydrolysis it is possible to highlight that the augment of tc is attributed only to total organic carbon toc increase once inorganic carbon ic concentration decreased after treatment when it comes to the effect of bioflocculant activity in dye containing systems the literature normally expresses the outcomes in terms of color removal only and the presence of flocculant agent remaining fragments is not mentioned 10 in this work a biodegradability test was performed for the high increase in toc concentration and oxygen demand in the treated sample the data in fig 5 shows the high biodegradability of the treated sample in comparison to the untreated solution in terms of toc through 28 days it is clear to see the abrupt decrease in toc values right on the third day for both samples after day 12 the outcomes reach steadiness by the end of the test the treated and untreated samples presented a toc concentration of 30 9 0 6 mgc l and 53 1 mgc l which represent a biodegradability index of 92 and 46 respectively when considering the initial concentration it points out that yeast debris can be easily assimilated by microorganisms in conventional wastewater treatment in comparison to untreated the treated solution presented higher biodegradability and lower presence of dyestuff recalcitrant components 4 conclusions the spent brewer s yeast is a valuable resource of biological substances that deserves valorization in this study the alkaline hydrolysis of the yeast cell showed to be a promising pathway to release inner polymeric substances that can be applied in several fields the bioflocculant produced possesses efficiency on flocculation activity without cation further addition and at acid ph precipitates two potential recalcitrant dyes rhodamine and flavine although the presence of the bioflocculant increased the total organic carbon concentration in the medium the biodegradability test showed this excess can be easily mineralized by microbial activity which resulted in a final solution with both lower organic and recalcitrant components this study not only proves the potential of the bioflocculant from yeast hydrolysis in the treatment of recalcitrant dye containing wastewaters but also features the new applicability of this brewery industry byproduct declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12841,with the aim to present an alternative material that can be used in adsorption degradation processes to remove pharmaceutical pollutants present in water a biocarbon was designed from melia azedarach stones material has a high surface area 1230 m2 g 1 with mainly oxygenated groups these properties give it exceptional characteristics for removing atenolol to show the versatility of the material the adsorption of atenolol in different water matrices was tested ultrapure water 0 mg l 1 caco3 solution model 200 mg l 1 caco3 and tap water from lisbon city 80 mg l 1 caco3 the pseudo second order model can well describe the adsorption kinetics kinetic constants obtained were 75 70 46 18 and 42 58 g mmol h 1 respectively the adsorption isotherms are correctly described by the langmuir model obtaining maximum adsorption capacities of 1 83 2 00 and 1 81 mmol g 1 respectively physisorption phenomena carry out the adsorption mechanism e 1 kj mol 1 between the atenolol molecule positively charged and the material s surface negatively charged forming a monolayer onto the material s surface once the material was saturated its regeneration was studied by employing thermal treatment at 450 c results show a decrease in the surface area after treatment resulting in a loss of adsorption capacity 30 this procedure makes it possible to achieve repeat cycles of adsorption degradation until the adsorbent is completely exhausted the results obtained show this new material as a promising adsorbent for wastewater treatment contaminated with pharmaceutical pollutants since it has higher adsorption capacities than those reported in the literature in different water matrices graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biocarbon biomass derived activated carbons atenolol adsorption water hardness thermal regeneration cycles data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently the quality of water resources is a fundamental aspect for sustainable development so it is necessary to design and evaluate efficient technologies for water treatment which are not only being capable of eliminating contaminants present in the effluents but also be economical clean sustainable and friendly to the environment one of the main problems of sanitation systems are the persistent organic pollutants 1 3 these compounds are highly stable and toxic which makes them resistant to conventional wastewater treatments and due to their properties they tend to remain for a long time in the environment and even bio accumulate in aquatic organisms 4 among these pollutants organic pollutants pharmaceuticals have been receiving increasing attention in the last few years due to their potential damage to the environment 5 the above is considered emerging pollutants in water because they remain unregulated these pollutants are continuously introduced into the environment and are prevalent at low concentrations 6 impacting the ecosystem and human health 7 8 pharmaceutical compounds in water are attributable to personal hygiene products pharmaceutical industry waste hospital waste and therapeutic drugs the subsistence of pharmaceutical compounds at trace levels in finished drinking water is another public health concern since little is known about potential chronic health effects 9 studies in different parts of the world america europe and asia show that the pharmaceutical compounds with a more significant presence in water are caffeine ibuprofen atenolol carbamazepine and diclofenac 10 13 for example recent studies show the presence of compounds such as atenolol and carbamazepine as a serious environmental problem to be addressed since their presence in effluents from germany and portugal has been detected where their presence was shown even after the process carried out in your wastewater treatment plants 11 among them atenolol stands out due to its low biodegradability 14 and its high presence in rivers 83 ng l 1 and wastewater treatment plants 2 μg l 1 15 16 this information evidences the need to implement a water polishing treatment to reduce the concentration of pharmaceutical compounds before discharging the effluent into the aquatic environment an innovative strategy that could be useful to treat this environmental problem is adsorption processes using re valorized materials prepared from agro industrial waste table 1 which have been presented as adsorbents with high adsorption capacities of pharmaceuticals pollutants 17 24 27 although the studies to date have presented a significant advance to remove the contaminant from water the problem is still far from being solved since the current challenges now focus on designing materials with high adsorption capacity regardless of the type of matrix containing the contaminant as well as in the development of contaminant degradation techniques once adsorbed since through this strategy it will be possible to propose friendly and respectful processes with the environment the studies presented at the moment show activated carbons prepared from inactive biomass used as bio templates and modified with physical and or chemical treatments these bio templates are found in nature and have inspiring structures that provide amazing functions which can be key in the synthesis of new materials called biocarbons 28 because of this it is possible to obtain carbon materials with controlled porous texture structural specificity and surface chemistry 29 31 in such a way that all these factors create a synergy to obtain high yields of elimination of contaminants present in water in this sense this research aims to develop a new biocarbon able to be used as adsorbent material for removing atenolol present in water prepared from agro industrial wastes melia azedarach stones commonly known as pride of india were chosen as the precursor for preparing the biocarbon since this specie is abundant in the iberian peninsula being used in gardening as a shade tree for its abundant and aromatic flowering 32 in regions such as south africa and america it is considered an invasive species 33 34 its fruits have narcotic properties and are poisonous to be ingested in quantity so they are considered hazardous waste for humans and other mammals 35 therefore a strategy to reduce and valorize this waste is preparing carbon materials that can be used to provide alternative solutions to environmental and energy issues 36 the present study aimed to synthesize and characterize melia azedarach stones derived carbon material and evaluate its properties as atenolol adsorbent in different water matrices to show its effectiveness in wastewater treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of biocarbon melia azedarach ma fruits were collected from trees on granada university spain campus the stones were cleaned by removing the peel and pulp subsequently were washed with distilled water and dried t 110 c in a second step the carbonization of the material was carried out at 800 c in an inert atmosphere heating rate 10 c min 1 residence time 1 h at 800 c the chemical activation of the material was carried out using the incipient wet impregnation method under an infrared lamp 70 c and using a concentrated solution of koh in a mass ratio of 1 3 material koh the resulting material was carbonized t 800 c for 1 h in an inert atmosphere treated with 1 m hcl and washed with distilled water until the absence of chloride ions in the washing water finally the dried material was milled and sieved to obtain a particle size between 0 074 and 0 250 mm the resulting material was labeled as bioc for comparative purposes a commercial activated carbon norit sae super nsaes lot 94 039 5 salmon cia ac amersfoort the netherlands was chosen denominated in this study as c com 2 2 characterization of the biocarbon the physicochemical properties of the synthesized materials were studied using an environmental scanning electron microscopy esem fei model quanta 400 equipment an elemental analyzer thermo finnigan 1112 series and shimadzu thermobalance model tga 50h the textural properties were studied by obtaining n2 and co2 adsorption isotherms at 196 c and 0 c respectively using an autosorb from quantachrome equipment the surface area sbet of the materials was obtained using the bet equation while the micropore volume w0 and micropore width l0 were obtained using the dr equation finally the total volume of pores v0 95 was considered from the amount of n2 adsorbed at p p0 0 95 and the micropores were calculated from w0 n2 v0 95 100 the dr equation is expressed by w w 0 exp a β e 0 2 where a is the differential molar work a rtln p 0 p w cm3 g 1 is the volume adsorbed as a liquid at an equilibrium relative pressure p 0 p and w 0 cm3 g 1 is the volume of micropores parameters e 0 and b are specific to the adsorbate adsorbent system e 0 is the characteristic energy of adsorption which is inversely proportional to the mean width of the micropores l 0 and b is the adsorbate affinity coefficient in the case of n2 at 196 c b 0 33 and for co2 at 0 c b 0 35 the molar volumes for n2 and co2 at these temperatures are 34 65 cm3 mol 1 and 43 01 cm3 mol 1 respectively finally the mean width of the micropores is determined by l 0 nm 24 e 0 kj mol the functional groups of the bioc were studied employing infrared spectroscopy for which ftir spectra of the sample were obtained before and after the adsorption studies the spectra were obtained using a bruker tensor 27 spectrophotometer between 4000 and 400 cm 1 finally to study the degree of graphitization of the material x ray diffraction xrd experiments were carried out at room temperature with a bruker d8 advance diffractometer at 0 17 min 1 from 10 to 70 2θ 2 3 adsorption studies the adsorption studies were carried out using atenolol molecular weight 266 3 g mol 1 as model molecule which was provided by generis pharmaceutical company and synthesized by kopran research laboratories limited in maharashta india to study the adsorption kinetics 30 ml of atenolol solution c0 120 mg l 1 was added to 6 0 0 2 mg of adsorbent in glass vials these experimental conditions were selected from preliminary studies varying the adsorbent dose around 3 6 mg solution volume 9 30 ml and adsorbate initial concentration 20 180 mg l 1 similarly to that reported previously by 17 the vials were sealed placed in a thermostatic bath at 30 c water bath grant gd100 controller and stirred magnetically at 700 rpm in variomag multipoint equipment samples were collected and after filtration the amount of atenolol remaining in the solution was determined by uv vis spectrophotometry genesys 10s from thermo scientific at 225 nm the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents qt mg g 1 was calculated from a mass balance table s1 to show the versatility of biocarbon synthesized in water treatment processes the adsorption of atenolol was tested in three different aqueous matrices i milli q water 0 mg l 1 caco3 content ii a solution model with high hardness 200 mg l 1 caco3 content and iii tap water from the city of lisbon portugal 80 mg l 1 caco3 content the simulated high hardness water was prepared by dissolving the necessary amount of mgcl2 and cacl2 in milli q water considering a molar ratio ca2 mg2 1 5 the determination of the hardness of the tap water was contrasted with data provided by the empresa portuguesa das aguas livres sa epal of the city of lisbon in june 2016 according to public data the water supplied to the city meets a concentration of caco3 in a range of 40 170 mg l 1 with a mean value of 80 mg l 1 2 3 1 study of the kinetic adsorption models the adsorption rate was studied from the adjustment of the experimental data to the models of pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion table s1 2 3 2 study of the isotherm adsorption models the adsorption isotherms were constructed from the experimental data once equilibrium was reached the experimental data were fitted to the langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models table s1 the range of concentrations studied was 25 a 270 mmol l 1 and the ratio mass of adsorbent volume of solution was the same used in the kinetic studies all kinetic and isotherm adsorption models were tested by performing the adjustment of the experimental data to the non linear equations using as an estimation method the algorithm of levenberg marquardt convergence criterion 1 0 10 6 2 4 studies of degradation of atenolol and reuse of biocarbon for an adsorbent material to be considered promising in water treatment processes it must have a high and rapid adsorption capacity as well as be able to have repeated adsorption desorption cycles with this objective the regeneration of bioc was studied by thermogravimetric analysis studies were carried out using 4 heating rates to evaluate the regeneration energy 10 20 30 y 40 c min 1 the studies were conducted for the original material and saturated with 120 μg l 1 of atenolol in a thermogravimetric analyzer tga shimadzu model tga 50f once the experimental conditions were obtained the material was regenerated and its use was subsequently tested in repeated adsorption desorption cycles for an initial concentration of 120 mg l 1 of atenolol under the same conditions detailed in the previous section 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbent materials the compilation of the results obtained in the characterization of the adsorbent materials by gas physisorption is presented in fig 1c and table 2 it can be seen that the biocarbon prepared from ma stones has an adsorption isotherm type i 37 characteristic of microporous solids however there was an increase in nitrogen adsorption at higher relative pressures after micropore filling indicating the presence of mesopores 38 due to the development of microporosity the material has a high surface area sbet 1230 m2 g 1 1 2 times greater than the one presented c com for the case of bioc the w0 n2 is 0 49 cm3 g 1 and w0 co2 is 0 47 cm3 g 1 that is w0 n2 w0 co2 so that for this material no constrictions in porosity and it can be considered that there is a homogeneous distribution of the size of the micropores contrary to the c com material which presents a very wide distribution in the size of the micropores w0 n2 w0 co2 it is important to highlight that n2 fills the entire volume of micropores while with co2 it is possible to characterize the narrowest micropores 0 7 nm wide due to the foregoing in the discussion of atenolol adsorption results a reference will be made to determining w0 co2 the changes in the morphology during the preparation of the adsorbent material were studied by scanning electron microscopy fig s1 the microphotographs obtained are presented in fig 1a the images for ma showed that the stones are irregular and closed structure as it has no pores on their surface however after the carbonization step ma 800 c the material presents its main characteristic channels with an average diameter of 25 μm finally the activation of the material with koh generated large pores and channels caused by the fracture of the precursor particles bioc fig 1a the results obtained by sem are satisfactorily complemented by the diffractograms obtained for the bioc sample fig 1d the diffraction patterns show a very wide peak around 2θ 23 c and a small one around 2θ 43 c attributable to the 002 and 100 planes of carbon the amplitudes of the peaks show the highly disordered nature of the material however the presence of well defined peaks at 2θ 29 and 40 may be related to inorganic impurities due to the precursor used the ash content and elemental analysis of the bioc are presented in table s2 the ash content of ma stones was very low considerably below than other lignocellulosic waste biomasses used to prepare activated carbon 39 showing that the precursor material is suitable for preparing activated carbon when comparing the results of the elemental analysis of the samples it can be seen that bioc has 4 4 more oxygen than c com most probably due to the synthesis methodology used to identify the oxygenated functional groups present on the surface of the material ft ir infrared spectroscopy studies were carried out fig 1b shows the ft ir spectra corresponding to bioc before the adsorption studies blue and after the regeneration of the material in all cases six main bands are identified the wideband centered at 3413 cm 1 is associated with stretching vibrations of oh bonds due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups 40 the small band around 2360 cm 1 can associate to c single bond o group associated with uncompensated atmospheric co2 41 while the peak near 1660 cm 1 can be attributed to quinone or conjugated ketone 42 the band close to 1620 cm 1 is attributed to vibrations of cc bonds of aromatic groups present in the material 43 at 1384 cm 1 a well defined signal attributable to the ch bond of the aldehyde groups r coh is detectable the small band centered at 1106 cm 1 can be associated with co bonds of hydroxyl groups and ether present in the material 44 finally the signal at 613 cm 1 is associated with c c c bonds characteristic of carbonized materials at high temperatures 3 2 studies of adsorption kinetics the adsorption rate of atenolol in different water matrices was studied using the synthesized biocarbon and compared versus a commercial activated carbon the results are shown in fig 2a b and c and fig s2 previous studies have shown that the critical dimension to favor the diffusion of atenolol towards an active adsorption site is 0 7 nm 17 which is why it is governed mainly by microporosity considering the textural characteristics of the materials it is possible to appreciate that this process is favorable in the case of bioc because it presents an l0 co2 0 72 nm thus no hindrance for its diffusion in the larger microporosity is likely to occur however in the case of c com the process will present difficulties due to the constrictions of the pores l0 co2 0 56 nm in all cases the adsorption process is rapid at the beginning of the process it gradually decreases approaching equilibrium due to the adsorption of atenolol is quickly on the most exposed surface of the material and slowly at the internal sites less accessible for both materials regardless of the type of water used after the first 5 h of the process about 90 of the adsorption capacity is reached the equilibrium is reached at 24 h reaching 94 of the adsorption capacity determined at equilibrium from fig 2a b c and fig s2 weber morris plot it is concluded that two diffusion mechanisms are present for both materials the first is attributable to an external mass transfer so the adsorption at the beginning of the process is fast during the first 5 h of the test on the other hand the second mechanism is attributable to a slower adsorption process after 5 h and until equilibrium is reached since the diffusion of the contaminant takes place internally in the porous texture of the material table 3 shows the kinetic parameters calculated for the tested models for all models acceptable correlation coefficients r were observed however the pseudo second order model is the one that best describes the experimental data since the maximum adsorption capacity calculated by the model qe cal adequately represents the value obtained experimentally qe exp similar results have been reported 17 22 45 which have proposed that the limiting step in the adsorption rate is the interaction of the nh groups of the atenolol molecule with the oxygenated groups present on the surface of the adsorbent material the kinetic constants k2 obtained for bioc are lower than those obtained for c com showing that the synthesized material has a similar performance with the commercial sample the best adsorption results for bioc are attributed to the absence of constrictions in the developed microporosity as previously discussed the type of water matrix used to prepare the atenolol solutions directly affects the removal rate of the pollutant for the bioc sample the kinetic constants obtained are in the order milli q water 0 mg l 1 caco3 content 75 70 g mmol 1 h 1 solution model with high hardness 200 mg l 1 caco3 content 46 18 g mmol 1 h 1 tap water from the city of lisbon portugal 80 mg l 1 caco3 content 42 58 g mmol 1 h 1 which makes it evident that the adsorption rate does not decrease linearly with respect to the hardness of the water due to the above it is proposed that under the conditions studied there will be a phenomenon of adsorption competition between the cations in solution and the atenolol pka 9 6 which will have a positive charge due to the protonation of the amine group which results in the increase of oh species in solution causing the solution ph to be basic in this condition the adsorption phenomenon for both adsorbates ca2 and atenolol are favorable for acidic adsorbents with a high content of oxygenated groups cooh c o oh and o such as bioc similarly to that previously reported by 17 3 3 studies of adsorption equilibrium the experimental data obtained and the adjustment test of the experimental data to the proposed models are presented in fig 2d e and f in contrast the parameters that describe each mathematical model are presented in table 4 the langmuir model is the one that best represents the experimental data with excellent correlation coefficients r 0 98 for all cases likewise the maximum adsorption capacities calculated by the model correctly describe those calculated experimentally the maximum adsorption capacity on average regardless of the type of water used for bioc was always higher compared to c com the difference in adsorption capacity can be discussed based on the adsorption mechanism present in each of the materials for both cases the surface chemistry is similar the oxygenated groups are predominant in both materials but bioc has 4 4 more oxygen content which contributes to the increase in the adsorption capacity as discussed in the previous section in addition it is known that the mechanism of pharmaceutical compounds adsorption onto activated carbons is controlled mainly by the π π interaction between the aromatic rings on the surface and the aromatic ring of the molecule for this reason the surface area occupied by the molecules of atenolol adsorbed satenolol was calculated using the following eq 1 1 s atenolol q m n a a p where q m is the maximum adsorption capacity a p is the projected area of an atenolol molecule 1 26 10 18 m2 molecule 1 and n a is the avogadro s number 6 022 1023 molecules mol 1 the projected area of the atenolol molecule was estimated by multiplying the dimension x 1 8 nm by the dimension y 0 7 nm 17 besides the percentage of surface area occupied by the molecules of atenolol adsorbed was estimated by eq 2 2 s s atenolol s bet x 100 the results obtained were satenolol 1365 m2 g 1 and s 111 for bioc and satenolol 880 m2 g 1 and s 83 5 for c com for bioc the s is slightly higher than 100 which can be attributed to the fact that the adsorbate molecules begin to stack one on top of the other forming multilayers on the other hand for c com there is a 16 5 porosity determined by co2 adsorption to which the atenolol molecule does not have access since the material has narrower microporous table 1 from the above it is possible to conclude that bioc has a higher adsorption capacity with respect to c com due to two mechanisms i the interaction between the oxygenated sites with the nh groups of the atenolol molecule and ii the presence of broad micropores measured by co2 adsorption which allow the atenolol molecule to diffuse throughout the total micropore system of the material allowing it to be adsorbed over the entire surface from the experimental data it can be concluded that the type of water used during the adsorption studies does not significantly affect the adsorption capacity of the materials since all of them are in the same order of magnitude and the small differences observed are within of the experimental error associated with the process bioc 0 06 mmol g 1 and c com 0 08 mmol g 1 in such a way that the presence of cations in solution only has a significant effect on the adsorption rate as discussed above the maximum adsorption capacities obtained were compared against those currently reported in literature table 1 it is appreciated that adsorption capacities of bioc are well above those obtained by different commercial active carbons and biocarbons prepared from pine or tree leaves in addition it has been shown that this does not decay at the time of conducting adsorption studies in water with high hardness content qmax water with 200 ppm caco3 2 00 mmol g 1 or in a tap water of the city of lisbon qmax water with 80 ppm caco3 1 81 mmol g 1 which makes it a promising material to be used in wastewater treatment processes to obtain additional information about the adsorption mechanism the adjustment of the experimental data to the dubinin radushkevich isotherm model was proved from which it is possible to obtain the energy associated with the process e the results obtained are presented in table 4 in which it is also observed that the model can correctly describe the experimental data for all cases regardless of the type of water and adsorbent used the energy associated with the process is 1 kj mol 1 in such a way atenolol adsorption is due to weak bonds associated with physical adsorption the information gathered proposes that the adsorption mechanism consists of a physisorption process between the atenolol molecule and the surface of the adsorbent the atenolol molecule is a secondary amine with an acidity constant pka equal to 9 6 due to which the species in solution are mainly positively charged 45 this condition favors its adsorption in acidic adsorbents with a high content of oxygenated groups cooh c o oh and o such as bioc because at the ph at which the adsorption studies were carried out these are deprotonated generating a negative charge on the surface phpzc 5 0 because of the charge difference between adsorbent adsorbate an attraction occurs due to electrostatic forces resulting in the adsorption of atenolol with weak energy bonds e 1 kj mol 1 in the proposed adsorption mechanism the limiting step in the adsorption rate is the interaction of the nh groups of the atenolol molecule with the oxygenated groups present on the surface of the adsorbent material a graphical representation of adsorption mechanism proposed to atenolol onto bioc is show in supplementary fig 3 in which the speciation diagram of the molecule is shown as well as the functional groups present on the carbon surface for the conditions tested 3 4 studies of degradation of atenolol and reuse of biocarbon the dtg profiles of the thermogravimetric analysis for the saturated samples are presented in fig 3a the results obtained are consistent with a study previously published by 17 who have shown that the first peak of decomposition observed in the lower temperature range can be caused by the desorption of the atenolol molecules weakly adsorbed onto bioc while the two broad decomposition peaks centered at 344 c and 403 c are attributable to the thermal degradation of two forms of atenolol as it must be considered that as many other pharmaceuticals it is present as a racemic mixture in the dtg profiles a shoulder is observed between 163 c and 275 c which can be attributed to the release of nh3 and isopropylamine due to the decomposition of the atenolol molecule 46 for this reason it is proposed that ammonia isopropylamine and some compounds containing carbonyl isocyanate and methyl groups are released into the atmosphere during the thermal decomposition of atenolol these suggestions are directly related to the chemical structure of atenolol and complement the studies previously reported by silva et al 47 the original biocarbon presents a low thermal degradation since after the thermal treatment maintains 83 36 4 55 on average of its initial weight the saturated samples show more significant weight losses 30 on average during the heat treatment compared to the original material the energy associated with the regeneration desorption of the material ereg as well as the arrhenius factor a were calculated from the maximum peaks observed in the dtg profile in a similar way to that reported by 17 the results obtained are presented in table s3 and are consistent with those previously reported from the above information it was decided to use a temperature of 450 c 723 k to perform the bioc regeneration because at this temperature according to de dtg data previously discuss almost all the atenolol adsorbed in the material has been eliminated once the material was used in the first adsorption cycle it was recovered and dried at 60 c for 24 h then it was introduced to a steel furnace and subjected to a treatment of 450 c in an inert atmosphere nitrogen flow of 5 cm3 min 1 at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 and a residence time of 1 h at the programmed temperature the regenerated material was characterized by ftir spectroscopy and the results obtained show the elimination of atenolol has been achieved since no new absorption bands that could be attributed to this compound are seen in the ft ir spectra another important detail to note is that the heat treatment does not damage the functional groups of the material since the bands at 3413 2360 1384 y 1106 cm 1 due to the r oh and r coh groups remain unchanged however the textural properties of material do show significant changes since the bet area decreases by 1230 to 1015 m2 g 1 as well as the volume of pores 0 49 cm3 g 1 to 0 38 cm3 g 1 which could be because the thermal treatment modifies the texture of the carbon due to the generation of constrictions in the pores resulting in low accessibility to the porosity of the original material additionally x ray diffraction studies were carried out on the material after the thermal regeneration process fig 1d the results show that the treatment does not modify the amorphous nature of the material since the material presents the same diffraction pattern as the original material after the regeneration of the material the number of cycles of adsorption desorption of the bioc to be completely exhausted was evaluated one way to predict this behavior is to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the atenolol in repeated cycles of adsorption desorption and to make an adjustment of the experimental data obtained to the model proposed by 48 to evaluate the useful life of an adsorbent material eq 3 3 q e q o k l n where q o mg g 1 is the initial adsorption capacity n is the number of adsorption desorption cycles that the adsorbent material can have and k l is the life factor of the adsorbent per cycle the data obtained are presented in fig 3b after the mathematical analysis of the model it is concluded that the biocarbon can provide up to 4 cycles of adsorption desorption until completely exhausted the post regeneration characterization studies of the material showed that the adsorption capacity depletion is due to the fact that the heat treatment used during the regeneration damages the textural properties of the material decreasing the bet surface area sbet bioc 1230 m2 g 1 vs sbet bioc reg 1015 m2 g 1 in the same order magnitude in which the capacity of adsorption decreases qmax 1st cycle 1 79 mmol g 1 vs 1 qmax 2nd cycle 1 3 mmol g 1 the above information proves that the adsorption mechanism is due to the formation of a monolayer on the surface of the adsorbent due to π π interactions between the atenolol ring and the pseudo graphitic planes of the material with an associated binding energy of e 1 kj mol 1 for this reason there is a linear relationship between the bet area of the material and its adsorption capacity as shown by the experimental data fig 4 4 conclusions the results obtained in this research work show an innovative alternative to solve the current challenges presented by the removal of emerging contaminants present in the water it has been shown that through a physicochemical treatment it is possible to synthesize a carbon material from melia azedarach stones with high atenolol adsorption capacities 2 0 mmol g 1 which are preserved regardless of the type of matrix containing the contaminant thus a strategy of thermal degradation of the contaminant has also been demonstrated once it has been captured in the solid the proposed alternative manages to eliminate the contaminant and does not significantly affect the adsorption capacity of the material in such a way that it can be used in repeated cycles the proposed solution alternative shows a friendly and environmentally friendly environmental decontamination strategy credit authorship contribution

12841,with the aim to present an alternative material that can be used in adsorption degradation processes to remove pharmaceutical pollutants present in water a biocarbon was designed from melia azedarach stones material has a high surface area 1230 m2 g 1 with mainly oxygenated groups these properties give it exceptional characteristics for removing atenolol to show the versatility of the material the adsorption of atenolol in different water matrices was tested ultrapure water 0 mg l 1 caco3 solution model 200 mg l 1 caco3 and tap water from lisbon city 80 mg l 1 caco3 the pseudo second order model can well describe the adsorption kinetics kinetic constants obtained were 75 70 46 18 and 42 58 g mmol h 1 respectively the adsorption isotherms are correctly described by the langmuir model obtaining maximum adsorption capacities of 1 83 2 00 and 1 81 mmol g 1 respectively physisorption phenomena carry out the adsorption mechanism e 1 kj mol 1 between the atenolol molecule positively charged and the material s surface negatively charged forming a monolayer onto the material s surface once the material was saturated its regeneration was studied by employing thermal treatment at 450 c results show a decrease in the surface area after treatment resulting in a loss of adsorption capacity 30 this procedure makes it possible to achieve repeat cycles of adsorption degradation until the adsorbent is completely exhausted the results obtained show this new material as a promising adsorbent for wastewater treatment contaminated with pharmaceutical pollutants since it has higher adsorption capacities than those reported in the literature in different water matrices graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biocarbon biomass derived activated carbons atenolol adsorption water hardness thermal regeneration cycles data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently the quality of water resources is a fundamental aspect for sustainable development so it is necessary to design and evaluate efficient technologies for water treatment which are not only being capable of eliminating contaminants present in the effluents but also be economical clean sustainable and friendly to the environment one of the main problems of sanitation systems are the persistent organic pollutants 1 3 these compounds are highly stable and toxic which makes them resistant to conventional wastewater treatments and due to their properties they tend to remain for a long time in the environment and even bio accumulate in aquatic organisms 4 among these pollutants organic pollutants pharmaceuticals have been receiving increasing attention in the last few years due to their potential damage to the environment 5 the above is considered emerging pollutants in water because they remain unregulated these pollutants are continuously introduced into the environment and are prevalent at low concentrations 6 impacting the ecosystem and human health 7 8 pharmaceutical compounds in water are attributable to personal hygiene products pharmaceutical industry waste hospital waste and therapeutic drugs the subsistence of pharmaceutical compounds at trace levels in finished drinking water is another public health concern since little is known about potential chronic health effects 9 studies in different parts of the world america europe and asia show that the pharmaceutical compounds with a more significant presence in water are caffeine ibuprofen atenolol carbamazepine and diclofenac 10 13 for example recent studies show the presence of compounds such as atenolol and carbamazepine as a serious environmental problem to be addressed since their presence in effluents from germany and portugal has been detected where their presence was shown even after the process carried out in your wastewater treatment plants 11 among them atenolol stands out due to its low biodegradability 14 and its high presence in rivers 83 ng l 1 and wastewater treatment plants 2 μg l 1 15 16 this information evidences the need to implement a water polishing treatment to reduce the concentration of pharmaceutical compounds before discharging the effluent into the aquatic environment an innovative strategy that could be useful to treat this environmental problem is adsorption processes using re valorized materials prepared from agro industrial waste table 1 which have been presented as adsorbents with high adsorption capacities of pharmaceuticals pollutants 17 24 27 although the studies to date have presented a significant advance to remove the contaminant from water the problem is still far from being solved since the current challenges now focus on designing materials with high adsorption capacity regardless of the type of matrix containing the contaminant as well as in the development of contaminant degradation techniques once adsorbed since through this strategy it will be possible to propose friendly and respectful processes with the environment the studies presented at the moment show activated carbons prepared from inactive biomass used as bio templates and modified with physical and or chemical treatments these bio templates are found in nature and have inspiring structures that provide amazing functions which can be key in the synthesis of new materials called biocarbons 28 because of this it is possible to obtain carbon materials with controlled porous texture structural specificity and surface chemistry 29 31 in such a way that all these factors create a synergy to obtain high yields of elimination of contaminants present in water in this sense this research aims to develop a new biocarbon able to be used as adsorbent material for removing atenolol present in water prepared from agro industrial wastes melia azedarach stones commonly known as pride of india were chosen as the precursor for preparing the biocarbon since this specie is abundant in the iberian peninsula being used in gardening as a shade tree for its abundant and aromatic flowering 32 in regions such as south africa and america it is considered an invasive species 33 34 its fruits have narcotic properties and are poisonous to be ingested in quantity so they are considered hazardous waste for humans and other mammals 35 therefore a strategy to reduce and valorize this waste is preparing carbon materials that can be used to provide alternative solutions to environmental and energy issues 36 the present study aimed to synthesize and characterize melia azedarach stones derived carbon material and evaluate its properties as atenolol adsorbent in different water matrices to show its effectiveness in wastewater treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of biocarbon melia azedarach ma fruits were collected from trees on granada university spain campus the stones were cleaned by removing the peel and pulp subsequently were washed with distilled water and dried t 110 c in a second step the carbonization of the material was carried out at 800 c in an inert atmosphere heating rate 10 c min 1 residence time 1 h at 800 c the chemical activation of the material was carried out using the incipient wet impregnation method under an infrared lamp 70 c and using a concentrated solution of koh in a mass ratio of 1 3 material koh the resulting material was carbonized t 800 c for 1 h in an inert atmosphere treated with 1 m hcl and washed with distilled water until the absence of chloride ions in the washing water finally the dried material was milled and sieved to obtain a particle size between 0 074 and 0 250 mm the resulting material was labeled as bioc for comparative purposes a commercial activated carbon norit sae super nsaes lot 94 039 5 salmon cia ac amersfoort the netherlands was chosen denominated in this study as c com 2 2 characterization of the biocarbon the physicochemical properties of the synthesized materials were studied using an environmental scanning electron microscopy esem fei model quanta 400 equipment an elemental analyzer thermo finnigan 1112 series and shimadzu thermobalance model tga 50h the textural properties were studied by obtaining n2 and co2 adsorption isotherms at 196 c and 0 c respectively using an autosorb from quantachrome equipment the surface area sbet of the materials was obtained using the bet equation while the micropore volume w0 and micropore width l0 were obtained using the dr equation finally the total volume of pores v0 95 was considered from the amount of n2 adsorbed at p p0 0 95 and the micropores were calculated from w0 n2 v0 95 100 the dr equation is expressed by w w 0 exp a β e 0 2 where a is the differential molar work a rtln p 0 p w cm3 g 1 is the volume adsorbed as a liquid at an equilibrium relative pressure p 0 p and w 0 cm3 g 1 is the volume of micropores parameters e 0 and b are specific to the adsorbate adsorbent system e 0 is the characteristic energy of adsorption which is inversely proportional to the mean width of the micropores l 0 and b is the adsorbate affinity coefficient in the case of n2 at 196 c b 0 33 and for co2 at 0 c b 0 35 the molar volumes for n2 and co2 at these temperatures are 34 65 cm3 mol 1 and 43 01 cm3 mol 1 respectively finally the mean width of the micropores is determined by l 0 nm 24 e 0 kj mol the functional groups of the bioc were studied employing infrared spectroscopy for which ftir spectra of the sample were obtained before and after the adsorption studies the spectra were obtained using a bruker tensor 27 spectrophotometer between 4000 and 400 cm 1 finally to study the degree of graphitization of the material x ray diffraction xrd experiments were carried out at room temperature with a bruker d8 advance diffractometer at 0 17 min 1 from 10 to 70 2θ 2 3 adsorption studies the adsorption studies were carried out using atenolol molecular weight 266 3 g mol 1 as model molecule which was provided by generis pharmaceutical company and synthesized by kopran research laboratories limited in maharashta india to study the adsorption kinetics 30 ml of atenolol solution c0 120 mg l 1 was added to 6 0 0 2 mg of adsorbent in glass vials these experimental conditions were selected from preliminary studies varying the adsorbent dose around 3 6 mg solution volume 9 30 ml and adsorbate initial concentration 20 180 mg l 1 similarly to that reported previously by 17 the vials were sealed placed in a thermostatic bath at 30 c water bath grant gd100 controller and stirred magnetically at 700 rpm in variomag multipoint equipment samples were collected and after filtration the amount of atenolol remaining in the solution was determined by uv vis spectrophotometry genesys 10s from thermo scientific at 225 nm the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents qt mg g 1 was calculated from a mass balance table s1 to show the versatility of biocarbon synthesized in water treatment processes the adsorption of atenolol was tested in three different aqueous matrices i milli q water 0 mg l 1 caco3 content ii a solution model with high hardness 200 mg l 1 caco3 content and iii tap water from the city of lisbon portugal 80 mg l 1 caco3 content the simulated high hardness water was prepared by dissolving the necessary amount of mgcl2 and cacl2 in milli q water considering a molar ratio ca2 mg2 1 5 the determination of the hardness of the tap water was contrasted with data provided by the empresa portuguesa das aguas livres sa epal of the city of lisbon in june 2016 according to public data the water supplied to the city meets a concentration of caco3 in a range of 40 170 mg l 1 with a mean value of 80 mg l 1 2 3 1 study of the kinetic adsorption models the adsorption rate was studied from the adjustment of the experimental data to the models of pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion table s1 2 3 2 study of the isotherm adsorption models the adsorption isotherms were constructed from the experimental data once equilibrium was reached the experimental data were fitted to the langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models table s1 the range of concentrations studied was 25 a 270 mmol l 1 and the ratio mass of adsorbent volume of solution was the same used in the kinetic studies all kinetic and isotherm adsorption models were tested by performing the adjustment of the experimental data to the non linear equations using as an estimation method the algorithm of levenberg marquardt convergence criterion 1 0 10 6 2 4 studies of degradation of atenolol and reuse of biocarbon for an adsorbent material to be considered promising in water treatment processes it must have a high and rapid adsorption capacity as well as be able to have repeated adsorption desorption cycles with this objective the regeneration of bioc was studied by thermogravimetric analysis studies were carried out using 4 heating rates to evaluate the regeneration energy 10 20 30 y 40 c min 1 the studies were conducted for the original material and saturated with 120 μg l 1 of atenolol in a thermogravimetric analyzer tga shimadzu model tga 50f once the experimental conditions were obtained the material was regenerated and its use was subsequently tested in repeated adsorption desorption cycles for an initial concentration of 120 mg l 1 of atenolol under the same conditions detailed in the previous section 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbent materials the compilation of the results obtained in the characterization of the adsorbent materials by gas physisorption is presented in fig 1c and table 2 it can be seen that the biocarbon prepared from ma stones has an adsorption isotherm type i 37 characteristic of microporous solids however there was an increase in nitrogen adsorption at higher relative pressures after micropore filling indicating the presence of mesopores 38 due to the development of microporosity the material has a high surface area sbet 1230 m2 g 1 1 2 times greater than the one presented c com for the case of bioc the w0 n2 is 0 49 cm3 g 1 and w0 co2 is 0 47 cm3 g 1 that is w0 n2 w0 co2 so that for this material no constrictions in porosity and it can be considered that there is a homogeneous distribution of the size of the micropores contrary to the c com material which presents a very wide distribution in the size of the micropores w0 n2 w0 co2 it is important to highlight that n2 fills the entire volume of micropores while with co2 it is possible to characterize the narrowest micropores 0 7 nm wide due to the foregoing in the discussion of atenolol adsorption results a reference will be made to determining w0 co2 the changes in the morphology during the preparation of the adsorbent material were studied by scanning electron microscopy fig s1 the microphotographs obtained are presented in fig 1a the images for ma showed that the stones are irregular and closed structure as it has no pores on their surface however after the carbonization step ma 800 c the material presents its main characteristic channels with an average diameter of 25 μm finally the activation of the material with koh generated large pores and channels caused by the fracture of the precursor particles bioc fig 1a the results obtained by sem are satisfactorily complemented by the diffractograms obtained for the bioc sample fig 1d the diffraction patterns show a very wide peak around 2θ 23 c and a small one around 2θ 43 c attributable to the 002 and 100 planes of carbon the amplitudes of the peaks show the highly disordered nature of the material however the presence of well defined peaks at 2θ 29 and 40 may be related to inorganic impurities due to the precursor used the ash content and elemental analysis of the bioc are presented in table s2 the ash content of ma stones was very low considerably below than other lignocellulosic waste biomasses used to prepare activated carbon 39 showing that the precursor material is suitable for preparing activated carbon when comparing the results of the elemental analysis of the samples it can be seen that bioc has 4 4 more oxygen than c com most probably due to the synthesis methodology used to identify the oxygenated functional groups present on the surface of the material ft ir infrared spectroscopy studies were carried out fig 1b shows the ft ir spectra corresponding to bioc before the adsorption studies blue and after the regeneration of the material in all cases six main bands are identified the wideband centered at 3413 cm 1 is associated with stretching vibrations of oh bonds due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups 40 the small band around 2360 cm 1 can associate to c single bond o group associated with uncompensated atmospheric co2 41 while the peak near 1660 cm 1 can be attributed to quinone or conjugated ketone 42 the band close to 1620 cm 1 is attributed to vibrations of cc bonds of aromatic groups present in the material 43 at 1384 cm 1 a well defined signal attributable to the ch bond of the aldehyde groups r coh is detectable the small band centered at 1106 cm 1 can be associated with co bonds of hydroxyl groups and ether present in the material 44 finally the signal at 613 cm 1 is associated with c c c bonds characteristic of carbonized materials at high temperatures 3 2 studies of adsorption kinetics the adsorption rate of atenolol in different water matrices was studied using the synthesized biocarbon and compared versus a commercial activated carbon the results are shown in fig 2a b and c and fig s2 previous studies have shown that the critical dimension to favor the diffusion of atenolol towards an active adsorption site is 0 7 nm 17 which is why it is governed mainly by microporosity considering the textural characteristics of the materials it is possible to appreciate that this process is favorable in the case of bioc because it presents an l0 co2 0 72 nm thus no hindrance for its diffusion in the larger microporosity is likely to occur however in the case of c com the process will present difficulties due to the constrictions of the pores l0 co2 0 56 nm in all cases the adsorption process is rapid at the beginning of the process it gradually decreases approaching equilibrium due to the adsorption of atenolol is quickly on the most exposed surface of the material and slowly at the internal sites less accessible for both materials regardless of the type of water used after the first 5 h of the process about 90 of the adsorption capacity is reached the equilibrium is reached at 24 h reaching 94 of the adsorption capacity determined at equilibrium from fig 2a b c and fig s2 weber morris plot it is concluded that two diffusion mechanisms are present for both materials the first is attributable to an external mass transfer so the adsorption at the beginning of the process is fast during the first 5 h of the test on the other hand the second mechanism is attributable to a slower adsorption process after 5 h and until equilibrium is reached since the diffusion of the contaminant takes place internally in the porous texture of the material table 3 shows the kinetic parameters calculated for the tested models for all models acceptable correlation coefficients r were observed however the pseudo second order model is the one that best describes the experimental data since the maximum adsorption capacity calculated by the model qe cal adequately represents the value obtained experimentally qe exp similar results have been reported 17 22 45 which have proposed that the limiting step in the adsorption rate is the interaction of the nh groups of the atenolol molecule with the oxygenated groups present on the surface of the adsorbent material the kinetic constants k2 obtained for bioc are lower than those obtained for c com showing that the synthesized material has a similar performance with the commercial sample the best adsorption results for bioc are attributed to the absence of constrictions in the developed microporosity as previously discussed the type of water matrix used to prepare the atenolol solutions directly affects the removal rate of the pollutant for the bioc sample the kinetic constants obtained are in the order milli q water 0 mg l 1 caco3 content 75 70 g mmol 1 h 1 solution model with high hardness 200 mg l 1 caco3 content 46 18 g mmol 1 h 1 tap water from the city of lisbon portugal 80 mg l 1 caco3 content 42 58 g mmol 1 h 1 which makes it evident that the adsorption rate does not decrease linearly with respect to the hardness of the water due to the above it is proposed that under the conditions studied there will be a phenomenon of adsorption competition between the cations in solution and the atenolol pka 9 6 which will have a positive charge due to the protonation of the amine group which results in the increase of oh species in solution causing the solution ph to be basic in this condition the adsorption phenomenon for both adsorbates ca2 and atenolol are favorable for acidic adsorbents with a high content of oxygenated groups cooh c o oh and o such as bioc similarly to that previously reported by 17 3 3 studies of adsorption equilibrium the experimental data obtained and the adjustment test of the experimental data to the proposed models are presented in fig 2d e and f in contrast the parameters that describe each mathematical model are presented in table 4 the langmuir model is the one that best represents the experimental data with excellent correlation coefficients r 0 98 for all cases likewise the maximum adsorption capacities calculated by the model correctly describe those calculated experimentally the maximum adsorption capacity on average regardless of the type of water used for bioc was always higher compared to c com the difference in adsorption capacity can be discussed based on the adsorption mechanism present in each of the materials for both cases the surface chemistry is similar the oxygenated groups are predominant in both materials but bioc has 4 4 more oxygen content which contributes to the increase in the adsorption capacity as discussed in the previous section in addition it is known that the mechanism of pharmaceutical compounds adsorption onto activated carbons is controlled mainly by the π π interaction between the aromatic rings on the surface and the aromatic ring of the molecule for this reason the surface area occupied by the molecules of atenolol adsorbed satenolol was calculated using the following eq 1 1 s atenolol q m n a a p where q m is the maximum adsorption capacity a p is the projected area of an atenolol molecule 1 26 10 18 m2 molecule 1 and n a is the avogadro s number 6 022 1023 molecules mol 1 the projected area of the atenolol molecule was estimated by multiplying the dimension x 1 8 nm by the dimension y 0 7 nm 17 besides the percentage of surface area occupied by the molecules of atenolol adsorbed was estimated by eq 2 2 s s atenolol s bet x 100 the results obtained were satenolol 1365 m2 g 1 and s 111 for bioc and satenolol 880 m2 g 1 and s 83 5 for c com for bioc the s is slightly higher than 100 which can be attributed to the fact that the adsorbate molecules begin to stack one on top of the other forming multilayers on the other hand for c com there is a 16 5 porosity determined by co2 adsorption to which the atenolol molecule does not have access since the material has narrower microporous table 1 from the above it is possible to conclude that bioc has a higher adsorption capacity with respect to c com due to two mechanisms i the interaction between the oxygenated sites with the nh groups of the atenolol molecule and ii the presence of broad micropores measured by co2 adsorption which allow the atenolol molecule to diffuse throughout the total micropore system of the material allowing it to be adsorbed over the entire surface from the experimental data it can be concluded that the type of water used during the adsorption studies does not significantly affect the adsorption capacity of the materials since all of them are in the same order of magnitude and the small differences observed are within of the experimental error associated with the process bioc 0 06 mmol g 1 and c com 0 08 mmol g 1 in such a way that the presence of cations in solution only has a significant effect on the adsorption rate as discussed above the maximum adsorption capacities obtained were compared against those currently reported in literature table 1 it is appreciated that adsorption capacities of bioc are well above those obtained by different commercial active carbons and biocarbons prepared from pine or tree leaves in addition it has been shown that this does not decay at the time of conducting adsorption studies in water with high hardness content qmax water with 200 ppm caco3 2 00 mmol g 1 or in a tap water of the city of lisbon qmax water with 80 ppm caco3 1 81 mmol g 1 which makes it a promising material to be used in wastewater treatment processes to obtain additional information about the adsorption mechanism the adjustment of the experimental data to the dubinin radushkevich isotherm model was proved from which it is possible to obtain the energy associated with the process e the results obtained are presented in table 4 in which it is also observed that the model can correctly describe the experimental data for all cases regardless of the type of water and adsorbent used the energy associated with the process is 1 kj mol 1 in such a way atenolol adsorption is due to weak bonds associated with physical adsorption the information gathered proposes that the adsorption mechanism consists of a physisorption process between the atenolol molecule and the surface of the adsorbent the atenolol molecule is a secondary amine with an acidity constant pka equal to 9 6 due to which the species in solution are mainly positively charged 45 this condition favors its adsorption in acidic adsorbents with a high content of oxygenated groups cooh c o oh and o such as bioc because at the ph at which the adsorption studies were carried out these are deprotonated generating a negative charge on the surface phpzc 5 0 because of the charge difference between adsorbent adsorbate an attraction occurs due to electrostatic forces resulting in the adsorption of atenolol with weak energy bonds e 1 kj mol 1 in the proposed adsorption mechanism the limiting step in the adsorption rate is the interaction of the nh groups of the atenolol molecule with the oxygenated groups present on the surface of the adsorbent material a graphical representation of adsorption mechanism proposed to atenolol onto bioc is show in supplementary fig 3 in which the speciation diagram of the molecule is shown as well as the functional groups present on the carbon surface for the conditions tested 3 4 studies of degradation of atenolol and reuse of biocarbon the dtg profiles of the thermogravimetric analysis for the saturated samples are presented in fig 3a the results obtained are consistent with a study previously published by 17 who have shown that the first peak of decomposition observed in the lower temperature range can be caused by the desorption of the atenolol molecules weakly adsorbed onto bioc while the two broad decomposition peaks centered at 344 c and 403 c are attributable to the thermal degradation of two forms of atenolol as it must be considered that as many other pharmaceuticals it is present as a racemic mixture in the dtg profiles a shoulder is observed between 163 c and 275 c which can be attributed to the release of nh3 and isopropylamine due to the decomposition of the atenolol molecule 46 for this reason it is proposed that ammonia isopropylamine and some compounds containing carbonyl isocyanate and methyl groups are released into the atmosphere during the thermal decomposition of atenolol these suggestions are directly related to the chemical structure of atenolol and complement the studies previously reported by silva et al 47 the original biocarbon presents a low thermal degradation since after the thermal treatment maintains 83 36 4 55 on average of its initial weight the saturated samples show more significant weight losses 30 on average during the heat treatment compared to the original material the energy associated with the regeneration desorption of the material ereg as well as the arrhenius factor a were calculated from the maximum peaks observed in the dtg profile in a similar way to that reported by 17 the results obtained are presented in table s3 and are consistent with those previously reported from the above information it was decided to use a temperature of 450 c 723 k to perform the bioc regeneration because at this temperature according to de dtg data previously discuss almost all the atenolol adsorbed in the material has been eliminated once the material was used in the first adsorption cycle it was recovered and dried at 60 c for 24 h then it was introduced to a steel furnace and subjected to a treatment of 450 c in an inert atmosphere nitrogen flow of 5 cm3 min 1 at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 and a residence time of 1 h at the programmed temperature the regenerated material was characterized by ftir spectroscopy and the results obtained show the elimination of atenolol has been achieved since no new absorption bands that could be attributed to this compound are seen in the ft ir spectra another important detail to note is that the heat treatment does not damage the functional groups of the material since the bands at 3413 2360 1384 y 1106 cm 1 due to the r oh and r coh groups remain unchanged however the textural properties of material do show significant changes since the bet area decreases by 1230 to 1015 m2 g 1 as well as the volume of pores 0 49 cm3 g 1 to 0 38 cm3 g 1 which could be because the thermal treatment modifies the texture of the carbon due to the generation of constrictions in the pores resulting in low accessibility to the porosity of the original material additionally x ray diffraction studies were carried out on the material after the thermal regeneration process fig 1d the results show that the treatment does not modify the amorphous nature of the material since the material presents the same diffraction pattern as the original material after the regeneration of the material the number of cycles of adsorption desorption of the bioc to be completely exhausted was evaluated one way to predict this behavior is to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the atenolol in repeated cycles of adsorption desorption and to make an adjustment of the experimental data obtained to the model proposed by 48 to evaluate the useful life of an adsorbent material eq 3 3 q e q o k l n where q o mg g 1 is the initial adsorption capacity n is the number of adsorption desorption cycles that the adsorbent material can have and k l is the life factor of the adsorbent per cycle the data obtained are presented in fig 3b after the mathematical analysis of the model it is concluded that the biocarbon can provide up to 4 cycles of adsorption desorption until completely exhausted the post regeneration characterization studies of the material showed that the adsorption capacity depletion is due to the fact that the heat treatment used during the regeneration damages the textural properties of the material decreasing the bet surface area sbet bioc 1230 m2 g 1 vs sbet bioc reg 1015 m2 g 1 in the same order magnitude in which the capacity of adsorption decreases qmax 1st cycle 1 79 mmol g 1 vs 1 qmax 2nd cycle 1 3 mmol g 1 the above information proves that the adsorption mechanism is due to the formation of a monolayer on the surface of the adsorbent due to π π interactions between the atenolol ring and the pseudo graphitic planes of the material with an associated binding energy of e 1 kj mol 1 for this reason there is a linear relationship between the bet area of the material and its adsorption capacity as shown by the experimental data fig 4 4 conclusions the results obtained in this research work show an innovative alternative to solve the current challenges presented by the removal of emerging contaminants present in the water it has been shown that through a physicochemical treatment it is possible to synthesize a carbon material from melia azedarach stones with high atenolol adsorption capacities 2 0 mmol g 1 which are preserved regardless of the type of matrix containing the contaminant thus a strategy of thermal degradation of the contaminant has also been demonstrated once it has been captured in the solid the proposed alternative manages to eliminate the contaminant and does not significantly affect the adsorption capacity of the material in such a

12842,in order to evaluate comprehensively the impact of calcium peroxide cp on anaerobic digestion ad of primary sludge p sludge and secondary sludge s sludge of anaerobic anoxic aerobic process a series of batch experiments were conducted in the lab scale results showed that cp pretreatment could kill fecal coliform completely in 72 0 h and promote the solubilization of s sludge more significantly than p sludge compared with the control the maximum ch4 production potential and the maximum specific ch4 production rate of p sludge ad only increased by 11 2 and 6 10 respectively but those of s sludge ad increased by 40 7 and 58 4 after the same pretreatment indicating that cp pretreatment was more conducive to methane production of s sludge moreover the increase of alkalinity and initial acetate concentration of s sludge was greater than that of p sludge after pretreatment according to the process analysis of hydrolysis notably cp pretreatment reduced the po4 3 p concentration and chromaticity in the ad supernatant of both sludges which was beneficial to the subsequent treatment of biogas slurry in addition cp pretreatment increased the content of total nutrient and decreased the content of harmful heavy metals in both biogas residues conclusively compared with p sludge cp pretreatment is more suitable for s sludge ad this work firstly provides a comprehensive evaluation of cp pretreatment to waste sludge produced in anaerobic anoxic aerobic process of wastewater treatment plant wwtp which is of great significance in enriching the pretreatment technology of waste sludge and promoting the application of cp pretreatment in wwtp graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion calcium peroxide pretreatment primary sludge secondary sludge digestate data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction with the increase in population and acceleration of industrialization and urbanization anthropological activities generate vast amounts of wastewater wastewater is rich in carbon nitrogen and phosphorus leading to severe eutrophication or even black and smelly problem in many receiving water ecosystems when discharged directly 1 the early secondary treatment of municipal wastewater only required removal of organic matter with the reduction in water environment reception capacity the discharge standard of the wastewater treatment plant has become increasingly strict it requires the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater obligatorily anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process is widely used in china and even worldwide because of its good effect of nitrogen and phosphorus removal 2 the sludge produced from a2 o process mainly consists of primary sludge p sludge and secondary sludge s sludge which have different properties the former has high content of easily degradable organic matter and pathogenic bacteria whereas the latter has high content of nitrogen and phosphorus but is difficult to degrade 3 these sludges not only have a huge output but are also abundant in pollutants and pathogens thereby causing various environmental problems with inappropriate treatment therefore how to treat sludge safely and minimize the adverse effects of sludge on human health and the environment have become an urgent problem 4 the optimal goals of sludge treatment are stabilization harmlessness reduction and resource utilization which can be achieved synchronously through anaerobic digestion ad however sludge hydrolysis is usually the limiting step of sludge anaerobic digestion to produce methane 5 6 many pretreatment methods have been studied to accelerate methane production including thermal pretreatment ultrasonic pretreatment anaerobic or aerobic pre digestion alkali pretreatment etc 7 8 among the sludge pretreatment technologies mentioned above thermal pretreatment can significantly promote sludge hydrolysis but requires high energy consumption and does not always yield positive results ultrasonic pretreatment is easy to operate but its high cost limits the application in china anaerobic or aerobic pre digestion is cheap but the optimal conditions for microbial activity are difficult to control alkali pretreatment requires additional dosing of chemicals and there is a risk of chemical pollution due to calcium peroxide cp has the advantages of strong oxidizing property good thermal stability and available alkaline condition it has been put forward to treat sludge in recent years 9 being a solid inorganic peroxide cp can not only generate free radicals i e oh and o2 that decompose sludge cell walls to release extracellular polymers and intracellular substances but also produce ca oh 2 to improve the sludge hydrolysis 10 11 due to this property cp was proposed as an additive for sludge pretreatment to enhance methanogenic performance wang et al 12 studied the effect of cp on the ad of s sludge and elucidated that cp pretreatment enhanced methane production by promoting the degradation of refractory substances in the s sludge in addition it has also been confirmed that cp pretreatment combined with other technologies can promote methanogenesis of s sludge zhang et al 13 found that the combination of cp pretreatment and zero valent iron can significantly promote the ad of s sludge and the methane production was increased by 9 70 and 13 8 compared with sole cp pretreatment or zero valent iron addition reactors respectively wang et al 14 combined cp with microwave to pretreat s sludge and found that the optimal pretreatment condition was cp 0 100 g g volatile suspended solids microwave 480 w 2 00 min for sludge methane production notably the previous studies mainly focused on s sludge by cp and the differential effects of cp pretreatment on p sludge and s sludge ad system are still unclear in addition from the perspective of environmental and health risks the effect of cp pretreatment on sludge pathogen removal is an important issue because the direct landfill of dewatered sludge normally occupies a certain share of sludge disposal in many regions and countries 15 16 however the effect of cp pretreatment on the pathogen removal efficiency of different sludges especially on the p sludge with high pathogen content has rarely been reported moreover the effect of cp on the properties of biogas residue and slurry usually affects the further disposal or utilization after sludge anaerobic digestion but is few nowadays this work studied the effect of cp pretreatment on the properties and fecal coliform numbers of p sludge and s sludge initially furthermore the differences in the hydrolysis and methane production of both sludges in anaerobic digestion after cp pretreatment were evaluated finally the effect of cp pretreatment on the properties of biogas residue and slurry after anaerobic digestion of both sludges was assessed this work evaluated the impact of cp pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of p sludge and s sludge comprehensively broadened the understanding of cp pretreatment on sludge treatment and disposal in wastewater treatment plants which would undoubtedly enrich the treatment and disposal technologies of waste sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludges and inoculum p sludge and s sludge used were respectively collected from the primary and secondary sedimentation tanks of xi an no 4 wastewater treatment plant which adopted a2 o process to treat municipal wastewater of five hundred thousand cubic meters per day the inoculated sludge was collected from a laboratory scale anaerobic reactor 35 0 1 0 c and domesticated for a period to avoid the influence of sludge solid content on pretreatment effect and enhance the test comparability between different sludges the method of gravity concentration or dilution with deionized water was used to adjust the solid content of p sludge and s sludge the main parameters of both sludges for pretreatment and inoculum for ad are presented in table s1 2 2 experimental design and setup 2 2 1 pretreatment of p sludge and s sludge with cp four serum bottles with a working volume of 250 ml were used for cp pretreatment of p sludge and s sludge initially 125 ml of p sludge and 125 ml of s sludge as shown in table s1 were placed into two serum bottles without cp addition and numbered as p ck and s ck respectively then some cp were added to the two other serum bottles into which 125 ml of p sludge and 125 ml of s sludge were placed in advance and numbered as p cp and s cp respectively the cp dosage in p cp and s cp was 0 140 g cao2 g vs which referred to the results of wang et al 12 the time and temperature of pretreatment in all reactors were set to 72 0 h and 25 0 c respectively 2 2 2 anaerobic digestion experiment of both sludges pretreated with cp anaerobic digestion experiment was carried out to evaluate the anaerobic digestion performance of p sludge and s sludge pretreated with cp which was carried out with a series of different working volume serum bottles including 100 ml for gas analysis and 250 ml for hydrolysis analysis for the hydrolysis analysis the sludge and inoculum were added to each reactor to obtain a mixture of 240 ml with a ratio of 1 i e vsinoculum vssludge after completing the pretreatment operation described in 2 2 1 the reactor used for gas production analysis was performed the same as the hydrolysis analysis to obtain a mixture of 60 0 ml sludge and inoculum with three parallel sets for each group blank experiments with inoculum only were performed to remove the biogas produced from the inoculation sludge the ph in all the reactors was adjusted to 7 00 0 10 by hcl naoh 2 00 mol l all the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 2 00 min to ensure anaerobic environment before being sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in a 35 0 1 0 c air bath shaker 140 rpm the reactors were sequentially numbered as p ck ad p cp ad s ck ad and s cp ad corresponding to their respective pretreatment conditions 2 3 sample and analytical methods in the test of cp pretreatment the dissolved chemical oxygen demand scod in different sludges was measured every 24 0 h and the changes in soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide were measured initially and at the end of test the biodegradability of organics released in the liquor phase was analyzed using excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy hitachi f 7000 japan meanwhile the number of fecal coliform before and after pretreatment was measured by determination method for municipal sludge in wastewater treatment plant wwtp cj t 221 2005 by china with its unit being colony forming units cfu g ts 17 tcod and scod were measured by potassium dichromate method 18 and soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide were measured via lowry folin and phenol sulfuric methods respectively 19 20 in ad experiment the biogas production was determined daily by using a calibrated glass syringe the biogas was collected every five days and its composition was analyzed by gc agilent6890n tcd and tdx 01 liquid samples 10 0 ml were collected from the serum bottle once every five days for determination the ph was determined using a lightning magnetic ph meter phs 3c then the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 0 min and 2 00 ml of the supernatant was obtained to determine the alkalinity by acid base titration an amount of 1 ml of the supernatant was passed through a cellulose acetate filter with pore size of 0 220 μm and 50 0 μl of formic acid was added to adjust the ph to 2 0 then gc agilent 6890 n fid was used to measure volatile fatty acids vfas the remaining supernatant was passed through a cellulose acetate filter with pore size of 0 450 μm for measurement of soluble parameters including scod total ammonia nitrogen tan and po4 3 p the concentrations of scod tan and po4 3 p were measured by potassium dichromate method nessler s reagent colorimetric and molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometric method respectively 18 at the end of ad experiment the samples obtained from the serum bottles were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 00 min and then filtered through 0 450 μm cellulose acetate membrane the supernatant was collected as biogas slurry and the concentrate was collected as biogas residue the ph chromaticity total nitrogen tn nh4 n total phosphorus tp po4 3 p chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 of biogas slurry were measured by the standard methods 18 olympus handheld xrf analyzer vanta shanghai zequan instruments was used to determine the metal content of biogas residues the determination methods of tp tn and total potassium tk in biogas residues were referred from han et al 21 in addition ts and vs were determined by gravimetric method 18 all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the data are displayed in the form of arithmetic mean standard deviation 2 4 processing parameters and analysis the lag phase time λ and the maximum methane production potential p 0 were calculated according to the modified gompertz model eq 1 as follows 22 1 p p 0 exp exp r max e p 0 λ t 1 where p ml g vs is the cumulative ch4 yield at time t e is exp 1 2 72 r max ml g vs day is the maximum specific ch4 production rate p 0 ml g vs is the maximum ch4 production potential and λ day is the lag phase time the parameters in this equation p 0 r max and λ are estimated using the nonlinear fitting of origin 2017 the free ammonia nitrogen fan concentration was calculated in accordance with the actual ph and temperature using eq 2 as follows 23 2 fan tan 1 10 ph 10 0 09018 2729 92 t k 1 where tan mg l is the total ammonia concentration fan mg l is the free ammonia nitrogen concentration t k is the kelvin temperature the sludge disintegration rate sdcod was calculated according to eq 3 as follows 3 sd cod c scod after c scod 0 c tcod 0 c scod 0 100 where c scodafter mg l is the final scod concentration after the sludge was pretreated c scod0 mg l is the initial scod concentration before the sludge was pretreated c tcod0 mg l is the initial tcod concentration in the sludge before pretreatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cp pretreatment on organic matter and fecal coliform of sludge 3 1 1 effects of pretreatment on organic matter of sludge 1 effect of pretreatment on scod soluble proteins and polysaccharides of sludge fig s1 illustrates the effects of cp pretreatment on the concentration of scod soluble proteins and polysaccharides in p sludge and s sludge as shown in fig s1 a the time course of scod concentration in both sludges was very similar it increased sharply after 24 0 h and then maintained a slight increase trend until 72 0 h scod concentration increased from 123 10 mg l to 3192 61 mg l in p sludge after pretreatment for 72 0 h whereas it increased from 351 25 mg l to 3315 79 mg l in s sludge resulting in sdcod of p sludge and s sludge of 11 6 and 11 8 respectively fig s1 b shows that the concentrations of soluble protein and polysaccharide in p ck were almost unchanged and that s ck slightly increased after 72 0 h however 72 0 h of cp pretreatment caused the concentrations of soluble protein and polysaccharide in p cp to increase by 7 00 and 15 2 times respectively whereas those in s cp increased by 8 83 and 15 3 times respectively therefore cp pretreatment acutely promoted sludge dissolution the results showed that cp pretreatment significantly enhanced the concentration of scod soluble proteins and polysaccharides in both sludges this finding may be due to the fact that cp can react with water to generate ca oh 2 and free radicals h2o2 oh and o2 wang et al 24 proposed that h2o2 is a strong chemical oxidant that can damage the cell wall of microorganisms leading to the release of cytoplasm similarly erden et al 25 pointed out that oh and o2 can attack the cell wall of microorganisms and oxidize it into dissolved organic matter moreover ca oh 2 can cause lipid saponification in the cell wall leading to the dissolution of solid organic matter 26 although high concentrations of ca2 introduced by pretreatment was not beneficial to sludge dissolution h2o2 oh o2 and alkali were documented to enhance sludge disintegration largely meanwhile it can be observed that the impact of cp pretreatment on s sludge was slightly larger than that on p sludge which may be due to the differences of the properties between p sludge and s sludge for s sludge microbial cell i e including extracellular polymers and intracellular substances is the main component and source of scod which is difficult to dissolve inherently 27 however the source of scod in p sludge is particulate organic matter that is easy to decompose inherently although cp had a certain influence on p sludge the degree of influence was smaller than that on s sludge in general cp pretreatment provided more soluble organic matter for the subsequent digestion stages of p sludge and s sludge but had a greater impact on s sludge 2 changes in soluble organic matter in sludge pretreated with cp to examine whether cp pretreatment caused degradations of the recalcitrant organic 3d fluorescence analysis was used to analyze the effect of cp pretreatment on the content and types of soluble organic substances in sludge eem spectrum and fluorescence of organic matter released from different reactors after 72 0 h of cp pretreatment are shown in fig 1 as shown in figs 1 a b tryptophan like substances tp soluble microbial by product like substances smp and humic acid like substances ha appeared in p sludge and s sludge without cp from figs 1 c d it can be seen that no new fluorescence peaks were generated in both sludges after cp pretreatment and the original fluorescence peaks of tp and ha were quenched only leaving the changed fluorescence intensity of smp the fluorescence intensity of smp in p cp increased by 32 7 times after cp pretreatment compared with that in p ck while it was increased by 40 0 times in s cp compared with that in s ck zhang et al 13 showed that oh and o2 produced by cp during pretreatment were beneficial to the degradation of refractory substances in the s sludge thereby increasing the content of easily degradable substances these results showed that cp pretreatment was more conducive to the dissolution of easily degradable substances in the s sludge compared with p sludge 3 1 2 effects of cp pretreatment on the number of fecal coliform in p sludge and s sludge being one of the most familiar hygienic indicators the number of fecal coliform was used in this study to describe the effects of cp pretreatment on both sludges as shown in table 1 it can be seen that the number of fecal coliform in p sludge was larger than that in s sludge initially after 72 0 h the number of fecal coliform in unpretreated p sludge and s sludge was 5 28 0 15 105 cfu g ts and 2 34 0 09 105 cfu g ts which decreased by 89 9 and 86 4 respectively however the cp pretreatment resulted in a 100 inactivation rate of fecal coliform in each sludge where the number of fecal coliform reached the requirement of sludge quality from municipal wwtp gb 24188 2009 and standard for sludge stabilization treatment of municipal wwtp cj t 510 2017 by china 28 29 this result was superior to other pretreatment technologies reported in previous studies liu et al 30 found only free ammonia treatment 560 mg nh3 n l combined with ad could meet the requirement for class a biosolids usepa 1994 and wang et al 31 showed that ultrasonic pretreatment could not inactivate fecal coliform at the frequency and power density of 20 0 khz and 2 50 w ml respectively although ad can remove a certain number of pathogens 32 cp pretreatment can effectively inactivate pathogenic bacteria of sludge which undoubtedly provide a simple effective and safe pretreatment method when the sludge is landfilled directly without ad 3 2 effects of cp pretreatment on ad of p sludge and s sludge 3 2 1 biogas production 1 daily and cumulative biogas production fig 2 demonstrates the effects of cp pretreatment on the daily biogas production and cumulative biogas production of both sludges during ad as shown in fig 2 a the daily biogas production of p sludge was evidently higher than that of s sludge during the whole ad process which may attribute to that most organic matter in the p sludge is easily degradable and can be degraded by hydrolyzing bacteria 33 whereas the microbial cell walls in the s sludge are mostly refractory organic substances 34 the results in section 3 1 showed that pretreatment provided more soluble organic matter for microorganisms especially s sludge therefore it can be found that the average daily biogas production of s cp ad in the first 7 days reached 16 16 0 46 ml g vs d which was higher than 10 30 0 68 ml g vs d of s ck ad meanwhile the pretreatment increased the average daily biogas production from 18 39 0 63 ml g vs d in p ck ad to 21 29 0 53 ml g vs d in p cp ad on days 7 to 11 all these results demonstrated that cp pretreatment mainly affected the biogas production in the early stage of sludge especially for s sludge in the later stage of ad the daily biogas productions of all groups showed declining trend due to the decrease in available organic matter but the daily biogas productions of the pretreatment groups were still slightly higher than that of the control groups only on the 21st and 23rd days the daily biogas production of s cp ad was lower than that of s ck ad from fig 2 b it is observed that the curve of cumulative biogas production with cp pretreatment was evidently higher than that without cp pretreatment by the end of ad the cumulative biogas production of p cp ad and s cp ad reached 432 10 and 185 9 ml g vs respectively which were increased by 6 77 and 35 1 compared with the corresponding control group noticeably cp had a better effect on improving the biogas production performance of s sludge which was consistent with the previous pretreatment results therefore cp increased significantly the cumulative biogas production of s sludge but had a limited effect on p sludge 2 average content of biogas components the biogas component contents of ad process in different reactors are presented in table 2 it can be observed that cp pretreatment could increase ch4 content in the biogas thereby enhancing ch4 content in the biogas from 68 6 in p ck ad and 55 5 in s ck ad to 70 0 in p cp ad and 59 4 in s cp ad however cp pretreatment reduced co2 content in the biogas the co2 content of p ck ad s ck ad p cp ad and s cp ad was 23 9 23 7 22 3 and 19 3 respectively fu et al 35 showed that ca oh 2 generated by cp can partially fix co2 in biogas in situ through the reaction of ca oh 2 co2 caco3 h2o which reduced the amount of biogas but increased its ch4 content because biogas is mainly composed of ch4 and co2 noticeably although cp increased 3 85 ch4 content in the biogas of s sludge on the average it was still lower than that in the biogas of the p sludge group which may result from the relatively high carbon nitrogen ratio in the p sludge 36 in addition the average n2 content in s ck ad was 20 74 which was higher than that in p ck ad 7 57 the difference may lie in the presence of nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the s sludge which could produce more n2 in the early stage of ad due to oxygen supply from cp resulting in higher average n2 in the biogas 37 table 2 also showed that the average n2 content of s ck ad was only 1 4 higher than that of s cp ad indicating that the bacteria related to nitrogen conversion may be able to survive partially under cp pretreatment although cp could release oh o2 and alkali in general cp pretreatment could increase ch4 contents in the biogas of both sludges and the promotion effect on s sludge was more significant 3 fitting results using the modified gompertz equation the relevant parameters fitted by the modified gompertz equation are summarized in table 3 it is obvious that r2 of each group was greater than 0 990 indicating that the model fitted the data very well the inoculum used in this experiment was obtained under the condition of mesophilic ad thus the λ of each group was less than 0 100 it also indicated that cp pretreatment slightly affected the λ of both sludges in addition the p 0 and r max of p cp ad clearly increased by 11 2 and 6 10 respectively when compared with those of p ck ad whereas the p 0 and r max of the s cp ad group increased by 40 7 and 58 4 respectively when compared with those of s ck ad reflecting that cp pretreatment had greater influence on s sludge than p sludge in the p 0 and r max of ad these results showed that cp pretreatment can not only improve the methanogenesis potential of sludge to supplement the energy consumption of sewage treatment plants but significantly increase its methanogenesis rate to reduce the sludge residence time thereby reducing the capital cost especially s sludge 3 2 2 hydrolysis processes 1 time course of scod and po4 3 p concentration fig 3 indicates the evolution of scod and po4 3 p concentration in the liquid phase during ad process as shown in fig 3 a the scod concentrations of the control groups p ck ad and s ck ad reached the maximum value on the fifth day of ad indicating that the first 5 days of ad was the hydrolysis and acidification stage for the control groups from then on the dissolution rate of scod slowed down and the gas generation stage continued thus the consumption rate of scod was greater than the dissolution rate resulting in a gradual decrease in the concentration of scod on the 15th day of ad the cumulative methane production of p ck ad and s ck ad reached 331 5 ml g vs and 110 7 ml g vs respectively after day 15 the scod concentration showed an increasing trend as the gas production rate decreased different from the control groups the scod concentrations of the pretreatment groups p cp ad and s cp ad reached the maximum initially and showed a downward trend in the early stage of ad indicating that more soluble organic matter was accumulated in the pretreated sludges due to cp introduction initially and then was immediately utilized to produce biogas at the beginning as shown in fig 2 a this finding reflected that cp pretreatment mainly promoted incipient ad methanogenesis however the scod concentrations of s cp ad and p cp ad increased to another high value on the 20th day of ad li et al 38 pointed out that in addition to being consumed by microbial metabolism during gasification scod may also be oxidized by h2o2 released from cp h2o2 could not play a role in the second high value of scod in this experiment because the biogas production curves were very similar for the sludges with and without cp pretreatment demonstrating that the methanogenesis was unaffected by the strong chemical oxidant the only possibility was that cp pretreatment partly destroyed the insoluble organic matters which underwent a period of 20 days to converse into scod therefore the late accumulation of scod in s sludge seemed to result from indirect cp pretreatment previous studies reported that cp promoted the release of scod during sludge ad but the effect of adding cp on po4 3 p release was rarely discussed fig 3 b shows the time course of po4 3 p concentration in the supernatant of different sludges it shows that the average po4 3 p concentration was 27 4 5 83 55 0 and 12 8 mg l in the supernatant of p ck ad p cp ad s ck ad and s cp ad respectively evidently adding cp inhibited the release of po4 3 p comparing with control group huang et al 39 found that cp would produce ca oh 2 which could react with po4 3 p to ca10 po4 6 oh 2 and other precipitates transferring the orthophosphate in the liquid phase to the solid phase however ahn et al 40 showed that the presence of alkali accelerated the release of phosphate during sludge ad process therefore the reduced concentration of po4 3 p in the pretreated sludges indicated that the precipitation rate of po4 3 p was greater than the release rate of po4 3 p in this study it also found that with or without cp the po4 3 p concentration in p sludge was obviously lower than that in s sludge which was ascribed to the cell body of microorganism dominated in s sludge hydrolysis caused the lysis of microorganism cell which led to the release of phosphorus from the cell to the liquid phase 19 in addition a large amount of polyphosphate would be released when the cell body was ruptured because the s sludge was obtained from an a2 o system and contained a higher proportion of polyphosphorus bacteria in general cp pretreatment could evidently reduce the phosphate concentration in the supernatant of p sludge and s sludge which was beneficial to subsequent treatment of digestive slurry 2 time course of vfas concentration fig 4 shows the evolution of vfas concentration in the liquid phase during ad organic acids are available substrates for the biogas production stage of methanogens when the organic acids are consumed faster the biogas is also produced more rapidly as shown in fig 4 a the total vfas tvfas concentration of p sludge and s sludge on day 0 of ad were 126 mg l and 87 1 mg l respectively which was lower than previous studies 41 this could be ascribed to the sludge used in this study was low vs ts which had a long sludge age and was sampled in the rainy season the concentration of tvfas in p ck ad reached a maximum of 206 12 mg l on the fifth day and then decreased to 27 6 2 8 mg l on day 10 on the contrary the concentration of tvfas in s ck ad decreased from 87 1 5 4 mg l on day 0 to 0 000 0 000 mg l on the 10th day this finding was consistent with the change in daily biogas production fig 2 a comparatively p sludge produced more vfas than s sludge mainly because p sludge contained a great deal of biodegradable organic matters whereas the microbial cells with inert cell membranes and walls were mainly composed of s sludge leading to the slow hydrolysis and acidification of s sludge 42 43 however the concentrations of tvfas in p cp ad and s cp ad showed a downward trend in the early stage of ad and the sludge after pretreatment had a high initial soluble organic concentration the organic matter in the sludge was rapidly utilized by microorganisms at the beginning of anaerobic reaction indicating that pretreatment mainly promoted methane production in the early stage of ad in addition the concentrations of vfas in all groups were dominated by acetate and propionate but the acetate concentrations were affected significantly by cp pretreatment the concentration of acetate in p ck ad and s ck ad on the 0th day was 120 4 and 52 3 2 7 mg l respectively the value increased to 298 6 and 255 3 mg l in p cp ad and s cp ad respectively representing an increase by 1 48 and 3 87 times acetate is well known as the main digestion substrate of methanogens in this study acetate could be provided by cp pretreatment and further be converted to produce more methane this result was partly attributed to cp providing a certain amount of o2 in the early stage of ad lim et al 44 showed that limited aeration can convert other vfas into acetic acid the alkali produced by the reaction of cp with water might also play an important role in the change in the concentration of vfas su et al 45 treated s sludge with ca oh 2 and obtained high concentration of acetic acid but the concentration of other vfas decreased ping et al 46 found that the addition of cp increased the acetate yield during the fermentation process and the acetic acid concentration increased significantly with the extension of the fermentation time therefore the differences in sludge properties decreased the concentrations of vfa components in s sludge compared with that in p sludge and the presence of cp was beneficial to acetate productions in different sludges especially for s sludge 3 time course of ph alkalinity and the concentration of tan and fan fig 5 shows the time course of ph alkalinity and the concentration of tan and fan in each reactor from figs 5 a and 5 b it can be observed that the ph values and alkalinity concentrations in all groups gradually increased with time but the ph values and alkalinity concentrations in the pretreatment groups were higher than those in the control groups due to the reaction between ca oh 2 generated by cp and co2 to form caco3 meanwhile cp pretreatment promoted the generation of alkaline substances such as ammonia nitrogen even if more organic acids were generated the system still showed higher alkalinity and ph 47 shen et al 48 pointed out that the optimal alkalinity for stable operation of ad was 2000 3000 mgcaco3 l in this study the addition of cp was beneficial to improve the buffer capacity of the system and maintain the alkalinity in an appropriate range notably the alkalinity of s cp ad maintained the highest concentration during the whole ad process which may be the reason why cp pretreatment promotes higher efficiency of methane production of s sludge than p sludge unfortunately the ph of s cp ad increased to 7 96 0 06 on the 20th day which may affect the consumption of organic matter by the methanogenesis process 49 this phenomenon was consistent with the previous results that is the concentrations of scod and vfas in s cp ad restarted to accumulate on the 20th day as shown in fig 5 c tan concentrations in the pretreated sludges were higher than those in the unpretreated sludges due to the advanced oxidation of cp and the action of ca oh 2 resulting in the further hydrolysis of proteins and the release of more ammonia nitrogen noticeably the curve of tan concentrations in pretreated s sludge was the highest because s sludge is mainly composed of activated sludge flocs with microorganisms as the skeleton and contains more insoluble proteins that can release a large amount of ammonia nitrogen during the hydrolysis process therefore at the end of the experiment the tan concentration in s cp ad was 840 22 mg l which was higher than that in s ck ad 648 25 mg l as well as p cp ad 682 23 mg l since the concentration of fan is related to tan ph and temperature fig 5 d shows that the change trend of fan concentration was similar to that of tan and ph in this experiment however the fan concentration of s cp ad increased rapidly on the 20th day similar to ph in fig 5 a and scod in fig 3 a yenigün and demirel 50 found that fan concentration exceeding 600 mg l would lead to unstable methane production whereas the highest concentration of fan in s cp ad was only 66 9 2 3 mg l in this study indicating that cp pretreatment would not cause the instability in ad systems of both sludges in conclusion cp pretreatment enhanced the ph values and alkalinity concentrations as well as the concentrations of tan and fan for p sludge and s sludge but those in s sludge pretreated by cp were the highest 3 3 effects of cp pretreatment on the properties of biogas residue and slurry 3 3 1 properties of biogas residue in different sludge ad the effects of cp pretreatment on the properties of biogas residue after ad of p sludge and s sludge are shown in table s2 it is found that the total nutrient content i e tn tp and tk of p ck ad p cp ad s ck ad and s cp ad biogas residues was 5 45 0 19 5 52 0 25 6 52 0 28 and 6 78 0 34 respectively this result indicated that the total nutrient contents in all biogas residues could satisfy exceed 5 00 of the total nutrient content as required for ny525 2012 standard of the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 51 notably the total nutrient content in the residue of s sludge was higher than that of p sludge which was determined by the differences in their properties and similar to the finding of peng et al 52 moreover cp pretreatment increased the total nutrient contents of the two sludge biogas residues evidently this was due to the precipitation reaction between ca2 and phosphate in the supernatant of cp pretreatment group which increased the tp content in the residue table s2 also shows that in addition to as the contents of heavy metals in all biogas residues could satisfy b level in the chinese national standard for the control of pollutants in agricultural sludge gb 4284 2018 53 although the content of calcium ca in biogas residue of p cp ad and s cp ad were 70 9 and 104 higher than that of p ck ad and s ck ad respectively the contents of other harmful heavy metals ni pb cu as and zn except for cr in biogas residues of p cp ad and s cp ad were slightly lower than those of p ck ad and s ck ad this finding may be attributed to cao2 induced peroxidation that could destroy the combination of extracellular polymers and metal ions in sludge thereby promoting the release of heavy metals from sludge to the water phase 54 naserian et al reported that the end product of digestion might be not fully stabilized and required further treatment 55 however cp pretreatment in this study not only increased the total nutrient contents but decreased the heavy metal contents in the two sludge biogas residues which was of great significance for the utilization of residues in farmland 3 3 2 properties of biogas slurry in different sludge ad the effects of cp pretreatment on the properties of digested slurry in different sludge ad are shown in table s3 it is clearly observed that the cp pretreatment reduced evidently the chroma tp and po4 3 p concentrations in the two sludge biogas slurries chroma tp and po4 3 p concentrations in the biogas slurry of p sludge were reduced by 54 5 77 7 and 88 9 respectively compared with p ck ad whereas those in the biogas slurry of s sludge decreased by 40 0 60 5 and 79 1 compared with s ck ad meanwhile cp pretreatment increased the nitrogen and cod concentrations of the slurries in both sludges however cp pretreatment increased bod5 concentration in the slurry of p sludge but decreased that of s sludge in summary cp could improve the chroma and reduce the phosphorus concentration in the biogas slurry of p sludge and s sludge but it could increase the concentrations of ammonia and cod in the two sludge biogas slurries 3 4 implications this study firstly evaluated the difference in the effect of cp pretreatment on the ad of p sludge and s sludge in terms of sludge properties methane production and digestate for disposal this work demonstrated that cp pretreatment was more favorable for s sludge than s sludge compared with the control cp pretreatment with 0 140 g g vs increased the methane production of s sludge by 40 7 which was higher than that of fenton pretreatment 15 0 56 alkaline pretreatment 29 6 57 and ultrasonic pretreatment 31 0 58 apart from methane production cp pretreatment also effectively enhanced stubborn organic matter degradation pathogen removal and final disposal of s sludge li et al 59 first proposed the concept of nutrient removal energy recovery for the operation of a wwtp using cp as sludge pretreatment compared with the pretreatment method of thermal hydrolysis that is currently widely used in china cp pretreatment can improve the rate of sludge crushed under normal temperature conditions with lower energy consumption but obtain methane production equivalent to thermal hydrolysis 60 it should be also noted that the above discussion is only based on the laboratory scale study and pilot scale or full scale research is needed urgently in the future 4 conclusions in this study the effects of cp pretreatment on the dissolution of p sludge and s sludge the number of fecal coliform the mesophilic ad performance and the properties of digested residue and slurry were evaluated synthetically the results showed that cp pretreatment could promote the degradation of some refractory organic matters in both sludges especially for s sludge meanwhile cp pretreatment could kill fecal coliform in 72 0 h in ad process compared with p sludge cp pretreatment increased the methane production of s sludge more significantly which could increase p 0 and r max of s sludge ad increased by 40 7 and 58 4 than the control respectively this finding may be due to that cp pretreatment increased the alkalinity and initial acetic acid concentration of s sludge by higher multiple than p sludge notably cp pretreatment reduced on the average by 78 7 and 76 7 of po4 3 p concentration in the supernatant of p sludge and s sludge compared with the control group respectively resulting in an increased p content in the digested residue and a decreased p concentration in the digested slurry finally cp pretreatment further increased the content of total nutrient and ca in both biogas residues but reduced the content of harmful heavy metals especially for s sludge furthermore cp pretreatment also reduced the chromaticity of both biogas slurries therefore compared with p sludge s sludge is worth pretreating with cp which would significantly promote the degradation of some refractory organic matters pathogen removal and anaerobic digestion performance as well as improve the digestate property to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility further it is necessary to optimize the dosage and time of cp pretreatment and implement it in pilot scale or full

12842,in order to evaluate comprehensively the impact of calcium peroxide cp on anaerobic digestion ad of primary sludge p sludge and secondary sludge s sludge of anaerobic anoxic aerobic process a series of batch experiments were conducted in the lab scale results showed that cp pretreatment could kill fecal coliform completely in 72 0 h and promote the solubilization of s sludge more significantly than p sludge compared with the control the maximum ch4 production potential and the maximum specific ch4 production rate of p sludge ad only increased by 11 2 and 6 10 respectively but those of s sludge ad increased by 40 7 and 58 4 after the same pretreatment indicating that cp pretreatment was more conducive to methane production of s sludge moreover the increase of alkalinity and initial acetate concentration of s sludge was greater than that of p sludge after pretreatment according to the process analysis of hydrolysis notably cp pretreatment reduced the po4 3 p concentration and chromaticity in the ad supernatant of both sludges which was beneficial to the subsequent treatment of biogas slurry in addition cp pretreatment increased the content of total nutrient and decreased the content of harmful heavy metals in both biogas residues conclusively compared with p sludge cp pretreatment is more suitable for s sludge ad this work firstly provides a comprehensive evaluation of cp pretreatment to waste sludge produced in anaerobic anoxic aerobic process of wastewater treatment plant wwtp which is of great significance in enriching the pretreatment technology of waste sludge and promoting the application of cp pretreatment in wwtp graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion calcium peroxide pretreatment primary sludge secondary sludge digestate data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction with the increase in population and acceleration of industrialization and urbanization anthropological activities generate vast amounts of wastewater wastewater is rich in carbon nitrogen and phosphorus leading to severe eutrophication or even black and smelly problem in many receiving water ecosystems when discharged directly 1 the early secondary treatment of municipal wastewater only required removal of organic matter with the reduction in water environment reception capacity the discharge standard of the wastewater treatment plant has become increasingly strict it requires the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater obligatorily anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process is widely used in china and even worldwide because of its good effect of nitrogen and phosphorus removal 2 the sludge produced from a2 o process mainly consists of primary sludge p sludge and secondary sludge s sludge which have different properties the former has high content of easily degradable organic matter and pathogenic bacteria whereas the latter has high content of nitrogen and phosphorus but is difficult to degrade 3 these sludges not only have a huge output but are also abundant in pollutants and pathogens thereby causing various environmental problems with inappropriate treatment therefore how to treat sludge safely and minimize the adverse effects of sludge on human health and the environment have become an urgent problem 4 the optimal goals of sludge treatment are stabilization harmlessness reduction and resource utilization which can be achieved synchronously through anaerobic digestion ad however sludge hydrolysis is usually the limiting step of sludge anaerobic digestion to produce methane 5 6 many pretreatment methods have been studied to accelerate methane production including thermal pretreatment ultrasonic pretreatment anaerobic or aerobic pre digestion alkali pretreatment etc 7 8 among the sludge pretreatment technologies mentioned above thermal pretreatment can significantly promote sludge hydrolysis but requires high energy consumption and does not always yield positive results ultrasonic pretreatment is easy to operate but its high cost limits the application in china anaerobic or aerobic pre digestion is cheap but the optimal conditions for microbial activity are difficult to control alkali pretreatment requires additional dosing of chemicals and there is a risk of chemical pollution due to calcium peroxide cp has the advantages of strong oxidizing property good thermal stability and available alkaline condition it has been put forward to treat sludge in recent years 9 being a solid inorganic peroxide cp can not only generate free radicals i e oh and o2 that decompose sludge cell walls to release extracellular polymers and intracellular substances but also produce ca oh 2 to improve the sludge hydrolysis 10 11 due to this property cp was proposed as an additive for sludge pretreatment to enhance methanogenic performance wang et al 12 studied the effect of cp on the ad of s sludge and elucidated that cp pretreatment enhanced methane production by promoting the degradation of refractory substances in the s sludge in addition it has also been confirmed that cp pretreatment combined with other technologies can promote methanogenesis of s sludge zhang et al 13 found that the combination of cp pretreatment and zero valent iron can significantly promote the ad of s sludge and the methane production was increased by 9 70 and 13 8 compared with sole cp pretreatment or zero valent iron addition reactors respectively wang et al 14 combined cp with microwave to pretreat s sludge and found that the optimal pretreatment condition was cp 0 100 g g volatile suspended solids microwave 480 w 2 00 min for sludge methane production notably the previous studies mainly focused on s sludge by cp and the differential effects of cp pretreatment on p sludge and s sludge ad system are still unclear in addition from the perspective of environmental and health risks the effect of cp pretreatment on sludge pathogen removal is an important issue because the direct landfill of dewatered sludge normally occupies a certain share of sludge disposal in many regions and countries 15 16 however the effect of cp pretreatment on the pathogen removal efficiency of different sludges especially on the p sludge with high pathogen content has rarely been reported moreover the effect of cp on the properties of biogas residue and slurry usually affects the further disposal or utilization after sludge anaerobic digestion but is few nowadays this work studied the effect of cp pretreatment on the properties and fecal coliform numbers of p sludge and s sludge initially furthermore the differences in the hydrolysis and methane production of both sludges in anaerobic digestion after cp pretreatment were evaluated finally the effect of cp pretreatment on the properties of biogas residue and slurry after anaerobic digestion of both sludges was assessed this work evaluated the impact of cp pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of p sludge and s sludge comprehensively broadened the understanding of cp pretreatment on sludge treatment and disposal in wastewater treatment plants which would undoubtedly enrich the treatment and disposal technologies of waste sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludges and inoculum p sludge and s sludge used were respectively collected from the primary and secondary sedimentation tanks of xi an no 4 wastewater treatment plant which adopted a2 o process to treat municipal wastewater of five hundred thousand cubic meters per day the inoculated sludge was collected from a laboratory scale anaerobic reactor 35 0 1 0 c and domesticated for a period to avoid the influence of sludge solid content on pretreatment effect and enhance the test comparability between different sludges the method of gravity concentration or dilution with deionized water was used to adjust the solid content of p sludge and s sludge the main parameters of both sludges for pretreatment and inoculum for ad are presented in table s1 2 2 experimental design and setup 2 2 1 pretreatment of p sludge and s sludge with cp four serum bottles with a working volume of 250 ml were used for cp pretreatment of p sludge and s sludge initially 125 ml of p sludge and 125 ml of s sludge as shown in table s1 were placed into two serum bottles without cp addition and numbered as p ck and s ck respectively then some cp were added to the two other serum bottles into which 125 ml of p sludge and 125 ml of s sludge were placed in advance and numbered as p cp and s cp respectively the cp dosage in p cp and s cp was 0 140 g cao2 g vs which referred to the results of wang et al 12 the time and temperature of pretreatment in all reactors were set to 72 0 h and 25 0 c respectively 2 2 2 anaerobic digestion experiment of both sludges pretreated with cp anaerobic digestion experiment was carried out to evaluate the anaerobic digestion performance of p sludge and s sludge pretreated with cp which was carried out with a series of different working volume serum bottles including 100 ml for gas analysis and 250 ml for hydrolysis analysis for the hydrolysis analysis the sludge and inoculum were added to each reactor to obtain a mixture of 240 ml with a ratio of 1 i e vsinoculum vssludge after completing the pretreatment operation described in 2 2 1 the reactor used for gas production analysis was performed the same as the hydrolysis analysis to obtain a mixture of 60 0 ml sludge and inoculum with three parallel sets for each group blank experiments with inoculum only were performed to remove the biogas produced from the inoculation sludge the ph in all the reactors was adjusted to 7 00 0 10 by hcl naoh 2 00 mol l all the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 2 00 min to ensure anaerobic environment before being sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in a 35 0 1 0 c air bath shaker 140 rpm the reactors were sequentially numbered as p ck ad p cp ad s ck ad and s cp ad corresponding to their respective pretreatment conditions 2 3 sample and analytical methods in the test of cp pretreatment the dissolved chemical oxygen demand scod in different sludges was measured every 24 0 h and the changes in soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide were measured initially and at the end of test the biodegradability of organics released in the liquor phase was analyzed using excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy hitachi f 7000 japan meanwhile the number of fecal coliform before and after pretreatment was measured by determination method for municipal sludge in wastewater treatment plant wwtp cj t 221 2005 by china with its unit being colony forming units cfu g ts 17 tcod and scod were measured by potassium dichromate method 18 and soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide were measured via lowry folin and phenol sulfuric methods respectively 19 20 in ad experiment the biogas production was determined daily by using a calibrated glass syringe the biogas was collected every five days and its composition was analyzed by gc agilent6890n tcd and tdx 01 liquid samples 10 0 ml were collected from the serum bottle once every five days for determination the ph was determined using a lightning magnetic ph meter phs 3c then the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 0 min and 2 00 ml of the supernatant was obtained to determine the alkalinity by acid base titration an amount of 1 ml of the supernatant was passed through a cellulose acetate filter with pore size of 0 220 μm and 50 0 μl of formic acid was added to adjust the ph to 2 0 then gc agilent 6890 n fid was used to measure volatile fatty acids vfas the remaining supernatant was passed through a cellulose acetate filter with pore size of 0 450 μm for measurement of soluble parameters including scod total ammonia nitrogen tan and po4 3 p the concentrations of scod tan and po4 3 p were measured by potassium dichromate method nessler s reagent colorimetric and molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometric method respectively 18 at the end of ad experiment the samples obtained from the serum bottles were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 00 min and then filtered through 0 450 μm cellulose acetate membrane the supernatant was collected as biogas slurry and the concentrate was collected as biogas residue the ph chromaticity total nitrogen tn nh4 n total phosphorus tp po4 3 p chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 of biogas slurry were measured by the standard methods 18 olympus handheld xrf analyzer vanta shanghai zequan instruments was used to determine the metal content of biogas residues the determination methods of tp tn and total potassium tk in biogas residues were referred from han et al 21 in addition ts and vs were determined by gravimetric method 18 all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the data are displayed in the form of arithmetic mean standard deviation 2 4 processing parameters and analysis the lag phase time λ and the maximum methane production potential p 0 were calculated according to the modified gompertz model eq 1 as follows 22 1 p p 0 exp exp r max e p 0 λ t 1 where p ml g vs is the cumulative ch4 yield at time t e is exp 1 2 72 r max ml g vs day is the maximum specific ch4 production rate p 0 ml g vs is the maximum ch4 production potential and λ day is the lag phase time the parameters in this equation p 0 r max and λ are estimated using the nonlinear fitting of origin 2017 the free ammonia nitrogen fan concentration was calculated in accordance with the actual ph and temperature using eq 2 as follows 23 2 fan tan 1 10 ph 10 0 09018 2729 92 t k 1 where tan mg l is the total ammonia concentration fan mg l is the free ammonia nitrogen concentration t k is the kelvin temperature the sludge disintegration rate sdcod was calculated according to eq 3 as follows 3 sd cod c scod after c scod 0 c tcod 0 c scod 0 100 where c scodafter mg l is the final scod concentration after the sludge was pretreated c scod0 mg l is the initial scod concentration before the sludge was pretreated c tcod0 mg l is the initial tcod concentration in the sludge before pretreatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cp pretreatment on organic matter and fecal coliform of sludge 3 1 1 effects of pretreatment on organic matter of sludge 1 effect of pretreatment on scod soluble proteins and polysaccharides of sludge fig s1 illustrates the effects of cp pretreatment on the concentration of scod soluble proteins and polysaccharides in p sludge and s sludge as shown in fig s1 a the time course of scod concentration in both sludges was very similar it increased sharply after 24 0 h and then maintained a slight increase trend until 72 0 h scod concentration increased from 123 10 mg l to 3192 61 mg l in p sludge after pretreatment for 72 0 h whereas it increased from 351 25 mg l to 3315 79 mg l in s sludge resulting in sdcod of p sludge and s sludge of 11 6 and 11 8 respectively fig s1 b shows that the concentrations of soluble protein and polysaccharide in p ck were almost unchanged and that s ck slightly increased after 72 0 h however 72 0 h of cp pretreatment caused the concentrations of soluble protein and polysaccharide in p cp to increase by 7 00 and 15 2 times respectively whereas those in s cp increased by 8 83 and 15 3 times respectively therefore cp pretreatment acutely promoted sludge dissolution the results showed that cp pretreatment significantly enhanced the concentration of scod soluble proteins and polysaccharides in both sludges this finding may be due to the fact that cp can react with water to generate ca oh 2 and free radicals h2o2 oh and o2 wang et al 24 proposed that h2o2 is a strong chemical oxidant that can damage the cell wall of microorganisms leading to the release of cytoplasm similarly erden et al 25 pointed out that oh and o2 can attack the cell wall of microorganisms and oxidize it into dissolved organic matter moreover ca oh 2 can cause lipid saponification in the cell wall leading to the dissolution of solid organic matter 26 although high concentrations of ca2 introduced by pretreatment was not beneficial to sludge dissolution h2o2 oh o2 and alkali were documented to enhance sludge disintegration largely meanwhile it can be observed that the impact of cp pretreatment on s sludge was slightly larger than that on p sludge which may be due to the differences of the properties between p sludge and s sludge for s sludge microbial cell i e including extracellular polymers and intracellular substances is the main component and source of scod which is difficult to dissolve inherently 27 however the source of scod in p sludge is particulate organic matter that is easy to decompose inherently although cp had a certain influence on p sludge the degree of influence was smaller than that on s sludge in general cp pretreatment provided more soluble organic matter for the subsequent digestion stages of p sludge and s sludge but had a greater impact on s sludge 2 changes in soluble organic matter in sludge pretreated with cp to examine whether cp pretreatment caused degradations of the recalcitrant organic 3d fluorescence analysis was used to analyze the effect of cp pretreatment on the content and types of soluble organic substances in sludge eem spectrum and fluorescence of organic matter released from different reactors after 72 0 h of cp pretreatment are shown in fig 1 as shown in figs 1 a b tryptophan like substances tp soluble microbial by product like substances smp and humic acid like substances ha appeared in p sludge and s sludge without cp from figs 1 c d it can be seen that no new fluorescence peaks were generated in both sludges after cp pretreatment and the original fluorescence peaks of tp and ha were quenched only leaving the changed fluorescence intensity of smp the fluorescence intensity of smp in p cp increased by 32 7 times after cp pretreatment compared with that in p ck while it was increased by 40 0 times in s cp compared with that in s ck zhang et al 13 showed that oh and o2 produced by cp during pretreatment were beneficial to the degradation of refractory substances in the s sludge thereby increasing the content of easily degradable substances these results showed that cp pretreatment was more conducive to the dissolution of easily degradable substances in the s sludge compared with p sludge 3 1 2 effects of cp pretreatment on the number of fecal coliform in p sludge and s sludge being one of the most familiar hygienic indicators the number of fecal coliform was used in this study to describe the effects of cp pretreatment on both sludges as shown in table 1 it can be seen that the number of fecal coliform in p sludge was larger than that in s sludge initially after 72 0 h the number of fecal coliform in unpretreated p sludge and s sludge was 5 28 0 15 105 cfu g ts and 2 34 0 09 105 cfu g ts which decreased by 89 9 and 86 4 respectively however the cp pretreatment resulted in a 100 inactivation rate of fecal coliform in each sludge where the number of fecal coliform reached the requirement of sludge quality from municipal wwtp gb 24188 2009 and standard for sludge stabilization treatment of municipal wwtp cj t 510 2017 by china 28 29 this result was superior to other pretreatment technologies reported in previous studies liu et al 30 found only free ammonia treatment 560 mg nh3 n l combined with ad could meet the requirement for class a biosolids usepa 1994 and wang et al 31 showed that ultrasonic pretreatment could not inactivate fecal coliform at the frequency and power density of 20 0 khz and 2 50 w ml respectively although ad can remove a certain number of pathogens 32 cp pretreatment can effectively inactivate pathogenic bacteria of sludge which undoubtedly provide a simple effective and safe pretreatment method when the sludge is landfilled directly without ad 3 2 effects of cp pretreatment on ad of p sludge and s sludge 3 2 1 biogas production 1 daily and cumulative biogas production fig 2 demonstrates the effects of cp pretreatment on the daily biogas production and cumulative biogas production of both sludges during ad as shown in fig 2 a the daily biogas production of p sludge was evidently higher than that of s sludge during the whole ad process which may attribute to that most organic matter in the p sludge is easily degradable and can be degraded by hydrolyzing bacteria 33 whereas the microbial cell walls in the s sludge are mostly refractory organic substances 34 the results in section 3 1 showed that pretreatment provided more soluble organic matter for microorganisms especially s sludge therefore it can be found that the average daily biogas production of s cp ad in the first 7 days reached 16 16 0 46 ml g vs d which was higher than 10 30 0 68 ml g vs d of s ck ad meanwhile the pretreatment increased the average daily biogas production from 18 39 0 63 ml g vs d in p ck ad to 21 29 0 53 ml g vs d in p cp ad on days 7 to 11 all these results demonstrated that cp pretreatment mainly affected the biogas production in the early stage of sludge especially for s sludge in the later stage of ad the daily biogas productions of all groups showed declining trend due to the decrease in available organic matter but the daily biogas productions of the pretreatment groups were still slightly higher than that of the control groups only on the 21st and 23rd days the daily biogas production of s cp ad was lower than that of s ck ad from fig 2 b it is observed that the curve of cumulative biogas production with cp pretreatment was evidently higher than that without cp pretreatment by the end of ad the cumulative biogas production of p cp ad and s cp ad reached 432 10 and 185 9 ml g vs respectively which were increased by 6 77 and 35 1 compared with the corresponding control group noticeably cp had a better effect on improving the biogas production performance of s sludge which was consistent with the previous pretreatment results therefore cp increased significantly the cumulative biogas production of s sludge but had a limited effect on p sludge 2 average content of biogas components the biogas component contents of ad process in different reactors are presented in table 2 it can be observed that cp pretreatment could increase ch4 content in the biogas thereby enhancing ch4 content in the biogas from 68 6 in p ck ad and 55 5 in s ck ad to 70 0 in p cp ad and 59 4 in s cp ad however cp pretreatment reduced co2 content in the biogas the co2 content of p ck ad s ck ad p cp ad and s cp ad was 23 9 23 7 22 3 and 19 3 respectively fu et al 35 showed that ca oh 2 generated by cp can partially fix co2 in biogas in situ through the reaction of ca oh 2 co2 caco3 h2o which reduced the amount of biogas but increased its ch4 content because biogas is mainly composed of ch4 and co2 noticeably although cp increased 3 85 ch4 content in the biogas of s sludge on the average it was still lower than that in the biogas of the p sludge group which may result from the relatively high carbon nitrogen ratio in the p sludge 36 in addition the average n2 content in s ck ad was 20 74 which was higher than that in p ck ad 7 57 the difference may lie in the presence of nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the s sludge which could produce more n2 in the early stage of ad due to oxygen supply from cp resulting in higher average n2 in the biogas 37 table 2 also showed that the average n2 content of s ck ad was only 1 4 higher than that of s cp ad indicating that the bacteria related to nitrogen conversion may be able to survive partially under cp pretreatment although cp could release oh o2 and alkali in general cp pretreatment could increase ch4 contents in the biogas of both sludges and the promotion effect on s sludge was more significant 3 fitting results using the modified gompertz equation the relevant parameters fitted by the modified gompertz equation are summarized in table 3 it is obvious that r2 of each group was greater than 0 990 indicating that the model fitted the data very well the inoculum used in this experiment was obtained under the condition of mesophilic ad thus the λ of each group was less than 0 100 it also indicated that cp pretreatment slightly affected the λ of both sludges in addition the p 0 and r max of p cp ad clearly increased by 11 2 and 6 10 respectively when compared with those of p ck ad whereas the p 0 and r max of the s cp ad group increased by 40 7 and 58 4 respectively when compared with those of s ck ad reflecting that cp pretreatment had greater influence on s sludge than p sludge in the p 0 and r max of ad these results showed that cp pretreatment can not only improve the methanogenesis potential of sludge to supplement the energy consumption of sewage treatment plants but significantly increase its methanogenesis rate to reduce the sludge residence time thereby reducing the capital cost especially s sludge 3 2 2 hydrolysis processes 1 time course of scod and po4 3 p concentration fig 3 indicates the evolution of scod and po4 3 p concentration in the liquid phase during ad process as shown in fig 3 a the scod concentrations of the control groups p ck ad and s ck ad reached the maximum value on the fifth day of ad indicating that the first 5 days of ad was the hydrolysis and acidification stage for the control groups from then on the dissolution rate of scod slowed down and the gas generation stage continued thus the consumption rate of scod was greater than the dissolution rate resulting in a gradual decrease in the concentration of scod on the 15th day of ad the cumulative methane production of p ck ad and s ck ad reached 331 5 ml g vs and 110 7 ml g vs respectively after day 15 the scod concentration showed an increasing trend as the gas production rate decreased different from the control groups the scod concentrations of the pretreatment groups p cp ad and s cp ad reached the maximum initially and showed a downward trend in the early stage of ad indicating that more soluble organic matter was accumulated in the pretreated sludges due to cp introduction initially and then was immediately utilized to produce biogas at the beginning as shown in fig 2 a this finding reflected that cp pretreatment mainly promoted incipient ad methanogenesis however the scod concentrations of s cp ad and p cp ad increased to another high value on the 20th day of ad li et al 38 pointed out that in addition to being consumed by microbial metabolism during gasification scod may also be oxidized by h2o2 released from cp h2o2 could not play a role in the second high value of scod in this experiment because the biogas production curves were very similar for the sludges with and without cp pretreatment demonstrating that the methanogenesis was unaffected by the strong chemical oxidant the only possibility was that cp pretreatment partly destroyed the insoluble organic matters which underwent a period of 20 days to converse into scod therefore the late accumulation of scod in s sludge seemed to result from indirect cp pretreatment previous studies reported that cp promoted the release of scod during sludge ad but the effect of adding cp on po4 3 p release was rarely discussed fig 3 b shows the time course of po4 3 p concentration in the supernatant of different sludges it shows that the average po4 3 p concentration was 27 4 5 83 55 0 and 12 8 mg l in the supernatant of p ck ad p cp ad s ck ad and s cp ad respectively evidently adding cp inhibited the release of po4 3 p comparing with control group huang et al 39 found that cp would produce ca oh 2 which could react with po4 3 p to ca10 po4 6 oh 2 and other precipitates transferring the orthophosphate in the liquid phase to the solid phase however ahn et al 40 showed that the presence of alkali accelerated the release of phosphate during sludge ad process therefore the reduced concentration of po4 3 p in the pretreated sludges indicated that the precipitation rate of po4 3 p was greater than the release rate of po4 3 p in this study it also found that with or without cp the po4 3 p concentration in p sludge was obviously lower than that in s sludge which was ascribed to the cell body of microorganism dominated in s sludge hydrolysis caused the lysis of microorganism cell which led to the release of phosphorus from the cell to the liquid phase 19 in addition a large amount of polyphosphate would be released when the cell body was ruptured because the s sludge was obtained from an a2 o system and contained a higher proportion of polyphosphorus bacteria in general cp pretreatment could evidently reduce the phosphate concentration in the supernatant of p sludge and s sludge which was beneficial to subsequent treatment of digestive slurry 2 time course of vfas concentration fig 4 shows the evolution of vfas concentration in the liquid phase during ad organic acids are available substrates for the biogas production stage of methanogens when the organic acids are consumed faster the biogas is also produced more rapidly as shown in fig 4 a the total vfas tvfas concentration of p sludge and s sludge on day 0 of ad were 126 mg l and 87 1 mg l respectively which was lower than previous studies 41 this could be ascribed to the sludge used in this study was low vs ts which had a long sludge age and was sampled in the rainy season the concentration of tvfas in p ck ad reached a maximum of 206 12 mg l on the fifth day and then decreased to 27 6 2 8 mg l on day 10 on the contrary the concentration of tvfas in s ck ad decreased from 87 1 5 4 mg l on day 0 to 0 000 0 000 mg l on the 10th day this finding was consistent with the change in daily biogas production fig 2 a comparatively p sludge produced more vfas than s sludge mainly because p sludge contained a great deal of biodegradable organic matters whereas the microbial cells with inert cell membranes and walls were mainly composed of s sludge leading to the slow hydrolysis and acidification of s sludge 42 43 however the concentrations of tvfas in p cp ad and s cp ad showed a downward trend in the early stage of ad and the sludge after pretreatment had a high initial soluble organic concentration the organic matter in the sludge was rapidly utilized by microorganisms at the beginning of anaerobic reaction indicating that pretreatment mainly promoted methane production in the early stage of ad in addition the concentrations of vfas in all groups were dominated by acetate and propionate but the acetate concentrations were affected significantly by cp pretreatment the concentration of acetate in p ck ad and s ck ad on the 0th day was 120 4 and 52 3 2 7 mg l respectively the value increased to 298 6 and 255 3 mg l in p cp ad and s cp ad respectively representing an increase by 1 48 and 3 87 times acetate is well known as the main digestion substrate of methanogens in this study acetate could be provided by cp pretreatment and further be converted to produce more methane this result was partly attributed to cp providing a certain amount of o2 in the early stage of ad lim et al 44 showed that limited aeration can convert other vfas into acetic acid the alkali produced by the reaction of cp with water might also play an important role in the change in the concentration of vfas su et al 45 treated s sludge with ca oh 2 and obtained high concentration of acetic acid but the concentration of other vfas decreased ping et al 46 found that the addition of cp increased the acetate yield during the fermentation process and the acetic acid concentration increased significantly with the extension of the fermentation time therefore the differences in sludge properties decreased the concentrations of vfa components in s sludge compared with that in p sludge and the presence of cp was beneficial to acetate productions in different sludges especially for s sludge 3 time course of ph alkalinity and the concentration of tan and fan fig 5 shows the time course of ph alkalinity and the concentration of tan and fan in each reactor from figs 5 a and 5 b it can be observed that the ph values and alkalinity concentrations in all groups gradually increased with time but the ph values and alkalinity concentrations in the pretreatment groups were higher than those in the control groups due to the reaction between ca oh 2 generated by cp and co2 to form caco3 meanwhile cp pretreatment promoted the generation of alkaline substances such as ammonia nitrogen even if more organic acids were generated the system still showed higher alkalinity and ph 47 shen et al 48 pointed out that the optimal alkalinity for stable operation of ad was 2000 3000 mgcaco3 l in this study the addition of cp was beneficial to improve the buffer capacity of the system and maintain the alkalinity in an appropriate range notably the alkalinity of s cp ad maintained the highest concentration during the whole ad process which may be the reason why cp pretreatment promotes higher efficiency of methane production of s sludge than p sludge unfortunately the ph of s cp ad increased to 7 96 0 06 on the 20th day which may affect the consumption of organic matter by the methanogenesis process 49 this phenomenon was consistent with the previous results that is the concentrations of scod and vfas in s cp ad restarted to accumulate on the 20th day as shown in fig 5 c tan concentrations in the pretreated sludges were higher than those in the unpretreated sludges due to the advanced oxidation of cp and the action of ca oh 2 resulting in the further hydrolysis of proteins and the release of more ammonia nitrogen noticeably the curve of tan concentrations in pretreated s sludge was the highest because s sludge is mainly composed of activated sludge flocs with microorganisms as the skeleton and contains more insoluble proteins that can release a large amount of ammonia nitrogen during the hydrolysis process therefore at the end of the experiment the tan concentration in s cp ad was 840 22 mg l which was higher than that in s ck ad 648 25 mg l as well as p cp ad 682 23 mg l since the concentration of fan is related to tan ph and temperature fig 5 d shows that the change trend of fan concentration was similar to that of tan and ph in this experiment however the fan concentration of s cp ad increased rapidly on the 20th day similar to ph in fig 5 a and scod in fig 3 a yenigün and demirel 50 found that fan concentration exceeding 600 mg l would lead to unstable methane production whereas the highest concentration of fan in s cp ad was only 66 9 2 3 mg l in this study indicating that cp pretreatment would not cause the instability in ad systems of both sludges in conclusion cp pretreatment enhanced the ph values and alkalinity concentrations as well as the concentrations of tan and fan for p sludge and s sludge but those in s sludge pretreated by cp were the highest 3 3 effects of cp pretreatment on the properties of biogas residue and slurry 3 3 1 properties of biogas residue in different sludge ad the effects of cp pretreatment on the properties of biogas residue after ad of p sludge and s sludge are shown in table s2 it is found that the total nutrient content i e tn tp and tk of p ck ad p cp ad s ck ad and s cp ad biogas residues was 5 45 0 19 5 52 0 25 6 52 0 28 and 6 78 0 34 respectively this result indicated that the total nutrient contents in all biogas residues could satisfy exceed 5 00 of the total nutrient content as required for ny525 2012 standard of the ministry of agriculture of the people s republic of china 51 notably the total nutrient content in the residue of s sludge was higher than that of p sludge which was determined by the differences in their properties and similar to the finding of peng et al 52 moreover cp pretreatment increased the total nutrient contents of the two sludge biogas residues evidently this was due to the precipitation reaction between ca2 and phosphate in the supernatant of cp pretreatment group which increased the tp content in the residue table s2 also shows that in addition to as the contents of heavy metals in all biogas residues could satisfy b level in the chinese national standard for the control of pollutants in agricultural sludge gb 4284 2018 53 although the content of calcium ca in biogas residue of p cp ad and s cp ad were 70 9 and 104 higher than that of p ck ad and s ck ad respectively the contents of other harmful heavy metals ni pb cu as and zn except for cr in biogas residues of p cp ad and s cp ad were slightly lower than those of p ck ad and s ck ad this finding may be attributed to cao2 induced peroxidation that could destroy the combination of extracellular polymers and metal ions in sludge thereby promoting the release of heavy metals from sludge to the water phase 54 naserian et al reported that the end product of digestion might be not fully stabilized and required further treatment 55 however cp pretreatment in this study not only increased the total nutrient contents but decreased the heavy metal contents in the two sludge biogas residues which was of great significance for the utilization of residues in farmland 3 3 2 properties of biogas slurry in different sludge ad the effects of cp pretreatment on the properties of digested slurry in different sludge ad are shown in table s3 it is clearly observed that the cp pretreatment reduced evidently the chroma tp and po4 3 p concentrations in the two sludge biogas slurries chroma tp and po4 3 p concentrations in the biogas slurry of p sludge were reduced by 54 5 77 7 and 88 9 respectively compared with p ck ad whereas those in the biogas slurry of s sludge decreased by 40 0 60 5 and 79 1 compared with s ck ad meanwhile cp pretreatment increased the nitrogen and cod concentrations of the slurries in both sludges however cp pretreatment increased bod5 concentration in the slurry of p sludge but decreased that of s sludge in summary cp could improve the chroma and reduce the phosphorus concentration in the biogas slurry of p sludge and s sludge but it could increase the concentrations of ammonia and cod in the two sludge biogas slurries 3 4 implications this study firstly evaluated the difference in the effect of cp pretreatment on the ad of p sludge and s sludge in terms of sludge properties methane production and digestate for disposal this work demonstrated that cp pretreatment was more favorable for s sludge than s sludge compared with the control cp pretreatment with 0 140 g g vs increased the methane production of s sludge by 40 7 which was higher than that of fenton pretreatment 15 0 56 alkaline pretreatment 29 6 57 and ultrasonic pretreatment 31 0 58 apart from methane production cp pretreatment also effectively enhanced stubborn organic matter degradation pathogen removal and final disposal of s sludge li et al 59 first proposed the concept of nutrient removal energy recovery for the operation of a wwtp using cp as sludge pretreatment compared with the pretreatment method of thermal hydrolysis that is currently widely used in china cp pretreatment can improve the rate of sludge crushed under normal temperature conditions with lower energy consumption but obtain methane production equivalent to thermal hydrolysis 60 it should be also noted that the above discussion is only based on the laboratory scale study and pilot scale or full scale research is needed urgently in the future 4 conclusions in this study the effects of cp pretreatment on the dissolution of p sludge and s sludge the number of fecal coliform the mesophilic ad performance and the properties of digested residue and slurry were evaluated synthetically the results showed that cp pretreatment could promote the degradation of some refractory organic matters in both sludges especially for s sludge meanwhile cp pretreatment could kill fecal coliform in 72 0 h in ad process compared with p sludge cp pretreatment increased the methane production of s sludge more significantly which could increase p 0 and r max of s sludge ad increased by 40 7 and 58 4 than the control respectively this finding may be due to that cp pretreatment increased the alkalinity and initial acetic acid concentration of s sludge by higher multiple than p sludge notably cp pretreatment reduced on the average by 78 7 and 76 7 of po4 3 p concentration in the supernatant of p sludge and s sludge compared with the control group respectively resulting in an increased p content in the digested residue and a decreased p concentration in the digested slurry finally cp pretreatment further increased the content of total nutrient and ca in both biogas residues but reduced the content of harmful heavy metals especially for s sludge furthermore cp pretreatment also reduced the chromaticity of both biogas slurries therefore compared with p sludge s sludge is worth pretreating with cp which would significantly promote the degradation of some refractory organic matters pathogen removal and anaerobic digestion performance as well as improve the digestate property to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility further it is necessary to optimize the dosage and time of cp pretreatment and implement it in pilot scale or full

12843,a series of interpenetrating polymer network sodium alginate g poly sodium acrylate pasa hydrogels pasa 1 pasa 3 and pasa 5 were prepared through the thermal radical polymerization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results revealed that all the hydrogels had been prepared successfully the effects of various amounts of sodium alginate sa on various properties were investigated when increasing the amount of sa in pasa polymer the number of pores increased but the size of poores decreased in addition pasa hydrogels presenting crosslinking qualities exhibited relatively low swelling in water finally the synthesized hydrogels were tested as adsorbents for ammonium chloride nh4cl solution the pasa 1 hydrogel exhibited the highest ammonia nitrogen adsorption capacity 12 9 mg g which 21 1 higher than that of the reference poly sodium acrylate pana hydrogel 10 7 mg g under similar conditions the synthesized pasa 1 hydrogel exhibited satisfactory reusability and maintained 87 of its adsorption capacity after nine cycles of ammonium nitrogen adsorption desorption graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption desorption ammonium nitrogen aqueous solution hydrogel sodium alginate g poly sodium acrylate 1 introduction water eutrophication has become a major environmental problem worldwide and causes the destruction of aquatic ecosystems 1 4 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n is a wastewater pollutant that often causes water eutrophication 5 water eutrophication can have various environmental impacts such as the excessive growth of algae fish death and poor drinking water quality 4 6 furthermore ammonium nh4 derivatives such as nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 pose serious risks to human health 7 accordingly the removal of nh4 n from eutrophic waters around the world is essential to develop sufficient reusable and low cost materials for nh4 n removal 1 biological treatments such as biological methods 8 9 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation 10 2 chemical treatments such as breakpoint chlorination 11 and chemical precipitation 12 and 3 physical treatments such as ion exchange 13 air stripping 14 microwave radiation 15 and the use of inorganic nanoparticles 16 or organic inorganic adsorbents 17 21 have been developed of these methods the use of organic inorganic adsorbents such as polymer based or polymer inorganic composites has increased considerably in the removal of contaminants from wastewater because of their low cost high efficiency chemical stability ease of handling and reusability 22 26 in addition adsorption application of the nanocomposite hydrogels were deeply reviewed by sharma et al 27 one polymer based material namely poly acrylic acid paa is currently considered a favorable material for nh4 n removal because of its commercial availability low cost and high adsorption efficiency 28 29 cruz et al achieved the rapid removal of nh4 n from domestic wastewater by using paa only hydrogels 28 in our previous study we prepared neutral sodium acrylate ana from acrylic acid and synthesized the related compound poly ana pana under different crosslinker n n methylene bisacrylamide mba and initiator ammonium persulfate aps concentrations 29 pikaar et al investigated the difference between the adsorption capability and swelling behavior of paa and pana hydrogels 30 a balanced crosslinking density and swelling behavior were the key factors required for achieving optimal adsorption desorption properties for further improving the adsorption capabilities mechanical properties and chemical stability of paa hydrogels inorganic components have been added into them to develop modified paa copolymers 31 33 for example wang et al developed several paa composites such as chitosan g paa rectorite 34 chitosan g paa attapulgite 35 paa biotite 36 polyvinyl alcohol paa tourmaline 37 and chitosan g paa unexpanded vermiculite 38 for nh4 n removal the maximum adsorption of these composites was in the range of 21 0 40 6 mg g guan et al synthesized paa g chitosan and biochar composites with a maximum adsorption capacity of 149 25 mg g 39 the results obtained for the paa composite hydrogels mentioned above are also presented in table s1 all the composites exhibited a higher adsorption capacity and adsorption rate for ammonia nitrogen than did paa thus the preparation of paa composites for ammonia nitrogen removal has considerable potential in industry however all the inorganic compounds used in the aforementioned studies have the disadvantage of being difficult to handle therefore they are likely to cause additional pollution new paa composites that are environmentally friendly must be developed for ammonia nitrogen removal sodium alginate sa is a linear biopolymer extracted from seaweed that possesses a ph sensitive nontoxic character and has been widely been used in the medical and food industries 40 therefore this compound is easier to handle than are the aforementioned paa composites furthermore because of the presence of large quantities of carboxylate and hydroxyl groups in sa it has been selected as a favorable superabsorbent for removing dyes from wastewater 31 41 43 to the best of our knowledge sa has not been converted into a composite hydrogel or used in an ammonia nitrogen adsorption system in this study we designed and synthesized a series of sa g poly ana pasa hydrogels containing various quantities of sa pasa hydrogels and reference poly ana pana hydrogels were prepared and used as absorbents to remove nh4 n from aqueous solutions the thermal properties water absorbency nh4 n adsorption capability and reusability of all the prepared hydrogels were assessed in addition adsorption isotherm models were employed to understand the adsorption behavior of ammonium nitrogen on the hydrogel adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials acrylic acid aa 95 alfa aesar aps 98 showa and sa very low viscosity alfa aesar were used without further purification ammonium chloride nh4cl 95 0 showa was purchased and a 100 ppm nh4 n solution was prepared nh4 n was analyzed photometrically by using a 1 00683 0001 spectroquant ammonium test from merck kgaa germany deionized water was purified with a milli q system millipore water 18 2 mω cm 2 2 synthesis of pana sa composite hydrogels overall formulations of the prepared pasa composites are summarized in table 1 a similar quantity of monomer aa and thermal initiator aps as well as various quantities of sa were used to form a series of hydrogels pasa 1 pasa 3 and pasa 5 which contained 1 3 and 5 wt sa respectively in addition reference pana was prepared according to the literature 29 for comparison for preparing pasa 1 aa 5 026 g monomer was first neutralized with sodium hydroxide 1 m to obtain ana with a ph value of approximately 5 in another flask sa 0 532 g was dissolved in deionized water 15 ml at 70 c subsequently the cooled clear sa solution was poured into the ana solution the overall solid content of the resultant solution was 30 wt finally 0 797 g of aps was added to the solution and the mixture was reacted at 70 c for 3 h after polymerization the hydrogel was washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried in a vacuum freeze dryer to a constant weight to obtain the target pasa 1 polymer the weight ratio of aa to sa was 10 1 pana pasa 3 and pasa 5 aa to sa weight ratios of 10 0 10 3 and 10 5 respectively were synthesized using a similar procedure as that described in the aforementioned text a schematic of the preparation of the pasa composites is presented in fig 1 2 3 water absorbency completely dry hydrogel 0 05 g was immersed in excess deionized water 20 ml at room temperature for 72 h to achieve swelling equilibrium the swollen polymer was then separated from the water until it no longer dripped the water absorption value of the hydrogel s eq was calculated using the following equation 44 1 s eq w s w d w d where w d and w s are the weights of the dry and swollen samples respectively the water absorption value s eq was calculated in grams of water per gram of sample 2 4 ammonium nitrogen adsorption measurement ammonium nitrogen adsorption equilibrium experiments were conducted as described in the following text dry hydrogel 0 05 g was first placed into a filter bag and immersed in deionized water for 72 h to achieve swelling equilibrium the filtrate hydrogel was then immersed in standard ammonia nitrogen solution for 1 h for preadsorption at this time the excessive free water in the hydrogel was released subsequently the hydrogel was immersed in 10 ml of sodium hydroxide 1 m solution for 10 min for regeneration with a constant ph value of 7 0 the hydrogel was washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove any residual sodium hydroxide finally the flash swollen hydrogel was immersed in ammonia nitrogen solution 10 ml 100 ppm for 1 h to obtain the adsorption results immersion lasted for 1 h to ensure that adsorption equilibrium was reached 29 the ammonium nitrogen adsorption value of the hydrogel q e was calculated using the following equation 44 2 q e c o c e w v where c o and c e are the initial and adsorption equilibrium concentrations mg l respectively v is the volume of the ammonia nitrogen solution and w is the weight of the initial dry hydrogel the ammonium nitrogen adsorption value q e was calculated in milligrams of ammonium nitrogen per gram of sample 2 5 ammonium nitrogen removal rate the ammonium nitrogen removal rate was calculated as follows 40 3 removal rate c o c e c o 100 2 6 reusability a reusability test was performed to observe the decrease in the adsorption capacity of the hydrogels after several adsorption desorption cycles none of the hydrogels were dissolved in the testing process to prepare for the reusability experiment each adsorbed hydrogel was immersed in 10 ml of sodium hydroxide 1 m solution for 10 min to complete regeneration each hydrogel was then washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove the residual sodium hydroxide on the surface before performing the reusability experiment the readsorption value of the hydrogel was also calculated using eq 2 2 7 measurements fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the samples were obtained by using an ftir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum one a perkin elmer dsc 6000a was used to determine the glass transition temperature t g under a nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 10 c min a differential thermal analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga instrument ta instruments sdt q600 was used to determine the temperature at which the prepared composites exhibited 5 wt weight loss t d under a nitrogen atmosphere when heated from 100 to 800 c at a heating rate of 15 c min the surface morphology of the composites was observed through analytical field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem zeiss auriga the crystallization properties of the composites were determined through x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 the ph value of the composites was measured using a ph meter ph cond tds sal meter 86 505 az the adsorption concentration of ammonium nitrogen was measured using a dynamica halo rb 10 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer at 25 c in combination with measurements a 1 00683 0001 spectroquant ammonium test from merck subsequently the absorption intensity at approximately 690 nm was obtained and the related adsorption quantity was calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of pana and pasa hydrogels in this study a series of pasa hydrogels were prepared in aqueous solution through the thermal radical polymerization of ana with various quantities of sa and aps fig 1 the compositions of these hydrogels are listed in table 1 aps was first decomposed under heat to generate sulfate anion radicals polymerization was caused by the reaction between sulfate anion radicals and ana monomers moreover reactive alkoxy radicals 45 were produced from sa these radicals reacted with ana or poly ana radicals to generate the sa g pana polymers 46 therefore the interpenetrating polymer network had a pana and sa g pana polymer chain in its structure the sa free hydrogel namely pana was prepared using a similar procedure to that described in the aforementioned text all the samples were insoluble in water which suggested that they were network polymerized in addition all the hydrogels were freeze dried to obtain the target absorbents the freeze drying method resulted in higher porosity than did the traditional heat drying method thus a high adsorption capability was expected to be achieved for the hydrogels prepared using the freeze drying method 42 we then used ftir spectroscopy to confirm the chemical structures of the hydrogels fig 2 illustrates the ftir spectra of the sa pana and pasa compounds the ftir spectra of sa exhibit a broad band at approximately 3500 3000 cm 1 because of the oh bond the bands at 1610 and 1414 cm 1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching peaks of carboxylate salt groups respectively the bands at 1303 cm 1 co stretching 1096 cm 1 co stretching 1031 cm 1 c o c stretching and 949 cm 1 co stretching are attributed to sa s saccharide structure 47 in the spectrum of the pana polymer the band at 1720 cm 1 corresponds to the co bond of the residual carboxylic acid group 48 the symmetrical stretching vibration of carboxylate salt groups appears at 1561 cm 1 furthermore no obvious sharp absorption peaks are located at 1640 cm 1 cc stretching or 1000 and 920 cm 1 c h bending which suggests that the double bond addition reaction was successfully performed for the pasa composites the stretching vibrations of the c oh groups of sa weakened after polymerization which indicated that the oh group of sa was involved in a chain reaction with ana or pana fig 1 46 in addition peaks appeared at approximately 1560 cm 1 carboxylate salt groups from pana and 1415 cm 1 carboxylate salt groups from sa in pasa s spectra 49 moreover the relative intensity at approximately 1415 cm 1 increased when the weight ratios of sa increased 3 2 thermal properties tga and differential scanning calorimetry dsc were conducted to determine the thermal properties of the composites fig 3a illustrates the tga curves and table 2 lists the related data the temperatures at which the samples exhibited 5 wt weight loss t d were determined under a nitrogen atmosphere the t d values ranged from 174 to 213 c and decreased in the following order sa 213 c pana 200 c pasa 1 198 c pasa 5 188 c pasa 3 174 c the sa sodium alginate showed poor thermal stability and decomposed rapidly at around 230 c because of the dehydration decarboxylation and decarbonylation in its structures 50 52 in addition the pasa 1 composite exhibited a higher t d value than did the pasa 3 composite because the pasa 3 composite had a higher sa content this result suggests that sa inhibited the chain growth of pana however pasa 5 which had the highest sa content exhibited a higher t d value than did pasa 3 this result was obtained because the thermal stability of sa which has a high crosslinking density had a stronger influence on t d than did the growth of the pana chain length in summary the chain length and crosslinking density were responsible for the differences in the thermal decomposition temperatures of the composites during the dsc experiments rapid cooling from high temperature to room temperature produced predominantly amorphous samples which allowed the t g values of all the composites to be observed in the second heating traces fig 3b the t g values of the pasa hydrogels were 64 89 c in addition the sa and pana compounds had tg values of 266 c 53 and 117 c respectively the growth of the pana chain was inhibited as sa was added therefore a gradual decrease in t g was observed from pasa 1 to pasa 3 when the content of sa was continually increased up to 5 wt pasa 5 the t g value increased possibly because of the high crosslinking density between pana and sa 46 3 3 surface morphology xrd and water swelling behavior of the composites the surface morphologies of the pana pasa 1 pasa 3 and pasa 5 samples are displayed in the fe sem images in fig 4 the surface of pana fig 4a became rough because of vacuum freeze drying however this surface was still smoother and tighter than those of the other composites the grafting of sa onto pana resulted in the creation of many pores on the surface fig 4b d in addition the pore size decreased with an increase in the sa content and high coverage was observed on the surfaces of pasa 3 and pasa 5 pasa 5 fig 4d exhibited a dense surface because its void spaces were filled by sa chains therefore limited water molecules entered the voids of pasa 5 xrd patterns of the selected dry freeze dried samples pana and pasa 1 are displayed in fig 5 the xrd patterns of pana exhibit wide peaks at 2θ values of approximately 18 6 and 39 2 and the xrd patterns of pasa 1 exhibit wide peaks at 2θ values of approximately 23 5 and 34 9 these results suggests that some crystallinity existed in the aforementioned hydrogels because of the freeze drying synthesis method notably all the 2θ peaks were broad which indicated that parts of the structures were amorphous however the addition of sa increased the intensity of the peaks which suggested that the addition of sa increased the perfection of hydrogel crystallization the effects of the sa content on the swelling properties of the pasa and pana hydrogels were studied none of the hydrogels were soluble in water because they had been polymerized the swelling properties of the aforementioned hydrogels are presented in fig 6 and table 2 in addition fig s1 depicts the preswelling and postswelling images of the pasa 1 hydrogel the s eq value decreased in the following order pana 212 g g pasa 3 160 g g pasa 5 130 g g pasa 1 124 g g pana exhibited the highest water absorbency among the hydrogels because of its crosslinking free character and all the pasa composites exhibited low water absorbency the low values of psass caused the interpenetrating polymer network between sa and pana to inhibit the swelling of the polymer chain moreover water absorbency increased with an increase in the sa content from 1 to 3 wt and decreased with a further increase in the sa content to 5 wt when the sa content was low the increasing water absorbency contributed to the formation of numerous hydrophilic functional groups of sa when the sa content was 5 wt the dense highly crosslinked surface caused a decrease in water absorbency 3 4 adsorption and reusability 3 4 1 adsorption properties the adsorption of ammonium nitrogen of the paa derivatives remain constant within the ph range of 4 0 8 0 34 37 because cooh can easily form from coo in this ph range which decreases the ionization thus the adsorption capacity is low at ph values below 4 therefore we fixed the ph value at approximately 7 0 in the ammonium nitrogen adsorption test the initial concentration of ammonium was 100 mg l fig 7 and table 2 present the results of the ammonium nitrogen adsorption capacity test and the percentage enhancement in the adsorption capacities of the pasa hydrogels compared with that of the pana hydrogel the equilibrium adsorption capacities of all the hydrogels were different these capacities decreased in the followed order pasa 1 12 9 mg g pasa 5 11 7 mg g pasa 3 10 9 mg g pana 10 7 mg g the adsorption capacities of the pasa composites were 1 8 21 1 higher than that of the pana composite the improvement in adsorption capacity for the pasa hydrogels was correlated not only with the increase in the quantity of carboxylate groups with the addition of sa but also the morphological behavior pasa 1 exhibited a higher adsorption capability than did the pasa 3 composite possibly because the more sa hardly interspersed into the pana or ana segment but agglomerates on the surface of the hydrogel resulting more denser and coverage sa surface see the fe sem results therefore the ammonium nitrogen exhibited difficulty in penetrating the hydrogel and was only absorbed by the coverage of the composite however the high number of carboxylate groups from sa on the surface of pasa 5 resulted in the adsorption capacity of pasa 5 being higher than that of pasa 3 thus surface adsorption accounted for a major portion of the adsorption capacity of pasa 5 the adsorption diagram of the pasa hydrogels is displayed in fig 8 3 4 2 effect of adsorption volume on adsorption performance and the adsorption isotherm equation various volumes of nh4cl solution ranging from 10 to 150 ml were used to evaluate the effect of the volume of this solution on the adsorption capacity and ammonia nitrogen removal rate the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency curves of pasa 1 for various nh4cl volumes are illustrated in fig 9a the related data are presented in table 3 the equilibrium adsorption capacity increased but the removal efficiency decreased gradually with an increase in the volume of nh4cl solution these phenomena occurred possibly because of the diffusion effect from higher nh4cl concentration regions to lower nh4cl concentration regions close to the adsorbent the adsorption capacity of the pasa 1 hydrogel at different initial concentrations of nh4cl was studied to obtain its adsorption isotherms fig 9b the corresponding results are summarized in table 4 at an initial nh4cl concentration below 100 mg l the adsorption capacity increased gradually with the nh4cl concentration because of the sufficiency of active adsorption sites when the nh4cl concentration increased these active sites became saturated and nh4cl could not perentrate the hydrogels therefore a marginal decrease in adsorption capacity occurred in addition three adsorption models namely the langmuir eq 4 54 freundlich eq 5 54 57 and temkin eq 6 54 56 57 models were employed to study the surface properties and the adsoprtion connection manner between adsorbent and adsorbate 58 4 1 q e 1 q 0 1 q 0 k l c e 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e 6 q e bln a t bln c e b rt b t where c e is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate mg l q e is the quantity of ammonia nitrogen adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g q o

adsorption intensity a t is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l g b t is the temkin isotherm constant r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature k and b is a constant related to the heat of sorption j mol the correlation coefficients r 2 and isotherm parameters are presented in table 5 in addition the fitting curves are illustrated in figs s2 s4 the r 2 values obtained for the pasa 1 hydrogel with the langmuir freundlich and temkin models were 0 9903 0 9511 and 0 9483 respectively these results suggest that the adsorption process in this study is best explained by the langmuir model which indicates that the surface of the adsorbent was homogeneous and that monolayer adsorption occurred in the present study 59 in addition the q o and k l values calculated using the langmuir model were 188 68 mg g and 9 34 10 4 l mg respectively notably the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity in this study was approximately 40 mg g a gap still existed between the q o and q e values because the temperature concentration immersion time and morphology behavior were not optimized regarding the freundlich model the value of 1 n indicated normal adsorption 54 as presented in table 5 n 1 4612 1 n 0 6844 which indicates that the favorable ammonia nitrogen adsorption occurred in this study for the temkin model the values of a t 6 17 10 2 l g and b 10 6139 j mol were calculated from a plot of q e versus ln c e 3 4 3 adsorption kinetics and adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption kinetics results for pasa 1 are displayed in fig 9c in addition the corresponding kinetic parameters are listed in table 6 the aforementioned results indicated that the adsorption capacity increased considerably for 60 min after which the adsorption capability plateaued the high removal rate indicated the carboxylate salt groups of the hydrogels and the ammonium nitrogen ions interacted with each other the coo functional groups were electrostatically attracted to nh4 in addition the porous morphology of pasa 1 facilitated physical adsorption see the fe sem image in fig 9 therefore the adsorption quantity increased with time however because of the limited adsorption sites and aggregation on the surface adsorption equilibrium was achieved after adsorption had proceeded for a relatively long time in addition the pseudo first order adsorption eq 7 and pseudo second order adsorption eq 8 models 42 60 were employed to study the adsorption kinetics of pasa 1 7 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 8 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q t is the adsorption capacity mg g at time t min q e is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g k 1 is the pseudo first order kinetic constant 1 min and k 2 is the pseudo second order kinetic constant g mg min the parameters of the aforementioned two models were calculated table 6 the correlation coefficients r 2 of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic constants were 0 8581 and 0 9720 respectively thus the pseudo second order kinetic model fit the adsorption kinetics observed in this study better than the pseudo first order model did therefore the adsorption process of pasa 1 was likely related to chemisorption which primarily involves ion exchange 61 62 a pseudo second order kinetic model has been demonstrated to be appropriate for most dye adsorption systems 63 and organic inorganic adsorbents for aqueous solutions 61 the standard free energy δg was calculated using the following equation 42 9 δg r t lnk l where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature k and k l is the langmuir constant the δg value was obtained as 6 99 kj mol which indicated that the ammonium nitrogen adsorption reaction of pasa 1 was a spontaneous reaction 3 4 4 ftir spectra of the pristine adsorption and desorption hydrogels the ftir spectra obtained before after and during the regeneration process of pasa 1 were compared these spectra are displayed in fig s5 after adsorption the signals of the residual carboxylic acid group and carboxylate salt groups from pana shifted to shorter wavenumber regions because of the adsorption of nh4 ions 34 furthermore the signals of the carboxylate salt groups from sa at approximately 1610 and 1415 cm 1 disappeared after regeneration notable increases in intensity were observed at 1636 and 1449 cm 1 carboxylate salt groups from sa and 1530 cm 1 carboxylate salt groups from pana which indicated that the hydrogel had been regenerated 3 4 5 reusability reusability was studied in a qualitative manner for all the hydrogels because reusability is a crucial parameter for ensuring a low process cost and reducing waste the reusability results are illustrated in fig 9d pana exhibited a marginal decrease in its adsorption capacity after nine adsorption desorption cycles furthermore in each cycle the adsorption capacity of the pasa composites decreased as the sa content increased this phenomenon occurred possibly because the sa agglomerates on the surface of the hydrogel prevented the regenerated solution from easily penetrating the hydrogel however pasa 1 still exhibited a higher adsorption capacity than did pana after nine cycles in summary pasa 1 exhibited the most efficient adsorption and regeneration among all the prepared hydrogels and is suitable for practical applications the adsorption desorption interaction for the composites is illustrated in fig 10 4 conclusions in this study pasa hydrogels were created through thermal radical polymerization the created composite hydrogels were assessed through comparisons with pana and sa hydrogels fe sem images revealed that in the composite hydrogels the pore size decreased as the sa content increased the equilibrium water absorbency of the pasa composites was considerably lower than that of the reference pana hydrogel in addition all the pasa hydrogels effectively removed ammonia nitrogen among the examined hydrogels pasa 1 exhibited the highest equilibrium adsorption capacity of 12 9 mg g which was 21 1 higher than that of the reference pana hydrogel the isotherm adsorption of ammonia nitrogen onto pasa 1 fit well with the langmuir model furthermore this hydrogel exhibited the highest adsorption capacity after nine adsorption desorption cycles this study developed an environmentally friendly hydrogel namely pasa 1 for the recovery and

12843,a series of interpenetrating polymer network sodium alginate g poly sodium acrylate pasa hydrogels pasa 1 pasa 3 and pasa 5 were prepared through the thermal radical polymerization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results revealed that all the hydrogels had been prepared successfully the effects of various amounts of sodium alginate sa on various properties were investigated when increasing the amount of sa in pasa polymer the number of pores increased but the size of poores decreased in addition pasa hydrogels presenting crosslinking qualities exhibited relatively low swelling in water finally the synthesized hydrogels were tested as adsorbents for ammonium chloride nh4cl solution the pasa 1 hydrogel exhibited the highest ammonia nitrogen adsorption capacity 12 9

maintained 87 of its adsorption capacity after nine cycles of ammonium nitrogen adsorption desorption graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption desorption ammonium nitrogen aqueous solution hydrogel sodium alginate g poly sodium acrylate 1 introduction water eutrophication has become a major environmental problem worldwide and causes the destruction of aquatic ecosystems 1 4 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n is a wastewater pollutant that often causes water eutrophication 5 water eutrophication can have various environmental impacts such as the excessive growth of algae fish death and poor drinking water quality 4 6 furthermore ammonium nh4 derivatives such as nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 pose serious risks to human health 7 accordingly the removal of nh4 n from eutrophic waters around the world is essential to develop sufficient reusable and low cost materials for nh4 n removal 1 biological treatments such as biological methods 8 9 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation 10 2 chemical treatments such as breakpoint chlorination 11 and chemical precipitation 12 and 3 physical treatments such as ion exchange 13 air stripping 14 microwave radiation 15 and the use of inorganic nanoparticles 16 or organic inorganic adsorbents 17 21 have been developed of these methods the use of organic inorganic adsorbents such as polymer based or polymer inorganic composites has increased considerably in the removal of contaminants from wastewater because of their low cost high efficiency chemical stability ease of handling and reusability 22 26 in addition adsorption application of the nanocomposite hydrogels were deeply reviewed by sharma et al 27 one polymer based material namely poly acrylic acid paa is currently considered a favorable material for nh4 n removal because of its commercial availability low cost and high adsorption efficiency 28 29 cruz et al achieved the rapid removal of nh4 n from domestic wastewater by using paa only hydrogels 28 in our previous study we prepared neutral sodium acrylate ana from acrylic acid and synthesized the related compound poly ana pana under different crosslinker n n methylene bisacrylamide mba and initiator ammonium persulfate aps concentrations 29 pikaar et al investigated the difference between the adsorption capability and swelling behavior of paa and pana hydrogels 30 a balanced crosslinking density and swelling behavior were the key factors required for achieving optimal adsorption desorption properties for further improving the adsorption capabilities mechanical properties and chemical stability of paa hydrogels inorganic components have been added into them to develop modified paa copolymers 31 33 for example wang et al developed several paa composites such as chitosan g paa rectorite 34 chitosan g paa attapulgite 35 paa biotite 36 polyvinyl alcohol paa tourmaline 37 and chitosan g paa unexpanded vermiculite 38 for nh4 n removal the maximum adsorption of these composites was in the range of 21 0 40 6 mg g guan et al synthesized paa g chitosan and biochar composites with a maximum adsorption capacity of 149 25 mg g 39 the results obtained for the paa composite hydrogels mentioned above are also presented in table s1 all the composites exhibited a higher adsorption capacity and adsorption rate for ammonia nitrogen than did paa thus the preparation of paa composites for ammonia nitrogen removal has considerable potential in industry however all the inorganic compounds used in the aforementioned studies have the disadvantage of being difficult to handle therefore they are likely to cause additional pollution new paa composites that are environmentally friendly must be developed for ammonia nitrogen removal sodium alginate sa is a linear biopolymer extracted from seaweed that possesses a ph sensitive nontoxic character and has been widely been used in the medical and food industries 40 therefore this compound is easier to handle than are the aforementioned paa composites furthermore because of the presence of large quantities of carboxylate and hydroxyl groups in sa it has been selected as a favorable superabsorbent for removing dyes from wastewater 31 41 43 to the best of our knowledge sa has not been converted into a composite hydrogel or used in an ammonia nitrogen adsorption system in this study we designed and synthesized a series of sa g poly ana pasa hydrogels containing various quantities of sa pasa hydrogels and reference poly ana pana hydrogels were prepared and used as absorbents to remove nh4 n from aqueous solutions the thermal properties water absorbency nh4 n adsorption capability and reusability of all the prepared hydrogels were assessed in addition adsorption isotherm models were employed to understand the adsorption behavior of ammonium nitrogen on the hydrogel adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials acrylic acid aa 95 alfa aesar aps 98 showa and sa very low viscosity alfa aesar were used without further purification ammonium chloride nh4cl 95 0 showa was purchased and a 100 ppm nh4 n solution was prepared nh4 n was analyzed photometrically by using a 1 00683 0001 spectroquant ammonium test from merck kgaa germany deionized water was purified with a milli q system millipore water 18 2 mω cm 2 2 synthesis of pana sa composite hydrogels overall formulations of the prepared pasa composites are summarized in table 1 a similar quantity of monomer aa and thermal initiator aps as well as various quantities of sa were used to form a series of hydrogels pasa 1 pasa 3 and pasa 5 which contained 1 3 and 5 wt sa respectively in addition reference pana was prepared according to the literature 29 for comparison for preparing pasa 1 aa 5 026 g monomer was first neutralized with sodium hydroxide 1 m to obtain ana with a ph value of approximately 5 in another flask sa 0 532 g was dissolved in deionized water 15 ml at 70 c subsequently the cooled clear sa solution was poured into the ana solution the overall solid content of the resultant solution was 30 wt finally 0 797 g of aps was added to the solution and the mixture was reacted at 70 c for 3 h after polymerization the hydrogel was washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried in a vacuum freeze dryer to a constant weight to obtain the target pasa 1 polymer the weight ratio of aa to sa was 10 1 pana pasa 3 and pasa 5 aa to sa weight ratios of 10 0 10 3 and 10 5 respectively were synthesized using a similar procedure as that described in the aforementioned text a schematic of the preparation of the pasa composites is presented in fig 1 2 3 water absorbency completely dry hydrogel 0 05 g was immersed in excess deionized water 20 ml at room temperature for 72 h to achieve swelling equilibrium the swollen polymer was then separated from the water until it no longer dripped the water absorption value of the hydrogel s eq was calculated using the following equation 44 1 s eq w s w d w d where w d and w s are the weights of the dry and swollen samples respectively the water absorption value s eq was calculated in grams of water per gram of sample 2 4 ammonium nitrogen adsorption measurement ammonium nitrogen adsorption equilibrium experiments were conducted as described in the following text dry hydrogel 0 05 g was first placed into a filter bag and immersed in deionized water for 72 h to achieve swelling equilibrium the filtrate hydrogel was then immersed in standard ammonia nitrogen solution for 1 h for preadsorption at this time the excessive free water in the hydrogel was released subsequently the hydrogel was immersed in 10 ml of sodium hydroxide 1 m solution for 10 min for regeneration with a constant ph value of 7 0 the hydrogel was washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove any residual sodium hydroxide finally the flash swollen hydrogel was immersed in ammonia nitrogen solution 10 ml 100 ppm for 1 h to obtain the adsorption results immersion lasted for 1 h to ensure that adsorption equilibrium was reached 29 the ammonium nitrogen adsorption value of the hydrogel q e was calculated using the following equation 44 2 q e c o c e w v where c o and c e are the initial and adsorption equilibrium concentrations mg l respectively v is the volume of the ammonia nitrogen solution and w is the weight of the initial dry hydrogel the ammonium nitrogen adsorption value q e was calculated in milligrams of ammonium nitrogen per gram of sample 2 5 ammonium nitrogen removal rate the ammonium nitrogen removal rate was calculated as follows 40 3 removal rate c o c e c o 100 2 6 reusability a reusability test was performed to observe the decrease in the adsorption capacity of the hydrogels after several adsorption desorption cycles none of the hydrogels were dissolved in the testing process to prepare for the reusability experiment each adsorbed hydrogel was immersed in 10 ml of sodium hydroxide 1 m solution for 10 min to complete regeneration each hydrogel was then washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove the residual sodium hydroxide on the surface before performing the reusability experiment the readsorption value of the hydrogel was also calculated using eq 2 2 7 measurements fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the samples were obtained by using an ftir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum one a perkin elmer dsc 6000a was used to determine the glass transition temperature t g under a nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 10 c min a differential thermal analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga instrument ta instruments sdt q600 was used to determine the temperature at which the prepared composites exhibited 5 wt weight loss t d under a nitrogen atmosphere when heated from 100 to 800 c at a heating rate of 15 c min the surface morphology of the composites was observed through analytical field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem zeiss auriga the crystallization properties of the composites were determined through x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 the ph value of the composites was measured using a ph meter ph cond tds sal meter 86 505 az the adsorption concentration of ammonium nitrogen was measured using a dynamica halo rb 10 ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer at 25 c in combination with measurements a 1 00683 0001 spectroquant ammonium test from merck subsequently the absorption intensity at approximately 690 nm was obtained and the related adsorption quantity was calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of pana and pasa hydrogels in this study a series of pasa hydrogels were prepared in aqueous solution through the thermal radical polymerization of ana with various quantities of sa and aps fig 1 the compositions of these hydrogels are listed in table 1 aps was first decomposed under heat to generate sulfate anion radicals polymerization was caused by the reaction between sulfate anion radicals and ana monomers moreover reactive alkoxy radicals 45 were produced from sa these radicals reacted with ana or poly ana radicals to generate the sa g pana polymers 46 therefore the interpenetrating polymer network had a pana and sa g pana polymer chain in its structure the sa free hydrogel namely pana was prepared using a similar procedure to that described in the aforementioned text all the samples were insoluble in water which suggested that they were network polymerized in addition all the hydrogels were freeze dried to obtain the target absorbents the freeze drying method resulted in higher porosity than did the traditional heat drying method thus a high adsorption capability was expected to be achieved for the hydrogels prepared using the freeze drying method 42 we then used ftir spectroscopy to confirm the chemical structures of the hydrogels fig 2 illustrates the ftir spectra of the sa pana and pasa compounds the ftir spectra of sa exhibit a broad band at approximately 3500 3000 cm 1 because of the oh bond the bands at 1610 and 1414 cm 1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching peaks of carboxylate salt groups respectively the bands at 1303 cm 1 co stretching 1096 cm 1 co stretching 1031 cm 1 c o c stretching and 949 cm 1 co stretching are attributed to sa s saccharide structure 47 in the spectrum of the pana polymer the band at 1720 cm 1 corresponds to the co bond of the residual carboxylic acid group 48 the symmetrical stretching vibration of carboxylate salt groups appears at 1561 cm 1 furthermore no obvious sharp absorption peaks are located at 1640 cm 1 cc stretching or 1000 and 920 cm 1 c h bending which suggests that the double bond addition reaction was successfully performed for the pasa composites the stretching vibrations of the c oh groups of sa weakened after polymerization which indicated that the oh group of sa was involved in a chain reaction with ana or pana fig 1 46 in addition peaks appeared at approximately 1560 cm 1 carboxylate salt groups from pana and 1415 cm 1 carboxylate salt groups from sa in pasa s spectra 49 moreover the relative intensity at approximately 1415 cm 1 increased when the weight ratios of sa increased 3 2 thermal properties tga and differential scanning calorimetry dsc were conducted to determine the thermal properties of the composites fig 3a illustrates the tga curves and table 2 lists the related data the temperatures at which the samples exhibited 5 wt weight loss t d were determined under a nitrogen atmosphere the t d values ranged from 174 to 213 c and decreased in the following order sa 213 c pana 200 c pasa 1 198 c pasa 5 188 c pasa 3 174 c the sa sodium alginate showed poor thermal stability and decomposed rapidly at around 230 c because of the dehydration decarboxylation and decarbonylation in its structures 50 52 in addition the pasa 1 composite exhibited a higher t d value than did the pasa 3 composite because the pasa 3 composite had a higher sa content this result suggests that sa inhibited the chain growth of pana however pasa 5 which had the highest sa content exhibited a higher t d value than did pasa 3 this result was obtained because the thermal stability of sa which has a high crosslinking density had a stronger influence on t d than did the growth of the pana chain length in summary the chain length and crosslinking density were responsible for the differences in the thermal decomposition temperatures of the composites during the dsc experiments rapid cooling from high temperature to room temperature produced predominantly amorphous samples which allowed the t g values of all the composites to be observed in the second heating traces fig 3b the t g values of the pasa hydrogels were 64 89 c in addition the sa and pana compounds had tg values of 266 c 53 and 117 c respectively the growth of the pana chain was inhibited as sa was added therefore a gradual decrease in t g was observed from pasa 1 to pasa 3 when the content of sa was continually increased up to 5 wt pasa 5 the t g value increased possibly because of the high crosslinking density between pana and sa 46 3 3 surface morphology xrd and water swelling behavior of the composites the surface morphologies of the pana pasa 1 pasa 3 and pasa 5 samples are displayed in the fe sem images in fig 4 the surface of pana fig 4a became rough because of vacuum freeze drying however this surface was still smoother and tighter than those of the other composites the grafting of sa onto pana resulted in the creation of many pores on the surface fig 4b d in addition the pore size decreased with an increase in the sa content and high coverage was observed on the surfaces of pasa 3 and pasa 5 pasa 5 fig 4d exhibited a dense surface because its void spaces were filled by sa chains therefore limited water molecules entered the voids of pasa 5 xrd patterns of the selected dry freeze dried samples pana and pasa 1 are displayed in fig 5 the xrd patterns of pana exhibit wide peaks at 2θ values of approximately 18 6 and 39 2 and the xrd patterns of pasa 1 exhibit wide peaks at 2θ values of approximately 23 5 and 34 9 these results suggests that some crystallinity existed in the aforementioned hydrogels because of the freeze drying synthesis method notably all the 2θ peaks were broad which indicated that parts of the structures were amorphous however the addition of sa increased the intensity of the peaks which suggested that the addition of sa increased the perfection of hydrogel crystallization the effects of the sa content on the swelling properties of the pasa and pana hydrogels were studied none of the hydrogels were soluble in water because they had been polymerized the swelling properties of the aforementioned hydrogels are presented in fig 6 and table 2 in addition fig s1 depicts the preswelling and postswelling images of the pasa 1 hydrogel the s eq value decreased in the following order pana 212 g g pasa 3 160 g g pasa 5 130 g g pasa 1 124 g g pana exhibited the highest water absorbency among the hydrogels because of its crosslinking free character and all the pasa composites exhibited low water absorbency the low values of psass caused the interpenetrating polymer network between sa and pana to inhibit the swelling of the polymer chain moreover water absorbency increased with an increase in the sa content from 1 to 3 wt and decreased with a further increase in the sa content to 5 wt when the sa content was low the increasing water absorbency contributed to the formation of numerous hydrophilic functional groups of sa when the sa content was 5 wt the dense highly crosslinked surface caused a decrease in water absorbency 3 4 adsorption and reusability 3 4 1 adsorption properties the adsorption of ammonium nitrogen of the paa derivatives remain constant within the ph range of 4 0 8 0 34 37 because cooh can easily form from coo in this ph range which decreases the ionization thus the adsorption capacity is low at ph values below 4 therefore we fixed the ph value at approximately 7 0 in the ammonium nitrogen adsorption test the initial concentration of ammonium was 100 mg l fig 7 and table 2 present the results of the ammonium nitrogen adsorption capacity test and the percentage enhancement in the adsorption capacities of the pasa hydrogels compared with that of the pana hydrogel the equilibrium adsorption capacities of all the hydrogels were different these capacities decreased in the followed order pasa 1 12 9 mg g pasa 5 11 7 mg g pasa 3 10 9 mg g pana 10 7 mg g the adsorption capacities of the pasa composites were 1 8 21 1 higher than that of the pana composite the improvement in adsorption capacity for the pasa hydrogels was correlated not only with the increase in the quantity of carboxylate groups with the addition of sa but also the morphological behavior pasa 1 exhibited a higher adsorption capability than did the pasa 3 composite possibly because the more sa hardly interspersed into the pana or ana segment but agglomerates on the surface of the hydrogel resulting more denser and coverage sa surface see the fe sem results therefore the ammonium nitrogen exhibited difficulty in penetrating the hydrogel and was only absorbed by the coverage of the composite however the high number of carboxylate groups from sa on the surface of pasa 5 resulted in the adsorption capacity of pasa 5 being higher than that of pasa 3 thus surface adsorption accounted for a major portion of the adsorption capacity of pasa 5 the adsorption diagram of the pasa hydrogels is displayed in fig 8 3 4 2 effect of adsorption volume on adsorption performance and the adsorption isotherm equation various volumes of nh4cl solution ranging from 10 to 150 ml were used to evaluate the effect of the volume of this solution on the adsorption capacity and ammonia nitrogen removal rate the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency curves of pasa 1 for various nh4cl volumes are illustrated in fig 9a the related data are presented in table 3 the equilibrium adsorption capacity increased but the removal efficiency decreased gradually with an increase in the volume of nh4cl solution these phenomena occurred possibly because of the diffusion effect from higher nh4cl concentration regions to lower nh4cl concentration regions close to the adsorbent the adsorption capacity of the pasa 1 hydrogel at different initial concentrations of nh4cl was studied to obtain its adsorption isotherms fig 9b the corresponding results are summarized in table 4 at an initial nh4cl concentration below 100 mg l the adsorption capacity increased gradually with the nh4cl concentration because of the sufficiency of active adsorption sites when the nh4cl concentration increased these active sites became saturated and nh4cl could not perentrate the hydrogels therefore a marginal decrease in adsorption capacity occurred in addition three adsorption models namely the langmuir eq 4 54 freundlich eq 5 54 57 and temkin eq 6 54 56 57 models were employed to study the surface properties and the adsoprtion connection manner between adsorbent and adsorbate 58 4 1 q e 1 q 0 1 q 0 k l c e 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e 6 q e bln a t bln c e b rt b t where c e is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate mg l q e is the quantity of ammonia nitrogen adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g q o

adsorption intensity a t is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l g b t is the temkin isotherm constant r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature k and b is a constant related to the heat of sorption j mol the correlation coefficients r 2 and isotherm parameters are presented in table 5 in addition the fitting curves are illustrated in figs s2 s4 the r 2 values obtained for the pasa 1 hydrogel with the langmuir freundlich and temkin models were 0 9903 0 9511 and 0 9483 respectively these results suggest that the adsorption process in this study is best explained by the langmuir model which indicates that the surface of the adsorbent was homogeneous and that monolayer adsorption occurred in the present study 59 in addition the q o and k l values calculated using the langmuir model were 188 68 mg g and 9 34 10 4 l mg respectively notably the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity in this study was approximately 40 mg g a gap still existed between the q o and q e values because the temperature concentration immersion time and morphology behavior were not optimized regarding the freundlich model the value of 1 n indicated normal adsorption 54 as presented in table 5 n 1 4612 1 n 0 6844 which indicates that the favorable ammonia nitrogen adsorption occurred in this study for the temkin model the values of a t 6 17 10 2 l g and b 10 6139 j mol were calculated from a plot of q e versus ln c e 3 4 3 adsorption kinetics and adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption kinetics results for pasa 1 are displayed in fig 9c in addition the corresponding kinetic parameters are listed in table 6 the aforementioned results indicated that the adsorption capacity increased considerably for 60 min after which the adsorption capability plateaued the high removal rate indicated the carboxylate salt groups of the hydrogels and the ammonium nitrogen ions interacted with each other the coo functional groups were electrostatically attracted to nh4 in addition the porous morphology of pasa 1 facilitated physical adsorption see the fe sem image in fig 9 therefore the adsorption quantity increased with time however because of the limited adsorption sites and aggregation on the surface adsorption equilibrium was achieved after adsorption had proceeded for a relatively long time in addition the pseudo first order adsorption eq 7 and pseudo second order adsorption eq 8 models 42 60 were employed to study the adsorption kinetics of pasa 1 7 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 8 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q t is the adsorption capacity mg g at time t min q e is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g k 1 is the pseudo first order kinetic constant 1 min and k 2 is the pseudo second order kinetic constant g mg min the parameters of the aforementioned two models were calculated table 6 the correlation coefficients r 2 of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic constants were 0 8581 and 0 9720 respectively thus the pseudo second order kinetic model fit the adsorption kinetics observed in this study better than the pseudo first order model did therefore the adsorption process of pasa 1 was likely related to chemisorption which primarily involves ion exchange 61 62 a pseudo second order kinetic model has been demonstrated to be appropriate for most dye adsorption systems 63 and organic inorganic adsorbents for aqueous solutions 61 the standard free energy δg was calculated using the following equation 42 9 δg r t lnk l where r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature k and k l is the langmuir constant the δg value was obtained as 6 99 kj mol which indicated that the ammonium nitrogen adsorption reaction of pasa 1 was a spontaneous reaction 3 4 4 ftir spectra of the pristine adsorption and desorption hydrogels the ftir spectra obtained before after and during the regeneration process of pasa 1 were compared these spectra are displayed in fig s5 after adsorption the signals of the residual carboxylic acid group and carboxylate salt groups from pana shifted to shorter wavenumber regions because of the adsorption of nh4 ions 34 furthermore the signals of the carboxylate salt groups from sa at approximately 1610 and 1415 cm 1 disappeared after regeneration notable increases in intensity were observed at 1636 and 1449 cm 1 carboxylate salt groups from sa and 1530 cm 1 carboxylate salt groups from pana which indicated that the hydrogel had been regenerated 3 4 5 reusability reusability was studied in a qualitative manner for all the hydrogels because reusability is a crucial parameter for ensuring a low process cost and reducing waste the reusability results are illustrated in fig 9d pana exhibited a marginal decrease in its adsorption capacity after nine adsorption desorption cycles furthermore in each cycle the adsorption capacity of the pasa composites decreased as the sa content increased this phenomenon occurred possibly because the sa agglomerates on the surface of the hydrogel prevented the regenerated solution from easily penetrating the hydrogel however pasa 1 still exhibited a higher adsorption capacity than did pana after nine cycles in summary pasa 1 exhibited the most efficient adsorption and regeneration among all the prepared hydrogels and is suitable for practical applications the adsorption desorption interaction for the composites is illustrated in fig 10 4 conclusions in this study pasa hydrogels were created through thermal radical polymerization the created composite hydrogels were assessed through comparisons with pana and sa hydrogels fe sem images revealed that in the composite hydrogels the pore size decreased as the sa content increased the equilibrium water absorbency of the pasa composites was considerably lower than that of the reference pana hydrogel in addition all the pasa hydrogels effectively removed ammonia nitrogen among the examined hydrogels pasa 1 exhibited the highest

12844,in this study a heterogeneous catalyst derived from iron containing waste mineral was enriched by magnetic composite fe3 fe2 at modification ratio of 5 for the highest mineralization of ofloxacin ofl by ozone fenton system a comparative study between o3 perozone h2o2 and o3 fenton systems in mineralization of ofloxacin ofl under various solution ph h2o2 dosages initial ofl

catalyst dosage of 1 5 g l h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l with initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l due to synergistic effect of o3 and fenton reagent the catalyst s properties were evaluated through bet sem image eds and mapping data ftir and xrd the main mineralization mechanism of ofl was through hydroxyl radicals oh which were formed during ozonation process because feo fe3o4 and sio2 in the mfs 5 s constituent accelerated decomposition of o3 and promoted reaction rate with h2o2 the catalyst exhibited a good reusability and stability after five consecutive runs with negligible change in mineralization efficiency of ofl and a very low leached iron amount into solution besides there was an efficient improvement of biodegradability of real pharmaceutical wastewater after treatment by o3 fenton with 71 and 62 removal of cod and toc respectively these findings indicated utilizing magnetic modified waste iron mineral as heterogeneous catalyst in combination with h2o2 and o3 achieved high efficiency and feasibility in removal of ofl antibiotic from real pharmaceutical wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ofloxacin ozonation ozone fenton modified heterogeneous catalyst synergetic effect 1 introduction antibiotics pollution in the water bodies has become a major concern worldwide 1 among antibiotics fluoroquinolones are wide spectrum anti bacterial which have attracted much attention in recent years due to an increasing apply in hospitals households and veterinary applications they are the third largest group of antibiotics making up 17 of the global market share 2 these pharmaceuticals residues are discharged into receiving sources through many routes consisting of disposal of human and other organisms urine and feces wastewater from hospital and pharmaceutical production and effluent of wastewater treatment plants which have risen concerns related with antibiotic occurrence in water resources the residual antibiotics are persistent and low biodegradable with their half life times of 10 6 days in surface water 3 and up to 580 days in soil matrices 4 ofloxacin ofl is an important fluoroquinolone antibiotics which is widely used in treatment of infectious diseases 5 however there is only about 30 of ofl absorbed and metabolized by human and other organisms body the 70 left amount of ofl has been discharged into receiving water bodies including surface drinking water and wastewater enhancing generation of antibiotic resistance microbial populations 2 it is reported that the ofl was found in surface water at concentrations of 31 7 μg l 5 the existence of the ofl in water environment is proved to be harmful for human health and ecosystem even at very low concentration it has become evident that most popularly applied ofl and other fluoroquinolone antibiotics are toxic carcinogenic and genotoxic for organisms 6 because of abovementioned concerns advanced treatment technologies are required for removal of the ofl from water medium and wastewater the biological method is effective eco friendly and low cost for treatment of highly polluted industrial wastewaters 5 7 however the biological technology applying various microorganisms for treatment of persistent organic pollutants pops containing wastewater possesses several drawbacks such as low efficiency requirement of long sludge retention time and easy in loading shock due to high toxicity of pops for microbial 5 7 8 recently advanced oxidation processes aops have been popularly used and favored in pre treatment of pops from wastewater to improve bod5 cod ratio to facilitate for following biological treatment 7 besides the aops are suitable to remove residues in effluent of secondary treatment in wastewater treatment plants the reason the aops favored in removal of pops are due to continuously generation of oxidizing agents like hydroxyl radicals oh which can unselectively attack aromatic rings of organic matters and mineralize them to non toxic end products of co2 and h2o 7 9 10 among the aops ozone based systems and fenton reaction have been applied the most commonly 7 10 ozone based treatment methods have recently received considerably attention because of their effectiveness and oxidation potential in degradation of antibiotic residues from wastewaters 11 12 for example tay and madehi 2015 13 reported ozonation of ofloxacin catazone of ofl using mnox ceox γ al2o3 as a catalyst 14 chen and wang 2020 15 studied on degradation of ofloxacin by o3 and perozone o3 h2o2 tokumura et al 2016 16 investigated removal of carbamazepine and diclofenac by perozone o3 h2o2 treatment of ciprofloxacin using o3 titanium dioxide montmorillonite tio2 mmt nanocomposite 12 electro peroxone for degradation of levofloxacin 1 and amoxicillin 17 decontamination of sulfamethoxazole 18 and amoxicillin 19 by nanocomposite oxidation of organic compounds through ozonation is attributed directly by ozone or and by oh or the combination of both direct ozone oxidation is favored under acidic conditions whereas higher ph values lead to the generation of oxidant species such as oh positively affecting the efficiency of the treatment 11 besides fenton oxidation is also an effective method in antibiotic degradation 20 the fenton reactions are divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton in the fenton reaction the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts decomposed h2o2 to o2 and h2o to form a huge amount of oh radicals 21 in recently the fenton reactions have been successful in degradation of various antibiotics such as fenton oxidation of ofloxacin using montmorillonite fe3o4 composite 22 heterogeneous photo fenton catalyzed by biogenic femn oxides for removal of ofl 23 degradation of ofloxacin amoxicillin and tetracycline by heterogeneous catalytic fenton mnfe2o4 c nh2 24 removal of ofl by heterogeneous catalytic fenton cdta modified alginate 25 heterogeneous fenton like degradation of ofloxacin 26 photo fenton in removal of carbamazepine and diclofenac 16 amoxicillin 27 although both ozonation and fenton oxidation processes are very effective and popular in the removal of antibiotics but both processes possesses several disadvantages which have limited their application in mineralization of persistent organic compounds the drawbacks consisted of generation of undesirable iron sludge loss of the catalyst in the effluent need for ph adjustment before and after reaction homogeneous fenton process 28 high cost and difficult in separation of catalyst after reaction heterogeneous fenton process 28 and electricity and low effectiveness in degradation of pollutants even incompletely mineralization of pops ozonation 11 for these reasons it is desirable to combine two or more aops simultaneously in order to increase the oxidation rate and shorten reaction time by enhancing the production of more oh radicals leading to higher efficiencies than using the single processes thus to improve the oxidizing power of ozone a combination of ozonation with several other aops has been developed and these methods have already found a wide spread application in the treatment of wastewater 29 among integrated aops the combination of ozonation with homogeneous fenton process was proved to reach a peak in removal of organic pollutants with a minimal operational cost compared with other processes under the same operational conditions for instance beltral heredia et al 2001 30 conducted a comparative study about removal efficiency of several oxidation processes in degradation of p hydroxybenzoic acid the authors reported the highest mineralization efficiency was obtained by o3 h2o2 fe2 wu and ng 2008 31 used ozone based systems for decolorization of c i reactive red 2 rr2 and found that the combinations of h2o2 fe3 with o3 gave a higher decolorization rate than that of o3 and consumed 62 energy compared with o3 system removal of terephthalic acid containing wastewater by a combination process of o3 h2o2 fe2 uv showed the highest oxidizing efficiency of 90 of cod at 240 min which was higher than those of other aops 29 the ozone fenton for stabilizing leachate was investigated by amr and azir 2012 32 in 2013 zeng et al 21 studied on degradation of phenol by o3 fenton and reported that phenol degradation rate in o3 fenton was 20 higher than that in o3 process at ph of 6 8 degradation of endocrine disrupting compound diethyl phthalate dep by o3 fenton reagents was investigated by mansouri et al 2015 33 the results indicated the synergetic effect of o3 and fenton reagent was because ozone accelerated fenton reagents to form more oh leading to enhancement of dep degradation the integration of o3 photo fenton for treating industrial effluent reached 100 of decolor and 95 5 of cod removal was studied by asaithambi et al 2016 10 most recently sanchis et all 2018 7 reported the o3 solar photo fenton for treatment of industrial effluent with removal efficiencies of cod and toc respectively reached 67 and 62 clearly there have been studies on combination between o3 and homogeneous fenton in degradation of various pops with a higher removal efficiency than those of alone aops however to the best of our knowledge there has no studies on the integration of o3 with heterogeneous catalytic fenton in treatment of ofloxacin from wastewater until now this can be due to high cost and difficult in recovery of used heterogeneous catalysts therefore the searching a low cost catalyst towards utilization a solid waste to fabricate a heterogeneous catalyst for aops has important significant the utilization several argriculture by products to fabricate biochar from herbaceous biomass in combination with nanomaterials 34 or bre brewer s spent grain waste for production of activated carbon and carbon nanotubes 35 as heterogeneous catalyst for aops have been studied on the circular economy by converting low value lignocellulosic materials into added value products 36 37 in vietnam there are a huge amount of mineral mines corresponding with a discharge of large amount of metal slags among these waste metal slags the iron slag was utilized as catalyst and composite catalyst in fenton oxidation of dyes in our previous works with high removal efficiency of pollutants 38 39 thus in the present study a heterogeneous catalyst derived from iron containing natural mineral enriched by magnetic composite was developed this catalyst provided an interesting solution permitting easy fast and low cost separation by application of an external magnetic field feasibility in its recovery and reusability specially the integrated o3 heterogeneous catalytic fenton like process is expected to generate synergistic effects to rise the process efficiency by direct ozonation and generation of more hydroxyl radicals favored at basic ph and or decomposition of o3 to oh in presence of magnetic modified waste iron slag mfs the aim of this study therefore was to modify the waste iron slag by magnetic composite in order to use as heterogeneous catalyst for fenton process in combination with ozone formed from oxygen in atmosphere to mineralize the ofloxacin from wastewater a comparative investigation of the performance of three systems including ozonation o3 perozone o3 h2o2 and integrated o3 fenton like o3 h2o2 mfs in the mineralization of ofl was performed characteristics of magnetic enriched waste iron slag catalyst were fully determined besides effect of operational parameters on removal efficiency of ofl by ozonation processes was investigated especially kinetic and mechanism of the ofl mineralization by ozonation systems were systematically studied the feasibility in practical application of o3 fenton system was evaluated through treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater and stability of modified catalyst 2 materials and method 2 1 materials and chemicals the ofloxacin ofl was used as target organic pollutant which represented for fluoroquinolone antibiotics causing the harmful problem in wastewater the ofloxacin ofl c18h20fn3o4 molecular weight of 361 368 g mol with analytical grade was obtained from katayama chemical co japan and was applied as received without further purification a stock solution of ofl was prepared by dissolving exactly 1 0 g of ofl in 1000 ml of double distilled water the ofl solutions at desired concentrations were achieved by diluting the stock ofl using ddw the real pharmaceutical wastewater was collected from collection tank in wastewater treatment plant of saigon pharmaceutical company sapharco in ho chi minh city vietnam the hydrogen peroxide 30 w w was provided by katayama chemical co japan and used as an oxidizing agent in ozonation reactions the naoh and h2so4 1 m for adjusting solution ph and fecl3 and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o for modification of raw iron slag were purchased from taanjin china the o3

bubbled through the ofl wastewater in the reactor through an air bubble stone diffuser placed at bottom of ozone reactor the gas flow rate and concentration of ozone were controlled at 0 276 g min and 0 091 g l respectively the waste iron slag fs was collected from ferrous and non ferrous metallurgy processes at thai nguyen province vietnam 2 2 preparation of catalysts after collected from thai nguyen non ferrous metals limited company the fs was dried at 105 c for 48 h the dried fs was then blend and sieved to achieve particles with size 0 25 mm the obtained fs was continuously used for modification by magnetic mixture of fe3 fe2 at certain ratios in modification procedure of the fs by mixture of fe3 fe2 the mixture of fe3 fe2 was firstly formed using fecl3 and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o at a fe3 fe2 ratio of 2 1 the modified iron slag mfs was generated by mixing fs with mixture of fe3 fe2 at modification ratios of 5 10 15 and 20 w w of mixture of fe3 fe2 fs to obtain 10 0 g of mfs at various modification ratios the mixing ratios between fs fecl3 and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o are presented in table 1 the detail description of the modification procedure was as follows at the begining of the process the mixture of fecl3 and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o with weight ratios as shown in the table 1 was dissolved into a beaker of 20 ml ddw a certain amount of fs as indicated in table 1 was then added in this mixture with completely stirring the mixture was filled with ddw to 50 ml and adjusted ph until 11 using naoh 1 m the mixture was then shaken at 120 rpm for 6 8 h subsequently the mixture was filtered to obtain solid catalyst the solid catalyst was then dried at 105 c for 4 h following that the dried solid catalyst was blend to form fine particles finally the modified waste iron slag catalysts were stored in sealed plastic containers and labeled as mfs 5 mfs 10 mfs 15 mfs 20 in order to use for further experiments 2 3 experiments design in this study the ozonation experiments of ofloxacin were conducted in the semi batch mode the general schematic diagram for setting up the experiments of the ofl mineralization by ozonation systems is illustrated in fig a1 all experiments were conducted in a 1 2 l tubular borosilicate glass ozone reactor with a height of 450 mm and inner diameter of 60 mm the ozonation reactor was installed with gas input and output and sampling equipment the ozone reactor contained 500 ml of ofl solution at certain concentration was simultaneously supplemented with catalyst at different conditions of solution ph and catalyst dosage under fluidized state ozone gas was generated from atmospheric oxygen using a ozone generator ozone fresh ozima sp f1 g 4 sinh phu technology development joint stock company vietnam at a fixed flow rate and concentration of ozone of 0 276 g min and 0 091 g l respectively the aqueous ozone concentration into the reactor was adjusted by changing the flow rate of the feed air the reactor contained 500 ml of ofl solution and catalyst dosages varying from 0 5 to 2 5 g l the solution in the reactor was completely stirred using an air bubble stone placed in the bottom of the reactor the sample was taken out at regular time interval of each 20 min in whole 100 min of reaction time in the perozone o3 h2o2 and integrated ozone fenton like o3 h2o2 mfs various dosages of h2o2 ranged from 50 mg l to 250 mg l was added in the reactor the solution ph was changed between 3 5 7 9 and 11 the o3 escaped from top of the reactor was captured in conical flask containing 2000 ml of 2 ki solution to destruct the excess ozone 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 the characteristics of catalyst the properties of raw and modified catalysts at optimal modification ratio were assessed through bet sem images eds and mapping data ftir and xrd spectrum the textural characteristics of fs and mfs at optimal composite ratio were analyzed using n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k quantachrome instruments version 11 0 nova the surface morphologies of catalysts were observed using electron microscope analysis sem at 2 0 kv with various magnification the eds and mapping data were obtained by using jsm it200 intouchscop meanwhile the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of catalyst particles were determined by a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer using cu kα as the x ray source the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was analyzed between 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 using ftir 6300 equipment the phzpc was determined using drift method 39 2 4 2 determination of mineralization degree of ofl degradation efficiency of ofl was measured using uv vis spectrophotometer shimazu model z2000 japan at λ 293 nm the solution ph was detected by a ph meter si analytics the leaching iron concentrations into solution were monitored by coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model ultima expert horiba france the concentrations of h2o2 were determined by the iodometric titration method 40 the total organic carbon toc was detected by a toc 4200 analyzer shimadzu japan the mineralization efficiency of ofl after ozonation was determined by analyzing chemical oxygen demand cod concentration following standard method 5220 41 all parameters in real pharmaceutical wastewater such as bod5 tss were determined according to standard method the concentrations of o3 in the solution was detected

excel microsoft and origin 9 0 sofwares were used to treat the obtained experimental data the results were expressed as average value standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of the modification ratio in this study the experiments to study effect of magnetic modification ratio on the removal efficiency of ofl by o3 fenton was performed with varying impregnation ratios between mixture of fe3 fe2 and fs at 5 10 15 and 20 w w at h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l catalyst dosage of 1 5 g l under ph of 9 during 100 min of contact time the ofl mineralization efficiency was evaluated through removal efficiency of cod the results are presented in fig 2 what stands out from data in fig 1 is that the ofl removal efficiency in o3 mfs systems was higher than that in o3 fs the mineralization efficiency of ofl by o3 fenton using modified fs at a composite ratio of 5 mfs 5 reached a peak of 70 however there are no correlation between modification ratios with the ofl removal efficiencies to be specific the ofl removal efficiency saw a fall trend when composite ratios were further increased over 5 the higher modification ratios were the lower ofl removal efficiencies were the mineralization efficiency of ofl was 50 96 44 83 and 38 69 by o3 fenton respectively at composite ratios of 10 15 and 20 of fe3 fe2 mixture a high impregnation ratio of fe3 fe2 can caused consumption of oh in the presence of organic compounds 43 besides molar ratio between fenton reagent and h2o2 also affected the mineralization of stabilized leachate 32 in this study the author showed the removal efficiency of cod color and nh3 n was the highest at a molar ratio between h2o2 fe2 of 1 moreover the catalyst s surface active sites became saturating and overlapping by attack of iron ions at a high composite ratio the similar results were reported by ling et al 2011 44 who studied on loading of fe iii on activated carbon as catalyst for improving heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of omethoate with optimal composite ratio of fe iii at 5 these results can be further confirmed through the catalysts properties data specifically the xrd pattern illustrated the occurrence of feo and fe3o4 in mainly constituent of mfs 5 with mass ratio was higher in comparison with fs by two times eds data as a result it is clear that the impregnation of fs in mixture of fe3 fe2 significantly improved the ofl removal efficiency and at impregnation ratio of 5 for the maximum ofl mineralization efficiency thus the mfs 5 was chosen as heterogeneous catalyst for the integrated o3 fenton in degradation of ofl in the following investigations 3 2 characteristics of catalyst the textural and surface chemical characteristics of fs and mfs 5 are expressed in table 2 the data in table 2 showed that both fs and mfs 5 belong to non porous material the increase in sbet of modified catalyst compared with raw catalyst was due to synergetic effects among the components such as enriched feo fe3o4 and sio2 in the mfs 5 constituent after modification process it is noticeable that growth in sbet of catalyst mfs 5 by about 7 5 times through modifying by mixture of magnetic would facilitate the separation of charge carries surface catalytic activity and redox sites in the catalyst structures leading to improve electron transfer of magnetic composite catalyst besides the high sbet of mfs 5 is beneficial for adsorption of ofl on the mfs 5 s surface which resulted in improving oxidation performance of ofl adsorbed on the catalyst surface by oh radicals 18 the surface morphology of fs and mfs 5 catalysts was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem and the results are illustrated in fig 3a d from the fig 3a d both fs and mfs 5 had the amorphous structure coarse and heterogeneous surface the data also show that both catalysts belong to porous material but the porous structure on the mfs 5 was more clearly moreover after modified by mixture of fe3 fe2 the presence of both feo and fe3o4 on the surface of fs produces more dispersed particles the mfs 5 possessed many particles with the smaller and rougher structure in comparison with particles of fs the surface of mfs 5 composite is fully covered due to the large amount of feo and fe3o4 immobilized in the composite resulting in the surfaces of mfs 5 composite coarser than that of raw fs besides the modification process makes iron ions reacted and destructed the large particles structure of raw fs into smaller particles the results confirmed the successful loading of mixture fe3 fe2 on the raw fs generating mfs 5 composite the presence of fe and other elements are exhibited by eds and mapping data in fig 2c f and b e the iron occurred on the mfs at optimal modification ratio of 5 was higher than of in fs by about twice besides there was presence of o al si and s in constituent of both fs and mfs 5 such the change in the mass ratio of iron on the surface of the mfs 5 composite would lead to a remarkable growth in catalytic activity thanks to change in the active sites available in the catalyst s surface the results further confirm that the iron ions were successfully loaded onto raw fs catalyst resulting in promoting degradation rate of the ofl by ozone fenton systems using mfs 5 as catalyst chemical bonds on the surface of fs and mfs 5 were studied using ftir and the spectra are illustrated in fig 3a the occurrence of bands at about 450 and 551 cm 1 are attributed to al o si and si o si deformations 22 the absorption band at about 798 cm 1 represents to sio in sio2 28 the band at about 988 cm 1 proved the presence of al al oh bending vibration while that at 1095 cm 1 is due to the sio stretching 28 there was the vibration of hydroxyl groups oh stretching appeared at a peak of 3000 and 3500 cm 1 can be assigned for al oh in both fs and mfs 5 45 the peak at 1735 cm 1 is related to the bending mode of these hydroxyl groups 46 cc groups at peaks ranging from 2353 cm 1 in fs is moved to 2296 cm 1 in mfs 5 the co groups were also observed at peaks from 1013 to 1209 cm 1 after modified by magnetic composite the peaks within 1500 1329 cm 1 which represented coo groups appeared in mfs 5 are less intense compared to those of raw fs due to interaction between fe2 and fe3 and the oxygen of coo groups because the carboxyl group plays the key role in metal adsorption moreover this result can also be due to link of iron ions with alo and sio in raw iron slag 45 the xrd patterns of both fs and mfs at various modification ratios are illustrated in fig 3b it can be seen from data in fig 3b that all catalysts had amorphous structure the presence of feo fe3 so4 2 oh 6 fe3o4 and sio2 in the fig 3b further confirmed data in sem ftir and eds and mapping data among synthesized catalysts it is clear that amount of both hematite feo and magnetite fe3o4 occurred in the mfs 5 was the highest almost characteristic peaks were well indexed to amorphous with a highly graphite crystal structure in the xrd spectra of all catalysts 38 the result of the xrd patterns indicates the main constituent supported for ozone fenton process to mineralize ofl antibiotic was mainly thanks to occurrence of ferrous dioxide and silicon dioxide in fs and mfs 5 3 3 comparison of different processes in removal of ofl to study synergic effect and participation of various treatment processes in removal of ofl a series of experiments were conducted to compare the ofl treatment efficiency between processes for reactors the h2o2 dosage was fixed at 100 mg l mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l and initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l all experiments were performed under same ph of 9 0 at room temperature 25 2 c time course of ofl removal by different treatment processes and catalytic potential is indicated in fig 4 from data in fig 4a among these treatment processes the adsorption of ofl by mfs 5 was considered control test the removal of ofl by adsorption onto mfs 5 was found to be 8 9 for 100 min of contact time a low value in the ofl removal efficiency by adsorption onto mfs 5 suggested the contribution of adsorption in removal of ofl was inconsiderable similarly oxidation of ofl from water by h2o2 oxidizing agent only was low 8 7 equaling with the ofl removal by adsorption onto mfs 5 however a combination between h2o2 and mfs 5 heterogeneous catalyst in fenton system gave a growth in the ofl degradation efficiency up 18 09 which was higher than that of total efficiencies of both oxidation by h2o2 and adsorption onto mfs 5 for ozonation of ofl by alone ozone oxidizing agent degradation of ofl reached 26 63 the low ofl oxidation efficiency was due to low utilization rate of ozone and selective attack of ozone 48 when the h2o2 was added into ozonation the perozone efficiency of ofl reached 52 12 which was higher than that of two times by o3 in the heterogeneous catalytic catazone o3 mfs 5 the ofl degradation efficiency was 53 98 which was the same as the oxidation efficiency of perozone process however there was a noticeable upward trend in the ofl removal efficiency when o3 was integrated with fenton reagent h2o2 mfs 5 in the o3 fenton system the ofl degradation efficiency peaked at 70 0 this value was higher than that of sum of degradation efficiencies of both o3 only and fenton h2o2 mfs 5 44 72 by about 1 6 times from the results as can be seen the o3 fenton for the highest removal efficiency of ofl from aqueous solution the supplementation of fenton reagent into ozonation system enhanced the ofl degradation efficiency went up 43 37 the results was attributed to be fenton reagent accelerated decomposing o3 to form more oh a integrated treatment process of o3 and fenton has been found to generate the synergetic effects between o3 and fenton like oxidation leading to enhancement of overall degradation efficiency of ofl and overcoming their respective drawbacks 10 the integrated treatment process was initiated with oxidation of h2o2 by iron ions which were contained in the constituent of mfs 5 catalyst through fenton s reaction to form the main sources of oh then the reaction continued to be further catalyzed through reduction of fe3 as well as fe3 ions reaction with o3 to form more oh for attack into aromatic ring structure of ofl as described by following equations 10 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 4 fe 3 h 2 o fe 2 h oh 5 fe 3 o 3 feo 2 h o 2 oh the analogue results were reported by several previous works on studying combination of o3 and homogeneous fenton in degradation of various persistent organic pollutant for example li et al 2015 49 investigated degradation of amoxicillin by o3 fenton using rotating packed bed rpb the results showed that cod removal rate reached a peak of 65 and bod5 cod ratio was grown from 0 to 0 38 after o3 fenton treatment the result was due to synergic effect between o3 and fenton the stabilized leachate was treated using the o3 fenton process 32 after treated the degradation efficiency of cod was increased while o3 consumption decreased by the addition of fenton reagent into the ozonation system the synergistic effect between catalyst and oxidants in the o3 fenton system was also proved in some previous works using catalytic potential and enhancement factor r 50 based on data obtained from the recent study both the catalytic potential of mfs 5 and the synergistic effect between various applied processes in integrated o3 fenton system were determined using eqs 6 and 7 respectively in eq 6 the removal efficiency of ofl by integrated process was compared with that those achieved by individual mfs 5 h2o2 and o3 systems the synergistic effect was described based on enhancement factor r as explained in eq 7 herein the removal efficiency of ofl by o3 and h2o2 mfs 5 and by integrated o3 fenton processes was compared referring to eq 7 a significant catalytic potential of 52 1 was obtained for mfs 5 during o3 mfs 5 h2o2 process fig 4b showing that the coupling of fenton agent and o3 for the degradation of ofl was effective technique this result was due to the efficient formation of hydroxyl radicals via effectively decomposition of o3 and h2o2 molecules by both si and fe ions on the catalyst constituents besides towards enhancement factor the values of r are defined between 0 and 1 0 when r 1 0 displaying the integrated effect is lower than sum of the single effects while at r 1 shows the integrated effect is much higher than sum of the individual effects at r 1 the integrated effect equals sum of the individual effects in this study from data in the fig 4a the value of r was calculated to be 1 58 demonstrating the significant synergistic effect between applied techniques in o3 fenton system therefore integrated o3 fenton system was chosen as the most effective process in removal of ofl at next experiments 6 r r o 3 fenton r mfs 5 r o 3 r h 2 o 2 7 r ofl removed by o 3 fenton ofl removed by o 3 h 2 o 2 mfs 5 3 4 effect of solution ph the solution ph plays a vital roles in ozonation of ofl in this study the experiment to study effect of solution ph on the ofl mineralization by ozonation perozone and ozone fenton systems was conducted by varying solution ph values between 3 5 7 9 and 11 with fixing initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l during 100 min of reaction time time course of ofl mineralization is shown in fig 5 from data in fig 5 it is clear that ozonation degradation of ofl was favored in alkaline medium and the degradation of ofl by all ozonation systems maximized at ph of 9 the ofl removal efficiency of o3 perozone and o3 fenton reached respectively 26 63 52 17 and 69 09 at ph of 9 the result showed that ozone decomposition strongly depended on ph value of the solution and basic ph is beneficial to ozone decomposition to generate more oh leading to promoting the degradation of ofl 11 besides the degradation of persistent organic compounds by heterogeneous fenton was also proved to be effective at high ph 26 this result was because the growth in hydroxyl ion concentration enhanced the hydroxyl radicals generation through hydroxyl ion reaction with o3 according to following equations 32 8 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 9 o 3 ho 2 2o 2 oh and the indirect oxidation reaction proceeds at a quicker rate under ph of 9 moreover the surface charge analysis results of mfs 5 showed that the phzpc of catalyst was 9 8 at solution ph of 9 phzpc the surface of mfs 5 became positively charge besides the ofl is a zwitterionic compound containing an equal number of positively and negatively charged functional groups in solution with two pka values of 6 10 and 8 28 51 because of these properities the ofl molecules were often negatively charged or positively charged depending on solution ph values the previous study showed that the ofl molecules are negatively charged at ph 8 28 52 as a result there was a high adsorption tendency between catalyst and contaminant molecules at solution ph of 9 through electrostatic interactions leading to a remarkable promotion in the performance of ofl degradation process also xrd and eds data indicated there was feo and fe3o4 existed in constituent of mfs 5 catalyst the fe3o4 was proved to be exhibition effective catalytic activity for promoting ozone decomposition into oh radicals in alkaline medium 48 and among ozonation systems the ozone fenton gave the highest removal efficiency of ofl this can be due to adding fenton reagent into ozonation reaction enhanced effective generation of more oh radicals for degradation of ofl from water 10 29 31 32 however a further increase in ph value to 11 led a fall in removal efficiency of ofl this was due to a excess amount of radicals caused by dissociation of h2o2 which triggered a decreased effectiveness of ozone when reacting with ofl 32 the analogue results were achieved by previous studies for example treatment efficiency of matured landfill leachate using o3 fenton reached peak at ph of 7 9 32 ozonation of landfill leachate with cod removal efficiency of 41 at ph of 11 53 degradation of textile wastewater by solar photo fenton o3 was maximum at ph of 9 7 treatment of tpa wastewater by o3 h2o2 fe2 uv reached a peak at ph of 8 5 29 however the results were contrasted with those reached in study of li et al 2015 49 who applied o3 fenton for degradation amx with a maximum removal efficiency of amx of 48 9 at ph of 3 the reason of this result was due to a decrease of the fe ii availability at high ph leading to inhibition of the reaction between h2o2 and fe ii in homogeneous fenton to form oh 3 5 effect of h2o2 concentration in perozone reaction the presence of h2o2 is considered initiation agent for degradation of o3 through hydroperoxite ho2 ho2 continues to react with o3 to form o3 and ho2 after finishing a reaction chain total 2 oh is generated as described by following equation 10 h 2 o 2 2o 3 2 oh 3o 2 also in fenton reaction h2o2 directly reacts with fe2 and fe3 ions in constituent of modified iron slag to form oh it is clear that reaction rate in both fenton and ozonation processes strongly depends on h2o2 concentration thus there is existence of optimal concentration of h2o2 for maximum degradation rate of ofl thus effect of h2o2 dosage on the degradation of ofl was studied with varying h2o2 dosage from 50 to 250 mg l at ph of 9 initial concentration of ofl of 100 mg l with 1 5 g l of mfs 5 dosage the result is illustrated in fig 6 what stands out from data in fig 6 is that there was existence of optimal dosage of h2o2 in both perozone and ozone fenton which gave maximum degradation efficiency of ofl the degradation of ofl reached a peak of 52 17 and 69 09 respectively for perozone and ozone fenton at h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l a low h2o2 concentration of 50 mg l gave a low degradation of ofl reaching 27 04 and 38 17 respectively for perozone and ozone fenton however when increasing further h2o2 concentration over 100 mg l the ofl mineralization saw a considerable downward trend the ofl mineralization efficiency decreased corresponding with an increase in h2o2 concentration specifically the ofl mineralization efficiency was 29 51 23 10 and 16 69 for perozone and 39 07 31 25 and 26 88 for ozone fenton corresponding with h2o2 concentration of 150 200 and 250 mg l in fact in the ozone fenton system the reaction between iron ions and h2o2 enhanced formation of oh according to eq 11 33 11 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 oh h such oh formed has the potential to destroy the ofl however a too high ratio of h2o2 fe2 fe3 had insignificant improvement in the ofl degradation due to the scavenging effect of peroxide on the oh as described in eqs 12 and 13 54 12 oh h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 13 oh ho 2 oh ho 2 moreover degradation of ofl was decreased because of dissociation of h2o2 in aqueous solution into ho2 which has weak attack in the aromatic ring structure of ofl 33 and the recombination of oh eq 14 also decreased the ofl removal efficiency 29 14 2 oh h 2 o 2 in contrast an insufficient amount of h2o2 to react with iron ions o3 and oh also led to a decrease in oxidation ability of perozone and ozone fenton 33 thus in this study it is clear that the adding h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l in to perozone and ozone fenton reactions enhanced degradation of ofl because the h2o2 reacted with both o3 and feo and fe3o4 presence in constituent of mfs 5 catalyst as described in following equations 21 15 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 16 o 3 ho 2 oh o 2 o 2 17 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 18 o 3 h ho 3 19 ho 3 oh o 2 from discussion as abovementioned the h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l was chosen as the most suitable value for oxidation of ofl by ozonation systems in this study 3 6 effect of initial ofloxacin concentration the effect of initial ofl concentration on mineralization of ofl by ozonation only perozone and ozone fenton was investigated in practical initial pollutant concentration is an important operational parameter which determined cost as well as feasibility of treatment technology in this study investigating influence of initial ofl concentration on mineralization of ofl by ozonation systems was carried out with varying initial ofl concentrations between 50 and 250 mg l at ph of 9 h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l during 100 min of contact time the effect of initial ofl concentration on the mineralization of ofl is shown in fig 7 fig 7 indicated that the mineralization efficiency of ofl decreased with increasing initial ofl concentration from 50 to 250 mg l for all ozonation systems the ofl mineralization efficiency by the ozone fenton system was higher than those of other systems at all applied ofl concentrations the ofl mineralization efficiency maximized at 100 mg l of initial ofl concentration specifically removal of cod reached 30 c co 0 7 55 c co 0 45 and 70 c co 0 3 respectively for o3 alone perozone and o3 fenton the results were because at a high initial concentration of ofl corresponded with a growth in number of ofl molecules while h2o2 and mfs 5 dosages were constant consequently the formed oh radical amount is constant as a result degradation of ofl was reduced 10 besides there was a significant different between ofl removal efficiency at initial ofl concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l this is due to at very low concentration of ofl the dosage of h2o2 is too high to react with ofl leading to consumption of oh by this excess h2o2 besides at a too high initial concentration of ofl caused saturating of catalyst s surface by overlapping of ofl molecules moreover intermediate products were generated during degradation reactions of ofl by ozonation also competed adsorption sites on the catalyst s surface causing inhibition of degradation rate of ofl by these reactions 10 54 the similar results were reported by scholars for instance mineralization of rhb by fenton like oxidation using magnetic iron containing waste slag composite catalyst reached a peak at 100 mg l of rhb with removal efficiency of 83 33 39 removal of cod in the distillery industrial effluent by the o3 uv fe2 h2o2 decreased from 100 to 75 and from 100 to 63 with rising cod from 1500 to 6000 mg l and optimal cod concentration for o3 uv fe2 h2o2 reaction was 3000 mg l with a removal efficiency of 95 5 10 mineralization of rr24 by ozonation and fenton was also found decreased when initial rr24 concentration increased 55 3 7 effect of catalyst dosage the supplementation of catalyst into ozonation reactions affected chemisorption of the ofl on the catalyst s surface and was a first important step for the catalytic reaction because adsorbed ofl particles were then mineralized by o3 or oh therefore effect of catalyst dosage on the mineralization of ofl by ozone fenton was studied with fixing solution ph of 9 h2o2 of 100 mg l initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l and varying mfs 5 catalyst dosages from 0 5 to 2 5 g l over 100 min of reaction time time course of mineralization of ofl at various mfs 5 dosages is showed in fig 8 fig 8 indicated that the mineralization efficiency of ofl witnessed an upward trend when catalyst dosage increased from 0 5 to 1 5 g l the degradation of ofl maximized at mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l with 69 76 of ofl removal efficiency the result was because a growth in mfs 5 dosage enhanced rate of ozone decomposition and interaction between h2o2 with iron ions in constituent of mfs 5 and thus the generation of more oh radicals such formed oh radicals were accelerated thanks to the feo and fe3o4 on the mfs 5 surfcace during catalytic ozone fenton reaction of ofl besides the growth in mfs 5 dosage increased the number of adsorption and reactive sites between h2o2 and mfs 5 which corresponded with the rise in production of oh radicals as a result the mineralization efficiency of ofl was enhanced basiri and rafiee 2016 56 reported the ozonation rate of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol increased when growing dosage of zno nanocatalyst however when the mfs 5 dosage was further increased degradation of ofl fell at too high catalyst dosage may result in negative effect on mineralization efficiency of ofl due to the excess catalyst causing a reduction in surface area available for adsorption of ofl molecules and scavenging oh which led to a decrease in catalytic activity of mfs 5 another reason was because h2o2 dosage was fixed while mfs 5 dosage was increased in ozone fenton reaction thus amount of h2o2 was insufficient to continue reacting with excess mfs 5 particles to form more oh besides when mfs 5 dosage was high both oxidizing agents oh or feo 2 were discarded by iron ions in constituent of mfs 5 through the parasitic reactions eqs 20 and 21 respectively leading to limitation of the formation of oh radical 29 20 oh fe 2 fe 3 oh 21 feo 2 fe 2 2h 2fe 3 h 2 o the analogue result was found by mansouri et al 2015 33 when using o3 fe2 h2o2 system for degradation of endocrine disrupting compound the study showed that a further increase in fe2 concentration 0 5 10 2 mol l led to a decrease in the dep removal rate because the excess of fe ii ions will consume the radicals leading to the decrease in process efficiency 3 8 utilization efficiency of o3 and h2o2 decomposition the utilization efficiency of o3 and h2o2 were studied at the optimal reaction conditions of ofl removal process by o3 fenton system and the obtained results are indicated in fig a2 as can be seen in fig a2a the h2o2 concentration can be decreased to 10 9 mg l with a utilization efficiency of h2o2 calculated of 89 2 besides the average flow rates of o3 in effluent and exhaust gases concentration which were discharged from the reactor during oxidation process of ofl were about 0 008 0 001 mg min and 0 469 0 02 mg l respectively and the efficiency of ozone utilization reached 95 69 fig a2b the results suggested that the pore structure and large surface area of the modified catalyst provided sufficient reaction sites and supported active metal oxides for the catalysis of further o3 fenton system for the generation of more hydroxyl radicals thus resulting in nearly complete ozone and h2o2 consumption this result is consistent with those of ahmadi et al 2017 59 and xu et al 2020 14 the enhanced efficiency of decomposition of o3 and h2o2 during heterogeneous catalytic ozonation in presence of fenton agent could be attributed to the supported fe and si metal oxides and their activation in addition the efficiency of ozone transfer between liquid gaseous phases was improved and the reaction equilibrium shifted towards ozone depletion under the role of the catalyst 3 9 kinetic and mechanism studies with assuming that the oh radical concentration reaches steady state during the ozonation process of ofl the mineralization of ofl is considered following an apparent first order reaction and reaction rate of ozonation is proportional to cod removal therefore the ozonation reaction kinetic can be described by the following equations 22 ln c c o k d t where co and c indicate concentration of ofl at the initial time of reaction and at t min of reaction respectively by plotting ln c co versus reaction time the experimental data were fitted as a straight line and kd apparent first order rate constant was determined as the slope of the line the kinetic data of mineralization of ofl by all ozone only perozone and ozone fenton at various solution ph initial ofl concentration h2o2 dosages scavengers and mfs 5 dosages are illustrated in fig a3 the data in fig a3 showed that there was a high linearity of the plots which confirmed degradation process of ofl followed pseudo first order kinetic model with the high correlation coefficient values r2 between 0 91 and 0 99 as desired the calculated kd values had well agreement with removal efficiencies of ofl at all studied conditions to be specific the obtained kd values of o3 fenton o3 h2o2 o3 at all operational conditions for effect of solution ph on the degradation of ofl the kd reached a peak at ph of 9 the maximum kd were 0 0043 0 0101 and 0 0187 min for o3 o3 h2o2 and o3 fenton respectively fig a3a besides the pseudo first order model described accurately the mineralization kinetic of ofl with high values of r2 0 93 for all ozonation systems in terms of the effect of initial ofl concentration the kd values saw a downward trend corresponded with an increase in initial ofl concentration and followed the same order of mineralization efficiency of ofl the mineralization efficiency of o3 fenton system was higher that those of both o3 and perozone at all applied initial ofl concentrations fig a3b towards effect of h2o2 dosage on the mineralization of ofl the maximum kd values respectively were 0 0088 and 0 0135 min for perozone and ozone fenton at 100 mg l of h2o2 a too low or too high of h2o2 dosage was supplemented into ozonation reaction led to a low kd similarly the high r2 values were also achieved in this experiment which further confirmed the ofl mineralization by ozonation systems followed the pseudo first order fig a3c in term of effect of mfs 5 dosage on the pseudo first order rate constant the kd reached higher values when the dosage of mfs 5 catalyst was risen from 0 5 g l to 1 5 g l for o3 fenton system and the mineralization efficiency of ofl reached a peak of 0 0139 min at mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l however there were a downward trend in kd values with a further increase in mfs 5 dosage over 1 5 g l fig a3e in this study it is clear that supplementation of fenton reagent h2o2 mfs 5 into ozonation system strongly enhanced mineralization rate of ofl under all experimental conditions the supposed main mechanisms for promotion of ofl degradation by integrated o3 fenton system included 1 direct by ozone self decomposition and 2 indirect through oh radicals formed from decomposition of o3 and h2o2 by metallic sites on the mfs 5 catalyst surface 11 however experiment to investigate effect of solution ph on the degradation of ofl by o3 fenton showed a high mineralization efficiency of ofl occurred in alkaline medium with ph of 9 thus ozonation process of ofl through formed oh radicals during in this o3 fenton reaction can be main mechanism degradation of persistent organic pollutants by aops namely by heterogeneous fenton and ozonation is attributed through hydroxyl radicals oh which are continuously formed in fenton oxidation and ozonation of pops therefore in this study to confirm contribution of oh in mineralization of ofl a series of scavengers including t butanol cl and hco3 were supplemented into perozone and ozone fenton reactions the experiments were performed at optimal conditions of solution ph h2o2 dosage initial ofl concentration and mfs 5 dosage which were found in the above experiments to be specific the experiment to study effect of scavengers on the mineralization of ofl was conducted with fixing solution ph of 9 0 h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l at 1 5 g l of mfs 5 with adding 100 mg l of t butanol 100 mg l of cl and 100 mg l of hco3 in separate into perozone and o3 fenton reactions the mineralization efficiency of ofl by above systems is presented in fig 9 the obtained kd and r2 values by these systems are indicated in fig a3d tert butanol is considered a well known scavenger of oh radical because of its very rapid reaction rate with oh 29 besides cl and hco3 also are inorganic ions existed popular in water and wastewater which seriously inhibit reaction rate by scavenging oh radicals thus 100 mg l of t butanol cl and hco3 was added into perozone and ozone fenton to further ascertain mineralization mechanism of ofl through oh radical formed during reaction process what stands out from data in fig 9 is that the ofl degradation rate was seriously slowed down in presence of t butanol cl and hco3 on the contrary in reaction without scavengers the ofl degradation occurred with the highest rate of 0 0099 and 0 0139 min respectively for perozone and ozone fenton and supplementation of mfs 5 catalyst into perozone enhanced degradation reaction rate of ofl by 1 5 times as can be shown in fig 9 the reaction with adding t butanol led to a strongest inhibition of ofl degradation there was no nearly degradation of ofl in this reaction the inhibition effect of ofl degradation was followed in reaction with adding cl with kd of 0 0033 and 0 0073 min respectively for perozone and ozone fenton the inhibition effect of ofl degradation was the lowest in reaction with supplementation of hco3 the results confirmed that oh radical is the main factor to control the mechanism of perozone and ozone fenton of ofl degradation the results also showed that mfs 5 could play an important role as catalyst for the o3 fenton system by continuously production of oh causing promotion of ofl degradation by these formed oh radicals as can be seen from the data in fig 9 all t butanol cl and hco3 were scavengers to decompose the oh leading to the remarkable decrease in the mineralization of ofl by both perozone and ozone fenton these results agreed with degradation of tpa using o3 h2o2 fe2 uv 29 with adding tert butanol leading to strong decrease in tpa mineralization besides data about physical chemical properties of mfs 5 catalyst further confirmed degradation enhancement mechanism of ofl by integrated o3 fenton in the o3 fenton reaction iron ions and h2o2 greatly promoted the ozone decomposition leading to the generation of more hydroxyl radicals which enhanced mineralization rate of ofl the degradation mechanism of ofl by o3 fenton was very complex which was combination of direct ozone attack reactions adsorption by catalyst and indirect mechanism through free oh radical occurring both in water phase and on the mfs 5 surface specifically the presence of feo fe3o4 and sio2 in the constituent of mfs 5 catalyst xrd graph in fig 3b which played role both as an adsorbent and catalyst in the o3 fenton during o3 fenton of ofl both o3 and h2o2 were adsorbed on the mfs 5 s surface then mfs 5 would act as a heterogeneous catalyst to produce active sites on its surface the constituents of feo fe3o4 and sio2 presence in mfs 5 promoted ozone decomposition and both feo fe3o4 reacted with h2o2 in aqueous solution to form more oh radicals in system finally both mfs 5 and formed oh took part ozone fenton reaction for mineralization of ofl besides due to transfer of electron several iron elements in feo fe3o4 constituent were changed into fe2 and fe3 ions these iron ions were then combined with ozone to increase degradation rate of o3 leading to effectively improvement the utilization rate of o3 to 95 69 which caused generation of more hydroxyl radicals for degradation of ofl 55 moreover a part of si element in sio2 can be transferred into si4 which also participated in decomposition of o3 to form oh 55 the reactions for production of oh are similar to diffusion controlled reaction and are caused by the three step mechanism as follows 1 abstracting h atom 2 adding oh to cc ring and 3 interaction between oh with n atom in constituent of ofl 9 from above discussion it is clear that the feo fe3o4 and sio2 on the mfs 5 surface played an important role in enhancement of ofl degradation rate by o3 fenton thanks to mfs 5 s adsorption ability towards h2o2 o3 and pollutants on the its surface leading to accelerate decomposing o3 to react with h2o2 available in solution to form more oh the oh radicals then continued to attack aromatic ring structure of contaminants and transform them into intermediate products co2 and h2o 38 in this study the ofl was mineralized mainly through oh radical formed during ozone fenton through mechanisms as above discussed the main reactions related to oxidation mechanism of o3 fenton process are indicated in eqs 23 31 23 fe 2 o 3 fe 3 o 3 24 o 3 h o 2 oh 25 fe 2 o 3 feo 2 o 2 26 feo 2 h 2 o fe 3 oh oh 27 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 28 o 3 ho 2 oh o 2 o 2 29 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 30 o 3 h ho 3 31 ho 3 oh o 2 furthermore from eds analysis as shown in fig 2 the proportion of fe si elements in constituent of fs after modification by mixture of fe3 fe2 was increased by two times which proved for improvement of catalytic activity of mfs 5 in degradation of ofl by enriched metals on the catalyst s surface besides the ftir data fig 3a also showed there was appearance of oh groups on the mfs 5 s surface moreover the surface of metal oxides including feo fe3o4 and sio2 in aqueous solution is easy to be hydroxylated by the dissociative chemisorption of water molecules these hydroxyl groups would release proton and act as the brönsted acid sites however the adsorbed water molecules could then be desorbed along with the formation of metal cations and coordinately unsaturated oxygen which can act as the lewis acids and lewis bases respectively surface hydroxyl groups and these sites are responsible for catalytic ozonation reactions of ofl from aqueous solution 48 besides thanks to presence of h2o2 in fenton agent o3 was decomposed to form o3 initiating for a reaction chain to form hydroperoxide anion ho2 32 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 33 ho 2 o 3 o 3 ho 2 the next reactions to form oh in presence of magnetic catalyst mfs 5 for mineralization of ofl by o3 fenton system can be described as following equations 34 mfs 5 o 3 h mfs 5 ho 3 35 mfs 5 ho 3 oh o 2 36 mfs 5 ho 2 mfs 5 o 2 h 37 mfs 5 o 2 o 3 mfs 5 o 3 o 2 38 mfs 5 o 3 h mfs 5 ho 3 39 mfs 5 ho 3 oh o 2 totally thanks to presence of h2o2 in fenton agent which was added into ozonation system two oh formed one h2o2 decomposed eqs 35 and 39 from abovementioned results and discussion it is clear that integration between o3 and fenton agent using magnetic composite heterogeneous catalyst produced more active radicals which consisted of oh o2 leading to completely mineralization of ofl as described by following general equation eq 40 40 active oxidizing radicals ofl intermediates co 2 h 2 o in summary the adding h2o2 mfs 5 fenton reagent into the ozonation reaction strongly enhanced degradation of ofl antibiotic through synergetic effect of o3 h2o2 mfs 5 in same system by increasing amount of formed oh radicals the feo fe3o4 and sio2 constituents on the mfs 5 surface attributed to be main factor which adsorbed o3 h2o2 and ofl on the its surface as well as promoted decomposition of o3 to react with h2o2 with aim to form more oh radicals to degrade effectively ofl from wastewater the mechanism of integrated o3 fenton process for mineralization of ofl could be illustrated in fig 10 3 10 mineralization and degradation pathway of ofl the experiment for investigation of mineralization efficiency of ofl by o3 fenton was conducted under optimal conditions of ph of 9 mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l initial ofl of 100 mg l and h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l over 100 min of reaction time what stands out from fig a4 is that after 100 min of reaction time 96 7 ofl was degraded and 62 toc removal was obtained by using o3 fenton system the toc reduction was slower than ofl reduction under the same conditions there was a difference in toc removal efficiency and ofl degradation was because the decomposition of ofl molecules formed intermediates products these intermediate products requested longer time to completely mineralize into co2 and h2o by study of degradation routes of ofl in the previous studies this study recommended the ofl degradation pathway by o3 fenton as shown in the fig 11 13 14 40 57 58 thanks to oxidation of o3 and unselective attacked of oh various intermediate products were formed during mineralization of ofl by o3 fenton in pathway a in the first step the cc double bonds were broken down during catalytic ozonation which was continuously followed by the benzene ring opening reaction 14 three o2 atoms were added to the double bonds in which two of them were linked together dp1 the remaining o2 atom combined with hydrogen to produce oh groups and cc bonds dp2 besides the formed intermediate products continue to react with hydroxyl radicals to form multiple biodegradable products dp3 dp4 in pathway b fluoride in ofl was removed to form dp5 40 57 then the oh radicals produced during o3 fenton process attacked into piperazinyl substituent oxazinyl substituent and carboxyl group in the ofl structure the directly cleavage of the piperazinyl substituent of ofl by oh formed dp6 dp7 dp8 and dp9 besides the carboxyl group was also removed by oh to produce co2 resulting in the transformation of dp10 moreover the hydroxyl radicals attacked the oxazinyl substituent to form dp12 clearly both ring of piperazinyl substituent oxazinyl substituent were attacked by hydroxyl radicals in the o3 fenton leading to production of small molecular weight carboxylic acids and inorganic molecules such co2 and h2o 3 11 treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by o3 fenton the experiment for investigating treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by o3 fenton was performed at optimal conditions which obtained from lab scale experiment characteristics of real pharmaceutical wastewater are presented in table 3 from data in table 3 it is clear that the pharmaceutical wastewater belongs to low biodegradability with very low of bod5 cod ratio of 0 15 therefore the wastewater needs to pre treat to improve bod5 cod ratio facilitating for following biological treatment in this study the integrated o3 fenton system was applied to removal of persistent organic compounds from this wastewater and the results are showed in fig 12 as is illustrated by fig 11 71 cod removal and 62 toc removal were achieved by using o3 fenton system after 100 min reaction the results is because of the fact that by modification of fs using mixture of magnetic composite the pore volume and specific surface area of catalyst was well developed which caused more ofl molecules adsorbed on the catalyst s surface consequently enhancement of decomposition of both o3 and h2o2 to form more oxidative radicals which participated in organics mineralization and subsequently a decrease in cod and toc values during the treatment process 14 18 the results suggested that the raw wastewater pre treated by o3 fenton system accelerated remarkably the degradation of persistent organic compounds into several intermediate metabolites and the biodegradability enhancement of non biodegradable compounds through the o3 fenton process as a result treatment of wastewater by the o3 fenton system can provide favorable conditions for biological treatment 3 12 stability and reusability of catalyst the stability and reusability of mfs 5 play a vital role in its application for treatment of wastewater therefore the used catalyst was separated using an external magnetic field and dried to continue apply for next experiments with aim to evaluate its stability and reusability in this study the experiments were conducted at optimal conditions of ph h2o2 dosage initial ofl concentration and catalyst dosage which found out in abovementioned experiments using o3 fenton reaction the obtained results are presented in fig 13 fig 12a showed that there was negligible change in the mineralization of ofl through five consecutive runs the mineralization efficiency of ofl saw a slight fall from 72 09 to 66 91 after five successive cycles suggesting there has no destroy of mfs 5 during the ozonation process and retained good stability the slight decrease in catalytic efficiency of ozone fenton systems might be due to loss of catalyst in the reuse experiments stability of catalyst was assessed by study on leaching of fe into the reaction solution the results are indicated in fig 12b the concentrations of fe ions were investigated at the optimal reaction conditions the fe2 and fe3 concentrations leached into solution respectively were 0 9 and 2 8 mg l at 100 min reaction it is significantly less than the leaching 18 8 mg l by using fe3o4 ceo2 composite as catalyst 60 leaching iron of 5 mg l in fenton degradation of organic dyes by fe2ges4 61 or 9 8 mg l of leached iron found in heterogeneous fenton with fe3o4 magnetite nanoparticles after 180 reaction min 62 with the low leaching iron ratio proved that applied catalyst in this study was feasible in practical application 4 conclusions combination of various aops commonly causes interesting synergistic effects that can considerably reduce the reaction time and economic cost in this study an iron containing waste natural mineral was successfully modified with magnetic composite of fe3 fe2 and applied as heterogeneous catalyst in fenton process integrated with ozone for degradation of ofl from wastewater this combination explored the synergistic effects between o3 and fenton agent for the mineralization of ofl antibiotic in integrated ozone fenton system with a enhancement factor r of 1 58 and high catalytic potential of 51 2 the comparative study of the ofl removal efficiency of ozone based systems including ozone only perozone and integrated ozone fenton indicated when the fenton reagent was added into ozonation reaction degradation of ofl was strongly enhanced among above studied ozone based systems the mineralization of ofl reached the highest in the o3 fenton system under optimal operational conditions of ph of 9 h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l and mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l at these operational conditions the mineralization of ofl evaluated through cod removal obtained 70 analysis data of catalyst s properties illustrated that the mfs 5 was an effective catalyst for ozone fenton system due to presence of high amount of feo fe3o4 and sio2 in the catalyst s constituent study on reaction mechanisms showed that degradation of ofl through two main routes 1 direct ozone self decomposition and 2 indirect ozonation through oh radicals among them degradation of ofl through a huge amount of oh radicals formed from adsorption of h2o2 o3 and ofl by feo fe3o4 and sio2 constituents on the catalyst s surface to accelerate o3 decomposition to react with h2o2 was main mechanism besides the role of oh in degradation of ofl was also further confirmed by conducting the experiments with adding scavengers including tert butanol cl and hco3 as desired the results showed that degradation rates of ofl in the systems with adding scavengers were seriously retarded due to oh scavenging effect by these agents the degradation of ofl followed pseudo first order kinetic model with high values of r2 there was good correlation between calculated kd values with mineralization efficiencies of ofl at various operational conditions of ozonation systems as a result the utilization a modified waste natural mineral as catalyst in integrated ozone fenton system considerably enhanced degradation of ofl antibiotic from wastewater furthermore the mfs 5 catalyst exhibited a high stability with a low leached amount of fe and high reusability through five cycles with a negligible decrease in ofl removal efficiency besides study on treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by integrated ozone fenton system gave high removal efficiencies of both cod and toc suggesting that the o3 fenton was the fully promising and feasible technology in practical application for persistent organic compounds containing wastewater treatment main limitation of this study was not applied the o3 fenton system on the treatment of various real low biodegradable wastewater at large scale therefore the o3 fenton system should be continued

12844,in this study a heterogeneous catalyst derived from iron containing waste mineral was enriched by magnetic composite fe3 fe2 at modification ratio of 5 for the highest mineralization of ofloxacin ofl by ozone fenton system a comparative study between o3 perozone h2o2 and o3 fenton systems in mineralization of ofloxacin ofl under various solution ph h2o2 dosages initial ofl concentrations and catalyst mfs 5 dosages was performed adding fenton reagent h2o2 mfs 5 into ozonation system gave the highest ofl removal efficiency of 70 at optimal operational conditions of ph 9 catalyst dosage of 1 5 g l h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l with initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l due to synergistic effect of o3 and fenton reagent the catalyst s properties were evaluated through bet sem image eds and mapping data ftir and xrd the main mineralization mechanism of ofl was through hydroxyl radicals oh which were formed during ozonation process because feo fe3o4 and sio2 in the mfs 5 s constituent accelerated decomposition of o3 and promoted reaction rate with h2o2 the catalyst exhibited a good reusability and stability after five consecutive runs with negligible change in mineralization efficiency of ofl and a very low leached iron amount into solution besides there was an efficient improvement of biodegradability of real pharmaceutical wastewater after treatment by o3 fenton with 71 and 62 removal of cod and toc respectively these findings indicated utilizing magnetic modified waste iron mineral as heterogeneous catalyst in combination with h2o2 and o3 achieved high efficiency and feasibility in removal of ofl antibiotic from real pharmaceutical wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ofloxacin ozonation ozone fenton modified heterogeneous catalyst synergetic effect 1 introduction antibiotics pollution in the water bodies has become a major concern worldwide 1 among antibiotics fluoroquinolones are wide spectrum anti bacterial which have attracted much attention in recent years due to an increasing apply in hospitals households and veterinary applications they are the third largest group of antibiotics making up 17 of the global market share 2 these pharmaceuticals residues are discharged into receiving sources through many routes consisting of disposal of human and other organisms urine and feces wastewater from hospital and pharmaceutical production and effluent of wastewater treatment plants which have risen concerns related with antibiotic occurrence in water resources the residual antibiotics are persistent and low biodegradable with their half life times of 10 6 days in surface water 3 and up to 580 days in soil matrices 4 ofloxacin ofl is an important fluoroquinolone antibiotics which is widely used in treatment of infectious diseases 5 however there is only about 30 of ofl absorbed and metabolized by human and other organisms body the 70 left amount of ofl has been discharged into receiving water bodies including surface drinking water and wastewater enhancing generation of antibiotic resistance microbial populations 2 it is reported that the ofl was found in surface water at concentrations of 31 7 μg l 5 the existence of the ofl in water environment is proved to be harmful for human health and ecosystem even at very low concentration it has become evident that most popularly applied ofl and other fluoroquinolone antibiotics are toxic carcinogenic and genotoxic for organisms 6 because of abovementioned concerns advanced treatment technologies are required for removal of the ofl from water medium and wastewater the biological method is effective eco friendly and low cost for treatment of highly polluted industrial wastewaters 5 7 however the biological technology applying various microorganisms for treatment of persistent organic pollutants pops containing wastewater possesses several drawbacks such as low efficiency requirement of long sludge retention time and easy in loading shock due to high toxicity of pops for microbial 5 7 8 recently advanced oxidation processes aops have been popularly used and favored in pre treatment of pops from wastewater to improve bod5 cod ratio to facilitate for following biological treatment 7 besides the aops are suitable to remove residues in effluent of secondary treatment in wastewater treatment plants the reason the aops favored in removal of pops are due to continuously generation of oxidizing agents like hydroxyl radicals oh which can unselectively attack aromatic rings of organic matters and mineralize them to non toxic end products of co2 and h2o 7 9 10 among the aops ozone based systems and fenton reaction have been applied the most commonly 7 10 ozone based treatment methods have recently received considerably attention because of their effectiveness and oxidation potential in degradation of antibiotic residues from wastewaters 11 12 for example tay and madehi 2015 13 reported ozonation of ofloxacin catazone of ofl using mnox ceox γ al2o3 as a catalyst 14 chen and wang 2020 15 studied on degradation of ofloxacin by o3 and perozone o3 h2o2 tokumura et al 2016 16 investigated removal of carbamazepine and diclofenac by perozone o3 h2o2 treatment of ciprofloxacin using o3 titanium dioxide montmorillonite tio2 mmt nanocomposite 12 electro peroxone for degradation of levofloxacin 1 and amoxicillin 17 decontamination of sulfamethoxazole 18 and amoxicillin 19 by nanocomposite oxidation of organic compounds through ozonation is attributed directly by ozone or and by oh or the combination of both direct ozone oxidation is favored under acidic conditions whereas higher ph values lead to the generation of oxidant species such as oh positively affecting the efficiency of the treatment 11 besides fenton oxidation is also an effective method in antibiotic degradation 20 the fenton reactions are divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton in the fenton reaction the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts decomposed h2o2 to o2 and h2o to form a huge amount of oh radicals 21 in recently the fenton reactions have been successful in degradation of various antibiotics such as fenton oxidation of ofloxacin using montmorillonite fe3o4 composite 22 heterogeneous photo fenton catalyzed by biogenic femn oxides for removal of ofl 23 degradation of ofloxacin amoxicillin and tetracycline by heterogeneous catalytic fenton mnfe2o4 c nh2 24 removal of ofl by heterogeneous catalytic fenton cdta modified alginate 25 heterogeneous fenton like degradation of ofloxacin 26 photo fenton in removal of carbamazepine and diclofenac 16 amoxicillin 27 although both ozonation and fenton oxidation processes are very effective and popular in the removal of antibiotics but both processes possesses several disadvantages which have limited their application in mineralization of persistent organic compounds the drawbacks consisted of generation of undesirable iron sludge loss of the catalyst in the effluent need for ph adjustment before and after reaction homogeneous fenton process 28 high cost and difficult in separation of catalyst after reaction heterogeneous fenton process 28 and electricity and low effectiveness in degradation of pollutants even incompletely mineralization of pops ozonation 11 for these reasons it is desirable to combine two or more aops simultaneously in order to increase the oxidation rate and shorten reaction time by enhancing the production of more oh radicals leading to higher efficiencies than using the single processes thus to improve the oxidizing power of ozone a combination of ozonation with several other aops has been developed and these methods have already found a wide spread application in the treatment of wastewater 29 among integrated aops the combination of ozonation with homogeneous fenton process was proved to reach a peak in removal of organic pollutants with a minimal operational cost compared with other processes under the same operational conditions for instance beltral heredia et al 2001 30 conducted a comparative study about removal efficiency of several oxidation processes in degradation of p hydroxybenzoic acid the authors reported the highest mineralization efficiency was obtained by o3 h2o2 fe2 wu and ng 2008 31 used ozone based systems for decolorization of c i reactive red 2 rr2 and found that the combinations of h2o2 fe3 with o3 gave a higher decolorization rate than that of o3 and consumed 62 energy compared with o3 system removal of terephthalic acid containing wastewater by a combination process of o3 h2o2 fe2 uv showed the highest oxidizing efficiency of 90 of cod at 240 min which was higher than those of other aops 29 the ozone fenton for stabilizing leachate was investigated by amr and azir 2012 32 in 2013 zeng et al 21 studied on degradation of phenol by o3 fenton and reported that phenol degradation rate in o3 fenton was 20 higher than that in o3 process at ph of 6 8 degradation of endocrine disrupting compound diethyl phthalate dep by o3 fenton reagents was investigated by mansouri et al 2015 33 the results indicated the synergetic effect of o3 and fenton reagent was because ozone accelerated fenton reagents to form more oh leading to enhancement of dep degradation the integration of o3 photo fenton for treating industrial effluent reached 100 of decolor and 95 5 of cod removal was studied by asaithambi et al 2016 10 most recently sanchis et all 2018 7 reported the o3 solar photo fenton for treatment of industrial effluent with removal efficiencies of cod and toc respectively reached 67 and 62 clearly there have been studies on combination between o3 and homogeneous fenton in degradation of various pops with a higher removal efficiency than those of alone aops however to the best of our knowledge there has no studies on the integration of o3 with heterogeneous catalytic fenton in treatment of ofloxacin from wastewater until now this can be due to high cost and difficult in recovery of used heterogeneous catalysts therefore the searching a low cost catalyst towards utilization a solid waste to fabricate a heterogeneous catalyst for aops has important significant the utilization several argriculture by products to fabricate biochar from herbaceous biomass in combination with nanomaterials 34 or bre brewer s spent grain waste for production of activated carbon and carbon nanotubes 35 as heterogeneous catalyst for aops have been studied on the circular economy by converting low value lignocellulosic materials into added value products 36 37 in vietnam there are a huge amount of mineral mines corresponding with a discharge of large amount of metal slags among these waste metal slags the iron slag was utilized as catalyst and composite catalyst in fenton oxidation of dyes in our previous works with high removal efficiency of pollutants 38 39 thus in the present study a heterogeneous catalyst derived from iron containing natural mineral enriched by magnetic composite was developed this catalyst provided an interesting solution permitting easy fast and low cost separation by application of an external magnetic field feasibility in its recovery and reusability specially the integrated o3 heterogeneous catalytic fenton like process is expected to generate synergistic effects to rise the process efficiency by direct ozonation and generation of more hydroxyl radicals favored at basic ph and or decomposition of o3 to oh in presence of magnetic modified waste iron slag mfs the aim of this study therefore was to modify the waste iron slag by magnetic composite in order to use as heterogeneous catalyst for fenton process in combination with ozone formed from oxygen in atmosphere to mineralize the ofloxacin from wastewater a comparative investigation of the performance of three systems including ozonation o3 perozone o3 h2o2 and integrated o3 fenton like o3 h2o2 mfs in the mineralization of ofl was performed characteristics of magnetic enriched waste iron slag catalyst were fully determined besides effect of operational parameters on removal efficiency of ofl by ozonation processes was investigated especially kinetic and mechanism of the ofl mineralization by ozonation systems were systematically studied the feasibility in

ofl in 1000 ml of double distilled water the ofl solutions at desired concentrations were achieved by diluting the stock ofl using ddw the real pharmaceutical wastewater was collected from collection tank in wastewater treatment plant of saigon pharmaceutical company sapharco in ho chi minh city vietnam the hydrogen peroxide 30 w w was provided by katayama chemical co japan and used as an oxidizing agent in ozonation reactions the naoh and h2so4 1 m for adjusting solution ph and fecl3 and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o for modification of raw iron slag were purchased from taanjin china the o3

bubbled through the ofl wastewater in the reactor through an air bubble stone diffuser placed at bottom of ozone reactor the gas flow rate and concentration of ozone were controlled at 0 276 g min and 0 091 g l respectively the waste iron slag fs was collected from ferrous and non ferrous metallurgy processes at thai nguyen province vietnam 2 2 preparation of catalysts after collected from thai nguyen non ferrous metals limited company the fs was dried at 105 c for 48 h the dried fs was then blend and sieved to achieve particles with size 0 25 mm the obtained fs was continuously used for modification by magnetic mixture of fe3 fe2 at certain ratios in modification procedure of the fs by mixture of fe3 fe2 the mixture of fe3 fe2 was firstly formed using fecl3 and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o at a fe3 fe2 ratio of 2 1 the modified iron slag mfs was generated by mixing fs with mixture of fe3 fe2 at modification ratios of 5 10 15 and 20 w w of mixture of fe3 fe2 fs to obtain 10 0 g of mfs at various modification ratios the mixing ratios between fs fecl3 and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o are presented in table 1 the detail description of the modification procedure was as follows at the begining of the process the mixture of fecl3 and nh4 2fe so4 2 6h2o with weight ratios as shown in the table 1 was dissolved into a beaker of 20 ml ddw a certain amount of fs as indicated in table 1 was then added in this mixture with completely stirring the mixture was filled with ddw to 50 ml and adjusted ph until 11 using naoh 1 m the mixture was then shaken at 120 rpm for 6 8 h subsequently the mixture was filtered to obtain solid catalyst the solid catalyst was then dried at 105 c for 4 h following that the dried solid catalyst was blend to form fine particles finally the modified waste iron slag catalysts were stored in sealed plastic containers and labeled as mfs 5 mfs 10 mfs 15 mfs 20 in order to use for further experiments 2 3 experiments design in this study the ozonation experiments of ofloxacin were conducted in the semi batch mode the general schematic diagram for setting up the experiments of the ofl mineralization by ozonation systems is illustrated in fig a1 all experiments were conducted in a 1 2 l tubular borosilicate glass ozone reactor with a height of 450 mm and inner diameter of 60 mm the ozonation reactor was installed with gas input and output and sampling equipment the ozone reactor contained 500 ml of ofl solution at certain concentration was simultaneously supplemented with catalyst at different conditions of solution ph and catalyst dosage under fluidized state ozone gas was generated from atmospheric oxygen using a ozone generator ozone fresh ozima sp f1 g 4 sinh phu technology development joint stock company vietnam at a fixed flow rate and concentration of ozone of 0 276 g min and 0 091 g l respectively the aqueous ozone concentration into the reactor was adjusted by changing the flow rate of the feed air the reactor contained 500 ml of ofl solution and catalyst dosages varying from 0 5 to 2 5 g l the solution in the reactor was completely stirred using an air bubble stone placed in the bottom of the reactor the sample was taken out at regular time interval of each 20 min in whole 100 min of reaction time in the perozone o3 h2o2 and integrated ozone fenton like o3 h2o2 mfs various dosages of h2o2 ranged from 50 mg l to 250 mg l was added in the reactor the solution ph was changed between 3 5 7 9 and 11 the o3 escaped from top of the reactor was captured in conical flask containing 2000 ml of 2 ki solution to destruct the excess ozone 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 the characteristics of catalyst the properties of raw and modified catalysts at optimal modification ratio were assessed through bet sem images eds and mapping data ftir and xrd spectrum the textural characteristics of fs and mfs at optimal composite ratio were analyzed using n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k quantachrome instruments version 11 0 nova the surface morphologies of catalysts were observed using electron microscope analysis sem at 2 0 kv with various magnification the eds and mapping data were obtained by using jsm it200 intouchscop meanwhile the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of catalyst particles were determined by a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer using cu kα as the x ray source the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was analyzed between 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 using ftir 6300 equipment the phzpc was determined using drift method 39 2 4 2 determination of mineralization degree of ofl degradation efficiency of ofl was measured using uv vis spectrophotometer shimazu model z2000 japan at λ 293 nm the solution ph was detected by a ph meter si analytics the leaching iron concentrations into solution were monitored by coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model ultima expert horiba france the concentrations of h2o2 were determined by the iodometric titration method 40 the total organic carbon toc was detected by a toc 4200 analyzer shimadzu japan the mineralization efficiency of ofl after ozonation was determined by analyzing chemical oxygen demand cod concentration

excel microsoft and origin 9 0 sofwares were used to treat the obtained experimental data the results were expressed as average value standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of the modification ratio in this study the experiments to study effect of magnetic modification ratio on the removal efficiency of ofl by o3 fenton was performed with varying impregnation ratios between mixture of fe3 fe2 and fs at 5 10 15 and 20 w w at h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l catalyst dosage of 1 5 g l under ph of 9 during 100 min of contact time the ofl mineralization efficiency was evaluated through removal efficiency of cod the results are presented in fig 2 what stands out from data in fig 1 is that the ofl removal efficiency in o3 mfs systems was higher than that in o3 fs the mineralization efficiency of ofl by o3 fenton using modified fs at a composite ratio of 5 mfs 5 reached a peak of 70 however there are no correlation between modification ratios with the ofl removal efficiencies to be specific the ofl removal efficiency saw a fall trend when composite ratios were further increased over 5 the higher modification ratios were the lower ofl removal efficiencies were the mineralization efficiency of ofl was 50 96 44 83 and 38 69 by o3 fenton respectively at composite ratios of 10 15 and 20 of fe3 fe2 mixture a high impregnation ratio of fe3 fe2 can caused consumption of oh in the presence of organic compounds 43 besides molar ratio between fenton reagent and h2o2 also affected the mineralization of stabilized leachate 32 in this study the author showed the removal efficiency of cod color and nh3 n was the highest at a molar ratio between h2o2 fe2 of 1 moreover the catalyst s surface active sites became saturating and overlapping by attack of iron ions at a high composite ratio the similar results were reported by ling et al 2011 44 who studied on loading of fe iii on activated carbon as catalyst for improving heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of omethoate with optimal composite ratio of fe iii at 5 these results can be further confirmed through the catalysts properties data specifically the xrd pattern illustrated the occurrence of feo and fe3o4 in mainly constituent of mfs 5 with mass ratio was higher in comparison with fs by two times eds data as a result it is clear that the impregnation of fs in mixture of fe3 fe2 significantly improved the ofl removal efficiency and at impregnation ratio of 5 for the maximum ofl mineralization efficiency thus the mfs 5 was chosen as heterogeneous catalyst for the integrated o3 fenton in degradation of ofl in the following investigations 3 2 characteristics of catalyst the textural and surface chemical characteristics of fs and mfs 5 are expressed in table 2 the data in table 2 showed that both fs and mfs 5 belong to non porous material the increase in sbet of modified catalyst compared with raw catalyst was due to synergetic effects among the components such as enriched feo fe3o4 and sio2 in the mfs 5 constituent after modification process it is noticeable that growth in sbet of catalyst mfs 5 by about 7 5 times through modifying by mixture of magnetic would facilitate the separation of charge carries surface catalytic activity and redox sites in the catalyst structures leading to improve electron transfer of magnetic composite catalyst besides the high sbet of mfs 5 is beneficial for adsorption of ofl on the mfs 5 s surface which resulted in improving oxidation performance of ofl adsorbed on the catalyst surface by oh radicals 18 the surface morphology of fs and mfs 5 catalysts was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem and the results are illustrated in fig 3a d from the fig 3a d both fs and mfs 5 had the amorphous structure coarse and heterogeneous surface the data also show that both catalysts belong to porous material but the porous structure on the mfs 5 was more clearly moreover after modified by mixture of fe3 fe2 the presence of both feo and fe3o4 on the surface of fs produces more dispersed particles the mfs 5 possessed many particles with the smaller and rougher structure in comparison with particles of fs the surface of mfs 5 composite is fully covered due to the large amount of feo and fe3o4 immobilized in the composite resulting in the surfaces of mfs 5 composite coarser than that of raw fs besides the modification process makes iron ions reacted and destructed the large particles structure of raw fs into smaller particles the results confirmed the successful loading of mixture fe3 fe2 on the raw fs generating mfs 5 composite the presence of fe and other elements are exhibited by eds and mapping data in fig 2c f and b e the iron occurred on the mfs at optimal modification ratio of 5 was higher than of in fs by about twice besides there was presence of o al si and s in constituent of both fs and mfs 5 such the change in the mass ratio of iron on the surface of the mfs 5 composite would lead to a remarkable growth in catalytic activity thanks to change in the active sites available in the catalyst s surface the results further confirm that the iron ions were successfully loaded onto raw fs catalyst resulting in promoting degradation rate of the ofl by ozone fenton systems using mfs 5 as catalyst chemical bonds on the surface of fs and mfs 5 were studied using ftir and the spectra are illustrated in fig 3a the occurrence of bands at about 450 and 551 cm 1 are attributed to al o si and si o si deformations 22 the absorption band at about 798 cm 1 represents to sio in sio2 28 the band at about 988 cm 1 proved the presence of al al oh bending vibration while that at 1095 cm 1 is due to the sio stretching 28 there was the vibration of hydroxyl groups oh stretching appeared at a peak of 3000 and 3500 cm 1 can be assigned for al oh in both fs and mfs 5 45 the peak at 1735 cm 1 is related to the bending mode of these hydroxyl groups 46 cc groups at peaks ranging from 2353 cm 1 in fs is moved to 2296 cm 1 in mfs 5 the co groups were also observed at peaks from 1013 to 1209 cm 1 after modified by magnetic composite the peaks within 1500 1329 cm 1 which represented coo groups appeared in mfs 5 are less intense compared to those of raw fs due to interaction between fe2 and fe3 and the oxygen of coo groups because the carboxyl group plays the key role in metal adsorption moreover this result can also be due to link of iron ions with alo and sio in raw iron slag 45 the xrd patterns of both fs and mfs at various modification ratios are illustrated in fig 3b it can be seen from data in fig 3b that all catalysts had amorphous structure the presence of feo fe3 so4 2 oh 6 fe3o4 and sio2 in the fig 3b further confirmed data in sem ftir and eds and mapping data among synthesized catalysts it is clear that amount of both hematite feo and magnetite fe3o4 occurred in the mfs 5 was the highest almost characteristic peaks were well indexed to amorphous with a highly graphite crystal structure in the xrd spectra of all catalysts 38 the result of the xrd patterns indicates the main constituent supported for ozone fenton process to mineralize ofl antibiotic was mainly thanks to occurrence of ferrous dioxide and silicon dioxide in fs and mfs 5 3 3 comparison of different processes in removal of ofl to study synergic effect and participation of various treatment processes in removal of ofl a series of experiments were conducted to compare the ofl treatment efficiency between processes for reactors the h2o2 dosage was fixed at 100 mg l mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l and initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l all experiments were performed under same ph of 9 0 at room temperature 25 2 c time course of ofl removal by different treatment processes and catalytic potential is indicated in fig 4 from data in fig 4a among these treatment processes the adsorption of ofl by mfs 5 was considered control test the removal of ofl by adsorption onto mfs 5 was found to be 8 9 for 100 min of contact time a low value in the ofl removal efficiency by adsorption onto mfs 5 suggested the contribution of adsorption in removal of ofl was inconsiderable similarly oxidation of ofl from water by h2o2 oxidizing agent only was low 8 7 equaling with the ofl removal by adsorption onto mfs 5 however a combination between h2o2 and mfs 5 heterogeneous catalyst in fenton system gave a growth in the ofl degradation efficiency up 18 09 which was higher than that of total efficiencies of both oxidation by h2o2 and adsorption onto mfs 5 for ozonation of ofl by alone ozone oxidizing agent degradation of ofl reached 26 63 the low ofl oxidation efficiency was due to low utilization rate of ozone and selective attack of ozone 48 when the h2o2 was added into ozonation the perozone efficiency of ofl reached 52 12 which was higher than that of two times by o3 in the heterogeneous catalytic catazone o3 mfs 5 the ofl degradation efficiency was 53 98 which was the same as the oxidation efficiency of perozone process however there was a noticeable upward trend in the ofl removal efficiency when o3 was integrated with fenton reagent h2o2 mfs 5 in the o3 fenton system the ofl degradation efficiency peaked at 70 0 this value was higher than that of sum of degradation efficiencies of both o3 only and fenton h2o2 mfs 5 44 72 by about 1 6 times from the results as can be seen the o3 fenton for the highest removal efficiency of ofl from aqueous solution the supplementation of fenton reagent into ozonation system enhanced the ofl degradation efficiency went up 43 37 the results was attributed to be fenton reagent accelerated decomposing o3 to form more oh a integrated treatment process of o3 and fenton has been found to generate the synergetic effects between o3 and fenton like oxidation leading to enhancement of overall degradation efficiency of ofl and overcoming their respective drawbacks 10 the integrated treatment process was initiated with oxidation of h2o2 by iron ions which were contained in the constituent of mfs 5 catalyst through fenton s reaction to form the main sources of oh then the reaction continued to be further catalyzed through reduction of fe3 as well as fe3 ions reaction with o3 to form more oh for attack into aromatic ring structure of ofl as described by following equations 10 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 4 fe 3 h 2 o fe 2 h oh 5 fe 3 o 3 feo 2 h o 2 oh the analogue results were reported by several previous works on studying combination of o3 and homogeneous fenton in degradation of various persistent organic pollutant for example li et al 2015 49 investigated degradation of amoxicillin by o3 fenton using rotating packed bed rpb the results showed that cod removal rate reached a peak of 65 and bod5 cod ratio was grown from 0 to 0 38 after o3 fenton treatment the result was due to synergic effect between o3 and fenton the stabilized leachate was treated using the o3 fenton process 32 after treated the degradation efficiency of cod was increased while o3 consumption decreased by the addition of fenton reagent into the ozonation system the synergistic effect between catalyst and oxidants in the o3 fenton system was also proved in some previous works using catalytic potential and enhancement factor r 50 based on data obtained from the recent study both the catalytic potential of mfs 5 and the synergistic effect between various applied processes in integrated o3 fenton system were determined using eqs 6 and 7 respectively in eq 6 the removal efficiency of ofl by integrated process was compared with that those achieved by individual mfs 5 h2o2 and o3 systems the synergistic effect was described based on enhancement factor r as explained in eq 7 herein the removal efficiency of ofl by o3 and h2o2 mfs 5 and by integrated o3 fenton processes was compared referring to eq 7 a significant catalytic potential of 52 1 was obtained for mfs 5 during o3 mfs 5 h2o2 process fig 4b showing that the coupling of fenton agent and o3 for the degradation of ofl was effective technique this result was due to the efficient formation of hydroxyl radicals via effectively decomposition of o3 and h2o2 molecules by both si and fe ions on the catalyst constituents besides towards enhancement factor the values of r are defined between 0 and 1 0 when r 1 0 displaying the integrated effect is lower than sum of the single effects while at r 1 shows the integrated effect is much higher than sum of the individual effects at r 1 the integrated effect equals sum of the individual effects in this study from data in the fig 4a the value of r was calculated to be 1 58 demonstrating the significant synergistic effect between applied techniques in o3 fenton system therefore integrated o3 fenton system was chosen as the most effective process in removal of ofl at next experiments 6 r r o 3 fenton r mfs 5 r o 3 r h 2 o 2 7 r ofl removed by o 3 fenton ofl removed by o 3 h 2 o 2 mfs 5 3 4 effect of solution ph the solution ph plays a vital roles in ozonation of ofl in this study the experiment to study effect of solution ph on the ofl mineralization by ozonation perozone and ozone fenton systems was conducted by varying solution ph values between 3 5 7 9 and 11 with fixing initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l during 100 min of reaction time time course of ofl mineralization is shown in fig 5 from data in fig 5 it is clear that ozonation degradation of ofl was favored in alkaline medium and the degradation of ofl by all ozonation systems maximized at ph of 9 the ofl removal efficiency of o3 perozone and o3 fenton reached respectively 26 63 52 17 and 69 09 at ph of 9 the result showed that ozone decomposition strongly depended on ph value of the solution and basic ph is beneficial to ozone decomposition to generate more oh leading to promoting the degradation of ofl 11 besides the degradation of persistent organic compounds by heterogeneous fenton was also proved to be effective at high ph 26 this result was because the growth in hydroxyl ion concentration enhanced the hydroxyl radicals generation through hydroxyl ion reaction with o3 according to following equations 32 8 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 9 o 3 ho 2 2o 2 oh and the indirect oxidation reaction proceeds at a quicker rate under ph of 9 moreover the surface charge analysis results of mfs 5 showed that the phzpc of catalyst was 9 8 at solution ph of 9 phzpc the surface of mfs 5 became positively charge besides the ofl is a zwitterionic compound containing an equal number of positively and negatively charged functional groups in solution with two pka values of 6 10 and 8 28 51 because of these properities the ofl molecules were often negatively charged or positively charged depending on solution ph values the previous study showed that the ofl molecules are negatively charged at ph 8 28 52 as a result there was a high adsorption tendency between catalyst and contaminant molecules at solution ph of 9 through electrostatic interactions leading to a remarkable promotion in the performance of ofl degradation process also xrd and eds data indicated there was feo and fe3o4 existed in constituent of mfs 5 catalyst the fe3o4 was proved to be exhibition effective catalytic activity for promoting ozone decomposition into oh radicals in alkaline medium 48 and among ozonation systems the ozone fenton gave the highest removal efficiency of ofl this can be due to adding fenton reagent into ozonation reaction enhanced effective generation of more oh radicals for degradation of ofl from water 10 29 31 32 however a further increase in ph value to 11 led a fall in removal efficiency of ofl this was due to a excess amount of radicals caused by dissociation of h2o2 which triggered a decreased effectiveness of ozone when reacting with ofl 32 the analogue results were achieved by previous studies for example treatment efficiency of matured landfill leachate using o3 fenton reached peak at ph of 7 9 32 ozonation of landfill leachate with cod removal efficiency of 41 at ph of 11 53 degradation of textile wastewater by solar photo fenton o3 was maximum at ph of 9 7 treatment of tpa wastewater by o3 h2o2 fe2 uv reached a peak at ph of 8 5 29 however the results were contrasted with those reached in study of li et al 2015 49 who applied o3 fenton for degradation amx with a maximum removal efficiency of amx of 48 9 at ph of 3 the reason of this result was due to a decrease of the fe ii availability at high ph leading to inhibition of the reaction between h2o2 and fe ii in homogeneous fenton to form oh 3 5 effect of h2o2 concentration in perozone reaction the presence of h2o2 is considered initiation agent for degradation of o3 through hydroperoxite ho2 ho2 continues to react with o3 to form o3 and ho2 after finishing a reaction chain total 2 oh is generated as described by following equation 10 h 2 o 2 2o 3 2 oh 3o 2 also in fenton reaction h2o2 directly reacts with fe2 and fe3 ions in constituent of modified iron slag to form oh it is clear that reaction rate in both fenton and ozonation processes strongly depends on h2o2 concentration thus there is existence of optimal concentration of h2o2 for maximum degradation rate of ofl thus effect of h2o2 dosage on the degradation of ofl was studied with varying h2o2 dosage from 50 to 250 mg l at ph of 9 initial concentration of ofl of 100 mg l with 1 5 g l of mfs 5 dosage the result is illustrated in fig 6 what stands out from data in fig 6 is that there was existence of optimal dosage of h2o2 in both perozone and ozone fenton which gave maximum degradation efficiency of ofl the degradation of ofl reached a peak of 52 17 and 69 09 respectively for perozone and ozone fenton at h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l a low h2o2 concentration of 50 mg l gave a low degradation of ofl reaching 27 04 and 38 17 respectively for perozone and ozone fenton however when increasing further h2o2 concentration over 100 mg l the ofl mineralization saw a considerable downward trend the ofl mineralization efficiency decreased corresponding with an increase in h2o2 concentration specifically the ofl mineralization efficiency was 29 51 23 10 and 16 69 for perozone and 39 07 31 25 and 26 88 for ozone fenton corresponding with h2o2 concentration of 150 200 and 250 mg l in fact in the ozone fenton system the reaction between iron ions and h2o2 enhanced formation of oh according to eq 11 33 11 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 oh h such oh formed has the potential to destroy the ofl however a too high ratio of h2o2 fe2 fe3 had insignificant improvement in the ofl degradation due to the scavenging effect of peroxide on the oh as described in eqs 12 and 13 54 12 oh h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 13 oh ho 2 oh ho 2 moreover degradation of ofl was decreased because of dissociation of h2o2 in aqueous solution into ho2 which has weak attack in the aromatic ring structure of ofl 33 and the recombination of oh eq 14 also decreased the ofl removal efficiency 29 14 2 oh h 2 o 2 in contrast an insufficient amount of h2o2 to react with iron ions o3 and oh also led to a decrease in oxidation ability of perozone and ozone fenton 33 thus in this study it is clear that the adding h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l in to perozone and ozone fenton reactions enhanced degradation of ofl because the h2o2 reacted with both o3 and feo and fe3o4 presence in constituent of mfs 5 catalyst as described in following equations 21 15 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 16 o 3 ho 2 oh o 2 o 2 17 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 18 o 3 h ho 3 19 ho 3 oh o 2 from discussion as abovementioned the h2o2 concentration of 100 mg l was chosen as the most suitable value for oxidation of ofl by ozonation systems in this study 3 6 effect of initial ofloxacin concentration the effect of initial ofl concentration on mineralization of ofl by ozonation only perozone and ozone fenton was investigated in practical initial pollutant concentration is an important operational parameter which determined cost as well as feasibility of treatment technology in this study investigating influence of initial ofl concentration on mineralization of ofl by ozonation systems was carried out with varying initial ofl concentrations between 50 and 250 mg l at ph of 9 h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l during 100 min of contact time the effect of initial ofl concentration on the mineralization of ofl is shown in fig 7 fig 7 indicated that the mineralization efficiency of ofl decreased with increasing initial ofl concentration from 50 to 250 mg l for all ozonation systems the ofl mineralization efficiency by the ozone fenton system was higher than those of other systems at all applied ofl concentrations the ofl mineralization efficiency maximized at 100 mg l of initial ofl concentration specifically removal of cod reached 30 c co 0 7 55 c co 0 45 and 70 c co 0 3 respectively for o3 alone perozone and o3 fenton the results were because at a high initial concentration of ofl corresponded with a growth in number of ofl molecules while h2o2 and mfs 5 dosages were constant consequently the formed oh radical amount is constant as a result degradation of ofl was reduced 10 besides there was a significant different between ofl removal efficiency at initial ofl concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l this is due to at very low concentration of ofl the dosage of h2o2 is too high to react with ofl leading to consumption of oh by this excess h2o2 besides at a too high initial concentration of ofl caused saturating of catalyst s surface by overlapping of ofl molecules moreover intermediate products were generated during degradation reactions of ofl by ozonation also competed adsorption sites on the catalyst s surface causing inhibition of degradation rate of ofl by these reactions 10 54 the similar results were reported by scholars for instance mineralization of rhb by fenton like oxidation using magnetic iron containing waste slag composite catalyst reached a peak at 100 mg l of rhb with removal efficiency of 83 33 39 removal of cod in the distillery industrial effluent by the o3 uv fe2 h2o2 decreased from 100 to 75 and from 100 to 63 with rising cod from 1500 to 6000 mg l and optimal cod concentration for o3 uv fe2 h2o2 reaction was 3000 mg l with a removal efficiency of 95 5 10 mineralization of rr24 by ozonation and fenton was also found decreased when initial rr24 concentration increased 55 3 7 effect of catalyst dosage the supplementation of catalyst into ozonation reactions affected chemisorption of the ofl on the catalyst s surface and was a first important step for the catalytic reaction because adsorbed ofl particles were then mineralized by o3 or oh therefore effect of catalyst dosage on the mineralization of ofl by ozone fenton was studied with fixing solution ph of 9 h2o2 of 100 mg l initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l and varying mfs 5 catalyst dosages from 0 5 to 2 5 g l over 100 min of reaction time time course of mineralization of ofl at various mfs 5 dosages is showed in fig 8 fig 8 indicated that the mineralization efficiency of ofl witnessed an upward trend when catalyst dosage increased from 0 5 to 1 5 g l the degradation of ofl maximized at mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l with 69 76 of ofl removal efficiency the result was because a growth in mfs 5 dosage enhanced rate of ozone decomposition and interaction between h2o2 with iron ions in constituent of mfs 5 and thus the generation of more oh radicals such formed oh radicals were accelerated thanks to the feo and fe3o4 on the mfs 5 surfcace during catalytic ozone fenton reaction of ofl besides the growth in mfs 5 dosage increased the number of adsorption and reactive sites between h2o2 and mfs 5 which corresponded with the rise in production of oh radicals as a result the mineralization efficiency of ofl was enhanced basiri and rafiee 2016 56 reported the ozonation rate of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol increased when growing dosage of zno nanocatalyst however when the mfs 5 dosage was further increased degradation of ofl fell at too high catalyst dosage may result in negative effect on mineralization efficiency of ofl due to the excess catalyst causing a reduction in surface area available for adsorption of ofl molecules and scavenging oh which led to a decrease in catalytic activity of mfs 5 another reason was because h2o2 dosage was fixed while mfs 5 dosage was increased in ozone fenton reaction thus amount of h2o2 was insufficient to continue reacting with excess mfs 5 particles to form more oh besides when mfs 5 dosage was high both oxidizing agents oh or feo 2 were discarded by iron ions in constituent of mfs 5 through the parasitic reactions eqs 20 and 21 respectively leading to limitation of the formation of oh radical 29 20 oh fe 2 fe 3 oh 21 feo 2 fe 2 2h 2fe 3 h 2 o the analogue result was found by mansouri et al 2015 33 when using o3 fe2 h2o2 system for degradation of endocrine disrupting compound the study showed that a further increase in fe2 concentration 0 5 10 2 mol l led to a decrease in the dep removal rate because the excess of fe ii ions will consume the radicals leading to the decrease in process efficiency 3 8 utilization efficiency of o3 and h2o2 decomposition the utilization efficiency of o3 and h2o2 were studied at the optimal reaction conditions of ofl removal process by o3 fenton system and the obtained results are indicated in fig a2 as can be seen in fig a2a the h2o2 concentration can be decreased to 10 9 mg l with a utilization efficiency of h2o2 calculated of 89 2 besides the average flow rates of o3 in effluent and exhaust gases concentration which were discharged from the reactor during oxidation process of ofl were about 0 008 0 001 mg min and 0 469 0 02 mg l respectively and the efficiency of ozone utilization reached 95 69 fig a2b the results suggested that the pore structure and large surface area of the modified catalyst provided sufficient reaction sites and supported active metal oxides for the catalysis of further o3 fenton system for the generation of more hydroxyl radicals thus resulting in nearly complete ozone and h2o2 consumption this result is consistent with those of ahmadi et al 2017 59 and xu et al 2020 14 the enhanced efficiency of decomposition of o3 and h2o2 during heterogeneous catalytic ozonation in presence of fenton agent could be attributed to the supported fe and si metal oxides and their activation in addition the efficiency of ozone transfer between liquid gaseous phases was improved and the reaction equilibrium shifted towards ozone depletion under the role of the catalyst 3 9 kinetic and mechanism studies with assuming that the oh radical concentration reaches steady state during the ozonation process of ofl the mineralization of ofl is considered following an apparent first order reaction and reaction rate of ozonation is proportional to cod removal therefore the ozonation reaction kinetic can be described by the following equations 22 ln c c o k d t where co and c indicate concentration of ofl at the initial time of reaction and at t min of reaction respectively by plotting ln c co versus reaction time the experimental data were fitted as a straight line and kd apparent first order rate constant was determined as the slope of the line the kinetic data of mineralization of ofl by all ozone only perozone and ozone fenton at various solution ph initial ofl concentration h2o2 dosages scavengers and mfs 5 dosages are illustrated in fig a3 the data in fig a3 showed that there was a high linearity of the plots which confirmed degradation process of ofl followed pseudo first order kinetic model with the high correlation coefficient values r2 between 0 91 and 0 99 as desired the calculated kd values had well agreement with removal efficiencies of ofl at all studied conditions to be specific the obtained kd values of o3 fenton o3 h2o2 o3 at all operational conditions for effect of solution ph on the degradation of ofl the kd reached a peak at ph of 9 the maximum kd were 0 0043 0 0101 and 0 0187 min for o3 o3 h2o2 and o3 fenton respectively fig a3a besides the pseudo first order model described accurately the mineralization kinetic of ofl with high values of r2 0 93 for all ozonation systems in terms of the effect of initial ofl concentration the kd values saw a downward trend corresponded with an increase in initial ofl concentration and followed the same order of mineralization efficiency of ofl the mineralization efficiency of o3 fenton system was higher that those of both o3 and perozone at all applied initial ofl concentrations fig a3b towards effect of h2o2 dosage on the mineralization of ofl the maximum kd values respectively were 0 0088 and 0 0135 min for perozone and ozone fenton at 100 mg l of h2o2 a too low or too high of h2o2 dosage was supplemented into ozonation reaction led to a low kd similarly the high r2 values were also achieved in this experiment which further confirmed the ofl mineralization by ozonation systems followed the pseudo first order fig a3c in term of effect of mfs 5 dosage on the pseudo first order rate constant the kd reached higher values when the dosage of mfs 5 catalyst was risen from 0 5 g l to 1 5 g l for o3 fenton system and the mineralization efficiency of ofl reached a peak of 0 0139 min at mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l however there were a downward trend in kd values with a further increase in mfs 5 dosage over 1 5 g l fig a3e in this study it is clear that supplementation of fenton reagent h2o2 mfs 5 into ozonation system strongly enhanced mineralization rate of ofl under all experimental conditions the supposed main mechanisms for promotion of ofl degradation by integrated o3 fenton system included 1 direct by ozone self decomposition and 2 indirect through oh radicals formed from decomposition of o3 and h2o2 by metallic sites on the mfs 5 catalyst surface 11 however experiment to investigate effect of solution ph on the degradation of ofl by o3 fenton showed a high mineralization efficiency of ofl occurred in alkaline medium with ph of 9 thus ozonation process of ofl through formed oh radicals during in this o3 fenton reaction can be main mechanism degradation of persistent organic pollutants by aops namely by heterogeneous fenton and ozonation is attributed through hydroxyl radicals oh which are continuously formed in fenton oxidation and ozonation of pops therefore in this study to confirm contribution of oh in mineralization of ofl a series of scavengers including t butanol cl and hco3 were supplemented into perozone and ozone fenton reactions the experiments were performed at optimal conditions of solution ph h2o2 dosage initial ofl concentration and mfs 5 dosage which were found in the above experiments to be specific the experiment to study effect of scavengers on the mineralization of ofl was conducted with fixing solution ph of 9 0 h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l at 1 5 g l of mfs 5 with adding 100 mg l of t butanol 100 mg l of cl and 100 mg l of hco3 in separate into perozone and o3 fenton reactions the mineralization efficiency of ofl by above systems is presented in fig 9 the obtained kd and r2 values by these systems are indicated in fig a3d tert butanol is considered a well known scavenger of oh radical because of its very rapid reaction rate with oh 29 besides cl and hco3 also are inorganic ions existed popular in water and wastewater which seriously inhibit reaction rate by scavenging oh radicals thus 100 mg l of t butanol cl and hco3 was added into perozone and ozone fenton to further ascertain mineralization mechanism of ofl through oh radical formed during reaction process what stands out from data in fig 9 is that the ofl degradation rate was seriously slowed down in presence of t butanol cl and hco3 on the contrary in reaction without scavengers the ofl degradation occurred with the highest rate of 0 0099 and 0 0139 min respectively for perozone and ozone fenton and supplementation of mfs 5 catalyst into perozone enhanced degradation reaction rate of ofl by 1 5 times as can be shown in fig 9 the reaction with adding t butanol led to a strongest inhibition of ofl degradation there was no nearly degradation of ofl in this reaction the inhibition effect of ofl degradation was followed in reaction with adding cl with kd of 0 0033 and 0 0073 min respectively for perozone and ozone fenton the inhibition effect of ofl degradation was the lowest in reaction with supplementation of hco3 the results confirmed that oh radical is the main factor to control the mechanism of perozone and ozone fenton of ofl degradation the results also showed that mfs 5 could play an important role as catalyst for the o3 fenton system by continuously production of oh causing promotion of ofl degradation by these formed oh radicals as can be seen from the data in fig 9 all t butanol cl and hco3 were scavengers to decompose the oh leading to the remarkable decrease in the mineralization of ofl by both perozone and ozone fenton these results agreed with degradation of tpa using o3 h2o2 fe2 uv 29 with adding tert butanol leading to strong decrease in tpa mineralization besides data about physical chemical properties of mfs 5 catalyst further confirmed degradation enhancement mechanism of ofl by integrated o3 fenton in the o3 fenton reaction iron ions and h2o2 greatly promoted the ozone decomposition leading to the generation of more hydroxyl radicals which enhanced mineralization rate of ofl the degradation mechanism of ofl by o3 fenton was very complex which was combination of direct ozone attack reactions adsorption by catalyst and indirect mechanism through free oh radical occurring both in water phase and on the mfs 5 surface specifically the presence of feo fe3o4 and sio2 in the constituent of mfs 5 catalyst xrd graph in fig 3b which played role both as an adsorbent and catalyst in the o3 fenton during o3 fenton of ofl both o3 and h2o2 were adsorbed on the mfs 5 s surface then mfs 5 would act as a heterogeneous catalyst to produce active sites on its surface the constituents of feo fe3o4 and sio2 presence in mfs 5 promoted ozone decomposition and both feo fe3o4 reacted with h2o2 in aqueous solution to form more oh radicals in system finally both mfs 5 and formed oh took part ozone fenton reaction for mineralization of ofl besides due to transfer of electron several iron elements in feo fe3o4 constituent were changed into fe2 and fe3 ions these iron ions were then combined with ozone to increase degradation rate of o3 leading to effectively improvement the utilization rate of o3 to 95 69 which caused generation of more hydroxyl radicals for degradation of ofl 55 moreover a part of si element in sio2 can be transferred into si4 which also participated in decomposition of o3 to form oh 55 the reactions for production of oh are similar to diffusion controlled reaction and are caused by the three step mechanism as follows 1 abstracting h atom 2 adding oh to cc ring and 3 interaction between oh with n atom in constituent of ofl 9 from above discussion it is clear that the feo fe3o4 and sio2 on the mfs 5 surface played an important role in enhancement of ofl degradation rate by o3 fenton thanks to mfs 5 s adsorption ability towards h2o2 o3 and pollutants on the its surface leading to accelerate decomposing o3 to react with h2o2 available in solution to form more oh the oh radicals then continued to attack aromatic ring structure of contaminants and transform them into intermediate products co2 and h2o 38 in this study the ofl was mineralized mainly through oh radical formed during ozone fenton through mechanisms as above discussed the main reactions related to oxidation mechanism of o3 fenton process are indicated in eqs 23 31 23 fe 2 o 3 fe 3 o 3 24 o 3 h o 2 oh 25 fe 2 o 3 feo 2 o 2 26 feo 2 h 2 o fe 3 oh oh 27 h 2 o 2 h ho 2 28 o 3 ho 2 oh o 2 o 2 29 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 30 o 3 h ho 3 31 ho 3 oh o 2 furthermore from eds analysis as shown in fig 2 the proportion of fe si elements in constituent of fs after modification by mixture of fe3 fe2 was increased by two times which proved for improvement of catalytic activity of mfs 5 in degradation of ofl by enriched metals on the catalyst s surface besides the ftir data fig 3a also showed there was appearance of oh groups on the mfs 5 s surface moreover the surface of metal oxides including feo fe3o4 and sio2 in aqueous solution is easy to be hydroxylated by the dissociative chemisorption of water molecules these hydroxyl groups would release proton and act as the brönsted acid sites however the adsorbed water molecules could then be desorbed along with the formation of metal cations and coordinately unsaturated oxygen which can act as the lewis acids and lewis bases respectively surface hydroxyl groups and these sites are responsible for catalytic ozonation reactions of ofl from aqueous solution 48 besides thanks to presence of h2o2 in fenton agent o3 was decomposed to form o3 initiating for a reaction chain to form hydroperoxide anion ho2 32 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 33 ho 2 o 3 o 3 ho 2 the next reactions to form oh in presence of magnetic catalyst mfs 5 for mineralization of ofl by o3 fenton system can be described as following equations 34 mfs 5 o 3 h mfs 5 ho 3 35 mfs 5 ho 3 oh o 2 36 mfs 5 ho 2 mfs 5 o 2 h 37 mfs 5 o 2 o 3 mfs 5 o 3 o 2 38 mfs 5 o 3 h mfs 5 ho 3 39 mfs 5 ho 3 oh o 2 totally thanks to presence of h2o2 in fenton agent which was added into ozonation system two oh formed one h2o2 decomposed eqs 35 and 39 from abovementioned results and discussion it is clear that integration between o3 and fenton agent using magnetic composite heterogeneous catalyst produced more active radicals which consisted of oh o2 leading to completely mineralization of ofl as described by following general equation eq 40 40 active oxidizing radicals ofl intermediates co 2 h 2 o in summary the adding h2o2 mfs 5 fenton reagent into the ozonation reaction strongly enhanced degradation of ofl antibiotic through synergetic effect of o3 h2o2 mfs 5 in same system by increasing amount of formed oh radicals the feo fe3o4 and sio2 constituents on the mfs 5 surface attributed to be main factor which adsorbed o3 h2o2 and ofl on the its surface as well as promoted decomposition of o3 to react with h2o2 with aim to form more oh radicals to degrade effectively ofl from wastewater the mechanism of integrated o3 fenton process for mineralization of ofl could be illustrated in fig 10 3 10 mineralization and degradation pathway of ofl the experiment for investigation of mineralization efficiency of ofl by o3 fenton was conducted under optimal conditions of ph of 9 mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l initial ofl of 100 mg l and h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l over 100 min of reaction time what stands out from fig a4 is that after 100 min of reaction time 96 7 ofl was degraded and 62 toc removal was obtained by using o3 fenton system the toc reduction was slower than ofl reduction under the same conditions there was a difference in toc removal efficiency and ofl degradation was because the decomposition of ofl molecules formed intermediates products these intermediate products requested longer time to completely mineralize into co2 and h2o by study of degradation routes of ofl in the previous studies this study recommended the ofl degradation pathway by o3 fenton as shown in the fig 11 13 14 40 57 58 thanks to oxidation of o3 and unselective attacked of oh various intermediate products were formed during mineralization of ofl by o3 fenton in pathway a in the first step the cc double bonds were broken down during catalytic ozonation which was continuously followed by the benzene ring opening reaction 14 three o2 atoms were added to the double bonds in which two of them were linked together dp1 the remaining o2 atom combined with hydrogen to produce oh groups and cc bonds dp2 besides the formed intermediate products continue to react with hydroxyl radicals to form multiple biodegradable products dp3 dp4 in pathway b fluoride in ofl was removed to form dp5 40 57 then the oh radicals produced during o3 fenton process attacked into piperazinyl substituent oxazinyl substituent and carboxyl group in the ofl structure the directly cleavage of the piperazinyl substituent of ofl by oh formed dp6 dp7 dp8 and dp9 besides the carboxyl group was also removed by oh to produce co2 resulting in the transformation of dp10 moreover the hydroxyl radicals attacked the oxazinyl substituent to form dp12 clearly both ring of piperazinyl substituent oxazinyl substituent were attacked by hydroxyl radicals in the o3 fenton leading to production of small molecular weight carboxylic acids and inorganic molecules such co2 and h2o 3 11 treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by o3 fenton the experiment for investigating treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by o3 fenton was performed at optimal conditions which obtained from lab scale experiment characteristics of real pharmaceutical wastewater are presented in table 3 from data in table 3 it is clear that the pharmaceutical wastewater belongs to low biodegradability with very low of bod5 cod ratio of 0 15 therefore the wastewater needs to pre treat to improve bod5 cod ratio facilitating for following biological treatment in this study the integrated o3 fenton system was applied to removal of persistent organic compounds from this wastewater and the results are showed in fig 12 as is illustrated by fig 11 71 cod removal and 62 toc removal were achieved by using o3 fenton system after 100 min reaction the results is because of the fact that by modification of fs using mixture of magnetic composite the pore volume and specific surface area of catalyst was well developed which caused more ofl molecules adsorbed on the catalyst s surface consequently enhancement of decomposition of both o3 and h2o2 to form more oxidative radicals which participated in organics mineralization and subsequently a decrease in cod and toc values during the treatment process 14 18 the results suggested that the raw wastewater pre treated by o3 fenton system accelerated remarkably the degradation of persistent organic compounds into several intermediate metabolites and the biodegradability enhancement of non biodegradable compounds through the o3 fenton process as a result treatment of wastewater by the o3 fenton system can provide favorable conditions for biological treatment 3 12 stability and reusability of catalyst the stability and reusability of mfs 5 play a vital role in its application for treatment of wastewater therefore the used catalyst was separated using an external magnetic field and dried to continue apply for next experiments with aim to evaluate its stability and reusability in this study the experiments were conducted at optimal conditions of ph h2o2 dosage initial ofl concentration and catalyst dosage which found out in abovementioned experiments using o3 fenton reaction the obtained results are presented in fig 13 fig 12a showed that there was negligible change in the mineralization of ofl through five consecutive runs the mineralization efficiency of ofl saw a slight fall from 72 09 to 66 91 after five successive cycles suggesting there has no destroy of mfs 5 during the ozonation process and retained good stability the slight decrease in catalytic efficiency of ozone fenton systems might be due to loss of catalyst in the reuse experiments stability of catalyst was assessed by study on leaching of fe into the reaction solution the results are indicated in fig 12b the concentrations of fe ions were investigated at the optimal reaction conditions the fe2 and fe3 concentrations leached into solution respectively were 0 9 and 2 8 mg l at 100 min reaction it is significantly less than the leaching 18 8 mg l by using fe3o4 ceo2 composite as catalyst 60 leaching iron of 5 mg l in fenton degradation of organic dyes by fe2ges4 61 or 9 8 mg l of leached iron found in heterogeneous fenton with fe3o4 magnetite nanoparticles after 180 reaction min 62 with the low leaching iron ratio proved that applied catalyst in this study was feasible in practical application 4 conclusions combination of various aops commonly causes interesting synergistic effects that can considerably reduce the reaction time and economic cost in this study an iron containing waste natural mineral was successfully modified with magnetic composite of fe3 fe2 and applied as heterogeneous catalyst in fenton process integrated with ozone for degradation of ofl from wastewater this combination explored the synergistic effects between o3 and fenton agent for the mineralization of ofl antibiotic in integrated ozone fenton system with a enhancement factor r of 1 58 and high catalytic potential of 51 2 the comparative study of the ofl removal efficiency of ozone based systems including ozone only perozone and integrated ozone fenton indicated when the fenton reagent was added into ozonation reaction degradation of ofl was strongly enhanced among above studied ozone based systems the mineralization of ofl reached the highest in the o3 fenton system under optimal operational conditions of ph of 9 h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l initial ofl concentration of 100 mg l and mfs 5 dosage of 1 5 g l at these operational conditions the mineralization of ofl evaluated through cod removal obtained 70 analysis data of catalyst s properties illustrated that the mfs 5 was an effective catalyst for ozone fenton system due to presence of high amount of feo fe3o4 and sio2 in the catalyst s constituent study on reaction mechanisms showed that degradation of ofl through two main routes 1 direct ozone self decomposition and 2 indirect ozonation through oh radicals among them degradation of ofl through a huge amount of oh radicals formed from adsorption of h2o2 o3 and ofl by feo fe3o4 and sio2 constituents on the catalyst s surface to accelerate o3 decomposition to react with h2o2 was main mechanism besides the role of oh in degradation of ofl was also further confirmed by conducting the experiments with adding scavengers including tert butanol cl and hco3 as desired the results showed that degradation rates of ofl in the systems with adding scavengers were seriously retarded due to oh scavenging effect by these agents the degradation of ofl followed pseudo first order kinetic model with high values of r2 there was good correlation between calculated kd values with mineralization efficiencies of ofl at various operational conditions of ozonation systems as a result the utilization a modified waste natural mineral as catalyst in integrated ozone fenton system considerably enhanced degradation of ofl antibiotic from wastewater furthermore the mfs 5 catalyst exhibited a high stability with a low leached amount of fe and high reusability through five cycles with a negligible decrease in ofl removal efficiency besides study on treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by integrated ozone fenton system gave high removal efficiencies of both cod and toc suggesting that the o3 fenton was the fully promising and feasible technology in practical application for persistent organic compounds containing wastewater treatment main limitation of this study was not applied the o3 fenton system on the treatment of various real low biodegradable wastewater at large scale therefore the o3 fenton system should be continued deploying application for treatment of different real low biodegradable wastewaters at the wastewater treatment plants in practical in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare
