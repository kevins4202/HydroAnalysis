18065,microplastics as an emerging class of pollutants has become a global concern and is receiving increasing attention interestingly microplastics are always in their ageing process when they enter the real environment our study investigated the ageing properties of polystyrene ps plastics in air pure water and seawater environments at 75 c a two dimensional 2d fourier transform infrared ftir correlation spectroscopy cos analysis was used to better understand the ageing mechanism of the ps plastics based on the 2d cos analysis different ageing mechanisms were identified under different ageing conditions such as an ageing sequence of aged ps particle functional groups in air 1601 cc 1050 c o 1453 c h 1493 c h 1375 c oh 1666 co among the functional group changes o functional groups c o c oh and co were introduced during the ageing process moreover for pristine ps particles hydrophobicity was a major factor for the interaction between the microplastics and organic pollutants for aged ps particles their adsorption capacities were significantly enhanced as the degree of ageing increased the ageing degree of ps was highly responsible for increasing of the specific surface area and the increase in oxygen containing surface groups furthermore there was a significant enhancement in the adsorption affinity for antibiotic contaminants than for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants aged ps particles had little adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons because the presence of oxygen containing surface groups on the aged ps plastics might allow the formation of hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules overall a 2d cos analysis was an effective method for understanding the ageing process of microplastics under different environmental conditions at high temperature these results also clearly demonstrated the characteristics and mechanisms of the interaction between aged microplastics and organic pollutants which could be useful for understanding the environmental behavior of co existing pollutants graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics ageing mechanism 2d cos adsorption organic pollution 1 introduction microplastics mps in the environment defined as polymer particles with a size of less than 5 mm have received increasing attention from scientists and the public charles james 2008 matthew et al 2011 mps have been observed all over the world including in water ecosystems ding et al 2019 eerkesmedrano et al 2015 keller et al 2010 soil rillig 2012 and even several biotas such as fish lusher et al 2013 birds holland et al 2016 and mussels cauwenberghe et al 2015 due to their small size large specific surface area and strong hydrophobicity mps are ideal carriers of many hydrophobic organic pollutants heavy metals potential pathogens and alien species which are prone to causing many environmental problems hodson et al 2017 additionally mps can also be retained in living organisms for a long time furthermore mps can be transferred and enriched in the food web which poses a threat to the balance of the ecosystem and seriously affects human health syberg et al 2015 previous studies on mps have focused on environmental distribution keller et al 2010 rillig 2012 toxicity and adsorption analyses fries 2012 hodson et al 2017 holmes et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 but the understanding of mp changes and ageing mechanisms in the environment remains limited as far as we know after entering the environment mps can undergo accelerated ageing under the action of light oxygen high temperature and environmentally active media which can majorly change the surface morphology microstructure and environmental behavior of common pollutants lambert and wagner 2016 at present studies on mps only focus on the qualitative aspects of ageing such as ageing under ultraviolet light seawater and air hueffer et al 2018 and mueller et al 2018 both found the morphology of the aged polyvinylchloride pvc and polystyrene ps under ultraviolet light changed with ageing and oxygen containing functional groups were incorporated into the polymers during the ageing process liu et al 2019 found that the ageing degree of high density polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps was accelerated by heat activated k2s2o8 and a fenton treatment moreover the o c ratio has been introduced to quantitatively describe the surface ageing characteristics of mps rajakumar et al 2012 examined the natural ageing of plastic films in ambient air and rain they found that the weathered films were found to degrade after a certain number of days of exposure this was found from the steep increases in the carbonyl hydroperoxide hydroxyl lactone ester carboxylic acid and crystallinity indices furthermore a sudden decrease in the elongation at break percentages and tensile strength and the appearance of surface cracks were also observed brandon et al 2016 studied the long term ageing and degradation of polypropylene low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene and found changes in chemical bond structures hydroxyl carbonyl groups and carbon oxygen in a seawater environment these above studies help us to understand the ageing of mps but the understanding of the specific ageing mechanism is still not comprehensive in particular mps have different ageing characteristics and mechanisms under different environmental conditions celina 2013 yousif and haddad 2013 thus a widespread understanding of the ageing mechanisms of plastics is essential to optimizing the environmental behavior of mps two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos based on a set of ftir spectra in response to some external perturbation can potentially reveal the sequential changes of different functional groups sasic et al 2005 at present 2d cos has been widely used to study the interaction mechanism of various matrix macromolecules such as metals nanomaterials and proteins lee et al 2014 tao et al 2018 wei et al 2014 traditional fourier infrared spectroscopy is the most commonly used tool for studying chemical bond changes abdulla et al 2010 although it can show the changes of functional groups of mps during ageing it cannot clearly show the change order of different functional groups guo et al 2020 procter et al 2004 therefore the application of 2d cos characterization can promote the understanding of the dynamic mp ageing process and show the mp ageing process and mechanism more clearly zhou et al 2017 for the pollutants carrying mechanism of mps domestic and foreign scholars have considerable research the sorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs metal ions antibiotics and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs onto mps has been previously investigated fisner et al 2013 hüffer et al 2018 turner and holmes 2015 velzeboer et al 2014 despite the current research on the sorption characteristics and mechanism of heavy metals and organic pollutants on mps being clearly understood the influence of the interaction between aged mps and organic pollutants remains limited in fact mps in the real environment are always in a continuous ageing process and pristine plastics and aged plastics show differences in their adsorption characteristics and mechanism towards pollutants therefore the purpose of this study is to better understand the ageing mechanism of mps and the pollutant carrying mechanism of mps during the ageing process although many studies have examined the ageing of mps almost all studies have been conducted at natural temperatures however elevated temperatures can lead to different chemical reactions than those that occur naturally tidjani 2000 therefore we studied the ageing characteristics and mechanisms of mps in three different environments seawater pure water and air at elevated temperatures the adsorption characteristics and mechanism of organic pollutants with different physical and chemical properties on aged mps were further investigated the adsorption along with alteration were evaluated by adsorbing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and antibiotics which are relatively common organic pollutants through this study we can better understand the environmental process of mps and the environmental behavior of co existing pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ps were purchased from suzhou smartynano technology co ltd suzhou china with average sizes of 1 0 μm tylosin tartrate tyl sulfamethazine smt etythromycin sty phenanthrene phe naphthalene nap and pyrene pyr were obtained from sigma aldrich corporation stlouis mo and stored at 25 c acetonitrile and methanol were chromatographically pure which were bought from the anpu scientific instruments the other solutions were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co china 2 2 ageing experiment all experiments began in april 2018 artificial ageing was carried out in the laboratory over three months the ps samples were exposed to three environments air 75 c seawater 75 c or freshwater 75 c two grams of ps were weighed into quartz glass petri dishes and then covered with quartz glass lids seawater and pure water were added to each of the dishes which was adjusted to ph 7 0 in the 75 c air group only ps particles were added to the petri dish the three mp samples were placed in a thermostat controlled device which maintained the temperature at 75 c the ps samples were removed for different time periods 1 month 2 months and 3 months then the aged samples were washed several times with ultrapure water filtered and dried before further characterization and sorption analysis it is worth noting that the ageing time ranged from 1 month to 3 months during which the seawater and pure water was regularly replenished to ensure that the ps samples were covered the chemical composition of seawater table s1 and seawater replenishment were artificially simulated 2 3 characteristic analysis of aged mps the ftir vetex70 bruker germany was chosen to identify surface groups on the mps and to observe the changes in functional groups of the mps after artificial ageing while scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem 450 fei was applied to observe the surface morphology the ftir spectra were recorded in the 4000 400 cm 1 region with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and 64 scanning times the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was performed to scan the aged mps the scanned aged mps shown that the carbon and oxygen in the uppermost surface layer of the pellets changed during the ageing process additionally the change in crystallinity between the pristine and aged mps were detected using x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany the contact angles of the aged ps were measured using an oca 20 contact angle system dataphysics instruments gmbh germany at room temperature in this work the ageing time was defined as an external disturbance of ps causing a change in ps functional groups during the ageing test based on the work of noda and ozaki dowrey et al 2001 lasch and noda 2019 noda 2006 information on the composition and changed functional groups was obtained ftir spectra integrated with 2d cos were applied using the observed changes in the aged ps particles more detailed information on 2d cos has been described by noda and ozaki and can be found elsewhere lasch and noda 2019 detail in supporting information si 2 4 adsorption test a sorption isotherm is vital for designing a sorption system thus polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and antibiotic adsorption experiments were conducted with different concentrations first each 20 ml brown glass bottle received the same mass of ps plastics 0 025 g then different concentrations of tyl solutions smt solutions sty solutions nap solutions phe solutions and pyr solutions were transferred to plastics bottles containing ps all the samples were placed in thermostatic oscillator at 25 c and oscillated at 150 rpm for 48 h after sorption the solution was filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane filter in a glass bottle to measure the concentration of contaminants each group also had a parallel sample as a reference koh and hno3 were used to adjust the ph of the solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of aged ps particles as demonstrated in fig 1 a the pristine ps particles surfaces were observed to be relatively smooth with spherical shapes the morphology of the ps particles displayed nicked shapes and slight cracking phenomena after 1 month after 3 months the aged ps particles appeared to have much rougher surfaces and multiple cracks along with the formation of rugged textures in addition debris was found on the surface of ps particles aged for 3 months which can be ascribed to the embrittlement and fragmentation of materials horton et al 2017 overall the shape shrunk cracks and pits gradually formed on the surface of the mps as ageing proceeded moreover the ps plastics had different changes at different ageing times and under different ageing conditions fig 1b e the ps particles began to appear some debris after 1 month and debris may be caused by the breakage of mps and a shrunken shape shrinks appeared after 3 months of the air ageing treatment whereas the ps plastics exhibited a slight cracking phenomenon after 1 month and debris was appeared after 3 months of the seawater ageing treatment additionally the morphological features of pure water aged ps did not obviously differ from those of pristine ps fig 1f g in comparison the structural changes on the surfaces of the air aged ps particles were more observable than those in seawater aged and pure water aged ps particles which suggests that ageing in air has a relatively stronger effect to further analyze the structure of aged ps particles under different ageing conditions we performed an xrd analysis of all the composites as shown in fig s1 a low crystallinity was observed for the air aged ps particles these results are similar to those of aged ps particles in sem images 3 2 ftir spectra analysis to further clarify the various characteristics and mechanisms under different ageing conditions ftir spectra was performed to analyze the structure and functional groups of the ps particles as shown in fig 2 the major peaks were concentrated in the regions of 4000 400 cm 1 the characteristic bands at 1050 1375 1453 1493 1601 1666 and 3430 cm 1 displayed strong intensities in the ftir spectra of ps particles peaks of the carbonyl band co stretching vibration and c oh tensile characteristics were observed at 1666 and 1375 cm 1 respectively banks at 1453 and 1493 cm 1 corresponded to the cyclic c h structure of ps particles at 1601 cm 1 caused by cc vibration of aromatic rings were observed and the ir peak at 1050 cm 1was due to the presence of an o c o structure in addition the ftir spectra also indicated that the functional groups change of the ps particles were significantly affected by time the peak intensity increased with increasing ageing time such as the region of 1800 to 1000 cm 1 especially the two small peaks at 1453 and 1493 cm 1 involving in the cyclic c h structures of ps increased at different conditions with increasing ageing time further indicating that the characteristic structures involving in benzene ring of ps were destructed fa et al 2013 lucas and porter 1988 yang et al 2011 moreover the formation of a new peak at 1050 cm 1 was found with the air aged ps particles representing the formation of o c o similarly the peak of o c o was also found with the pure water aged and seawater aged ps particles but the peak for the pure water aged and seawater aged ps particles was much weaker indicating that the formed o c o could be degraded in seawater and pure water brandon et al 2016 additionally the peak of the carbonyl band co increased with the air aged seawater aged and pure water aged samples with increasing ageing time possible reason is that the carbonyl compound could be final product liu et al 2019 however there was a slight increase in the peak intensities of the functional groups between the original and seawater aged ps particles in the ftir these results indicate that the ageing mechanisms of ps particles largely depend on the different ageing conditions celina 2013 yousif and haddad 2013 3 3 2d cos maps on the ageing process of ps particles to further explain the sequence of the various functional group changes and the mechanisms for the aged ps plastics during the ageing process we performed 2d cos analysis based on the one dimensional ftir spectral data and the results are shown in fig 3 the synchronous maps under the three conditions were different in the distribution of peaks six auto peaks were observed at 1050 1375 1453 1493 1601 and 1666 cm 1 along the diagonal line ageing ps had undergone different changes under three different ageing conditions regardless of the different conditions peaks at 1453 1492 and 1601 cm 1 c h and cc on the benzene ring respectively had the highest intensity which may be due to the opening of phenyl rings or the volatilization of small molecules containing phenyl rings from the ps backbone fa et al 2013 lucas and porter 1988 yang et al 2011 in addition the auto peaks for air and seawater ageing had the higher intensities than those with pure water fig 3a c and e moreover positive signs were observed for the three different three conditions of cross peaks in the synchronous maps table 1 indicating that almost all the cross peaks were synchronized during the ageing process among them when ps particles were aged by air the positive sign of all cross peaks φ x 1 1666 0 indicated that the transformation direction of peak at the 1666 cm 1 was similar to the other peaks owing to the increasing intensity of the peak at 1666 cm 1 with increasing ageing time obviously the above findings provide direct evidence on the generation of carbonyl band co in general compared with the general ftir spectrum the synchronous maps of 2d cos analysis can provide deeper insights into the functional groups changes that were caused by the three different conditions seawater air and pure water abdulla et al 2010 according to the previously described noda s rules asynchronous correlation spectra can reveal the sequential order of specific chemical reactions during the ageing process of ps particles asynchronous maps were anti symmetric in regard to the diagonal thus revealing no auto peak as shown in fig 3 b d and f there were significant differences in the cross peak symbols for the three different conditions in table 1 a positive signal was shown for many cross peaks ψ x1 1666 indicating that the peak intensity that increased at 1666 cm 1 occurred after the other peaks at 1050 1375 1453 1493 and 1601 cm 1 in addition when a cross peak occurs as a negative peak cross peak it means that the peak occurs prior to other peaks for example in seawater negative peaks were observed at ψ 1050 1601 and ψ 1375 1601 implying that the spectral line at 1601 cm 1 occurred prior to the peaks at 1050 and 1375 cm 1 but after the peaks at 1453 and 1493 cm 1 the peak at ψ 1050 1375 1493 showed a negative sign indicating that the peak at 1493 cm 1 occurred earlier than the peak at 1050 and 1375 cm 1 while the peak at 1493 cm 1 occurred later than the peak at 1453 cm 1 in summary the ageing process of ps particles in seawater is as follows 1453 c h 1493 c h 1601 cc 1375 c oh 1050 c o 1666 co scheme s1 similarly based on the result of 2d cos map results for the air aged ps particles the sequential order in which the band changed could be derived 1601 cc 1050 c o 1453 c h 1493 c h 1375 c oh 1666 co scheme s2 the first occurrence of the functional group in the ps ageing process was cc on the benzene ring followed by c h on the benzene ring reactions between polymer macro radicals with oxygen occurred which was when polymer peroxy radicals coo were formed yousif and haddad 2013 and then the oxygen containing bonds was gradually formed which consisted of c oh c o and carbonyl band co in the process of pure water ageing the order of the band was confirmed 1601 cc 1375 c oh 1493 c h 1453 c h 1050 c o 1666 co scheme s3 in particular the c oh on the benzene ring occurred after the cc cleavage of the benzene ring before other bonds were formed therefore the result of such formation may be that the free radicals on the surface of the ps plastic are in oxygen and water respectively and oxygen and h2o reacted with the free radicals of ps to form oxygen containing groups liu et al 2019 yousif and haddad 2013 after an analysis of the 2d cos maps a basic understanding of the mechanism of ps particle ageing was obtained but did not fully explain the mechanism of ageing ps particles these ageing mechanisms could be further verified by xps spectra to clearly present the ageing degree of ps particles xps regional spectra of pristine and aged ps were used to analyze the changes in oxygen containing groups during ageing fig 4 as shown in fig 4 c in the process of pure water ageing the first step was that the cc on the benzene ring was attacked by the unstable oh in the water then the vibration of the c h was affected and the oxygen containing group was correspondingly generated with increasing ageing time the proportion of c o oh increased fig 4c in addition the oxygen to carbon o c atom ratio was calculated table 2 the o c ratio was an alternative parameter to the carbonyl index ci to quantitatively describe the surface alteration properties of microplastics and is significantly correlated with the polymer types liu et al 2019 the xps data showed that the intensity of o c increased with ageing time table 2 for example as the ageing time increased the increase in the oxygen proportion further confirmed the increase in oxygen containing groups in particular the o c ratio increased significantly with the ageing time after pure water ageing and c o and carbonyl band co increased in the high temperature pure water ageing after three months this was basically consistent with the results of previous studies on the artificial ageing of mps liu et al 2019 in pure water the initial degradation of cc on the benzene ring might accelerate the increase is ps particle sizes scheme s3 meanwhile the hydroxylation of the aromatic rings of ps was completed by oh radicals before the formation of phenols and affected the asymmetric stretching vibration of the c h of ps at 1453 1493 cm 1 as expected c c was attacked by h radicals from water and the generation of carbonyl band co occurred meanwhile the xps data verified the ageing process of ps particles fig 4 and table 2 3 4 characteristics and mechanisms of the interaction between the aged ps particles and organic pollutants to more quantitatively understand the influence of the interaction between ps particles and organic pollutants we selected 6 organic pollutants with different physical and chemical properties and studied the adsorption characteristics of organic pollutants by pristine and aged ps particles fig 5 a shows that the adsorption isotherms of 6 organic pollutants on pristine ps particles it could be seen from the isotherm that different organic pollutants have different adsorption characteristics we performed isotherm models to fit the adsorption data this result showed that the adsorption data could be better fitted with henry model than with the other two models table s2 for the pristine ps particles among these models the observed data fit the henry isotherm model well r 2 0 987 with a high correlation coefficient table s2 indicating that adsorption was carried out on the uniform surface by monolayer adsorption razanajatovo et al 2018 additionally the order of adsorption of ps on organic pollutants was as follows pyr phe nap and tyl ety smt which was consistent with the order of logk ow values this result indicated that pollutants with high logk ow values showed high affinities to ps particles the linear relationship provided evidence that the hydrophobicity of the contaminant itself had a significant effect on the adsorption capacity of ps particles fig 5b the hydrophobicity of organic pollutants had previously been documented to increase their adsorption which potentially promoted the interactions between mps and organic contaminants molecules guo et al 2012 liu et al 2018 2019 fig 6 shows that the adsorption isotherms of 6 organic pollutants on pristine air aged pure water aged and seawater aged ps particles we use freundlich model to fit the adsorption data table s3 in table s3 the value of n decreases with the increase of ageing degree which indicates that the nonlinearity of adsorption of organic pollutants by ps particles increases with the increase of ageing degree guo et al 2018 it could be seen from the adsorption capacities of the ps particles followed the order of pristine ps pure water aged ps seawater aged ps air aged ps fig 6 for example in fig 6 b the adsorption capacities of air aged ps particles were higher than other aged ps and pristine ps in both cases the aged ps particles in particular air aged ps had much higher surface oxygen contents due to the introduction of surface o functional groups than the pristine one table 2 in addition an interesting observation was that the relative adsorption capacities of the four ps particles correlated well with their degree of hydrophobicity as indicated by the water contact angles table s4 to understand if the enhanced adsorption capacities of the aged ps were related to their greater hydrophilicity we calculated the water contact angles table s4 and fig s2 the water contact angles were consistent with the observed relative adsorption capacities among the four ps particles fig 6 note that ageing appeared to also increase the ageing ps adsorption to organic pollutants further understanding the significant effects of ageing time on the adsorption capacity of plastics the sorption isotherms of 6 organic pollutants on air aged ps particles are shown in fig 7 the adsorption capacities of ps particles were significantly enhanced as the degree of ageing increased the possible explanation for the high adsorption capacities of aged ps was that the specific surface area increased with increasing ageing time table s5 lists the estimated parameters of the isotherms for aged ps particles the henry model agreed better than the other models r 2 0 988 however the degree of increase in the adsorption of all pollutants by age ps particles was inconsistent thus we selected two types of pollutants one was antibiotic ionic pollutants and the other was polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants when o functional groups were introduced on the aged ps particles a much more significant enhancement in the adsorption affinity for antibiotic contaminants than for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants was observed which could make the antibiotic compounds adsorb to the surface of the ps particles more firmly due to enhanced hydrogen bonding liu et al 2018 zhichong et al 2014 notably the high adsorption capacity of aged ps indicated that hydrophobicity was an important factor affecting its adsorption interestingly aged mps showed little adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the adsorption isotherms nearly overlapped fig 7d f the rather small differences in the adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds which was in agreement with the reported studies about mps were probably due to the combined effects of the ps particles decrease in surface hydrophobicity dong et al 2018 hueffer et al 2018 table s4 and fig s2 showed that the water contact angle of microplastics decreases with ageing time increase the calculated water contact angles table s4 and fig s2 were consistent with the observed results fig 7 4 conclusion a clear understanding of the ageing degree of mps when accelerated by air pure water and seawater at 75 c was investigated to improve the understanding of their long term ageing behaviors in natural environments in our work a 2d ftir cos analysis was used to determine the reaction sequence of the functional groups with the aged ps particles under the three different conditions our results were different from previous studies in which more detail for the ageing mechanism of ps particles was displayed such as the initial degradation of cc on the benzene ring and the generation of carbonyl band co after air ageing moreover we further revealed the influence of the interaction between mps and organic pollutants for pristine ps particles the adsorption effect toward three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contaminants was much greater than toward antibiotics and hydrophobicity was a major factor for adsorption additionally the adsorption capacities of ps particles were significantly enhanced as the degree of ageing increased the increase in specific surface area and oxygen containing surface groups was highly responsible for the highest increase however aged mps demonstrated little adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons because the presence of oxygen containing surface groups on aged ps plastics might form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules these findings clearly demonstrate that the environmental ageing process of mps and their environmental behavior of co existing pollutants in the future we will focus on the environmental behavior and ageing process of different mps under different conditions declaration of competing

ageing experiment all experiments began in april 2018 artificial ageing was carried out in the laboratory over three months the ps samples were exposed to three environments air 75 c seawater 75 c or freshwater 75 c two grams of ps were weighed into quartz glass petri dishes and then covered with quartz glass lids seawater and pure water were added to each of the dishes which was adjusted to ph 7 0 in the 75 c air group only ps particles were added to the petri dish the three mp samples were placed in a thermostat controlled device which maintained the temperature at 75 c the ps samples were removed for different time periods 1 month 2 months and 3 months then the aged samples were washed several times with ultrapure water filtered and dried before further characterization and sorption analysis it is worth noting that the ageing time ranged from 1 month to 3 months during which the seawater and pure water was regularly replenished to ensure that the ps samples were covered the chemical composition of seawater table s1 and seawater replenishment were artificially simulated 2 3 characteristic analysis of aged mps the ftir vetex70 bruker germany was chosen to identify surface groups on the mps and to observe the changes in functional groups of the mps after artificial ageing while scanning electron microscopy sem nova nano sem 450 fei was applied to observe the surface morphology the ftir spectra were recorded in the 4000 400 cm 1 region with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and 64 scanning times the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was performed to scan the aged mps the scanned aged mps shown that the carbon and oxygen in the uppermost surface layer of the pellets changed during the ageing process additionally the change in crystallinity between the pristine and aged mps were detected using x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany the contact angles of the aged ps were measured using an oca 20 contact angle system dataphysics instruments gmbh germany at room temperature in this work the ageing time was defined as an external disturbance of ps causing a change in ps functional groups during the ageing test based on the work of noda and ozaki dowrey et al 2001 lasch and noda 2019 noda 2006 information on the composition and changed functional groups was obtained ftir spectra integrated with 2d cos were applied using the observed changes in the aged ps particles more detailed information on 2d cos has been described by noda and ozaki and can be found elsewhere lasch and noda 2019 detail in supporting information si 2 4 adsorption test a sorption isotherm is vital for designing a sorption system thus polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and antibiotic adsorption experiments were conducted with different concentrations first each 20 ml brown glass bottle received the same mass of ps plastics 0 025 g then different concentrations of tyl solutions smt solutions sty solutions nap solutions phe solutions and pyr solutions were transferred to plastics bottles containing ps all the samples were placed in thermostatic oscillator at 25 c and oscillated at 150 rpm for 48 h after sorption the solution was filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane filter in a glass bottle to measure the concentration of contaminants each group also had a parallel sample as a reference koh and hno3 were used to adjust the ph of the solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of aged ps particles as demonstrated in fig 1 a the pristine ps particles surfaces were observed to be relatively smooth with spherical shapes the morphology of the ps particles displayed nicked shapes and slight cracking phenomena after 1 month after 3 months the aged ps particles appeared to have much rougher surfaces and multiple cracks along with the formation of rugged textures in addition debris was found on the surface of ps particles aged for 3 months which can be ascribed to the embrittlement and fragmentation of materials horton et al 2017 overall the shape shrunk cracks and pits gradually formed on the surface of the mps as ageing proceeded moreover the ps plastics had different changes at different ageing times and under different ageing conditions fig 1b e the ps particles began to appear some debris after 1 month and debris may be caused by the breakage of mps and a shrunken shape shrinks appeared after 3 months of the air ageing treatment whereas the ps plastics exhibited a slight cracking phenomenon after 1 month and debris was appeared after 3 months of the seawater ageing treatment additionally the morphological features of pure water aged ps did not obviously differ from those of pristine ps fig 1f g in comparison the structural changes on the surfaces of the air aged ps particles were more observable than those in seawater aged and pure water aged ps particles which suggests that ageing in air has a relatively stronger effect to further analyze the structure of aged ps particles under different ageing conditions we performed an xrd analysis of all the composites as shown in fig s1 a low crystallinity was observed for the air aged ps particles these results are similar to those of aged ps particles in sem images 3 2 ftir spectra analysis to further clarify the various characteristics and mechanisms under different ageing conditions ftir spectra was performed to analyze the structure and functional groups of the ps particles as shown in fig 2 the major peaks were concentrated in the regions of 4000 400 cm 1 the characteristic bands at 1050 1375 1453 1493 1601 1666 and 3430 cm 1 displayed strong intensities in the ftir spectra of ps particles peaks of the carbonyl band co stretching vibration and c oh tensile characteristics were observed at 1666 and 1375 cm 1 respectively banks at 1453 and 1493 cm 1 corresponded to the cyclic c h structure of ps particles at 1601 cm 1 caused by cc vibration of aromatic rings were observed and the ir peak at 1050 cm 1was due to the presence of an o c o structure in addition the ftir spectra also indicated that the functional groups change of the ps particles were significantly affected by time the peak intensity increased with increasing ageing time such as the region of 1800 to 1000 cm 1 especially the two small peaks at 1453 and 1493 cm 1 involving in the cyclic c h structures of ps increased at different conditions with increasing ageing time further indicating that the characteristic structures involving in benzene ring of ps were destructed fa et al 2013 lucas and porter 1988 yang et al 2011 moreover the formation of a new peak at 1050 cm 1 was found with the air aged ps particles representing the formation of o c o similarly the peak of o c o was also found with the pure water aged and seawater aged ps particles but the peak for the pure water aged and seawater aged ps particles was much weaker indicating that the formed o c o could be degraded in seawater and pure water brandon et al 2016 additionally the peak of the carbonyl band co increased with the air aged seawater aged and pure water aged samples with increasing ageing time possible reason is that the carbonyl compound could be final product liu et al 2019 however there was a slight increase in the peak intensities of the functional groups between the original and seawater aged ps particles in the ftir these results indicate that the ageing mechanisms of ps particles largely depend on the different ageing conditions celina 2013 yousif and haddad 2013 3 3 2d cos maps on the ageing process of ps particles to further explain the sequence of the various functional group changes and the mechanisms for the aged ps plastics during the ageing process we performed 2d cos analysis based on the one dimensional ftir spectral data and the results are shown in fig 3 the synchronous maps under the three conditions were different in the distribution of peaks six auto peaks were observed at 1050 1375 1453 1493 1601 and 1666 cm 1 along the diagonal line ageing ps had undergone different changes under three different ageing conditions regardless of the different conditions peaks at 1453 1492 and 1601 cm 1 c h and cc on the benzene ring respectively had the highest intensity which may be due to the opening of phenyl rings or the volatilization of small molecules containing phenyl rings from the ps backbone fa et al 2013 lucas and porter 1988 yang et al 2011 in addition the auto peaks for air and seawater ageing had the higher intensities than those with pure water fig 3a c and e moreover positive signs were observed for the three different three conditions of cross peaks in the synchronous maps table 1 indicating that almost all the cross peaks were synchronized during the ageing process among them when ps particles were aged by air the positive sign of all cross peaks φ x 1 1666 0 indicated that the transformation direction of peak at the 1666 cm 1 was similar to the other peaks owing to the increasing intensity of the peak at 1666 cm 1 with increasing ageing time obviously the above findings provide direct evidence on the generation of carbonyl band co in general compared with the general ftir spectrum the synchronous maps of 2d cos analysis can provide deeper insights into the functional groups changes that were caused by the three different conditions seawater air and pure water abdulla et al 2010 according to the previously described noda s rules asynchronous correlation spectra can reveal the sequential order of specific chemical reactions during the ageing process of ps particles asynchronous maps were anti symmetric in regard to the diagonal thus revealing no auto peak as shown in fig 3 b d and f there were significant differences in the cross peak symbols for the three different conditions in table 1 a positive signal was shown for many cross peaks ψ x1 1666 indicating that the peak intensity that increased at 1666 cm 1 occurred after the other peaks at 1050 1375 1453 1493 and 1601 cm 1 in addition when a cross peak occurs as a negative peak cross peak it means that the peak occurs prior to other peaks for example in seawater negative peaks were observed at ψ 1050 1601 and ψ 1375 1601 implying that the spectral line at 1601 cm 1 occurred prior to the peaks at 1050 and 1375 cm 1 but after the peaks at 1453 and 1493 cm 1 the peak at ψ 1050 1375 1493 showed a negative sign indicating that the peak at 1493 cm 1 occurred earlier than the peak at 1050 and 1375 cm 1 while the peak at 1493 cm 1 occurred later than the peak at 1453 cm 1 in summary the ageing process of ps particles in seawater is as follows 1453 c h 1493 c h 1601 cc 1375 c oh 1050 c o 1666 co scheme s1 similarly based on the result of 2d cos map results for the air aged ps particles the sequential order in which the band changed could be derived 1601 cc 1050 c o 1453 c h 1493 c h 1375 c oh 1666 co scheme s2 the first occurrence of the functional group in the ps ageing process was cc on the benzene ring followed by c h on the benzene ring reactions between polymer macro radicals with oxygen occurred which was when polymer peroxy radicals coo were formed yousif and haddad 2013 and then the oxygen containing bonds was gradually formed which consisted of c oh c o and carbonyl band co in the process of pure water ageing the order of the band was confirmed 1601 cc 1375 c oh 1493 c h 1453 c h 1050 c o 1666 co scheme s3 in particular the c oh on the benzene ring occurred after the cc cleavage of the benzene ring before other bonds were formed therefore the result of such formation may be that the free radicals on the surface of the ps plastic are in oxygen and water respectively and oxygen and h2o reacted with the free radicals of ps to form oxygen containing groups liu et al 2019 yousif and haddad 2013 after an analysis of the 2d cos maps a basic understanding of the mechanism of ps particle ageing was obtained but did not fully explain the mechanism of ageing ps particles these ageing mechanisms could be further verified by xps spectra to clearly present the ageing degree of ps particles xps regional spectra of pristine and aged ps were used to analyze the changes in oxygen containing groups during ageing fig 4 as shown in fig 4 c in the process of pure water ageing the first step was that the cc on the benzene ring was attacked by the unstable oh in the water then the vibration of the c h was affected and the oxygen containing group was correspondingly generated with increasing ageing time the proportion of c o oh increased fig 4c in addition the oxygen to carbon o c atom ratio was calculated table 2 the o c ratio was an alternative parameter to the carbonyl index ci to quantitatively describe the surface alteration properties of microplastics and is significantly correlated with the polymer types liu et al 2019 the xps data showed that the intensity of o c increased with ageing time table 2 for example as the ageing time increased the increase in the oxygen proportion further confirmed the increase in oxygen containing groups in particular the o c ratio increased significantly with the ageing time after pure water ageing and c o and carbonyl band co increased in the high temperature pure water ageing after three months this was basically consistent with the results of previous studies on the artificial ageing of mps liu et al 2019 in pure water the initial degradation of cc on the benzene ring might accelerate the increase is ps particle sizes scheme s3 meanwhile the hydroxylation of the aromatic rings of ps was completed by oh radicals before the formation of phenols and affected the asymmetric stretching vibration of the c h of ps at 1453 1493 cm 1 as expected c c was attacked by h radicals from water and the generation of carbonyl band co occurred meanwhile the xps data verified the ageing process of ps particles fig 4 and table 2 3 4 characteristics and mechanisms of the interaction between the aged ps particles and organic pollutants to more quantitatively understand the influence of the interaction between ps particles and organic pollutants we selected 6 organic pollutants with different physical and chemical properties and studied the adsorption characteristics of organic pollutants by pristine and aged ps particles fig 5 a shows that the adsorption isotherms of 6 organic pollutants on pristine ps particles it could be seen from the isotherm that different organic pollutants have different adsorption characteristics we performed isotherm models to fit the adsorption data this result showed that the adsorption data could be better fitted with henry model than with the other two models table s2 for the pristine ps particles among these models the observed data fit the henry isotherm model well r 2 0 987 with a high correlation coefficient table s2 indicating that adsorption was carried out on the uniform surface by monolayer adsorption razanajatovo et al 2018 additionally the order of adsorption of ps on organic pollutants was as follows pyr phe nap and tyl ety smt which was consistent with the order of logk ow values this result indicated that pollutants with high logk ow values showed high affinities to ps particles the linear relationship provided evidence that the hydrophobicity of the contaminant itself had a significant effect on the adsorption capacity of ps particles fig 5b the hydrophobicity of organic pollutants had previously been documented to increase their adsorption which potentially promoted the interactions between mps and organic contaminants molecules guo et al 2012 liu et al 2018 2019 fig 6 shows that the adsorption isotherms of 6 organic pollutants on pristine air aged pure water aged and seawater aged ps particles we use freundlich model to fit the adsorption data table s3 in table s3 the value of n decreases with the increase of ageing degree which indicates that the nonlinearity of adsorption of organic pollutants by ps particles increases with the increase of ageing degree guo et al 2018 it could be seen from the adsorption capacities of the ps particles followed the order of pristine ps pure water aged ps seawater aged ps air aged ps fig 6 for example in fig 6 b the adsorption capacities of air aged ps particles were higher than other aged ps and pristine ps in both cases the aged ps particles in particular air aged ps had much higher surface oxygen contents due to the introduction of surface o functional groups than the pristine one table 2 in addition an interesting observation was that the relative adsorption capacities of the four ps particles correlated well with their degree of hydrophobicity as indicated by the water contact angles table s4 to understand if the enhanced adsorption capacities of the aged ps were related to their greater hydrophilicity we calculated the water contact angles table s4 and fig s2 the water contact angles were consistent with the observed relative adsorption capacities among the four ps particles fig 6 note that ageing appeared to also increase the ageing ps adsorption to organic pollutants further understanding the significant effects of ageing time on the adsorption capacity of plastics the sorption isotherms of 6 organic pollutants on air aged ps particles are shown in fig 7 the adsorption capacities of ps particles were significantly enhanced as the degree of ageing increased the possible explanation for the high adsorption capacities of aged ps was that the specific surface area increased with increasing ageing time table s5 lists the estimated parameters of the isotherms for aged ps particles the henry model agreed better than the other models r 2 0 988 however the degree of increase in the adsorption of all pollutants by age ps particles was inconsistent thus we selected two types of pollutants one was antibiotic ionic pollutants and the other was polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants when o functional groups were introduced on the aged ps particles a much more significant enhancement in the adsorption affinity for antibiotic contaminants than for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants was observed which could make the antibiotic compounds adsorb to the surface of the ps particles more firmly due to enhanced hydrogen bonding liu et al 2018 zhichong et al 2014 notably the high adsorption capacity of aged ps indicated that hydrophobicity was an important factor affecting its adsorption interestingly aged mps showed little adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the adsorption isotherms nearly overlapped fig 7d f the rather small differences in the adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds which was in agreement with the reported studies about mps were probably due to the combined effects of the ps particles decrease in surface hydrophobicity dong et al 2018 hueffer et al 2018 table s4 and fig s2 showed that the water contact angle of microplastics decreases with ageing time increase the calculated water contact angles table s4 and fig s2 were consistent with the observed results fig 7 4 conclusion a clear understanding of the ageing degree of mps when accelerated by air pure water and seawater at 75 c was investigated to improve the understanding of their long term ageing behaviors in natural environments in our work a 2d ftir cos analysis was used to determine the reaction sequence of the functional groups with the aged ps particles under the three different conditions our results were different from previous studies in which more detail for the ageing mechanism of ps particles was displayed such as the initial degradation of cc on the benzene ring and the generation of carbonyl band co after air ageing moreover we further revealed the influence of the interaction between mps and organic pollutants for pristine ps particles the adsorption effect toward three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contaminants was much greater than toward antibiotics and hydrophobicity was a major factor for adsorption additionally the adsorption capacities of ps particles were significantly enhanced as the degree of ageing increased the increase in specific surface area and oxygen containing surface groups was highly responsible for the highest increase however aged mps demonstrated little adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons because the presence of oxygen containing surface groups on aged ps plastics might form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules these findings clearly demonstrate that the environmental ageing process of mps and their environmental behavior of co existing pollutants in the future we will focus on the environmental behavior and ageing process of different mps under different conditions declaration of competing

structural fe iii can accept electrons from lmwts through proton coupled transfer from sh functional group which was supported by ftir xrd and mössbauer spectroscopies the results of dft calculations suggested that clay surfaces could accelerate rs formation and stabilize the radicals the addition of na nau 2 in the cystein solution could increase as iii oxidation to as v from 16 3 to 42 0 the

significant increasing in k obs lmwts by 3 7 2 2 and 2 5 times for cys gsh and hcy and c 96 h oh by 6 6 2 4 7 8 and 3 7 times for ca cys gsh and hcy respectively table 2 indicating the interactions between iron bearing clay minerals and lmwts could remarkably facilitate oh formation due to the highest oh formation from cys oxidation with and without clay particles among others cys was chosen to investigate the mechanisms between iron bearing clay minerals and lmwts on oh production consistently the addition of iron bearing clay minerals increased free radical signals in epr spectra of the cys solution fig 1b there was a positive linear correlation r 2 0 98 between k oh values and na nau 2 concentrations 4 g l 1 clay concentrations fig a3 which suggested that clay particles catalyzed the oxidation of cys and promoted free radical generations different clay minerals exhibited different catalytic activities as shown in fig 2 a the addition of na nau 1 or na nau 2 significantly improved the cumulative oh concentrations c 96 h oh after 96 h incubation 214 9 0 7 μm or 312 5 3 2 μμ respectively however na saz 2 had limited effect on oh formation c 96 h oh 19 2 0 6 μm although c 96 h oh in the cys na nau 1 system was only 69 of that in the cys na nau 2 system the k oh in the cys na nau 1 system 6 5 μm h 1 was 1 6 times faster than that of the cys na nau 2 system furthermore the f fe ii value was increasing as the reaction proceeded in the cys clay suspension fig 2b because structural fe in clay particles participated in the electron transfer process the fe contents locations and configurations could influence oh production gorski et al 2013 3 3 structural fe configuration effects on oh formation most of the structural fe iii atoms were located in the octahedral layers octfe iii in na nau 1 na nau 2 clay particles table a1 the interactions between cys and octfe iii were hypothesized to be related to electron transfers from the tetrahedral surface to octahedral sites through ditrigonal cavities morrison et al 2013 because cys could intercalate into clay interlayers fig a4a the chemical changes of octahedral domains during the reaction can be evaluated by the xrd pattern of clay powders as illustrated in fig a4b there was only a broad peak at 61 62 in the spectrum of pristine na nau 2 which is a typical pattern of dioctahedral clay minerals moore and reynolds 1997 the broad peak slightly decreased and a new weak peak at 59 60 appeared in the xrd spectrum after na nau 2 reacting with cys indicating that some fe iii in dioctahedral domains could migrate to vacancy sites and form trioctahedral clusters during the structural fe reduction ftir spectra further confirmed the changes of structral fe after interaction with cys fig a5 the peaks at 818 cm 1 and 3553 cm 1 in the ftir spectrum were assigned to the bending and stretching vibration of fe iii fe iii oh in the pristine clay minerals morrison et al 2013 yuan et al 2018 and the peak of 869 cm 1 might be attributed to al fe iii oh bending vibration the peaks at 818 cm 1 and 3553 cm 1 were blue shifted to 845 cm 1 and 3562 cm 1 after reacting with cys for 1 d which were coincident with the bending and stretching vibrations of fe ii fe ii oh neumann et al 2011 and the peak intensities increased significantly after 6 d the mössbauer spectra fig 3 a and b showed there were two fe iii configurations in na nau 1 including 61 1 cis octfe iii and 38 9 goethite fe iii goefe iii table a2 which were consistent with the previous study of jaisi et al 2005 varied clay pretreatment methods of clay might cause the different fe contents and configurations of the same clay mineral in different literatures after incubated with cys the content of cis octfe iii and goefe iii changed to 62 1 and 37 9 thus it is reasonable to propose that goefe iii in na nau 1 had higher reactivity than cis octfe iii in accepting electrons due to its thermodynamically instability berner 1969 there were 81 5 of cis octfe iii and 18 5 of trans distorted cis octfe iii in na nau 2 table a2 which was comparable with the reported values gorski et al 2012 jaisi et al 2005 schaefer et al 2011 the signals of tetfe iii were relatively low in na nau 2 in this study possibly due to the chemical inhomogeneity of clay minerals gorski et al 2012 schaefer et al 2011 no goefe iii was detected in na nau 2 in this study fig 3c which could explain why na nau 2 had slower k oh than na nau 1 as illustrated in fig 3d the peak area of cis octfe iii did not change significantly but trans distorted cis octfe iii peaks decreased and new peaks 10 of trans distorted cis octfe ii were detected after interacting with cys for 48 h table a2 these results directly indicated that trans distorted cis octfe iii had higher activity in accepting electrons than cis octfe iii in accepting electrons jaisi et al 2007 3 4 influence of initial ph and do on oh formation increasing ph from 4 6 to 5 7 enhanced c 96 h oh from 293 0 3 8 μm to 339 7 3 3 μm however continuous increase in ph could inhibit oh formation fig 4 a this result was consistent with the results of zhang and yuan 2017 solution ph can change the speciation distribution of cys due to the ionizable functional groups sh nh2 and cooh table 1 fig a6 the major species of cys or hcy at ph 5 7 were neutral zwitterions cys 99 76 or hcy 99 90 the major species of ca at ph 5 7 were cations ca 99 78 and for gsh were one negative charged gsh 99 14 thus sh protonated species were the major species to be oxidized further statistical analysis showed that c 96 h oh of cys had linear regression with the fractions of cys r 2 0 83 p 0 05 this result was also supported by the observations that the f fe ii in reacted clay particles after 96 h was higher at lower ph than that at higher ph fig 4b similar results have been reported that less fe ii was formed in solution as ph increasing in the presence of hydroquinon jiang et al 2015 and humic acid chen et al 2003 which followed the similar mechanism that the reactivity of ionizable compound with iron bearing clay minerals was controlled by its ph dependent speciation distribution the self oxidation of cys was accelerated as ph increased as shown in fig 4a which was in line with the previous studies of chu et al 2017 eitel and taillefert 2017 and morrison et al 2013 as displayed in table 3 c 96 h oh was only 9 3 0 9 μm in the cys na nau 2 system in oxygen limited condition do concentration 0 016 mm while the group with air purging 0 26 mm at 25 c had higher c 96 h oh 292 0 8 3 μm which indicated that oxygen is an important factor in oh formation however the value of c 96 h oh 99 8 11 4 μm in the reaction system with oxygen purging was about one third of that under air purging although the k oh value with o2 purging was twice larger than that with air purging the hypothesis was that over saturated do could re oxidize structual fe ii to fe iii fig a7 table 3 which decreased the oh production in fenton like reactions 3 5 free radicals quenching experiments quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the dominate reaction pathways in the cys na nau 2 system table 4 the addition of ethanol could inhibit 97 of p hba formation which confirmed the formation of oh adding bpy could inhibit 99 of oh formation in the cys na nau 2 system because the concentration of dissolved fe2 was negligible 3 μm during 96 h incubation fig a8 it was reasonable to extrapolate that most of the reactions happened at structural fe sites on clay surfaces especially at clay broken edges and basel planes the quenching experiments with 500 mg l 1 cat showed 8 8 of oh formation was inhibited but k oh increased suggesting that most of oh might not be formed from h2o2 decomposition the addition of cat could increase do eq 1 which might cause the increase of k oh adding 1 mm nbt decreased c 96 h oh from 245 1 mm to 199 0 mμ suggesting oh was partially produced from o 2 dismutation wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 based on the discussion above we have proposed the interactions between cys and na nau 2 the zwitterion cys could be adsorbed to na nau 2 particles through nh3 due to electronstatic forces the electron process would prefer to happen between sh functional group and goefe iii sites or trans dist cis octfe iii sites and produce fe ii rs eq 11 followed by rs desorption eq 12 eitel and taillefert 2017 the reduced structural fe ii could partially react with adsorbed o2 to form surface bounded fe iii o 2 and surface bound h2o2 eq 13 and 14 then oh was formed through heterogeneous fenton like reactions eq 15 most of fe ii rs could react with do to form intermediate surface bound fe ii rsoo eq 16 clay surfaces act as catalyst to accelerate the dissociation of surface bound rsoo to form oh eq 17 11 fe iii rsh fe ii rs h 12 fe ii rs o 2 fe ii rsoo 13 fe ii o 2 fe iii o 2 14 fe iii o 2 2 h fe iii h 2 o 2 15 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh oh 16 fe ii rs o2 fe ii rsoo 17 fe ii rsoo h fe iii rso oh 3 6 dft calculation and proposed mechanisms dft calculation was performed to unravel the reaction mechanisms of different lmwts in the absence and presence of nontronite surface to induce the formation oh or rs the optimized structures of lmwts in the absence of nontronite were shown in fig a9a the reactivity of lmwts with o2 is related to their ionization potentials p i liu et al 2011 the p i value of lmwts was ranged from 3 75 to 4 20 ev table 5 suggesting that the initial formation of rs would be relatively difficult it was consistent with the observed low k obs lmwts table 2 however once rs was formed it was relatively easy to produce ros species in the presence of do the subsequent interactions between lmwts and o2 were confirmed to be energetically favorable to produce more rs and to initiate the radical chain reactions cardey et al 2007 in this study o2 was experimentally observed in the both autoxidation and lmwts na nau 2 systems the reactions between lmwts and o2 were further calculated fig a9b and a9c the reactions between lmwts and o 2 form intermediate rsh o2 complexes first then one electron transfers from o2 to s atom coupled with h transferring to o2 to produce rs containing transition state ts which would further split into rs and ooh based on the reaction free energy profiles fig a10 it is energetically favorable for all lmwts especially gsh 33 74 kcal mol 1 to form the intermediate complexes with o2 the reaction energies were 9 91 12 72 kcal mol 1 for other lmwts with moderate reaction barriers ranged from 11 8 to 17 9 kcal mol 1 it was consistent with experimental observations that the k obs gsh was higher than other lmwts in the absence of na nau 2 table 2 the complexes of hcy and ca with o2 were slightly less stable and induced higher activation barrier to produce rs which might be the reason for the observed lower k obs lmwts for hcy and ca autoxidation the rate limiting step for lmwts autoxidation was the initial formation of rs as suggested by above discussion therefore we proposed that fe bearing smectite clay could act as a catalyst in electron transfer process from lmwts to the structural fe iii and stabilize formed surface bound fe ii rs to initiate the radical chain reactions eq 11 17 further dft calculations of lmwts interacting with the surface of fe bearing smectite were conducted based on previous studies decornez and hammes schiffer 1999 ghosh et al 2017 soudackov and hammes schiffer 1999 the h coupled electron transfer was considered as the plausible pathway for reactions between lmwts and fe bearing clay in which an electron was transferred from thiol group to structural fe iii coupled with the proton in s h transferred to the o in siloxane surface or the fe al bridging o through ditrigonal cativity after the interaction spin densities of structural fe changed from 4 35 to 3 74 and s from 0 0 to 0 38 0 52 respectively confirming the occurrence of electron transfer table 5 the calculated reaction energies e i for lmwts in the presence of fe bearing clay were significantly reduced by 2 ev as compared to their p i values except 0 2 ev for hcy table 5 the reaction energies were still slightly positive to produce the initial rs which might be due to the low fe iii content and lack of fe clustering in the simplified nontronite model supercell experimental evidence suggested that structural fe clusters were more reactive than isolated fe iii which would further reduce the energy barrier for rs formation moreover the order of the calculated e i values were well consistent with the sequence of observed c 96 h oh in the lmwts nontronite system altogether the dft calculations support that fe bearing clay act as a catalyst initially oxidizing lmwts and stabilizing the resultant rs to facilitate the chain reaction and produce oh 3 7 as iii transformation in the cys na nau 2 systems the reactivity of oh produced during the reaction between lwmts and nontronite towards the degradation of environmental contaminants was testifed by using as iii as the model contaminant the presence of cys in solution decreased inorganic as iii by 37 1 in which 16 3 was converted to inorganic as v due to oh attack grafe et al 2001 and 20 8 might be converted to organic as complex based on the total inorganic as concentration analysis fig 5 it has been reported that cys can form organic as complex with as iii or as v through amino groups carboxylic groups and thiol groups spuches et al 2005 in the na nau 2 suspension only 10 1 of as iii was adsorbed to clay particles and no significant conversion of as iii to as v fig 5 the addition of cys in the na nau 2 suspension decreased inorganic as iii concentration by 78 8 and the total inorganic as concentration by 36 8 which indicated that 42 0 of inorganic as iii was converted to inorganic as v the more inorganic as v formation was in line with more oh produced than in cys solution it is usually considered that organic as complex is less toxic than inorganic species ramesh et al 2007 therefore the interaction between na nau 2 and cys could contribute as iii detoxification in reaction system further experiments are needed in future to explore the environmental risks of these organic as complexes 4 conclusions this study investigated the interactions between fe bearing smectite minerals and lmwts and the formation of oh in the presence of do lmwts could be oxidized by oxygen to produce oh fe bearing clay minerals could accept electrons from lmwts through proton coupled electron transfer and clay surfaces could stabilize surface bound rs radicals and yield more oh the goefe iii in na nau 1 or tran distorted cis octfe iii sites in na nau 2 can react with lmwts faster than other structural fe sites in fe bearing smectites the structure of lmwts has important effects on the reactions for instance longer backbone chain gsh would destabilize the formed rs radicals it can be significantly stabilized by the interaction with nontronite surface solution ph had a significant influence on oh production by changing the speciation distribution of lmwts acidic condition facilitated the production of oh while the autoxidation of lmwts would be accelerated in alkalic evironment and decreased oh formation the formed oh in the cys na nau 2 system could effectively convert higher toxic inorganic as iii to lower toxic inorganic as v the study provides new insights into possible pathways of oh formation in the presence of fe bearing clay minerals and lmwts which could contribute to the natural attenuation and transformation of contaminants in natural environments declaration of competing interest the

18066,low molecular weight thiols lmwts are widely occurring in waters and soils which can act as electron shuttles in biogeochemical cycles it is interesting to study the interactions between lmwts

conducted with three fe bearing clay minerals na nau 1 na nau 2 and na saz 2 and four lmwts l cysteine cysteamine homocysteine and glutathione to investigate the reaction mechanisms of lmwts with fe

oxidation quenching experiments confirmed surface fenton like reactions were the main pathways of oh formation in the presence of fe bearing smectite clay minerals the most possible hypothesis is that structural fe iii can accept electrons from lmwts through proton coupled transfer from sh functional group which was supported by ftir xrd and mössbauer spectroscopies the results of dft calculations suggested that clay surfaces could accelerate rs formation and stabilize the radicals the addition of na nau 2 in the cystein solution could increase as iii oxidation to as v from 16 3 to 42 0 the

structural fe can accept or donate electrons depending on the valence states in biogeochemical or chemical processes gorski et al 2012 jaisi et al 2007 neumann et al 2013 liu et al 2017 reported microorganisms could reduce structural fe iii in smectite to fe ii and structural fe ii can further induce the production of oh radicals in the presence of h2o2 or oxygen chen et al 2018 the recently

confirmed by density functional theory dft computations in addition to the traditional spectroscopic characterizations kéri et al 2019 clay minerals and lmwts commonly coexist in natural redox dynamic systems such as wetlands and interfaces of dry wet subsurface soils it has been reported that cys and thiourea can intercalate into the interlayer spaces of 2 1 type clays and then reduce adsorbed fe3

zhang et al 2016 the interaction between fe bearing clay minerals and lmwts could have the potential to produce oh which might oxidize as iii and accelerate its immobilization in the redox dynamic

between iron bearing clay minerals and lmwts could remarkably facilitate oh formation due to the highest oh formation from cys oxidation with and without clay particles among others cys was chosen to investigate the mechanisms between iron bearing clay minerals and lmwts on oh production consistently the addition of iron bearing clay minerals increased free radical signals in epr spectra of the cys solution fig 1b there was a positive linear correlation r 2 0 98 between k oh values and na nau 2 concentrations 4 g l 1 clay concentrations fig a3 which suggested that clay particles catalyzed

improved the cumulative oh concentrations c 96 h oh after 96 h incubation 214 9 0 7 μm or 312 5 3 2 μμ respectively however na saz 2 had limited effect on oh formation c 96 h oh 19 2 0 6 μm although c 96 h oh in the cys na nau 1 system was only 69 of that in the cys na nau 2 system the k oh in the cys na nau 1 system 6 5 μm h 1 was 1 6 times faster than that of the cys na nau 2 system furthermore the f fe ii value was increasing as the reaction proceeded in the cys clay suspension fig 2b because structural fe in clay particles participated in the electron transfer process the fe contents locations and configurations could influence oh production gorski et al 2013 3 3 structural fe configuration effects on oh formation most of the structural fe iii atoms were located in the octahedral layers octfe iii in na nau 1 na nau 2 clay particles table a1 the interactions between cys and octfe iii were hypothesized to be related to electron transfers from the tetrahedral surface to octahedral sites through ditrigonal cavities morrison et al 2013 because cys could intercalate into clay interlayers fig a4a the chemical changes of octahedral domains during the reaction can be evaluated by the xrd pattern of clay powders as illustrated in fig a4b there was only a broad peak at 61 62 in the spectrum of pristine na nau 2 which is a typical pattern of dioctahedral clay minerals moore and reynolds 1997 the broad peak slightly decreased and a new weak peak at 59 60 appeared in the xrd spectrum after na nau 2 reacting with cys indicating that some fe iii in dioctahedral domains could migrate to vacancy sites and form trioctahedral clusters during the structural fe reduction ftir spectra further confirmed the changes of structral fe after interaction with cys fig a5 the peaks at 818 cm 1 and 3553 cm 1 in the ftir spectrum were assigned to the bending and stretching vibration of fe iii fe iii oh in the pristine clay minerals morrison et al 2013 yuan et al 2018 and the peak of 869 cm 1 might be attributed to al fe iii oh bending vibration the peaks at 818 cm 1 and 3553 cm 1 were blue shifted to 845 cm 1 and 3562 cm 1 after reacting with cys for 1 d which were coincident with the bending and stretching vibrations of fe ii fe ii oh neumann et al 2011 and the peak intensities increased significantly after 6 d the mössbauer spectra fig 3 a and b showed there were two fe iii configurations in na nau 1 including 61 1 cis octfe iii and 38 9 goethite fe iii goefe iii table a2 which were consistent with the previous study of jaisi et al 2005 varied clay pretreatment methods of clay might cause the different fe contents and configurations of the same clay mineral in different literatures after incubated with cys the content of cis octfe iii and goefe iii changed to 62 1 and 37 9 thus it is reasonable to propose that goefe iii in na nau 1 had higher reactivity than cis octfe iii in accepting electrons due to its thermodynamically instability berner 1969 there were 81 5 of cis octfe iii and 18 5 of trans distorted cis octfe iii in na nau 2 table a2 which was comparable with the reported values gorski et al 2012 jaisi et al 2005 schaefer et al 2011 the signals of tetfe iii were relatively low in na nau 2 in this study possibly due to the chemical inhomogeneity of clay minerals gorski et al 2012 schaefer et al 2011 no goefe iii was detected in na nau 2 in this study fig 3c which could explain why na nau 2 had slower k oh than na nau 1 as illustrated in fig 3d the peak area of cis octfe iii did not change significantly but trans distorted cis octfe iii peaks decreased and new peaks 10 of trans distorted cis octfe ii were detected after interacting with cys for 48 h table a2 these results directly indicated that trans distorted cis octfe iii had higher activity in accepting electrons than cis octfe iii in accepting electrons jaisi et al 2007 3 4 influence of initial ph and do on oh formation increasing ph from 4 6 to 5 7 enhanced c 96 h oh from 293 0 3 8 μm to 339 7 3 3 μm however continuous increase in ph could inhibit oh formation fig 4 a this result was consistent with the results of zhang and yuan 2017 solution ph can change the speciation distribution of cys due to the ionizable functional groups sh nh2 and cooh table 1 fig a6 the major species of cys or hcy at ph 5 7 were neutral zwitterions cys 99 76 or hcy 99 90 the major species of ca at ph 5 7 were cations ca 99 78 and for gsh were one negative charged gsh 99 14 thus sh protonated species were the major species to be oxidized further statistical analysis showed that c 96 h oh of cys had linear regression with the fractions of cys r 2 0 83 p 0 05 this result was also supported by the observations that the f fe ii in reacted clay particles after 96 h was higher at lower ph than that at higher ph fig 4b similar results have been reported that less fe ii was formed in solution as ph increasing in the presence of hydroquinon jiang et al 2015 and humic acid chen et al 2003 which followed the similar mechanism that the reactivity of ionizable compound with iron bearing clay minerals was controlled by its ph dependent speciation distribution the self oxidation of cys was accelerated as ph increased as shown in fig 4a which was in line with the previous studies of chu et al 2017 eitel and taillefert 2017 and morrison et al 2013 as displayed in table 3 c 96 h oh was only 9 3 0 9 μm in the cys na nau 2 system in oxygen limited condition do concentration 0 016 mm while the group with air purging 0 26 mm at 25 c had higher c 96 h oh 292 0 8 3 μm which indicated that oxygen is an important factor in oh formation however the value of c 96 h oh 99 8 11 4 μm in the reaction system with oxygen purging was about one third of that under air purging although the k oh value with o2 purging was twice larger than that with air purging the hypothesis was that over saturated do could re oxidize structual fe ii to fe iii fig a7 table 3 which decreased the oh production in fenton like reactions 3 5 free radicals quenching experiments quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the dominate reaction pathways in the cys na nau 2 system table 4 the addition of ethanol could inhibit 97 of p hba formation which confirmed the formation of oh adding bpy could inhibit 99 of oh formation in the cys na nau 2 system because the concentration of dissolved fe2 was negligible 3 μm during 96 h incubation fig a8 it was reasonable to extrapolate that most of the reactions happened at structural fe sites on clay surfaces especially at clay broken edges and basel planes the quenching experiments with 500 mg l 1 cat showed 8 8 of oh formation was inhibited but k oh increased suggesting that most of oh might not be formed from h2o2 decomposition the addition of cat could increase do eq 1 which might cause the increase of k oh adding 1 mm nbt decreased c 96 h oh from 245 1 mm to 199 0 mμ suggesting oh was partially produced from o 2 dismutation wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 based on the discussion above we have proposed the interactions between cys and na nau 2 the zwitterion cys could be adsorbed to na nau 2 particles through nh3 due to electronstatic forces the electron process would prefer to happen between sh functional group and goefe iii sites or trans dist cis octfe iii sites and produce fe ii rs eq 11 followed by rs desorption eq 12 eitel and taillefert 2017 the reduced structural fe ii could partially react with adsorbed o2 to form surface bounded fe iii o 2 and surface bound h2o2 eq 13 and 14 then oh was formed through heterogeneous fenton like reactions eq 15 most of fe ii rs could react with do to form intermediate surface bound fe ii rsoo eq 16 clay surfaces act as catalyst to accelerate the dissociation of surface bound rsoo to form oh eq 17 11 fe iii rsh fe ii rs h 12 fe ii rs o 2 fe ii rsoo 13 fe ii o 2 fe iii o 2 14 fe iii o 2 2 h fe iii h 2 o 2 15 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh oh 16 fe ii rs o2 fe ii rsoo 17 fe ii rsoo h fe iii rso oh 3 6 dft calculation and proposed mechanisms dft calculation was performed to unravel the reaction mechanisms of different lmwts in the absence and presence of nontronite surface to induce the formation oh or rs the optimized structures of lmwts in the absence of nontronite were shown in fig a9a the reactivity of lmwts with o2 is related to their ionization potentials p i liu et al 2011 the p i value of lmwts was ranged from 3 75 to 4 20 ev table 5 suggesting that the initial formation of rs would be relatively difficult it was consistent with the observed low k obs lmwts table 2 however once rs was formed it was relatively easy to produce ros species in the presence of do the subsequent interactions between lmwts and o2 were confirmed to be energetically favorable to produce more rs and to initiate the radical chain reactions cardey et al 2007 in this study o2 was experimentally observed in the both autoxidation and lmwts na nau 2 systems the reactions between lmwts and o2 were further calculated fig a9b and a9c the reactions between lmwts and o 2 form intermediate rsh o2 complexes first then one electron transfers from o2 to s atom coupled with h transferring to o2 to produce rs containing transition state ts which would further split into rs and ooh based on the reaction free energy profiles fig a10 it is energetically favorable for all lmwts especially gsh 33 74 kcal mol 1 to form the intermediate complexes with o2 the reaction energies were 9 91 12 72 kcal mol 1 for other lmwts with moderate reaction barriers ranged from 11 8 to 17 9 kcal mol 1 it was consistent with experimental observations that the k obs gsh was higher than other lmwts in the absence of na nau 2 table 2 the complexes of hcy and ca with o2 were slightly less stable and induced higher activation barrier to produce rs which might be the reason for the observed lower k obs lmwts for hcy and ca autoxidation the rate limiting step for lmwts autoxidation was the initial formation of rs as suggested by above discussion therefore we proposed that fe bearing smectite clay could act as a catalyst in electron transfer process from lmwts to the structural fe iii and stabilize formed surface bound fe ii rs to initiate the radical chain reactions eq 11 17 further dft calculations of lmwts interacting with the surface of fe bearing smectite were conducted based on previous studies decornez and hammes schiffer 1999 ghosh et al 2017 soudackov and hammes schiffer 1999 the h coupled electron transfer was considered as the plausible pathway for reactions between lmwts and fe bearing clay in which an electron was transferred from thiol group to structural fe iii coupled with the proton in s h transferred to the o in siloxane surface or the fe al bridging o through ditrigonal cativity after the interaction spin densities of structural fe changed from 4 35 to 3 74 and s from 0 0 to 0 38 0 52 respectively confirming the occurrence of electron transfer table 5 the calculated reaction energies e i for lmwts in the presence of fe bearing clay were significantly reduced by 2 ev as compared to their p i values except 0 2 ev for hcy table 5 the reaction energies were still slightly positive to produce the initial rs which might be due to the low fe iii content and lack of fe clustering in the simplified nontronite model supercell experimental evidence suggested that structural fe clusters were more reactive than isolated fe iii which would further reduce the energy barrier for rs formation moreover the order of the calculated e i values were well consistent with the sequence of observed c 96 h oh in the lmwts nontronite system altogether the dft calculations support that fe bearing clay act as a catalyst initially oxidizing lmwts and stabilizing the resultant rs to facilitate the chain reaction and produce oh 3 7 as iii transformation in the cys na nau 2 systems the reactivity of oh produced during the reaction between lwmts and nontronite towards the degradation of environmental contaminants was testifed by using as iii as the model contaminant the presence of cys in solution decreased inorganic as iii by 37 1 in which 16 3 was converted to inorganic as v due to oh attack grafe et al 2001 and 20 8 might be converted to organic as complex based on the total inorganic as concentration analysis fig 5 it has been reported that cys can form organic as complex with as iii or as v through amino groups carboxylic groups and thiol groups spuches et al 2005 in the na nau 2 suspension only 10 1 of as iii was adsorbed to clay particles and no significant conversion of as iii to as v fig 5 the addition of cys in the na nau 2 suspension decreased inorganic as iii concentration by 78 8 and the total inorganic as concentration by 36 8 which indicated that 42 0 of inorganic as iii was converted to inorganic as v the more inorganic as v formation was in line with more oh produced than in cys solution it is usually considered that organic as complex is less toxic than inorganic species ramesh et al 2007 therefore the interaction between na nau 2 and cys could contribute as iii detoxification in reaction system further experiments are needed in future to explore the environmental risks of these organic as complexes 4 conclusions this study investigated the interactions between fe bearing smectite minerals and lmwts and the formation of oh in the presence of do lmwts could be oxidized by oxygen to produce oh fe bearing clay minerals could accept electrons from lmwts through proton coupled electron transfer and clay surfaces could stabilize surface bound rs radicals and yield more oh the goefe iii in na nau 1 or tran distorted cis octfe iii sites in na nau 2 can react with lmwts faster than other structural fe sites in fe bearing smectites the structure of lmwts has important effects on the reactions for instance longer backbone chain gsh would destabilize the formed rs radicals it can be significantly stabilized by the interaction with nontronite surface solution ph had a significant influence on oh production by changing the speciation distribution of lmwts acidic condition facilitated the production of oh while the autoxidation of lmwts would be accelerated in alkalic evironment and decreased oh formation the formed oh in the cys na nau 2 system could effectively convert higher toxic inorganic as iii to lower toxic inorganic as v the study provides new insights into possible pathways of oh formation in the presence of fe bearing clay minerals and lmwts which could contribute to the natural attenuation and transformation of contaminants in natural environments declaration of competing interest the

18067,a novel technique for phosphorus recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate was developed using biochar derived from iron rich sludge dewatered sludge conditioned with fenton s reagent the biochar pyrolyzed from iron rich sludge at a low temperature of 300 c referred to as fe 300 biochar showed a better phosphorus p adsorption capacity most of orthophosphate and pyrophosphate than biochars pyrolyzed at other higher temperatures of 500 900 c with the maximum p adsorption capacity of up to 1 843 mg g 1 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate adsorption isotherms study indicated that 70 p was precipitated through chemical reaction with fe elements i e fe ii and fe iii existed on the surface of the fe 300 biochar and other 30 was through surface physical adsorption as simulated by a dual langmuir langmuir model using the potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate kh2po4 as a model solution the seed germination rate was increased up to 92 with the addition of fe 300 biochar after adsorbing most of p compared with 66 without the addition of biochar moreover p adsorbed by the chemical reaction in form of iron hydrogen phosphate can be solubilized by a phosphate solubilizing microorganism of pseudomonas aeruginosa with the total solubilized p amount of 3 045 mg g 1 at the end of an incubation of 20 days this study indicated that the iron rich sludge derived biochar could be used as a novel and beneficial functional material for p recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate the recovered p with biochar can be re utilized in garden soil as an efficient p fertilizer thus increasing the added values of both the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and the iron rich sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron rich sludge biochar

for all living organisms cordell et al 2009 due to a rapid economic development the demand of p as agricultural fertilizer and chemical products is increasing some studies have stated that p from primary phosphate rock resource will be depleted in 50 100 years if still following the current mining rates shepherd et al 2016 on the other hand a high concentration of p can cause serious environmental problem due to excessive release of p into water bodies such as eutrophication xu et al 2018 to prevent p pollution increasingly strict p discharge standards have been compulsively implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtp worldwide li et al 2019 in fact the p existed in the effluent of wwtp could be a potential resource for p recycling and recovery huang et al 2017 therefore developing technologies for p recovery from effluent of wwtp will not only prevent p pollution but also provide a sustainable p reclamation approach to alleviate p shortage crisis during the anaerobic digestion of sludge large amounts of anaerobic digestate can be generated which can be separated as solid phase and liquid phase the solid phase is a putative fertilizer with most of nutrients existed in particulate form which can reduce the mobility of nutrients and the risk of eutrophication through the soil runoff of excess nutrients świątczak et al 2019 the liquid phase is predominant with nutrients e g nitrogen n p and potassium k hence the liquid phase can be potentially used as fertilizer e g for microalgae cultivation so as to replace mineral fertilizers to some extent muhammad et al 2018 however compared with the solid phase the management of the liquid phase as fertilizer is difficult since the concentration of ammonium ions can account for up to several thousand mg per liter xia and murphy 2016 the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is typically either causally disposed into nearby arable land or discharged directly into water bodies thus causing nutrient leaching and lethal runoff win et al 2016 on the other hand the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate can be reused as renewed fertilizers since it contains large amounts of p content about 125 500 mg l 1 huang et al 2016 möller et al 2012 therefore a directional adsorption of p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is important for both proper disposal of anaerobic digestate and p reclamation numerous techniques have been used to reclaim p from wastewater e g membrane hybrid system qiu et al 2016 calcium precipitates lei et al 2019 algal based biosorption nhat et al 2018 struvite crystallization yan et al 2018 etc among which sludge derived biochar a carbon rich byproduct formed via pyrolysis has been used as fertilizer carbon fixator sorbent and mesoporous catalyst bridle and pritchard 2004 xiao et al 2018 currently the p adsorption performance of original biochar derived from sludge was low and hence various modified methods have been used to enhance the p adsorption efficiency chen et al 2011 synthesized magnetic biochars by chemical co precipitation of fe2 fe3 on orange peel powder and then pyrolyzing at different temperatures the iron oxide magnetite formed in the biochar was the key reason for enhanced p adsorption capability from water yang et al 2018 improved the p adsorption capacity of waste activated sludge based biochar through chemical co precipitation of fe3 fe2 or fecl3 impregnation michalekova richveisova et al 2017 improved the adsorption efficiency of biochar based adsorbents for p by fe impregnation through direct hydrolysis of fe no3 3 lee et al 2018 synthesized a new adsorbent to adsorb p through impregnating iron oxide on biochar derived from granular sludge via pyrolysis ren et al 2015 also enhanced p removal from water through immobilizing ferric oxides on biochars ren et al 2017 continued to use acidic alkaline and surfactant pretreatments followed by granulation and ferric oxide loading to enhance p removal from water takaya et al 2016 also improved biochar adsorption capacities of p by chemical modification with metal salts acids and alkalis however the use of pure chemicals or extra treatments were not cost effective or environmentally friendly therefore a concept of wasted iron rich sludge to useful product as p adsorbent needs to be proposed as a sustainable approach instead of using pure chemicals for p adsorption enhancement in previous literatures the inevitable generation of iron rich sludge during the sludge dewatering by fenton and fenton like reactions has posed great challenges to iron rich sludge treatment and disposal and simultaneously resulted in an unavoidable waste of iron resources emily et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 since the iron rich sludge was enriched with fe element the pyrolysis of iron rich sludge can be an alternative method to both enhance p adsorption through the role of iron species in iron rich sludge and re use the iron rich sludge however little is known about the feasibility of using biochar pyrolyzed from iron rich sludge to reclaim p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate p species is a key factor for any p recovery reclamation technology which determines p extractability and the adsorption ability of biochar and ultimately p reclamation efficiency huang et al 2017 it was reported that the fe element existed in the iron rich sludge can significantly affect p species during the pyrolysis process for example p species were predominated by orthophosphate and long chain polyphosphate in the waste activated sludge huang and tang 2015 as the pyrolysis process proceeded at 250 600 c p species were shifted from long chain polyphosphate to pyrophosphate and short chain polyphosphate huang and tang 2015 due to the large amounts of fe element existed in iron rich sludge after conditioning and dewatering processes an increase of total p a decrease of p mobility as sodium hydroxide naoh p and an increase of plant available p were obtained through the pyrolysis of iron rich sludge compared with the pyrolysis of raw sludge xiao et al 2019 however few studies have been carried out on the interaction effects between the iron rich biochar and p in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate moreover the related proportions of chemical and physical adsorptions remain unclear in addition few studies have been investigated on the bioavailability of p of both indigenously presented in the iron rich biochar and extra adsorbed from anaerobic digestate towards plant growth in fact the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is distinctive in composition thus posing a new challenge for p adsorption kizito et al 2017 hence it is necessary to characterize the related p adsorption efficiency by the iron rich biochar derived from iron rich sludge moreover the effects of iron rich biochar on the p adsorption efficiency and the subsequent fertilizer efficiency need to be further investigated the objectives of this study are to use the iron rich biochar pyrolyzed from the iron rich sludge to reclaim p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate the flowchart of this study is presented in fig s1 in brief the effects of pyrolysis temperatures on the efficiencies of iron rich biochar to adsorb p in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate were investigated with the biochar derived from the raw sludge rs as comparison various techniques e g x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps liquid 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometry sem eds were used to characterize the species of p and fe elements the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of iron rich biochar were investigated using different adsorption models and proportions of chemical and physical adsorption were studied the effects of coexisting anions on p adsorption efficiency were also investigated the p desorption and stability of iron rich biochar was further evaluated finally the effects of iron rich biochar on grass seed germination rate and seedling growth as well as p solubilization by a phosphate solubilizing microorganism psms were tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge samples the raw sludge rs used in this work was waste activated sludge obtained from the thickening tank of shahu wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in wuhan hubei china the influent is mainly municipal wastewater and its treatment process is anaerobic anoxic aerobic at a flow rate of 100 000 m3 d 1 in this plant rs after thickening was directly exposed to dewatering without the anaerobic digestion step which posed difficulty in the subsequent reduction of sludge volume hence rs was drawn and conditioned with fenton s reagent for sludge dewatering the anaerobic digestate was obtained from the anaerobic digestion tank of sanjintan wwtp in wuhan hubei china which also treated municipal wastewater using an anaerobic oxic process at a flow rate of 300 000 m3 d 1 the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate of sludge was obtained according to methods described in huang et al 2015 the main characteristics of waste activated sludge and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate are tabulated in table s1 in the supporting information the samples were stored at 4 c and all of the experiments were completed within one week 2 2 biochar preparation details for biochar preparation can be found in our previous work xiao et al 2019 briefly the waste activated sludge was conditioned with fenton s reagent 110 mg fe ii g 1 volatile solids vs and 88 mg hydrogen peroxide h2o2 g 1vs yu et al 2016 2017 with rs without any addition of reagents as the control both these two sludge samples were then dewatered using a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press xiao et al 2019 dried and were finally exposed to pyrolysis argon of 99 99 purity was passed through the reactor at a continuous flow rate of 100 ml min 1 at a set temperature for 2 h and then was cooled down to room temperature naturally biochars pyrolyzed from the dewatered rs cake at different temperatures of 300 c 500 c 700 c 800 c and 900 c were named as rs 300 rs 500 rs 700 rs 800 and rs 900 respectively while biochars pyrolyzed from the iron rich sludge cake conditioned with fenton s reagent at different temperatures of 300 c 500 c 700 c 800 c and 900 c were named as fe 300 fe 500 fe 700 fe 800 and fe 900 respectively the biochar samples were dried and stored in a desiccator for the subsequent experiments a portion of biochar samples was used for analyses of xrd xps and sem 2 3 adsorption and desorption 2 3 1 comparison of tp removal efficiencies of the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar towards different p solutions to investigate effects of temperature on the tp removal

in 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes similarly all the samples were shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h at room temperature then the samples of 20 ml were filtered to determine the tp concentration of the filtrate a ph meter s220 k mettler toledo switzerland was used to monitor ph changes the post adsorbed biochar samples were collected for further analyses by xrd xps and sem eds for the analysis of adsorption kinetics of p by the fe 300 biochar similarly 0 3 g of fe 300 biochar sample was mixed with 20 ml of kh2po4 solution 46 mg p l 1 in a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube and then were shaken at 150 rpm at room temperature at the desired time intervals 0 4 18 24 40 48 and 52 h the solution was separated from solids by filtration 2 3 3 effect of coexisting anions to investigate

cl no3 and hco3 were added in form of salts e g nacl nano3 or nahco3 into the kh2po4 solution independently and were subsequently exposed to shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h at room temperature for samples described in sections 2 3 1 2 3 3 samples were drawn for the measurement of the tp concentration 2 3 4 adsorption desorption cycle stability test and regeneration performance the p desorption experiment was conducted to test stability of fe 300 biochar in brief the fe 300 biochar was mixed with 46 mg p l 1 of kh2po4 solution in a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube at a mixing speed of 150 rpm for 24 h at room temperature with the adsorbent dose of 15 g l 1 afterwards the fe 300 biochar was collected by filtration and then dried after the separation of fe 300 biochar the equilibrium tp concentration in the filtrate was measured then the collected fe 300 biochar was then immersed in 0 25 mol l 1 of naoh solution to regenerate followed by shaking at room temperature with a mixing speed of 150 rpm for 6 h the fe 300 biochar regenerated by the naoh solution was then separated from the solution firstly and was washed with ultrapure water until ph value was neutral for the next adsorption cycle five adsorption desorption cycles were conducted the p desorption efficiency pdes is calculated by the following eq 1 1 p d e s c d v d q e m where cd mg l 1 denotes the desorption

to investigate the potential application of the fe 300 biochar as a slow release fertilizer the experiment was performed on a layer of filter paper and each treatment contained 50 grass seeds pennisetum alopecuroides l which was then moistened with ultrapure water in containers with 0 1 g of various biochar samples to be specific the control group without addition of biochar rs 300 biochar fe 300 biochar fe 300 biochar adsorbed with p derived from kh2po4 fe 300 kh2po4 and fe 300 biochar adsorbed with p derived from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fe 300 ad were set for comparison all the samples were incubated at room temperature after an incubation of 3 days the seed germination rate in each container was calculated after an incubation of 10 days the length of randomly chosen 10 seedlings was determined with a millimeter scale for statistical analysis all experiments were conducted for five replicates 2 5 the solubilization of p by pseudomonas aeruginosa the bacterial strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa cctcc 91095 was obtained from china center for type culture collection cctcc in lyophilized powder the bacterial strain was firstly incubated at 37 1 c with shaking at 150 rpm for 48 h in luria bertani lb liquid medium which was consisted of tryptone 10 g yeast extract 5 g and nacl 10 g in 1 l deionized water and the ph value was adjusted to 7 0 2 with 1 mol l 1 naoh or hcl after incubation the bacteria samples were stored at 20 c before each experiment p aeruginosa was incubated again in lb liquid medium until the optical

analytical methods the concentration of dissolved ortho phosphate was measured by the phosphomolybdate colorimetric assay using a uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan while the measurement of total p was performed after peroxodisulfate digestion and the molybdenum blue complex can be formed subsequently which was then measured by the phosphomolybdate colorimetric assay using the same uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan murphy and riley 1962 other analytical methods please refer to text s1 of the supporting information for measurements of the related p species the characteristics zeta potential ph functionalities morphology etc of biochar before and after p adsorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar 3 1 1 the ph value yield specific surface area and zeta potential the characteristics of biochars produced at various temperatures are summarized in table 1 e g the yield rate and surface area of biochar as well as ph value and zeta potential of the leaching solution of biochar the increased pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 900 c contributed to the decreased yield rates of the rs biochar and iron rich biochar from 74 41 wt to 56 29 wt and 77 74 wt to 54 44 wt respectively this can be related to the gradual volatilization of the organic substances with the removal of oxygenated functional groups e g hydroxyl carboxylic and carbonyl groups in sludge tan et al 2014 the highest specific surface areas were obtained at 700 c for biochar pyrolyzed from rs 16 61 m2 g 1 and of 700 c for biochar pyrolyzed from iron rich sludge 59 04 m2 g 1 meanwhile the leaching solution of biochar was acidic when produced at a lower treatment temperature but shifting to alkaline at 500 c onwards this might be due to the decomposition of organic acid and carbonate during the pyrolysis process hence the alkalinity of biochar became stronger at higher pyrolysis temperatures yuan et al 2011 moreover the zeta potential of the leaching solution of biochar samples pyrolyzed at higher temperatures of 500 900 c became more negative than those pyrolyzed at lower temperatures e g 300 c causing them difficult to adsorb the negatively charged po4 3 due to the electrostatic interactions more information about the contents of main metal elements can be found in text s2 of the supporting information 3 1 2 ftir ftir spectra of biochars derived from both the rs sludge and the iron rich sludge pyrolyzed at different temperatures 300 900 c are shown in fig s2 supporting information the fe o bond at 580 cm 1 can be observed in both the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar possibly due to the indigenous iron existed in waste activated sludge and the extra added fenton s reagent for the aliphatic ch2 bond at 2921 cm 1 2849 cm 1 and 1447 cm 1 it can be observed in both the rs 300 biochar and the fe 300 biochar however it disappeared as the pyrolysis temperature increased above 300 c which may be attributed to the decomposition of organic compounds e g lipid containing the aliphatic ch2 bond 3 2 comparison of tp removal efficiencies of the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar tp removal efficiencies from the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate by the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar pyrolyzed at various temperatures are shown in fig 1 for the rs biochar the rs 700 biochar showed the highest tp removal efficiencies of 45 for the kh2po4 solution fig 1a and up to 65 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fig 1b respectively increased tp removal efficiencies were noted for both the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 c possibly due to the increased specific surface areas of rs biochar samples as the pyrolysis temperature increased up till 700 c table 1 which can be related to the accelerated carbonization degree wang et al 2019 at the pyrolysis temperature of 800 c indiscernible increases in the tp removal efficiencies were noted for the rs biochar in both the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate which can be related to the indiscernible changes of surface area at the pyrolysis temperature of 800 c table 1 while continuously increasing the pyrolysis temperature up to 900 c the tp removal efficiencies decreased for both the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate considering the decreased surface areas at the pyrolysis of 900 c table 1 it can be deduced that the pyrolysis temperature above 800 c may destroy the pore walls between adjacent pores and pores may be restrained accordingly zou et al 2013 interestingly it is noted that the rs biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c showed negative tp removal efficiency towards the kh2po4 solution the rs 300 biochar may not adsorb phosphorus but release it instead and the release degree may exceed the adsorption degree supporting information fig s3 however it shows the different trend for the iron rich biochar despite its higher specific surface area at the increased pyrolysis temperature of 500 800 c table 1 it is noted that the iron rich biochar derived from iron rich sludge at a lower temperature of 300 c the fe 300 biochar showed the highest tp removal efficiency for both the kh2po4 solution 84 fig 1a and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate 66 fig 1b considering the relatively lower surface area of the fe 300 biochar and its better adsorption efficiency it can be deduced that the p adsorption by the fe 300 biochar may be not determined by the physical adsorption alone since a high abundance of fe element total iron content of 84 37 mg g 1ds existed in the fe biochar supporting information table s2 it is hypothesized that the chemical reactions between fe species and p may also contribute to the higher tp adsorption efficiency which shall be discussed later moreover for the fe 500 fe 700 fe 800 and fe 900 biochars due to more negative charges on their surfaces as discussed above table 1 it may be difficult for them to adsorb the negatively charged po4 3 due to the electrostatic repulsive interactions furthermore a series of phase transformations of the iron containing phases in iron rich sludge could take place during sludge pyrolysis in this study the fe ii and fe iii species were predominant in biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c which would be further reduced into zero valent iron fe0 under the reducing gases of carbon monoxide and hydrogen during sludge pyrolysis at higher temperature of 800 900 c as found in our previous studies tao et al 2019 as is known zero valent iron showed less adsorption capability towards p than fe ii and fe iii species eljamal et al 2016 khalil et al 2017 hence it can be concluded that the chemical adsorptions towards p by biochars derived at 500 900 c were less than that of biochar derived at 300 c comparing the tp removal efficiencies of both the fe biochar and the rs biochar it is noted that the highest tp removal efficiency was achieved by the fe 300 biochar in both the kh2po4 solution 84 and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate 66 thus the fe 300 biochar was chosen as the representative one for the subsequent adsorption and desorption experiments 3 3 adsorption and desorption mechanisms 3 3 1 the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of p by the fe 300 biochar for the kh2po4 solution and liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fig 2 a shows that the amounts of p adsorbed by the fe 300 biochar increased rapidly at the early stage while a slower adsorption rate was observed as the adsorption process proceeded possibly due to the decrease of active adsorption sties yang et al 2018 two adsorption kinetic models were used to evaluate p adsorption kinetics by the fe 300 biochar the results indicated that the pseudo second order model was more suitable to describe the interaction between p in the kh2po4 solution and fe element existed in the iron rich biochar due to its relatively higher r2 than the pseudo first order model 0 992 versus 0 976 these results indicated that chemisorption mechanism may be involved in the adsorption of phosphorus by the fe 300 biochar yoon et al 2014 to study the adsorption isotherms two widely used isotherms models freundlich and langmuir models were used to fit the experimental data and the fitted parameters are presented in fig 2b as can be seen freundlich adsorption parameter kf was 1 369 mg g 1 which was lower than the actual capacity of 2 628 mg g 1 fig 2b in contrast qm of 2 643 mg g 1 fitted from the langmuir isotherms fitted well with the experimental data of 2 628 mg g 1 fig 2b moreover the langmuir model owns a higher r2 value than the freundlich model 0 986 versus 0 936 the well fitted langmuir model indicated that p adsorption by the fe 300 biochar may follow a monolayer adsorption process ifthikar et al 2017 considering the hypothesized physical sorption chemical precipitation mechanism for fe 300 biochar as discussed in section 3 2 the p adsorption on the fe 300 biochar was further evaluated by a dual langmuir langmuir model which can describe the metal adsorption process e g surface adsorption precipitation and complexation das et al 2007 it is noted that p adsorption can be better fitted to the langmuir langmuir model than the langmuir model alone with a higher r2 value 0 989 versus 0 986 and qp the precipitation amount per unit mass of the fe 300 biochar was higher than qa the adsorption amount per unit mass of the fe 300 biochar in the langmuir langmuir model fig 2c it can be deduced that chemical precipitation was mainly responsible for p retention by the fe element existed on the surface of fe 300 biochar 70 calculated from qp divided by the summation of qa and qp the remaining 30 qa divided by the summation of qa and qp can be related with physical adsorption possibly via complexation of p with surface functional group which shall be discussed later text s3 and fig s4 supporting information show details of the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of the fe 300 biochar for p adsorption in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and similar adsorption kinetics can be obtained in comparison with p adsorption in the kh2po4 solution interestingly it is noted that the maximum phosphorus adsorption capability of the fe 300 biochar was higher for the kh2po4 solution 2 628 mg g 1 fig 2b than for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate 1 843 mg g 1 fig s4b as shown in fig s4c the langmuir langmuir model failed to fit the data the presence of anion ions such as cl hco3 and no3 in actual liquid phase of anaerobic digestate may potentially interfere with the adsorption of p suggesting that the langmuir langmuir model was more suitable for the pure solution rather than the complex liquid phase of anaerobic digestate the results of fig s5 indicated that with the presence of hco3 the p adsorption capability significantly decreased with the difference significant p 0 05 indicating that hco3 may compete with p for adsorption sites on biochar yang et al 2018 however cl and no3 showed indiscernible effects on the p adsorption with the difference was insignificant p 0 05 this may be because the adsorption of cl and no3 belonged to non specific adsorption and the outer sphere complexes may be formed thus not interfering with p adsorption loganathan et al 2014 as summarized in table s3 supporting information the adsorption capacities towards p of biochars derived from various substrates were different in fact the adsorption capacity of biochar towards p was strongly dependent on the amount of chemically available iron on biochar moreover as can be seen the kh2po4 solution was commonly used as the simulated adsorbate in most of previous studies in this study the iron rich biochar fe 300 biochar adsorbed with p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate might be used as a p fertilizer which shall be investigated in the following study 3 3 2 phosphorus desorption of fe 300 biochar the p desorption of the fe 300 biochar was conducted to evaluate its recycling and regeneration performance for p removal efficiency it is noted that there were indiscernible changes of p adsorption capability of fe 300 biochar after 5 successive adsorption desorption cycles with the final desorption efficiency of still more than 97 of the adsorption capacity at the fifth cycle fig 1c these results suggested that the fe 300 biochar pyrolyzed in this study exhibited superior stability of adsorption desorption cycles and may be potentially used to reclaim p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate however it is also noted that the desorption efficiency failed to reach 100 indicating that p on the adsorbent was not completely reversible and the bonding force between the iron and phosphorus may be strong zeng et al 2004 for the adsorption process at low ph values less than ph 4 p can be protonated mainly as h2po4 or hpo4 2 du et al 2016 these protonated p species were not effectively adsorbed by the positively charged fe ions of the fe 300 biochar due to the completion of hydrogen ion and fe ii fe iii ions for adsorption sites zhou et al 2005 the adsorption capacity of p by the fe 300 biochar increased while further increasing ph to 4 00 due to the ion exchange between p and hydroxyl ions and it was stabilized while continuously increasing the ph values till ph of 11 00 liao et al 2019 for the desorption process as the ph values increased the p desorption efficiencies increased since the hydroxyl ion might compete with p species for surface sites more p species could be desorbed in this study for the adsorption process the ph values of all solutions added with biochars synthesized at 300 900 c for both the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate were in the range of 5 50 8 11 within this range the p adsorption capacity by the fe 300 biochar remains the same regardless of the fluctuations of ph values as shown in fig s6 in supporting information as for the desorption process 0 25 mol l 1 naoh solution was used as the desorption reagent after each desorption the biochar was washed with ultrapure water firstly till the ph of the elute solution was close to neutral prior to the next sorption desorption cycle hence the ph fluctuations may also show indiscernible effects on the sorption desorption cycle 3 4 p species before and after the adsorption of the fe 300 biochar the liquid 31p nmr spectroscopy was used to compare p species before and after the adsorption of the fe 300 biochar shown in fig s7 as can be seen the predominant p species in the fe 300 biochar before adsorption were inorganic p namely ortho p and pyro p the results of huang and tang 2015 supported this finding that p species shifted to inorganic p mainly ortho p and pyro p due to the decomposition of the long chain polyphosphate during the pyrolysis process after adsorbing p in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fe 300 ad although no new p species appeared the p peak intensities of both ortho p and pyro p in the fe 300 ad biochar p were higher than those of the original fe 300 biochar before adsorption supporting information table s4 in association with the large amount of inorganic p content existed 94 79 in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate supporting information table s5 which has been reported to be predominant in forms of ortho p and pyro p smith et al 2006 it is therefore deduced that the fe 300 biochar may be effective in adsorbing inorganic p e g ortho p and pyro p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate 3 5 the adsorption mechanism of p with the fe 300 biochar fig 3 shows the xrd patterns of the fe 300 biochar before and after p adsorption for the kh2po4 solution compared with the fe 300 biochar before p adsorption it is noted that the xrd pattern of fe 300 kh2po4 showed a strong signal of new fe p crystal in form of iron hydrogen phosphate after p adsorption from the kh2po4 solution fig 3 and the solution ph values before and after the adsorption process were 5 50 and 4 44 respectively the p species predominated as h2po4 at this ph range which may interact with the released fe i e fe ii and fe iii to form the iron hydrogen phosphate compared with that before adsorption fig s8a the sem results indicated that more appearance of small particles was observed after the adsorption of p by the fe 300 biochar figs s8b c the energy dispersive spectrometry eds spectra indicated that the main elements of the fe 300 biochar were determined to be c o si al fe and p fig s8d confirming the formation of iron hydrogen phosphate on the surface of the fe 300 biochar similar results can be obtained using the fe 300 biochar to adsorb p in the kh2po4 solution figs s8e g to further study the interaction between fe 300 biochar and p the xps spectra of fe 2p and p 2p were evaluated based on the assigned binding energies at 729 5 ev for fe ii and 724 8 ev for fe iii xu et al 2016 the predominant fe species in the fe 300 biochar before adsorption fe 300 after p adsorption for the kh2po4 solution fe 300 kh2po4 and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fe 300 ad were all fe ii and fe iii fig 4 a c these fe species i e fe ii and fe iii may possibly contribute to the chemical precipitation between fe and p as mentioned above figs 2 and 3 and s8 after p adsorption the presence of p is noted in all these samples at the binding energy of 133 40 v fig 4e and f it is noted that percentage of the normalized p peak area increased in fe 300 kh2po4 and fe 300 ad than that in fe 300 indicating the shift of p from the liquid phase to the biochar samples fig 4e and f 3 6 grass seed germination rate and early stage seedling growth further to confirming the feasibility of p adsorbed biochars as a prospective p fertilizer pot experiments were performed fig 5 the seed germination rate increased from 66 blank group to 96 and 92 with the addition of respective fe 300 kh2po4 and fe 300 ad p adsorbed biochars fig 5a after 10 days growth lengths of the grass shoot in samples with p adsorbed fe 300 kh2po4 and fe 300 ad were longer than other groups of control rs 300 and fe 300 fig 5b and c these results can be supported by the results of yao et al 2013 that the presence of phosphorus not only improved the seed germination rate but also enhanced seedling growth moreover it is worth noting that iron hydrogen phosphate identified in iron rich biochar was insoluble which might reduce their plant availability it is highly possible that p available for seed germination rate and early stage growth was mainly from the surface adsorption through physical adsorption 3 7 the solubilization of p adsorbed by fe 300 biochar the by p aeruginosa as mentioned above 70 of p was adsorbed through a chemical reaction by fe 300 biochar in form of iron hydrogen phosphate fig 2 which is insoluble thus affecting their availability for plant utilization as the phosphate solubilizing microorganism was capable to solubilize fe p minerals and increase p plant availability chuang et al 2007 hence their capability to solubilize the chemically adsorbed p was studied herein after an incubation of 20 days the total amount of p solubilized from fe 300 ad biochar was up to 3 045 mg g 1 fig 6 as mentioned above the maximum p adsorption capacity of fe 300 biochar was up to 1 843 mg g 1 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate the p released from the fe 300 ad biochar was consisted of p adsorbed from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and p existed in the fe 300 biochar 2 232 mg g 1 water soluble p and 20 088 mg g 1 fe p xiao et al 2019 for p adsorbed from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate theoretically 0 553 mg g 1 was adsorbed by a physical reaction basing on a 30 ratio 1 843 0 3 0 553 mg g 1 and 1 290 mg g 1 was adsorbed by a chemical reaction basing on a 70 ratio 1 843 0 7 1 290 mg g 1 even if all the water soluble p and p adsorbed by a physical reaction were released into the liquid phase it is noted that these partial of p 0 553 2 232 2 785 mg g 1 was less than 3 045 mg g 1 fig 6 from these calculations it can be deduced that p in form of fe p either sourced from fe p in the fe 300 biochar or from the indigenous p adsorbed by a chemical reaction from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate must have been be released into the liquid phase to further investigate the species of p released from the fe 300 ad biochar incubated with p aeruginosa the concentrations of different p species in the liquid before and after an incubation of 20 days are shown in fig s9 supporting information the concentrations of ortho p and pyro p increased for the fe 300 ad biochar incubated with p aeruginosa after an incubation of 20 days ortho p 0 79 mg g 1 versus 0 04 mg g 1 pyro p 2 26 mg g 1 versus 0 07 mg g 1 these results indicated that the p aeruginosa can promote the release of both ortho p and pyro p from biochar into the liquid phase which may promote plant growth 3 8 a potential p fertilizer using biochar derived from iron rich sludge for p adsorption from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate in this study a sustainable sludge recycling strategy and p recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate was developed by using sludge derived iron rich biochar pyrolyzed at a low temperature of 300 c fig 7 the fe 300 biochar showed a maximum p adsorption capacity of up to 1 843 mg g 1 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and 70 p was precipitated through chemical reaction with fe element existed on the surface of the fe 300 biochar and other 30 was through surface physical adsorption most of p adsorbed by the iron rich biochar was plant available and the seed germination rate was increased up to 92 with the addition of fe 300 biochar after adsorbing most of p compared with 66 without the addition of biochar moreover p adsorbed by chemical reaction in form of iron hydrogen phosphate can be solubilized by a phosphate solubilizing microorganism of p aeruginosa with the total solubilized p amount of 3 045 mg g 1 at the end of an incubation of 20 days therefore the sustainable sludge recycling system proposed in this study would provide a promising prospect for both sludge treatment in wwtps and p recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate thus showing significant environmental benefits the conversion of wasted iron rich sludge to useful product as phosphate adsorbent meets the requirements of circular economy 4 conclusions the feasibility of using iron rich biochar derived from iron rich sludge to adsorb p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate was investigated the main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the fe 300 biochar pyrolyzed from iron rich sludge at a low temperature of 300 c showed better tp removal efficiency than the biochars pyrolyzed at other higher temperatures of 500 900 c 2 the fe 300 biochar showed a maximum p adsorption capacity of 1 843 mg g 1 for p reclamation in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and most of orthophosphate and pyrophosphate in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate can be removed 3 the p adsorption process was comprised of 70 p precipitation through chemical reaction with fe ii and fe iii elements existed on the surface of iron rich biochar and 30 surface physical adsorption 4 most of the p retained in the iron rich biochar was bioavailable and could stimulate seed germination rate of up to 92 compared with the control group of 66 without any biochar addition 5 p aeruginosa can solubilize p adsorbed by a chemical reaction and then promoting the release of both ortho p and pyro p into the liquid phase declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18067,a novel technique for phosphorus recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate was developed using biochar derived from iron rich sludge dewatered sludge conditioned with fenton s reagent the biochar pyrolyzed from iron rich sludge at a low temperature of 300 c referred to as fe 300 biochar showed a better phosphorus p adsorption capacity most of orthophosphate and pyrophosphate than biochars pyrolyzed at other higher temperatures of 500 900 c with the maximum p adsorption capacity of up to 1 843 mg g 1 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate adsorption isotherms study indicated that 70 p was precipitated through chemical reaction with fe elements i e fe ii and fe iii existed on the surface of the fe 300 biochar and other 30 was through surface physical adsorption as simulated by a dual langmuir langmuir model using the potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate kh2po4 as a model solution the seed germination rate was increased up to 92 with the addition of fe 300 biochar after adsorbing most of p compared with 66 without the addition of biochar moreover p adsorbed by the chemical reaction in form of iron hydrogen phosphate can be solubilized by a phosphate solubilizing microorganism of pseudomonas aeruginosa with the total solubilized p amount of 3 045 mg g 1 at the end of an incubation of 20 days this study indicated that the iron rich sludge derived biochar could be used as a novel and beneficial functional material for p recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate the recovered p with biochar can be re utilized in garden soil as an efficient p fertilizer thus increasing the added values of both the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and the iron rich sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron rich sludge biochar

for all living organisms cordell et al 2009 due to a rapid economic development the demand of p as agricultural fertilizer and chemical products is increasing some studies have stated that p from primary phosphate rock resource will be depleted in 50 100 years if still following the current mining rates shepherd et al 2016 on the other hand a high concentration of p can cause serious environmental problem due to excessive release of p into water bodies such as eutrophication xu et al 2018 to prevent p pollution increasingly strict p discharge standards have been compulsively implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtp worldwide li et al 2019 in fact the p existed in the effluent of wwtp could be a potential resource for p recycling and recovery huang et al 2017 therefore developing technologies for p recovery from effluent of wwtp will not only prevent p pollution but also provide a sustainable p reclamation approach to alleviate p shortage crisis during the anaerobic digestion of sludge large amounts of anaerobic digestate can be generated which can be separated as solid phase and liquid phase the solid phase is a putative fertilizer with most of nutrients existed in particulate form which can reduce the mobility of nutrients and the risk of eutrophication through the soil runoff of excess nutrients świątczak et al 2019 the liquid phase is predominant with nutrients e g nitrogen n p and potassium k hence the liquid phase can be potentially used as fertilizer e g for microalgae cultivation so as to replace mineral fertilizers to some extent muhammad et al 2018 however compared with the solid phase the management of the liquid phase as fertilizer is difficult since the concentration of ammonium ions can account for up to several thousand mg per liter xia and murphy 2016 the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is typically either causally disposed into nearby arable land or discharged directly into water bodies thus causing nutrient leaching and lethal runoff win et al 2016 on the other hand the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate can be reused as renewed fertilizers since it contains large amounts of p content about 125 500 mg l 1 huang et al 2016 möller et al 2012 therefore a directional adsorption of p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is important for both proper disposal of anaerobic digestate and p reclamation numerous techniques have been used to reclaim p from wastewater e g membrane hybrid system qiu et al 2016 calcium precipitates lei et al 2019 algal based biosorption nhat et al 2018 struvite crystallization yan et al 2018 etc among which sludge derived biochar a carbon rich byproduct formed via pyrolysis has been used as fertilizer carbon fixator sorbent and mesoporous catalyst bridle and pritchard 2004 xiao et al 2018 currently the p adsorption performance of original biochar derived from sludge was low and hence various modified methods have been used to enhance the p adsorption efficiency chen et al 2011 synthesized magnetic biochars by chemical co precipitation of fe2 fe3 on orange peel powder and then pyrolyzing at different temperatures the iron oxide magnetite formed in the biochar was the key reason for enhanced p adsorption capability from water yang et al 2018 improved the p adsorption capacity of waste activated sludge based biochar through chemical co precipitation of fe3 fe2 or fecl3 impregnation michalekova richveisova et al 2017 improved the adsorption efficiency of biochar based adsorbents for p by fe impregnation through direct hydrolysis of fe no3 3 lee et al 2018 synthesized a new adsorbent to adsorb p through impregnating iron oxide on biochar derived from granular sludge via pyrolysis ren et al 2015 also enhanced p removal from water through immobilizing ferric oxides on biochars ren et al 2017 continued to use acidic alkaline and surfactant pretreatments followed by granulation and ferric oxide loading to enhance p removal from water takaya et al 2016 also improved biochar adsorption capacities of p by chemical modification with metal salts acids and alkalis however the use of pure chemicals or extra treatments were not cost effective or environmentally friendly therefore a concept of wasted iron rich sludge to useful product as p adsorbent needs to be proposed as a sustainable approach instead of using pure chemicals for p adsorption enhancement in previous literatures the inevitable generation of iron rich sludge during the sludge dewatering by fenton and fenton like reactions has posed great challenges to iron rich sludge treatment and disposal and simultaneously resulted in an unavoidable waste of iron resources emily et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 since the iron rich sludge was enriched with fe element the pyrolysis of iron rich sludge can be an alternative method to both enhance p adsorption through the role of iron species in iron rich sludge and re use the iron rich sludge however little is known about the feasibility of using biochar pyrolyzed from iron rich sludge to reclaim p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate p species is a key factor for any p recovery reclamation technology which determines p extractability and the adsorption ability of biochar and ultimately p reclamation efficiency huang et al 2017 it was reported that the fe element existed in the iron rich sludge can significantly affect p species during the pyrolysis process for example p species were predominated by orthophosphate and long chain polyphosphate in the waste activated sludge huang and tang 2015 as the pyrolysis process proceeded at 250 600 c p species were shifted from long chain polyphosphate to pyrophosphate and short chain polyphosphate huang and tang 2015 due to the large amounts of fe element existed in iron rich sludge after conditioning and dewatering processes an increase of total p a decrease of p mobility as sodium hydroxide naoh p and an increase of plant available p were obtained through the pyrolysis of iron rich sludge compared with the pyrolysis of raw sludge xiao et al 2019 however few studies have been carried out on the interaction effects between the iron rich biochar and p in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate moreover the related proportions of chemical and physical adsorptions remain unclear in addition few studies have been investigated on the bioavailability of p of both indigenously presented in the iron rich biochar and extra adsorbed from anaerobic digestate towards plant growth in fact the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is distinctive in composition thus posing a new challenge for p adsorption kizito et al 2017 hence it is necessary to characterize the related p adsorption efficiency by the iron rich biochar derived from iron rich sludge moreover the effects of iron rich biochar on the p adsorption efficiency and the subsequent fertilizer efficiency need to be further investigated the objectives of this study are to use the iron rich biochar pyrolyzed from the iron rich sludge to reclaim p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate the flowchart of this study is presented in fig s1 in brief the effects of pyrolysis temperatures on the efficiencies of iron rich biochar to adsorb p in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate were investigated with the biochar derived from the raw sludge rs as comparison various techniques e g x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps liquid 31p nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometry sem eds were used to characterize the species of p and fe elements the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of iron rich biochar were investigated using different adsorption models and proportions of chemical and physical adsorption were studied the effects of coexisting anions on p adsorption efficiency were also investigated the p desorption and stability of iron rich biochar was further evaluated finally the effects of iron rich biochar on grass seed germination rate and seedling growth as well as p solubilization by a phosphate solubilizing microorganism psms were tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge samples the raw sludge rs used in this work was waste activated sludge obtained from the thickening tank of shahu wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in wuhan hubei china the influent is mainly municipal wastewater and its treatment process is anaerobic anoxic aerobic at a flow rate of 100 000 m3 d 1 in this plant rs after thickening was directly exposed to dewatering without the anaerobic digestion step which posed difficulty in the subsequent reduction of sludge volume hence rs was drawn and conditioned with fenton s reagent for sludge dewatering the anaerobic digestate was obtained from the anaerobic digestion tank of sanjintan wwtp in wuhan hubei china which also treated municipal wastewater using an anaerobic oxic process at a flow rate of 300 000 m3 d 1 the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate of sludge was obtained according to methods described in huang et al 2015 the main characteristics of waste activated sludge and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate are tabulated in table s1 in the supporting information the samples were stored at 4 c and all of the experiments were completed within one week 2 2 biochar preparation details for biochar preparation can be found in our previous work xiao et al 2019 briefly the waste activated sludge was conditioned with fenton s reagent 110 mg fe ii g 1 volatile solids vs and 88 mg hydrogen peroxide h2o2 g 1vs yu et al 2016 2017 with rs without any addition of reagents as the control both these two sludge samples were then dewatered using a laboratory scale diaphragm filter press xiao et al 2019 dried and were finally exposed to pyrolysis argon of 99 99 purity was passed through the reactor at a continuous flow rate of 100 ml min 1 at a set temperature for 2 h and then was cooled down to room temperature naturally biochars pyrolyzed from the dewatered rs cake at different temperatures of 300 c 500 c 700 c 800 c and 900 c were named as rs 300 rs 500 rs 700 rs 800 and rs 900 respectively while biochars pyrolyzed from the iron rich sludge cake conditioned with fenton s reagent at different temperatures of 300 c 500 c 700 c 800 c and 900 c were named as fe 300 fe 500 fe 700 fe 800 and fe 900 respectively the biochar samples were dried and stored in a desiccator for the subsequent experiments a portion of biochar samples was used for analyses of xrd xps and sem 2 3

in 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes similarly all the samples were shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h at room temperature then the samples of 20 ml were filtered to determine the tp concentration of the filtrate a ph meter s220 k mettler toledo switzerland was used to monitor ph changes the post adsorbed biochar samples were collected for further analyses by xrd xps and sem eds for the analysis of adsorption kinetics of p by the fe 300 biochar similarly 0 3 g of fe 300 biochar sample was mixed with 20 ml of kh2po4 solution 46 mg p l 1 in a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube and then were shaken at 150 rpm at room temperature at the desired time intervals 0 4 18 24 40 48 and 52 h the solution was separated from solids by filtration 2 3 3 effect of coexisting anions to investigate effects of coexisting anions on the p adsorption efficiency 0 3 g of the fe 300 biochar was mixed with 20 ml of kh2po4 solution 46 mg p l 1 in 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and 1 2 mol l 1 of cl no3 and hco3 were added in form of salts e g nacl nano3 or nahco3 into the kh2po4 solution independently and were subsequently exposed to shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h at room temperature for samples described in sections 2 3 1 2 3 3 samples were drawn for the measurement of the tp concentration 2 3 4 adsorption desorption cycle stability test and regeneration performance the p desorption experiment was conducted to test stability of fe 300 biochar in brief the fe 300 biochar was mixed with 46 mg p l 1 of kh2po4 solution in a 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube at a mixing speed of 150 rpm for 24 h at room temperature with the adsorbent dose of 15 g l 1 afterwards the fe 300 biochar was collected by filtration and then dried after the separation of fe 300 biochar the equilibrium tp concentration in the filtrate was measured then the collected fe 300 biochar was then immersed in 0 25 mol l 1 of naoh solution to regenerate followed by shaking at room temperature with a mixing speed of 150 rpm for 6 h the fe 300 biochar regenerated by the naoh solution was then separated from the solution firstly and was washed with ultrapure water until ph value was neutral for the next adsorption cycle five adsorption desorption cycles were conducted the p desorption efficiency pdes is calculated by the following eq 1 1 p d e s c d v d q e m where cd mg l 1 denotes the desorption

to investigate the potential application of the fe 300 biochar as a slow release fertilizer the experiment was performed on a layer of filter paper and each treatment contained 50 grass seeds pennisetum alopecuroides l which was then moistened with ultrapure water in containers with 0 1 g of various biochar samples to be specific the control group without addition of biochar rs 300 biochar fe 300 biochar fe 300 biochar adsorbed with p derived from kh2po4 fe 300 kh2po4 and fe 300 biochar adsorbed with p derived from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fe 300 ad were set for comparison all the samples were incubated at room temperature after an incubation of 3 days the seed germination rate in each container was calculated after an incubation of 10 days the length of randomly chosen 10 seedlings was determined with a millimeter scale for statistical analysis all experiments were conducted for five replicates 2 5 the solubilization of p by pseudomonas aeruginosa the bacterial strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa cctcc 91095 was obtained from china center for type culture collection cctcc in lyophilized powder the bacterial strain was firstly incubated at 37 1 c with shaking at 150 rpm for 48 h in luria bertani lb liquid medium which was consisted of tryptone 10 g yeast extract 5 g and nacl 10 g in 1 l deionized water and the ph value was adjusted to 7 0 2 with 1 mol l 1 naoh or hcl after incubation the bacteria samples were stored at 20 c before each experiment p aeruginosa was incubated again in lb liquid medium until the optical density of bacteria suspension at 600 nm od600 reached 0 8 1 adsorbance then the suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded the residual bacteria pellets were washed three times and suspended with the mineral liquid medium mlm to prepare the incubation solution qian et al 2019 the fe 300 biochar loaded with p adsorbed from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate mlm solution and bacteria suspension were added into the 250 ml conical flasks the flasks were incubated at 37 1 c with shaking at 150 rpm samples were taken at time intervals and exposed for analyses of the concentrations of tp and orthophosphate ortho p the amount of pyrophosphate pyro p according to qian et al 2019 2 6 model description the removal efficiency r and adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe

analytical methods the concentration of dissolved ortho phosphate was measured by the phosphomolybdate colorimetric assay using a uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan while the measurement of total p was performed after peroxodisulfate digestion and the molybdenum blue complex can be formed subsequently which was then measured by the phosphomolybdate colorimetric assay using the same uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan murphy and riley 1962 other analytical methods please refer to text s1 of the supporting information for measurements of the related p species the characteristics zeta potential ph functionalities morphology etc of biochar before and after p adsorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar 3 1 1 the ph value yield specific surface area and zeta potential the characteristics of biochars produced at various temperatures are summarized in table 1 e g the yield rate and surface area of biochar as well as ph value and zeta potential of the leaching solution of biochar the increased pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 900 c contributed to the decreased yield rates of the rs biochar and iron rich biochar from 74 41 wt to 56 29 wt and 77 74 wt to 54 44 wt respectively this can be related to the gradual volatilization of the organic substances with the removal of oxygenated functional groups e g hydroxyl carboxylic and carbonyl groups in sludge tan et al 2014 the highest specific surface areas were obtained at 700 c for biochar pyrolyzed from rs 16 61 m2 g 1 and of 700 c for biochar pyrolyzed from iron rich sludge 59 04 m2 g 1 meanwhile the leaching solution of biochar was acidic when produced at a lower treatment temperature but shifting to alkaline at 500 c onwards this might be due to the decomposition of organic acid and carbonate during the pyrolysis process hence the alkalinity of biochar became stronger at higher pyrolysis temperatures yuan et al 2011 moreover the zeta potential of the leaching solution of biochar samples pyrolyzed at higher temperatures of 500 900 c became more negative than those pyrolyzed at lower temperatures e g 300 c causing them difficult to adsorb the negatively charged po4 3 due to the electrostatic interactions more information about the contents of main metal elements can be found in text s2 of the supporting information 3 1 2 ftir ftir spectra of biochars derived from both the rs sludge and the iron rich sludge pyrolyzed at different temperatures 300 900 c are shown in fig s2 supporting information the fe o bond at 580 cm 1 can be observed in both the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar possibly due to the indigenous iron existed in waste activated sludge and the extra added fenton s reagent for the aliphatic ch2 bond at 2921 cm 1 2849 cm 1 and 1447 cm 1 it can be observed in both the rs 300 biochar and the fe 300 biochar however it disappeared as the pyrolysis temperature increased above 300 c which may be attributed to the decomposition of organic compounds e g lipid containing the aliphatic ch2 bond 3 2 comparison of tp removal efficiencies of the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar tp removal efficiencies from the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate by the rs biochar and the iron rich biochar pyrolyzed at various temperatures are shown in fig 1 for the rs biochar the rs 700 biochar showed the highest tp removal efficiencies of 45 for the kh2po4 solution fig 1a and up to 65 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fig 1b respectively increased tp removal efficiencies were noted for both the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 to 700 c possibly due to the increased specific surface areas of rs biochar samples as the pyrolysis temperature increased up till 700 c table 1 which can be related to the accelerated carbonization degree wang et al 2019 at the pyrolysis temperature of 800 c indiscernible increases in the tp removal efficiencies were noted for the rs biochar in both the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate which can be related to the indiscernible changes of surface area at the pyrolysis temperature of 800 c table 1 while continuously increasing the pyrolysis temperature up to 900 c the tp removal efficiencies decreased for both the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate considering the decreased surface areas at the pyrolysis of 900 c table 1 it can be deduced that the pyrolysis temperature above 800 c may destroy the pore walls between adjacent pores and pores may be restrained accordingly zou et al 2013 interestingly it is noted that the rs biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c showed negative tp removal efficiency towards the kh2po4 solution the rs 300 biochar may not adsorb phosphorus but release it instead and the release degree may exceed the adsorption degree supporting information fig s3 however it shows the different trend for the iron rich biochar despite its higher specific surface area at the increased pyrolysis temperature of 500 800 c table 1 it is noted that the iron rich biochar derived from iron rich sludge at a lower temperature of 300 c the fe 300 biochar showed the highest tp removal efficiency for both the kh2po4 solution 84 fig 1a and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate 66 fig 1b considering the relatively lower surface area of the fe 300 biochar and its better adsorption efficiency it can be deduced that the p adsorption by the fe 300 biochar may be not determined by the physical adsorption alone since a high abundance of fe element total iron content of 84 37 mg g 1ds existed in the fe biochar supporting information table s2 it is hypothesized that the chemical reactions between fe species and p may also contribute to the higher tp adsorption efficiency which shall be discussed later moreover for the fe 500 fe 700 fe 800 and fe 900 biochars due to more negative charges on their surfaces as discussed above table 1 it may be difficult for them to adsorb the negatively charged po4 3 due to the electrostatic repulsive interactions furthermore a series of phase transformations of the iron containing phases in iron rich sludge could take place during sludge pyrolysis in this study the fe ii and fe iii species were predominant in biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c which would be further reduced into zero valent iron fe0 under the reducing gases of carbon monoxide and hydrogen during sludge pyrolysis at higher temperature of 800 900 c as found in our previous studies tao et al 2019 as is known zero valent iron showed less adsorption capability towards p than fe ii and fe iii species eljamal et al 2016 khalil et al 2017 hence it can be concluded that the chemical adsorptions towards p by biochars derived at 500 900 c were less than that of biochar derived at 300 c comparing the tp removal efficiencies of both the fe biochar and the rs biochar it is noted that the highest tp removal efficiency was achieved by the fe 300 biochar in both the kh2po4 solution 84 and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate 66 thus the fe 300 biochar was chosen as the representative one for the subsequent adsorption and desorption experiments 3 3 adsorption and desorption mechanisms 3 3 1 the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of p by the fe 300 biochar for the kh2po4 solution and liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fig 2 a shows that the amounts of p adsorbed by the fe 300 biochar increased rapidly at the early stage while a slower adsorption rate was observed as the adsorption process proceeded possibly due to the decrease of active adsorption sties yang et al 2018 two adsorption kinetic models were used to evaluate p adsorption kinetics by the fe 300 biochar the results indicated that the pseudo second order model was more suitable to describe the interaction between p in the kh2po4 solution and fe element existed in the iron rich biochar due to its relatively higher r2 than the pseudo first order model 0 992 versus 0 976 these results indicated that chemisorption mechanism may be involved in the adsorption of phosphorus by the fe 300 biochar yoon et al 2014 to study the adsorption isotherms two widely used isotherms models freundlich and langmuir models were used to fit the experimental data and the fitted parameters are presented in fig 2b as can be seen freundlich adsorption parameter kf was 1 369 mg g 1 which was lower than the actual capacity of 2 628 mg g 1 fig 2b in contrast qm of 2 643 mg g 1 fitted from the langmuir isotherms fitted well with the experimental data of 2 628 mg g 1 fig 2b moreover the langmuir model owns a higher r2 value than the freundlich model 0 986 versus 0 936 the well fitted langmuir model indicated that p adsorption by the fe 300 biochar may follow a monolayer adsorption process ifthikar et al 2017 considering the hypothesized physical sorption chemical precipitation mechanism for fe 300 biochar as discussed in section 3 2 the p adsorption on the fe 300 biochar was further evaluated by a dual langmuir langmuir model which can describe the metal adsorption process e g surface adsorption precipitation and complexation das et al 2007 it is noted that p adsorption can be better fitted to the langmuir langmuir model than the langmuir model alone with a higher r2 value 0 989 versus 0 986 and qp the precipitation amount per unit mass of the fe 300 biochar was higher than qa the adsorption amount per unit mass of the fe 300 biochar in the langmuir langmuir model fig 2c it can be deduced that chemical precipitation was mainly responsible for p retention by the fe element existed on the surface of fe 300 biochar 70 calculated from qp divided by the summation of qa and qp the remaining 30 qa divided by the summation of qa and qp can be related with physical adsorption possibly via complexation of p with surface functional group which shall be discussed later text s3 and fig s4 supporting information show details of the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of the fe 300 biochar for p adsorption in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and similar adsorption kinetics can be obtained in comparison with p adsorption in the kh2po4 solution interestingly it is noted that the maximum phosphorus adsorption capability of the fe 300 biochar was higher for the kh2po4 solution 2 628 mg g 1 fig 2b than for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate 1 843 mg g 1 fig s4b as shown in fig s4c the langmuir langmuir model failed to fit the data the presence of anion ions such as cl hco3 and no3 in actual liquid phase of anaerobic digestate may potentially interfere with the adsorption of p suggesting that the langmuir langmuir model was more suitable for the pure solution rather than the complex liquid phase of anaerobic digestate the results of fig s5 indicated that with the presence of hco3 the p adsorption capability significantly decreased with the difference significant p 0 05 indicating that hco3 may compete with p for adsorption sites on biochar yang et al 2018 however cl and no3 showed indiscernible effects on the p adsorption with the difference was insignificant p 0 05 this may be because the adsorption of cl and no3 belonged to non specific adsorption and the outer sphere complexes may be formed thus not interfering with p adsorption loganathan et al 2014 as summarized in table s3 supporting information the adsorption capacities towards p of biochars derived from various substrates were different in fact the adsorption capacity of biochar towards p was strongly dependent on the amount of chemically available iron on biochar moreover as can be seen the kh2po4 solution was commonly used as the simulated adsorbate in most of previous studies in this study the iron rich biochar fe 300 biochar adsorbed with p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate might be used as a p fertilizer which shall be investigated in the following study 3 3 2 phosphorus desorption of fe 300 biochar the p desorption of the fe 300 biochar was conducted to evaluate its recycling and regeneration performance for p removal efficiency it is noted that there were indiscernible changes of p adsorption capability of fe 300 biochar after 5 successive adsorption desorption cycles with the final desorption efficiency of still more than 97 of the adsorption capacity at the fifth cycle fig 1c these results suggested that the fe 300 biochar pyrolyzed in this study exhibited superior stability of adsorption desorption cycles and may be potentially used to reclaim p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate however it is also noted that the desorption efficiency failed to reach 100 indicating that p on the adsorbent was not completely reversible and the bonding force between the iron and phosphorus may be strong zeng et al 2004 for the adsorption process at low ph values less than ph 4 p can be protonated mainly as h2po4 or hpo4 2 du et al 2016 these protonated p species were not effectively adsorbed by the positively charged fe ions of the fe 300 biochar due to the completion of hydrogen ion and fe ii fe iii ions for adsorption sites zhou et al 2005 the adsorption capacity of p by the fe 300 biochar increased while further increasing ph to 4 00 due to the ion exchange between p and hydroxyl ions and it was stabilized while continuously increasing the ph values till ph of 11 00 liao et al 2019 for the desorption process as the ph values increased the p desorption efficiencies increased since the hydroxyl ion might compete with p species for surface sites more p species could be desorbed in this study for the adsorption process the ph values of all solutions added with biochars synthesized at 300 900 c for both the kh2po4 solution and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate were in the range of 5 50 8 11 within this range the p adsorption capacity by the fe 300 biochar remains the same regardless of the fluctuations of ph values as shown in fig s6 in supporting information as for the desorption process 0 25 mol l 1 naoh solution was used as the desorption reagent after each desorption the biochar was washed with ultrapure water firstly till the ph of the elute solution was close to neutral prior to the next sorption desorption cycle hence the ph fluctuations may also show indiscernible effects on the sorption desorption cycle 3 4 p species before and after the adsorption of the fe 300 biochar the liquid 31p nmr spectroscopy was used to compare p species before and after the adsorption of the fe 300 biochar shown in fig s7 as can be seen the predominant p species in the fe 300 biochar before adsorption were inorganic p namely ortho p and pyro p the results of huang and tang 2015 supported this finding that p species shifted to inorganic p mainly ortho p and pyro p due to the decomposition of the long chain polyphosphate during the pyrolysis process after adsorbing p in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fe 300 ad although no new p species appeared the p peak intensities of both ortho p and pyro p in the fe 300 ad biochar p were higher than those of the original fe 300 biochar before adsorption supporting information table s4 in association with the large amount of inorganic p content existed 94 79 in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate supporting information table s5 which has been reported to be predominant in forms of ortho p and pyro p smith et al 2006 it is therefore deduced that the fe 300 biochar may be effective in adsorbing inorganic p e g ortho p and pyro p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate 3 5 the adsorption mechanism of p with the fe 300 biochar fig 3 shows the xrd patterns of the fe 300 biochar before and after p adsorption for the kh2po4 solution compared with the fe 300 biochar before p adsorption it is noted that the xrd pattern of fe 300 kh2po4 showed a strong signal of new fe p crystal in form of iron hydrogen phosphate after p adsorption from the kh2po4 solution fig 3 and the solution ph values before and after the adsorption process were 5 50 and 4 44 respectively the p species predominated as h2po4 at this ph range which may interact with the released fe i e fe ii and fe iii to form the iron hydrogen phosphate compared with that before adsorption fig s8a the sem results indicated that more appearance of small particles was observed after the adsorption of p by the fe 300 biochar figs s8b c the energy dispersive spectrometry eds spectra indicated that the main elements of the fe 300 biochar were determined to be c o si al fe and p fig s8d confirming the formation of iron hydrogen phosphate on the surface of the fe 300 biochar similar results can be obtained using the fe 300 biochar to adsorb p in the kh2po4 solution figs s8e g to further study the interaction between fe 300 biochar and p the xps spectra of fe 2p and p 2p were evaluated based on the assigned binding energies at 729 5 ev for fe ii and 724 8 ev for fe iii xu et al 2016 the predominant fe species in the fe 300 biochar before adsorption fe 300 after p adsorption for the kh2po4 solution fe 300 kh2po4 and the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate fe 300 ad were all fe ii and fe iii fig 4 a c these fe species i e fe ii and fe iii may possibly contribute to the chemical precipitation between fe and p as mentioned above figs 2 and 3 and s8 after p adsorption the presence of p is noted in all these samples at the binding energy of 133 40 v fig 4e and f it is noted that percentage of the normalized p peak area increased in fe 300 kh2po4 and fe 300 ad than that in fe 300 indicating the shift of p from the liquid phase to the biochar samples fig 4e and f 3 6 grass seed germination rate and early stage seedling growth further to confirming the feasibility of p adsorbed biochars as a prospective p fertilizer pot experiments were performed fig 5 the seed germination rate increased from 66 blank group to 96 and 92 with the addition of respective fe 300 kh2po4 and fe 300 ad p adsorbed biochars fig 5a after 10 days growth lengths of the grass shoot in samples with p adsorbed fe 300 kh2po4 and fe 300 ad were longer than other groups of control rs 300 and fe 300 fig 5b and c these results can be supported by the results of yao et al 2013 that the presence of phosphorus not only improved the seed germination rate but also enhanced seedling growth moreover it is worth noting that iron hydrogen phosphate identified in iron rich biochar was insoluble which might reduce their plant availability it is highly possible that p available for seed germination rate and early stage growth was mainly from the surface adsorption through physical adsorption 3 7 the solubilization of p adsorbed by fe 300 biochar the by p aeruginosa as mentioned above 70 of p was adsorbed through a chemical reaction by fe 300 biochar in form of iron hydrogen phosphate fig 2 which is insoluble thus affecting their availability for plant utilization as the phosphate solubilizing microorganism was capable to solubilize fe p minerals and increase p plant availability chuang et al 2007 hence their capability to solubilize the chemically adsorbed p was studied herein after an incubation of 20 days the total amount of p solubilized from fe 300 ad biochar was up to 3 045 mg g 1 fig 6 as mentioned above the maximum p adsorption capacity of fe 300 biochar was up to 1 843 mg g 1 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate the p released from the fe 300 ad biochar was consisted of p adsorbed from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and p existed in the fe 300 biochar 2 232 mg g 1 water soluble p and 20 088 mg g 1 fe p xiao et al 2019 for p adsorbed from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate theoretically 0 553 mg g 1 was adsorbed by a physical reaction basing on a 30 ratio 1 843 0 3 0 553 mg g 1 and 1 290 mg g 1 was adsorbed by a chemical reaction basing on a 70 ratio 1 843 0 7 1 290 mg g 1 even if all the water soluble p and p adsorbed by a physical reaction were released into the liquid phase it is noted that these partial of p 0 553 2 232 2 785 mg g 1 was less than 3 045 mg g 1 fig 6 from these calculations it can be deduced that p in form of fe p either sourced from fe p in the fe 300 biochar or from the indigenous p adsorbed by a chemical reaction from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate must have been be released into the liquid phase to further investigate the species of p released from the fe 300 ad biochar incubated with p aeruginosa the concentrations of different p species in the liquid before and after an incubation of 20 days are shown in fig s9 supporting information the concentrations of ortho p and pyro p increased for the fe 300 ad biochar incubated with p aeruginosa after an incubation of 20 days ortho p 0 79 mg g 1 versus 0 04 mg g 1 pyro p 2 26 mg g 1 versus 0 07 mg g 1 these results indicated that the p aeruginosa can promote the release of both ortho p and pyro p from biochar into the liquid phase which may promote plant growth 3 8 a potential p fertilizer using biochar derived from iron rich sludge for p adsorption from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate in this study a sustainable sludge recycling strategy and p recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate was developed by using sludge derived iron rich biochar pyrolyzed at a low temperature of 300 c fig 7 the fe 300 biochar showed a maximum p adsorption capacity of up to 1 843 mg g 1 for the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and 70 p was precipitated through chemical reaction with fe element existed on the surface of the fe 300 biochar and other 30 was through surface physical adsorption most of p adsorbed by the iron rich biochar was plant available and the seed germination rate was increased up to 92 with the addition of fe 300 biochar after adsorbing most of p compared with 66 without the addition of biochar moreover p adsorbed by chemical reaction in form of iron hydrogen phosphate can be solubilized by a phosphate solubilizing microorganism of p aeruginosa with the total solubilized p amount of 3 045 mg g 1 at the end of an incubation of 20 days therefore the sustainable sludge recycling system proposed in this study would provide a promising prospect for both sludge treatment in wwtps and p recovery from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate thus showing significant environmental benefits the conversion of wasted iron rich sludge to useful product as phosphate adsorbent meets the requirements of circular economy 4 conclusions the feasibility of using iron rich biochar derived from iron rich sludge to adsorb p from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate was investigated the main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the fe 300 biochar pyrolyzed from iron rich sludge at a low temperature of 300 c showed better tp removal efficiency than the biochars pyrolyzed at other higher temperatures of 500 900 c 2 the fe 300 biochar showed a maximum p adsorption capacity of 1 843 mg g 1 for p reclamation in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate and most of orthophosphate and pyrophosphate in the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate can be removed 3 the p adsorption process was comprised of 70 p precipitation through chemical reaction with fe ii and fe iii elements existed on the surface of iron rich biochar and 30 surface physical adsorption 4 most of the p retained in the iron rich biochar was bioavailable and could stimulate seed germination rate of up to 92 compared with the control group of 66 without any biochar addition 5 p aeruginosa can solubilize p adsorbed by a chemical reaction and then promoting the release of both ortho p and pyro p into the liquid phase declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18068,natural organic matter nom can inhibit the photocatalytic degradation of organic micropollutants omps through inner filter effect reactive oxygen species ros scavenging and competitive adsorption however previous studies have focused solely on the bulk properties of nom and our understanding of the inhibition mechanism by nom fractions during photocatalytic degradation of omp is still fragmentary in this study five well characterized different nom samples i e secondary treated wastewater river water and three standard nom surrogates were used to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms during photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine a model omp using tio2 and its composites with carbon nanotubes cnt tio2 under uvc and solar light irradiation the results indicated that terrestrially derived nom with high aromaticity a low oxygen carbon atom ratio and large molecular weight is the major fraction that participates in ros scavenging competitive adsorption and inner filter effect furthermore the modeling analysis suggested that inner filter effect due to nom and ros scavenging was the most influential inhibitory mechanism in the case of secondary treated wastewater the presence of high concentrations of inorganic species e g po4 3 cl and no3 together with nom significantly reduced the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine overall the methods and the results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of nom fractions on photocatalysis and highlight the need to further consider the interplay between nom and background

2016 zouzelka et al 2016 moreover among various carbonaceous materials cnt showed to be the most promising supporting material due to high mechanical strength high thermal stability and potential use of inherently magnetic property for recovery from the solution apul et al 2013 apul and karanfil 2015 ateia et al 2017b ersan et al 2017 also natural organic matter nom such as humic substances is ubiquitous in natural and engineered waters and influences the performance of photocatalysts for the removal of omps for instance low nom concentrations i e 0 5 mg c l 1 in water showed enhancement of the photodegradation rate of carbamazepine by creating attraction sites on the tio2 particles however adverse effects at higher nom concentrations i e 0 5 mg c l 1 were observed brame et al 2015 drosos et al 2015 li and hu 2018 ren et al 2018 ye et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 these studies indicated the importance of inhibition mechanisms by nom for the removal of omps in water and or wastewater from treatment plants where the typical organic concentrations in the water supply and wastewater are more than 0 5 mg c l 1 ahmadi et al 2016 raeke et al 2017 previous studies have reported that nom interferes with photocatalytic degradation via inner filter effect radical scavenging and competition between nom and target omps over the active sorption sites first the presence of nom in water acts as an inner filter which would decrease the availability of light i e energy to produce reactive oxygen species ros ye et al 2019 second in the context of photodegradation the nom can reduce the interaction of targeted contaminants close to the catalysts active site i e competitive adsorption ren et al 2018 third the nom can react with the ros due to the non selective nature of the ros and reduce the effectiveness of the ros in the photodegradation process michael kordatou et al 2015 among those inhibition mechanisms brame et al 2015 stated that ros scavenging and competitive adsorption by nom were the most influential inhibitory mechanisms in a tio2 slurry system yet our understanding of the effect of nom fractions and their compositions on the photocatalytic degradation of omp is still fragmentary the limited observations in previous studies table s1 are due to a number of critical factors 1 most of the studies used high omp concentrations up to 10 mg l which are atypical of environmental concentrations 2 these studies are not necessarily comparable because only a few nom types were tested and there were differences in experimental conditions 3 most of the previous studies focused on the bulk properties of the background nom i e dissolved organic carbon doc during the omp photocatalysis 4 the light source varied among studies i e uvc and solar irradiation 5 almost all of the studies focused on tio2 as a photocatalyst and no studies examined the effect of nom on the photocatalysis of omp by carbonaceous composites of tio2 and 6 the studies used only nom surrogates despite the greater accuracy assessing the inhibition mechanism of nom in real water samples therefore there is still a need for improved understanding of the photocatalysis of omp by tio2 and its carbonaceous composites in the presence of nom to adequately assess the potential engineering applications herein we considered such limitations in the literature and designed this study to elucidate the effects of nom on the photocatalytic degradation of omp using tio2 and cnt tio2 cnt tio2 was chosen as one modified form of carbonaceous tio2 catalysts that attracted a lot of attention for environmental application while tio2 was used as a benchmark photocatalyst to this end the overall objective was to systematically investigate the photocatalytic behavior of carbamazepine as a selected omp in the presence of three nom surrogates i e reverse osmosis isolate nom humic acid and fulvic acid by performing kinetic experiments and using a set of nom characterization techniques i e doc fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy to document the characteristics and fate of background nom during the photocatalysis process i e under uvc and solar irradiation furthermore secondary treated wastewater and river water were used to accurately assessed the inhibition mechanism of nom in real water samples the specific objectives of research were 1 to reveal the relationship between the nom properties and the photocatalytic degradation rate of carbamazepine 2 to reveal the role of nom in the inhibition mechanisms and 3 to determine the relative importance of the inhibition mechanisms i e ros scavenging inner filter effect and competitive adsorption in cnt tio2 systems based on inhibition model analysis and comparison to tio2 system we focused on the degradation of carbamazepine an

received a stock solution of 10 mg l 1 carbamazepine was prepared in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 1 the nom samples were dissolved in 0 01 m naoh solution to prepare a 10 g l 1 nom stock solution and then the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 using 0 1 1 m hcl solutions the volumes of acid and alkali solutions were recorded and considered when calculating the final nom concentration all stock solutions were stored at 4 c in the dark when not in use and the desired concentrations were obtained by diluting the stock solutions with ultrapure water a secondary treated wastewater sww sample was collected in february 2019 after secondary treatment activated sludge and secondary clarifier at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in tokyo japan water from the tama river rw was collected at latitude 35 35 n and longitude 139 40 e about 13 km from the mouth of the river in april 2019 after collection the sww and rw were filtered with a 0 45 μm ptfe membrane filter omnipore jhwp 47 mm diameter and were poured into pre rinsed amber glass bottles 3 l and stored in a refrigerator 4 c the water quality characteristics of the rw and sww are summarized in table s3 the ph of the water samples was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 under temperature controlled laboratory conditions prior to performing the photocatalysis experiments 2 2 photocatalytic degradation experiments in this study tio2 and cnt tio2 composites were used as the catalysts the detailed preparation and characterization of all catalysts are described in section s1 in the supporting information photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted in 100 ml aqueous solution in a 200 ml glass beaker a magnetic stirrer was used to ensure homogeneous mixing of the catalysts in the solutions solutions were prepared having initial concentrations of 500 μg l 1 for carbamazepine and 3 mg c l 1 for dissolved organic carbon as either srnom srfa or srha the concentrations of carbamazepine and the doc values of the nom were determined based on reported average concentrations in the surface water and in the secondary treated domestic wastewater carbonaro et al 2013 cardoso et al 2014 raeke et al 2017 the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to 7 0 0 2 with 0 01 m hcl and naoh the concentration of tio2 and cnt tio2 was 0 1 g l 1 the water temperature was kept constant at room temperature 26 3 c an 8w uvc lamp glk8mq sankyo denki japan was installed to provide ultraviolet radiation with λ 254 nm and light intensity 80 w m 2 in the case of solar irradiation a solar simulator ms 35aaa ushio lighting edge technologies japan with light intensity of 1000 w m 2 was used as a light source lee et al 2017b for all experiments prior to irradiation the suspension was stirred in the dark for 60 min to allow an adsorption equilibrium of carbamazepine to be established on the catalyst surface it was confirmed that additional stirring for 120 min resulted in no further adsorption of carbamazepine during irradiation an aliquot 50 ml of slurry was withdrawn after 5 10 15 20 and 30 min respectively blank experiments in ultrapure water and also without catalysts were conducted to test the photocatalysis in the absence of nom and photolysis all the experiments were performed in duplicate moreover to elucidate the main oxidizing agents produced by the cnt tio2 system isopropanol oh quencher and sodium oxalate h quencher were employed in the photocatalysis process i e in ultrapure water zhang et al 2018a the effect of water matrices was evaluated by spiking carbamazepine into sww and rw 500 μg l 1 followed by photocatalytic degradation using cnt tio2 under uvc irradiation one 8w uvc lamp λmax 254 nm light intensity 80 w m 2 glk8mq sankyo denki uvc was used as the source of the light irradiation due to the higher energy i e higher photocatalytic activity as a control experiment 500 μg l 1 of carbamazepine was also spiked into the srnom and compared alongside the sww and rw the srnom was selected because its nom property is similar to that of the sww and the rw in terms of fluorescence index fi values and a uvc lamp was used as an irradiation source considering the high energy of this source which would favor the production of radicals the experiments were performed under the same operating conditions examined for ultrapure water spiked with nom standards i e srnom srfa and srha the detailed analytical procedures i e hplc lc ms ms ic toc uv and fluorescence are described in section s2 the photocatalytic activity of the tio2 and cnt tio2 are described using a pseudo first

order rate constant min 1 and t is the time min 2 3 model application the nom inhibition model brame et al 2015 eqs 2 7 for photocatalytic degradation was applied to elucidate the nom inhibition mechanism i e ros scavenging competitive adsorption and inner filter effect in the experiment the results from photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine under solar irradiation in the presence of the srnom were chosen due to the availability of relevant parameters in the literature and the similar nom characteristics to sww and rw 2 dc a dt non k a c a c ros s 1 1 k a c a d k a 1 k a c a 3 c

were taken from the literature sources for identical cnts and modified accordingly with the specific surface area for the cnt tio2 used in this work the degradation rate for carbamazepine removal in the absence and presence of nom dca dt non and dca dt inhibit respectively ca and cn were measured from the experiments some data were used for validation the production of ros in the absence of nom

mechanism for nom inhibition brame et al 2015 the point of elasticity is defined as the percent change in the dependent variable i e carbamazepine degradation rate divided by the percent change in an independent variable the ka kn ka kn and μl parameters are the major independent variables in the inhibition model which can describe the competitive adsorption ros scavenging and inner filter effect respectively brame et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the morphology of the cnt tio2 revealed that tio2 clusters were attached on the surface of the cnt sem image fig s1 which was further confirmed by tem edx analysis figs s2 and s3 the surface area the total pore volume and the pore distribution of the samples are listed in table 1 the specific surface area of the cnt tio2 was three times higher than that of the tio2 furthermore the cnt tio2 showed a narrower bandgap in visible light region 2 8 ev 440 nm than that of the tio2 3 3 ev 376 nm fig s4 which suggested that cnt tio2 may function as a superior photocatalytic material and may be active under both solar and uv irradiation the crystalline property of tio2 and the prepared cnt tio2 was confirmed by xrd analysis fig s5 the diffraction peak of tio2 consisted of anatase main diffraction peak at 2θ 25 3 and rutile main diffraction peak at 2θ 27 4 tio2 peaks the cnt tio2 had four main diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 and 43 which were attributed to the cnt graphite like structure and at 2θ 25 3 and 27 4 which were attributed to anatase and rutile tio2 peaks respectively more details on the characterization of the cnt tio2 are available in a previous report awfa et al 2019 3 2 photolysis and photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine photolysis of carbamazepine by uvc and solar irradiation was well fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model fig s6 direct photolysis of carbamazepine under uvc and solar irradiation showed very low removal 5 with photolysis rate constants k carbamazepine of 5 1 10 4 min 1 and 4 0 7 10 4 min 1 during uvc and solar irradiation respectively the amide bonds in carbamazepine make it highly resistant to uvc deng et al 2013 in the case of direct photolysis under solar irradiation carbamazepine does not have functional groups that absorb radiation 290 nm i e corresponding to the main solar irradiation spectrum wang et al 2017 during photocatalysis carbamazepine was rapidly degraded with k carbamazepine values of 4 75 0 07 10 2 min 1 uvc tio2 7 0 0 08 10 2 min 1 uvc cnt tio2 3 95 0 07 10 2 min 1 solar tio2 and 5 5 0 06 10 2 min 1 solar cnt tio2 as shown in fig 1 given that direct photolysis was negligible it is evident that the removal of carbamazepine was due mainly to its reaction with radicals produced by photocatalysis the participation of radicals in carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation was then clarified by the addition of isopropanol ip as a scavenger for oh and sodium oxalate so as a scavenger of h as shown in fig 1 the addition of ip and so resulted in the inhibition of carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation suggesting that both oh and h participated in the photocatalysis of carbamazepine by tio2 and cnt tio2 in general the photocatalytic activity i e k of cnt tio2 was higher than tio2 because 1 the excited cnt can inject electrons into tio2 which increases the photocurrent woan et al 2009 2 the excitation electron from cnt can combine with dissolved o2 to form superoxide woan et al 2009 and 3 cnt provides suitable sites for the sorption of contaminants which act as an electron sink and facilitates visible light absorption due to the ti o c linkage i e bandgap reduction awfa et al 2019 furthermore uvc photocatalysis showed higher k carbamazepine values than solar irradiation because the shorter wavelength i e uvc is associated with a greater photon energy that can promote electrons to the conduction band with high kinetic energy phong and hur 2016 3 3 photolysis and photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in the presence of different nom surrogates the nom inhibition mechanisms the addition of three different nom surrogates inhibited the carbamazepine photolysis under uvc and solar irradiation fig 2 these inhibitions of carbamazepine photolysis were due presumably to inner filter effect of the srnom the srfa and the srha lee et al 2014 both the srfa and the srha with higher aromatic content i e high suva254 value exhibited more inhibition than the srnom for the photolysis of carbamazepine apparently the nom with high aromatic content can intercept the light transmission and also increase the energy consumption from uvc and solar irradiation guerard et al 2009 furthermore the inhibitory effect of nom on photocatalysis may also be due to the surface deactivation of tio2 and cnt tio2 by adsorption and or radical scavenging brame et al 2015 the adsorbed nom was capable of reducing the interaction of carbamazepine close to the catalyst active sites for the photodegradation process i e competitive adsorption and nom can also scavenge the holes h in the catalyst valence band ren et al 2018 as indicated in fig s7 the competitive adsorption of nom reduced the adsorption capacity of carbamazepine onto cnt tio2 in the order srha srfa srnom the difference in this competitive adsorption can be attributed to the higher aromaticity of the srha as indicated by the suva254 value ateia et al 2017a the presence of the cnt provided a high surface area with hydrophobic sites in the cnt tio2 composite however in the case of tio2 alone the presence of nom had a minimal effect on the adsorption of carbamazepine on tio2 implying that there was no competitive adsorption between carbamazepine and nom this is apparently due to the surface hydrophilicity and limited surface area of tio2 yang and xing 2009 yuan et al 2018 thus the inhibitory effect of nom was attributed mainly to inner filter effect and the radical scavenging for tio2 however in the case of cnt tio2 competitive adsorption together with inner filter effect and radical scavenging were responsible for the mechanism of nom inhibition in photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine the role of nom composition the addition of the nom surrogates negatively affected the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine by tio2 and cnt tio2 under uvc and solar irradiation fig 3 and fig s8 which is consistent with previous studies doll and frimmel 2005 haroune et al 2014 the degree of inhibition of carbamazepine photocatalysis by different nom surrogates followed the order srha srfa srnom implying the dependence of the carbamazepine photocatalysis degradation rate on the nom characteristics nom interferes with the photocatalytic mechanisms via inner filter effect radical scavenging and adsorbed nom competes for active sites with the targeted omp despite the lower photodegradation rate in the presence of nom the reduction in the photodegradation rate of cnt tio2 i e 50 80 inhibition was less than that of tio2 i e 55 90 for both uvc and solar irradiation perhaps due to the fact that the high surface area of the composite provided sufficient active sites for the photocatalytic degradation on cnt tio2 in contrast to that for tio2 awfa et al 2019 the changes in doc during photocatalytic degradation are described in section s3 in the supporting information in addition five excitation emission matrix eem peaks having different excitation emission pairs were investigated to understand the effects of several nom fractions with different sources and relative size variations on the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine table 2 adsorption of nom peaks onto tio2 and cnt tio2 were in the order peak c m a t b fig s9 this order can be explained by the linkage of the terrestrial humic like component with larger and more hydrophobic nom fractions which typically have a higher adsorption affinity on the catalysts zhao et al 2018 irrespective of the nom fractions the adsorption onto cnt tio2 was higher than onto tio2 because cnt tio2 is hydrophobic and has a higher specific surface area in the case of photolysis fig s10 the highest photolysis degradation of the nom fraction was peak t with an excitation wavelength at 275 nm under uvc irradiation uvc irradiation λmax 254 nm in contrast the nom fraction degradation under solar irradiation solar irradiation λmax 550 nm was in the order c m a t b these results were consistent with previous photolysis studies using uvc irradiation phong and hur 2016 and solar irradiation moran et al 2000 the highest removal of nom fractions was found when the excitation peak wavelengths were close to the maximum irradiation wavelength followed by those with longer to shorter peak excitation wavelengths del vecchio and blough 2002 for photocatalytic degradation the order of the nom photocatalytic degradation rate k nom was peak c m a t b for both tio2 and cnt tio2 under uvc and solar irradiation fig 4 a previous study indicated that the different degradation behaviors of the nom peaks can be explained by the catalyst associated reaction pathways phong and hur 2015 the nom peak that was adsorbed or adhered to the catalyst s surface was likely to be more preferably degraded by hydroxyl radicals and or react with holes h leading to the highest degradation therefore it was presumed that peak c gives the highest k carbamazepine inhibition in carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation previous studies reported that the fluorescence index fi can be a superior indicator for investigation of the changes of nom during several water treatment processes such as photocatalysis bekbolet and sen kavurmaci 2015 photocatalytic disinfection birben et al 2017 ozonation rodríguez et al 2014 and adsorption ateia et al 2017a in this study the fi values were calculated to evaluate the preferential removal of nom fractions during carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation as shown in table s2 the fi values for the samples i e before photocatalysis indicated that the srha and the srfa were more likely to be terrestrial derived nom fi 1 2 however the srnom shared the characteristics of both terrestrial and microbial aquatic nom 1 2 fi 1 8 as illustrated in fig 5 the fi values of all nom samples increased after photocatalysis under uvc and solar irradiation fi 1 2 this indicated the preferential photocatalytic degradation of terrestrially derived compounds previous studies tested the same standard nom samples reporting that terrestrially derived nom is rich in aromatic moieties ateia et al 2017a and has a high average molecular weight shimabuku et al 2017 fi is related to the source of nom thus the increase of the fi values further suggests that terrestrially derived nom i e nom fractions with high molecular weight and high aromatic moieties were preferentially removed during the photocatalytic degradation further analysis of the results indicated that k carbamazepine had correlations with the o c ratio suva254 and fi and the degradation rate of peak c fig 6 also nom with lower o c ratios tended to have a higher inhibition in carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation fig 6a lower o c ratios implied the nom contained fewer oxygenic groups especially carbonyl and or carboxylic groups a similar trend was previously observed for the preferential degradation of nom with low o c ratio by tio2 lv et al 2017 in addition terrestrially derived nom low fi value with high aromaticity high suva254 value exhibited higher inhibition of k carbamazepine fig 6b and c which is in agreement with fig 6d where higher degradation rates for peak c terrestrial humic like and high molecular weight components of nom led to a decrease in k carbamazepine 3 4 the relative importance of each inhibition mechanism in the photocatalytic degradation the previous study indicated that the inhibition model gave a reasonable prediction r2 0 88 for the photocatalytic degradation of the omp in the presence of background nom with tio2 under uva irradiation and the relative importance of nom inhibition followed the order ros scavenging competitive adsorption inner filter effect brame et al 2015 therefore the existing inhibition model could also be useful for explaining the role of each nom inhibition mechanism in the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine using cnt tio2 in this study the model predicted the degradation rates of carbamazepine using cnt tio2 with a high degree of accuracy r2 0 8 rmse 0 0005 mg l 1 min 1 fig s11 this result validated the existing nom inhibition model and showed its capability to predict degradation of omps in water containing nom using cnt tio2 under solar light irradiation as shown in fig 7 the relative importance of the nom inhibition mechanism in cnt tio2 photocatalysis followed the order ros scavenging inner filter effect competitive adsorption this finding was contrary to the previous study conducted by brame et al 2015 where competitive adsorption was found to be relatively more important than inner filter effect in the case of tio2 this inhibitory effect depends significantly on the physicochemical properties of the target compound the catalyst and the quality and quantity of nom despite the fact that a similar nom i e srnom was used it should be noted that the previous study involved tio2 while in this study cnt tio2 was used as the photocatalyst the high surface area of the cnt tio2 unlike tio2 provided sufficient active sites for the adsorption therefore the difference in the catalyst properties affected the relative order of inner filter effect and competitive adsorption yet the role played by nom as a ros scavenging still provided the most important inhibition mechanism in the photocatalytic degradation of omp for both tio2 and cnt tio2 furthermore a change of nom property would also affect the cnt tio2 photocatalysis in the case of nom with higher aromaticity and molecular weight there would be an increase in the values of kn i e decrement of ka kn k n i e decrement of k a k n and μl which would equate to a larger influence of the inhibitory compound and therefore lead to a decrement in the degradation rates according to the point elasticity values of 0 4 0 7 and 0 6 for ka kn k a k n and μl a 10 change in competitive adsorption ka kn ros scavenging k a k n and inner filter effect μl would result in a 4 7 and 6 reduction in the modeled degradation rates respectively 3 5 photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in secondary treated wastewater and river water further insight into the mechanism of nom inhibition was gained from studies using sww and rw the carbamazepine photodegradation removal obtained in these waters is summarized in fig 8 the degree of inhibition of carbamazepine photocatalysis by the different water matrices followed the order sww srnom 3 mg c l 1 rw srnom 1 mg c l 1 and contrary to the previous findings where suva254 and fi showed a strong linear relationship with carbamazepine removal fig 6b and c the lowest removal rate was obtained with the secondary wastewater i e the lowest suva254 and fi value with the carbamazepine removal being around 40 however small reductions in photocatalytic degradation removal less than 15 after 30 min were observed with srnom 1 mg c l 1 and 3 mg c l 1 and rw water matrices in comparison to pure water the highest catalyst deactivation in sww was possibly attributed to the combined effect of the presence of both the different mineral species and organic matter at relatively high concentration in comparison with other water matrices table s3 the predominant inorganic species in the sww were no3 po4 3 and cl with the concentrations varying from 22 mg l 1 to 76 mg l 1 the presence of high concentrations of inorganic species has been linked to the competition for active sites and free radicals i e ros scavenging in addition to these inorganic species so4 2 was also detected in rw and sww data not shown even at low concentrations 0 01 m so4 2 po4 2 and cl decreased the photocatalytic degradation rate for targeted contaminants by reacting with h and oh producing so4 radicals po4 radicals and cl radicals respectively abdullah 1990 so4 radicals po4 radicals and cl radicals are known to be less reactive than oh radicals moreover so4 2 can cause stronger deactivation effect than chlorides because so4 2 scavenges reactive oxygen species at higher rate rioja et al 2016 in the case of no3 at high concentration no3 could be absorbed on the catalyst surface and compete for the active sites with the target pollutants lado ribeiro et al 2019 these phenomenon have been observed for the photocatalytic degradation of clofibric acid in recycled wastewater using uva tio2 rioja et al 2016 the fi values for all water samples before photocatalysis indicated that all water samples shared the characteristics of both terrestrial and microbial aquatic nom 1 2 fi 1 8 the preferential photocatalytic degradation of terrestrially derived organic matter during the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in the presence of organic matter in sww and rw was confirmed fig s12 however the increase of the fi values for sww after the treatment was not higher relative to those in rw and srnom one possible reason for this is the higher abundance of microbial derived organic matter i e small molecular weight and low aromaticity compared with terrestrial derived organic matter i e large molecular weight and high aromaticity in the sww water sample carstea et al 2016 which is less preferentially degraded by photocatalysis keen et al 2014 further the eem peaks indicated that photocatalytic degradation removal of nom peaks followed the order peak c m a t b for both srnom and rw fig s13 which is in agreement with the previous findings in the presence of nom surrogates e g srnom srfa and srha however in the case of the sww the removal of nom peaks followed the order peak t b m a c this indicates that protein like and marine like components were likely to inhibit the cnt tio2 photocatalysis in the sww to a greater extent compared to humic like components although peak t i e microbial derived nom has a low adsorption affinity due to the higher relative abundance of microbial derived nom in sww and the non selective nature of the ros the ros scavenging by peak t i e higher removal of peak t may have occurred this finding is in agreement with the calculation of the relative importance of each inhibition mechanism of nom i e section 3 4 where ros scavenging was still the most important inhibition mechanism in the cnt tio2 photocatalysis another possible reason was that uv photocatalysis preferentially degraded the aromatic compounds and phenols in the sww because the energy of uv photocatalysis is limited the unsaturated bonds would have been transformed into carboxylic acids aldehydes and more meng et al 2016 thus uv photocatalysis would have increased and or maintained the abundance of fulvic acid like and humic acid like compounds in the sww sample the photochemical process of contaminant degradation is energy intensive and the electrical energy per order eeo represents a major fraction of the total operating cost vishnuganth et al 2016 this approach allows for simple comparison and provides data required for scale up and economic analysis the eeo values kwh m 3 order 1 calculated for carbamazepine removal in ultrapure spiked with nom rw and sww are shown in fig s14 in general the electrical energy consumption for the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in water containing nom using cnt tio2 ranged from 43 to 231 kwh m 3 order 1 and where the median eeo values for uv tio2 photocatalysis was reported as being 100 kwh m3 order miklos et al 2018 therefore the synergetic effect of cnt tio2 leads to efficient uv photocatalysis i e srnom and rw cases and supports the applicability of photocatalysis in water treatment process 4 conclusions the main target of this study was to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms during photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine using tio2 and cnt tio2 under uvc and solar light irradiations the results indicated that terrestrially derived nom with high aromaticity and large molecular weight is the major fraction of organic matter that participates in the inhibition process however in the case of sww microbial derived nom which is rich in protein like compounds is the major fraction that participates in the inhibition further analysis using nom inhibition model indicated that the relative importance of the nom inhibition mechanism in cnt tio2 photocatalysis process followed the order ros scavenging inner filter effect competitive adsorption in addition the presence of other water reaction chemistries particularly those involving inorganic species affected the photocatalysis performance by acting as radical scavengers overall cnt tio2 may exhibit a photodegradation activity and participate in an energy efficient process for the removal of carbamazepine depending on the nature of the dissolved organic matter property of the system by providing a comprehensive understanding of the effect of nom in tio2 and cnt tio2 photocatalysis this study will promote the introduction of new treatment strategies

18068,natural organic matter nom can inhibit the photocatalytic degradation of organic micropollutants omps through inner filter effect reactive oxygen species ros scavenging and competitive adsorption however previous studies have focused solely on the bulk properties of nom and our understanding of the inhibition mechanism by nom fractions during photocatalytic degradation of omp is still fragmentary in this study five well characterized different nom samples i e secondary treated wastewater river water and three standard nom surrogates were used to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms during photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine a model omp using tio2 and its composites with carbon nanotubes cnt tio2 under uvc and solar light irradiation the results indicated that terrestrially derived nom with high aromaticity a low oxygen carbon atom ratio and large molecular weight is the major fraction that participates in ros scavenging competitive adsorption and inner filter effect furthermore the modeling analysis suggested that inner filter effect due to nom and ros scavenging was the most influential inhibitory mechanism in the case of secondary treated wastewater the presence of high concentrations of inorganic species e g po4 3 cl and no3 together with nom significantly reduced the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine overall the methods and the results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of nom fractions on photocatalysis and highlight the need to further consider the interplay between nom and background

2016 zouzelka et al 2016 moreover among various carbonaceous materials cnt showed to be the most promising supporting material due to high mechanical strength high thermal stability and potential use of inherently magnetic property for recovery from the solution apul et al 2013 apul and karanfil 2015 ateia et al 2017b ersan et al 2017 also natural organic matter nom such as humic substances is ubiquitous in natural and engineered waters and influences the performance of photocatalysts for the removal of omps for instance low nom concentrations i e 0 5 mg c l 1 in water showed enhancement of the photodegradation rate of carbamazepine by creating attraction sites on the tio2 particles however adverse effects at higher nom concentrations i e 0 5 mg c l 1 were observed brame et al 2015 drosos et al 2015 li and hu 2018 ren et al 2018 ye et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 these studies indicated the importance of inhibition mechanisms by nom for the removal of omps in water and or wastewater from treatment plants where the typical organic concentrations in the water supply and wastewater are more than 0 5 mg c l 1 ahmadi et al 2016 raeke et al 2017 previous studies have reported that nom interferes with photocatalytic degradation via inner filter effect radical scavenging and competition between nom and target omps over the active sorption sites first the presence of nom in water acts as an inner filter which would decrease the availability of light i e energy to produce reactive oxygen species ros ye et al 2019 second in the context of photodegradation the nom can reduce the interaction of targeted contaminants close to the catalysts active site i e competitive adsorption ren et al 2018 third the nom can react with the ros due to the non selective nature of the ros and reduce the effectiveness of the ros in the photodegradation process michael kordatou et al 2015 among those inhibition mechanisms brame et al 2015 stated that ros scavenging and competitive adsorption by nom were the most influential inhibitory mechanisms in a tio2 slurry system yet our understanding of the effect of nom fractions and their compositions on the photocatalytic degradation of omp is still fragmentary the limited observations in previous studies table s1 are due to a number of critical factors 1 most of the studies used high omp concentrations up to 10 mg l which are atypical of environmental concentrations 2 these studies are not necessarily comparable because only a few nom types were tested and there were differences in experimental conditions 3 most of the previous studies focused on the bulk properties of the background nom i e dissolved organic carbon doc during the omp photocatalysis 4 the light source varied among studies i e uvc and solar irradiation 5 almost all of the studies focused on tio2 as a photocatalyst and no studies examined the effect of nom on the photocatalysis of omp by carbonaceous composites of tio2 and 6 the studies used only nom surrogates despite the greater accuracy assessing the inhibition mechanism of nom in real water samples therefore there is still a need for improved understanding of the photocatalysis of omp by tio2 and its carbonaceous composites in the presence of nom to adequately assess the potential engineering applications herein we considered such limitations in the literature and designed this study to elucidate the effects of nom on the photocatalytic degradation of omp using tio2 and cnt tio2 cnt tio2 was chosen as one modified form of carbonaceous tio2 catalysts that attracted a lot of attention for environmental application while tio2 was used as a benchmark photocatalyst to this end the overall objective was to systematically investigate the photocatalytic behavior of carbamazepine as a selected omp in the presence of three nom surrogates i e reverse osmosis isolate nom humic acid and fulvic acid by performing kinetic experiments and using a set of nom characterization techniques i e doc fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy to document the characteristics and fate of background nom during the photocatalysis process i e under uvc and solar irradiation furthermore secondary treated wastewater and river water were used to accurately assessed the inhibition mechanism of nom in real water samples the specific objectives of research were 1 to reveal the relationship between the nom properties and the photocatalytic degradation rate of carbamazepine 2 to reveal the role of nom in the inhibition mechanisms and 3 to determine the relative importance of the inhibition mechanisms i e ros scavenging inner filter effect and competitive adsorption in cnt tio2 systems based on inhibition model analysis and comparison to tio2 system we focused on the degradation of carbamazepine an

received a stock solution of 10 mg l 1 carbamazepine was prepared in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 1 the nom samples were dissolved in 0 01 m naoh solution to prepare a 10 g l 1 nom stock solution and then the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 using 0 1 1 m hcl solutions the volumes of acid and alkali solutions were recorded and considered when calculating the final nom concentration all stock solutions were stored at 4 c in the dark when not in use and the desired concentrations were obtained by diluting the stock solutions with ultrapure water a secondary treated wastewater sww sample was collected in february 2019 after secondary treatment activated sludge and secondary clarifier at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in tokyo japan water from the tama river rw was collected at latitude 35

were poured into pre rinsed amber glass bottles 3 l and stored in a refrigerator 4 c the water quality characteristics of the rw and sww are summarized in table s3 the ph of the water samples was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 under temperature controlled laboratory conditions prior to performing the photocatalysis experiments 2 2 photocatalytic degradation experiments in this study tio2 and cnt tio2 composites were used as the catalysts the detailed preparation and characterization of all catalysts are described in section s1 in the supporting information photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted in 100 ml aqueous solution in a 200 ml glass beaker a magnetic stirrer was used to ensure homogeneous mixing of the catalysts in the solutions solutions were prepared having initial concentrations of 500 μg l 1 for carbamazepine and 3 mg c l 1 for dissolved organic carbon as either srnom srfa or srha the concentrations of carbamazepine and the doc values of the nom were determined based on reported average concentrations in the surface water and in the secondary treated domestic wastewater carbonaro et al 2013 cardoso et al 2014 raeke et al 2017 the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to 7 0 0 2 with 0 01 m hcl and naoh the concentration of tio2 and cnt tio2 was 0 1 g l 1 the water temperature was kept constant at room temperature 26 3 c an 8w uvc lamp glk8mq sankyo denki japan was installed to provide ultraviolet radiation with λ 254 nm and light intensity 80 w m 2 in the case of solar irradiation a solar simulator ms 35aaa ushio lighting edge technologies japan with light intensity of 1000 w m 2 was used as a light source lee et al 2017b for all experiments prior to irradiation the suspension was stirred in the dark for 60 min to allow an adsorption equilibrium of carbamazepine to be established on the catalyst surface it was confirmed that additional stirring for 120 min resulted in no further adsorption of carbamazepine during irradiation an aliquot 50 ml of slurry was withdrawn after 5 10 15 20 and 30 min respectively blank experiments in ultrapure water and also without catalysts were conducted to test the photocatalysis in the absence of nom and photolysis all the experiments were performed in duplicate moreover to elucidate the main oxidizing agents produced by the cnt tio2 system isopropanol oh quencher and sodium oxalate h quencher were employed in the photocatalysis process i e in ultrapure water zhang et al 2018a the effect of water matrices was evaluated by spiking carbamazepine into sww and rw 500 μg l 1 followed by photocatalytic degradation using cnt tio2 under uvc irradiation one 8w uvc lamp λmax 254 nm light intensity 80 w m 2 glk8mq sankyo denki uvc was used as the source of the light irradiation due to the higher energy i e higher photocatalytic activity as a control experiment 500 μg l 1 of carbamazepine was also spiked into the srnom and compared alongside the sww and rw the srnom was selected because its nom property is similar to that of the sww and the rw in terms of fluorescence index fi values and a uvc lamp was used as an irradiation source considering the high energy of this source which would favor the production of radicals the experiments were performed under the same operating conditions examined for ultrapure water spiked with nom standards i e srnom srfa and srha the detailed analytical procedures i e hplc lc ms ms ic toc uv and fluorescence are described in section s2 the photocatalytic activity of the tio2 and cnt tio2 are described using a pseudo first

order rate constant min 1 and t is the time min 2 3 model application the nom inhibition model brame et al 2015 eqs 2 7 for photocatalytic degradation was applied to elucidate the nom inhibition mechanism i e ros scavenging competitive adsorption and inner filter effect in the experiment the results from photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine under solar irradiation in the presence of the srnom were chosen due to the availability of relevant parameters in the literature and the similar nom characteristics to sww and rw 2 dc a dt non k a c a c ros s 1 1 k a c a d k a 1 k a c a 3 c

were taken from the literature sources for identical cnts and modified accordingly with the specific surface area for the cnt tio2 used in this work the degradation rate for carbamazepine removal in the absence and presence of nom dca dt non and dca dt inhibit respectively ca and cn were measured from the experiments some data were used for validation the production of ros in the absence of nom

mechanism for nom inhibition brame et al 2015 the point of elasticity is defined as the percent change in the dependent variable i e carbamazepine degradation rate divided by the percent change in an independent variable the ka kn ka kn and μl parameters are the major independent variables in the inhibition model which can describe the competitive adsorption ros scavenging and inner filter effect respectively brame et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the morphology of the cnt tio2 revealed that tio2 clusters were attached on the surface of the cnt sem image fig s1 which was further confirmed by tem edx analysis figs s2 and s3 the surface area the total pore volume and the pore distribution of the samples are listed in table 1 the specific surface area of the cnt tio2 was three times higher than that of the tio2 furthermore the cnt tio2 showed a narrower bandgap in visible light region 2 8 ev 440 nm than that of the tio2 3 3 ev 376 nm fig s4 which suggested that cnt tio2 may function as a superior photocatalytic material and may be active under both solar and uv irradiation the crystalline property of tio2 and the prepared cnt tio2 was confirmed by xrd analysis fig s5 the diffraction peak of tio2 consisted of anatase main diffraction peak at 2θ 25 3 and rutile main diffraction peak at 2θ 27 4 tio2 peaks the cnt tio2 had four main diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 and 43 which were attributed to the cnt graphite like structure and at 2θ 25 3 and 27 4 which were attributed to anatase and rutile tio2 peaks respectively more details on the characterization of the cnt tio2 are available in a previous report awfa et al 2019 3 2 photolysis and photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine photolysis of carbamazepine by uvc and solar irradiation was well fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model fig s6 direct photolysis of carbamazepine under uvc and solar irradiation showed very low removal 5 with photolysis rate constants k carbamazepine of 5 1 10 4 min 1 and 4 0 7 10 4 min 1 during uvc and solar irradiation respectively the amide bonds in carbamazepine make it highly resistant to uvc deng et al 2013 in the case of direct photolysis under solar irradiation carbamazepine does not have functional groups that absorb radiation 290 nm i e corresponding to the main solar irradiation spectrum wang et al 2017 during photocatalysis carbamazepine was rapidly degraded with k carbamazepine values of 4 75 0 07 10 2 min 1 uvc tio2 7 0 0 08 10 2 min 1 uvc cnt tio2 3 95 0 07 10 2 min 1 solar tio2 and 5 5 0 06 10 2 min 1 solar cnt tio2 as shown in fig 1 given that direct photolysis was negligible it is evident that the removal of carbamazepine was due mainly to its reaction with radicals produced by photocatalysis the participation of radicals in carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation was then clarified by the addition of isopropanol ip as a scavenger for oh and sodium oxalate so as a scavenger of h as shown in fig 1 the addition of ip and so resulted in the inhibition of carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation suggesting that both oh and h participated in the photocatalysis of carbamazepine by tio2 and cnt tio2 in general the photocatalytic activity i e k of cnt tio2 was higher than tio2 because 1 the excited cnt can inject electrons into tio2 which increases the photocurrent woan et al 2009 2 the excitation electron from cnt can combine with dissolved o2 to form superoxide woan et al 2009 and 3 cnt provides suitable sites for the sorption of contaminants which act as an electron sink and facilitates visible light absorption due to the ti o c linkage i e bandgap reduction awfa et al 2019 furthermore uvc photocatalysis showed higher k carbamazepine values than solar irradiation because the shorter wavelength i e uvc is associated with a greater photon energy that can promote electrons to the conduction band with high kinetic energy phong and hur 2016 3 3 photolysis and photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in the presence of different nom surrogates the nom inhibition mechanisms the addition of three different nom surrogates inhibited the carbamazepine photolysis under uvc and solar irradiation fig 2 these inhibitions of carbamazepine photolysis were due presumably to inner filter effect of the srnom the srfa and the srha lee et al 2014 both the srfa and the srha with higher aromatic content i e high suva254 value exhibited more inhibition than the srnom for the photolysis of carbamazepine apparently the nom with high aromatic content can intercept the light transmission and also increase the energy consumption from uvc and solar irradiation guerard et al 2009 furthermore the inhibitory effect of nom on photocatalysis may also be due to the surface deactivation of tio2 and cnt tio2 by adsorption and or radical scavenging brame et al 2015 the adsorbed nom was capable of reducing the interaction of carbamazepine close to the catalyst active sites for the photodegradation process i e competitive adsorption and nom can also scavenge the holes h in the catalyst valence band ren et al 2018 as indicated in fig s7 the competitive adsorption of nom reduced the adsorption capacity of carbamazepine onto cnt tio2 in the order srha srfa srnom the difference in this competitive adsorption can be attributed to the higher aromaticity of the srha as indicated by the suva254 value ateia et al 2017a the presence of the cnt provided a high surface area with hydrophobic sites in the cnt tio2 composite however in the case of tio2 alone the presence of nom had a minimal effect on the adsorption of carbamazepine on tio2 implying that there was no competitive adsorption between carbamazepine and nom this is apparently due to the surface hydrophilicity and limited surface area of tio2 yang and xing 2009 yuan et al 2018 thus the inhibitory effect of nom was attributed mainly to inner filter effect and the radical scavenging for tio2 however in the case of cnt tio2 competitive adsorption together with inner filter effect and radical scavenging were responsible for the mechanism of nom inhibition in photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine the role of nom composition the addition of the nom surrogates negatively affected the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine by tio2 and cnt tio2 under uvc and solar irradiation fig 3 and fig s8 which is consistent with previous studies doll and frimmel 2005 haroune et al 2014 the degree of inhibition of carbamazepine photocatalysis by different nom surrogates followed the order srha srfa srnom implying the dependence of the carbamazepine photocatalysis degradation rate on the nom characteristics nom interferes with the photocatalytic mechanisms via inner filter effect radical scavenging and adsorbed nom competes for active sites with the targeted omp despite the lower photodegradation rate in the presence of nom the reduction in the photodegradation rate of cnt tio2 i e 50 80 inhibition was less than that of tio2 i e 55 90 for both uvc and solar irradiation perhaps due to the fact that the high surface area of the composite provided sufficient active sites for the photocatalytic degradation on cnt tio2 in contrast to that for tio2 awfa et al 2019 the changes in doc during photocatalytic degradation are described in section s3 in the supporting information in addition five excitation emission matrix eem peaks having different excitation emission pairs were investigated to understand the effects of several nom fractions with different sources and relative size variations on the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine table 2 adsorption of nom peaks onto tio2 and cnt tio2 were in the order peak c m a t b fig s9 this order can be explained by the linkage of the terrestrial humic like component with larger and more hydrophobic nom fractions which typically have a higher adsorption affinity on the catalysts zhao et al 2018 irrespective of the nom fractions the adsorption onto cnt tio2 was higher than onto tio2 because cnt tio2 is hydrophobic and has a higher specific surface area in the case of photolysis fig s10 the highest photolysis degradation of the nom fraction was peak t with an excitation wavelength at 275 nm under uvc irradiation uvc irradiation λmax 254 nm in contrast the nom fraction degradation under solar irradiation solar irradiation λmax 550 nm was in the order c m a t b these results were consistent with previous photolysis studies using uvc irradiation phong and hur 2016 and solar irradiation moran et al 2000 the highest removal of nom fractions was found when the excitation peak wavelengths were close to the maximum irradiation wavelength followed by those with longer to shorter peak excitation wavelengths del vecchio and blough 2002 for photocatalytic degradation the order of the nom photocatalytic degradation rate k nom was peak c m a t b for both tio2 and cnt tio2 under uvc and solar irradiation fig 4 a previous study indicated that the different degradation behaviors of the nom peaks can be explained by the catalyst associated reaction pathways phong and hur 2015 the nom peak that was adsorbed or adhered to the catalyst s surface was likely to be more preferably degraded by hydroxyl radicals and or react with holes h leading to the highest degradation therefore it was presumed that peak c gives the highest k carbamazepine inhibition in carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation previous studies reported that the fluorescence index fi can be a superior indicator for investigation of the changes of nom during several water treatment processes such as photocatalysis bekbolet and sen kavurmaci 2015 photocatalytic disinfection birben et al 2017 ozonation rodríguez et al 2014 and adsorption ateia et al 2017a in this study the fi values were calculated to evaluate the preferential removal of nom fractions during carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation as shown in table s2 the fi values for the samples i e before photocatalysis indicated that the srha and the srfa were more likely to be terrestrial derived nom fi 1 2 however the srnom shared the characteristics of both terrestrial and microbial aquatic nom 1 2 fi 1 8 as illustrated in fig 5 the fi values of all nom samples increased after photocatalysis under uvc and solar irradiation fi 1 2 this indicated the preferential photocatalytic degradation of terrestrially derived compounds previous studies tested the same standard nom samples reporting that terrestrially derived nom is rich in aromatic moieties ateia et al 2017a and has a high average molecular weight shimabuku et al 2017 fi is related to the source of nom thus the increase of the fi values further suggests that terrestrially derived nom i e nom fractions with high molecular weight and high aromatic moieties were preferentially removed during the photocatalytic degradation further analysis of the results indicated that k carbamazepine had correlations with the o c ratio suva254 and fi and the degradation rate of peak c fig 6 also nom with lower o c ratios tended to have a higher inhibition in carbamazepine photocatalytic degradation fig 6a lower o c ratios implied the nom contained fewer oxygenic groups especially carbonyl and or carboxylic groups a similar trend was previously observed for the preferential degradation of nom with low o c ratio by tio2 lv et al 2017 in addition terrestrially derived nom low fi value with high aromaticity high suva254 value exhibited higher inhibition of k carbamazepine fig 6b and c which is in agreement with fig 6d where higher degradation rates for peak c terrestrial humic like and high molecular weight components of nom led to a decrease in k carbamazepine 3 4 the relative importance of each inhibition mechanism in the photocatalytic degradation the previous study indicated that the inhibition model gave a reasonable prediction r2 0 88 for the photocatalytic degradation of the omp in the presence of background nom with tio2 under uva irradiation and the relative importance of nom inhibition followed the order ros scavenging competitive adsorption inner filter effect brame et al 2015 therefore the existing inhibition model could also be useful for explaining the role of each nom inhibition mechanism in the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine using cnt tio2 in this study the model predicted the degradation rates of carbamazepine using cnt tio2 with a high degree of accuracy r2 0 8 rmse 0 0005 mg l 1 min 1 fig s11 this result validated the existing nom inhibition model and showed its capability to predict degradation of omps in water containing nom using cnt tio2 under solar light irradiation as shown in fig 7 the relative importance of the nom inhibition mechanism in cnt tio2 photocatalysis followed the order ros scavenging inner filter effect competitive adsorption this finding was contrary to the previous study conducted by brame et al 2015 where competitive adsorption was found to be relatively more important than inner filter effect in the case of tio2 this inhibitory effect depends significantly on the physicochemical properties of the target compound the catalyst and the quality and quantity of nom despite the fact that a similar nom i e srnom was used it should be noted that the previous study involved tio2 while in this study cnt tio2 was used as the photocatalyst the high surface area of the cnt tio2 unlike tio2 provided sufficient active sites for the adsorption therefore the difference in the catalyst properties affected the relative order of inner filter effect and competitive adsorption yet the role played by nom as a ros scavenging still provided the most important inhibition mechanism in the photocatalytic degradation of omp for both tio2 and cnt tio2 furthermore a change of nom property would also affect the cnt tio2 photocatalysis in the case of nom with higher aromaticity and molecular weight there would be an increase in the values of kn i e decrement of ka kn k n i e decrement of k a k n and μl which would equate to a larger influence of the inhibitory compound and therefore lead to a decrement in the degradation rates according to the point elasticity values of 0 4 0 7 and 0 6 for ka kn k a k n and μl a 10 change in competitive adsorption ka kn ros scavenging k a k n and inner filter effect μl would result in a 4 7 and 6 reduction in the modeled degradation rates respectively 3 5 photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in secondary treated wastewater and river water further insight into the mechanism of nom inhibition was gained from studies using sww and rw the carbamazepine photodegradation removal obtained in these waters is summarized in fig 8 the degree of inhibition of carbamazepine photocatalysis by the different water matrices followed the order sww srnom 3 mg c l 1 rw srnom 1 mg c l 1 and contrary to the previous findings where suva254 and fi showed a strong linear relationship with carbamazepine removal fig 6b and c the lowest removal rate was obtained with the secondary wastewater i e the lowest suva254 and fi value with the carbamazepine removal being around 40 however small reductions in photocatalytic degradation removal less than 15 after 30 min were observed with srnom 1 mg c l 1 and 3 mg c l 1 and rw water matrices in comparison to pure water the highest catalyst deactivation in sww was possibly attributed to the combined effect of the presence of both the different mineral species and organic matter at relatively high concentration in comparison with other water matrices table s3 the predominant inorganic species in the sww were no3 po4 3 and cl with the concentrations varying from 22 mg l 1 to 76 mg l 1 the presence of high concentrations of inorganic species has been linked to the competition for active sites and free radicals i e ros scavenging in addition to these inorganic species so4 2 was also detected in rw and sww data not shown even at low concentrations 0 01 m so4 2 po4 2 and cl decreased the photocatalytic degradation rate for targeted contaminants by reacting with h and oh producing so4 radicals po4 radicals and cl radicals respectively abdullah 1990 so4 radicals po4 radicals and cl radicals are known to be less reactive than oh radicals moreover so4 2 can cause stronger deactivation effect than chlorides because so4 2 scavenges reactive oxygen species at higher rate rioja et al 2016 in the case of no3 at high concentration no3 could be absorbed on the catalyst surface and compete for the active sites with the target pollutants lado ribeiro et al 2019 these phenomenon have been observed for the photocatalytic degradation of clofibric acid in recycled wastewater using uva tio2 rioja et al 2016 the fi values for all water samples before photocatalysis indicated that all water samples shared the characteristics of both terrestrial and microbial aquatic nom 1 2 fi 1 8 the preferential photocatalytic degradation of terrestrially derived organic matter during the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in the presence of organic matter in sww and rw was confirmed fig s12 however the increase of the fi values for sww after the treatment was not higher relative to those in rw and srnom one possible reason for this is the higher abundance of microbial derived organic matter i e small molecular weight and low aromaticity compared with terrestrial derived organic matter i e large molecular weight and high aromaticity in the sww water sample carstea et al 2016 which is less preferentially degraded by photocatalysis keen et al 2014 further the eem peaks indicated that photocatalytic degradation removal of nom peaks followed the order peak c m a t b for both srnom and rw fig s13 which is in agreement with the previous findings in the presence of nom surrogates e g srnom srfa and srha however in the case of the sww the removal of nom peaks followed the order peak t b m a c this indicates that protein like and marine like components were likely to inhibit the cnt tio2 photocatalysis in the sww to a greater extent compared to humic like components although peak t i e microbial derived nom has a low adsorption affinity due to the higher relative abundance of microbial derived nom in sww and the non selective nature of the ros the ros scavenging by peak t i e higher removal of peak t may have occurred this finding is in agreement with the calculation of the relative importance of each inhibition mechanism of nom i e section 3 4 where ros scavenging was still the most important inhibition mechanism in the cnt tio2 photocatalysis another possible reason was that uv photocatalysis preferentially degraded the aromatic compounds and phenols in the sww because the energy of uv photocatalysis is limited the unsaturated bonds would have been transformed into carboxylic acids aldehydes and more meng et al 2016 thus uv photocatalysis would have increased and or maintained the abundance of fulvic acid like and humic acid like compounds in the sww sample the photochemical process of contaminant degradation is energy intensive and the electrical energy per order eeo represents a major fraction of the total operating cost vishnuganth et al 2016 this approach allows for simple comparison and provides data required for scale up and economic analysis the eeo values kwh m 3 order 1 calculated for carbamazepine removal in ultrapure spiked with nom rw and sww are shown in fig s14 in general the electrical energy consumption for the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in water containing nom using cnt tio2 ranged from 43 to 231 kwh m 3 order 1 and where the median eeo values for uv tio2 photocatalysis was reported as being 100 kwh m3 order miklos et al 2018 therefore the synergetic effect of cnt tio2 leads to efficient uv photocatalysis i e srnom and rw cases and supports the applicability of photocatalysis in water treatment process 4 conclusions the main target of this study was to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms during photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine using tio2 and cnt tio2 under uvc and solar light irradiations the results indicated that terrestrially derived nom with high aromaticity and large molecular weight is the major fraction of organic matter that participates in the inhibition process however in the case of sww microbial derived nom which is rich in protein like compounds is the major fraction that participates in the inhibition further analysis using nom inhibition model indicated that the relative importance of the nom inhibition mechanism in cnt tio2 photocatalysis process followed the order ros scavenging inner filter effect competitive adsorption in addition the presence of other water reaction chemistries particularly those involving inorganic species affected the photocatalysis performance by acting as radical scavengers overall cnt tio2 may exhibit a photodegradation activity and participate in an energy efficient process for the removal of carbamazepine depending on the nature of the dissolved organic matter property of the system by providing a comprehensive understanding of the effect of nom in tio2 and cnt tio2 photocatalysis this study will promote the introduction of new treatment strategies

18069,previous studies have reported that biofilm extracted from full scale biofilters can serve as nitrogenous disinfection by product n dbp precursors detached biofilm materials could escape during filter ripening and form n dbp upon chloramination this study examined the potential breakthrough of biofilm and n dbp precursors during filter ripening at two water treatment plants wtps the presence of biofilm material in aqueous samples was estimated by total adenosine triphosphate tatp levels n dbp formation potential fp tests were conducted under uniform formation conditions to quantify n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and haloacetonitrile han4 precursors while tatp peaks in filter effluent were observed post backwash at both wtps temporary increases of effluent ndma fp were only observed during filter ripening where particle associated ndma precursors served as the dominant contributor overall biofilters examined in this study demonstrated a consistent removal of ndma fp regardless of the filter ripening process graphical abstract image 1 keywords filter ripening n nitrosodimethylamine biofilm disinfection by products 1 introduction chloramination is gaining popularity for secondary disinfection as an alternative to chlorination since it forms lower levels of carbonaceous dbps c dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas guay et al 2005 however the formation of nitrogenous dbps n dbps which are more toxicologically potent than c dbps muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 may be enhanced due to the increased use of chloramination one of the widely reported n dbps in drinking water is n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which is currently regulated at 10 ng l in the state of massachusetts commonwealth of massachusetts 2018 and at 9 ng l in ontario canada moecc 2017 and has a notification level of 10 ng l in california california state water resources control 2017 anthropogenic compounds in source waters that are impacted by wastewater effluent including pharmaceuticals and personal care products could serve as ndma precursors shen and andrews 2011 in addition another important class of potent n dbps haloacetonitriles hans can also be formed upon chloramination previous studies have identified free amino acids including aspartic acid and tryptophan as well as proteinaceous materials as important sources of trichloroacetonitrile tcan and dichloroacetonitrile dcan precursors bond et al 2014 jia et al 2016 biofiltration has been shown to be effective for ndma precursor removal via biodegradation and or adsorption farre et al 2011 liao et al 2015 mckie et al 2019a however other studies have provided evidence that biofiltration itself could release ndma precursors krasner et al 2018 possibly originating from biofilm related materials including cells as well as extracellular polymeric substances eps containing proteins and polysaccharides that may be sloughed off of filter media liu et al 2017 in order to investigate the contribution of biofilm related compounds to ndma formation in drinking water biofilters di tommaso et al 2019 extracted organic matter from biofilm on full scale biofilter media and reported that it could contribute up to 0 80 ng ndma g media as well as 18 7 ng dcan g media from chloramination formation potential tests this may pose a problem for the use of biofiltration in drinking water treatment since certain aspects related to filter maintenance including filter backwash and periods of stagnation may cause biofilm sloughing and its availability to form n dbps wang et al 2012 with the exception of di tommaso et al 2019 who reported no release of ndma precursor during filter start up following a period of stagnation the implications of other filter maintenance practices have not been reported in the literature filter backwash is an essential maintenance technique applied to clean and restore biofilter treatment capacity by removing both retained particles and excess biomass granular media based filtration systems are required to optimize backwash procedures to reduce negative impacts of degraded effluent water quality associated with filter ripening amburgey and amirtharajah 2005 suggested that an initial lag phase exists which corresponds to the passage of clean water remaining at the bottom of the filter at the conclusion of a backwash following which there is an increase in effluent turbidity known as the remnant stage increased turbidity is caused by particles that have been detached from the media but have not been completely washed out of the filter box as a result particles remain either in the pore space or above the media in the final stage a gradual decrease in the effluent turbidity reflects an improvement in filtration efficiency as newly attached particles aid the collection of others currently turbidity serves as the only regulated parameter used to evaluate the effectiveness of a backwash even though the release of biofilm related materials reported to be ndma precursors could also occur during filter ripening previous biofiltration studies which have focused mainly on the steady state portion of a filter run reported variable removal or contribution of n dbp precursors by biofiltration depending on source water quality pretreatment processes eg ozonation and operating conditions farre et al 2011 krasner et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 mckie et al 2019a with an increasing number of utilities switching to chloramination for secondary disinfection li 2011 it is critical to examine the impact of filter backwash on n dbp formation potential during filter ripening as such the main objectives of this study were to 1 compare the performance of biofiltration in terms of organics removal under a range of operating conditions i e flow rate filter run time and washwater chemistry with an emphasis on the removal of n dbp precursors 2 distinguish between the contributions of particulate n dbp and dissolved n dbp precursors in both backwash water and the remnant impacted influent and 3 to investigate the potential breakthrough of biofilm and n dbp precursors especially during the initial stages of filter ripening as such this full scale study investigated aqueous adenosine triphosphate atp as a surrogate for microbial biomass as well as ndma and han formation potential in biofilter influent and effluent collected prior to during and post backwash at two water treatment plants the findings of this study have important implications regarding backwash strategies and filter to waste practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale plant configuration water treatment plant wtp a treats lake ontario water with ozonation biofiltration uv ultrafiltration and chlorination wtp b treats lake simcoe water with coagulation ultrafiltration biofiltration and chlorination biofilters at both plants contain a 2 5 m depth of granular activated carbon gac however the two plants operate and backwash their biofilters in very different manners as contrasted in table 1 2 2 sampling methods water samples were collected from full scale biofilters before backwash and during ripening from both the influent and effluent in duplicate using 500 ml chlorine demand free amber glass bottles following backwash influent water was sampled from just above the filter media at 0 10 20 30 60 120 and 180 min post backwash whereas effluent water was collected at 2 4 6 10 20 30 60 90 120 and 180 min after placing the filter back into service in addition influent and effluent samples were collected at 10 and 20 min prior to backwash to assess the removal of nitrogenous dbps at the end of a filter run which may assist in estimating the time to reach steady state samples of backwash waste were collected in the middle of the water wash stage three sampling events were conducted at each facility biofilter influent water temperature at the time of sampling was 2 0 0 3 c for wtp a and 7 8 0 6 c for wtp b table 2 summarizes the accumulated filter run time prior to backwash empty bed contact time ebct and water temperature in each trial 2 3 analytical methods dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured on site using a ysi 550a do meter ysi inc ohio ph was measured in the lab with an orion star a111 ph meter vwr scientific inc mississauga ontario dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with an o i corporation 1010 toc analyzer college station texas usa using a persulfate wet oxidation method total atp tatp in water samples was quantified using the quench gone aqueous method with a luminultra atp test kit as well as 0 22 μm millex sterile filters with pes membranes according to the manufacturer s instructions uv254 and uv280 were measured using a ce 3055 single beam cecil uv visible spectrophotometer cambridge england specific uv absorbance suva was calculated by dividing the uv absorbance by its doc concentration potter and wimsatt 2005 ndma and han precursors were estimated using the uniform formation condition ufc method as per summers et al 1996 monochloramine prepared at a cl2 n mass ratio of 4 2 1 was added to 500 ml of sample at a dose adjusted to satisfy the predetermined chloramine demand and achieve a 24 h residual of 2 5 mg 0 5 mg l ndma extraction and analysis methods were as previously described by shen and andrews 2011 briefly ndma was extracted from 400 ml of sample with 200 mg of lewatit af 5 beads using d6 ndma as the internal standard ndma formation potentials were quantified using a varian 450 gc coupled with a varian 240 ion trap mass spectrometer gc ms with a method detection limit of 2 ng l han4 including bromochloroacetonitrile bcan dibromoacetonitrile dban dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan were extracted from 25 ml of each sample using 4 ml of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe as the organic solvent and 1 2 dibromopropane as the internal standard each sample was sealed using teflon lined silicon septa and a screw cap shaken for 2 5 min and left standing for 60 min to allow phase separation the organic layer was then transferred into a gc vial and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detection gc ecd statistical comparisons between trials were conducted using paired t tests of a significance level of 95 two tailed tests were used unless specified otherwise to identify whether variations in filter run time and ebcts resulted in a significant difference between trials based on reported p values 3 results and discussion 3 1 full scale biofilter performance characteristics of influent and effluent water samples at both wtps are summarized in table 3 temperature ph and do were monitored throughout the sampling period to characterize changes in water quality during filter ripening in addition influent and effluent doc uv254 and uv280 were quantified as surrogates for overall aromatic and protein like organic content respectively weishaar et al 2003 li et al 2016 in general filter backwash had no significant impact on water quality parameters which remained stable during the filter ripening period as monitored for three hours post backwash at both locations it should be noted that influent doc 2 2 mg l at wtp a was approximately half of that observed at wtp b influent do at wtp a was on average 36 higher due to the low ozone dose 1 mg l during pre treatment however biofilters at wtp b consumed more dissolved oxygen 7 and achieved greater organics removal in terms of doc 7 uv254 13 and uv280 11 likely due to higher doc and the availability of biodegradable organic carbon in lake simcoe water source water doc was unable to be efficiently removed by biofilters at wtp a due to its high content of recalcitrant carbon zhao et al 2019 even though ozone was implemented as pre treatment to increase biodegradability yavich et al 2004 as shown in table 3 influent water at both plants had similar suva254 values which has previously been correlated with thm formation upon chlorination edzwald et al 1985 however suva280 values were on average two times higher at wtp b table 3 suggesting that the influent exhibited more protein like character per unit concentration of organic carbon possibly attributing to its greater biodegradability relative to that of wtp a 3 2 impact of backwash on tatp levels total atp tatp measurements were performed for influent effluent and backwash waste samples fig 1 and s1 in general results indicate that full scale biofilter at two locations even though operated and backwashed with different strategies reacted similarly during filter ripening with respect to tatp levels influent tatp levels decreased with time whereas effluent tatp levels spiked temporarily before stabilizing statistical comparisons show that neither filter run time or ebct had a significant impact on effluent tatp during the filter ripening p value 0 05 table 2 and s1 bacterial abundance and community composition of biofilms on the surface of gac media depend on a variety of operational parameters including nutrient availability ebct filter run time and backwash regime gerrity et al 2018 liao et al 2013 emelko et al 2006 filter backwash may be used to remove excess biofilm on the surface of filter media leading to a 15 40 loss of biomass kasuga et al 2007 miltner et al 1995 and prevent head loss buildup this could explain the high tatp levels of 680 66 ng l and 4151 1145 ng l in the backwash waste sampled at wtp a and wtp b respectively fig 1 the loss of biomass attributed to backwash at wtp b was likely associated with the use of chlorinated backwash water as a result influent samples collected immediately post backwash which represent the backwash remnant contained not only particles but also biofilm material and tatp the remnant tatp level in the influent at 0 min post backwash was 157 57 ng l at wtp a for wtp b tatp level spiked to 2284 1384 ng l at 10 min post backwash fig 1 the impact of the backwash remnant declined over time due to the continued mixing of remnant water and fresh influent water in the upper region of the filter box influent tatp levels decreased over time and stabilized to pre backwash levels effluent tatp levels at the two wtps exhibited similar trends following backwash at wtp a effluent tatp increased from a pre backwash level of 8 6 ng l peaking to 59 18 ng l at 6 min post backwash then reaching a steady state level of 5 3 ng l following approximately 60 min of operation similarly at wtp b effluent tatp increased from 14 9 ng l prior to backwash and peaked to 555 134 ng l at 20 min post backwash then decreased to 48 15 ng l following 90 min of operation and remained stable until 180 min fig 1 the temporary increase in total atp in biofilter effluent could be caused by the breakthrough of backwash remnant water that was retained in the filter box above the media as well as in the pore space of the media effluent tatp peaks occurred at 4 6 min wtp a and 10 min wtp b after the remnant tatp peaks in the influent fig s1 which agree well with the approximate hydraulic residence time of the full scale biofilters at both wtp a 5 2 min and wtp b 8 2 min respectively the theoretical hydraulic residence time i e the time it takes for the water to travel through the fixed bed of media was estimated by using a porosity of 0 43 as previously calculated for the calgon f300 gac effective size 0 8 1 mm by mckie et al 2019b total atp levels at the end of a filter cycle i e prior to backwash were measured to examine the detachment of microorganisms during steady state operation results show that effluent tatp levels were significantly higher than those observed in the influent at both facilities paired one tailed t tests with 95 significance level p value 0 01 indicating loss of biofilm from the media release of tatp during biofilter operation was also observed by di tommaso et al 2019 likely resulting from hydrodynamic shear in the filter zhu et al 2010 furthermore tatp levels in the effluent and remnant impacted influent were generally higher at wtp b than those at wtp a possibly owing to the higher atp levels on the biofilter media table 1 3 3 impact of backwash on nitrogenous dbp precursors ufc fp tests were performed on biofilter influent and effluent to assess ripening in terms of ndma precursor concentrations results are presented in fig 2 typically higher ndma fp levels were observed at wtp b which corresponds to the higher protein like organic content as estimated by suva280 and higher doc in contrast to post backwash tatp trends biofilters at the two wtps behaved differently with respect to the elevated ndma fp in the remnant impacted influent during filter ripening this could not be attributed to ebcts or filter run time as neither lead to significant differences in ndma fp p value 0 05 table 2 and s1 at either location prior to backwash ndma fp in wtp a influent was 3 5 0 9 ng l ndma fp increased to 8 1 2 6 ng l as a result of the impact of backwash remnants immediately post backwash i e 0 min then gradually stabilized to 4 2 0 9 ng l at a run time of 180 min fig 2a similar to samples collected prior to backwash influent ndma fp in trial 1 reached stability faster likely due to the lower ebct backwash had no impact on effluent ndma fp which remained stable at 2 5 0 6 ng l during filter ripening at wtp b an elevated ndma fp of 67 3 23 1 ng l was observed at 10 min post backwash in the remnant impacted influent during filter ripening influent ndma fp decreased by 40 60 in the first 60 min of operation as new influent water mixed with backwash remnant water and travelled through the filter influent ndma stabilized to 11 9 3 ng l at 180 min fig 2b comparable to prior to backwash levels 11 2 2 5 ng l significantly lower ndma fp 2 2 1 8 ng l was observed in the effluent immediately post backwash because it represents the unused chlorinated backwash water remaining in the effluent pipes and or underdrain region chlorine has been identified in previous studies as an effective oxidant to reduce ndma precursors selbes et al 2014 shen and andrews 2013 subsequently effluent ndma increased to 14 8 4 2 ng l at 30 min post backwash prior to gradually decreasing to 6 1 0 6 ng l following 180 min of operation one possible explanation for the spikes in effluent post backwash ndma precursor levels at wtp b could be breakthrough of particulate ndma precursors from the remnant impacted influent which is further discussed in section 3 4 higher precursor levels in the feed water during the last filter cycle as demonstrated by influent ndma fp prior to backwash were associated with those in the remnant impacted influent at wtp b fig 2b irrespective the magnitude shape and duration of the ndma fp effluent increase appeared to be independent of precursor concentrations in the feed or remnant impacted influent water ndma fp removal δndma fp by biofiltration at both wtps is shown in fig 3 greater removal of ndma fp was observed within the first 10 min post backwash for both plants suggesting that ndma precursors in the remnant impacted influent were primarily associated with particulates that were collected by the media upon filter restart steady state δndma fp reached 3 1 0 5 ng l at 30 min post backwash for wtp a and 6 6 1 1 ng l at 120 min of operation for wtp b in addition to ndma fp han4 fp was also measured in each influent effluent and the backwash sample collected all results were below detection limits 0 8 μg l at wtp a at wtp b dcan fp in the biofilter effluent decreased from 1 5 0 2 μg l immediately post backwash to below the detection level of 0 8 μg l following 10 min of operation fig 4 however han4 was not observed in any influent or backwash samples suggesting that han precursors in the biofilter may not be associated with particulate matter perez and susa 2017 hypothesized that microorganisms would produce aromatic proteins such as tryptophan in stressed environments i e the presence of chlorine to consume chlorine and reduce cell contact this suggests that the observed dcan fp in the biofilter effluent could potentially result from the reaction between free chlorine in the backwash water and dcan precursors produced by microorganisms in gac media pore spaces the decreasing dcan post backwash corresponds to the hydraulic washout of the pore space water containing dcan that was formed during backwash 3 4 contributions of dissolved and particulate ndma precursors in order to further characterize the impact of backwash remnant water two additional replicate samples were collected from the influent at 0 min 10 min and 20 min post backwash as well as of the backwash waste at both locations trials 2 6 to examine the contribution of particulate ndma precursors including precursors adsorbed to particulates and dissolved ndma precursors to influent ndma fp mitch and sedlak 2004 performed size separation of ndma precursors in municipal wastewater effluent and reported that particle associated ndma precursors are typically 0 7 μm as such the replicates were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter prior to chloramination fp tests in order to separate dissolved from particulate precursors particulate ndma precursors total ndma fp dissolved ndma fp contributed an average 48 of the total ndma fp in the backwash waste at wtp a fig 5 after the biofilter was placed back into service particulate ndma precursors accounted for 9 24 average 18 of the total ndma fp in the influent during the first 20 min of filter operation indicating that the backwash at wtp a was effective in removing particulate ndma precursors in contrast at wtp b the contribution of particulate ndma precursors in the backwash waste represented on average 79 of the total ndma fp particulate precursors remained to be the dominant contributor of ndma fp in the post backwash influent with 78 observed in the remnant impacted influent at 0 min decreasing to 65 at 20 min post backwash the substantial contribution of particulate ndma precursors at wtp b could be attributed to particulate associated organic nitrogen including bacterially sourced organic matter that detached from the biofilm during backwash which exhibited higher ndma yields when compared to dissolved organic nitrogen as reported by hu et al 2016 moreover particle associated ndma precursors could also be contributed by ndma precursors that adsorbed onto colloids or particulate compounds in the backwash remnant water the adsorption of dissolved ndma precursors was potentially enhanced due to the charge neutralization of particulate matter by coagulation takeuchi et al 2018 3 5 correlation between tatp and ndma precursor concentration elevated levels of tatp and ndma fp were observed in the post backwash remnant impacted influent at both wtps and correlations between tatp and dissolved ndma fp as well as particulate ndma fp total ndma fp dissolved ndma fp for samples collected during and immediately following the backwash were calculated an r2 coefficient of determination value of 0 93 was observed between tatp and particulate ndma fp fig 6 a however the filtered influent samples representing dissolved ndma fp showed a low correlation r2 0 51 with tatp fig 6 b as such detached particulates which may contain biofilm related materials or adsorbed organics may be considered the primary contributors of particle associated ndma fp in the backwash remnant further research is required to establish which component s of the detached particulates are responsible for the ndma fp however the strong correlation shown in fig 6a suggests that tatp could serve as a useful indicator regardless of their presence in biofilter influent shortly after backwash detached particulates were well removed when the biofilters were returned to service a similar comparison of tatp and ndma fp profiles of post backwash biofilter effluent indicated that they are not well correlated following biofiltration r2 0 53 data not shown the tatp entering the biofilters increased post backwash at both plants whereas effluent ndma fp either remained stable wtp a or spiked 10 min later than influent tatp wtp b the low ndma fp concentrations in the effluent samples were likely the main factor that made these statistical comparisons challenging 4 conclusions recent studies have reported that biofiltration may contribute to n dbp formation due to the sloughing of biofilm this full scale study examined post backwash biofilter ripening in terms of the potential release of biofilm related materials and n dbp fp in the effluent at two water treatment plants the following conclusions are drawn elevated ndma fp and tatp levels observed in the backwash waste and remnant impacted influent at both plants likely originated from extracellular material and source organic matter during backwash however effluent ndma fp was consistently lower than that in the influent indicating effective removal of ndma precursors regardless of the filter ripening process tatp peaks in filter effluent were observed post backwash at both wtps the occurrence of which agreed with the hydraulic residence time of the corresponding full scale biofilters temporary increases of effluent ndma fp were only observed during filter ripening at wtp b likely due to the breakthrough of particle associated ndma precursors in the backwash remnant which may include bacterially associated particulate matter as well as dissolved precursors that were adsorbed onto particulate matter further research is required to characterize bacterially sourced particulate ndma precursors variations in filter ebct and filter run time did not lead to a significant difference in effluent ndma fp or tatp levels during filter ripening however source water quality pre treatment strategy backwash procedure and the use of chlorinated backwash water could attribute to the formation of n dbps and the release of biofilm related compounds in biofilter effluent post backwash declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

18069,previous studies have reported that biofilm extracted from full scale biofilters can serve as nitrogenous disinfection by product n dbp precursors detached biofilm materials could escape during filter ripening and form n dbp upon chloramination this study examined the potential breakthrough of biofilm and n dbp precursors during filter ripening at two water treatment plants wtps the presence of biofilm material in aqueous samples was estimated by total adenosine triphosphate tatp levels n dbp formation potential fp tests were conducted under uniform formation conditions to quantify n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and haloacetonitrile han4 precursors while tatp peaks in filter effluent were observed post backwash at both wtps temporary increases of effluent ndma fp were only observed during filter ripening where particle associated ndma precursors served as the dominant contributor overall biofilters examined in this study demonstrated a consistent removal of ndma fp regardless of the filter ripening process graphical abstract image 1 keywords filter ripening n nitrosodimethylamine biofilm disinfection by products 1 introduction chloramination is gaining popularity for secondary disinfection as an alternative to chlorination since it forms lower levels of carbonaceous dbps c dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas guay et al 2005 however the formation of nitrogenous dbps n dbps which are more toxicologically potent than c dbps muellner et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 may be enhanced due to the increased use of chloramination one of the widely reported n dbps in drinking water is n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which is currently regulated at 10 ng l in the state of massachusetts commonwealth of massachusetts 2018 and at 9 ng l in ontario canada moecc 2017 and has a notification level of 10 ng l in california california state water resources control 2017 anthropogenic compounds in source waters that are impacted by wastewater effluent including pharmaceuticals and personal care products could serve as ndma precursors shen and andrews 2011 in addition another important class of potent n dbps haloacetonitriles hans can also be formed upon chloramination previous studies have identified free amino acids including aspartic acid and tryptophan as well as proteinaceous materials as important sources of trichloroacetonitrile tcan and dichloroacetonitrile dcan precursors bond et al 2014 jia et al 2016 biofiltration has been shown to be effective for ndma precursor removal via biodegradation and or adsorption farre et al 2011 liao et al 2015 mckie et al 2019a however other studies have provided evidence that biofiltration itself could release ndma precursors krasner et al 2018 possibly originating from biofilm related materials including cells as well as extracellular polymeric substances eps containing proteins and polysaccharides that may be sloughed off of filter media liu et al 2017 in order to investigate the contribution of biofilm related compounds to ndma formation in drinking water biofilters di tommaso et al 2019 extracted organic matter from biofilm on full scale biofilter media and reported that it could contribute up to 0 80 ng ndma g media as well as 18 7 ng dcan g media from chloramination formation potential tests this may pose a problem for the use of biofiltration in drinking water treatment since certain aspects related to filter maintenance including filter backwash and periods of stagnation may cause biofilm sloughing and its availability to form n dbps wang et al 2012 with the exception of di tommaso et al 2019 who reported no release of ndma precursor during filter start up following a period of stagnation the implications of other filter maintenance practices have not been reported in the literature filter backwash is an essential maintenance technique applied to clean and restore biofilter treatment capacity by removing both retained particles and excess biomass granular media based filtration systems are required to optimize backwash procedures to reduce negative impacts of degraded effluent water quality associated with filter ripening amburgey and amirtharajah 2005 suggested that an initial lag phase exists which corresponds to the passage of clean water remaining at the bottom of the filter at the conclusion of a backwash following which there is an increase in effluent turbidity known as the remnant stage increased turbidity is caused by particles that have been detached from the media but have not been completely washed out of the filter box as a result particles remain either in the pore space or above the media in the final stage a gradual decrease in the effluent turbidity reflects an improvement in filtration efficiency as newly attached particles aid the collection of others currently turbidity serves as the only regulated parameter used to evaluate the effectiveness of a backwash even though the release of biofilm related materials reported to be ndma precursors could also occur during filter ripening previous biofiltration studies which have focused mainly on the steady state portion of a filter run reported variable removal or contribution of n dbp precursors by biofiltration depending on source water quality pretreatment processes eg ozonation and operating conditions farre et al 2011 krasner et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 mckie et al 2019a with an increasing number of utilities switching to chloramination for secondary disinfection li 2011 it is critical to examine the impact of filter backwash on n dbp formation potential during filter ripening as such the main objectives of this study were to 1 compare the performance of biofiltration in terms of organics removal under a range of operating conditions i e flow rate filter run time and washwater chemistry with an emphasis on the removal of n dbp precursors 2 distinguish between the contributions of particulate n dbp and dissolved n dbp precursors in both backwash water and the remnant impacted influent and 3 to investigate the potential breakthrough of biofilm and n dbp precursors especially during the initial stages of filter ripening as such this full scale study investigated aqueous adenosine triphosphate atp as a surrogate for microbial biomass as well as ndma and han formation potential in biofilter influent and effluent collected prior to during and post backwash at two water treatment plants the findings of this study have important implications regarding backwash strategies and filter to waste practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale plant configuration water treatment plant wtp a treats lake ontario water with ozonation biofiltration uv ultrafiltration and chlorination wtp b treats lake simcoe water with coagulation ultrafiltration biofiltration and chlorination biofilters at both plants contain a 2 5 m depth of granular activated carbon gac however the two plants operate and backwash their biofilters in very different manners as contrasted in table 1 2 2 sampling methods water samples were collected from full scale biofilters before backwash and during ripening from both the influent and effluent in duplicate using 500 ml chlorine demand free amber glass bottles following backwash influent water was sampled from just above the filter media at 0 10 20 30 60 120 and 180 min post backwash whereas effluent water was collected at 2 4 6 10 20 30 60 90 120 and 180 min after placing the filter back into service in addition influent and effluent samples were collected at 10 and 20 min prior to backwash to assess the removal of nitrogenous dbps at the end of a filter run which may assist in estimating the time to reach steady state samples of backwash waste were collected in the middle of the water wash stage three sampling events were conducted at each facility biofilter influent water temperature at the time of sampling was 2 0 0 3 c for wtp a and 7 8 0 6 c for wtp b table 2 summarizes the accumulated filter run time prior to backwash empty bed contact time ebct and water temperature in each trial 2 3 analytical methods dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured on site using a ysi 550a do meter ysi inc ohio ph was measured in the lab with an orion star a111 ph meter vwr scientific inc mississauga ontario dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with an o i corporation 1010 toc analyzer college station texas usa using a persulfate wet oxidation method total atp tatp in water samples was quantified using the quench gone aqueous method with a luminultra atp test kit as well as 0 22 μm millex sterile filters with pes membranes according to the manufacturer s instructions uv254 and uv280 were measured using a ce 3055 single beam cecil uv visible spectrophotometer cambridge england specific uv absorbance suva was calculated by dividing the uv absorbance by its doc concentration potter and wimsatt 2005 ndma and han precursors were estimated using the uniform formation condition ufc method as per summers et al 1996 monochloramine prepared at a cl2 n mass ratio of 4 2 1 was added to 500 ml of sample at a dose adjusted to satisfy the predetermined chloramine demand and achieve a 24 h residual of 2 5 mg 0 5 mg l ndma extraction and analysis methods were as previously described by shen and andrews 2011 briefly ndma was extracted from 400 ml of sample with 200 mg of lewatit af 5 beads using d6 ndma as the internal standard ndma formation potentials were quantified using a varian 450 gc coupled with a varian 240 ion trap mass spectrometer gc ms with a method detection limit of 2 ng l han4 including bromochloroacetonitrile bcan dibromoacetonitrile dban dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan were extracted from 25 ml of each sample using 4 ml of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe as the organic solvent and 1 2 dibromopropane as the internal standard each sample was sealed using teflon lined silicon septa and a screw cap shaken for 2 5 min and left standing for 60 min to allow phase separation the organic layer was then transferred into a gc vial and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detection gc ecd statistical comparisons between trials were conducted using paired t tests of a significance level of 95 two tailed tests were used unless specified otherwise to identify whether variations in filter run time and ebcts resulted in a significant difference between trials based on reported p values 3 results and discussion 3 1 full scale biofilter performance characteristics of influent and effluent water samples at both wtps are summarized in table 3 temperature ph and do were monitored throughout the sampling period to characterize changes in water quality during filter ripening in addition influent and effluent doc uv254 and uv280 were quantified as surrogates for overall aromatic and protein like organic content respectively weishaar et al 2003 li et al 2016 in general filter backwash had no significant impact on water quality parameters which remained stable during the filter ripening period as monitored for three hours post backwash at both locations it should be noted that influent doc 2 2 mg l at wtp a was approximately half of that observed at wtp b influent do at wtp a was on average 36 higher due to the low ozone dose 1 mg l during pre treatment however biofilters at wtp b consumed more dissolved oxygen 7 and achieved greater organics removal in terms of doc 7 uv254 13 and uv280 11 likely due to higher doc and the availability of biodegradable organic carbon in lake simcoe water source water doc was unable to be efficiently removed by biofilters at wtp a due to its high content of recalcitrant carbon zhao et al 2019 even though ozone was implemented as pre treatment to increase biodegradability yavich et al 2004 as shown in table 3 influent water at both plants had similar suva254 values which has previously been correlated with thm formation upon chlorination edzwald et al 1985 however suva280 values were on average two times higher at wtp b table 3 suggesting that the influent exhibited more protein like character per unit concentration of organic carbon possibly attributing to its greater biodegradability relative to that of wtp a 3 2 impact of backwash on tatp levels total atp tatp measurements were performed for influent effluent and backwash waste samples fig 1 and s1 in general results indicate that full scale biofilter at two locations even though operated and backwashed with different strategies reacted similarly during filter ripening with respect to tatp levels influent tatp levels decreased with time whereas effluent tatp levels spiked temporarily before stabilizing statistical comparisons show that neither filter run time or ebct had a significant impact on effluent tatp during the filter ripening p value 0 05 table 2 and s1 bacterial abundance and community composition of biofilms on the surface of gac media depend on a variety of operational parameters including nutrient availability ebct filter run time and backwash regime gerrity et al 2018 liao et al 2013 emelko et al 2006 filter backwash may be used to remove excess biofilm on the surface of filter media leading to a 15 40 loss of biomass kasuga et al 2007 miltner et al 1995 and prevent head loss buildup this could explain the high tatp levels of 680 66 ng l and 4151 1145 ng l in the backwash waste sampled at wtp a and wtp b respectively fig 1 the loss of biomass attributed to backwash at wtp b was likely associated with the use of chlorinated backwash water as a result influent samples collected immediately post backwash which represent the backwash remnant contained not only particles but also biofilm material and tatp the remnant tatp level in the influent at 0 min post backwash was 157 57 ng l at wtp a for wtp b tatp level spiked to 2284 1384 ng l at 10 min post backwash fig 1 the impact of the backwash remnant declined over time due to the continued mixing of remnant water and fresh influent water in the upper region of the filter box influent tatp levels decreased over time and stabilized to pre backwash levels effluent tatp levels at the two wtps exhibited similar trends following backwash at wtp a effluent tatp increased from a pre backwash level of 8 6 ng l peaking to 59 18 ng l at 6 min post backwash then reaching a steady state level of 5 3 ng l following approximately 60 min of operation similarly at wtp b effluent tatp increased from 14 9 ng l prior to backwash and peaked to 555 134 ng l at 20 min post backwash then decreased to 48 15 ng l following 90 min of operation and remained stable until 180 min fig 1 the temporary increase in total atp in biofilter effluent could be caused by the breakthrough of backwash remnant water that was retained in the filter box above the media as well as in the pore space of the media effluent tatp peaks occurred at 4 6 min wtp a and 10 min wtp b after the remnant tatp peaks in the influent fig s1 which agree well with the approximate hydraulic residence time of the full scale biofilters at both wtp a 5 2 min and wtp b 8 2 min respectively the theoretical hydraulic residence time i e the time it takes for the water to travel through the fixed bed of media was estimated by using a porosity of 0 43 as previously calculated for the calgon f300 gac effective size 0 8 1 mm by mckie et al 2019b total atp levels at the end of a filter cycle i e prior to backwash were measured to examine the detachment of microorganisms during steady state operation results show that effluent tatp levels were significantly higher than those observed in the influent at both facilities paired one tailed t tests with 95 significance level p value 0 01 indicating loss of biofilm from the media release of tatp during biofilter operation was also observed by di tommaso et al 2019 likely resulting from hydrodynamic shear in the filter zhu et al 2010 furthermore tatp levels in the effluent and remnant impacted influent were generally higher at wtp b than those at wtp a possibly owing to the higher atp levels on the biofilter media table 1 3 3 impact of backwash on nitrogenous dbp precursors ufc fp tests were performed on biofilter influent and effluent to assess ripening in terms of ndma precursor concentrations results are presented in fig 2 typically higher ndma fp levels were observed at wtp b which corresponds to the higher protein like organic content as estimated by suva280 and higher doc in contrast to post backwash tatp trends biofilters at the two wtps behaved differently with respect to the elevated ndma fp in the remnant impacted influent during filter ripening this could not be attributed to ebcts or filter run time as neither lead to significant differences in ndma fp p value 0 05 table 2 and s1 at either location prior to backwash ndma fp in wtp a influent was 3 5 0 9 ng l ndma fp increased to 8 1 2 6 ng l as a result of the impact of backwash remnants immediately post backwash i e 0 min then gradually stabilized to 4 2 0 9 ng l at a run time of 180 min fig 2a similar to samples collected prior to backwash influent ndma fp in trial 1 reached stability faster likely due to the lower ebct backwash had no impact on effluent ndma fp which remained stable at 2 5 0 6 ng l during filter ripening at wtp b an elevated ndma fp of 67 3 23 1 ng l was observed at 10 min post backwash in the remnant impacted influent during filter ripening influent ndma fp decreased by 40 60 in the first 60 min of operation as new influent water mixed with backwash remnant water and travelled through the filter influent ndma stabilized to 11 9 3 ng l at 180 min fig 2b comparable to prior to backwash levels 11 2 2 5 ng l significantly lower ndma fp 2 2 1 8 ng l was observed in the effluent immediately post backwash because it represents the unused chlorinated backwash water remaining in the effluent pipes and or underdrain region chlorine has been identified in previous studies as an effective oxidant to reduce ndma precursors selbes et al 2014 shen and andrews 2013 subsequently effluent ndma increased to 14 8 4 2 ng l at 30 min post backwash prior to gradually decreasing to 6 1 0 6 ng l following 180 min of operation one possible explanation for the spikes in effluent post backwash ndma precursor levels at wtp b could be breakthrough of particulate ndma precursors from the remnant impacted influent which is further discussed in section 3 4 higher precursor levels in the feed water during the last filter cycle as demonstrated by influent ndma fp prior to backwash were associated with those in the remnant impacted influent at wtp b fig 2b irrespective the magnitude shape and duration of the ndma fp effluent increase appeared to be independent of precursor concentrations in the feed or remnant impacted influent water ndma fp removal δndma fp by biofiltration at both wtps is shown in fig 3 greater removal of ndma fp was observed within the first 10 min post backwash for both plants suggesting that ndma precursors in the remnant impacted influent were primarily associated with particulates that were collected by the media upon filter restart steady state δndma fp reached 3 1 0 5 ng l at 30 min post backwash for wtp a and 6 6 1 1 ng l at 120 min of operation for wtp b in addition to ndma fp han4 fp was also measured in each influent effluent and the backwash sample collected all results were below detection limits 0 8 μg l at wtp a at wtp b dcan fp in the biofilter effluent decreased from 1 5 0 2 μg l immediately post backwash to below the detection level of 0 8 μg l following 10 min of operation fig 4 however han4 was not observed in any influent or backwash samples suggesting that han precursors in the biofilter may not be associated with particulate matter perez and susa 2017 hypothesized that microorganisms would produce aromatic proteins such as tryptophan in stressed environments i e the presence of chlorine to consume chlorine and reduce cell contact this suggests that the observed dcan fp in the biofilter effluent could potentially result from the reaction between free chlorine in the backwash water and dcan precursors produced by microorganisms in gac media pore spaces the decreasing dcan post backwash corresponds to the hydraulic washout of the pore space water containing dcan that was formed during backwash 3 4 contributions of dissolved and particulate ndma precursors in order to further characterize the impact of backwash remnant water two additional replicate samples were collected from the influent at 0 min 10 min and 20 min post backwash as well as of the backwash waste at both locations trials 2 6 to examine the contribution of particulate ndma precursors including precursors adsorbed to particulates and dissolved ndma precursors to influent ndma fp mitch and sedlak 2004 performed size separation of ndma precursors in municipal wastewater effluent and reported that particle associated ndma precursors are typically 0 7 μm as such the replicates were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter prior to chloramination fp tests in order to separate dissolved from particulate precursors particulate ndma precursors total ndma fp dissolved ndma fp contributed an average 48 of the total ndma fp in the backwash waste at wtp a fig 5 after the biofilter was placed back into service particulate ndma precursors accounted for 9 24 average 18 of the total ndma fp in the influent during the first 20 min of filter operation indicating that the backwash at wtp a was effective in removing particulate ndma precursors in contrast at wtp b the contribution of particulate ndma precursors in the backwash waste represented on average 79 of the total ndma fp particulate precursors remained to be the dominant contributor of ndma fp in the post backwash influent with 78 observed in the remnant impacted influent at 0 min decreasing to 65 at 20 min post backwash the substantial contribution of particulate ndma precursors at wtp b could be attributed to particulate associated organic nitrogen including bacterially sourced organic matter that detached from the biofilm during backwash which exhibited higher ndma yields when compared to dissolved organic nitrogen as reported by hu et al 2016 moreover particle associated ndma precursors could also be contributed by ndma precursors that adsorbed onto colloids or particulate compounds in the backwash remnant water the adsorption of dissolved ndma precursors was potentially enhanced due to the charge neutralization of particulate matter by coagulation takeuchi et al 2018 3 5 correlation between tatp and ndma precursor concentration elevated levels of tatp and ndma fp were observed in the post backwash remnant impacted influent at both wtps and correlations between tatp and dissolved ndma fp as well as particulate ndma fp total ndma fp dissolved ndma fp for samples collected during and immediately following the backwash were calculated an r2 coefficient of determination value of 0 93 was observed between tatp and particulate ndma fp fig 6 a however the filtered influent samples representing dissolved ndma fp showed a low correlation r2 0 51 with tatp fig 6 b as such detached particulates which may contain biofilm related materials or adsorbed organics may be considered the primary contributors of particle associated ndma fp in the backwash remnant further research is required to establish which component s of the detached particulates are responsible for the ndma fp however the strong correlation shown in fig 6a suggests that tatp could serve as a useful indicator regardless of their presence in biofilter influent shortly after backwash detached particulates were well removed when the biofilters were returned to service a similar comparison of tatp and ndma fp profiles of post backwash biofilter effluent indicated that they are not well correlated following biofiltration r2 0 53 data not shown the tatp entering the biofilters increased post backwash at both plants whereas effluent ndma fp either remained stable wtp a or spiked 10 min later than influent tatp wtp b the low ndma fp concentrations in the effluent samples were likely the main factor that made these statistical comparisons challenging 4 conclusions recent studies have reported that biofiltration may contribute to n dbp formation due to the sloughing of biofilm this full scale study examined post backwash biofilter ripening in terms of the potential release of biofilm related materials and n dbp fp in the effluent at two water treatment plants the following conclusions are drawn elevated ndma fp and tatp levels observed in the backwash waste and remnant impacted influent at both plants likely originated from extracellular material and source organic matter during backwash however effluent ndma fp was consistently lower than that in the influent indicating effective removal of ndma precursors regardless of the filter ripening process tatp peaks in filter effluent were observed post backwash at both wtps the occurrence of which agreed with the hydraulic residence time of the corresponding full scale biofilters temporary increases of effluent ndma fp were only observed during filter ripening at wtp b likely due to the breakthrough of particle associated ndma precursors in the backwash remnant which may include bacterially associated particulate matter as well as dissolved precursors that were adsorbed onto particulate matter further research is required to characterize bacterially sourced particulate ndma precursors variations in filter ebct and filter run time did not lead to a significant difference in effluent ndma fp or tatp levels during filter ripening however source water quality pre treatment strategy backwash procedure and the use of chlorinated backwash water could attribute to the formation of n dbps and the release of biofilm related compounds in biofilter effluent post backwash declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
