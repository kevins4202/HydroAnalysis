16345,this research evaluated the performance of reactive electrochemical ceramic membrane rem in treating secondary effluent and investigated the fate of dissolved organic matter dom at the molecular level the role of adsorption electrosorption and oxidation in dom removal was comprehensively elucidated based on fluorescence spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms among the fluorescence components c1 c3 in secondary effluent microbial humic like c2 showed fewer adsorption on the rem surface without applying an electrical potential the electrosorption helped an enhanced uptake of all dom components and transformed them onto the electrode surface the fluorescence components and all three fractions hydrophilic transphilic and hydrophobic were rapidly degraded and finished water with stable dom was obtained the leading degradation phenomena were the change of the unsaturated compounds to the aliphatic and transformation of large sized molecules to medium and small sized ones above 70 of the compounds in the secondary effluent acted as precursors which were mineralized degraded and transformed products were found on the rem surface and in the finished water the compounds containing sulfur chos were easily and preferably degraded mineralized followed by the compounds containing nitrogen chon and cho the oxidation of dom led to the extensive formation of organo chlorinated compounds which contributed above 80 in products overall the combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms provided unique behavior of dom in the secondary effluent toward electro oxidation in the rem system these findings could help explore the potential of rem for different water matrices to project the possible composition of dom in the finished water

effluent from biological wastewater treatment plants contains refractory organic compounds of different chemical classes with diverse structures chen et al 2017 michael kordatou et al 2015 dissolved organic matter dom containing refractory emerging organic compounds natural organic matter and biopolymers could promote toxicity and play a role in pollutant binding and changing the bioavailability of metals in aquatic systems mathon et al 2021 walpen et al 2020 the unintentional or uncontrolled discharge of secondary effluent into the source drinking water poses serious engineering problems at the drinking water treatment plants that challenge potable water safety kasuga et al 2020 li et al 2019 electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop has recently been found as an effective approach for the treatment of secondary effluent to mitigate the refractory organic compounds garcia segura et al 2015 mameda et al 2018 ouarda et al 2020 abundant studies are available on the developments of electrodes toward the improved performance of eaops ganzenko et al 2021 yang et al 2021 numerous materials and composites have been tried to synthesize the electrodes to effectively treat refractory organic compounds li et al 2021 j wang et al 2018 recently the porous anodes made of ceramic materials as reactive electrochemical membranes rem have been introduced which overcome the barrier of low convection based mass transfer in conventional impermeable electrodes trellu et al 2018a zhi et al 2020 in this regard the use of magnéli phase ti4o7 rem is significant ti4o7 behaves as a typical non active anode producing free hydroxyl radicals oh via water oxidation and is also active for direct electron transfer reactions zaky and chaplin 2013 because of high conductivity robustness in aggressive solutions and a wide electrochemical window for water decomposition 1 20 v and 2 9 v vs she ti4o7 based anodes have gained higher interest for water and wastewater treatment applications wang et al 2020 rem based water treatment is emerging and applications are being found in different waters to date available researches are mostly focused on developing anodes and treating single refractory compound in simple water matrices lin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the studies on complicated and real water matrices are scarce which could highlight the real potential of rem toward the removal of different chemical structures altogether ganzenko et al 2021 qian et al 2021 lin et al 2021 found rem systems effective for the treatment of landfill leachate and the performance of ti4o7 based anode was found superior than few other electrodes magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode was also reported effective for the treatment of industrial wastewater wang et al 2021 dom in secondary effluent is composed of thousands of ill defined compounds with varying elemental composition and chemical properties dom can be classified into carbohydrates phenols polyphenols aliphatic hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons phungsai et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a 2021b understanding the fate of dom in emerging treatment systems is important to determine their suitability for the application at a large scale and possible outcomes focusing on the environmental and health perspectives at present the spectroscopic approach fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography are being employed to understand the changes in fluorophores aromaticity and molecular weight respectively hu and ren 2016 tang et al 2021 yang et al 2015 these approaches could only provide the general overview of dom and some useful indicators to control the quality of water lavonen et al 2015 maqbool et al 2020a 2020b shi et al 2021 nevertheless it is beyond the capability of conventional analytical approaches to elucidate the detailed changes at the molecular level in different classes of the dom upon oxidation or other water treatment processes for instance in eaops the dom removal is achieved by three leading phenomena i adsorption electrosorption ii degradation on the electrode surface and iii radical based oxidation in the water phase liu and vecitis 2012 trellu et al 2018b zaky and chaplin 2013 however no study has systematically determined the role of leading phenomena in dom transformation at the molecular level in a real water matrix the rising interest in rem based water wastewater leachate treatment demands a detailed investigation of the fate of dom and its distribution into precursors transformed products and resistant compounds the ultra high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer ft icr ms has demonstrated immense potential for determining thousands of distinct compounds in different waters including drinking water secondary effluent and leachate chen et al 2021 cortés francisco et al 2014 gonsior et al 2011 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a ft icr ms has helped unravel the molecular level changes in dom during oxidation processes gao et al 2021 zhang et al 20 21a zhang et al 2019 the combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms could help in easy online monitoring of the performance of oxidation systems and the in depth fate of different dom molecules in water matrix lavonen et al 2015 shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 this study shed light on the feasibility of using magnéli phase ti4o7 based rem to treat secondary effluent the performance of rem was determined in terms of dynamics of fluorescence dom fmax through excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac the unexplored fate of dom in the eaop rem system was systemically answered by ft icr ms the relative reactivity and removal of different dom fractions hydrophilic transphilic and hydrophobic were also elucidated a comprehensive comparison between the electrically and non electrically operated rem was made to obtain the distribution of thousands of compounds in adsorption electrosorption and degradation on the rem surface as well as in the water phase through radicals the distribution of the compounds based on the molecular weight mw aromaticity index aimod double bond equivalent dbe nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc and o c vs o h provided the association of the compounds to distinct classes it demonstrated the reactivity or adsorption of dom at the molecular level 2 material and method 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions experiments were performed using a lab scale commercial ti4o7 rem and experimental setup with its schematic diagram are shown in supplementary fig s1 rem with the dimensions of 38 mm diameter and 140 mm length was placed in a cylindrical glass reactor 130 ml a pure ti mesh enclosing the rem was used as the cathode the inter electrode distance was maintained to 4 mm and a quartz ring was used as an insulator between the electrodes the rem was operated at an outside to inside cross flow filtration mode the impacts of different current densities i e 2 5 and 10 ma cm2 and volumetric fluxes i e 1000 1500 and 2000 lmh on the removal of secondary effluent were evaluated each cycle of secondary treatment was comprised of 30 min filtration time after a specified time interval 5 ml of sample was drawn and replaced with 5 ml of raw secondary effluent to keep the working volume same 130 ml the role of adsorption and electrosorption in secondary effluent removal was estimated by operating the rem system in two different conditions i e with vs without electric potential the naoh ph 12 solution in milli q water was used to extract the adsorbed and electrosorped dom from the rem surface working without and with electrical potential respectively briefly the rem electrode was placed in naoh solution 130 ml ph 12 and backwashed for 30 min the naoh solution containing dom fraction was used to characterize organics adsorbed electrosorped on the rem surface before the next run rem was rinsed with milli q water and placed in the oven at 60 c for 30 min 2 2 secondary effluent the secondary effluent was collected from a municipal biological wastewater treatment plant located in the same city the secondary effluent was employed for the experiments without any ph adjustment or addition of buffer solution or any quenching agent however the secondary effluent was pre filtered using a 0 45 µm cellulose triacetate membrane filter advantec tokyo japan the basic quality parameters of secondary effluent are provided in supplementary table s1 the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn toc v shimadzu japan were calculated after subtracting the amount of organic traces leached from the rem electrode the background doc was calculated using milli q and electrolyte na2so4 1 ms cm at the current density of 10 ma cm2 in the rem system 2 3 resin fractionation the resin fractionation was performed to obtain hydrophilic hpi transphilic tpi and hydrophobic hpo fractions of secondary effluent supplementary fig s2 two types of resins dax 8 and xad 4 procured from bellancom life science china were used for hpo and tpi fractions respectively the resins were sequentially rinsed with 0 1 m naoh methanol acetonitrile and methanol for 24 h each details are provided elsewhere yoo et al 2016 two glass columns were filled with the resins and prepared according to the method proposed yoo et al 2016 before the fractionation the ph of the secondary effluent was adjusted to 2 0 with 0 1 m hcl the secondary effluent with the flow rate of 1 5 2 0 ml min 1 sequentially passed through dax 8 and xad 4 the hpo dax 8 and tpi xad 4 adsorbed fractions were extracted using 100 ml of 0 1 m naoh solution and the final effluent was denoted as the hpi fraction the hpi is a dom fraction that passed both of dax 8 and xad 4 resins and was not adsorbed on any resin before the degradation experiment the ph of all dom fractions was adjusted similar to that of raw secondary effluent the dom fractions were separately treated in rem system and the kinetics of degradation were compared using fluorescence spectroscopy 2 4 excitation emission matrix before the spectroscopic characterization the ph of all water samples was adjusted to 7 0 the uv vis spectra uv2600 shimadzu japan were collected to confirm the absorption value less than 0 05 a u at 254 nm of wavelength to avoid any inner filter effect in fluorescence spectra otherwise samples were diluted accordingly fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan was used to collect a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem the filtered samples were used to collect eems spectra using the same four sided transparent quartz cuvette three dimensional eems were collected with the following adjusted parameters excitation ex and emission em wavelength ranges were set at 220 500 nm and 240 550 nm with wavelength steps of 5 nm and 1 nm respectively the scan speed and slits sizes were 30 000 nm min and 10 nm for both ex and em respectively the eems of milli q water were measured as blanks and were subtracted from that of the water samples collected 2 5 parafac modeling the parafac modeling was applied on combined eems datasets n 180 including raw secondary effluent finished water and naoh based extracted dom from the rem surface the modeling was performed using the domflour toolbox in matlab 13 0 mathworks inc usa by following the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 following are the steps for modeling i removing water scattering ii applying the non negativity constraints iii loading leverage iv identifying and removing the outliers if any and v split half analysis validation for a suitable number of components fmax was used to represent maximum fluorescence intensity for an individual component and fmax was normalized for inter laboratory comparison using the raman integration method lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 6 epr spectra electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker x band 5000 germany was used to track oh by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent the magnetic field was modulated at 100 khz with a power supply of 2 2 mw the center field was 3480 00 g with a sweep width of 100 0 g 2 7 solid phase extraction the solid phase extraction spe cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 g 6 ml were used to extract dom from samples including the raw secondary effluent finished water and naoh based extracted adsorbed electrosorped dom on the rem surface while operating with and without electric potential the spe process is described elsewhere dittmar et al 2008 zhang et al 2021b briefly the cartridges were rinsed and activated with methanol 12 ml and 0 01 m hcl solution 12 ml 500 ml of each water sample was passed through the cartridge with a 5 ml min 1 flow speed the volume of samples was kept constant for pseudo quantitative comparison then the cartridges were rinsed with 18 ml of 0 01 m hcl to remove salts and gently dried the cartridges using n2 gas the dom retained in cartridges was eluted using 12 ml of methanol the volume of the methanol was reduced to 1 ml using an n2 concentrator and samples were stored at 20 c before ft icr ms measurements 2 8 ft icr ms analysis ft icr ms bruker solarix germany equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an electrospray ionization esi source operated in negative mode was used to analyze the dom composition the main operating parameters were continuous injection with a flow speed of 120 µl h 1 capillary inlet voltage was set to 3 8 kv the ion accumulation time was 0 06 s and the mass range was 100 1600 m z the instrument was calibrated using a 10 mm sodium formate solution all possible formulas were identified with bruker data analysis software and homemade software the molecular formula calculation was based on the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 1h1 120 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 31p0 2 35cl0 3 and the peaks with the signal to noise s n ratio 5 were employed for calculation if an m z value observed m z corresponds to multiple possible molecular formulas the homologous series approach analysis based on ch2 for above 500 da and the minimum number of hetero atoms rule n s p and cl were used to screen out the correct molecular formulas hao et al 2017 ruan et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 for a given chemical formula the difference between the calculated mass and the measured one was less than one ppm few indices dbe aimod and nosc were calculated as described in j zhang et al 2021 the dom components were categorized into five compound classes based on the following criteria 1 poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs aimod 0 66 2 polyphenols polyp 0 66 aimod 50 3 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds huph aimod 0 50 and h c 1 5 4 aliphatic compounds aliph 1 5 h c 2 and 5 carbohydrate compounds carbo h c 2 the ft icr ms spectra were also divided into three molecular size groups i e high mw 450 m z medium mw 300 450 m z and low mw 300 m z fractions 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance evaluation of rem using fluorescence spectroscopy before the performance evaluation of rem a blank milli q water was treated in the system organic traces with slight uv adsorption were detected the source of organic traces was the organic binder used during the synthesis of rem interestingly these traces have not shown any fluorescence peak therefore fluorescence spectroscopy was employed as a performance evaluation tool in this study however doc and tn removal kinetics are presented in supplementary fig s3 rem system efficiently removed doc and tn up to 96 and 70 respectively in a previous rem based treatment removal of tn was associated with the amount of cl ion available in the background with the reduction of total organic nitrogen ton above 85 lin et al 2021 a three component model was well fitted on the combined eems which provided tryptophan like c1 microbial humic like c2 and tyrosine like c3 components fig 1 maqbool et al 2017 yang et al 2015 although the inter component comparison is not associated with the relative concentration of contents in the secondary effluent the distribution of fluorescence components was calculated to c1 64 5 c2 17 5 and c3 18 0 the distribution of fluorescent components was typical and matching has been reported abundantly in the literature on secondary effluent treatment lyu et al 2021 ruscalleda et al 2014 the c1 and c3 represented the aromatic microbial products released as effluent organic matter efom in secondary effluent while c2 is generally associated with humic substances formed due to microbial humification in biological wastewater treatment systems coble 2007 cohen et al 2014 ly et al 2018 maqbool et al 2017 stedmon et al 2007 the kinetics of the fluorescence components during secondary effluent treatment in rem are presented in fig 2 and the comparison was drawn between the working conditions with vs without electrical potential of rem in electrically operated rem the highest removal was noted for c2 98 followed by c1 96 and c3 91 while comparing the results of fluorescence components removal in both conditions the higher removal of c2 could be ascribed to its higher adsorption on the rem surface the adsorption of fluorescence components on the rem surface working without electrical potential was recorded as 2 7 15 4 and 3 2 for c1 c2 and c3 respectively the relatively higher adsorption of c2 microbial humic like could be justified due to the enrichment of condensed aromatic structures in the humic like component and higher relatively negative charge on such dom fraction which promoted the electrostatic interaction hu et al 2021 truong et al 2021 the rem showed remarkable performance in removing dom from the secondary effluent with minimal adsorption and the role of electrical potential was significant compared to the impermeable electrode the ti4o7 rem has efficiently removed dom with mild current density conditions 2 10 ma cm2 ouarda et al 2020 the impact of the current density on the removal of dom was also investigated and presented in fig 2 b except for the c3 the insignificant difference in the removal of c1 and c2 was noted for operation at different current densities the c3 removal was increased from 70 at 2 ma cm2 to 91 at 10 ma cm2 overall slight improved finished water was obtained referring to the increase in direct electron transfer and generation of oh at increasing current densities ganzenko et al 2021 trellu et al 2018b the generation of oh in rem was confirmed through dmpo spin trapping epr spectra supplementary fig s4 the convection enhanced mass transport to the surface of rem has been reported as a critical factor to remove organics in rem based treatment zaky and chaplin 2014 as reported in previous studies the volumetric flux has shown a direct relationship between the flux and removal of organics ganzenko et al 2021 lin et al 2021 however no significant difference was noted in this study between the removal of fluorescence components and the flux as shown in fig 2 c the removal of c1 c2 and c3 were recorded to be 94 1 vs 93 9 99 3 vs 99 4 and 94 6 vs 94 4 at membrane flux of 1000 vs 2000 lmh respectively the commercial rem used in this study showed robust performance in removing dom without the influence of flux the stability of rem was tested in a 10 cycles repetition experiment and consistent performance in removing fluorescence components was noted fig 2 d the highest removal remained constant for c1 99 and least for the c3 90 it shows the robust synthesis of rem at a commercial scale and the potential to use it for large scale applications during the repetition experiment the dom adsorbed on the rem surface were extracted using naoh ph 12 and the composition of the electosorped dom is also provided in fig 2 d although a significant difference was noted among the fmax of each fluorescence component it indicated that the degradation on the rem surface followed the preference of adsorption of different fluorescence components the treatability of different dom fractions i e hpi tpi and hpo was also tested in the rem system and the results are presented in fig 3 in all dom fractions the tryptophan like c1 component was present with the highest share and its enrichment was found in the order of hpi hpo tpi on the other hand c2 with reasonable fmax was only detected in hpo fraction followed by the slight tpi fraction and negligible hpi fraction the electro oxidation was found to be non selective and rem successfully degraded all dom fractions the higher removal of c1 could be ascribed to its extensive hydrophilic nature the comparison of the adsorbed fraction showed that c2 was found minimal in the treatment of dom fractions supplementary fig s5 it can be deduced from the results that c2 was highly adsorbed on the rem surface oxidation on the rem surface preferred humic like substances lin et al 2021 from comparing the dynamics of fluorescence dom and toc in rem systems it is inferred that fluorescence moieties are more sensitive to oxidation than the compounds without fluorescence previous studies have also reported a noticeable difference in the kinetics of with vs without fluorescence emitting dom during aops treatment ahn et al 2017 maqbool et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the eem parafac modeling results indicate that the ti4o7 rem can degrade the dom and provide a stable secondary effluent above this general depiction of dom removal in rem it was considered of immense importance to study the detailed changes at the molecular level in dom and determine the role of leading phenomena in removing different components and their transformation 3 2 characterization of dom using ft icr ms the assigned formulas in secondary effluent were mostly found in 200 to 700 m z fig 4 the compounds with higher intensities were located within the mw of 250 to 400 m z and this region contained 39 of the total compounds the mw range 250 to 400 m z with significant intensities was consistent among the raw secondary effluent and finished water from the rem systems working with or without electrical potential similar molecular size distribution in secondary effluent was also reported previously gonsior et al 2011 wang et al 2018b compared to the influent a minute reduction in relative intensities was detected in the finished water from rem working without electrical potential in line with fluorescence spectroscopy results fig 2 the electrically operated rem remarkably diminished the relative intensity and chemical diversity of dom representing the substantial oxidation potential of the rem system compounds with m z 550 were almost disappeared transformation of scarce high mw compounds could be a reason for their extinction rem more or less proportionately degraded the compounds throughout the esi spectra regardless of m z the compounds adsorbed electrosorped on the rem surface were noticeably lower than secondary effluent representing fewer adsorption electrosoprtion during the treatment supplementary fig s6 rem without electrical potential adsorbed the compounds with a relatively higher intensity in secondary effluent however several new peaks emerged in electrosorped dom fraction such emergence of new compounds could be ascribed to the transformation products formed from oxidation on the rem surface ft icr ms spectra presented a minor role of adsorption in removing dom from secondary effluent ft icr ms also helped determine the potential of rem toward oxidation or adsorption electrosorption of dom which was systematically elucidated in the following discussion 3 3 compositional changes in dom the composition of dom was noticeably different in the finished water than raw secondary effluent the dominant classes i e huph and aliph compounds remained abundant in the finished water and naoh based extracted adsorbed fractions from the rem surface in both working conditions with vs without electrical potential table 1 previous studies on the oxidation of secondary effluent also reported huph and aliph as dominant classes before and after treatment zhang et al 2021b 2021a compared to raw secondary effluent finished water from the electrically operated rem system showed a decline up to 7 in the share of huph and a concurrent increase in aliph 3 after the oxidation the rise in aliph was also reported previously zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 the mnox based oxidation of suwanee river fulvic acid srfa also showed an inverse relationship between these two chemical classes huph and aliph zhang et al 2021 the compositional changes in electrosorped dom fraction were significantly different from respective finished water and raw secondary effluent the contribution of huph vs aliph was 44 89 vs 52 35 and 67 19 vs 31 16 in elecrosorped fraction and raw secondary effluent respectively it infers that the electrically assisted adsorption electrosorption caused selective uptake of dom or transformed them on the rem surface through direct electron transfer and or radical attack wang et al 2020 the evidence of extensive transformation degradation of dom on the rem surface was also recorded in eem parafac components ft icr ms also presented the generation of several new compounds fig 5 while operating the rem without electrical potential minimal changes were recorded between the dom adsorbed on the rem surface and in finished water fig 5 a the comparison of adsorbed and electrosorped dom fractions deduced that electrical potential caused extensive direct electron transfer and or radical attack to dom on the rem surface zaky and chaplin 2014 the van krevelen diagrams presented the degradation of the compounds with high o c by rem with electrical potential fig 5 the degradation of the high o c has also been reported previously zhang et al 2021 chemicals with high o c usually are more reactive than un functionalized aliphatic which is one of the reasons for their removal by the rem system zhang et al 2021 the average o c in raw secondary effluent elecrosorped dom and finished water was recorded as 0 45 0 46 and 0 41 respectively the lower value of o c could be ascribed to the release of co2 by mineralization causing the relative depletion of oxygen in finished water however the average dbe was decreased from 7 30 to 5 74 in dom fraction from the rem surface since dbe includes all double bound carbon moieties c c and c o the decrease in dbe was caused by the cleavage of c c or aliphatic rings instead of c o of dom this means that the degree of unsaturation of dom on the rem surface was decreased lv et al 2017 the decrease in the nosc from 0 38 to 0 46 electrosorped and 0 52 finished water was also noticed the oh addition and cleavage of the c c were seemed to be dominant oxidation modes in degradation and mineralization of the high mw water phase unlike the finished water the dom electrosorped showed substantial reduction 48 in aimod representing severe oxidation on the rem surface through direct electron transfer and or radical attack zaky and chaplin 2013 noticeable changes in average mw of dom were recorded among the raw secondary effluent and other dom fractions from the rem systems table 1 the raw secondary effluent was mainly composed of the high and medium mw 90 high mw 43 and medium mw 51 which changed to 24 and 62 for high mw and medium mw respectively in finished water from the rem system operated under electrical potential reduction in mw was also noted in the electrosorped fraction of dom with average changes from 445 to 394 m z the reduction in the high mw of dom indicated the transformation of the larger molecules to medium electrosoped 57 6 and finished water 62 2 and low mw fractions electrosorped 13 4 and finished wate 14 5 of dom selectivity of rem with vs without electric potential toward the compounds with specific elemental composition was noticeable in both adsorbed electrosorped and finished water table 1 and supplementary fig s7 dom in electrosorped fraction was dominated with the cho compounds which increased from 32 in raw secondary effluent to 56 the cho composition potentially represents the lignin aromatic polymer and lipids in the effluent zhang et al 2021 while the compounds containing nitrogen i e chon were found 8 in electrosorped fraction and negligible in adsorbed fraction which represented the uptake of nitrogen containing chemicals through electrostatic adsorption however chos showed the opposite trend to chon and a higher share was noted in adsorbed fraction 67 than that electrosorped 30 the extraordinary difference for chos between adsorbed and electrosorped fractions could be ascribed to the easy oxidation of sulfur containing moieties the decrease in cumulative peak intensities of chos on the rem surface and in the finished water was 92 and 82 respectively these results inferred that applying electrical potential brought about substantial changes in the adsorption phenomena of the rem system by involving electrostatic interaction and direct electron transfer and or radical attack in short the cho followed the adsorption route to attach to the surface however electrostatic potential enhanced the uptake of chon and transformed the chos on the rem surface the dominant chemical classes were different in the finished water compared to those on the rem surface the cho compounds were increased from 32 to 45 and the chos compounds were extraordinarily decreased from 56 to 20 while organo chlorinated compounds cl dom were increased from 3 to 31 in the finished water it is important to mention that the raw secondary effluent contained 70 mg l of cl which could be potentially transformed to chlorate perchlorate it also generated activated chlorine species which assisted the formation of cl dom in the rem system the evidence of the generation of organo chlorinated compounds in rem systems was also provided in previous studies ganzenko et al 2021 wang et al 2020 this study found that cl dom compounds are hydrophilic and constituted the main share of finished water and the lightly electrosorped on the rem surface 3 4 the role of phosphorus containing dom p dom was minimal in the rem system 3 4 precursor and resistant compounds a large number of compounds 74 in raw secondary effluent acted as precursors for electro oxidation table 2 and fig 6 the system showed that less than 27 of compounds of secondary effluent were resistive toward complete degradation however a substantial reduction in such compounds was also recorded table 2 it is important to mention that the dom precursors represent the compounds that fully degraded after the oxidation reaction another study showed around 10 50 of compounds in raw secondary effluent as precursors during the oxidation process zhang et al 2021b the distribution of precursors in terms of chemical structures showed huph as the main class of compounds to be oxidized transformed or mineralized on the rem surface 70 as well as in the water phase 69 table 2 and fig 6 the aliph 27 28 as precursors followed the share of huph however pahs and polyph were also fully consumed the preference of the different classes as precursors also followed the relative abundance in the raw secondary effluent in the group of resistant molecular compounds enrichment of aliph compounds showed a relatively higher tendency toward degradation than huph compounds which was also reported previously zhang et al 2021 the cleavage of the c c and aliphatic rings with electron donating capacity seems to be the priority oxidation mode of the huph which was also depicted from the change of dbe fig 7 the majority of the carbohydrate was also equally oxidized on the rem surface and in the water phase likewise the distribution of mw in influent the precursors on the rem surface and in the water phase were also composed of the high to medium mw fraction with relatively equal shares table 2 and fig 7 previous research admitted and proved that the oxidation process transformed the large mw fractions to medium or small sized ones chen et al 2020 lv et al 2017 in electro oxidation process high mw compounds were found less resistive than the medium mw and low mw the abundant chos based compounds in raw secondary effluent acted as the leading precursors 60 63 during the oxidation on the rem surface and in the water phase table 2 however the other major contributor in influent i e cho showed the least share 17 in the group of precursors than the actual amount therefore the resistant group compounds were enriched in cho 44 followed by chos 50 53 the recent literature on the oxidation of dom and characterization through ft icr ms also justified the result which presented the sulfur containing moieties as most vulnerable to be oxidized followed by nitrogen containing moieties zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 a matching distribution of precursors different compositional classes was observed between the dom extracted from the rem surface and present in finished water 3 5 dom products the dom produced by the rem system differed significantly from the precursors available in raw secondary effluent table 2 figs 6 and 7 the extraordinary difference in the composition was recorded on the rem surface the oxidation on the rem surface showed less presence of the huph 14 while abundant aliph 79 compared to the enriched huph 70 and moderate aliph 27 in the precursors such inverse changes showed the transformation of the huph to aliph compounds on the rem surface being the class of the dominant compound in raw secondary effluent huph was also found abundant as the resistant finished water showed relatively less significant changes between the composition of dom in precursors and products although the number of precursor compounds was three times higher than the products up to 9 declination in huph share was recorded between the precursors from the secondary effluent and the finished water containing new compounds it deduced that the produced aliph were mostly hydrophobic compounds and found adsorbed on the rem surface and less in the finished water interestingly the same amount of compounds was found as precursors and the resistants in the water phase and on the rem surface which indicated the vulnerability of the similar molecules to direct electron transfer or radical based oxidation on the other hand electrosorped fraction was found less than 50 of the dom formed in finished water mineralization and desorption from the rem surface could be the probable reasons unlike the oxidation on the rem surface slight generation of pahs and polyph was noted in finished water table 2 and fig 6 on the contrary to the oxidation on the rem surface products in finished water were enriched with medium sized 60 mw followed by the low mw 12 indicating the transformation of large size molecules and which could also be linked to the insufficient oxidation of the huph fig 7 it inferred that rem trapped the large sized compounds caused their extensive oxidation and changed them to medium and low mw fractions among the different classes chos showed higher electron donating capacity of which the contribution was decreased from 60 precursors to 6 products on the rem surface and 63 precursors to 1 products in permeate the minimal generation of chos products on rem surface and finished water inferred that desulfonation was not the leading mechanism but some other oxidative desulfonation reactions would happen zhang et al 2021a the behavior of chon was interesting which was visually transformed with few resistant 1 but substantial was formed in products 34 in the dom fraction extracted from the rem surface while in the water phase the chon compounds were extensively transformed to the other classes of dom with possibilities to cho and cl dom the emergence of the extraordinary share of cl dom 81 highlighted the role of chlorides in the secondary effluent ganzenko et al 2021 wang et al 2020 3 6 limitations of ft icr ms and challenges of rem ft icr ms was found effective in providing the comprehensive details of dom in secondary effluent however the potential limitations of ft icr ms in our study would include i extraction efficiency of spe toward different dom components ii potential changes in dom structure by acidifying to ph 2 3 and slight generation of chlorinated compounds iii competitiveness of esi which is independent of analyte concentration and suppression of less efficiently ionizable compounds chen et al 2021 dittmar et al 2008 he and hur 2015 lavonen et al 2013 the reproducibility of esi for the high resolution mass spectrometry of dom in aquatic systems is also challenging hawkes et al 2020 although rem effectively degraded the dom in secondary effluent and most components disappeared after the rem treatment cl dom were produced in abundance previous studies on rem based water treatment have also shown the generation of active chlorine species due to cl in the water matrix which played a role in the degradation of organic contents ganzenko et al 2021 wang et al 2020 according to the findings of this study there is a need for a further detailed toxicological assessment of such cl dom in treated secondary effluent which warrants the rem applications on the real scale level the safety of the treated water can be evaluated through chronic toxicity and cytotoxicity tests on zebrafish and human cells 4 conclusion this study systematically determined the treatability of dom in rem systems based on fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms the fate of dom available in secondary effluent with its different components and fractions was comprehensively elucidated at the molecular level the following conclusions are drawn i all fluorescence components c1 c3 in secondary effluent showed above 90 removal in rem systems within 30 min of operation however the kinetics of the tyrosine like fluorescence was relatively slower and microbial humic like component was noticeably adsorbed on the rem surface ii the esi spectra presented 250 to 400 m z as the dominant region for the dom in secondary effluent electro oxidation degraded the large sized molecules 550 m z and new small and medium sized compounds emerged on the rem surface and in finished water iii two dominant classes i e unsaturated and phenolic huph and aliphatic compounds made above 90 of the dom in secondary effluent the decrease in the former class caused a proportional increase in the latter which was found severe on the rem surface and marginal in the water phase iv about half of the compounds were found with the composition of chos which were substantially diminished after electro oxidation leading to mineralization or transformation to other classes a similar number of molecular compounds were acted as precursors however their propensity to be degraded or mineralized was significantly different on the rem surface and in the water phase v the new dom generated after electro oxidation was 14 and 31 of the precursors at the rem surface and in the water phase respectively which showed higher mineralization of the compound diminished from the raw secondary effluent the chloride ion in secondary effluent played a magnificent role in oxidation and finished water enriched with organo chlorinated 31 was obtained our findings facilitate the understanding of the oxidation of dom in different water matrices in eaops this study could be a way forward to estimate better the possible products released in finished water so their interaction in the environment and an association to the health could be evaluated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16345,this research evaluated the performance of reactive electrochemical ceramic membrane rem in treating secondary effluent and investigated the fate of dissolved organic matter dom at the molecular level the role of adsorption electrosorption and oxidation in dom removal was comprehensively elucidated based on fluorescence spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms among the fluorescence components c1 c3 in secondary effluent microbial humic like c2 showed fewer adsorption on the rem surface without applying an electrical potential the electrosorption helped an enhanced uptake of all dom components and transformed them onto the electrode surface the fluorescence components and all three fractions hydrophilic transphilic and hydrophobic were rapidly degraded and finished water with stable dom was obtained the leading degradation phenomena were the change of the unsaturated compounds to the aliphatic and transformation of large sized molecules to medium and small sized ones above 70 of the compounds in the secondary effluent acted as precursors which were mineralized degraded and transformed products were found on the rem surface and in the finished water the compounds containing sulfur chos were easily and preferably degraded mineralized followed by the compounds containing nitrogen chon and cho the oxidation of dom led to the extensive formation of organo chlorinated compounds which contributed above 80 in products overall the combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms provided unique behavior of dom in the secondary effluent toward electro oxidation in the rem system these findings could help explore the potential of rem for different water matrices to project the possible composition of dom in the finished water

for the treatment of secondary effluent to mitigate the refractory organic compounds garcia segura et al 2015 mameda et al 2018 ouarda et al 2020 abundant studies are available on the developments of electrodes toward the improved performance of eaops ganzenko et al 2021 yang et al 2021 numerous materials and composites have been tried to synthesize the electrodes to effectively treat refractory organic compounds li et al 2021 j wang et al 2018 recently the porous anodes made of ceramic materials as reactive electrochemical membranes rem have been introduced which overcome the barrier of low convection based mass transfer in conventional impermeable electrodes trellu et al 2018a zhi et al 2020 in this regard the use of magnéli phase ti4o7 rem is significant ti4o7 behaves as a typical non active anode producing free hydroxyl radicals oh via water oxidation and is also active for direct electron transfer reactions zaky and chaplin 2013 because of high conductivity robustness in aggressive solutions and a wide electrochemical window for water decomposition 1 20 v and 2 9 v vs she ti4o7 based anodes have gained higher interest for water and wastewater treatment applications wang et al 2020 rem based water treatment is emerging and applications are being found in different waters to date available researches are mostly focused on developing anodes and treating single refractory compound in simple water matrices lin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the studies on complicated and real water matrices are scarce which could highlight the real potential of rem toward the removal of different chemical structures altogether ganzenko et al 2021 qian et al 2021 lin et al 2021 found rem systems effective for the treatment of landfill leachate and the performance of ti4o7 based anode was found superior than few other electrodes magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode was also reported effective for the treatment of industrial wastewater wang et al 2021 dom in secondary effluent is composed of thousands of ill defined compounds with varying elemental composition and chemical properties dom can be classified into carbohydrates phenols polyphenols aliphatic hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons phungsai et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a 2021b understanding the fate of dom in emerging treatment systems is important to determine their suitability for the application at a large scale and possible outcomes focusing on the environmental and health perspectives at present the spectroscopic approach fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography are being employed to understand the changes in fluorophores aromaticity and molecular weight respectively hu and ren 2016 tang et al 2021 yang et al 2015 these approaches could only provide the general overview of dom and some useful indicators to control the quality of water lavonen et al 2015 maqbool et al 2020a 2020b shi et al 2021 nevertheless it is beyond the capability of conventional analytical approaches to elucidate the detailed changes at the molecular level in different classes of the dom upon oxidation or other water treatment processes for instance in eaops the dom removal is achieved by three leading phenomena i adsorption electrosorption ii degradation on the electrode surface and iii radical based oxidation in the water phase liu and vecitis 2012 trellu et al 2018b zaky and chaplin 2013 however no study has systematically determined the role of leading phenomena in dom transformation at the molecular level in a real water matrix the rising interest in rem based water wastewater leachate treatment demands a detailed investigation of the fate of dom and its distribution into precursors transformed products and resistant compounds the ultra high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer ft icr ms has demonstrated immense potential for determining thousands of distinct compounds in different waters including drinking water secondary effluent and leachate chen et al 2021 cortés francisco et al 2014 gonsior et al 2011 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a ft icr ms has helped unravel the molecular level changes in dom during oxidation processes gao et al 2021 zhang et al 20 21a zhang et al 2019 the combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms could help in easy online monitoring of the performance of oxidation systems and the in depth fate of different dom molecules in water matrix lavonen et al 2015 shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 this study shed light on the feasibility of using magnéli phase ti4o7 based rem to treat secondary effluent the performance of rem was determined in terms of dynamics of fluorescence dom fmax through excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac the unexplored fate of dom in the eaop rem system was systemically answered by ft icr ms the relative reactivity and removal of different dom fractions hydrophilic transphilic and hydrophobic were also elucidated a comprehensive comparison between the electrically and non electrically operated rem was made to obtain the distribution of thousands of compounds in adsorption electrosorption and degradation on the rem surface as well as in the water phase through radicals the distribution of the compounds based on the molecular weight mw aromaticity index aimod double bond equivalent dbe nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc and o c vs o h provided the association of the compounds to distinct classes it demonstrated the reactivity or adsorption of dom at the molecular level 2 material and method 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions experiments were performed using a lab scale commercial ti4o7 rem and experimental setup with its schematic diagram are shown in supplementary fig s1 rem with the dimensions of 38 mm diameter and 140 mm length was placed in a cylindrical glass reactor 130 ml a pure ti mesh enclosing the rem was used as the cathode the inter electrode distance was maintained to 4 mm and a quartz ring was used as an insulator between the electrodes the rem was operated at an outside to inside cross flow filtration mode the impacts of different current densities i e 2 5 and 10 ma cm2 and volumetric fluxes i e 1000 1500 and 2000 lmh on the removal of secondary effluent were evaluated each cycle of secondary treatment was comprised of 30 min filtration time after a specified time interval 5 ml of sample was drawn and replaced with 5 ml of raw secondary effluent to keep the working volume same 130 ml the role of adsorption and electrosorption in secondary effluent removal was estimated by operating the rem system in two different conditions i e with vs without electric potential the naoh ph 12 solution in milli q water was used to extract the adsorbed and electrosorped dom from the rem surface working without and with electrical potential respectively briefly the rem electrode was placed in naoh solution 130 ml ph 12 and backwashed for 30 min the naoh solution containing dom fraction was used to characterize organics adsorbed electrosorped on the rem surface before the next run rem was rinsed with milli q water and placed in the oven at 60 c for 30 min 2 2 secondary effluent the secondary effluent was collected from a municipal biological wastewater treatment plant located in the same city the secondary effluent was employed for the experiments without any ph adjustment or addition of buffer solution or any quenching agent however the secondary effluent was pre filtered using a 0 45 µm cellulose triacetate membrane filter advantec tokyo japan the basic quality parameters of secondary effluent are provided in supplementary table s1 the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn toc v shimadzu japan were calculated after subtracting the amount of organic traces leached from the rem electrode the background doc was calculated using milli q and electrolyte na2so4 1 ms cm at the current density of 10 ma cm2 in the rem system 2 3 resin fractionation the resin fractionation was performed to obtain hydrophilic hpi transphilic tpi and hydrophobic hpo fractions of secondary effluent supplementary fig s2 two types of resins dax 8 and xad 4 procured from bellancom life science china were used for hpo and tpi fractions respectively the resins were sequentially rinsed with 0 1 m naoh methanol acetonitrile and methanol for 24 h each details are provided elsewhere yoo et al 2016 two glass columns were filled with the resins and prepared according to the method proposed yoo et al 2016 before the fractionation the ph of the secondary effluent was adjusted to 2 0 with 0 1 m hcl the secondary effluent with the flow rate of 1 5 2 0 ml min 1 sequentially passed through dax 8 and xad 4 the hpo dax 8 and tpi xad 4 adsorbed fractions were extracted using 100 ml of 0 1 m naoh solution and the final effluent was denoted as the hpi fraction the hpi is a dom fraction that passed both of dax 8 and xad 4 resins and was not adsorbed on any resin before the degradation experiment the ph of all dom fractions was adjusted similar to that of raw secondary effluent the dom fractions were separately treated in rem system and the kinetics of degradation were compared using fluorescence spectroscopy 2 4 excitation emission matrix before the spectroscopic characterization the ph of all water samples was adjusted to 7 0 the uv vis spectra uv2600 shimadzu japan were collected to confirm the absorption value less than 0 05 a u at 254 nm of wavelength to avoid any inner filter effect in fluorescence spectra otherwise samples were diluted accordingly fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan was used to collect a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem the filtered samples were used to collect eems spectra using the same four sided transparent quartz cuvette three dimensional eems were collected with the following adjusted parameters excitation ex and emission em wavelength ranges were set at 220 500 nm and 240 550 nm with wavelength steps of 5 nm and 1 nm respectively the scan speed and slits sizes were 30 000 nm min and 10 nm for both ex and em respectively the eems of milli q water were measured as blanks and were subtracted from that of the water samples collected 2 5 parafac modeling the parafac modeling was applied on combined eems datasets n 180 including raw secondary effluent finished water and naoh based extracted dom from the rem surface the modeling was performed using the domflour toolbox in matlab 13 0 mathworks inc usa by following the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 following are the steps for modeling i removing water scattering ii applying the non negativity constraints iii loading leverage iv identifying and removing the outliers if any and v split half analysis validation for a suitable number of components fmax was used to represent maximum fluorescence intensity for an individual component and fmax was normalized for inter laboratory comparison using the raman integration method lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 6 epr spectra electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker x band 5000 germany was used to track oh by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent the magnetic field was modulated at 100 khz with a power supply of 2 2 mw the center field was 3480 00 g with a sweep width of 100 0 g 2 7 solid phase extraction the solid phase extraction spe cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 g 6 ml were used to extract dom from samples including the raw secondary effluent finished water and naoh based extracted adsorbed electrosorped dom on the rem surface while operating with and without electric potential the spe process is described elsewhere dittmar et al 2008 zhang et al 2021b briefly the cartridges were rinsed and activated with methanol 12 ml and 0 01 m hcl solution 12 ml 500 ml of each water sample was passed through the cartridge with a 5 ml min 1 flow speed the volume of samples was kept constant for pseudo quantitative comparison then the cartridges were rinsed with 18 ml of 0 01 m hcl to remove salts and gently dried the cartridges using n2 gas the dom retained in cartridges was eluted using 12 ml of methanol the volume of the methanol was reduced to 1 ml using an n2 concentrator and samples were stored at 20 c before ft icr ms measurements 2 8 ft icr ms analysis ft icr ms bruker solarix germany equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an electrospray ionization esi source operated in negative mode was used to analyze the dom composition the main operating parameters were continuous injection with a flow speed of 120 µl h 1 capillary inlet voltage was set to 3 8 kv the ion accumulation time was 0 06 s and the mass range was 100 1600 m z the instrument was calibrated using a 10 mm sodium formate solution all possible formulas were identified with bruker data analysis software and homemade software the molecular formula calculation was based on the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 1h1 120 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 31p0 2 35cl0 3 and the peaks with the signal to noise s n ratio 5 were employed for calculation if an m z value observed m z corresponds to multiple possible molecular formulas the homologous series approach analysis based on ch2 for above 500 da and the minimum number of hetero atoms rule n s p and cl were used to screen out the correct molecular formulas hao et al 2017 ruan et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 for a given chemical formula the difference between the calculated mass and the measured one was less than one ppm few indices dbe aimod and nosc were calculated as described in j zhang et al 2021 the dom components were categorized into five compound classes based on the following criteria 1 poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs aimod 0 66 2 polyphenols polyp 0 66 aimod 50 3 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds huph aimod 0 50 and h c 1 5 4 aliphatic compounds aliph 1 5 h c 2 and 5 carbohydrate compounds carbo h c 2 the ft icr ms spectra were also divided into three molecular size groups i e high mw 450 m z medium mw 300 450 m z and low mw 300 m z fractions 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance evaluation of rem using fluorescence spectroscopy before the performance evaluation of rem a blank milli q water was treated in the system organic traces with slight uv adsorption were detected the source of organic traces was the organic binder used during the synthesis of rem interestingly these traces have not shown any fluorescence peak therefore fluorescence spectroscopy was employed as a performance evaluation tool in this study however doc and tn removal kinetics are presented in supplementary fig s3 rem system efficiently removed doc and tn up to 96 and 70 respectively in a previous rem based treatment removal of tn was associated with the amount of cl ion available in the background with the reduction of total organic nitrogen ton above 85 lin et al 2021 a three component model was well fitted on the combined eems which provided tryptophan like c1 microbial humic like c2 and tyrosine like c3 components fig 1 maqbool et al 2017 yang et al 2015 although the inter component comparison is not associated with the relative concentration of contents in the secondary effluent the distribution of fluorescence components was calculated to c1 64 5 c2 17 5 and c3 18 0 the distribution of fluorescent components was typical and matching has been reported abundantly in the literature on secondary effluent treatment lyu et al 2021 ruscalleda et al 2014 the c1 and c3 represented the aromatic microbial products released as effluent organic matter efom in secondary effluent while c2 is generally associated with humic substances formed due to microbial humification in biological wastewater treatment systems coble 2007 cohen et al 2014 ly et al 2018 maqbool et al 2017 stedmon et al 2007 the kinetics of the fluorescence components during secondary effluent treatment in rem are presented in fig 2 and the comparison was drawn between the working conditions with vs without electrical potential of rem in electrically operated rem the highest removal was noted for c2 98 followed by c1 96 and c3 91 while comparing the results of fluorescence components removal in both conditions the higher removal of c2 could be ascribed to its higher adsorption on the rem surface the adsorption of fluorescence components on the rem surface working without electrical potential was recorded as 2 7 15 4 and 3 2 for c1 c2 and c3 respectively the relatively higher adsorption of c2 microbial humic like could be justified due to the enrichment of condensed aromatic structures in the humic like component and higher relatively negative charge on such dom fraction which promoted the electrostatic interaction hu et al 2021 truong et al 2021 the rem showed remarkable performance in removing dom from the secondary effluent with minimal adsorption and the role of electrical potential was significant compared to the impermeable electrode the ti4o7 rem has efficiently removed dom with mild current density conditions 2 10 ma cm2 ouarda et al 2020 the impact of the current density on the removal of dom was also investigated and presented in fig 2 b except for the c3 the insignificant difference in the removal of c1 and c2 was noted for operation at different current densities the c3 removal was increased from 70 at 2 ma cm2 to 91 at 10 ma cm2 overall slight improved finished water was obtained referring to the increase in direct electron transfer and generation of oh at increasing current densities ganzenko et al 2021 trellu et al 2018b the generation of oh in rem was confirmed through dmpo spin trapping epr spectra supplementary fig s4 the convection enhanced mass transport to the surface of rem has been reported as a critical factor to remove organics in rem based treatment zaky and chaplin 2014 as reported in previous studies the volumetric flux has shown a direct relationship between the flux and removal of organics ganzenko et al 2021 lin et al 2021 however no significant difference was noted in this study between the removal of fluorescence components and the flux as shown in fig 2 c the removal of c1 c2 and c3 were recorded to be 94 1 vs 93 9 99 3 vs 99 4 and 94 6 vs 94 4 at membrane flux of 1000 vs 2000 lmh respectively the commercial rem used in this study showed robust performance in removing dom without the influence of flux the stability of rem was tested in a 10 cycles repetition experiment and consistent performance in removing fluorescence components was noted fig 2 d the highest removal remained constant for c1 99 and least for the c3 90 it shows the robust synthesis of rem at a commercial scale and the potential to use it for large scale applications during the repetition experiment the dom adsorbed on the rem surface were extracted using naoh ph 12 and the composition of the electosorped dom is also provided in fig 2 d although a significant difference was noted among the fmax of each fluorescence component it indicated that the degradation on the rem surface followed the preference of adsorption of different fluorescence components the treatability of different dom fractions i e hpi tpi and hpo was also tested in the rem system and the results are presented in fig 3 in all dom fractions the tryptophan like c1 component was present with the highest share and its enrichment was found in the order of hpi hpo tpi on the other hand c2 with reasonable fmax was only detected in hpo fraction followed by the slight tpi fraction and negligible hpi fraction the electro oxidation was found to be non selective and rem successfully degraded all dom fractions the higher removal of c1 could be ascribed to its extensive hydrophilic nature the comparison of the adsorbed fraction showed that c2 was found minimal in the treatment of dom fractions supplementary fig s5 it can be deduced from the results that c2 was highly adsorbed on the rem surface oxidation on the rem surface preferred humic like substances lin et al 2021 from comparing the dynamics of fluorescence dom and toc in rem systems it is inferred that fluorescence moieties are more sensitive to oxidation than the compounds without fluorescence previous studies have also reported a noticeable difference in the kinetics of with vs without fluorescence emitting dom during aops treatment ahn et al 2017 maqbool et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the eem parafac modeling results indicate that the ti4o7 rem can degrade the dom and provide a stable secondary effluent above this general depiction of dom removal in rem it was considered of immense importance to study the detailed changes at the molecular level in dom and determine the role of leading phenomena in removing different components and their transformation 3 2 characterization of dom using ft icr ms the assigned formulas in secondary effluent were mostly found in 200 to 700 m z fig 4 the compounds with higher intensities were located within the mw of 250 to 400 m z and this region contained 39 of the total compounds the mw range 250 to 400 m z with significant intensities was consistent among the raw secondary effluent and finished water from the rem systems working with or without electrical potential similar molecular size distribution in secondary effluent was also reported previously gonsior et al 2011 wang et al 2018b compared to the influent a minute reduction in relative intensities was detected in the finished water from rem working without electrical potential in line with fluorescence spectroscopy results fig 2 the electrically operated rem remarkably diminished the relative intensity and chemical diversity of dom representing the substantial oxidation potential of the rem system compounds with m z 550 were almost disappeared transformation of scarce high mw compounds could be a reason for their extinction rem more or less proportionately degraded the compounds throughout the esi spectra regardless of m z the compounds adsorbed electrosorped on the rem surface were noticeably lower than secondary effluent representing fewer adsorption electrosoprtion during the treatment supplementary fig s6 rem without electrical potential adsorbed the compounds with a relatively higher intensity in secondary effluent however several new peaks emerged in electrosorped dom fraction such emergence of new compounds could be ascribed to the transformation products formed from oxidation on the rem surface ft icr ms spectra presented a minor role of adsorption in removing dom from secondary effluent ft icr ms also helped determine the potential of rem toward oxidation or adsorption electrosorption of dom which was systematically elucidated in the following discussion 3 3 compositional changes in dom the composition of dom was noticeably different in the finished water than raw secondary effluent the dominant classes i e huph and aliph compounds remained abundant in the finished water and naoh based extracted adsorbed fractions from the rem surface in both working conditions with vs without electrical potential table 1 previous studies on the oxidation of secondary effluent also reported huph and aliph as dominant classes before and after treatment zhang et al 2021b 2021a compared to raw secondary effluent finished water from the electrically operated rem system showed a decline up to 7 in the share of huph and a concurrent increase in aliph 3 after the oxidation the rise in aliph was also reported previously zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 the mnox based oxidation of suwanee river fulvic acid srfa also showed an inverse relationship between these two chemical classes huph and aliph zhang et al 2021 the compositional changes in electrosorped dom fraction were significantly different from respective finished water and raw secondary effluent the contribution of huph vs aliph was 44 89 vs 52 35 and 67 19 vs 31 16 in elecrosorped fraction and raw secondary effluent respectively it infers that the electrically assisted adsorption electrosorption caused selective uptake of dom or transformed them on the rem surface through direct electron transfer and or radical attack wang et al 2020 the evidence of extensive transformation degradation of dom on the rem surface was also recorded in eem parafac components ft icr ms also presented the generation of several new compounds fig 5 while operating the rem without electrical potential minimal changes were recorded between the dom adsorbed on the rem surface and in finished water fig 5 a the comparison of adsorbed and electrosorped dom fractions deduced that electrical potential caused extensive direct electron transfer and or radical attack to dom on the rem surface zaky and chaplin 2014 the van krevelen diagrams presented the degradation of the compounds with high o c by rem with electrical potential fig 5 the degradation of the high o c has also been reported previously zhang et al 2021 chemicals with high o c usually are more reactive than un functionalized aliphatic which is one of the reasons for their removal by the rem system zhang et al 2021 the average o c in raw secondary effluent elecrosorped dom and finished water was recorded as 0 45 0 46 and 0 41 respectively the lower value of o c could be ascribed to the release of co2 by mineralization causing the relative depletion of oxygen in finished water however the average dbe was decreased from 7 30 to 5 74 in dom fraction from the rem surface since dbe includes all double bound carbon moieties c c and c o the decrease in dbe was caused by the cleavage of c c or aliphatic rings instead of c o of dom this means that the degree of unsaturation of dom on the rem surface was decreased lv et al 2017 the decrease in the nosc from 0 38 to 0 46 electrosorped and 0 52 finished water was also noticed the oh addition and cleavage of the c c were seemed to be dominant oxidation modes in degradation and mineralization of the high mw water phase unlike the finished water the dom electrosorped showed substantial reduction 48 in aimod representing severe oxidation on the rem surface through direct electron transfer and or radical attack zaky and chaplin 2013 noticeable changes in average mw of dom were recorded among the raw secondary effluent and other dom fractions from the rem systems table 1 the raw secondary effluent was mainly composed of the high and medium mw 90 high mw 43 and medium mw 51 which changed to 24 and 62 for high mw and medium mw respectively in finished water from the rem system operated under electrical potential reduction in mw was also noted in the electrosorped fraction of dom with average changes from 445 to 394 m z the reduction in the high mw of dom indicated the transformation of the larger molecules to medium electrosoped 57 6 and finished water 62 2 and low mw fractions electrosorped 13 4 and finished wate 14 5 of dom selectivity of rem with vs without electric potential toward the compounds with specific elemental composition was noticeable in both adsorbed electrosorped and finished water table 1 and supplementary fig s7 dom in electrosorped fraction was dominated with the cho compounds which increased from 32 in raw secondary effluent to 56 the cho composition potentially represents the lignin aromatic polymer and lipids in the effluent zhang et al 2021 while the compounds containing nitrogen i e chon were found 8 in electrosorped fraction and negligible in adsorbed fraction which represented the uptake of nitrogen containing chemicals through electrostatic adsorption however chos showed the opposite trend to chon and a higher share was noted in adsorbed fraction 67 than that electrosorped 30 the extraordinary difference for chos between adsorbed and electrosorped fractions could be ascribed to the easy oxidation of sulfur containing moieties the decrease in cumulative peak intensities of chos on the rem surface and in the finished water was 92 and 82 respectively these results inferred that applying electrical potential brought about substantial changes in the adsorption phenomena of the rem system by involving electrostatic interaction and direct electron transfer and or radical attack in short the cho followed the adsorption route to attach to the surface however electrostatic potential enhanced the uptake of chon and transformed the chos on the rem surface the dominant chemical classes were different in the finished water compared to those on the rem surface the cho compounds were increased from 32 to 45 and the chos compounds were extraordinarily decreased from 56 to 20 while organo chlorinated compounds cl dom were increased from 3 to 31 in the finished water it is important to mention that the raw secondary effluent contained 70 mg l of cl which could be potentially transformed to chlorate perchlorate it also generated activated chlorine species which assisted the formation of cl dom in the rem system the evidence of the generation of organo chlorinated compounds in rem systems was also provided in previous studies ganzenko et al 2021 wang et al 2020 this study found that cl dom compounds are hydrophilic and constituted the main share of finished water and the lightly electrosorped on the rem surface 3 4 the role of phosphorus containing dom p dom was minimal in the rem system 3 4 precursor and resistant compounds a large number of compounds 74 in raw secondary effluent acted as precursors for electro oxidation table 2 and fig 6 the system showed that less than 27 of compounds of secondary effluent were resistive toward complete degradation however a substantial reduction in such compounds was also recorded table 2 it is important to mention that the dom precursors represent the compounds that fully degraded after the oxidation reaction another study showed around 10 50 of compounds in raw secondary effluent as precursors during the oxidation process zhang et al 2021b the distribution of precursors in terms of chemical structures showed huph as the main class of compounds to be oxidized transformed or mineralized on the rem surface 70 as well as in the water phase 69 table 2 and fig 6 the aliph 27 28 as precursors followed the share of huph however pahs and polyph were also fully consumed the preference of the different classes as precursors also followed the relative abundance in the raw secondary effluent in the group of resistant molecular compounds enrichment of aliph compounds showed a relatively higher tendency toward degradation than huph compounds which was also reported previously zhang et al 2021 the cleavage of the c c and aliphatic rings with electron donating capacity seems to be the priority oxidation mode of the huph which was also depicted from the change of dbe fig 7 the majority of the carbohydrate was also equally oxidized on the rem surface and in the water phase likewise the distribution of mw in influent the precursors on the rem surface and in the water phase were also composed of the high to medium mw fraction with relatively equal shares table 2 and fig 7 previous research admitted and proved that the oxidation process transformed the large mw fractions to medium or small sized ones chen et al 2020 lv et al 2017 in electro oxidation process high mw compounds were found less resistive than the medium mw and low mw the abundant chos based compounds in raw secondary effluent acted as the leading precursors 60 63 during the oxidation on the rem surface and in the water phase table 2 however the other major contributor in influent i e cho showed the least share 17 in the group of precursors than the actual amount therefore the resistant group compounds were enriched in cho 44 followed by chos 50 53 the recent literature on the oxidation of dom and characterization through ft icr ms also justified the result which presented the sulfur containing moieties as most vulnerable to be oxidized followed by nitrogen containing moieties zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 a matching distribution of precursors different compositional classes was observed between the dom extracted from the rem surface and present in finished water 3 5 dom products the dom produced by the rem system differed significantly from the precursors available in raw secondary effluent table 2 figs 6 and 7 the extraordinary difference in the composition was recorded on the rem surface the oxidation on the rem surface showed less presence of the huph 14 while abundant aliph 79 compared to the enriched huph 70 and moderate aliph 27 in the precursors such inverse changes showed the transformation of the huph to aliph compounds on the rem surface being the class of the dominant compound in raw secondary effluent huph was also found abundant as the resistant finished water showed relatively less significant changes between the composition of dom in precursors and products although the number of precursor compounds was three times higher than the products up to 9 declination in huph share was recorded between the precursors from the secondary effluent and the finished water containing new compounds it deduced that the produced aliph were mostly hydrophobic compounds and found adsorbed on the rem surface and less in the finished water interestingly the same amount of compounds was found as precursors and the resistants in the water phase and on the rem surface which indicated the vulnerability of the similar molecules to direct electron transfer or radical based oxidation on the other hand electrosorped fraction was found less than 50 of the dom formed in finished water mineralization and desorption from the rem surface could be the probable reasons unlike the oxidation on the rem surface slight generation of pahs and polyph was noted in finished water table 2 and fig 6 on the contrary to the oxidation on the rem surface products in finished water were enriched with medium sized 60 mw followed by the low mw 12 indicating the transformation of large size molecules and which could also be linked to the insufficient oxidation of the huph fig 7 it inferred that rem trapped the large sized compounds caused their extensive oxidation and changed them to medium and low mw fractions among the different classes chos showed higher electron donating capacity of which the contribution was decreased from 60 precursors to 6 products on the rem surface and 63 precursors to 1 products in permeate the minimal generation of chos products on rem surface and finished water inferred that desulfonation was not the leading mechanism but some other oxidative desulfonation reactions would happen zhang et al 2021a the behavior of chon was interesting which was visually transformed with few resistant 1 but substantial was formed in products 34 in the dom fraction extracted from the rem surface while in the water phase the chon compounds were extensively transformed to the other classes of dom with possibilities to cho and cl dom the emergence of the extraordinary share of cl dom 81 highlighted the role of chlorides in the secondary effluent ganzenko et al 2021 wang et al 2020 3 6 limitations of ft icr ms and challenges of rem ft icr ms was found effective in providing the comprehensive details of dom in secondary effluent however the potential limitations of ft icr ms in our study would include i extraction efficiency of spe toward different dom components ii potential changes in dom structure by acidifying to ph 2 3 and slight generation of chlorinated compounds iii competitiveness of esi which is independent of analyte concentration and suppression of less efficiently ionizable compounds chen et al 2021 dittmar et al 2008 he and hur 2015 lavonen et al 2013 the reproducibility of esi for the high resolution mass spectrometry of dom in aquatic systems is also challenging hawkes et al 2020 although rem effectively degraded the dom in secondary effluent and most components disappeared after the rem treatment cl dom were produced in abundance previous studies on rem based water treatment have also shown the generation of active chlorine species due to cl in the water matrix which played a role in the degradation of organic contents ganzenko et al 2021 wang et al 2020 according to the findings of this study there is a need for a further detailed toxicological assessment of such cl dom in treated secondary effluent which warrants the rem applications on the real scale level the safety of the treated water can be evaluated through chronic toxicity and cytotoxicity tests on zebrafish and human cells 4 conclusion this study systematically determined the treatability of dom in rem systems based on fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms the fate of dom available in secondary effluent with its different components and fractions was comprehensively elucidated at the molecular level the following conclusions are drawn i all fluorescence components c1 c3 in secondary effluent showed above 90 removal in rem systems within 30 min of operation however the kinetics of the tyrosine like fluorescence was relatively slower and microbial humic like component was noticeably adsorbed on the rem surface ii the esi spectra presented 250 to 400 m z as the dominant region for the dom in secondary effluent electro oxidation degraded the large sized molecules 550 m z and new small and medium sized compounds emerged on the rem surface and in finished water iii two dominant classes i e unsaturated and phenolic huph and aliphatic compounds made above 90 of the dom in secondary effluent the decrease in the former class caused a proportional increase in the latter which was found severe on the rem surface and marginal in the water phase iv about half of the compounds were found with the composition of chos which were substantially diminished after electro oxidation leading to mineralization or transformation to other classes a similar number of molecular compounds were acted as precursors however their propensity to be degraded or mineralized was significantly different on the rem surface and in the water phase v the new dom generated after electro oxidation was 14 and 31 of the precursors at the rem surface and in the water phase respectively which showed higher mineralization of the compound diminished from the raw secondary effluent the chloride ion in secondary effluent played a magnificent role in oxidation and finished water enriched with organo chlorinated 31 was obtained our findings facilitate the understanding of the oxidation of dom in different water matrices in eaops this study could be a way forward to estimate better the possible products released in finished water so their interaction in the environment and an association to the health could be evaluated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16346,antibiotic contamination has become the primary environmental concern due to its potential to induce the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args to obtain the efficient antibiotic removal approach the combination of photocatalysis and microalgae technology for the efficient removal and reducing environmental risk of three typical antibiotics norfloxacin oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole was demonstrated in this study the g c3n4 material with advantages of low cost simple synthesizing nontoxic and wider spectral absorption was selected and synthesized by an easy thermal polymerization process of urea characterization results showed that the prepared material exhibited a typical structure of g c3n4 and irregular nanosheet structure with the large bet surface area and mesoporous structure the irradiation wavelength and solution ph showed great influences on the photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin over g c3n4 nanosheets o2 h and oh generated by the photocatalysis of g c3n4 nanosheets were confirmed based on energy band results and electron spin resonance detection while o2 was the main contributor to the antibiotics degradation in accordance with scavenging experiments many nor photocatalytic products were identified and degradation pathway was proposed due to the formation of many unmineralized products the acute toxicity of nor photocatalytic reaction solution was increased and then the introduction of microalgae promoted the degradation of some photocatalytic degradation products of nor but only chlorella pyrenoidosa treatment resulted in the decrease of toxicity of nor reaction solution this study provides useful information on the application of the combination of photocatalysis and microalgae technology for removal of antibiotics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalysis microalgae technology antibiotics norfloxacin mechanism detoxification 1 introduction as very effective medicines for microbial infections antibiotics have been extensively used and have a lot benefits to human and livestock health over the past decades yun et al 2021 since only partially absorption by organisms and incomplete degradation by sewage treatment facilities antibiotics are continuously released and accumulated in the natural water environment kümmerer 2009 at present antibiotics have been detected in various water environments such as rivers lakes groundwater seawater and even drinking water rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 huang et al 2020 for instance feng et al 2020 reported that the average concentrations of eight antibiotics were 46 4 ng l and 88 45 ng l in five urban and four township drinking water sources in chongqing area of the yangtze river in addition antibiotics possess high biological toxicity to aquatic organisms even at low concentrations however more seriously they can induce the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args that would impair the curative abilities of antibiotics causing serious threat to human health and ecological risks zainab et al 2020 many kinds of antibiotics including fluoroquinolones sulfonamides tetracyclines macrolides and β lactams were used for related disease prevention and treatment and detected in multiple environmental media as several important antibiotics fluoroquinolones sulfonamides and tetracyclines have been widely used all over the world in particular usages of these antibiotics account for 17 5 and 7 of total antibiotics in china for 2013 zhang et al 2015 norfloxacin nor a fluoroquinolone antibiotic with the largest use is the top 5 antibiotics used in china and has been detected in the level of ng l to μg l in various water environments zhang et al 2015 chen and wang 2020 meanwhile oxytetracycline otc and sulfamethoxazole smx belonging to tetracyclines and sulfonamides have been extensively produced and consumed and the concentration of otc and smx can reach 82 59 1 90 μg l and 63 6 μg l in the wastewater from animal farms zhi et al 2018 wei et al 2011 besides these antibiotics even at trace levels could induce the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args and cause teratogenicity and genotoxicity posing threat to organisms and ecosystem safety bilal et al 2020 consequently it is urgent to develop the effective technology for the removal of antibiotics from aqueous environment the application of photocatalytic technology to curb organic pollutants in water environment has been recognized as a most promising method fan et al 2021 li et al 2021a since the discovery of photocatalytic decompose water by titanium dioxide tio2 the synthesis modification and application of tio2 has gained huge attention in the past few decades fujishima and honda 1972 tio2 has exhibited the high capacity for the photocatalytic degradation of fluoroquinolone antibiotics however owing to its wide band gap 3 2 ev for the anatase phase tio2 can only activated by the uv irradiation λ 380 nm chen et al 2017 thus great efforts have been paid to develop novel photocatalysts with better visible light response and encouragingly many other semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed and their photocatalytic performances were verified via characterization technologies and photocatalytic experiments zhu et al 2019 2021a among these photocatalytic materials the graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has garnered intensive attention because of its low cost simple synthesizing nontoxic and wider spectral absorption ong et al 2016 li et al 2021b g c3n4 has been utilized to cut down various environmental contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps wu et al 2020a nevertheless due to the low mineralization efficiency or taking longer irradiation time to achieve high mineralization of photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics there are generally many photocatalytic intermediates in the reaction system li et al 2021c which may lead to the increase of the toxicity of the photocatalytic reaction solution bechambi et al 2016 this may partially limit the application potential of g c3n4 to remove antibiotic contamination the activated sludge process has been one of the most widely used sewage treatment technologies because of its low cost mature technology convenient operation and large wastewater treatment capacity liu 2003 however although antibiotics can be transformed and degraded by activated sludge the conventional activated sludge process cannot completely remove antibiotics from sewage göbel et al 2005 in fact genes that encode for enzymes that biotransformed antibiotics are a type of antibiotic resistance gene because those biotransformations protect the cell from the antibiotic so antibiotic resistant bacteria and args would be induced and spread in the long term in the conventional sewage treatment system and pose serious impacts on ecological environment and human health li and zhang 2010 it is considered that conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been the main reservoir for args li and zhang 2011 consequently another biological treatment process microalgae based technology has gradually attracted the attention of scientists which possesses many advantages such as solar driven low cost environment friendliness carbon fixation and resource utilization potential xiong et al 2018 antibiotics can be effectively removed by microalgae based technology from antibiotics containing wastewater but its removal efficiency is highly dependent on the species of algae leng et al 2020 for example chlorella showed a high removal activity for many antibiotics e g cefradine cefalexin amoxicillin cefixime and ceftazidime while the performance of other algae species is unsatisfactory for the antibiotic removal such as microcystis aeruginosa chlamydomonas mexicana and nannochloris sp leng et al 2020 the removal mechanisms mainly involve adsorption bio transformation and degradation accumulation and hydrolysis of antibiotics moreover the removal of antibiotics by microalgae based technology generally is time consuming therefore an innovative concept that is integrating microalgae based technology with other treatment processes e g advanced oxidation processes is feasible for the enhancement of antibiotics removal xiong et al 2018 it is reported that photodegradation products of antibiotics are vulnerable to degrade into nontoxic entities by microalgae biodegradation which could reduce the cost and ecological risks liu et al 2017 recently chen et al 2020 reported that the prepared monoclinic bivo4 combining with microalgae dictyosphaerium sp exhibited an efficient removal for sulfamethazine under visible light irradiation but authors declared that the degradation by products of sulfamethazine and detoxification in the reaction processes still needed further investigation however there are only few studies on the integration of microalgae based antibiotic removal with photocatalysis technology hence in consideration of low cost simple synthesizing nontoxic and wider spectral absorption the g c3n4 photocatalyst was selected in combination with two kinds of microalgae scenedesmus obliquus s obliquus and chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa to investigate the removal process of three typical antibiotics nor otc and smx firstly the g c3n4 photocatalyst were synthesized via urea thermal polymerization process and characterized using various analysis technologies secondly the photocatalytic degradation kinetics and mechanism of nor otc and smx by g c3n4 photocatalyst were systematically investigated and the reaction pathway of nor was proposed based on products analysis and theoretical calculation thirdly two microalgae were introduced to treat the photocatalytic reaction solution of nor and the toxicity of the photocatalytic reaction and the microalgae treatment solution of nor was also evaluated the studied joint technology can be used in the advanced treatment process of traditional sewage treatment plants to improve the effluent quality or specially used for purification and treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the detailed information of chemicals and reagents was described in supporting materials text s1 2 2 preparation and characterization of g c3n4 nanosheets the g c3n4 nanosheets were synthesized via urea thermal polymerization process in n2 atmosphere a ceramic crucible containing 10 0 g urea was placed in a tubular furnace slg1100 100 shanghai litres of the testing instrument co ltd china then the temperature was raised to 550 c at the rate of 5 c min and kept for 4 h in n2 atmosphere after cooling the prepared material underwent grinding washing anhydrous ethanol centrifuging and drying to obtain g c3n4 nanosheets the obtained nanosheets were placed in a dark and dry place for further characterization and photocatalytic experiments all of characterization technologies were described in supporting materials text s1 2 3 batch photocatalytic typical antibiotics degradation experiments the photocatalytic experiments of three typical antibiotics nor otc and smx were carried out in an xpa 7g5 photoreactor equipped with a 350 w xenon lamp as the simulated solar irradiation nanjing xu jiang electromechanical factory china 50 0 ml of 10 0 mg l antibiotics aqueous solution prepared in ultra pure water was placed in each quartz tube which contained 10 0 mg of g c3n4 nanosheets 0 2 g l of catalyst concentration the prepared samples containing antibiotics and g c3n4 nanosheets were sonicated for 5 min to achieve a better dispersion of the catalyst in the reaction solution for achieving adsorption equilibrium of antibiotics the reaction solution sample was stirred for 60 min on a magnetic stirrer in dark condition then the xe lamp was set off and 2 0 ml of reaction suspension was sucked out by a pipette and put into a centrifuge tube at each set time interval subsequently the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 13 000 rpm and the obtained supernatant also needed filtering through 0 22 µm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane the residual antibiotics concentration in the filtrate was determined by an agilent 1260 infinity high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector hplc dad united states moreover the 10 ml of nor sample was taken out for toc analysis at each set time interval and only one sample 10 ml was taken at one quartz tube and the other time point was sampling at another quartz tube the effect of irradiation wavelength on photocatalytic reaction was realized by adding filter λ 400 nm or without filter λ 290 nm the effect of ph on photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 nanosheets was investigated via adjusting the initial solution ph to 3 5 7 9 and 11 using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide and the effect of dissolved organic matter dom on the photocatalytic reaction over g c3n4 nanosheets was examined by adding different concentrations gradients of humic acid 0 1 and 10 mg l the photocatalytic performance of the prepared photocatalyst for removal of low concentration antibiotics was also evaluated by setting the initial concentration of nor solution at 20 μg l the treatment group without g c3n4 nanosheets and the control group without irradiation were also carried out at the same time all experiments were carried out in triplicate and at 20 c 2 4 degradation of nor and its photocatalytic products by microalgae two kinds of widespread freshwater microalgae s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa were selected to study their performance to degrade nor and its photocatalytic degradation products the source and cultural methods of microalgae are shown in supporting materials text s2 the exponential growth phase and healthy microalgae was used in further alga growth inhibition tests and nor degradation experiments the cultivation of microalgae and degradation experiments of nor reaction solutions by microalgae were carried out in a gxz 500b led constant temperature light incubator ningbo jiangnan co ltd china 10 ml of s obliquus or c pyrenoidosa was inoculated into the bg11 media with 90 ml of nor reaction solutions 10 0 mg l of initial concentration of different photocatalytic reaction time that included two types of nor rection samples irradiated in simulated sunlight λ 290 nm for 40 min and initial nor solution without irradiation the reactor is a 250 ml transparent conical flask control group with nor rection samples but no microalgae inoculated was also implemented to monitor possible changes of nor and its photocatalytic products in the same cultural condition blank group with microalgae and no nor and its products was conducted to observe the growth of microalgae in order to ensure the growth rate of microalgae the inoculation concentration of each microalga was the same 10 of the inoculation volume and not less than 106 ml and each microalgae density was measured at 0 1 2 4 7 and 11 d to investigate the growth of microalgae the determination method of microalgae density was used the linear equation between algal cell density number of algal cells was counted using a hemacytometer and the absorbance at 680 nm and the detailed method was described in text s3 2 0 ml of microalgae treated reaction solutions were sampled at 0 d and 11 d and centrifuged at 8000 rpm then supernatants were filtered through 0 22 μm ptfe membrane to collect filtrate for analyzing changes of nor and its photocatalytic products and possible new degradation products by microalgae degradation 2 5 toxicity tests of nor photocatalysis and microalgae degradation solution the acute toxicity of nor reaction solution by photocatalysis and microalgae degradation was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of a luminescent bacterium photobacterium phosphoreum t3 spp the lyophilized luminescent bacteria powder was purchased from shenzhen labsun scientific instrument co ltd china and toxicity test method of luminescent bacteria referred to the previous study li et al 2018 the lyophilized powder of p phosphoreum was first activated using a small volume of cold 2 nacl solution and then enough volume of 3 nacl solution was added to prepared luminescent bacteria working solution for the photocatalytic process before used for toxicity test nor reaction solutions 10 0 mg l of initial concentration with different reaction time were centrifuged and filtered to remove g c3n4 nanosheets in addition microalgae should also be removed from nor reaction solution in the toxicity evaluation of microalgae degradation of nor and its products 500 μl of nor reaction solutions 9 0 mg l with 10 v v nacl solution and 500 µl of p phosphoreum working solution were mixed and oscillated for 15 min then the bioluminescence intensity of each group was measured using a portable luminescent bacterial toxicity detector lumifox 2000 shenzhen labsun scientific instrument co ltd china the control treatment was the mixture of 500 µl of p phosphoreum working solution and 500 µl of 3 nacl solution the luminous inhibition was calculated according to the formula i 1 t t c 0 t 0 c t 100 where i is the luminous inhibition rate of the test solution t0 and tt are the luminous intensity value at time 0 and t of containing nor reaction solutions treatment group c0 and ct are the luminous intensity value at time 0 and t of the control group 2 6 analysis an agilent 1260 infinity hplc usa was used for the determination of residual concentration of antibiotics in photocatalytic reaction but the low concentration sample of nor 20 μg l was analyzed using a thermo scientific ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatography instrument uhplc coupled with an ab sciex qtrap 4500 lc ms system photocatalysis and microalgae degradation products of nor were measured utilizing an agilent 1290 infinity ii uhplc coupled with a bruker maxis q tof ms system equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 µm the variation of total organic carbon toc in photocatalytic process was also analyzed the detailed information of the above analysis methods was shown in the supporting materials text s4 2 7 identification of active species an jeol jes fa200 electron spin resonance esr spectrometer japan was employed to detect potential free radicals in g c3n4 nanosheets photocatalytic reaction and the detailed determination method was shown in the supporting materials text s5 in addition free radicals scavenging experiments were performed utilizing isopropanol ipa l ascorbic acid l aa and ammonium oxalate ao as free radical scavengers to investigate roles of oh o2 and h on the photocatalytic degradation of three typical antibiotics 2 8 theoretical calculation molecular orbital calculation was implemented at the b3lyp 6 311g level to optimize the structural geometry of nor using the gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 li et al 2019a the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo was obtained from gaussian output file and the value of 2 e h o m o 2 was calculated to predict the most reactive part for electron extraction from nor molecular 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of g c3n4 nanosheets the micromorphology of g c3n4 nanosheets was observed by scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem technologies fig 1 a and b as shown in sem image the prepared g c3n4 material was consisted of a great quantity of curly thin sheets which led to the fluffy structure formation and enhanced the interaction between photocatalyst and pollutants and the wrinkle like sheet structure of g c3n4 was also observed in tem image according to the x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig 1c two major diffraction peaks 13 2 and 27 6 were marked out and assigned to the 100 and 002 crystal planes of g c3n4 nanosheets which were attributed to the repeat of tri s triazine units and the interlayer π π stacking yan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 from the result of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 1d the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets with a bet surface area of 39 38 m2 g showed a representative type iv adsorption isotherm with h3 type hysteresis loop at a relative pressure spanning 0 45 1 0 p p0 which suggested the mesoporous structure li et al 2021d meanwhile the bjh pore size distribution curve of g c3n4 nanosheets exhibited a strong peak at 3 7 nm and a weaker peak at 31 1 nm belonging to mesoporous which further confirmed the mesoporous structure of g c3n4 nanosheets additionally in order to further characterize the types of chemical bonds ft ir analysis was used to identify bonding details of g c3n4 nanosheets fig 1e a sharp peak at 805 cm 1 was contributed by the bending vibration of tri s triazine units and a cluster of strong absorption peaks at 1000 1700 cm 1 should be assigned to the c n stretching vibrations in the cn heterocycles while the broad absorption peaks at 3000 3400 cm 1 related to the stretch vibration of uncondensed amino groups and adsorbed water molecules of g c3n4 sample surface li et al 2015 the light absorption characteristic and electronic band structure of g c3n4 nanosheets were examined and calculated based on uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra fig 1f the fundamental absorption edge of prepared g c3n4 nanosheets was 516 nm that corresponded to 2 6 ev of bandgap e g calculated based on kubelka munk equation compared with previous studies in this work the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets exhibit an increased visible light absorption and a narrower bandgap indicating the improvement of visible light utilization and photocatalytic performance of the synthetic material li et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 which may be mainly due to nanosheet the mesoporous structure meanwhile according to empirical equations text s6 chen et al 2014 the valence band maximum vbm and conduction band minimum cbm of g c3n4 nanosheets were derived as 1 53 ev and 1 07 ev respectively 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of typical antibiotics firstly the effect of irradiation wavelength on photocatalytic degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets was evaluated via the utilization of filter λ 400 nm to simulate visible light irradiation fig 2 a pseudo first order kinetic constants k obs of nor photocatalytic degradation with or without g c3n4 nanosheets at different wavelengths are shown in fig 2b and detailed degradation and fitting curves are listed in supporting materials fig s1 obviously the k obs of nor was raised from 0 0168 min 1 to 0 1015 min 1 0 to 0 0048 min 1 under simulated sunlight λ 290 nm and visible light irradiation respectively suggesting the excellent photocatalytic performance of the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets however the irradiation wavelength has a great influence on the performance of g c3n4 nanosheets such as the k obs of simulated sunlight irradiation is 21 times higher than that of visible light irradiation and this might be explained that much more active species were generated under the simulated sunlight irradiation than visible light irradiation discussion in section 3 3 moreover in order to examine the photocatalytic performance of prepared g c3n4 nanosheets on other antibiotics otc and smx were selected to carry out the photocatalytic experiment under simulated sunlight irradiation as shown in fig 2c otc and smx degraded rapidly in the studied photocatalytic system and the order of k obs of three antibiotics was otc 0 1228 min 1 nor 0 1015 min 1 smx 0 0544 min 1 therefore the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets exhibited excellent applicability on the photocatalytic degradation of various antibiotics as a key factor on photocatalytic reaction the solution ph would possess direct influences on the surface charge of photocatalyst forms of ionizable compounds and species and quantity of active species in the photocatalytic systems the photocatalytic degradation rates of nor at various ph values 3 5 7 9 and 11 were examined under simulated sunlight and visible light irradiation which were illustrated in figs 3 a and s2 a significant effect of ph on the photocatalytic degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets was found under simulated sunlight irradiation and both strong acid ph 3 5 and alkali ph 11 environment are not favorable for nor degradation while the maximum nor degradation rate k obs 0 0966 min 1 was observed at ph 9 primarily at strong acid ph 3 or alkali ph 11 conditions the zeta potentials of g c3n4 nanosheets are more positive or negative fig 3b respectively meanwhile nor is ionized into positive or negative ionic forms fig 3c thus the repulsion between the catalyst and nor species might reduce the adsorption capacity of g c3n4 nanosheets resulting in the decrease of nor degradation efficiency in addition according to the analysis of photocatalytic mechanism in section 3 3 the consumption reduction of o2 proved to be the main active species for nor degradation and the production and consumption of o2 are shown in eqs 1 4 thus the consumption reduction of o2 proved to be the main active species for nor degradation could be considered as the reason to explain the increased degradation rate of nor from ph 5 to 9 in order to investigate the photocatalytic performance of the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets in the presence of dissolved organic matter dom a representative dom humic acid ha was examined using three concentration gradients 0 1 and 10 mg l generally high concentration of humic acid ha would inhibit the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst mainly due to the light shielding and absorption or quenching on reactive oxygen species ros li et al 2021a surprisingly no inhibition but a little promotion p 0 05 for the photocatalytic degradation of nor by g c3n4 in two studied concentrations of ha was observed figs 4 a and s3 previous studies have reported that dom can be excited under irradiation to generate a variety of active species e g excited dom oh and 1o2 to enhance the degradation of organic pollutants zhang et al 2019 therefore it is reasonable to speculate that formation of active species in the presence of ha should be responsible for the increased nor degradation efficiency via the photocatalysis of g c3n4 nanosheets in addition in order to verify the photocatalytic degradation of nor in realistic environmental conditions by the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets a relatively low initial concentration of nor 20 μg l was selected to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets as shown in fig 4b nor with an initial concentration of 20 μg l has been completely removed after 5 min of irradiation while the treatment with an initial concentration of 10 mg l nor must take 40 min to achieve the same removal effect meanwhile the adsorption of low concentration of nor 20 μg l by the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets is more favorable than that of high concentration of nor 10 mg l therefore the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets can effectively catalyze the photodegradation of nor even under complex environmental conditions e g high concentration of dom and low concentration pollutants furthermore the stability and reusability of the synthesized g c3n4 nanosheets was evaluated via three successive cycles of nor photocatalytic degradation experiments as shown in fig 4c the removal of nor did not show a significant decline and still reach 98 6 in the third cycle thus the synthesized g c3n4 nanosheets show good stability and reusability 3 3 photocatalytic mechanism to understand the photocatalytic mechanism of g c3n4 nanosheets the esr technology was used and adduct signals of spin trapping agent with free radicals under sunlight irradiation were shown in fig 5 a c specifically signals of dmpo o2 and dmpo oh adducts were identified and their intensities both increased with the increase of irradiation time the notably decreasing tempo signal with increasing of irradiation time was observed fig 5c which is because the formation of holes over g c3n4 nanosheets could scavenge tempo radicals resulting in the esr signal reduction of tempo so this experimental result not only proved the generation of photogenerated holes h but also indirectly demonstrated the existence of photogenerated electrons e in the presence of g c3n4 nanosheets wang et al 2020 as a contrast esr signals of the g c3n4 nanosheets under visible light irradiation were also investigated using same spin trapping methods fig s4 weaker esr signals of dmpo o2 adduct were observed with the increasing visible light irradiation time while almost no esr signal of dmpo oh adduct was observed within the investigated time frame meanwhile the esr signal of tempo did not decrease significantly hence these results demonstrated that the insufficient capacity to generate enough active species under visible light irradiation should be responsible for the low photocatalytic degradation efficiency of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets in order to further investigate the role of active species in nor degradation several scavengers were used to scavenge related active species in the g c3n4 nanosheets photocatalytic reaction as a specific oh quencher k ipa oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 ipa was usually used to scavenge oh in photocatalytic reaction jones et al 2009 meanwhile ao and l aa were employed as scavenges of photogenerated h and o2 k l aa o2 2 7 105 m 1 s 1 respectively zhao et al 2020 nishikimi 1975 as shown in figs 5d and s5 with the introduction of three scavengers the decline of photodegradation rate constant of nor was observed and l aa showed the greatest inhibitory effect of nor degradation indicating o2 was the main active species involving the photocatalytic degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets additionally ipa and ao also showed inhibition on nor degradation while ao s inhibition was greater which suggested both oh and h contributed to the degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets hence it is demonstrated that o2 h and oh are all participated in the photocatalytic degradation of nor by g c3n4 nanosheets while o2 is the primary contributor to the degradation of nor meanwhile in order to verify the generalizability of the proposed photocatalytic mechanism of g c3n4 nanosheets quenching experiments of two other antibiotics otc and smx were also implemented using same scavengers in the g c3n4 nanosheets photocatalytic reaction fitted reaction rate constants of otc and smx were illustrated in fig 5e and f and detailed degradation and fitting curves were listed in supporting materials fig s6 the scavenger of l aa also showed the greatest inhibitory effect of otc and smx photodegradation indicating o2 was also the main active species involving in the photocatalytic degradation of these two compounds over g c3n4 nanosheets scavengers of ipa and ao also reduced the photodegradation rate of otc and smx but the inhibitory effect of these two scavengers was weaker than that of l aa which suggest that oh and h also had contributions to the photodegradation of otc and smx however o2 was the main active species for the removal of the selected antibiotics in this study furthermore based on potential values of vb 1 53 ev and cb 1 07 ev and results of esr and quenching experiments speculated photocatalytic mechanisms were proposed and illustrated in eqs 1 5 firstly the inspired g c3n4 nanosheets by irradiation causes the separation of electrons e and vb leading to the generation of h and e eq 1 due to the cb potential 1 07 ev vs nhe is more negative than the reduction o2 radical o2 potential 0 33 ev vs nhe o2 can be generated by the reaction of e with o2 trapped on g c3n4 nanosheets surface eq 2 wu et al 2020b however the oh cannot be formed by the oxidation of h2o or oh by h because the vb potential 1 53 ev falls behind the reduction potential of oh h2o 2 73 ev vs nhe or oh oh 1 99 ev vs nhe thus the oh should be generated via eq 3 0 69 v vs nhe and eq 4 jiang et al 2018 finally o2 h and oh react with antibiotics to produce various degradation products eq 5 1 g c 3 n 4 h ν h e 2 o 2 e o 2 3 o 2 2 h e h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 e oh o h 5 o 2 h an d oh nor otc smx products photocatalytic degradation products of nor were determined by lc q tof ms analysis under simulated sunlight irradiation at different reaction time to further understand nor degradation process based on 1 the mass charge ratio m z of the molecular ion peak obtained by high resolution mass spectrometry 2 fragment ions in the product ion spectra and 3 previous reports eleven products were identified and their detailed ms and ms2 description was shown in table s1 and fig s7 beside the proposed structure of nor degradation products were much accurate owing to much small error 5 ppm between measured and theoretical m z in order to judge the sequence of each product formation the temporal peak area changes of all nor products were illustrated in fig s8 based on analysis of active species and products three potential photocatalytic degradation pathways of nor were speculated as in fig 6 pathway 1 started with the reaction of oh attacking the c atom bonded with f atom and this reaction needed an activation energy of 2 35 ev that was lower than the oxidation potential of oh li et al 2017 thus the hydroxyl group could replace the f atom to form primary product p318 then the product p318 will be further undergone the oxidation by o2 piperazine ring opening and cleavage of phenolic hydroxyl group to produce p322 and p304 pathway 2 was initiated via the oxidation of c atom on piperazine ring by o2 to generate p334 which lc ms extracted ion chromatogram eic exhibited three peaks with different retention times illustrating three possible isomers contained table s1 frontier orbital theory was used to predict the structures of three isomers of p334 and 2 e h o m o 2 value of each c atom on piperazine ring in nor molecule was shown in fig s9 according to the theory the c atom with higher 2 e h o m o 2 value is favorable to be oxidized by oxidant qu et al 2015 li et al 2019b so it is speculated that the order of oxidation of c atoms on the piperazine ring of nor by o2 is as follows c19 c15 c18 c16 hence possible structures of three isomers of p334 are shown in the fig 6 then p334 will further be oxidated by o2 or h generated by g c3n4 photocatalyst to successively form oxidation and ring opening products as illustrating in fig 6 besides the loss of carboxyl group of nor molecule was the necessary step for the progress of pathway 3 but the decarboxylation product was not detected in this study which might be due to the instability and high reactivity of decarboxylation product oxidized rapidly to generate subsequent product p296 in short the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of nor was mainly because that the high oxidation capacity of photogenerated active species over g c3n4 nanosheets resulted in the destruction of nor molecules under irradiation 3 4 toxicity assessment of nor photocatalytic degradation process it is necessary to evaluate the toxicity of transformation products of contaminants that are because products may exhibit higher toxicity than their parent compounds causing higher environmental risks the acute toxicity variation to luminescent bacteria p phosphoreum of nor photo reaction solution under simulated sunlight irradiation was investigated and shown in fig 7 orange line the luminous inhibition of nor on luminescent bacteria was increased with the irradiation time from 0 min to 120 min in order to estimate which product was the cause of increased acute toxicity the ecosar software was employed to predict the acute and chronic toxicity of nor and its products table 1 it was found that the predicted acute toxicity of p318 p251 and p296 and the predicted chronic toxicity of p318 p251 p279 p296 and p334 was higher than the parent compound suggesting these products should be responsible for the increased acute toxicity of luminescent bacteria as for the mechanism of toxicity of nor and its products on the tested organism luminescent bacteria the efficacy of quinolones antibacterial activities are mainly dominated by the type of substituent and the substituted positions on quinolone skeleton li et al 2014 demonstrated that the acute toxicity of quinolones was heavily dependent on the atom charge and electronegativity in the present study nor s oxidation products bonded with more oxygen atoms than the parent compound led to the increase of its charge and electronegativity which might result in the increased toxicity of its products on the tested organism in addition although nor was almost completely removed in 40 min over g c3n4 nanosheets fig s1 the toc removal of nor photocatalytic reaction was only 12 5 at 120 min of irradiation indicating the low mineralization rate of photocatalytic treatment process of nor it is demonstrated that the increase of acute toxicity of nor photocatalytic reaction solution should be attributed to many unmineralized products of nor 3 5 microalgae treatment of nor and its photocatalytic products in order to further remove the residual nor and its degradation products after photocatalytic process two common freshwater microalgae s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa were employed to treat the nor reaction solution after 40 min irradiation compared with the control group the growth of each microalga exposed to the nor reaction solution was not significant inhibited fig s10 suggesting that the toxicity of the nor reaction solution to microalgae was lower than that to luminescent bacteria so the acute toxicity observed to the luminescent bacterium might be not generalized to other species however luminescent bacteria showed the high sensitivity to toxicants may be just the reason why many researchers use luminescent bacteria as a model organism to evaluate toxic effects of toxicants kuang et al 2013 yu et al 2021 zhu et al 2021b nie et al 2009 reported that the 96 h ec50 for growth inhibition of s obliquus by nor was 38 49 mg l which was much higher than the exposure concentration of nor 9 0 mg l on s obliquus in this study hence the inhibitory effect of nor on the growth of microalgae was not observed simultaneously the variation of the residual nor and its degradation products in reaction solution was verified by lc q tof ms analysis to evaluate the effect of microalgae treatment on the nor reaction solution and the detailed calculation of the treatment effect of microalgae on nor and its degradation products was shown in text s7 as shown in fig 8 a and table s2 there was a great difference of the removal of the residual nor and each degradation product by two microalgae treatment in the control group without microalgae the concentration of the residual nor did not show a significant change while the concentration of p334 p318 and p296 showed an obvious decline indicating their unstable structure and high reactivity simultaneously as follow up products of p334 and p318 the amount of p332 p304 p251 and p236 exhibited a rising trend which also partly confirmed the chemical instability of p334 and p318 as for s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa treatments the similar phenomena were observed specifically p350 p334 p332 p318 and p279 were removed significantly but the concentration of p322 p304 p296 p294 p251 and p236 increased significantly compared with the control group the introduction of microalgae promoted the degradation of some photocatalytic degradation products of nor while other products amount increased meanwhile the degradation of the initial nor solution without irradiation by the two microalgae was also investigated to examine the ability of microalgae to decompose nor the results table s3 showed that the removal of nor by s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa were only 2 7 and 2 1 respectively indicating the limitation of the nor removal efficiency by microalgae in this study fortunately several intermediates were identified as p322 p296 and p251 by the treatment of s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa at 11 d therefore the increase of some products e g p322 p304 p296 p294 p251 and p236 in microalgae treatment system should be attributed to the transformation of nor and its photocatalytic degradation products by microalgae 3 6 toxicity assessment of microalgae treatment in order to understand the environmental risk of nor reaction solution treated by microalgae the acute toxicity of treated nor solution by s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa to p phosphoreum was investigated as shown in fig 8b the luminous inhibition values of the control group nor photocatalytic solution of 40 min irradiation fluctuated with cultivation time but no significant increase or decrease of acute toxicity was observed as for two microalgae treatment groups an opposite toxic effect appeared at s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa treatment the acute toxicity of the s obliquus treatment group increased with cultivation time while that of c pyrenoidosa treatment was just the opposite the difference in toxicity of two microalgae treatment groups may be due to the different types of degradation products in the s obliquus treatment group the formation of the product p296 that toxicity was proved to be elevated than nor by the ecosar analysis table 1 increased by 187 9 while that value was only 4 0 in the c pyrenoidosa treatment group table s2 thus it is reasonable to speculate that the increased toxicity of s obliquus treatment could be attributed to the excess production and accumulation of highly toxic p296 4 conclusions the combination of photocatalysis and microalgae processes for the efficient removal and reducing environmental risk of typical antibiotics was comprehensively investigated in this study g c3n4 nanosheets were synthesized by a thermal polymerization process 550 c of urea in n2 atmosphere and systematically characterized using sem tem xrd ft ir bet and uv vis drs the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets had sheet structure with large specific surface area and mesoporous structure and typical structure of g c3n4 the repeat of tri s triazine units 100 and the interlayer π π stacking 002 the narrow eg 2 6 ev was conducive to the efficient production of active species the irradiation wavelength and solution ph have great influences on the photocatalytic degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets the former is mainly because of irradiation wavelength on the yield and types of active species and the latter can affect the surface potential of g c3n4 nanosheets form of nor and types of free radicals the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets showed excellent photocatalytic performance for removal of three typical antibiotics nor otc and smx even under complex environmental conditions e g high concentration of dom and low concentration pollutants and show good stability and reusability although o2 h and oh are all participated in the photocatalytic degradation of three typical antibiotics over g c3n4 nanosheets o2 is the primary contributor three potential photocatalytic degradation pathways of nor were speculated as hydroxyl substitution reaction oxidation reaction and decarboxylation reaction the acute toxicity of nor photocatalytic reaction solution increased because of the formation of many unmineralized products of nor the introduction of microalgae promoted the degradation of some photocatalytic degradation products of nor and c pyrenoidosa treatment resulted in the decrease of toxicity of nor reaction solution in a short the combination of photocatalysis and microalgae technology can further remove typical antibiotic and its photocatalytic degradation products and reduce its environmental risk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16346,antibiotic contamination has become the primary environmental concern due to its potential to induce the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args to obtain the efficient antibiotic removal approach the combination of photocatalysis and microalgae technology for the efficient removal and reducing environmental risk of three typical antibiotics norfloxacin oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole was demonstrated in this study the g c3n4 material with advantages of low cost simple synthesizing nontoxic and wider spectral absorption was selected and synthesized by an easy thermal polymerization process of urea characterization results showed that the prepared material exhibited a typical structure of g c3n4 and irregular nanosheet structure with the large bet surface area and mesoporous structure the irradiation wavelength and solution ph showed great influences on the photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin over g c3n4 nanosheets o2 h and oh generated by the photocatalysis of g c3n4 nanosheets were confirmed based on energy band results and electron spin resonance detection while o2 was the main contributor to the antibiotics degradation in accordance with scavenging experiments many nor photocatalytic products were identified and degradation pathway was proposed due to the formation of many unmineralized products the acute toxicity of nor photocatalytic reaction solution was increased and then the introduction of microalgae promoted the degradation of some photocatalytic degradation products of nor but only chlorella pyrenoidosa treatment resulted in the decrease of toxicity of nor reaction solution this study provides useful information on the application of the combination of photocatalysis and microalgae technology for removal of antibiotics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalysis microalgae technology antibiotics norfloxacin mechanism detoxification 1 introduction as very effective medicines for microbial infections antibiotics have been extensively used and have a lot benefits to human and livestock health over the past decades yun et al 2021 since only partially absorption by organisms and incomplete degradation by sewage treatment facilities antibiotics are continuously released and accumulated in the natural water environment kümmerer 2009 at present antibiotics have been detected in various water environments such as rivers lakes groundwater seawater and even drinking water rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 huang et al 2020 for instance feng et al 2020 reported that the average concentrations of eight antibiotics were 46 4 ng l and 88 45 ng l in five urban and four township drinking water sources in chongqing area of the yangtze river in addition antibiotics possess high biological toxicity to aquatic organisms even at low concentrations however more seriously they can induce the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args that would impair the curative abilities of antibiotics causing serious threat to human health and ecological risks zainab et al 2020 many kinds of antibiotics including fluoroquinolones sulfonamides tetracyclines macrolides and β lactams were used for related disease prevention and treatment and detected in multiple environmental media as several important antibiotics fluoroquinolones sulfonamides and tetracyclines have been widely used all over the world in particular usages of these antibiotics account for 17 5 and 7 of total antibiotics in china for 2013 zhang et al 2015 norfloxacin nor a fluoroquinolone antibiotic with the largest use is the top 5 antibiotics used in china and has been detected in the level of ng l to μg l in various water environments zhang et al 2015 chen and wang 2020 meanwhile oxytetracycline otc and sulfamethoxazole smx belonging to tetracyclines and sulfonamides have been extensively produced and consumed and the concentration of otc and smx can reach 82 59 1 90 μg l and 63 6 μg l in the wastewater from animal farms zhi et al 2018 wei et al 2011 besides these antibiotics even at trace levels could induce the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes args and cause teratogenicity and genotoxicity posing threat to organisms and ecosystem safety bilal et al 2020 consequently it is urgent to develop the effective technology for the removal of antibiotics from aqueous environment the application of photocatalytic technology to curb organic pollutants in water environment has been recognized as a most promising method fan et al 2021 li et al 2021a since the discovery of photocatalytic decompose water by titanium dioxide tio2 the synthesis modification and application of tio2 has gained huge attention in the past few decades fujishima and honda 1972 tio2 has exhibited the high capacity for the photocatalytic degradation of fluoroquinolone antibiotics however owing to its wide band gap 3 2 ev for the anatase phase tio2 can only activated by the uv irradiation λ 380 nm chen et al 2017 thus great efforts have been paid to develop novel photocatalysts with better visible light response and encouragingly many other semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed and their photocatalytic performances were verified via characterization technologies and photocatalytic experiments zhu et al 2019 2021a among these photocatalytic materials the graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has garnered intensive attention because of its low cost simple synthesizing nontoxic and wider spectral absorption ong et al 2016 li et al 2021b g c3n4 has been utilized to cut down various environmental contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps wu et al 2020a nevertheless due to the low mineralization efficiency or taking longer irradiation time to achieve high mineralization of photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics there are generally many photocatalytic intermediates in the reaction system li et al 2021c which may lead to the increase of the toxicity of the photocatalytic reaction solution bechambi et al 2016 this may partially limit the application potential of g c3n4 to remove antibiotic contamination the activated sludge process has been one of the most widely used sewage treatment technologies because of its low cost mature technology convenient operation and large wastewater treatment capacity liu 2003 however although antibiotics can be transformed and degraded by activated sludge the conventional activated sludge process cannot completely remove antibiotics from sewage göbel et al 2005 in fact genes that encode for enzymes that biotransformed antibiotics are a type of antibiotic resistance gene because those biotransformations protect the cell from the antibiotic so antibiotic resistant bacteria and args would be induced and spread in the long term in the conventional sewage treatment system and pose serious impacts on ecological environment and human health li and zhang 2010 it is considered that conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been the main reservoir for args li and zhang 2011 consequently another biological treatment process microalgae based technology has gradually attracted the attention of scientists which possesses many advantages such as solar driven low cost environment friendliness carbon fixation and resource utilization potential xiong et al 2018 antibiotics can be effectively removed by microalgae based technology from antibiotics containing wastewater but its removal efficiency is highly dependent on the species of algae leng et al 2020 for example chlorella showed a high removal activity for many antibiotics e g cefradine cefalexin amoxicillin cefixime and ceftazidime while the performance of other algae species is unsatisfactory for the antibiotic removal such as microcystis aeruginosa chlamydomonas mexicana and nannochloris sp leng et al 2020 the removal mechanisms mainly involve adsorption bio transformation and degradation accumulation and hydrolysis of antibiotics moreover the removal of antibiotics by microalgae based technology generally is time consuming therefore an innovative concept that is integrating microalgae based technology with other treatment processes e g advanced oxidation processes is feasible for the enhancement of antibiotics removal xiong et al 2018 it is reported that photodegradation products of antibiotics are vulnerable to degrade into nontoxic entities by microalgae biodegradation which could reduce the cost and ecological risks liu et al 2017 recently chen et al 2020 reported that the prepared monoclinic bivo4 combining with microalgae dictyosphaerium sp exhibited an efficient removal for sulfamethazine under visible light irradiation but authors declared that the degradation by products of sulfamethazine and detoxification in the reaction processes still needed further investigation however there are only few studies on the integration of microalgae based antibiotic removal with photocatalysis technology hence in consideration of low cost simple synthesizing nontoxic and wider spectral absorption the g c3n4 photocatalyst was selected in combination with two kinds of microalgae scenedesmus obliquus s obliquus and chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa to investigate the removal process of three typical antibiotics nor otc and smx firstly the g c3n4 photocatalyst were synthesized via urea thermal polymerization process and characterized using various analysis technologies secondly the photocatalytic degradation kinetics and mechanism of nor otc and smx by g c3n4 photocatalyst were systematically investigated and the reaction pathway of nor was proposed based on products analysis and theoretical calculation thirdly two microalgae were introduced to treat the photocatalytic reaction solution of nor and the toxicity of the photocatalytic reaction and the microalgae treatment solution of nor was also evaluated the studied joint technology can be used in the advanced treatment process of traditional sewage treatment plants to improve the effluent quality or specially used for purification and treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the detailed information of chemicals and reagents was described in supporting materials text s1 2 2 preparation and characterization of g c3n4 nanosheets the g c3n4 nanosheets were synthesized via urea thermal polymerization process in n2 atmosphere a ceramic crucible containing 10 0 g urea was placed in a tubular furnace slg1100 100 shanghai litres of the testing instrument co ltd china then the temperature was raised to 550 c at the rate of 5 c min and kept for 4 h in n2 atmosphere after cooling the prepared material underwent grinding washing anhydrous ethanol centrifuging and drying to obtain g c3n4 nanosheets the obtained nanosheets were placed in a dark and dry place for further characterization and photocatalytic experiments all of characterization technologies were described in supporting materials text s1 2 3 batch photocatalytic typical antibiotics degradation experiments the photocatalytic experiments of three typical antibiotics nor otc and smx were carried out in an xpa 7g5 photoreactor equipped with a 350 w xenon lamp as the simulated solar irradiation nanjing xu jiang electromechanical factory china 50 0 ml of 10 0 mg l antibiotics aqueous solution prepared in ultra pure water was placed in each quartz tube which contained 10 0 mg of g c3n4 nanosheets 0 2 g l of catalyst concentration the prepared samples containing antibiotics and g c3n4 nanosheets were sonicated for 5 min to achieve a better dispersion of the catalyst in the reaction solution for achieving adsorption equilibrium of antibiotics the reaction solution sample was stirred for 60 min on a magnetic stirrer in dark condition then the xe lamp was set off and 2 0 ml of reaction suspension was sucked out by a pipette and put into a centrifuge tube at each set time interval subsequently the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 13 000 rpm and the obtained supernatant also needed filtering through 0 22 µm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane the residual antibiotics concentration in the filtrate was determined by an agilent 1260 infinity high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector hplc dad united states moreover the 10 ml of nor sample was taken out for toc analysis at each set time interval and only one sample 10 ml was taken at one quartz tube and the other time point was sampling at another quartz tube the effect of irradiation wavelength on photocatalytic reaction was realized by adding filter λ 400 nm or without filter λ 290 nm the effect of ph on photocatalytic performance of g c3n4 nanosheets was investigated via adjusting the initial solution ph to 3 5 7 9 and 11 using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide and the effect of dissolved organic matter dom on the photocatalytic reaction over g c3n4 nanosheets was examined by adding different concentrations gradients of humic acid 0 1 and 10 mg l the photocatalytic performance of the prepared photocatalyst for removal of low concentration antibiotics was also evaluated by setting the initial concentration of nor solution at 20 μg l the treatment group without g c3n4 nanosheets and the control group without irradiation were also carried out at the same time all experiments were carried out in triplicate and at 20 c 2 4 degradation of nor and its photocatalytic products by microalgae two kinds of widespread freshwater microalgae s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa were selected to study their performance to degrade nor and its photocatalytic degradation products the source and cultural methods of microalgae are shown in supporting materials text s2 the exponential growth phase and healthy microalgae was used in further alga growth inhibition tests and nor degradation experiments the cultivation of microalgae and degradation experiments of nor reaction solutions by microalgae were carried out in a gxz 500b led constant temperature light incubator ningbo jiangnan co ltd china 10 ml of s obliquus or c pyrenoidosa was inoculated into the bg11 media with 90 ml of nor reaction solutions 10 0 mg l of initial concentration of different photocatalytic reaction time that included two types of nor rection samples irradiated in simulated sunlight λ 290 nm for 40 min and initial nor solution without irradiation the reactor is a 250 ml transparent conical flask control group with nor rection samples but no microalgae inoculated was also implemented to monitor possible changes of nor and its photocatalytic products in the same cultural condition blank group with microalgae and no nor and its products was conducted to observe the growth of microalgae in order to ensure the growth rate of microalgae the inoculation concentration of each microalga was the same 10 of the inoculation volume and not less than 106 ml and each microalgae density was measured at 0 1 2 4 7 and 11 d to investigate the growth of microalgae the determination method of microalgae density was used the linear equation between algal cell density number of algal cells was counted using a hemacytometer and the absorbance at 680 nm and the detailed method was described in text s3 2 0 ml of microalgae treated reaction solutions were sampled at 0 d and 11 d and centrifuged at 8000 rpm then supernatants were filtered through 0 22 μm ptfe membrane to collect filtrate for analyzing changes of nor and its photocatalytic products and possible new degradation products by microalgae degradation 2 5 toxicity tests of nor photocatalysis and microalgae degradation solution the acute toxicity of nor reaction solution by photocatalysis and microalgae degradation was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of a luminescent bacterium photobacterium phosphoreum t3 spp the lyophilized luminescent bacteria powder was purchased from shenzhen labsun scientific instrument co ltd china and toxicity test method of luminescent bacteria referred to the previous study li et al 2018 the lyophilized powder of p phosphoreum was first activated using a small volume of cold 2 nacl solution and then enough volume of 3 nacl solution was added to prepared luminescent bacteria working solution for the photocatalytic process before used for toxicity test nor reaction solutions 10 0 mg l of initial concentration with different reaction time were centrifuged and filtered to remove g c3n4 nanosheets in addition microalgae should also be removed from nor reaction solution in the toxicity evaluation of microalgae degradation of nor and its products 500 μl of nor reaction solutions 9 0 mg l with 10 v v nacl solution and 500 µl of p phosphoreum working solution were mixed and oscillated for 15 min then the bioluminescence intensity of each group was measured using a portable luminescent bacterial toxicity detector lumifox 2000 shenzhen labsun scientific instrument co ltd china the control treatment was the mixture of 500 µl of p phosphoreum working solution and 500 µl of 3 nacl solution the luminous inhibition was calculated according to the formula i 1 t t c 0 t 0 c t 100 where i is the luminous inhibition rate of the test solution t0 and tt are the luminous intensity value at time 0 and t of containing nor reaction solutions treatment group c0 and ct are the luminous intensity value at time 0 and t of the control group 2 6 analysis an agilent 1260 infinity hplc usa was used for the determination of residual concentration of antibiotics in photocatalytic reaction but the low concentration sample of nor 20 μg l was analyzed using a thermo scientific ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatography instrument uhplc coupled with an ab sciex qtrap 4500 lc ms system photocatalysis and microalgae degradation products of nor were measured utilizing an agilent 1290 infinity ii uhplc coupled with a bruker maxis q tof ms system equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 µm the variation of total organic carbon toc in photocatalytic process was also analyzed the detailed information of the above analysis methods was shown in the supporting materials text s4 2 7 identification of active species an jeol jes fa200 electron spin resonance esr spectrometer japan was employed to detect potential free radicals in g c3n4 nanosheets photocatalytic reaction and the detailed determination method was shown in the supporting materials text s5 in addition free radicals scavenging experiments were performed utilizing isopropanol ipa l ascorbic acid l aa and ammonium oxalate ao as free radical scavengers to investigate roles of oh o2 and h on the photocatalytic degradation of three typical antibiotics 2 8 theoretical calculation molecular orbital calculation was implemented at the b3lyp 6 311g level to optimize the structural geometry of nor using the gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 li et al 2019a the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo was obtained from gaussian output file and the value of 2 e h o m o 2 was calculated to predict the most reactive part for electron extraction from nor molecular 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of g c3n4 nanosheets the micromorphology of g c3n4 nanosheets was observed by scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem technologies fig 1 a and b as shown in sem image the prepared g c3n4 material was consisted of a great quantity of curly thin sheets which led to the fluffy structure formation and enhanced the interaction between photocatalyst and pollutants and the wrinkle like sheet structure of g c3n4 was also observed in tem image according to the x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig 1c two major diffraction peaks 13 2 and 27 6 were marked out and assigned to the 100 and 002 crystal planes of g c3n4 nanosheets which were attributed to the repeat of tri s triazine units and the interlayer π π stacking yan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 from the result of n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 1d the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets with a bet surface area of 39 38 m2 g showed a representative type iv adsorption isotherm with h3 type hysteresis loop at a relative pressure spanning 0 45 1 0 p p0 which suggested the mesoporous structure li et al 2021d meanwhile the bjh pore size distribution curve of g c3n4 nanosheets exhibited a strong peak at 3 7 nm and a weaker peak at 31 1 nm belonging to mesoporous which further confirmed the mesoporous structure of g c3n4 nanosheets additionally in order to further characterize the types of chemical bonds ft ir analysis was used to identify bonding details of g c3n4 nanosheets fig 1e a sharp peak at 805 cm 1 was contributed by the bending vibration of tri s triazine units and a cluster of strong absorption peaks at 1000 1700 cm 1 should be assigned to the c n stretching vibrations in the cn heterocycles while the broad absorption peaks at 3000 3400 cm 1 related to the stretch vibration of uncondensed amino groups and adsorbed water molecules of g c3n4 sample surface li et al 2015 the light absorption characteristic and electronic band structure of g c3n4 nanosheets were examined and calculated based on uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra fig 1f the fundamental absorption edge of prepared g c3n4 nanosheets was 516 nm that corresponded to 2 6 ev of bandgap e g calculated based on kubelka munk equation compared with previous studies in this work the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets exhibit an increased visible light absorption and a narrower bandgap indicating the improvement of visible light utilization and photocatalytic performance of the synthetic material li et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 which may be mainly due to nanosheet the mesoporous structure meanwhile according to empirical equations text s6 chen et al 2014 the valence band maximum vbm and conduction band minimum cbm of g c3n4 nanosheets were derived as 1 53 ev and 1 07 ev respectively 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of typical antibiotics firstly the effect of irradiation wavelength on photocatalytic degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets was evaluated via the utilization of filter λ 400 nm to simulate visible light irradiation fig 2 a pseudo first order kinetic constants k obs of nor photocatalytic degradation with or without g c3n4 nanosheets at different wavelengths are shown in fig 2b and detailed degradation and fitting curves are listed in supporting materials fig s1 obviously the k obs of nor was raised from 0 0168 min 1 to 0 1015 min 1 0 to 0 0048 min 1 under simulated sunlight λ 290 nm and visible light irradiation respectively suggesting the excellent photocatalytic performance of the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets however the irradiation wavelength has a great influence on the performance of g c3n4 nanosheets such as the k obs of simulated sunlight irradiation is 21 times higher than that of visible light irradiation and this might be explained that much more active species were generated under the simulated sunlight irradiation than visible light irradiation discussion in section 3 3 moreover in order to examine the photocatalytic performance of prepared g c3n4 nanosheets on other antibiotics otc and smx were selected to carry out the photocatalytic experiment under simulated sunlight irradiation as shown in fig 2c otc and smx degraded rapidly in the studied photocatalytic system and the order of k obs of three antibiotics was otc 0 1228 min 1 nor 0 1015 min 1 smx 0 0544 min 1 therefore the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets exhibited excellent applicability on the photocatalytic degradation of various antibiotics as a key factor on photocatalytic reaction the solution ph would possess direct influences on the surface charge of photocatalyst forms of ionizable compounds and species and quantity of active species in the photocatalytic systems the photocatalytic degradation rates of nor at various ph values 3 5 7 9 and 11 were examined under simulated sunlight and visible light irradiation which were illustrated in figs 3 a and s2 a significant effect of ph on the photocatalytic degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets was found under simulated sunlight irradiation and both strong acid ph 3 5 and alkali ph 11 environment are not favorable for nor degradation while the maximum nor degradation rate k obs 0 0966 min 1 was observed at ph 9 primarily at strong acid ph 3 or alkali ph 11 conditions the zeta potentials of g c3n4 nanosheets are more positive or negative fig 3b respectively meanwhile nor is ionized into positive or negative ionic forms fig 3c thus the repulsion between the catalyst and nor species might reduce the adsorption capacity of g c3n4 nanosheets resulting in the decrease of nor degradation efficiency in addition according to the analysis of photocatalytic mechanism in section 3 3 the consumption reduction of o2 proved to be the main active species for nor degradation and the production and consumption of o2 are shown in eqs 1 4 thus the consumption reduction of o2 proved to be the main active species for nor degradation could be considered as the reason to explain the increased degradation rate of nor from ph 5 to 9 in order to investigate the photocatalytic performance of the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets in the presence of dissolved organic matter dom a representative dom humic acid ha was examined using three concentration gradients 0 1 and 10 mg l generally high concentration of humic acid ha would inhibit the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst mainly due to the light shielding and absorption or quenching on reactive oxygen species ros li et al 2021a surprisingly no inhibition but a little promotion p 0 05 for the photocatalytic degradation of nor by g c3n4 in two studied concentrations of ha was observed figs 4 a and s3 previous studies have reported that dom can be excited under irradiation to generate a variety of active species e g excited dom oh and 1o2 to enhance the degradation of organic pollutants zhang et al 2019 therefore it is reasonable to speculate that formation of active species in the presence of ha should be responsible for the increased nor degradation efficiency via the photocatalysis of g c3n4 nanosheets in addition in order to verify the photocatalytic degradation of nor in realistic environmental conditions by the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets a relatively low initial concentration of nor 20 μg l was selected to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets as shown in fig 4b nor with an initial concentration of 20 μg l has been completely removed after 5 min of irradiation while the treatment with an initial concentration of 10 mg l nor must take 40 min to achieve the same removal effect meanwhile the adsorption of low concentration of nor 20 μg l by the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets is more favorable than that of high concentration of nor 10 mg l therefore the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets can effectively catalyze the photodegradation of nor even under complex environmental conditions e g high concentration of dom and low concentration pollutants furthermore the stability and reusability of the synthesized g c3n4 nanosheets was evaluated via three successive cycles of nor photocatalytic degradation experiments as shown in fig 4c the removal of nor did not show a significant decline and still reach 98 6 in the third cycle thus the synthesized g c3n4 nanosheets show good stability and reusability 3 3 photocatalytic mechanism to understand the photocatalytic mechanism of g c3n4 nanosheets the esr technology was used and adduct signals of spin trapping agent with free radicals under sunlight irradiation were shown in fig 5 a c specifically signals of dmpo o2 and dmpo oh adducts were identified and their intensities both increased with the increase of irradiation time the notably decreasing tempo signal with increasing of irradiation time was observed fig 5c which is because the formation of holes over g c3n4 nanosheets could scavenge tempo radicals resulting in the esr signal reduction of tempo so this experimental result not only proved the generation of photogenerated holes h but also indirectly demonstrated the existence of photogenerated electrons e in the presence of g c3n4 nanosheets wang et al 2020 as a contrast esr signals of the g c3n4 nanosheets under visible light irradiation were also investigated using same spin trapping methods fig s4 weaker esr signals of dmpo o2 adduct were observed with the increasing visible light irradiation time while almost no esr signal of dmpo oh adduct was observed within the investigated time frame meanwhile the esr signal of tempo did not decrease significantly hence these results demonstrated that the insufficient capacity to generate enough active species under visible light irradiation should be responsible for the low photocatalytic degradation efficiency of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets in order to further investigate the role of active species in nor degradation several scavengers were used to scavenge related active species in the g c3n4 nanosheets photocatalytic reaction as a specific oh quencher k ipa oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 ipa was usually used to scavenge oh in photocatalytic reaction jones et al 2009 meanwhile ao and l aa were employed as scavenges of photogenerated h and o2 k l aa o2 2 7 105 m 1 s 1 respectively zhao et al 2020 nishikimi 1975 as shown in figs 5d and s5 with the introduction of three scavengers the decline of photodegradation rate constant of nor was observed and l aa showed the greatest inhibitory effect of nor degradation indicating o2 was the main active species involving the photocatalytic degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets additionally ipa and ao also showed inhibition on nor degradation while ao s inhibition was greater which suggested both oh and h contributed to the degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets hence it is demonstrated that o2 h and oh are all participated in the photocatalytic degradation of nor by g c3n4 nanosheets while o2 is the primary contributor to the degradation of nor meanwhile in order to verify the generalizability of the proposed photocatalytic mechanism of g c3n4 nanosheets quenching experiments of two other antibiotics otc and smx were also implemented using same scavengers in the g c3n4 nanosheets photocatalytic reaction fitted reaction rate constants of otc and smx were illustrated in fig 5e and f and detailed degradation and fitting curves were listed in supporting materials fig s6 the scavenger of l aa also showed the greatest inhibitory effect of otc and smx photodegradation indicating o2 was also the main active species involving in the photocatalytic degradation of these two compounds over g c3n4 nanosheets scavengers of ipa and ao also reduced the photodegradation rate of otc and smx but the inhibitory effect of these two scavengers was weaker than that of l aa which suggest that oh and h also had contributions to the photodegradation of otc and smx however o2 was the main active species for the removal of the selected antibiotics in this study furthermore based on potential values of vb 1 53 ev and cb 1 07 ev and results of esr and quenching experiments speculated photocatalytic mechanisms were proposed and illustrated in eqs 1 5 firstly the inspired g c3n4 nanosheets by irradiation causes the separation of electrons e and vb leading to the generation of h and e eq 1 due to the cb potential 1 07 ev vs nhe is more negative than the reduction o2 radical o2 potential 0 33 ev vs nhe o2 can be generated by the reaction of e with o2 trapped on g c3n4 nanosheets surface eq 2 wu et al 2020b however the oh cannot be formed by the oxidation of h2o or oh by h because the vb potential 1 53 ev falls behind the reduction potential of oh h2o 2 73 ev vs nhe or oh oh 1 99 ev vs nhe thus the oh should be generated via eq 3 0 69 v vs nhe and eq 4 jiang et al 2018 finally o2 h and oh react with antibiotics to produce various degradation products eq 5 1 g c 3 n 4 h ν h e 2 o 2 e o 2 3 o 2 2 h e h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 e oh o h 5 o 2 h an d oh nor otc smx products photocatalytic degradation products of nor were determined by lc q tof ms analysis under simulated sunlight irradiation at different reaction time to further understand nor degradation process based on 1 the mass charge ratio m z of the molecular ion peak obtained by high resolution mass spectrometry 2 fragment ions in the product ion spectra and 3 previous reports eleven products were identified and their detailed ms and ms2 description was shown in table s1 and fig s7 beside the proposed structure of nor degradation products were much accurate owing to much small error 5 ppm between measured and theoretical m z in order to judge the sequence of each product formation the temporal peak area changes of all nor products were illustrated in fig s8 based on analysis of active species and products three potential photocatalytic degradation pathways of nor were speculated as in fig 6 pathway 1 started with the reaction of oh attacking the c atom bonded with f atom and this reaction needed an activation energy of 2 35 ev that was lower than the oxidation potential of oh li et al 2017 thus the hydroxyl group could replace the f atom to form primary product p318 then the product p318 will be further undergone the oxidation by o2 piperazine ring opening and cleavage of phenolic hydroxyl group to produce p322 and p304 pathway 2 was initiated via the oxidation of c atom on piperazine ring by o2 to generate p334 which lc ms extracted ion chromatogram eic exhibited three peaks with different retention times illustrating three possible isomers contained table s1 frontier orbital theory was used to predict the structures of three isomers of p334 and 2 e h o m o 2 value of each c atom on piperazine ring in nor molecule was shown in fig s9 according to the theory the c atom with higher 2 e h o m o 2 value is favorable to be oxidized by oxidant qu et al 2015 li et al 2019b so it is speculated that the order of oxidation of c atoms on the piperazine ring of nor by o2 is as follows c19 c15 c18 c16 hence possible structures of three isomers of p334 are shown in the fig 6 then p334 will further be oxidated by o2 or h generated by g c3n4 photocatalyst to successively form oxidation and ring opening products as illustrating in fig 6 besides the loss of carboxyl group of nor molecule was the necessary step for the progress of pathway 3 but the decarboxylation product was not detected in this study which might be due to the instability and high reactivity of decarboxylation product oxidized rapidly to generate subsequent product p296 in short the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of nor was mainly because that the high oxidation capacity of photogenerated active species over g c3n4 nanosheets resulted in the destruction of nor molecules under irradiation 3 4 toxicity assessment of nor photocatalytic degradation process it is necessary to evaluate the toxicity of transformation products of contaminants that are because products may exhibit higher toxicity than their parent compounds causing higher environmental risks the acute toxicity variation to luminescent bacteria p phosphoreum of nor photo reaction solution under simulated sunlight irradiation was investigated and shown in fig 7 orange line the luminous inhibition of nor on luminescent bacteria was increased with the irradiation time from 0 min to 120 min in order to estimate which product was the cause of increased acute toxicity the ecosar software was employed to predict the acute and chronic toxicity of nor and its products table 1 it was found that the predicted acute toxicity of p318 p251 and p296 and the predicted chronic toxicity of p318 p251 p279 p296 and p334 was higher than the parent compound suggesting these products should be responsible for the increased acute toxicity of luminescent bacteria as for the mechanism of toxicity of nor and its products on the tested organism luminescent bacteria the efficacy of quinolones antibacterial activities are mainly dominated by the type of substituent and the substituted positions on quinolone skeleton li et al 2014 demonstrated that the acute toxicity of quinolones was heavily dependent on the atom charge and electronegativity in the present study nor s oxidation products bonded with more oxygen atoms than the parent compound led to the increase of its charge and electronegativity which might result in the increased toxicity of its products on the tested organism in addition although nor was almost completely removed in 40 min over g c3n4 nanosheets fig s1 the toc removal of nor photocatalytic reaction was only 12 5 at 120 min of irradiation indicating the low mineralization rate of photocatalytic treatment process of nor it is demonstrated that the increase of acute toxicity of nor photocatalytic reaction solution should be attributed to many unmineralized products of nor 3 5 microalgae treatment of nor and its photocatalytic products in order to further remove the residual nor and its degradation products after photocatalytic process two common freshwater microalgae s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa were employed to treat the nor reaction solution after 40 min irradiation compared with the control group the growth of each microalga exposed to the nor reaction solution was not significant inhibited fig s10 suggesting that the toxicity of the nor reaction solution to microalgae was lower than that to luminescent bacteria so the acute toxicity observed to the luminescent bacterium might be not generalized to other species however luminescent bacteria showed the high sensitivity to toxicants may be just the reason why many researchers use luminescent bacteria as a model organism to evaluate toxic effects of toxicants kuang et al 2013 yu et al 2021 zhu et al 2021b nie et al 2009 reported that the 96 h ec50 for growth inhibition of s obliquus by nor was 38 49 mg l which was much higher than the exposure concentration of nor 9 0 mg l on s obliquus in this study hence the inhibitory effect of nor on the growth of microalgae was not observed simultaneously the variation of the residual nor and its degradation products in reaction solution was verified by lc q tof ms analysis to evaluate the effect of microalgae treatment on the nor reaction solution and the detailed calculation of the treatment effect of microalgae on nor and its degradation products was shown in text s7 as shown in fig 8 a and table s2 there was a great difference of the removal of the residual nor and each degradation product by two microalgae treatment in the control group without microalgae the concentration of the residual nor did not show a significant change while the concentration of p334 p318 and p296 showed an obvious decline indicating their unstable structure and high reactivity simultaneously as follow up products of p334 and p318 the amount of p332 p304 p251 and p236 exhibited a rising trend which also partly confirmed the chemical instability of p334 and p318 as for s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa treatments the similar phenomena were observed specifically p350 p334 p332 p318 and p279 were removed significantly but the concentration of p322 p304 p296 p294 p251 and p236 increased significantly compared with the control group the introduction of microalgae promoted the degradation of some photocatalytic degradation products of nor while other products amount increased meanwhile the degradation of the initial nor solution without irradiation by the two microalgae was also investigated to examine the ability of microalgae to decompose nor the results table s3 showed that the removal of nor by s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa were only 2 7 and 2 1 respectively indicating the limitation of the nor removal efficiency by microalgae in this study fortunately several intermediates were identified as p322 p296 and p251 by the treatment of s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa at 11 d therefore the increase of some products e g p322 p304 p296 p294 p251 and p236 in microalgae treatment system should be attributed to the transformation of nor and its photocatalytic degradation products by microalgae 3 6 toxicity assessment of microalgae treatment in order to understand the environmental risk of nor reaction solution treated by microalgae the acute toxicity of treated nor solution by s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa to p phosphoreum was investigated as shown in fig 8b the luminous inhibition values of the control group nor photocatalytic solution of 40 min irradiation fluctuated with cultivation time but no significant increase or decrease of acute toxicity was observed as for two microalgae treatment groups an opposite toxic effect appeared at s obliquus and c pyrenoidosa treatment the acute toxicity of the s obliquus treatment group increased with cultivation time while that of c pyrenoidosa treatment was just the opposite the difference in toxicity of two microalgae treatment groups may be due to the different types of degradation products in the s obliquus treatment group the formation of the product p296 that toxicity was proved to be elevated than nor by the ecosar analysis table 1 increased by 187 9 while that value was only 4 0 in the c pyrenoidosa treatment group table s2 thus it is reasonable to speculate that the increased toxicity of s obliquus treatment could be attributed to the excess production and accumulation of highly toxic p296 4 conclusions the combination of photocatalysis and microalgae processes for the efficient removal and reducing environmental risk of typical antibiotics was comprehensively investigated in this study g c3n4 nanosheets were synthesized by a thermal polymerization process 550 c of urea in n2 atmosphere and systematically characterized using sem tem xrd ft ir bet and uv vis drs the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets had sheet structure with large specific surface area and mesoporous structure and typical structure of g c3n4 the repeat of tri s triazine units 100 and the interlayer π π stacking 002 the narrow eg 2 6 ev was conducive to the efficient production of active species the irradiation wavelength and solution ph have great influences on the photocatalytic degradation of nor over g c3n4 nanosheets the former is mainly because of irradiation wavelength on the yield and types of active species and the latter can affect the surface potential of g c3n4 nanosheets form of nor and types of free radicals the prepared g c3n4 nanosheets showed excellent photocatalytic performance for removal of three typical antibiotics nor otc and smx even under complex environmental conditions e g high concentration of dom and low concentration pollutants and show good stability and reusability although o2 h and oh are all participated in the photocatalytic degradation of three typical antibiotics over g c3n4 nanosheets o2 is the primary contributor three potential photocatalytic degradation pathways of nor were speculated as hydroxyl substitution reaction oxidation reaction and decarboxylation reaction the acute toxicity of nor photocatalytic reaction solution increased because of the formation of many unmineralized products of nor the introduction of microalgae promoted the degradation of some photocatalytic degradation products of nor and c pyrenoidosa treatment resulted in the decrease of toxicity of nor reaction solution in a short the combination of photocatalysis and microalgae technology can further remove typical antibiotic and its photocatalytic degradation products and reduce its environmental risk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16347,ketoprofen ktf is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug frequently detected in natural and engineering waters because ktf is particularly photolabile half life 4 min knowledge of the fate and ecological risks of ktf photoproducts in the aquatic environment is especially essential herein we systematically investigated the photophysics photochemistry and photosensitization of ktf photoproducts in aqueous solution under 365 nm irradiation uv365 results show that ktf photolyzed rapidly and formed 3 ethyl α hydroxylbenzophenone etoh bp 3 ethyl α hydroperoxylbenzophenone etooh bp 3 acetylbenzophenone acbp and 3 ethylbenzophenone etbp as identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms the presence of o2 significantly affected the evolution of photoproducts during ktf photolysis the photophysical properties of etbp and acbp were characterized by spectroscopic approaches in particular transient absorption spectra obtained by nanosecond laser flash photolysis lfp indicated that etbp and acbp were excited to triplet states with lifetimes of 28 and 2 4 µs respectively etbp underwent further photodegradation giving rise to etoh bp etooh bp and acbp upon uv365 irradiation the reaction is proposed to proceed through an excimer precursor 3 etbp etbp followed by intramolecular h abstraction in contrast acbp was relatively photostable particularly under aerated condition both etbp and acbp have strong photosensitizing activity as evidenced by the triplet probe 4 n n dimethylamino benzonitrile dmabn ecosar program suggested that the photoproducts are more ecotoxic and bioaccumulative than the parent ktf results of this study underscore the need to scrutinize the formation and fate of ktf photoproducts in sunlit surface waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ketoprofen laser flash photolysis photophysics photoproducts photosensitization 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps including antibiotics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs β blockers lipid regulators analgesics and sunscreens etc are emerging trace organic contaminants trocs frequently detected in natural and engineering waters kümmerer 2009 these chemicals have continuously been released into natural waters through various routes including aquaculture wastewater discharge sewage treatment plant effluent and landfill leaching michael et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 yu et al 2020 although ppcps are present in the environment at ng l 1 to ug l 1 level they exhibit a characteristic of pseudo persistence due to the continuous discharge pattern kümmerer 2009 in addition as their molecular structures are often designed with specific biological effects ppcps may have potentially negative and cumulative effects on non target organisms keerthanan et al 2020 therefore the occurrence transformation and fate of ppcps in the aquatic environment have received extensive attention chen et al 2021 ketoprofen 2 3 benzoylphenyl propanoic acid ktf is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid widely prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis spondylitis and pain relief see chart 1 for molecular structure zhou et al 2014 ktf has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment with concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to µg l 1 kosjek et al 2005 while ktf is relatively recalcitrant toward biodegradation photochemical transformation is known to be an important process accounting for the fate of this nsaid in natural sunlit waters szabó et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the photoreactivity of ktf is derived from the benzophenone bp chromophore which can absorb photons under irradiation to generate reactive intermediates such as triplet excited states and free radicals martínez and scaiano 1997 nakajima et al 2005 musa et al 2007 hykrdová et al 2018 in addition due to the high energy and unique electronic configuration of triplet aromatic ketones t1 n π ktf has a strong photosensitizing potential and can cause photohemolysis lipid peroxidation as well as damage to proteins and nucleic acid chains through various mechanisms including electron transfer hydrogen abstraction energy transfer and paternò büchi reactions lhiaubet et al 2001 encinas et al 2004 lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 shinoda et al 2014 kashihara et al 2019 therefore after oral absorption ktf can produce photosensitizing effect on biomolecules resulting in phototoxicity or photoallergy such as cellular photohemolysis lipid peroxidation and nucleic acid chain damage boscá et al 1994 chignell and sik 1998 indeed the photobiological effects of ktf and other bp containing pharmaceuticals have been extensively studied boscá and miranda 1998 consuelo et al 2012 in environmental photochemistry the generation of photoproducts is worthy of particular attention because in some cases photoproducts tend to be more toxic than their parent compounds fatta kassinos et al 2011 indeed the possible production of harmful photoproducts is the dark side of the environmental photochemistry of contaminants vione and carena 2020 a well known example is triclosan tcs an antimicrobial agent widely used in personal care products such as soap and hand sanitizer the exposure of tcs to artificial or solar irradiation has been reported to generate highly toxic 2 8 dichlorodibenzo p dioxin through a 6π electrocyclization reaction initiated by photodehalogenation latch et al 2003 2005 kliegman et al 2013 therefore in order to completely and accurately evaluate the ecological risks of ppcps it is very necessary to study the transformation and fate of their photoproducts in the environment kümmerer 2009 fatta kassinos et al 2011 the ktf molecule features a bp chromophore and a propionic acid ch ch3 cooh side chain the former is an important chromophore enabling ktf to absorb photons to generate excited states or radical species while the latter can facilitate ktf to undergo direct photolysis through photodecarboxylation boscá et al 1994 martínez and scaiano 1997 cosa et al 1999 it has been reported that under neutral and alkaline conditions the ktf carboxylate pk a 4 7 undergoes monophotonic decarboxylation predominantly 90 and to a less extent biphotonic photoionization 10 martínez and scaiano 1997 these processes can trigger the photochemical reactions leading to the formation of benzylic carbanions or radicals martínez and scaiano 1997 musa et al 2007 using nanosecond laser flash photolysis lfp martínez and scaiano 1997 confirmed that the photolysis of ktf could produce 3 ethylbenzophenone etbp and 3 acetylbenzophenone acbp see chart 1 for molecular structures through protonation of a benzylic carbanion or hydrogen abstraction of a benzylic radical studies have shown that these photoproducts conserved the bp structure and as expected could photosensitize the damage of lipids proteins and nucleic acids under irradiation encinas et al 2004 consuelo et al 2012 boscá and miranda 1998 observed that reaction mixtures obtained upon irradiation of ktf in neutral aqueous medium were more toxic to cultured hepatocytes than non irradiated controls evidencing the higher toxicity of oxygenated photoproducts however up to now the photophysical photosensitizing and photochemical behaviors of ktf photoproducts are still largely unknown in natural environment and their ecological risks also warrant further assessment this scenario appears to be particularly urgent considering the fact that ktf can undergo rapid phototransformation in natural surface waters e g river water with a half life of only 4 min lin and reinhar 2005 this article was designed to fill the knowledge gaps associated with the photochemical behavior and photosensitizing potential of ktf photoproducts in the natural aquatic environment to do so we first attempted to identify the photoproducts of ktf and quantify their formation subsequently the photophysical properties of ktf photoproducts i e etbp and acbp were characterized by means of spectroscopic studies in particular nanosecond laser flash photolysis was applied to identify the transient species generated upon the excitation of etbp acbp by radiation meanwhile the kinetics and underlying mechanisms quantum yields photoproducts of the photodegradation of etbp acbp under 365 nm ultraviolet light uv365 irradiation were explored the photosensitizing potential of triplets 3etbp 3acbp was also tested using 4 n n dimethylamino benzonitrile also named alternatively 4 dimethylamino benzonitrile dmabn as a triplet probe molecule finally the ecotoxicity of ktf photoproducts was temporarily assessed by ecosar program results of this contribution may permit a more detailed understanding of the photochemical and photosensitizing behaviors of ktf photoproducts and their ecological risks in the natural aquatic environment 2

acbp by hplc 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolysis of ktf and formation of photoproducts exposure of ktf aqueous solution 40 µm ph 7 0 to uv365 irradiation led to rapid attenuation of this nsaid drug i e 85 removal percentage within 10 min fig s1 supporting information the photolysis reaction obeys pseudo first order kinetics and the pseudo first order rate constant k obs is determined to be 0 19 min 1 t 1 2 3 6 min the photolability of ktf observed in this study is consistent with previous reports lin and reinhar 2005 kotnik et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 interestingly the ktf concentration remained almost unchanged during the subsequent reaction time fig s1 possibly due to the competition for absorbing photons between ktf and photoproducts ktf has been known to undergo photolysis either through monophotonic decarboxylation or via biphotonic photoionization martínez and scaiano 1997 cosa et al 1999 the monophotonic decarboxylation is the dominant pathway 90 accounting for the photolysis of ktf carboxylate pk a 4 7 martínez and scaiano 1997 upon irradiation the ktf carboxylate undergoes a rapid decarboxylation within 1 ns or faster from the singlet excited state to yield a carbanion cosa 2004 such carbanion can undergo tautomerization to produce a ketyl biradical thus featuring spectroscopic properties from both a ketyl radical anion and a benzylic radical martínez and scaiano 1997 cosa et al 1999 cosa 2004 in neutral aqueous solution the carbanion with a lifetime of 150 ns undergoes rapid protonation to generate etbp whose photochemistry is less known see fig s2 a supporting information chignell and sik 1998 in the biphotonic photoionization process the ktf carboxylate first absorbs a photon being excited to the singlet state 1ktf which subsequently converts to the triplet excited state 3ktf through a rapid intersystem crossing isc process martínez and scaiano 1997 cosa et al 1999 due to the high molar absorption coefficient of 3ktf it can absorb another photon and then undergo photoionization to generate solvated electrons and ktf radicals nakajima et al 2005 the solvated electron reacts with the o2 in water to generate superoxide radical anion o2 while the ktf radical can undergo rapid decarboxylation to generate a benzylic radical wang et al 2017 the benzylic radical readily couples with o2 or reactive oxygen species ros such as 1o2 and o2 to generate 3 ethyl α hydroxylbenzophenone etoh bp 3 ethyl α hydroperoxylbenzophenone etooh bp and acbp see fig s2 b supporting information hykrdová et al 2018 it should be noted that a small fraction of benzylic radical can also undergo self coupling reactions to generate dimers boscá et al 1994 nakajima et al 2005 our attempt to identify the ktf photoproducts was implemented by concentrating the photolysate with spe followed by lc ms ms and hrms analyses see section 2 5 the structural assignments of ktf photoproducts were based on their retention times uv vis spectra accurate masses and fragmentation patterns of molecular ions as well as comparison with previous studies kosjek et al 2011 a total of four photoproducts were identified including etoh bp etooh bp acbp and etbp fig 1 and fig s3 of supporting information the identification of these photoproducts is in good agreement with previous studies kotnik et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 among these photoproducts etbp and acbp are commercially available therefore their qualification and quantification were further carried out by hplc analyses using authentic standards the formation of etbp and acbp during ktf photolysis was found to be closely related to the amount of o2 in water wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 fig 2 depicts the photodegradation of ktf and the evolution of etbp and acbp under aerated and deaerated conditions as can be seen 85 of ktf was rapidly degraded within 10 min regardless of the presence absence of o2 in the solution this is because ktf mainly undergoes monophotonic decarboxylation in neutral solution with 1ktf as a precursor cosa et al 1999 musa et al 2007 thus the presence of o2 had no significant impact on the photolysis rate of ktf in contrast the formation and conversion of photoproducts are highly dependent on the o2 wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 along with the degradation of ktf etbp was rapidly formed with its concentration reaching the maximum at 10 min under aerated conditions the concentration of etbp decreased slowly with prolonging time and the concentration of acbp increased steadily fig 2a under n2 degassed conditions however the concentration of etbp decreased rapidly after 10 min while the concentration of acbp exhibited a first increasing and then decreasing tendency fig 2b the discrepancy highlights the critical role of o2 in the formation and transformation of ktf photoproducts on the one hand o2 was involved in the formation of ktf photoproducts as evidenced by the continuous increase of acbp observed under aerated condition fig 2a wang et al 2017 reported that o2 favored the phototransformation of etbp to generate acbp through reactions with molecular o2 o2 and other ros on the other hand o2 was not conducive to the further conversion of etbp and acbp fig 2a we speculate that the presence of o2 might quench the triplet excited state through energy transfer thus inhibiting the conversion of etbp into acbp the triplet energy of bp derivatives is known to be 288 kj mol 1 which is high enough to transfer energy to o2 to generate 1o2 94 kj mol 1 mcneill and canonica 2016 3 2 spectroscopic characterization of etbp and acbp 3 2 1 uv vis absorption spectra the photophysical properties of etbp and acbp were characterized by spectroscopic analyses fig 3 displays the uv vis absorption spectra of etbp and acbp in aqueous solutions as can be seen the etbp aqueous solution containing 1 acn shows an obvious absorption band in the range of 230 300 nm with λ max at 260 nm ε max 19 230 m 1 cm 1 the absorption band tails to approximately 320 nm which is similar to the uv vis absorption spectrum of bp in aqueous solution data not shown this broad absorption band is mainly due to the strong conjugation between the benzene rings and the carbonyl group boscá et al 1994 lhiaubet et al 2000 solvatochromic experiment using acn as a solvent further confirmed the π π nature of the absorption band see detailed discussion in text s2 supporting information bp derivatives should also have an n π transition corresponding to an absorption at 360 nm turro et al 2010 however we did not observe the absorption band caused by n π transition likely due to the poor spatial overlap between n and π orbitals which results in weak oscillator strength and therefore negligible absorbance turro et al 2010 the uv vis absorption spectrum of acbp aqueous solution differs slightly from those of etbp and bp fig 3 most notably acbp is featured by a more broader absorption band ranging from 215 to 300 nm the λ max of acbp is located at 236 nm ε max 24 420 m 1 cm 1 and there is a shoulder peak at 260 nm besides the absorption intensity of acbp is greater than those of etbp and bp at the same concentrations these discrepancies are likely due to the fact that the carbonyl group in the acetyl branch of acbp molecule participates in the conjugation of bp moiety through electron delocalization despite these differences the uv vis absorption spectra of etbp and acbp both show a weak absorbance at 300 nm which can be overlapped with terrestrial solar spectrum therefore the photochemical transformation of etbp and acbp is likely to occur in natural sunlit surface waters boreen et al 2003 3 2 2 transient absorption spectra fig 4 describes the nanosecond transient absorption spectra obtained upon 266 nm laser flash photolysis of etbp acbp in nitrogen saturated neutral aqueous solutions as can be seen the transient absorption spectra of etbp show characteristic absorption bands within 300 350 nm λmax 320 and 330 nm and 480 550 nm λmax 525 nm fig 4a analogous to those of triplet ktf and other bp derivatives martínez and scaiano 1997 similar transient absorption spectra were obtained for acbp fig 4b with λmax at 320 and 525 nm which is in satisfactory agreement with triplet triplet bp like absorption turro et al 2010 we therefore assign the characteristic absorption bands to the triplet excited states of etbp acbp the formation of triplet states of bp like derivatives can be rationalized by a very high isc rate constant k isc 1011 1012 s 1 due to the strong spin orbit coupling soc boscá and miranda 1998 the triplets 3etbp and 3acbp decay by first order kinetics with a lifetime of 28 and 2 4 μs respectively in deaerated aqueous solutions with the absorption bands showing the same kintic behavior the presence of o2 in aerated solution significantly enhanced the decay of these transients fig 4 insets this further supports the assignment of the transients to the triplet excited states because triplets can be efficiently quenched by o2 through energy transfer to generate 1o2 mcneill and canonica 2016 quenching rate constants for 3etbp 3acbp and o2 were obtained by stern volmer plots following eq 2 2 k obs k 0 k q o 2 where k 0 is the triplet decay rate constant in the absence of o2 k q is the triplet quenching rate constant in the presence of o2 and o2 is the concentration of o2 based on the plots the rate constants for quenching 3etbp and 3acbp were determined to be 2 9 109 and 2 2 109 m 1s 1 respectively these values are in statisfactory agreement with that of 3bp 2 6 0 1 109 m 1s 1 measured in oxygenated water canonica et al 2000 3 3 photochemistry of etbp and acbp 3 3 1 quantum yields and products the aquatic photochemistry of etbp and acbp was investigated upon uv365 irradiation under both aerated and deaerated conditions fig 5 shows that etbp was photolabile under irradiation and its photolysis followed pseudo first order kinetics in particular deaerated condition was conducive to the photolysis of etbp k obs aerated 0 0037 min 1 vs k obs deaerated 0 015 min 1 the quantum yields of etbp photolysis were determined to be 0 61 and 2 46 mol e 1 respectively under aerated and deaerated conditions three photoproducts i e etoh bp etooh bp and acbp were identified during the photolysis of etbp among them acbp was the major product the generation of these products is closely related to the content of o2 as shown in fig 5a the concentration of acbp raised steadily in aerated solution while the concentration of etoh bp increased to a maximum and remained unchanged in the case of etooh bp its concentration was negligible in deoxygenated solution however the product concentrations exhibited a first increasing and then decreasing pattern in particular acbp etoh bp and etooh bp reached maximum values of 14 9 2 2 and 0 7 μm at 90 20 and 10 min respectively fig 5b the intermediacy of etoh bp and etooh bp concurs with their further transformation to acbp wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 fig 5a also shows that under aerated condition the etbp photolysis was characterized by a good mass balance this means that etbp was almost completely transformed via oxygen dependent pathway which stoichiometrically generated oxygenated photoproducts acbp etoh bp and etooh bp in contrast the mass balance of the photoproducts was poor under deaerated condition fig 5b this result can be explained by the fact that a fraction of benzylic radicals can self couple through an oxygen independent pathway to form dimers boscá et al 1994 due to the lack of authentic standards we could not quantify the concentrations of dimers further support in favor of the dimer forming pathway comes from the quantum yield obtained in deoxygenated solution 2 46 mol e 1 which is greater than 1 vide supra unlike etbp acbp appeared to be relatively photostable under aerated condition but slightly photolabile under deaerated condition fig s4 of supporting information the quantum yield of acbp in deaerated solution was determined to be 0 085 mol e 1 much lower than that of etbp the photostability of acbp implies the potential persistence of this photoproduct in the aquatic environment bp derivatives are well known 1o2 photosensitizers e g the quantum yield of 1o2 φδ for bp is 0 34 in the present study we investigated the reactivity of etbp acbp with 1o2 that was nonphotochemically generated through moo4 2 catalyzed disproportionation of h2o2 böhme and brauer 1992 the decay of ffa a well known 1o2 probe 1 0 108 m 1s 1 confirms the generation of 1o2 in the moo4 2 h2o2 system felcyn et al 2012 however no measurable degradation of etbp acbp was observed under identical experimental conditions suggesting that etbp acbp has low reactivity with 1o2 fig s5 supporting information 3 3 2 mechanisms for etbp and acbp photolysis the difference in product evolution during etbp photolysis under aerated deaerated conditions is related to its unique photochemistry the photoreactivity of etbp is likely driven by its lowest lying triplet excited state t1 n π which is a characteristic of bp derivatives boscá et al 1994 we speculate that etbp undergoes photochemical degradation through the following pathways r1 etbp hv 1 etbp isc 3 etbp r2 3 etbp etbp 3 etbp etbp r3 3 etbp etbp etbp h etbp h r4 etbp h o 2 acbp other oxygenated products r5 etbp h no o 2 dimers r6 etbp h o 2 etbp ho 2 o 2 under uv irradiation a fraction of etbp molecules is excited to singlet state 1etbp which undergoes fast isc to generate triplet state 3etbp due to efficient soc r1 due to its relatively long lifetime 28 μs 3etbp can encounter with a ground state etbp to form an excimer precursor 3 etbp etbp r2 subsequently intramolecular h abstraction or proton coupled electron transfer pcet occurs within the excimer leading to the formation of a radical pair comprising of a benzylic etbp h and a ketyl radical etbp h r3 similar excimer derived intramolecular electron or hydrogen transfer has previously been proposed for the photochemistry of chlorocarbazole an important photoproduct of the nsaid diclofenac encinas et al 1998 these radicals can escape from the solvent cage forming free radicals which convert to photoproducts via further reactions for example the benzylic radical can further transform either via oxygen dependent or oxygen independent pathways under aerated condition the benzylic radical is dominantly converted to acbp etoh bp and etooh bp by trapping o2 r4 as shown in scheme 1 under deaerated condition however a fraction of benzylic radicals is subjected to self coupling to form dimers through oxygen independent pathways r5 note that a fraction of etbp will be regenerated through elimination of ho2 o2 after coupling with o2 in aerated solution r6 wang et al 2017 unlike etbp acbp had a high photostability under aerated condition fig s4 of supporting information possibly because the presence of o2 quenched the triplet excited state 3acbp thereby inhibiting its photolysis the resistance to photolysis may also be explained by the fact that the branch chain of acbp favors the deactivation of 3acbp via nonradiative relaxation turro et al 2010 under deaerated condition a weak photodegradation of acbp was found possibly through norrish i reaction as typically observed in bp derivatives the norrish i reaction of acbp should produce acyl and alkyl diradical intermediates via bond cleavage α cleavage however the possibility of α cleavage reaction is determined by thermodynamics turro et al 2010 owning to the large bond energy of α c c o the excited acbp molecule is unlikely to undergo an efficient α cleavage reaction at room temperature for example the rate constant of α cleavage reaction k cl is expected to be 102 s 1 for bp acetone and propiophenone which is much lower than that of k ts 103 s 1 rate constant for isc process t1 s0 turro et al 2010 therefore α cleavage is not expected to be efficient for the photolysis of acbp 3 4 photosensitizing potential of etbp and acbp triplet aromatic ketones have strong photosensitizing activity due to their unique electronic configuration and relatively high energy mcneill and canonica 2016 the identified ktf photoproducts conserve the bp chromophore thus are expected to have photosensitizing ability under irradiation in this study we used dmabn as a molecular probe to evaluate the photosensitizing activity of etbp acbp triplet dmabn has been known to react with the triplet aromatic ketones through a single electron transfer mechanism to generate aminyl radicals or radical cations which are subjected to sequential n demethylation to produce mabn and abn see chart 1 for molecular structures leresche et al 2016 2019 the underlying mechanisms for the reaction between dmabn and triplet aromatic ketones are detailed in text s3 supporting information exposure of 15 µm dmabn aqueous solution ph 7 0 phosphate buffered to uv365 irradiation showed no measurable decay within 5 h indicating that the triplet probe was resistant to direct photolysis fig 6 a leresche et al 2016 in the presence of 10 µm etbp however an appreciable attenuation of dmabn was observed within 2 5 h fig 6b similar result was obtained when 10 µm acbp was spiked into dmabn solution as a photosensitizer fig s6 supporting information leresche et al 2016 suggested that the fractional contribution of 1o2 to the transformation of dmabn photosensitized by fulvic acid 5 mgc l 1 was lower than 5 the maximum second order rate constant for the reaction of dmabn and 1o2 was estimated to be 1 9 107 m 1s 1 leresche et al 2016 therefore the rapid degradation of dmabn highlights the sensitizing ability of ktf photoproducts upon uv365 irradiation the photosensitization of ktf photoproducts is most likely derived from their triplet excited state as evidenced by lfp studies fig 4 as expected the sensitized photolysis of dmabn generated mabn and abn sequentially r7 leresche et al 2016 the time dependent evolution of mabn and abn can be well fitted by the following sequential reaction kinetic models eqs 3 and 4 r7 dmabn k 1 mabn k 2 abn 3 mabn k 1 dmabn 0 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t 4 abn dmabn 0 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t k 1 k 2 k 1 e k 2 t where k 1 and k 2 represent the pseudo first order formation and degradation rate constants of mabn respectively this constitutes further support in favor of the electronic configuration of the lowest lying 3etbp 3acbp as t1 n π it is well known that n π excitation of the carbonyl compounds produces an alkoxy radical like excited state in which the electron deficiency at the oxygen induces typical radical reactivity in the molecule bhasikuttan et al 1998 it is worth noting that the concentration of acbp remained unchanged during the reaction on the contrary the concentration of etbp decreased steadily during the sensitized photolysis of dmabn data not shown therefore we speculate that acbp has a persistent photosensitizing ability while etbp may sensitize dmabn at the early stage as the reaction progressed it was the photoproducts i e acbp etoh bp and etooh bp rather than etbp per se that sensitized the photolysis of dmabn overall our results indicate that the ktf photoproducts possess photosensitizing ability due to the bp chromophore which is consistent with previous studies chignell and sik 1998 wang and wan 2015 upon solar irradiation these substances may sensitize the damage of biomolecules such as lipids proteins or nucleic acids in particular these photoproducts are also likely to sensitize the photolysis of electron rich contaminants such as anilines e g sulfonamide antibiotics and phenolics e g 17β estradiol in sunlit surface waters wenk and canonica 2012 canonica et al 2000 work is ongoing in our laboratory to investigate the photosensitizing effects of ktf photoproducts on the transformation of sulfonamide antibiotics 3 5 ecotoxicity of ktf photoproducts ecosar model has been widely used to evaluate the ecotoxicity of various organic contaminants and their transformation products in the aquatic environment wang et al 2017 in the present study the aquatic ecotoxicity of ktf and its photoproducts including etoh bp etooh bp acbp and etbp were assessed by ecosar results show that the photoproducts have increased acute and chronic toxicity to fish daphnia and green algae relative to their parent compound as shown in table s1 supporting information the ecotoxicity of photoproducts is accelerated to different levels as compared to that of ktf which is consistent with previous studies kotnik et al 2016 wang et al 2017 among them etbp has the highest ecotoxicity to aquatic organisms especially the chronic toxicity to fish and daphnid on the other hand the higher log k ow value of etbp indicates that this photoproduct is more likely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and thus reach a higher level in animals through food chain in addition etbp is also likely to partition to the organic phase of sediments or particulate organic matters thereby avoiding photodegradation while the log k ow value of acbp is identical to that of ktf the photostability of such product vide supra enables it to persist in natural waters thus posing risks to aquatic species the ecotoxicity of etoh bp and etooh bp tend to be weaker than that of etbp and acbp probably because they are more hydrophilic and will likely be excreted through metabolism 4 conclusions and environmental significance exposure of ktf aqueous solution to uv365 irradiation led to rapid dissipation of this drug generating several photoproducts including etoh bp etooh bp acbp and etbp by monophotonic photodecarboxylation 90 and or biphotonic photoionization 10 o2 had no significant impact on the photolysis rate of ktf but was involved in the formation and further conversion of photoproducts the photophysical properties of etbp and acbp were studied by spectroscopic characterization in particular transient absorption spectra obtained by 266 nm lfp showed that etbp and acbp were excited to triplet state with lifetimes of 28 and 2 4 µs respectively the presence of o2 in aerated solution significantly enhanced the decay of these transients further supporting the assignment of the transients to triplet excited states etbp was relatively photolabile giving rise to etoh bp etooh bp and acbp upon uv365 irradiation the photolysis of etbp is proposed to be initiated by the intramolecular h abstraction within the excimer precursor 3 etbp etbp formed between the triplet state 3etbp and the ground state etbp in contrast acbp was comparatively photostable particularly under aerated condition experiments using dmabn as a probe of triplet aromatic ketones showed that both etbp and acbp exhibited strong photosensitizing activity ecosar program suggested that photoproducts are more ecotoxic and biocumulative than ktf to aquatic organisms in summary the rapid photolysis of ktf in aqueous solution leads to the formation of toxic photoproducts with remaining photochemical and photosensitizing activity due to the presence of core bp chromophore therefore our study underscores the need to scrutinize the formation and fate of ktf photoproducts in sunlit surface waters due to their high ecotoxicity and photosensitizing activity credit authorship contribution statement lixiao wang investigation writing original draft yajie zheng methodology

ppcps may have potentially negative and cumulative effects on non target organisms keerthanan et al 2020 therefore the occurrence transformation and fate of ppcps in the aquatic environment have received extensive attention chen et al 2021 ketoprofen 2 3 benzoylphenyl propanoic acid ktf is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid widely prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis spondylitis and pain relief see chart 1 for molecular structure zhou et al 2014 ktf has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment with concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to µg l 1 kosjek et al 2005 while ktf is relatively recalcitrant toward biodegradation photochemical transformation is known to be an important process accounting for the fate of this nsaid in natural sunlit waters szabó et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the photoreactivity of ktf is derived from the benzophenone bp chromophore which can absorb photons under irradiation to generate reactive intermediates such as triplet excited states and free radicals martínez and scaiano 1997 nakajima et al 2005 musa et al 2007 hykrdová et al 2018 in addition due to the high energy and unique electronic configuration of triplet aromatic ketones t1 n π ktf has a strong photosensitizing potential and can cause photohemolysis lipid peroxidation as well as damage to proteins and nucleic acid chains through various mechanisms including electron transfer hydrogen abstraction energy transfer and paternò büchi reactions lhiaubet et al 2001 encinas et al 2004 lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 shinoda et al 2014 kashihara et al 2019 therefore after oral absorption ktf can produce photosensitizing effect on biomolecules resulting in phototoxicity or photoallergy such as cellular photohemolysis lipid peroxidation and nucleic acid chain damage boscá et al 1994 chignell and sik 1998 indeed the photobiological effects of ktf and other bp containing pharmaceuticals have been extensively studied boscá and miranda 1998 consuelo et al 2012 in environmental photochemistry the generation of photoproducts is worthy of particular attention because in some cases photoproducts tend to be more toxic than their parent compounds fatta kassinos et al 2011 indeed the possible production of harmful photoproducts is the dark side of the environmental photochemistry of contaminants vione and carena 2020 a well known example is triclosan tcs an antimicrobial agent widely used in personal care products such as soap and hand sanitizer the exposure of tcs to artificial or solar irradiation has been reported to generate highly toxic 2 8 dichlorodibenzo p dioxin through a 6π electrocyclization reaction initiated by photodehalogenation latch et al 2003 2005 kliegman et al 2013 therefore in order to completely and accurately evaluate the ecological risks of ppcps it is very necessary to study the transformation and fate of their photoproducts in the environment kümmerer 2009 fatta kassinos et al 2011 the ktf molecule features a bp chromophore and a propionic acid ch ch3 cooh side chain the former is an important chromophore enabling ktf to absorb photons to generate excited states or radical species while the latter can facilitate ktf to undergo direct photolysis through photodecarboxylation boscá et al 1994 martínez and scaiano 1997 cosa et al 1999 it has been reported that under neutral and alkaline conditions the ktf carboxylate pk a 4 7 undergoes monophotonic decarboxylation predominantly 90 and to a less extent biphotonic photoionization 10 martínez and scaiano 1997 these processes can trigger the photochemical reactions leading to the formation of benzylic carbanions or radicals martínez and scaiano 1997 musa et al 2007 using nanosecond laser flash photolysis lfp martínez and scaiano 1997 confirmed that the photolysis of ktf could produce 3 ethylbenzophenone etbp and 3 acetylbenzophenone acbp see chart 1 for molecular structures through protonation of a benzylic carbanion or hydrogen abstraction of a benzylic radical studies have shown that these photoproducts conserved the bp structure and as expected could photosensitize the damage of lipids proteins and nucleic acids under irradiation encinas et al 2004 consuelo et al 2012 boscá and miranda 1998 observed that reaction mixtures obtained upon irradiation of ktf in neutral aqueous medium were more toxic to cultured hepatocytes than non irradiated controls evidencing the higher toxicity of oxygenated photoproducts however up to now the photophysical photosensitizing and photochemical behaviors of ktf photoproducts are still largely unknown in natural environment and their ecological risks also warrant further assessment this scenario appears to be particularly urgent considering the fact that ktf can undergo rapid phototransformation in natural surface waters e g river water with a half life of only 4 min lin and reinhar 2005 this article was designed to fill the knowledge gaps associated with the photochemical behavior and photosensitizing potential of ktf photoproducts in the natural aquatic environment to do so we first attempted to identify the photoproducts of ktf

drug i e 85 removal percentage within 10 min fig s1 supporting information the photolysis reaction obeys pseudo first order kinetics and the pseudo first order rate constant k obs is determined to be 0 19 min 1 t 1 2 3 6 min the photolability of ktf observed in this study is consistent with previous reports lin and reinhar 2005 kotnik et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 interestingly the ktf concentration remained almost unchanged during the subsequent reaction time fig s1 possibly due to the competition for absorbing photons between ktf and photoproducts ktf has been known to undergo photolysis either through monophotonic decarboxylation or via biphotonic photoionization martínez and scaiano 1997 cosa et al 1999 the monophotonic decarboxylation is the dominant pathway 90 accounting for the photolysis of ktf carboxylate pk a 4 7 martínez and scaiano 1997 upon irradiation the ktf carboxylate undergoes a rapid decarboxylation within 1 ns or faster from the singlet excited state to yield a carbanion cosa 2004 such carbanion can undergo tautomerization to produce a ketyl biradical thus featuring spectroscopic properties from both a ketyl radical anion and a benzylic radical martínez and scaiano 1997 cosa et al 1999 cosa 2004 in neutral aqueous solution the carbanion with a lifetime of 150 ns undergoes rapid protonation to generate etbp whose photochemistry is less known see fig s2 a supporting information chignell and sik 1998 in the biphotonic photoionization process the ktf carboxylate first absorbs a photon being excited to the singlet state 1ktf which subsequently converts to the triplet excited state 3ktf through a rapid intersystem crossing isc process martínez and scaiano 1997 cosa et al 1999 due to the high molar absorption coefficient of 3ktf it can absorb another photon and then undergo photoionization to generate solvated electrons and ktf radicals nakajima et al 2005 the solvated electron reacts with the o2 in water to generate superoxide radical anion o2 while the ktf radical can undergo rapid decarboxylation to generate a benzylic radical wang et al 2017 the benzylic radical readily couples with o2 or reactive oxygen species ros such as 1o2 and o2 to generate 3 ethyl α hydroxylbenzophenone etoh bp 3 ethyl α hydroperoxylbenzophenone etooh bp and acbp see fig s2 b supporting information hykrdová et al 2018 it should be noted that a small fraction of benzylic radical can also undergo self coupling reactions to generate dimers boscá et al 1994 nakajima et al 2005 our attempt to identify the ktf photoproducts was implemented by concentrating the photolysate with spe followed by lc ms ms and hrms analyses see section 2 5 the structural assignments of ktf photoproducts were based on their retention times uv vis spectra accurate masses and fragmentation patterns of molecular ions as well as comparison with previous studies kosjek et al 2011 a total of four photoproducts were identified including etoh bp etooh bp acbp and etbp fig 1 and fig s3 of supporting information the identification of these photoproducts is in good agreement with previous studies kotnik et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 among these photoproducts etbp and acbp are commercially available therefore their qualification and quantification were further carried out by hplc analyses using authentic standards the formation of etbp and acbp during ktf photolysis was found to be closely related to the amount of o2 in water wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 fig 2 depicts the photodegradation of ktf and the evolution of etbp and acbp under aerated and deaerated conditions as can be seen 85 of ktf was rapidly degraded within 10 min regardless of the presence absence of o2 in the solution this is because ktf mainly undergoes monophotonic decarboxylation in neutral solution with 1ktf as a precursor cosa et al 1999 musa et al 2007 thus the presence of o2 had no significant impact on the photolysis rate of ktf in contrast the formation and conversion of photoproducts are highly dependent on the o2 wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 along with the degradation of ktf etbp was rapidly formed with its concentration reaching the maximum at 10 min under aerated conditions the concentration of etbp decreased slowly with prolonging time and the concentration of acbp increased steadily fig 2a under n2 degassed conditions however the concentration of etbp decreased rapidly after 10 min while the concentration of acbp exhibited a first increasing and then decreasing tendency fig 2b the discrepancy highlights the critical role of o2 in the formation and transformation of ktf photoproducts on the one hand o2 was involved in the formation of ktf photoproducts as evidenced by the continuous increase of acbp observed under aerated condition fig 2a wang et al 2017 reported that o2 favored the phototransformation of etbp to generate acbp through reactions with molecular o2 o2 and other ros on the other hand o2 was not conducive to the further conversion of etbp and acbp fig 2a we speculate that the presence of o2 might quench the triplet excited state through energy transfer thus inhibiting the conversion of etbp into acbp the triplet energy of bp derivatives is known to be 288 kj mol 1 which is high enough to transfer energy to o2 to generate 1o2 94 kj mol 1 mcneill and canonica 2016 3 2 spectroscopic characterization of etbp and acbp 3 2 1 uv vis absorption spectra the photophysical properties of etbp and acbp were characterized by spectroscopic analyses fig 3 displays the uv vis absorption spectra of etbp and acbp in aqueous solutions as can be seen the etbp aqueous solution containing 1 acn shows an obvious absorption band in the range of 230 300 nm with λ max at 260 nm ε max 19 230 m 1 cm 1 the absorption band tails to approximately 320 nm which is similar to the uv vis absorption spectrum of bp in aqueous solution data not shown this broad absorption band is mainly due to the strong conjugation between the benzene rings and the carbonyl group boscá et al 1994 lhiaubet et al 2000 solvatochromic experiment using acn as a solvent further confirmed the π π nature of the absorption band see detailed discussion in text s2 supporting information bp derivatives should also have an n π transition corresponding to an absorption at 360 nm turro et al 2010 however we did not observe the absorption band caused by n π transition likely due to the poor spatial overlap between n and π orbitals which results in weak oscillator strength and therefore negligible absorbance turro et al 2010 the uv vis absorption spectrum of acbp aqueous solution differs slightly from those of etbp and bp fig 3 most notably acbp is featured by a more broader absorption band ranging from 215 to 300 nm the λ max of acbp is located at 236 nm ε max 24 420 m 1 cm 1 and there is a shoulder peak at 260 nm besides the absorption intensity of acbp is greater than those of etbp and bp at the same concentrations these discrepancies are likely due to the fact that the carbonyl group in the acetyl branch of acbp molecule participates in the conjugation of bp moiety through electron delocalization despite these differences the uv vis absorption spectra of etbp and acbp both show a weak absorbance at 300 nm which can be overlapped with terrestrial solar spectrum therefore the photochemical transformation of etbp and acbp is likely to occur in natural sunlit surface waters boreen et al 2003 3 2 2 transient absorption spectra fig 4 describes the nanosecond transient absorption spectra obtained upon 266 nm laser flash photolysis of etbp acbp in nitrogen saturated neutral aqueous solutions as can be seen the transient absorption spectra of etbp show characteristic absorption bands within 300 350 nm λmax 320 and 330 nm and 480 550 nm λmax 525 nm fig 4a analogous to those of triplet ktf and other bp derivatives martínez and scaiano 1997 similar transient absorption spectra were obtained for acbp fig 4b with λmax at 320 and 525 nm which is in satisfactory agreement with triplet triplet bp like absorption turro et al 2010 we therefore assign the characteristic absorption bands to the triplet excited states of etbp acbp the formation of triplet states of bp like derivatives can be rationalized by a very high isc rate constant k isc 1011 1012 s 1 due to the strong spin orbit coupling soc boscá and miranda 1998 the triplets 3etbp and 3acbp decay by first order kinetics with a lifetime of 28 and 2 4 μs respectively in deaerated aqueous solutions with the absorption bands showing the same kintic behavior the presence of o2 in aerated solution significantly enhanced the decay of these transients fig 4 insets this further supports the assignment of the transients to the triplet excited states because triplets can be efficiently quenched by o2 through energy transfer to generate 1o2 mcneill and canonica 2016 quenching rate constants for 3etbp 3acbp and o2 were obtained by stern volmer plots following eq 2 2 k obs k 0 k q o 2 where k 0 is the triplet decay rate constant in the absence of o2 k q is the triplet quenching rate constant in the presence of o2 and o2 is the concentration of o2 based on the plots the rate constants for quenching 3etbp and 3acbp were determined to be 2 9 109 and 2 2 109 m 1s 1 respectively these values are in statisfactory agreement with that of 3bp 2 6 0 1 109 m 1s 1 measured in oxygenated water canonica et al 2000 3 3 photochemistry of etbp and acbp 3 3 1 quantum yields and products the aquatic photochemistry of etbp and acbp was investigated upon uv365 irradiation under both aerated and deaerated conditions fig 5 shows that etbp was photolabile under irradiation and its photolysis followed pseudo first order kinetics in particular deaerated condition was conducive to the photolysis of etbp k obs aerated 0 0037 min 1 vs k obs deaerated 0 015 min 1 the quantum yields of etbp photolysis were determined to be 0 61 and 2 46 mol e 1 respectively under aerated and deaerated conditions three photoproducts i e etoh bp etooh bp and acbp were identified during the photolysis of etbp among them acbp was the major product the generation of these products is closely related to the content of o2 as shown in fig 5a the concentration of acbp raised steadily in aerated solution while the concentration of etoh bp increased to a maximum and remained unchanged in the case of etooh bp its concentration was negligible in deoxygenated solution however the product concentrations exhibited a first increasing and then decreasing pattern in particular acbp etoh bp and etooh bp reached maximum values of 14 9 2 2 and 0 7 μm at 90 20 and 10 min respectively fig 5b the intermediacy of etoh bp and etooh bp concurs with their further transformation to acbp wang et al 2017 hykrdová et al 2018 fig 5a also shows that under aerated condition the etbp photolysis was characterized by a good mass balance this means that etbp was almost completely transformed via oxygen dependent pathway which stoichiometrically generated oxygenated photoproducts acbp etoh bp and etooh bp in contrast the mass balance of the photoproducts was poor under deaerated condition fig 5b this result can be explained by the fact that a fraction of benzylic radicals can self couple through an oxygen independent pathway to form dimers boscá et al 1994 due to the lack of authentic standards we could not quantify the concentrations of dimers further support in favor of the dimer forming pathway comes from the quantum yield obtained in deoxygenated solution 2 46 mol e 1 which is greater than 1 vide supra unlike etbp acbp appeared to be relatively photostable under aerated condition but slightly photolabile under deaerated condition fig s4 of supporting information the quantum yield of acbp in deaerated solution was determined to be 0 085 mol e 1 much lower than that of etbp the photostability of acbp implies the potential persistence of this photoproduct in the aquatic environment bp derivatives are well known 1o2 photosensitizers e g the quantum yield of 1o2 φδ for bp is 0 34 in the present study we investigated the reactivity of etbp acbp with 1o2 that was nonphotochemically generated through moo4 2 catalyzed disproportionation of h2o2 böhme and brauer 1992 the decay of ffa a well known 1o2 probe 1 0 108 m 1s 1 confirms the generation of 1o2 in the moo4 2 h2o2 system felcyn et al 2012 however no measurable degradation of etbp acbp was observed under identical experimental conditions suggesting that etbp acbp has low reactivity with 1o2 fig s5 supporting information 3 3 2 mechanisms for etbp and acbp photolysis the difference in product evolution during etbp photolysis under aerated deaerated conditions is related to its unique photochemistry the photoreactivity of etbp is likely driven by its lowest lying triplet excited state t1 n π which is a characteristic of bp derivatives boscá et al 1994 we speculate that etbp undergoes photochemical degradation through the following pathways r1 etbp hv 1 etbp isc 3 etbp r2 3 etbp etbp 3 etbp etbp r3 3 etbp etbp etbp h etbp h r4 etbp h o 2 acbp other oxygenated products r5 etbp h no o 2 dimers r6 etbp h o 2 etbp ho 2 o 2 under uv irradiation a fraction of etbp molecules is excited to singlet state 1etbp which undergoes fast isc to generate triplet state 3etbp due to efficient soc r1 due to its relatively long lifetime 28 μs 3etbp can encounter with a ground state etbp to form an excimer precursor 3 etbp etbp r2 subsequently intramolecular h abstraction or proton coupled electron transfer pcet occurs within the excimer leading to the formation of a radical pair comprising of a benzylic etbp h and a ketyl radical etbp h r3 similar excimer derived intramolecular electron or hydrogen transfer has previously been proposed for the photochemistry of chlorocarbazole an important photoproduct of the nsaid diclofenac encinas et al 1998 these radicals can escape from the solvent cage forming free radicals which convert to photoproducts via further reactions for example the benzylic radical can further transform either via oxygen dependent or oxygen independent pathways under aerated condition the benzylic radical is dominantly converted to acbp etoh bp and etooh bp by trapping o2 r4 as shown in scheme 1 under deaerated condition however a fraction of benzylic radicals is subjected to self coupling to form dimers through oxygen independent pathways r5 note that a fraction of etbp will be regenerated through elimination of ho2 o2 after coupling with o2 in aerated solution r6 wang et al 2017 unlike etbp acbp had a high photostability under aerated condition fig s4 of supporting information possibly because the presence of o2 quenched the triplet excited state 3acbp thereby inhibiting its photolysis the resistance to photolysis may also be explained by the fact that the branch chain of acbp favors the deactivation of 3acbp via nonradiative relaxation turro et al 2010 under deaerated condition a weak photodegradation of acbp was found possibly through norrish i reaction as typically observed in bp derivatives the norrish i reaction of acbp should produce acyl and alkyl diradical intermediates via bond cleavage α cleavage however the possibility of α cleavage reaction is determined by thermodynamics turro et al 2010 owning to the large bond energy of α c c o the excited acbp molecule is unlikely to undergo an efficient α cleavage reaction at room temperature for example the rate constant of α cleavage reaction k cl is expected to be 102 s 1 for bp acetone and propiophenone which is much lower than that of k ts 103 s 1 rate constant for isc process t1 s0 turro et al 2010 therefore α cleavage is not expected to be efficient for the photolysis of acbp 3 4 photosensitizing potential of etbp and acbp triplet aromatic ketones have strong photosensitizing activity due to their unique electronic configuration and relatively high energy mcneill and canonica 2016 the identified ktf photoproducts conserve the bp chromophore thus are expected to have photosensitizing ability under irradiation in this study we used dmabn as a molecular probe to evaluate the photosensitizing activity of etbp acbp triplet dmabn has been known to react with the triplet aromatic ketones through a single electron transfer mechanism to generate aminyl radicals or radical cations which are subjected to sequential n demethylation to produce mabn and abn see chart 1 for molecular structures leresche et al 2016 2019 the underlying mechanisms for the reaction between dmabn and triplet aromatic ketones are detailed in text s3 supporting information exposure of 15 µm dmabn aqueous solution ph 7 0 phosphate buffered to uv365 irradiation showed no measurable decay within 5 h indicating that the triplet probe was resistant to direct photolysis fig 6 a leresche et al 2016 in the presence of 10 µm etbp however an appreciable attenuation of dmabn was observed within 2 5 h fig 6b similar result was obtained when 10 µm acbp was spiked into dmabn solution as a photosensitizer fig s6 supporting information leresche et al 2016 suggested that the fractional contribution of 1o2 to the transformation of dmabn photosensitized by fulvic acid 5 mgc l 1 was lower than 5 the maximum second order rate constant for the reaction of dmabn and 1o2 was estimated to be 1 9 107 m 1s 1 leresche et al 2016 therefore the rapid degradation of dmabn highlights the sensitizing ability of ktf photoproducts upon uv365 irradiation the photosensitization of ktf photoproducts is most likely derived from their triplet excited state as evidenced by lfp studies fig 4 as expected the sensitized photolysis of dmabn generated mabn and abn sequentially r7 leresche et al 2016 the time dependent evolution of mabn and abn can be well fitted by the following sequential reaction kinetic models eqs 3 and 4 r7 dmabn k 1 mabn k 2 abn 3 mabn k 1 dmabn 0 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t 4 abn dmabn 0 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t k 1 k 2 k 1 e k 2 t where k 1 and k 2 represent the pseudo first order formation and degradation rate constants of mabn respectively this constitutes further support in favor of the electronic configuration of the lowest lying 3etbp 3acbp as t1 n π it is well known that n π excitation of the carbonyl compounds produces an alkoxy radical like excited state in which the electron deficiency at the oxygen induces typical radical reactivity in the molecule bhasikuttan et al 1998 it is worth noting that the concentration of acbp remained unchanged during the reaction on the contrary the concentration of etbp decreased steadily during the sensitized photolysis of dmabn data not shown therefore we speculate that acbp has a persistent photosensitizing ability while etbp may sensitize dmabn at the early stage as the reaction progressed it was the photoproducts i e acbp etoh bp and etooh bp rather than etbp per se that sensitized the photolysis of dmabn overall our results indicate that the ktf photoproducts possess photosensitizing ability due to the bp chromophore which is consistent with previous studies chignell and sik 1998 wang and wan 2015 upon solar irradiation these substances may sensitize the damage of biomolecules such as lipids proteins or nucleic acids in particular these photoproducts are also likely to sensitize the photolysis of electron rich contaminants such as anilines e g sulfonamide antibiotics and phenolics e g 17β estradiol in sunlit surface waters wenk and canonica 2012 canonica et al 2000 work is ongoing in our laboratory to investigate the photosensitizing effects of ktf photoproducts on the transformation of sulfonamide antibiotics 3 5 ecotoxicity of ktf photoproducts ecosar model has been widely used to evaluate the ecotoxicity of various organic contaminants and their transformation products in the aquatic environment wang et al 2017 in the present study the aquatic ecotoxicity of ktf and its photoproducts including etoh bp etooh bp acbp and etbp were assessed by ecosar results show that the photoproducts have increased acute and chronic toxicity to fish daphnia and green algae relative to their parent compound as shown in table s1 supporting information the ecotoxicity of photoproducts is accelerated to different levels as compared to that of ktf which is consistent with previous studies kotnik et al 2016 wang et al 2017 among them etbp has the highest ecotoxicity to aquatic organisms especially the chronic toxicity to fish and daphnid on the other hand the higher log k ow value of etbp indicates that this photoproduct is more likely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and thus reach a higher level in animals through food chain in addition etbp is also likely to partition to the organic phase of sediments or particulate organic matters thereby avoiding photodegradation while the log k ow value of acbp is identical to that of ktf the photostability of such product vide supra enables it to persist in natural waters thus posing risks to aquatic species the ecotoxicity of etoh bp and etooh bp tend to be weaker than that of etbp and acbp probably because they are more hydrophilic and will likely be excreted through metabolism 4 conclusions and environmental significance exposure of ktf aqueous solution to uv365 irradiation led to rapid dissipation of this drug generating several photoproducts including etoh bp etooh bp acbp and etbp by monophotonic photodecarboxylation 90 and or biphotonic photoionization 10 o2 had no significant impact on the photolysis rate of ktf but was involved in the formation and further conversion of photoproducts the photophysical properties of etbp and acbp were studied by spectroscopic characterization in particular transient absorption spectra obtained by 266 nm lfp showed that etbp and acbp were excited to triplet state with lifetimes of 28 and 2 4 µs respectively the presence of o2 in aerated solution significantly enhanced the decay of these transients further supporting the assignment of the transients to triplet excited states etbp was relatively photolabile giving rise to etoh bp etooh bp and acbp upon uv365 irradiation the photolysis of etbp is proposed to be initiated by the intramolecular h abstraction within the excimer precursor 3 etbp etbp formed between the triplet state 3etbp and the ground state etbp in contrast acbp was comparatively photostable particularly under aerated condition experiments using dmabn as a probe of triplet aromatic ketones showed that both etbp and acbp exhibited strong photosensitizing activity ecosar program suggested that photoproducts are more ecotoxic and biocumulative than ktf to aquatic organisms in summary the rapid photolysis of ktf in aqueous solution leads to the formation of toxic photoproducts with remaining photochemical and photosensitizing activity due to the presence of core bp chromophore therefore our study underscores the need to scrutinize the formation and fate of ktf photoproducts in sunlit surface waters due to their high ecotoxicity and photosensitizing activity credit authorship contribution statement lixiao wang investigation writing original draft yajie zheng methodology

contaminated sites and landfill leachates reveal complex cycling within the natural and engineered environment analysis of 171 contaminated sites in michigan by source release indicate four dominant pfas sources landfills aqueous film forming foams afff metal platers and automotive metal stamping account for 75 of the contamination diverse chemical signatures were observed for leachates collected from 19 landfills mostly type ii municipal with the dominant pfas ranging from perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos to shorter chained compounds perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluorobutanoic acid pfba and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs analysis of pfas carbon chain length as a function of landfill age shows the transition of c8s in leachate from older landfills to c4s and c6s in younger landfills consistent with the phasing out and replacement of c8s pfas mass flux in leachate for landfills studied range between 5 2 000 g yr and are highest for active landfills which generate greater leachate volumes and contain fresh pfas wastes detailed study of 10 wwtps with industrial pretreatment programs indicate numerous chemical transformations across the plants that yield effluent pfas concentrations as much as 19 times greater than influent attributed to transformations of unmeasured precursors in the influent to measured stable pfas in the effluent pfoa pfhxa perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea pfba and pfbs show the greatest increases across the plant ranging from 20 to nearly 2 000 pfos concentrations decreased across 6 wwtps consistent with a strong tendency to adsorb onto biosolids estimated mass of discharge of mostly unregulated pfas from wwtps to receiving waters range from 40 g yr to 128 kg yr graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words biosolids chemical transformations emerging contaminants leachate mass flux 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas is a broad term for over 5000 manmade aliphatic compounds with at least one carbon fluorine c f bond buck et al 2011 hamid et al 2018 itrc 2018 polyfluoroalkyl substances fluorotelomers and other polymers breakdown in the environment to form perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas which are highly resistant to further degradation sulfonated perfluorochemicals in the environment 2000 o hagan 2008 usepa 2008 hamid et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the stability of pfaas most notably perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa has earned pfas the moniker forever chemicals miner et al 2021 prevedouros et al 2006 some pfas cause adverse health impacts at ng l levels accumulate in humans and animals primarily through ingestion chou et al 2019 de silva et al 2021 kennedy et al 2004 shin et al 2011 sunderland et al 2019 trudel et al 2008 and bioaccumulate conder et al 2008 martin et al 2004 pfas are surfactants with excellent water grease and stain resistant properties and high resistance to thermal degradation that have made them widely produced and used in industrial commercial military and firefighting applications chou et al 2019 houtz et al 2013 kotthoff et al 2015 pfas have been mass produced since the 1940s dean et al 2020 and are now detected in the remotest areas on earth butt et al 2011 miner et al 2021 they are released to the environment via waste disposal landfill leachate residuals from wastewater treatment plants wwtps use of aqueous film forming foams afff e g at airports military bases refineries tank farms fire stations and direct release from industry due to environmental concerns production and use of long chain 8 carbons pfas in north america europe and australia was voluntarily halted in the early 2000s and replaced with shorter chain pfas buck et al 2011 dean et al 2020 for example perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs c4 was a replacement for pfos c8 usepa 2020 recent studies indicate that short chain pfas replacements are also persistent and can have adverse health and environmental effects cousins et al 2016 kotlarz et al 2020 scheringer et al 2014 in this study pfas with eight or more carbons are considered long chain and pfas with less than eight are considered short chain short chained pfas have a lower tendency to sorb and bioaccumulate and are more mobile in the environment than c8 compounds buck et al 2011 chow et al 2021 the persistence of pfas leads to complex cycling in the atmosphere biosphere geosphere and hydrosphere fig 1 depicts the life cycle and shows the movement of pfas in natural and engineered systems proper management of pfas requires understanding their cycling between systems and quantifying their mass flux and transformation mechanisms pfas used in different applications have unique compositions that are distinguishable in wwtps and landfills receiving wastes from these sources and these signatures changed after the transition to shorter chained pfas benskin et al 2012 hamid et al 2018 lang et al 2017 technologies to remove pfas from drinking water leachate and groundwater collect and concentrate rather than destroy pfas e g activated carbon reverse osmosis the treatment residuals e g spent carbon reverse osmosis concentrate must be disposed of in landfills or other engineered systems which are becoming increasingly important pfas repositories allred et al 2015 hamid et al 2018 robey et al 2020 mass flux of pfas between some compartments in fig 1 will therefore increase monitoring is necessary to quantify mass flux of pfas between compartments and tracking pfas signatures is critical to identifying sources of contamination in addition to treatment residuals landfills receive pfas from biosolids and activated sludge from wwtps soils and sludges from contaminated sites industrial wastes and consumer products gallen et al 2018 lang et al 2016 mahinroosta et al 2020 ross et al 2018 pfas leach readily and enter the hydrosphere in older unlined landfills hepburn et al 2019 but are collected in modern landfills and are treated onsite or discharged to wwtps hamid et al 2018 renou et al 2008 wwtps do not foster reactions that break the c f bond making them a major contributor of pfas to surface waters ahrens et al 2009 sinclair and kannan 2006 lenka et al 2021 compiled and reviewed data on the occurrence transformation and removal of pfas in over 500 wwtps in 20 countries in 4 continents many of these wwtps reported lower influent than effluent pfas concentrations and attributed this to the transformation of polyfluorinated precursors to pfaas across the plant a conclusion supported by other studies guerra et al 2014 hamid et al 2018 houtz et al 2013 pfas also accumulate in activated sludge and biosolids lenka et al 2021 lindstrom et al 2011 sepulvado et al 2011 and

sites landfill leachate and wwtps due to proactive regulatory standards michigan has developed one of the most complete pfas datasets available for this purpose several studies have provided in depth reviews of pfas for a subset of wwtps and landfills e g benskin et al 2012 hamid et al 2018 lang et al 2017 liu et al 2021 robey et al 2020 lenka et al 2021 this is the first study seeking to integrate pfas cycling within contaminated sites landfills and wwtps from a statewide perspective trends in carbon chain length mass loading wastewater composition and percent differences across wwtps are defined and quantified using a 28 analyte pfas suite two industrially impacted wwtps with multiple sampling dates are used to study chemical transformations during treatment 2 methods all pfas data from landfill leachate contaminated sites and influent effluent and biosolids from wwtps within michigan were compiled from publicly available and private sources only datasets containing the 28 analyte suite generated by pfas certified laboratories using a modified form of the usepa 537 rev 1 1 537 1 shoemaker 2018 or astm d7979 astm 2017a analytical methods were used in our study a data sharing agreement was formed between western michigan university and mi egle the miwaters database which contains public records from all wwtps within michigan were also used to obtain data for several landfills and wwtps data were obtained directly from the operators landfill leachate volumes were derived from the michigan waste and recycling association report mwra 2019 and correspondence with egle personnel leachate volumes are not reported and precluded the quantification of mass flux for three of the studied landfills state disposal landfill rjl landfill and north kent landfill a total of 10 industrially impacted wwtps and 19 landfills within michigan were investigated due to pfas being an emerging contaminant only recent 2018 2020 sampling dates were available a majority of the landfills are type ii municipal solid waste landfills with two exceptions 1 georgia pacific charleston landfill located in climax michigan is an inactive legacy type i landfill that accepted paper waste from nearby paper mills and 2 allen park clay mine landfill originated as a clay mine for brick and cement applications until ford motor company converted it to a type i landfill for disposal of automotive waste the site has since been redeveloped into a 1 million square foot retail center all wwtps analyzed are industrially impacted have elevated pfas concentrations and accept wastewater generated by communities up to 2 8 million customers the kalamazoo water reclamation plant kwrp is the only facility in michigan that actively treats for pfas using powder activated carbon publicly accessible biosolids data were difficult to obtain as only a small subset of wwtps reported sampling on miwaters while many others did not report any biosolids data all sampling was conducted in compliance with the state issued general pfas sampling guidance document containing detailed procedures to collect and handle pfas samples improve sampling quality and consistency and prevent cross contamination mdeq 2018 items such as low density polyethylene ldpe bottles teflon tubing and fluorinated ethylene propylene labware and clothing items with resistance to water oil stains insect or uv light were prohibited during collection and or analysis of pfas samples mdeq 2018 field and equipment blanks were used to demonstrate either the lack of or identify cross contamination the usepa has only recently announced details on a validated a method utilizing liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and isotope dilution to analyze pfas in matrices other than drinking water in september of 2021 this method was not available during the analysis of the collected samples used in this study usepa method 537 1 analyzes for 18 compounds in drinking water only using solid phase extraction lc ms ms shoemaker 2018 at the time of this study michigan required 28 compounds to be tested table 1 which is not possible with usepa method 537 1 to analyze for 28 compounds pfas certified laboratories contracted by the state use what is referred to as 537 modified which utilizes lc ms ms isotope dilution and the inclusion of additional standards to expand the analyte suite the 537 modified method is not an approved method for drinking water analysis by the usepa each participating analytical laboratory has developed their own proprietary standard operating procedure and determines the quality control parameters and all other modifications which may result in variations between laboratories the 537 modified method has been used statewide to analyze pfas in various nondrinking water matrices including biota landfill leachate wwtp influent effluent and biosolids similar to astm d7968 astm 2017b an extraction with a proprietary methanol solvent solution followed by filtration and lc ms ms analysis for 537 modified analytes was performed for all biosolid samples the data used in this study was accepted without any further quality checks relying on internal quality assurance and quality control from the participating pfas certified laboratories a subset of pfas data associated with leachate from landfills discharging into the glwa wwtp utilized astm d7979 17 this method excludes 9 pfas included in the 537 modified 4 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 4 2 fts 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 6 2 fts 8 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 8 2 fts perfluoro 2

pfoda and perfluorotetradecanoic acid pfta these pfas are denoted with an asterisk in table 1 the impact of using astm d7979 17 for a subset of landfills was assessed by computing the sum of the concentration of these 9 compounds as a percentage of total pfas for all leachate samples analyzed using 537 modified the analysis indicated only minor contributions to total pfas ranging from non

decreasing chain length as described in table 1 3 1 contaminated sites michigan is one of the leading states in the nation in testing public and private water sources to reduce human exposure to pfas in 2016 usepa issued a drinking water health advisory limit for pfoa pfos at 70 ng l hamid et al 2018 this is the limit that michigan used until august of 2020 when new mcls for drinking water were promulgated for seven compounds pfbs 420 ng l perfluorohexanesulfonic acid pfhxs 51 ng l pfhxa 400 000 ng l pfos 16 ng l pfoa 8 ng l perfluorononanoic acid pfna 6 ng l hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da gen x 370 ng l table 1 egle 2020b groundwater samples exceeding any of these mcls will result in a contaminated site designation in michigan the decrease from 70 ng l pfoa pfos to 8 ng l pfoa and 16 ng l pfos increased the number of contaminated sites in the state the mpart website listed a total of 171 pfas contaminated sites in michigan on 7 7 2021 four major sources account for 75 of the contaminated sites legacy landfills 37 afff used for fire suppression at military bases and airports 18 metal platers that utilize pfas as mist suppressants using compounds such as chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids cl pfesas also known as f 53b and pfos liu et al 2019 12 and automotive metal stamping 8 figure s1 the remaining sources are unspecified manufacturing including

for waterproofing leather 1 and dry cleaners and laundromats 1 groundwater plumes are poorly delineated for the vast majority 95 of the contaminated sites in the state and combined with the lack of data on mass released precluded ranking sites on the basis of source mass instead we use the maximum reported concentration of pfoa pfos to better understand the relative magnitudes of contamination encountered at each of the 171 sites and group the sites into 7 arbitrary bins 70 70 100 100 500 500 2000 2000 10 000 10 000 100 000 and greater than 100 000 ng l figure s2 maximum concentration data could not be obtained from 22 sites and these sites are depicted in the unknown category and excluded from the analysis approximately 80 of pfas contaminated sites in michigan have maximum concentrations under 2000 ng l the largest group of 43 sites 25 have maximum concentrations less than 70 ng l and were added in response to michigan promulgating 8 ng l pfoa and 16 ng l pfos mcls a total of 11 sites 6 narrowly exceed the previous usepa health advisory limit of 70 ng l as grouped in the 70 100 ng l bin the 100 500 ng l and 500 2000 bins contain 30 sites 18 and 33 sites 19 respectively the 2000 10 000 ng l and 10 000 100 000 ng l bins contain 12 sites 7 and 15 sites 9 respectively only 5 sites 3 have maximum concentrations exceeding 100 000 ng l trends of maximum concentration by source type yield two interesting trends afff sites on average have substantially higher concentrations with 43 of the afff sites having pfoa pfos exceeding 10 000 ng l and approximately half of the sites contaminated by legacy landfills have maximum concentrations of 70 ng l or less 3 2 landfills a total of 19 landfills were analyzed in this study and were selected primarily based on availability of data a total of 11 of the sites are type ii municipal landfills the remaining eight are designated as type i construction waste landfills or are of unknown classification ten landfills in this study are inactive and nine are currently active table 2 lists details on each landfill including dates of operation location status and total pfas concentrations leachate volumes vary from 8 m3 d at the georgia pacific landfill to 368 m3 d at the city of pontiac landfill table 2 a clear distinction in leachate volume is observed from the operational status of the landfills active vs inactive total pfas annual mass flux is calculated as the product of leachate volume and concentration table 2 figure s3 pfas mass flux for active landfills 86 to 1998 g yr are generally 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than inactive landfills 5 to 41 g yr this can be attributed to cap placement upon landfill closure to reduce the infiltration of precipitation and reduce leachate volume lang et al 2017 representative leachate chemistry expressed as percent composition is used to characterize the presence and dominance of individual pfas compounds for each landfill fig 2 eagle valley georgia pacific south macomb and southeast oakland county landfills were excluded from fig 2 due to size constraints total pfas leachate concentration is displayed at the top of each bar and ranges from 208 23 458 ng l temporal variability in total pfas concentrations is moderate with coefficients of variation ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 for landfills with at least 9 sampling datasets landfills are located on the horizontal axis according to the dominant pfas compound with decreasing carbon chain length from the left to right to simplify the display of the full 28 analyte suite the vertical placement of pfas for each landfill is ordered in decreasing chain length from bottom to top consistent with table 1 avoiding use of similar colors for some compounds in a 28 analyte suite is impractical but the color scheme does not assign similar colors for pfas with similar carbon chain lengths in an effort to facilitate comparisons between leachate composition and relative abundance of different pfas chain length only seven 37 of the landfills analyzed in this study generated leachate with pfoa or pfos as the dominant pfas this is particularly interesting as michigan landfill operators are only required to regulate these two pfas leachate from cork street mds2 north kent and woodland meadows van buren landfills is pfoa dominant and allen park cork street mds rjl south macomb and state disposal landfill is pfos dominant cork street mds and mds2 are two different outfalls connected to two isolated cells in the same closed landfill leachate from six 32 of the landfills city of pontiac georgia pacific menominee northern oaks smiths creek and woodland meadows north is pfhxa c6 dominant four 21 of the landfills collier oakland heights southeastern oakland

and c8 normalized by total pfas are also analyzed by carbon chain length as a function of operational start date fig 3 a the trends denote a shift from long chain to short chain compounds where c8s decrease with operational age to c4 and c6 compounds the older landfills such as cork street allen park state disposal and south macomb county have c8 compositions ranging from 59 to 85 the c4 and c6 compositions for these landfills are minimal and range from 0 to 19 starting in the 1970s with north kent and oakland heights landfills a large decline is observed in c8 composition landfills created after 1980 have fluctuating chain length compositions yet in all cases the compositions of c4 and c6 increase with landfill operational date an unnamed per operator request midsize municipal landfill in michigan provided pfas leachate data sampled from 2018 to 2020 for 9 individual cells with waste composition dating from as early as the 1980s possibly before to current that allow for more in depth analysis of carbon chain length as a function of age of the waste fig 3b several dates of operation were approximated by the landfill operator as the exact dates are unknown the compositions of c4 c6 and c8 pfas are based on sample averages overall the fig 3b plot shows similar trends to fig 3a with the older cells having higher compositions of long chain c8 compounds and lower compositions of short chained compounds the newer cells generally exhibit increases in c4 and c6 replacements and decreases in c8 compounds mh a2 is one of two outfalls for cell a the oldest cell for which adequate data could be obtained the start date of the cell is not known but it was closed in 1989 the compositions are 49 26 and 10 for c8 c6 and c4 respectively cells 5 6 2b 3a and 3b have operational dates ranging from 1997 to 2016 and have relatively similar c8 compositions ranging from 19 25 c6 compositions ranging from 27 39 and c4 compositions ranging from 17 31 cell 7 operational

less than 10 c6 ranges from 36 44 and c4 ranges from 21 38 an inverse relationship between c4 and c6 where higher c6 compositions are accompanied by lower c4 compositions and vice versa is observed in fig 3 limited field studies have been conducted on pfas in landfill environments with most studies focusing on laboratory tests performed at the bench scale allred et al 2015 lang et al 2016 the increase of shorter chain compounds in leachate can be attributed to the industry shift towards short chain alternatives as well as the higher mobility of short chain pfas benskin et al 2012 higgins and luthy 2006 long chain compounds are more likely to sorb to soil and organic matter whereas short chain pfas have a lower binding capacity gagliano et al 2020 this could explain why long chain compounds are still being leached from landfill waste although production and usage have stopped it is also possible that pfoa and pfos may be present in imported consumer goods from other countries where it is still in use vermont department of environmental conservation july 2018 found that active landfills generate leachate with total pfas on the order of 25 000 ng l total pfas using a 29 analyte suite which is comparable to total pfas in leachate for the active landfills in this study 1777 23 458 ng l younger landfills generate c4 and c6 dominant leachate that tends to be higher in total pfas 621 23 458 ng l than leachate from older long chain dominant landfills 208 4495 ng l these concentration differences could be attributed to inferior performance of short chain pfas in consumer goods requiring higher amounts to be used scheringer et al 2014 landfills do not typically treat pfas on site but instead discharge leachate to nearby wwtps in fact most of the landfill leachate data used in this study were obtained from wwtp operator data collected from influent wastewater landfills contribute less than 10 of the total pfoa and pfos mass loadings to wwtps in michigan mwra 2019 however pfoa and pfos represent only a subset of pfas in leachate the 28 pfas analytical suite currently used in michigan does not account for thousands of potential compounds that may be present in leachate even with limited analyte suites mass loading of total pfas in leachate can be substantial lang et al 2017 estimated that in 2013 total mass loading from landfills in the u s ranged from 563 to 628 kg yr using a 70 pfas analytical suite a more recent study in florida analyzed pfas in waste vehicles and landfill leachates and determined that polyfluorinated precursors transformed to pfaas while in the landfill liu et al 2021 3 3 wastewater treatment plants ten industrially impacted wwtps within michigan were investigated using datasets from 2018 to 2020 table 3 in 2018 michigan started the industrial pretreatment program ipp pfas initiative requiring all industrial contributors to municipal wwtps with ipps n 95 to be identified and screened for pfas egle 2020a source reduction efforts are mandated for wastewaters above 70 ng l pfoa pfos and may include replacing pfoa and pfos with shorter chained pfas installing pretreatment systems for industrial wastewater and treating captured water from contaminated sites undergoing active remediation these source reduction measures have now brought all of the wwtps in this study into environmental compliance however michigan surface water discharge regulations solely focus on maximum concentrations of either 12 ng l pfoa pfos or 11 ng l pfoa pfos if surface water is used as a drinking water source and disregard all other compounds in addition to industrial wastewaters 27 wwtps in michigan accept leachate from at least one landfill mwra 2019 the largest wwtp in the state glwa accepts leachate from nine different landfills 3 3 1 wwtp influent and effluent the format and organization of pfas composition plots for wwtp influent and effluent are the same as used for landfill leachate including colors assigned to individual compounds fig 4 shows the influent percent composition of the ten wwtps analyzed in this study total pfas concentrations of the 28 analyte suite are listed at the top of each column and range from 17 314 ng l five 50 of the wwtps bronson downriver north kent lapeer and ki sawyer are dominated by pfos in the influent wastewater while none of the wwtps are pfoa dominant two 20 of the wwtps kwrp and port huron are pfhxa c6 dominant another two 20 of the wwtps glwa and grand rapids have substantial concentrations of 6 2 fts c6 in the influent quite dissimilar to the other wwtps which have only minor concentrations of this polyfluorinated precursor approximately 80 of the influent to grand rapids is made up of 6 2 fts one 10 of the wwtps three rivers has pfbs c4 dominant influent although pfhxa c6 comprises approximately 25 representative effluent compositions for these same wwtps are provided in fig 5 total pfas concentrations for the 28 analyte suite are substantially higher in the effluent than the influent for all the wwtps studied ranging from 81 to 1357 ng l grand rapids showed the largest increase a factor of 4 3 with an influent concentration of total pfas of 314 ng l and an effluent concentration of 1357 ng l effluent concentrations of three wwtps bronson downriver ki sawyer are pfos dominant compared to the five wwtps bronson downriver ki sawyer lapeer north kent with pfos dominant influent glwa and grand rapids effluent compositions remain 6 2 fts dominant where concentrations of 6 2 fts increased across the plant from 30 43 ng l and 250 1200 ng l respectively figs 4 and 5 port huron wwtp effluent is pfhxs dominant kalamazoo lapeer and north kent have perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea c5 dominant effluent which is quite remarkable as none of these wwtps had more than 13 pfpea in the influent pfbs is the dominant pfas in both the influent and effluent of the three rivers wwtp our observations of higher effluent pfas concentrations are consistent with other studies lenka et al 2021 nguyen et al 2019 sinclair and kannan 2006 which can be attributed to precursors being transformed to pfaas across the plant glwa and kwrp were selected for more in depth analysis of pfas transformations in wwtps glwa is the state s largest wwtp serving over 2 8 million residents and wastewater contributors in southeast michigan kwrp serves over 150 000 residents and wastewater contributors in southwest michigan and is the only wwtp in michigan that uses powdered activated carbon pac in its treatment process pac adsorbs pfas but is added to this plant to remove a variety of organic compounds discharged to the plant without pretreatment by a local pharmaceutical manufacturer total pfas for the 28 analyte suite in the influent and effluent for kwrp and glwa are listed in table 3 and illustrated in figure s4 multiple samples from the same month were averaged to compute daily concentration values total pfas in the kwrp influent ranges from 9 to 87 ng l total pfas whereas effluent ranges from 25 to 133 ng l the only date when the average daily influent for kwrp is greater than the effluent is september of 2018 with daily influent and effluent concentrations of 87 and 74 ng l respectively all other effluent daily total pfas concentrations for kwrp are greater in the influent than the effluent by a factor of 1 2 to 12 for glwa total pfas in the influent ranges from 18 to 174 ng l compared with 107 219 ng l in the effluent effluent concentrations are greater than influent by a factor of 1 1 to 1 6 save october 15 2020 and november 12 2020 when influent concentrations are slightly greater than effluent transformations between the influent and effluent waste streams are analyzed for all 28 analytes using percent difference plots the calculations are performed such that higher concentrations in the effluent are positive net gain and negative percent differences indicate higher concentrations in the influent than effluent net loss the percent difference plots are restricted to the pfas with the greatest changes across the plant 6 pfas pfoa pfos pfhxa pfpea pfba and pfbs for kwrp and 7 pfas pfoa pfos pfhxa 6 2 fts pfpea pfba and pfbs for glwa all these pfas are pfaas except for 6 2 fts which is a polyfluorinated precursor several of the 28 pfas are excluded from the plot due to lack of appreciable change from influent to effluent one of these is pfna which was also found not to change substantially in a previous study analyzing seven pfas in six danish wwtps bossi et al 2008 fig 6 shows a plot of percent difference for kwrp pfoa c8 shows net gains from influent to effluent with only one date indicating a net loss trends for pfos c8 are mixed with multiple positive and negative and frequently near zero percent differences perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa c7 generally shows net losses across the plant not shown large net gains were observed for pfhxa c6 for nearly every sampling date the highest percent difference for pfhxa c6 is a remarkable 1686 increase pfpea c5 also undergoes large net gains for every sampling date with a 57 to 1900 increase from influent to effluent pfba and pfbs both increase across the plant but much less than pfhxa c6 and pfpea c5 percent differences for pfba and pfbs both c4 range from 0 to 344 and 98 to 479 respectively percent differences for glwa are shown in fig 7 pfoa and pfos both show several negative and positive percent differences with pfos trends generally indicating an overall net loss across the plant effluent concentrations for pfhxa are greater than influent with increases ranging from 48 to 167 concentrations of pfhxs indicate a net loss across the plant for every sample date except on april 7 2020 with percent differences from 5 to 29 results for polyfluorinated 6 2 fts were mixed with positive differences from 37 to 408 and negative differences from 14 to 60 concentrations of pfba and pfbs both c4 generally increase from influent to effluent pfba net gains ranged from 5 to 64 with two samples indicating net losses of 9 and 25 pfbs ranged from zero percent difference from influent to effluent to as high as 115 and one sampling date with a value of 36 annual total pfas mass loading rates for the 10 wwtps are estimated from concentration data of the 28 analyte suite and wwtp discharge data from miwaters table 3 figure s5 ki sawyer and bronson wwtps both have the lowest mass loading rates to receiving waters approximately 0 04 kg yr grand rapids and glwa wwtps have the greatest total pfas mass loading rates to receiving waters approximately 63 kg yr and 128 kg yr respectively bossi et al 2008 reported mass loading from danish industrial wwtps using a seven pfas suite ranging from 10 g yr 147 g yr with an average of 96 g yr this estimate is only comparable to the loading values of 40 g yr from both the ki sawyer and bronson wwtp and is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the average of our loading estimates of 21 kg yr this discrepancy could be due to bossi et al 2008 only using only 7 analytes compared to 28 analytes used in this study all estimated wwtp loading rates are large considering pfas regulations for drinking water are in the ng l range it should be noted that 21 of the 28 75 of pfas in the 28 analyte suite used in this study are terminal pfaas but a substantial mass of unmeasured pfas are discharged into receiving waters 3 3 2 wwtp biosolids although activated sludge accumulates pfas fewer samples have been analyzed for pfas at fewer michigan wwtps than for influent and effluent nonetheless pfas composition plots were also made for 11 samples of biosolids from six wwtps bronson downriver glwa ki sawyer menominee and three rivers and are shown in fig 8 except for menominee all these wwtps are included in our characterization of pfas in influent and effluent in section 3 1 1 concentrations of total pfas are located at the top of each column and range from 18 to 7017 ng g dry weight dw biosolids from bronson wwtp n 4 and ki sawyer n 3 show remarkable variability greater than two orders of magnitude and total pfas concentrations from 56 to 7017 ng g dw and from 93 to 4530 ng g dw respectively one dataset was obtained for downriver glwa and three rivers with total pfas concentrations of 46 18 and 626 ng g dw respectively the composition of pfas in these biosolids skew heavily towards long chain pfas with the dominant pfas being c8 or larger and only a very minor contribution of short chained pfas fig 8 pfos is the dominant compound in 8 of 11 or 73 of the samples due to its strong tendency to sorb to organics the dominant pfas in the other three samples was perfluorodecanesulfonic acid pfds c10 pfoa c8 and nmefosaa c8 the bronson wwtp had a total of four biosolids samples three of which are pfos dominant and contained very little pfds and one anomalous pfds dominant sample that contained no pfoa or pfos a single biosolids sample from the three rivers wwtp is only slightly pfoa dominant 33 with the pfhxa c6 comprising 32 of the total pfas one biosolids sample from the menominee wwtp was dominant in nmefosaa which was only detected in biosolids from one other wwtp bronson insufficient pfas analyses of biosolids precluded 1 estimation of annual pfas mass loading of biosolids and 2 determination of whether net losses of pfos and other compounds in wwtp influent can be attributed to sorption onto biosolids this is an outstanding area in the quantification of the pfas cycle that needs considerably more research e g winchell et al 2021 however it is well established that biosolids are a sink for in wwtps lenka et al 2021 lindstrom et al 2011 sepulvado et al 2011 which explains consistent observations of a net loss of pfos across michigan wwtps while shorter chain pfas tended to increase longer chain pfas have a greater tendency than shorter chain pfas to sorb onto biosolids which support the hypothesis that short chain pfas in landfills in michigan originate from sources other than biosolids bossi et al 2008 found that perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas with an even number of carbon atoms were more abundant in biosolids which is consistent with even carbon numbered pfas c8 and c10 being the most abundant in michigan biosolids in our study biosolids and effluent pfos concentrations ranged from 4 to 6500 ng g dw and 1 200 ng l respectively loganathan et al 2007 also found that samples of biosolids had higher concentrations of pfos 43 993 ng g dw than wastewater samples 8 1 47 ng l 4 conclusions pfas exhibit complex cycling behavior between natural and engineered systems in the environment a statewide assessment of pfas in michigan was performed to 1 determine ranges of maximum concentrations and major sources of pfas release to the environment and 2 characterize trends in pfas contaminated wastewaters including pfas composition carbon chain length transformations during residence in wwtps and annual mass flux from landfills and wwtps trends in pfas in biosolids with respect to wwtp influent and effluent composition were also evaluated a synthesis of our results yields ten primary study findings legacy landfills dominate the list of michigan pfas contaminated sites only a small subset of which has been investigated for pfas contamination industrial impacted wwtps comprise only 4 of michigan s pfas contaminated sites yet actively discharge mass flux of pfas according to a 28 analyte suite most of which are unregulated ranging from 40 g yr to 128 kg yr to receiving surface waters despite the recent promulgation of 7 pfas with mcls for drinking water pfoa and or pfos are responsible for all contaminated site designations in michigan leachates collected from 19 landfills mostly type ii municipal have diverse chemical signatures but are dominated by pfoa pfos pfhxa pfba or pfbs leachate from younger landfills tend to have higher composition of short chain pfas than older landfills due to industrial shifts in pfas usage and short chain pfas having higher solubility and lower sorptivity leachate is a major pfas contributor to wwtps with mass flux ranging between 5 2000 g yr for the landfills studied though unable to break the c f bond in pfas municipal wwtps effectively transform polyfluorinated precursors to measured pfaas causing effluent concentrations of total pfas to be as much as 19 times greater than influent pfoa pfhxa pfpea pfba and pfbs show the greatest net increases across wwtps ranging from 20 to nearly 2000 for the two wwtps studied having the most complete datasets while several pfas showed net increases in concentration across wwtps pfos consistently exhibited net decreases due to sorption onto biosolids and municipal wwtp generated biosolids are dominated by long chain pfas despite michigan s best effort in characterizing the extent of pfas contamination within the state and large expenditures on testing for pfas in various liquid and solid matrices and developing regulatory standards for drinking water and surface water discharge it is not possible to quantify any component of the pfas cycle at the state level or provide reliable estimates of fluxes between these components this is not limited to michigan and is reflective of both the state of pfas knowledge and current regulatory practices the 537 modified 28 analyte suite used in michigan provides greater resolution in pfas trends composition and mass flux than other standardized methods for wastewater currently provide however analytical methods that broaden the list of analytes to include commercially used pfas e g buck et al 2021 are urgently needed to provide more comprehensive quantification of pfas and better characterization of pfas composition chemical transformations and mass flux from landfills and wwtps the inclusion of more pfas particularly polyfluorinated precursors could change the dominant pfas compositions identified in this study for landfill leachate wwtp influent and effluent and perhaps even biosolids expanded pfas analyte suites to quantify a diverse array of polyfluorinated precursors would also greatly benefit the study of chemical transformations in wwtps for example pfpea exhibited the greatest increases during residence in kwrp most likely due to the breakdown and transformation of undetected polyfluorinated c5 percursor s in the influent waste stream more accurate mass balances between wwtp influent effluent and biosolids are required to reconcile transformations across the plant and to quantify mass loading of landfilled and land applied sewage sludges and biosolids finally the annual mass loading estimates provided by this study of mostly unregulated pfas from wwtp effluent to receiving waters are substantial and require further scrutiny data archive https github com dmreeves1 wr pfas declaration of competing

production and use of long chain 8 carbons pfas in north america europe and australia was voluntarily halted in the early 2000s and replaced with shorter chain pfas buck et al 2011 dean et al 2020 for example perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs c4 was a replacement for pfos c8 usepa 2020 recent studies indicate that short chain pfas replacements are also persistent and can have adverse health and environmental effects cousins et al 2016 kotlarz et al 2020 scheringer et al 2014 in this study pfas with eight or more carbons are considered long chain and pfas with less than eight are considered short chain short chained pfas have a lower tendency to sorb and bioaccumulate and are more mobile in the environment than c8 compounds buck et al 2011 chow et al 2021 the persistence of pfas leads to complex cycling in the atmosphere biosphere geosphere and hydrosphere fig 1 depicts the life cycle and shows the movement of pfas in natural and engineered systems proper management of pfas requires understanding their cycling between systems and quantifying their mass flux and transformation mechanisms pfas used in different applications have unique compositions that are distinguishable in wwtps

continents many of these wwtps reported lower influent than effluent pfas concentrations and attributed this to the transformation of polyfluorinated precursors to pfaas across the plant a conclusion supported by other studies guerra et al 2014 hamid et al 2018 houtz et al 2013 pfas also accumulate in activated sludge and biosolids lenka et al 2021 lindstrom et al 2011 sepulvado et al 2011 and

are defined and quantified using a 28 analyte pfas suite two industrially impacted wwtps with multiple sampling dates are used to study chemical transformations during treatment 2 methods all pfas data from landfill leachate contaminated sites and influent effluent and biosolids from wwtps within michigan were compiled from publicly available and private sources only datasets containing the 28 analyte suite generated by pfas certified laboratories using a modified form of the usepa 537 rev 1 1 537 1 shoemaker 2018 or astm d7979 astm 2017a analytical methods were used in our study a data sharing agreement was formed between western michigan university and mi egle the miwaters database which contains public records from all wwtps within michigan were also used to obtain data for several landfills and wwtps data were obtained directly from the operators landfill leachate volumes were derived from the michigan waste and recycling association report mwra 2019 and correspondence

total of 10 industrially impacted wwtps and 19 landfills within michigan were investigated due to pfas being an emerging contaminant only recent 2018 2020 sampling dates were available a majority of the landfills are type ii municipal solid waste landfills with two exceptions 1 georgia pacific charleston landfill located in climax michigan is an inactive legacy type i landfill that accepted paper waste from nearby paper mills and 2 allen park clay mine landfill originated as a clay mine for brick and cement applications until ford motor company converted it to a type i landfill for disposal of automotive waste the site has since been redeveloped into a 1 million square foot retail center all wwtps analyzed are industrially impacted have elevated pfas concentrations and accept wastewater generated by communities up to 2 8 million customers the kalamazoo water reclamation plant kwrp is the only facility in michigan that actively treats for pfas using powder activated carbon publicly accessible biosolids data were difficult to obtain as only a small subset of wwtps reported sampling on miwaters while many others did not report any biosolids data all sampling was conducted in compliance with the state issued general pfas sampling guidance document containing detailed procedures to collect and handle pfas samples improve sampling quality and consistency and prevent cross contamination mdeq 2018 items such as low density polyethylene ldpe bottles teflon tubing and fluorinated ethylene propylene labware and clothing items with resistance to water oil stains insect or uv light were prohibited during collection and or analysis of pfas samples mdeq 2018 field and equipment blanks were used to demonstrate either the lack of or identify cross contamination the usepa has only recently announced details on a validated a method utilizing liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and isotope dilution to analyze pfas in matrices other than drinking water in

certified laboratories contracted by the state use what is referred to as 537 modified which utilizes lc ms ms isotope dilution and the inclusion of additional standards to expand the analyte suite the 537 modified method is not an approved method for drinking water analysis by the usepa each participating analytical laboratory has developed their own proprietary standard operating procedure and determines the quality control parameters and all other modifications which may result in variations between laboratories the 537 modified method has been used statewide to analyze pfas in various nondrinking water matrices including biota landfill leachate wwtp influent effluent and biosolids similar to astm d7968 astm 2017b an extraction with a proprietary methanol solvent solution followed by filtration and lc ms ms analysis for 537 modified analytes was performed for all biosolid samples the data used in this study was accepted without any further quality checks relying on internal

decreasing chain length as described in table 1 3 1 contaminated sites michigan is one of the leading states in the nation in testing public and private water sources to reduce human exposure to pfas in 2016 usepa issued a drinking water health advisory limit for pfoa pfos at 70 ng l hamid et al 2018 this is the limit that michigan used until august of 2020 when new mcls for drinking water were

respectively the 2000 10 000 ng l and 10 000 100 000 ng l bins contain 12 sites 7 and 15 sites 9 respectively only 5 sites 3 have maximum concentrations exceeding 100 000 ng l trends of maximum concentration by source type yield two interesting trends afff sites on average have substantially higher concentrations with 43 of the afff sites having pfoa pfos exceeding 10 000 ng l and approximately half of the sites contaminated by legacy landfills have maximum concentrations of 70 ng l or less 3 2 landfills a total of 19 landfills were analyzed in this study and were selected primarily based on availability of data a total of 11 of the sites are type ii municipal landfills the remaining eight are designated as type i construction waste landfills or are of unknown classification ten landfills in this study are inactive and nine are currently active table 2 lists details on each landfill including dates of operation location status and total pfas concentrations leachate volumes vary from 8 m3 d at the georgia pacific landfill to 368 m3 d at the city of pontiac landfill table 2 a clear distinction in leachate volume is observed from the operational status of the landfills active vs inactive total pfas annual mass flux is calculated as the product of leachate volume and concentration table 2 figure s3 pfas mass flux for active landfills 86 to 1998 g yr are generally 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than inactive landfills 5 to 41 g yr this can be attributed to cap placement upon landfill closure to reduce the infiltration of precipitation and reduce leachate volume lang et al 2017 representative leachate chemistry expressed as percent composition is used to characterize the presence and dominance of individual pfas compounds for each landfill fig 2 eagle valley georgia pacific south macomb and southeast oakland county landfills were excluded from fig 2 due to size constraints total pfas leachate concentration is displayed at the top of each bar and ranges from 208 23 458 ng l temporal variability in total pfas concentrations is moderate with coefficients of variation ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 for landfills with at least 9 sampling datasets landfills are located on the horizontal axis according to the dominant pfas compound with decreasing carbon chain length from the left to right to simplify the display of the full 28 analyte suite the vertical placement of pfas for each landfill is ordered in decreasing chain length from bottom to top consistent with table 1 avoiding use of similar colors for some compounds in a 28 analyte suite is impractical but the color scheme does not assign similar colors for pfas with similar carbon chain lengths in an effort to facilitate comparisons between leachate composition and relative abundance of different pfas chain length only seven 37 of the landfills analyzed in this study generated leachate with pfoa or pfos as the dominant pfas this is particularly interesting as michigan landfill operators are only required to regulate these two pfas leachate from cork street mds2 north kent and woodland meadows van buren landfills is pfoa dominant and allen park cork street mds rjl south macomb and state disposal landfill is pfos dominant cork street mds and mds2 are two different outfalls connected to two isolated cells in the same closed landfill leachate from six 32 of the landfills city of pontiac georgia pacific menominee northern oaks smiths creek and woodland meadows north is pfhxa c6 dominant four 21 of the landfills collier oakland heights southeastern oakland county and waterford hills generated pfba c4 dominant leachate and two 10 of the landfills eagle valley and pinetree acres generated pfbs c4 dominant leachate leachate pfas composition as total c4 c6 and c8 normalized by total pfas are also analyzed by carbon chain length as a function of operational start date fig 3 a the trends denote a shift from long chain to short chain compounds where c8s decrease with operational age to c4 and c6 compounds the older landfills such as cork street allen park state disposal and south macomb county have c8 compositions ranging from 59 to 85 the c4 and c6 compositions for these landfills are minimal and range from 0 to 19 starting in the 1970s with north kent and oakland heights landfills a large decline is observed in c8 composition landfills created after 1980 have fluctuating chain length compositions yet in all cases the compositions of c4 and c6 increase with landfill operational date an unnamed per operator request midsize municipal landfill in michigan provided pfas leachate data sampled from 2018 to 2020 for 9 individual cells with waste composition dating from as early as the 1980s possibly before to current that allow for more in depth analysis of carbon chain length as a function of age of the waste fig 3b several dates of operation were approximated by the landfill operator as the exact dates are unknown the compositions of c4 c6 and c8 pfas are based on sample averages overall the fig 3b plot shows similar trends to fig 3a with the older cells having higher compositions of long chain c8 compounds and lower compositions of short chained compounds the newer cells generally exhibit increases in c4 and c6 replacements and decreases in c8 compounds mh a2 is one of two outfalls for cell a the oldest cell for which adequate data could be obtained the start date of the cell is not known but it was closed in 1989 the compositions are 49 26 and 10 for c8 c6 and c4 respectively cells 5 6 2b 3a and 3b have operational dates ranging from 1997 to 2016 and have relatively similar c8 compositions ranging from 19 25 c6 compositions ranging from 27 39 and c4 compositions ranging from 17 31 cell 7 operational from 2011 to 2015 exhibits a substantial decrease in c8 and increase in c6 compared to cell 3b cells 4 and 8 operated from 2016 to 2020 respectively and have pfas compositions similar to cell 7 c8 is less than 10 c6 ranges from 36 44 and c4 ranges from 21 38 an inverse relationship between c4 and c6 where higher c6 compositions are accompanied by lower c4 compositions and vice versa is observed in fig 3 limited field studies have been conducted on pfas in landfill environments with most studies focusing on laboratory tests performed at the bench scale allred et al 2015 lang et al 2016 the increase of shorter chain compounds in leachate can be attributed to the industry shift towards short chain alternatives as well as the higher mobility of short chain pfas benskin et al 2012 higgins and luthy 2006 long chain compounds are more likely to sorb to soil and organic matter whereas short chain pfas have a lower binding capacity gagliano et al 2020 this could explain why long chain compounds are still being leached from landfill waste although production and usage have stopped it is also possible that pfoa and pfos may be present in imported consumer goods from other countries where it is still in use vermont department of environmental conservation july 2018 found that active landfills generate leachate with total pfas on the order of 25 000 ng l total pfas using a 29 analyte suite which is comparable to total pfas in leachate for the active landfills in this study 1777 23 458 ng l younger landfills generate c4 and c6 dominant leachate that tends to be higher in total pfas 621 23 458 ng l than leachate from older long chain dominant landfills 208 4495 ng l these concentration differences could be attributed to inferior performance of short chain pfas in consumer goods requiring higher amounts to be used scheringer et al 2014 landfills do not typically treat pfas on site but instead discharge leachate to nearby wwtps in fact most of the landfill leachate data used in this study were obtained from wwtp operator data collected from influent wastewater landfills contribute less than 10 of the total pfoa and pfos mass loadings to wwtps in michigan mwra 2019 however pfoa and pfos represent only a subset of pfas in leachate the 28 pfas analytical suite currently used in michigan does not account for thousands of potential compounds that may be present in leachate even with limited analyte suites mass loading of total pfas in leachate can be substantial lang et al 2017 estimated that in 2013 total mass loading from landfills in the u s ranged from 563 to 628 kg yr using a 70 pfas analytical suite a more recent study in florida analyzed pfas in waste vehicles and landfill leachates and determined that polyfluorinated precursors transformed to pfaas while in the landfill liu et al 2021 3 3 wastewater treatment plants ten industrially impacted wwtps within michigan were investigated using datasets from 2018 to 2020 table 3 in 2018 michigan started the industrial pretreatment program ipp pfas initiative requiring all industrial contributors to municipal wwtps with ipps n 95 to be identified and screened for pfas egle 2020a source reduction efforts are mandated for wastewaters above 70 ng l pfoa pfos and may include replacing pfoa and pfos with shorter chained pfas installing pretreatment systems for industrial wastewater and treating captured water from contaminated sites undergoing active remediation these source reduction measures have now brought all of the wwtps in this study into environmental compliance however michigan surface water discharge regulations solely focus on maximum concentrations of either 12 ng l pfoa pfos or 11 ng l pfoa pfos if surface water is used as a drinking water source and disregard all other compounds in addition to industrial wastewaters 27 wwtps in michigan accept leachate from at least one landfill mwra 2019 the largest wwtp in the state glwa accepts leachate from nine different landfills 3 3 1 wwtp influent and effluent the format and organization of pfas composition plots for wwtp influent and effluent are the same as used for landfill leachate including colors assigned to individual compounds fig 4 shows the influent percent composition of the ten wwtps analyzed in this study total pfas concentrations of the 28 analyte suite are listed at the top of each column and range from 17 314 ng l five 50 of the wwtps bronson downriver north kent lapeer and ki sawyer are dominated by pfos in the influent wastewater while none of the wwtps are pfoa dominant two 20 of the wwtps kwrp and port huron are pfhxa c6 dominant another two 20 of the wwtps glwa and grand rapids have substantial concentrations of 6 2 fts c6 in the influent quite dissimilar to the other wwtps which have only minor concentrations of this polyfluorinated precursor approximately 80 of the influent to grand rapids is made up of 6 2 fts one 10 of the wwtps three rivers has pfbs c4 dominant influent although pfhxa c6 comprises approximately 25 representative effluent compositions for these same wwtps are provided in fig 5 total pfas concentrations for the 28 analyte suite are substantially higher in the effluent than the influent for all the wwtps studied ranging from 81 to 1357 ng l grand rapids showed the largest increase a factor of 4 3 with an influent concentration of total pfas of 314 ng l and an effluent concentration of 1357 ng l effluent concentrations of three wwtps bronson downriver ki sawyer are pfos dominant compared to the five wwtps bronson downriver ki sawyer lapeer north kent with pfos dominant influent glwa and grand rapids effluent compositions remain 6 2 fts dominant where concentrations of 6 2 fts increased across the plant from 30 43 ng l and 250 1200 ng l respectively figs 4 and 5 port huron wwtp effluent is pfhxs dominant kalamazoo lapeer and north kent have perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea c5 dominant effluent which is quite remarkable as none of these wwtps had more than 13 pfpea in the influent pfbs is the dominant pfas in both the influent and effluent of the three rivers wwtp our observations of higher effluent pfas concentrations are consistent with other studies lenka et al 2021 nguyen et al 2019 sinclair and kannan 2006 which can be attributed to precursors being transformed to pfaas across the plant glwa and kwrp were selected for more in depth analysis of pfas transformations in wwtps glwa is the state s largest wwtp serving over 2 8 million residents and wastewater contributors in southeast michigan kwrp serves over 150 000 residents and wastewater contributors in southwest michigan and is the only wwtp in michigan that uses powdered activated carbon pac in its treatment process pac adsorbs pfas but is added to this plant to remove a variety of organic compounds discharged to the plant without pretreatment by a local pharmaceutical manufacturer total pfas for the 28 analyte suite in the influent and effluent for kwrp and glwa are listed in table 3 and illustrated in figure s4 multiple samples from the same month were averaged to compute daily concentration values total pfas in the kwrp influent ranges from 9 to 87 ng l total pfas whereas effluent ranges from 25 to 133 ng l the only date when the average daily influent for kwrp is greater than the effluent is september of 2018 with daily influent and effluent concentrations of 87 and 74 ng l respectively all other effluent daily total pfas concentrations for kwrp are greater in the influent than the effluent by a factor of 1 2 to 12 for glwa total pfas in the influent ranges from 18 to 174 ng l compared with 107 219 ng l in the effluent effluent concentrations are greater than influent by a factor of 1 1 to 1 6 save october 15 2020 and november 12 2020 when influent concentrations are slightly greater than effluent transformations between the influent and effluent waste streams are analyzed for all 28 analytes using percent difference plots the calculations are performed such that higher concentrations in the effluent are positive net gain and negative percent differences indicate higher concentrations in the influent than effluent net loss the percent difference plots are restricted to the pfas with the greatest changes across the plant 6 pfas pfoa pfos pfhxa pfpea pfba and pfbs for kwrp and 7 pfas pfoa pfos pfhxa 6 2 fts pfpea pfba and pfbs for glwa all these pfas are pfaas except for 6 2 fts which is a polyfluorinated precursor several of the 28 pfas are excluded from the plot due to lack of appreciable change from influent to effluent one of these is pfna which was also found not to change substantially in a previous study analyzing seven pfas in six danish wwtps bossi et al 2008 fig 6 shows a plot of percent difference for kwrp pfoa c8 shows net gains from influent to effluent with only one date indicating a net loss trends for pfos c8 are mixed with multiple positive and negative and frequently near zero percent differences perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa c7 generally shows net losses across the plant not shown large net gains were observed for pfhxa c6 for nearly every sampling date the highest percent difference for pfhxa c6 is a remarkable 1686 increase pfpea c5 also undergoes large net gains for every sampling date with a 57 to 1900 increase from influent to effluent pfba and pfbs both increase across the plant but much less than pfhxa c6 and pfpea c5 percent differences for pfba and pfbs both c4 range from 0 to 344 and 98 to 479 respectively percent differences for glwa are shown in fig 7 pfoa and pfos both show several negative and positive percent differences with pfos trends generally indicating an overall net loss across the plant effluent concentrations for pfhxa are greater than influent with increases ranging from 48 to 167 concentrations of pfhxs indicate a net loss across the plant for every sample date except on april 7 2020 with percent differences from 5 to 29 results for polyfluorinated 6 2 fts were mixed with positive differences from 37 to 408 and negative differences from 14 to 60 concentrations of pfba and pfbs both c4 generally increase from influent to effluent pfba net gains ranged from 5 to 64 with two samples indicating net losses of 9 and 25 pfbs ranged from zero percent difference from influent to effluent to as high as 115 and one sampling date with a value of 36 annual total pfas mass loading rates for the 10 wwtps are estimated from concentration data of the 28 analyte suite and wwtp discharge data from miwaters table 3 figure s5 ki sawyer and bronson wwtps both have the lowest mass loading rates to receiving waters approximately 0 04 kg yr grand rapids and glwa wwtps have the greatest total pfas mass loading rates to receiving waters approximately 63 kg yr and 128 kg yr respectively bossi et al 2008 reported mass loading from danish industrial wwtps using a seven pfas suite ranging from 10 g yr 147 g yr with an average of 96 g yr this estimate is only comparable to the loading values of 40 g yr from both the ki sawyer and bronson wwtp and is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the average of our loading estimates of 21 kg yr this discrepancy could be due to bossi et al 2008 only using only 7 analytes compared to 28 analytes used in this study all estimated wwtp loading rates are large considering pfas regulations for drinking water are in the ng l range it should be noted that 21 of the 28 75 of pfas in the 28 analyte suite used in this study are terminal pfaas but a substantial mass of unmeasured pfas are discharged into receiving waters 3 3 2 wwtp biosolids although activated sludge accumulates pfas fewer samples have been analyzed for pfas at fewer michigan wwtps than for influent and effluent nonetheless pfas composition plots were also made for 11 samples of biosolids from six wwtps bronson downriver glwa ki sawyer menominee and three rivers and are shown in fig 8 except for menominee all these wwtps are included in our characterization of pfas in influent and effluent in section 3 1 1 concentrations of total pfas are located at the top of each column and range from 18 to 7017 ng g dry weight dw biosolids from bronson wwtp n 4 and ki sawyer n 3 show remarkable variability greater than two orders of magnitude and total pfas concentrations from 56 to 7017 ng g dw and from 93 to 4530 ng g dw respectively one dataset was obtained for downriver glwa and three rivers with total pfas concentrations of 46 18 and 626 ng g dw respectively the composition of pfas in these biosolids skew heavily towards long chain pfas with the dominant pfas being c8 or larger and only a very minor contribution of short chained pfas fig 8 pfos is the dominant compound in 8 of 11 or 73 of the samples due to its strong tendency to sorb to organics the dominant pfas in the other three samples was perfluorodecanesulfonic acid pfds c10 pfoa c8 and nmefosaa c8 the bronson wwtp had a total of four biosolids samples three of which are pfos dominant and contained very little pfds and one anomalous pfds dominant sample that contained no pfoa or pfos a single biosolids sample from the three rivers wwtp is only slightly pfoa dominant 33 with the pfhxa c6 comprising 32 of the total pfas one biosolids sample from the menominee wwtp was dominant in nmefosaa which was only detected in biosolids from one other wwtp bronson insufficient pfas analyses of biosolids precluded 1 estimation of annual pfas mass loading of biosolids and 2 determination of whether net losses of pfos and other compounds in wwtp influent can be attributed to sorption onto biosolids this is an outstanding area in the quantification of the pfas cycle that needs considerably more research e g winchell et al 2021 however it is well established that biosolids are a sink for in wwtps lenka et al 2021 lindstrom et al 2011 sepulvado et al 2011 which explains consistent observations of a net loss of pfos across michigan wwtps while shorter chain pfas tended to increase longer chain pfas have a greater tendency than shorter chain pfas to sorb onto biosolids which support the hypothesis that short chain pfas in landfills in michigan originate from sources other than biosolids bossi et al 2008 found that perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas with an even number of carbon atoms were more abundant in biosolids which is consistent with even carbon numbered pfas c8 and c10 being the most abundant in michigan biosolids in our study biosolids and effluent pfos concentrations ranged from 4 to 6500 ng g dw and 1 200 ng l respectively loganathan et al 2007 also found that samples of biosolids had higher concentrations of pfos 43 993 ng g dw than wastewater samples 8 1 47 ng l 4 conclusions pfas exhibit complex cycling behavior between natural and engineered systems in the environment a statewide assessment of pfas in michigan was performed to 1 determine ranges of maximum concentrations and major sources of pfas release to the environment and 2 characterize trends in pfas contaminated wastewaters including pfas composition carbon chain length transformations during residence in wwtps and annual mass flux from landfills and wwtps trends in pfas in biosolids with respect to wwtp influent and effluent composition were also evaluated a synthesis of our results yields ten primary study findings legacy landfills dominate the list of michigan pfas contaminated sites only a small subset of which has been investigated for pfas contamination industrial impacted wwtps comprise only 4 of michigan s pfas contaminated sites yet actively discharge mass flux of pfas according to a 28 analyte suite most of which are unregulated ranging from 40 g yr to 128 kg yr to receiving surface waters despite the recent promulgation of 7 pfas with mcls for drinking water pfoa and or pfos are responsible for all contaminated site designations in michigan leachates collected from 19 landfills mostly type ii municipal have diverse chemical signatures but are dominated by pfoa pfos pfhxa pfba or pfbs leachate from younger landfills tend to have higher composition of short chain pfas than older landfills due to industrial shifts in pfas usage and short chain pfas having higher solubility and lower sorptivity leachate is a major pfas contributor to wwtps with mass flux ranging between 5 2000 g yr for the landfills studied though unable to break the c f bond in pfas municipal wwtps effectively transform polyfluorinated precursors to measured pfaas causing effluent concentrations of total pfas to be as much as 19 times greater than influent pfoa pfhxa pfpea pfba and pfbs show the greatest net increases across wwtps ranging from 20 to nearly 2000 for the two wwtps studied having the most complete datasets while several pfas showed net increases in concentration across wwtps pfos consistently exhibited net decreases due to sorption onto biosolids and municipal wwtp generated biosolids are dominated by long chain pfas despite michigan s best effort in characterizing the extent of pfas contamination within the state and large expenditures on testing for pfas in various liquid and solid matrices and developing regulatory standards for drinking water and surface water discharge it is not possible to quantify any component of the pfas cycle at the state level or provide reliable estimates of fluxes between these components this is not limited to michigan and is reflective of both the state of pfas knowledge and current regulatory practices the 537 modified 28 analyte suite used in michigan provides greater resolution in pfas trends composition and mass flux than other standardized methods for wastewater currently provide however analytical methods that broaden the list of analytes to include commercially used pfas e g buck et al 2021 are urgently needed to provide more comprehensive quantification of pfas and better characterization of pfas composition chemical transformations and mass flux from landfills and wwtps the inclusion of more pfas particularly polyfluorinated precursors could change the dominant pfas compositions identified in this study for landfill leachate wwtp influent and effluent and perhaps even biosolids expanded pfas analyte suites to quantify a diverse array of polyfluorinated precursors would also greatly benefit the study of chemical transformations in wwtps for example pfpea exhibited the greatest increases during residence in kwrp most likely due to the breakdown and transformation of undetected polyfluorinated c5 percursor s in the influent waste stream more accurate mass balances between wwtp influent effluent and biosolids are required to reconcile transformations across the plant and to quantify mass loading of landfilled and land applied sewage sludges and biosolids finally the annual mass loading estimates provided by this study of mostly unregulated pfas from wwtp effluent to receiving waters are substantial and require further scrutiny data archive https github com dmreeves1 wr pfas declaration of competing

16349,an innovative electro fenton enhanced membrane photobioreactor with satisfactory membrane fouling mitigation was constructed for microalgae harvesting the porous carbon and carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes pc chfms were used as the separation unit and cathode simultaneously h2o2 was generated by cathode reducing o2 in situ which would further produce oh as the main oxidant by coupling h2o2 with fe2 the oh could deeply remove the extracellular organic matter eom deposited on the membrane surface or inside the pores experimental results showed that the permeate flux recovery rates of pc chfms by electro fenton at the 18th 29th and 41st day were 100 100 and 98 3 respectively the corresponding recovery rates by chemical cleaning at the same time were 99 8 81 7 and 54 4 the stable and high permeate flux of pc chfms made a great contribution to the microalgae harvesting efficiency where the concentration factor could be 4 8 times higher than that of the control group filtrating superiority of pc chfms was becoming more prominent with the extension of operating time in addition the removal efficiency of nh4 n and tp in wastewater was approximately 100 at stable culture period graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords porous carbon electro fenton oh microalgae harvesting membrane fouling 1 introduction recently microalgae have been well recognized as a potential alternative source of biofuel and high valued products including biodiesel biomethane bioethanol biohydrogen and biobutanol etc chisti 2007 rawat et al 2011 they are able to provide up to 25 of the global required energy christenson and sims 2011 rawat et al 2011 also it plays a critical role in wastewater bioremediation and co2 sequestration pires et al 2013 razzak et al 2013 however microalgae broth generally requires some procedures such as cultivation harvesting up concentration and dewatering before entering next processing for further utilization at present parts of high value products from microalgae including food supplements natural pigments and polyunsaturated fatty acids are only produced by a limited scale system raja et al 2008 due to the small size typically a few micrometers and low concentration 0 5 2 g l in the culture medium of microalgae therefore an efficient and economical means to harvest microalgae biomass will be an important challenge to promote their full scale application greenwell et al 2010 nowadays energy intensive up centrifugation is widely adopted by most existing microalgae production systems which takes a major proportion of the total energy demand of the production process grima et al 2003 also the method of flotation has the same drawback like up centrifugation rawat et al 2011 singh and patidar 2018 other current microalgae harvesting methods including gravity precipitation and flocculation suffered from the characteristics of low efficiency and environmental unfriendliness rawat et al 2011 singh and patidar 2018 actually it is very common to combine two or more of these technologies to achieve a great separation efficiency and save the energy membrane separation process continuous or intermittent mode with a cheaper cost than up centrifugation method is known as a very promising technology for microalgae harvesting during this process chemicals coagulants or flocculants are not needed which can prevent the hazardous substances accumulating inside the biomass or the recycled streams vandamme et al 2011 also membrane separation with the characteristic of almost complete retention of biomass compared to other harvesting methods owns a good microalgae quality mouchet and bonnelye 1998 because the microalgae cells are less disrupted without chemicals adding into the microalgae broth wicaksana et al 2012 mechanisms of membrane separation potentially have disinfection effect via removal of protozoa and viruses judd 2006 currently several types of membranes including polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polyacrylonitrile polyether sulfone and polytetra fluoroethylene polyethersulfone polyvinyl pyrollidone polyvinyl choloride membranes de baerdemaeker et al 2013 drexler and yeh 2014 have been researched for harvesting microalgae but their applications were hindered by low permeate flux and rapid membrane fouling milledge and heaven 2013 in microalgae harvesting process microalgae cells and extracellular organic matter eom including polysaccharides proteins and humic acids etc are recognized as the main contaminants for membrane fouling zhao et al 2015 during the filtrating microalgae and eom will be loosely deposited on the membranes and form reversible fouling at first which can be easily removed by physical means chiou et al 2010 qu et al 2012b with the advancing of the filtration process irreversible fouling will occur when pollutants are tightly compacted on the membrane surface or deeply blocked the pores qu et al 2012b zhao et al 2017 which generally needs chemical methods to mitigate however the chemicals will not only corrode the membrane materials but also remain harmful impurities to the system and environment meanwhile still part of unrecoverable membrane fouling still exists therefore seeking for environmentally friendly and high efficient membrane fouling alleviation means mainly an efficacious eom removal method is essential previous studies have verified that the electrochemical effect can make a great contribution on membrane fouling mitigation during the microalgae harvesting process because the microalgae and most composition of eom are negatively charged kim et al 2014 mushtaq et al 2019 electrochemical repulsion effect can repel charged microalgae and eom electrochemical oxidation can well remove the pollutants deeply in the membrane pores meanwhile the conductive membranes under bias exhibit electrophoresis electroosmotic leakage electromigration and other electric and transistor phenomenon which also help to improve the membrane separation performance however the membrane fouling alleviation performance is limited by the level of applied bias in previous studies the applied bias was generally distributed in 3 68 v to 30 v which increased the energy consumption for the whole systems kim et al 2014 mushtaq et al 2019 thus it is attractive to take advantage of electrochemistry under a low energy consumption conditions metal organic framework derived porous carbon pc with massive micropores high specific surface area and abundant active sites is known as a superior electro catalytic material which is in favor of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 generation yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 pc blending with fe2 can in situ further generate oh which has a strong oxidation ability for pollutants degradation wang et al 2013 it can be inferred that pc provides a new types of membrane materials to practice energy saved microalgae harvesting strategy herein the pc and carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membrane loaded with fe2 referred to pc chfms was used as cathode and separation unit simultaneously to construct the integrated electro fenton enhanced membrane photobioreactor for microalgae cultivation and harvesting oh was used as a membrane fouling removal reagent the comprehensive performance of membrane fouling mitigation ability was evaluated during the whole operation also the wastewater treatment and microalgae harvesting efficiency were further discussed in this study 2 experimental 2 1 e mpbr setup and operation two parallel laboratory scale membrane photobioreactors with the working volume of 280 ml were built up at 25 0 5 c in an illuminated incubator for wastewater treatment microalgae cultivation and microalgae enrichment fig 1 the light dark cycle was set as 8 h 8 h with the light intensity of 36 w m2 at the light phase among them electro enhanced membrane photobioreactor e mpbr with the pc chfms and fe2 121 1 mg g membrane was used as separation and cathode simultaneously in experimental group the titanium mesh was used as anode the membrane photobioreactor with traditional pvdf hollow fiber membranes pvdf hfms was set as control group the total effective area was 14 6 cm2 the oh produced on electro enhanced pc chfms with fe2 was recorded by esr spectrum of using dmpo trapping agent fig s1 other prosperities of the membranes were presented on the table s1 coelastrum with initial inoculation amount of 100 mg l was cultivated with sterilized bg11 medium without gas supplying and harvested by membrane filtration the influent of the reactors was simulated urban secondary effluent the specific components were shown in table s2 c n p 80 10 1 during the 1st day to the 6th day c n p 150 10 1 from the 7th day to the 53rd day the reasons were exhibited in the supporting information and fig s2 the ph 9 10 in the reactor is maintained within the optimum range for the growth of microalgae fig s3 4 the reactors were operated in batch mode with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 96 h each cycle time was 720 min with 5 min for water inflow 595 min for reaction 120 min for discharging the water output through the membranes was 35 ml for each time the 1 g l of the microalgae concentration was used as threshold for conducting the microalgae recovery the membranes would be cleaned at the same time followed by putting them into the next experiment cycle the total cycles of the microalgae cultivation were determined by performance of the membranes meanwhile during the operation the membranes will be cleaned once the tmp reached 0 6 bar the pc chfms were cleaned by electro fenton with the 1 0 v bias applied on the membranes and the pvdf hfms were cleaned by soaking in 400 ppm sodium hypochlorite the optimum cleaning time for the two types of polluted membranes was determined by the recovery level of pure water permeate flux as shown in fig s5 45 min and 75 min were used for polluted pc chfms and pvdf hfms recovery respectively 2 2 membrane fouling assessment membrane fouling was assessed by transmembrane pressure tmp variation sem images were used to provide intuitive membrane fouling level after operation after hydraulic cleaning and chemical cleaning electro fenton recovery the eom compositions and concentration on membranes were analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fl4500 hitachi japan also the pure water permeate flux recovery rates of membranes would be calculated after cleaning to revel the membrane anti fouling performance 2 3 evaluation of microalgae growth the variations of microalgae biomass chlorophyll a chla and chlorophyll b chlb during the whole operation were detected to reflect the growth of microalgae among them the microalgae biomass concentration was evaluated by the optical density of the microalgae solution at wavelength of 690 nm od690 by a uv spectrophotometer uv 6100 mapada china the chlorophyll was also determined by uv spectrophotometer uv 6100 mapada china briefly take 5 ml of microalgae liquid from the reactor and filter it by a 0 22 μm mixed fiber filter membrane put the microalgae with the mixed fiber filter membrane into 5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and keep it at 70 c for 5 min the supernatant was collected by centrifuge 10 000 rpm 5 min then absorbance of the supernatant at 650 nm od650 and 666 nm od666 were measure by spectrophotometer chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b concentration were calculated according to the following formula c c h l a m g l 13 34 o d 666 4 85 o d 650 c c h l b m g l 24 58 o d 650 6 65 o d 666 2 4 reactor performance analysis nh4 n and p removal efficiency were used to investigate the wastewater treatment performance of the mpbr and e mpbr the nh4 n and p were measured by national standard classical analytical method nessler s reagent spectrophotometry hj 535 2009 and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry gb 11 893 89 respectively the removal rate e was calculated as follows e c f c p c f where cf and cp were the pollutants concentration in influent and in effluent respectively 2 5 microalgae harvesting the microalgae were harvested by the method of membrane filtrating during the filtrating 0 6 bar was used as the threshold to conduct the membrane hydraulic cleaning the total hydraulic cleaning cycle was set as 4 namely the membranes would be regenerated for 4 times to harvest the microalgae when the concentration of microalgae biomass once reached 1 g l the microalgae concentration after the 4 times regeneration would be recorded to analysis the harvesting efficiency of the two types of membranes the harvesting efficiency was calculated by the concentration factor cf as following c f c 0 c f where c0 and cf were the initial and final concentration of the microalgae biomass respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane fouling mitigation as depicted in the part of experimental the membrane performance recovery would be conducted once the tmp on one types of membrane reached 0 6 bar as shown in fig 2 chemical cleaning was conducted at the 18th 29th 38th 41st 48th 50th 51st and 52nd day for pvdf hfms in addition at the 18th 29th and 41st day the microalgae in both two reactors has been cultivated to the concentration of 1 g l therefore the hydraulic cleaning was simultaneously conducted after the microalgae harvesting process in other words the electro fenton cleaning and chemical cleaning following by hydraulic cleaning were implemented for pc chfms and pvdf hfms respectively at the 18th 29th and 41st day even the tmp was less than 0 6 bar it is worth noting that the microalgae broth owned a very low concentration at the first few days after harvesting this also became the reason for better tmp recovery rates for pvdf hfms at the 18th 29th and the 38th day than those at the other times as shown in fig 2a compared with the tmp variations of pc chfms and pvdf hfms the tpm of the pc chfms was always lower than that of pvdf hfms at the same time the total recovery times were only 3 but it needs 8 times of chemical cleaning for pvdf hfms especially the tmp on pvdf hfms was always higher than 0 6 bar during the 48th day to the 53rd day which indicated a poor filtration ability of pvdf hfms under a relatively high microalgae concentration above phenomenon could be attributed to the better pure water permeate flux 1751 6 l bar m2 h higher porosity 87 8 and excellent hydrophilicity of pc chfms contact angle 29 38 than those of pvdf hfms pure water permeate flux 757 2 l bar m2 h porosity 18 5 and contact angle 83 25 he et al 2017 wang et al 2007 the relatively outstanding membrane properties of pc chfms were also conducive to retard tmp increasing at the late period of the operation however it was not optimistic for pvdf hfms after first three times cycle parts of unrecoverable membrane fouling partly damaged the service life of the pvdf hfms meanwhile a few days before the 39th 49th and 53rd day the microalgae biomass was growing closely to 1 g l without harvesting a higher concentration of microalgae than that at the first few days after harvesting conducted the tmp suddenly increased namely the membrane permeate flux suddenly reduced which indicated the application limitation of commercial pvdf hfms the three times of permeate flux recovery rates by electro fenton at the 18th 29th and 41st day were 100 100 and 98 3 respectively fig 2b the corresponding recovery rates by chemical cleaning at the same time were 99 8 81 7 and 54 4 respectively fig 2b combining with the tmp variation in fig 2a the relatively lighter membrane fouling could be one reason for high permeate flux recovery rates of pc chfms with the almost same concentration of microalgae the strong oxidation of oh for pollutant removal than chemical cleaning also made a contribution for better permeate flux recovery rates of pc chfms than those of pvdf chfms after the operation the permeate flux of pc chfms was comparable to the initial state however the recovered pure water permeate flux of pvdf hfms merely accounted for 42 2 of the initial level obviously the electro fenton enhanced pc chfms owned a longer lifetime and a less cleaning times which would decrease the complexity and consumption of the operation fig 3 provided an intuitive evidence for the membrane fouling mitigation performance of electro fenton the surface morphologies were still ambiguous after hydraulic cleaning both of pvdf hfm and pc chfm it indicated that much more pollutants were tightly deposited on membrane surface or deeply blocked the membrane pores which could not be well removed by physical method during microalgae harvesting process it was necessary to conduct other more powerful means to recover membrane filtrating performance from fig 3c the structure of pc chfm was similarly to the pristine membranes after electro fenton effect such a significant mitigation of membrane fouling was firstly attributed to electrostatic repulsive force between foulants and membrane surface which could loose foultants with negative charges and make them easily cleaned by hydraulic cleaning karkooti et al 2020 then the foultants deeply blocked inside the membrane pores or strong attached on the membrane surface would be further oxidized or mineralized by the electro reduction effect of oh above results demonstrated an effective ability of electro fenton for irreversible membrane fouling removal which could not be cleaned by hydraulic cleaning therefore from the tmp variation permeate flux recovery efficiency and sem images results it could be believed that electro fenton effect owned an outstanding membrane fouling alleviation feature 3 2 mechanisms of membrane fouling alleviation eom was recognized as mainly responsible for the membrane fouling during the microalgae harvesting chu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 the main composition of eom protein and polysaccharide with different diameters could deposit on the membrane surface or deeply block membrane pores causing various types of membrane fouling chu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 aim to evaluate the membrane fouling mitigation effect by electro fenton on even though irreversible membrane fouling the content of microalgae derived eom was explored after operation herein after 53 day operation the microalgae derived eom attaching on the fouled membranes and collecting by hydraulic cleaning was referred as reversible eom and eom on the membranes was furthermore extracted by naoh named as irreversible eom as depicted in fig 4 the peaks appeared in the eem images corresponded to protein like compound λex λem 220 280 nm 330 350 nm gong et al 2019 2020 qu et al 2012a murphy et al 2011 overall the fluorophore strength of reversible eom was higher than that of irreversible eom both on pvdf hfms and pc chfms the strength of eom from pvdf hfms was higher than that on pc chfms comparing with the results in fig 4a and b the less content of protein like pollutant showed less reversible membrane fouling forming on the pc chfms during the filtrating also the irreversible eom concentration on pvdf hfms was higher than that on pc chfms in fig 4c and d the less reversible membrane fouling could obviously reduce part of irreversible membrane fouling which transformed from reversible fouling at one hand on the other hand pc chfms exhibited a better hydrophilicity than pvdf hfms which could help to reduce the deposition of pollutants through the water layer and form on the membrane surface wang et al 2007 also the mesh like structure provided by cnts would prevent pollutants especially protein like compound deeply pore blocking to a certain extent rashid et al 2014 furthermore the irreversible membrane fouling was well alleviated from the sem results after operation it also investigated that the electro fenton cleaning could make a great effect for pollutant removal during the filtrating which would be one of another reason for the mitigated membrane fouling at the end operation it is worth noting that the well removed pollutants on in the membranes by electro fenton could also reduce fouling sites for the subsequent pollutants and microalgae specifically the protein and polysaccharides concentration in the reversible eom on pc chfms were 324 8 mg m2 and 1929 9 mg m2 and they were 412 3 mg m2 and 3167 8 mg m2 in eom on pvdf hfms fig 5 a the pollutant concentration was obviously low on the pc chfms it could be attributed to the properties of pc chfms such as good hydrophilicity and mesh like structure rashid et al 2014 wang et al 2007 fig 5b showed the protein and polysaccharides concentration in the irreversible eom they were 63 7 mg m2 and 1303 6 mg m2 respectively on pc chfms which were obviously lower than those on pvdf hfms protein 249 4 mg m2 polysaccharides 2106 5 mg m2 the results were consistent with the previous eem results it is worth noting that the protein concentration was lower than polysaccharides concentration overall this may be because the peptide bonds of proteins were more hydrophobic than polysaccharides chung et al 2016 therefore polysaccharides were easier to adhere to the membrane surface and membrane pores above results indicated an excellent membrane fouling alleviation characteristic of pc chfms compared with commercially pvdf hfms membrane and a better pollutant removal ability of electro fenton than chemical cleaning 3 3 microalgae harvesting efficiency concentration factor cf was used to evaluate the microalgae enrichment and harvesting effect by pc chfms and pvdf hfms as shown in fig 6 the four times of concentration factors of pc chfms were 8 5 8 3 8 2 and 6 2 respectively there was no significant difference in the harvesting efficiency of the first three times due to the tiny flux loss 1 7 with electro fenton enhanced pc chfms fig 2b at the fourth time of microalgae harvesting the cf slightly decreased because of the 1 7 flux loss of pc chfms for pvdf hfms the recovery ability of microalgae was greatly reduced as the recoverable permeate flux was getting less thus the four concentration factors were 5 4 3 9 2 4 and 1 3 respectively the cfs of the e mpbr were 1 6 2 1 3 4 and 4 8 times higher than those of the pvdf hfms respectively the filtrating advantages of pc chfms were becoming more prominent with the extension of operating time above phenomenon could be attributed to the high hydrophilicity and high porosity of pc chfms which endowed the membranes a good anti fouling performance rashid et al 2014 wang et al 2007 at the same time the accumulated pollutants on the pc chfms during the cultivation period were less than that on pvdf hfms therefore the initially higher pure water permeate flux combined with the lighter fouling level of pc chfms made a high cf level of e mpbr moreover the filtrating performance of the pvdf hfms recovered by chemical cleaning was gradually attenuated but the strong pollutant removal ability of electro fenton kept the performance of pc chfms always at a relatively high level yang et al 2013 thus electro fenton reinforced pc chfms performed an excellent microalgae harvesting ability compared with commercialized pvdf hfms 3 4 wastewater treatment the performance of wastewater treatment was vital for considering practical application of this mpbr herein an idea of using simulated municipal wastewater secondary effluent as the feed water could realized dual goals of advanced sewage treatment and microalgae cultivation as shown in fig 7 the nh4 n and tp concentration in the influent wastewater were controlled around approximately 15 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively the removal rates of nh4 n and p at stable culture period in effluent could reach 100 the membranes could further hinder pollutants and microalgae with larger pore size than the membrane diameter from flowing out with the effluent thus take an advantage of pollutants utilization by microalgae however there was almost no difference between e mpbr and mpbr on the pollutant removal rates it could be said that nitrogen and phosphorus were mainly utilized for microalgae growth jiang et al 2018 meanwhile the electrochemical effect only occurred in the phase of microalgae harvesting in other words the removal effect of nh4 n and tp was just inseparable from the growth of microalgae here although the membrane has little difference in further improving the effluent quality the alleviated membrane fouling on pc chfms could maintain membrane permeate flux at a high level for a long time the outstanding properties such as the high porosity high pure water flux and good hydrophilicity might be good for having low tmp for pc chfms membranes as compared to pvdf hfms meanwhile for a long term operation the removal of contaminants by electro fenton might be more effective than chemical cleaning the always outstanding membrane fouling removal effect could reduce the complexity of system maintenance and operation for example the pcchmfs were cleaned only 3 times during the whole operation while 8 times were needed for pvdf hfms by chemical cleaning approach the high level membrane permeate flux also benefited for improving microalgae recovery efficiency where the concentration factor could be 4 8 times higher than that of pvdf hfms the demand of microalgae growth was corresponded to the nh4 n and p removal rates the first few days of the e mpbr and mpbr operation and the first few days after harvesting were the adaptation stage with a low nh4 n and p removal rates the demand for nh4 n and p will increase significantly after the microalgae entering the exponential growth period specifically from the 1st day to the 5th day the initial inorganic c concentration was set as 120 mg l in accordance with the microalgae biological formula co0 48h1 83n0 11p0 01 preliminary ratio of c n p was 80 10 1 however the microalgae growth rate was slow with the removal rate of nh4 n around 70 while the removal rate of p was less than 40 from the 6th day the ratio of c n p was increased to 150 10 1 fig s2 which obviously enhanced the microalgae growth xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 the removal rate of nh4 n and p could obtain to over 95 and 90 respectively for the 2nd 3rd and the 4th cycles microalgae after a short period of 1 2 days for adaptation could fast enter the stage of rapid growth with a removal rate of nitrogen and phosphorus over 93 and 90 respectively both could even reach 100 in the whole words the mpbr and e mpbr with the simulated secondary effluent realized a stable and high effluent quality with nh4 n and p concentrations in the effluent lower than 0 6 mg l and 0 15 mg l respectively under stable operating the good wastewater treatment efficiency depended on the microalgae concentration however the high microalgae concentration conversely caused a serious membrane fouling therefore the outstanding filtrating performance and membrane fouling mitigation strategies were vital for the application of mpbr system 3 5 electrochemical effect on microalgae growth within the 53 day operation the e mpbr and mpbr operated for a total of four cultivation cycles as shown in fig 8 a and table s3 the biomass of microalgae could reach about 1 g l at each cycles overall the growth of microalgae was basically the same in both e mpbr and mpbr under the parallel growth condition during the first cycles the 1st day to the 18th day microalgae grew from 118 7 mg l to 990 3 mg l e mpbr and 926 5 mg l mpbr and the average growth rate was 48 4 mg l d and 44 8 mg l d in e mpbr and mpbr respectively the microalgae owned a good growth overall except for the first five days where the average growths were merely 16 7 mg l d and 13 7 mg l d due to the inappropriate c n ratio singhasuwan et al 2015 xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 therefore the ratio of c n p was increased to 150 10 1 from the 6th day according the instructions in fig s2 the results indicated that the growth rates of the microalgae in the two reactors increased significantly from the 6th day to the 18th day which was about 3 times higher that of the previous especially for the 6th to the 8th day the growth rates could reach 121 05 mg l d in e mpbr and 118 2 mg l d in mpbr the adjustment of c n was also benefited for subsequent microalgae growth so 11 days the 19th the 29th day 12 days the 30th the 41st day and 12 days the 42nd day the 53rd day were enough for microalgae biomass reaching to 1 g l at the 2nd 3rd and the 4th cycles respectively the photosynthesis of microalgae depends on the chlorophyll in the cell which is an important indicator of microalgae biomass therefore the accumulation of chlorophyll in the two reactors was also monitored as shown in fig 8b c and table s3 the variation discipline of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b was roughly the same as the growth trend of microalgae biomass after the four cultivation cycles the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in e mpbr were 20 9 mg l and 7 7 mg l 18 0 mg l and 7 3 mg l 15 3 mg l and 6 5 mg l and 20 9 mg l and 8 2 mg l respectively they were 16 1 mg l and 5 9 mg l 16 3 mg l and 6 9 mg l 17 0 mg l and 7 4 mg l and 20 4 mg l and 8 0 mg l respectively in mpbr the content of chlorophyll has been greatly improved compared with that of initial state in the end the total chlorophyll content could account for 20 30 of the total microalgae biomass chlorophyll has been well accumulated during the cultivation process which revealed a normal operation of the e mpbr systems and provided a guarantee for the subsequent extraction and application of microalgae pigments 4 conclusion the performance of membrane fouling mitigation during microalgae harvesting process has been examined by applying 1 0 v bias on pc chfms based on the derived knowledge both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling caused by eom and microalgae cells could be efficiently removed by electrochemical repulsion and strong oxidation of oh the electrochemical repulsion could exclude away the negatively charged pollutants with loosely attaching on the membrane surface oh form h2o2 with fe2 further removed the pollutants deeply inside pores in comparison to chemical cleaning performance of commercial pvdf hfms only 3 times cleaning were enough for pc chfms while 8 times were needed for pvdf hfms during the whole operation filtrating superiority of pc chfms was more prominent with the extension of operating period even with 1 g l microalgae the concentration factor of pc chfms could be 4 8 times higher than that of the control group in addition the removal rates of nh4 n and tp could reach 100 at stable culture period in effluent in conclusion the utilization of microalgae for wastewater treatment or resource recovery would be an attractive project from a long term perspective the novel electro fenton membrane photobioreactor here feeding by simulated urban secondary effluent realized an outstanding membrane fouling alleviating performance which could obviously prolong the lifetime of membranes the high microalgae harvesting efficiency together with the good effluent quality also described the feasibility of electro fenton reinforced membrane photobioreactor for microalgae harvesting author agreement all

16349,an innovative electro fenton enhanced membrane photobioreactor with satisfactory membrane fouling mitigation was constructed for microalgae harvesting the porous carbon and carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes pc chfms were used as the separation unit and cathode simultaneously h2o2 was generated by cathode reducing o2 in situ which would further produce oh as the main oxidant by coupling h2o2 with fe2 the oh could deeply remove the extracellular organic matter eom deposited on the membrane surface or inside the pores experimental results showed that the permeate flux recovery rates of pc chfms by electro fenton at the 18th 29th and 41st day were 100 100 and 98 3 respectively the corresponding recovery rates by chemical cleaning at the same time were 99 8 81 7 and 54 4 the stable and high permeate flux of pc chfms made a great contribution to the microalgae harvesting efficiency where the concentration factor could be 4 8 times higher than that of the control group filtrating superiority of pc chfms was becoming more prominent with the extension of operating time in addition the removal efficiency of nh4 n and tp in wastewater was approximately 100 at stable culture period graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords porous carbon electro fenton oh microalgae harvesting membrane fouling 1 introduction recently microalgae have been well recognized as a potential alternative source of biofuel and high valued products including biodiesel biomethane bioethanol biohydrogen and biobutanol etc chisti 2007 rawat et al 2011 they are able to provide up to 25 of the global required energy christenson and sims 2011 rawat et al 2011 also it plays a critical role in wastewater bioremediation and co2 sequestration pires et al 2013 razzak et al 2013 however microalgae broth generally requires some procedures such as cultivation harvesting up concentration and dewatering before entering next processing for further utilization at present parts of high value products from microalgae including food supplements natural pigments and polyunsaturated fatty acids are only produced by a limited scale system raja et al 2008 due to the small size typically a few micrometers and low concentration 0 5 2 g l in the culture medium of microalgae therefore an efficient and economical means to harvest microalgae biomass will be an important challenge to promote their full scale application greenwell et al 2010 nowadays energy intensive up centrifugation is widely adopted by most existing microalgae production systems which takes a major proportion of the total energy demand of the production process grima et al 2003 also the method of flotation has the same drawback like up centrifugation rawat et al 2011 singh and patidar 2018 other current microalgae harvesting methods including gravity precipitation and flocculation suffered from the characteristics of low efficiency and environmental unfriendliness rawat et al 2011 singh and patidar 2018 actually it is very common to combine two or more of these technologies to achieve a great separation efficiency and save the energy membrane separation process continuous or intermittent mode with a cheaper cost than up centrifugation method is known as a very promising technology for microalgae harvesting during this process chemicals coagulants or flocculants are not needed which can prevent the hazardous substances accumulating inside the biomass or the recycled streams vandamme et al 2011 also membrane separation with the characteristic of almost complete retention of biomass compared to other harvesting methods owns a good microalgae quality mouchet and bonnelye 1998 because the microalgae cells are less disrupted without chemicals adding into the microalgae broth wicaksana et al 2012 mechanisms of membrane separation potentially have disinfection effect via removal of protozoa and viruses judd 2006 currently several types of membranes including polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polyacrylonitrile polyether sulfone and polytetra fluoroethylene polyethersulfone polyvinyl pyrollidone polyvinyl choloride membranes de baerdemaeker et al 2013 drexler and yeh 2014 have been researched for harvesting microalgae but their applications were hindered by low permeate flux and rapid membrane fouling milledge and heaven 2013 in microalgae harvesting process microalgae cells and extracellular organic matter eom including polysaccharides proteins and humic acids etc are recognized as the main contaminants for membrane fouling zhao et al 2015 during the filtrating microalgae and eom will be loosely deposited on the membranes and form reversible fouling at first which can be easily removed by physical means chiou et al 2010 qu et al 2012b with the advancing of the filtration process irreversible fouling will occur when pollutants are tightly compacted on the membrane surface or deeply blocked the pores qu et al 2012b zhao et al 2017 which generally needs chemical methods to mitigate however the chemicals will not only corrode the membrane materials but also remain harmful impurities to the system and environment meanwhile still part of unrecoverable membrane fouling still exists therefore seeking for environmentally friendly and high efficient membrane fouling alleviation means mainly an efficacious eom removal method is essential previous studies have verified that the electrochemical effect can make a great contribution on membrane fouling mitigation during the microalgae harvesting process because the microalgae and most composition of eom are negatively charged kim et al 2014 mushtaq et al 2019 electrochemical repulsion effect can repel charged microalgae and eom electrochemical oxidation can well remove the pollutants deeply in the membrane pores meanwhile the conductive membranes under bias exhibit electrophoresis electroosmotic leakage electromigration and other electric and transistor phenomenon which also help to improve the membrane separation performance however the membrane fouling alleviation performance is limited by the level of applied bias in previous studies the applied bias was generally distributed in 3 68 v to 30 v which increased the energy consumption for the whole systems kim et al 2014 mushtaq et al 2019 thus it is attractive to take advantage of electrochemistry under a low energy consumption conditions metal organic framework derived porous carbon pc with massive micropores high specific surface area and abundant active sites is known as a superior electro catalytic material which is in favor of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 generation yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 pc blending with fe2 can in situ further generate oh which has a strong oxidation ability for pollutants degradation wang et al 2013 it can be inferred that pc provides a new types of membrane materials to practice energy saved microalgae harvesting strategy herein the pc and carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membrane loaded with fe2 referred to pc chfms was used as cathode and separation unit simultaneously to construct the integrated electro fenton enhanced membrane photobioreactor for microalgae cultivation and harvesting oh was used as a membrane fouling removal reagent the comprehensive performance of membrane fouling mitigation ability was evaluated during the whole operation also the wastewater treatment and microalgae harvesting efficiency were further discussed in this study 2 experimental 2 1 e mpbr setup and operation two parallel laboratory scale membrane photobioreactors with the working volume of 280 ml were built up at 25 0 5 c in an illuminated incubator for wastewater treatment microalgae cultivation and microalgae enrichment fig 1 the light dark cycle was set as 8 h 8 h with the light intensity of 36 w m2 at the light phase among them electro enhanced membrane photobioreactor e mpbr with the pc chfms and fe2 121 1 mg g membrane was used as separation and cathode simultaneously in experimental group the titanium mesh was used as anode the membrane photobioreactor with traditional pvdf hollow fiber membranes pvdf hfms was set as control group the total effective area was 14 6 cm2 the oh produced on electro enhanced pc chfms with fe2 was recorded by esr spectrum of using dmpo trapping agent fig s1 other prosperities of the membranes were presented on the table s1 coelastrum with initial inoculation amount of 100 mg l was cultivated with sterilized bg11 medium without gas supplying and harvested by membrane filtration the influent of the reactors was simulated urban secondary effluent the specific components were shown in table s2 c n p 80 10 1 during the 1st day to the 6th day c n p 150 10 1 from the 7th day to the 53rd day the reasons were exhibited in the supporting information and fig s2 the ph 9 10 in the reactor is maintained within the optimum range for the growth of microalgae fig s3 4 the reactors were operated in batch mode with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 96 h each cycle time was 720 min with 5 min for water inflow 595 min for reaction 120 min for discharging the water output through the membranes was 35 ml for each time the 1 g l of the microalgae concentration was used as threshold for conducting the microalgae recovery the membranes would be cleaned at the same time followed by putting them into the next experiment cycle the total cycles of the microalgae cultivation were determined by performance of the membranes meanwhile during the operation the membranes will be cleaned once the tmp reached 0 6 bar the pc chfms were cleaned by electro fenton with the 1 0 v bias applied on the membranes and the pvdf hfms were cleaned by soaking in 400 ppm sodium hypochlorite the optimum cleaning time for the two types of polluted membranes was determined by the recovery level of pure water permeate flux as shown in fig s5 45 min and 75 min were used for polluted pc chfms and pvdf hfms recovery respectively 2 2 membrane fouling assessment membrane fouling was assessed by transmembrane pressure tmp variation sem images were used to provide intuitive membrane fouling level after operation after hydraulic cleaning and chemical cleaning electro fenton recovery the eom compositions and concentration on membranes were analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fl4500 hitachi japan also the pure water permeate flux recovery rates of membranes would be calculated after cleaning to revel the membrane anti fouling performance 2 3 evaluation of microalgae growth the variations of microalgae biomass chlorophyll a chla and chlorophyll b chlb during the whole operation were detected to reflect the growth of microalgae among them the microalgae biomass concentration was evaluated by the optical density of the microalgae solution at wavelength of 690 nm od690 by a uv spectrophotometer uv 6100 mapada china the chlorophyll was also determined by uv spectrophotometer uv 6100 mapada china briefly take 5 ml of microalgae liquid from the reactor and filter it by a 0 22 μm mixed fiber filter membrane put the microalgae with the mixed fiber filter membrane into 5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and keep it at 70 c for 5 min the supernatant was collected by centrifuge 10 000 rpm 5 min then absorbance of the supernatant at 650 nm od650 and 666 nm od666 were measure by spectrophotometer chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b concentration were calculated according to the following formula c c h l a m g l 13 34 o d 666 4 85 o d 650 c c h l b m g l 24 58 o d 650 6 65 o d 666 2 4 reactor performance analysis nh4 n and p removal efficiency were used to investigate the wastewater treatment performance of the mpbr and e mpbr the nh4 n and p were measured by national standard classical analytical method nessler s reagent spectrophotometry hj 535 2009 and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry gb 11 893 89 respectively the removal rate e was calculated as follows e c f c p c f where cf and cp were the pollutants concentration in influent and in effluent respectively 2 5 microalgae harvesting the microalgae were harvested by the method of membrane filtrating during the filtrating 0 6 bar was used as the threshold to conduct the membrane hydraulic cleaning the total hydraulic cleaning cycle was set as 4 namely the membranes would be regenerated for 4 times to harvest the microalgae when the concentration of microalgae biomass once reached 1 g l the microalgae concentration after the 4 times regeneration would be recorded to analysis the harvesting efficiency of the two types of membranes the harvesting efficiency was calculated by the concentration factor cf as following c f c 0 c f where c0 and cf were the initial and final concentration of the microalgae biomass respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane fouling mitigation as depicted in the part of experimental the membrane performance recovery would be conducted once the tmp on one types of membrane reached 0 6 bar as shown in fig 2 chemical cleaning was conducted at the 18th 29th 38th 41st 48th 50th 51st and 52nd day for pvdf hfms in addition at the 18th 29th and 41st day the microalgae in both two reactors has been cultivated to the concentration of 1 g l therefore the hydraulic cleaning was simultaneously conducted after the microalgae harvesting process in other words the electro fenton cleaning and chemical cleaning following by hydraulic cleaning were implemented for pc chfms and pvdf hfms respectively at the 18th 29th and 41st day even the tmp was less than 0 6 bar it is worth noting that the microalgae broth owned a very low concentration at the first few days after harvesting this also became the reason for better tmp recovery rates for pvdf hfms at the 18th 29th and the 38th day than those at the other times as shown in fig 2a compared with the tmp variations of pc chfms and pvdf hfms the tpm of the pc chfms was always lower than that of pvdf hfms at the same time the total recovery times were only 3 but it needs 8 times of chemical cleaning for pvdf hfms especially the tmp on pvdf hfms was always higher than 0 6 bar during the 48th day to the 53rd day which indicated a poor filtration ability of pvdf hfms under a relatively high microalgae concentration above phenomenon could be attributed to the better pure water permeate flux 1751 6 l bar m2 h higher porosity 87 8 and excellent hydrophilicity of pc chfms contact angle 29 38 than those of pvdf hfms pure water permeate flux 757 2 l bar m2 h porosity 18 5 and contact angle 83 25 he et al 2017 wang et al 2007 the relatively outstanding membrane properties of pc chfms were also conducive to retard tmp increasing at the late period of the operation however it was not optimistic for pvdf hfms after first three times cycle parts of unrecoverable membrane fouling partly damaged the service life of the pvdf hfms meanwhile a few days before the 39th 49th and 53rd day the microalgae biomass was growing closely to 1 g l without harvesting a higher concentration of microalgae than that at the first few days after harvesting conducted the tmp suddenly increased namely the membrane permeate flux suddenly reduced which indicated the application limitation of commercial pvdf hfms the three times of permeate flux recovery rates by electro fenton at the 18th 29th and 41st day were 100 100 and 98 3 respectively fig 2b the corresponding recovery rates by chemical cleaning at the same time were 99 8 81 7 and 54 4 respectively fig 2b combining with the tmp variation in fig 2a the relatively lighter membrane fouling could be one reason for high permeate flux recovery rates of pc chfms with the almost same concentration of microalgae the strong oxidation of oh for pollutant removal than chemical cleaning also made a contribution for better permeate flux recovery rates of pc chfms than those of pvdf chfms after the operation the permeate flux of pc chfms was comparable to the initial state however the recovered pure water permeate flux of pvdf hfms merely accounted for 42 2 of the initial level obviously the electro fenton enhanced pc chfms owned a longer lifetime and a less cleaning times which would decrease the complexity and consumption of the operation fig 3 provided an intuitive evidence for the membrane fouling mitigation performance of electro fenton the surface morphologies were still ambiguous after hydraulic cleaning both of pvdf hfm and pc chfm it indicated that much more pollutants were tightly deposited on membrane surface or deeply blocked the membrane pores which could not be well removed by physical method during microalgae harvesting process it was necessary to conduct other more powerful means to recover membrane filtrating performance from fig 3c the structure of pc chfm was similarly to the pristine membranes after electro fenton effect such a significant mitigation of membrane fouling was firstly attributed to electrostatic repulsive force between foulants and membrane surface which could loose foultants with negative charges and make them easily cleaned by hydraulic cleaning karkooti et al 2020 then the foultants deeply blocked inside the membrane pores or strong attached on the membrane surface would be further oxidized or mineralized by the electro reduction effect of oh above results demonstrated an effective ability of electro fenton for irreversible membrane fouling removal which could not be cleaned by hydraulic cleaning therefore from the tmp variation permeate flux recovery efficiency and sem images results it could be believed that electro fenton effect owned an outstanding membrane fouling alleviation feature 3 2 mechanisms of membrane fouling alleviation eom was recognized as mainly responsible for the membrane fouling during the microalgae harvesting chu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 the main composition of eom protein and polysaccharide with different diameters could deposit on the membrane surface or deeply block membrane pores causing various types of membrane fouling chu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 aim to evaluate the membrane fouling mitigation effect by electro fenton on even though irreversible membrane fouling the content of microalgae derived eom was explored after operation herein after 53 day operation the microalgae derived eom attaching on the fouled membranes and collecting by hydraulic cleaning was referred as reversible eom and eom on the membranes was furthermore extracted by naoh named as irreversible eom as depicted in fig 4 the peaks appeared in the eem images corresponded to protein like compound λex λem 220 280 nm 330 350 nm gong et al 2019 2020 qu et al 2012a murphy et al 2011 overall the fluorophore strength of reversible eom was higher than that of irreversible eom both on pvdf hfms and pc chfms the strength of eom from pvdf hfms was higher than that on pc chfms comparing with the results in fig 4a and b the less content of protein like pollutant showed less reversible membrane fouling forming on the pc chfms during the filtrating also the irreversible eom concentration on pvdf hfms was higher than that on pc chfms in fig 4c and d the less reversible membrane fouling could obviously reduce part of irreversible membrane fouling which transformed from reversible fouling at one hand on the other hand pc chfms exhibited a better hydrophilicity than pvdf hfms which could help to reduce the deposition of pollutants through the water layer and form on the membrane surface wang et al 2007 also the mesh like structure provided by cnts would prevent pollutants especially protein like compound deeply pore blocking to a certain extent rashid et al 2014 furthermore the irreversible membrane fouling was well alleviated from the sem results after operation it also investigated that the electro fenton cleaning could make a great effect for pollutant removal during the filtrating which would be one of another reason for the mitigated membrane fouling at the end operation it is worth noting that the well removed pollutants on in the membranes by electro fenton could also reduce fouling sites for the subsequent pollutants and microalgae specifically the protein and polysaccharides concentration in the reversible eom on pc chfms were 324 8 mg m2 and 1929 9 mg m2 and they were 412 3 mg m2 and 3167 8 mg m2 in eom on pvdf hfms fig 5 a the pollutant concentration was obviously low on the pc chfms it could be attributed to the properties of pc chfms such as good hydrophilicity and mesh like structure rashid et al 2014 wang et al 2007 fig 5b showed the protein and polysaccharides concentration in the irreversible eom they were 63 7 mg m2 and 1303 6 mg m2 respectively on pc chfms which were obviously lower than those on pvdf hfms protein 249 4 mg m2 polysaccharides 2106 5 mg m2 the results were consistent with the previous eem results it is worth noting that the protein concentration was lower than polysaccharides concentration overall this may be because the peptide bonds of proteins were more hydrophobic than polysaccharides chung et al 2016 therefore polysaccharides were easier to adhere to the membrane surface and membrane pores above results indicated an excellent membrane fouling alleviation characteristic of pc chfms compared with commercially pvdf hfms membrane and a better pollutant removal ability of electro fenton than chemical cleaning 3 3 microalgae harvesting efficiency concentration factor cf was used to evaluate the microalgae enrichment and harvesting effect by pc chfms and pvdf hfms as shown in fig 6 the four times of concentration factors of pc chfms were 8 5 8 3 8 2 and 6 2 respectively there was no significant difference in the harvesting efficiency of the first three times due to the tiny flux loss 1 7 with electro fenton enhanced pc chfms fig 2b at the fourth time of microalgae harvesting the cf slightly decreased because of the 1 7 flux loss of pc chfms for pvdf hfms the recovery ability of microalgae was greatly reduced as the recoverable permeate flux was getting less thus the four concentration factors were 5 4 3 9 2 4 and 1 3 respectively the cfs of the e mpbr were 1 6 2 1 3 4 and 4 8 times higher than those of the pvdf hfms respectively the filtrating advantages of pc chfms were becoming more prominent with the extension of operating time above phenomenon could be attributed to the high hydrophilicity and high porosity of pc chfms which endowed the membranes a good anti fouling performance rashid et al 2014 wang et al 2007 at the same time the accumulated pollutants on the pc chfms during the cultivation period were less than that on pvdf hfms therefore the initially higher pure water permeate flux combined with the lighter fouling level of pc chfms made a high cf level of e mpbr moreover the filtrating performance of the pvdf hfms recovered by chemical cleaning was gradually attenuated but the strong pollutant removal ability of electro fenton kept the performance of pc chfms always at a relatively high level yang et al 2013 thus electro fenton reinforced pc chfms performed an excellent microalgae harvesting ability compared with commercialized pvdf hfms 3 4 wastewater treatment the performance of wastewater treatment was vital for considering practical application of this mpbr herein an idea of using simulated municipal wastewater secondary effluent as the feed water could realized dual goals of advanced sewage treatment and microalgae cultivation as shown in fig 7 the nh4 n and tp concentration in the influent wastewater were controlled around approximately 15 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively the removal rates of nh4 n and p at stable culture period in effluent could reach 100 the membranes could further hinder pollutants and microalgae with larger pore size than the membrane diameter from flowing out with the effluent thus take an advantage of pollutants utilization by microalgae however there was almost no difference between e mpbr and mpbr on the pollutant removal rates it could be said that nitrogen and phosphorus were mainly utilized for microalgae growth jiang et al 2018 meanwhile the electrochemical effect only occurred in the phase of microalgae harvesting in other words the removal effect of nh4 n and tp was just inseparable from the growth of microalgae here although the membrane has little difference in further improving the effluent quality the alleviated membrane fouling on pc chfms could maintain membrane permeate flux at a high level for a long time the outstanding properties such as the high porosity high pure water flux and good hydrophilicity might be good for having low tmp for pc chfms membranes as compared to pvdf hfms meanwhile for a long term operation the removal of contaminants by electro fenton might be more effective than chemical cleaning the always outstanding membrane fouling removal effect could reduce the complexity of system maintenance and operation for example the pcchmfs were cleaned only 3 times during the whole operation while 8 times were needed for pvdf hfms by chemical cleaning approach the high level membrane permeate flux also benefited for improving microalgae recovery efficiency where the concentration factor could be 4 8 times higher than that of pvdf hfms the demand of microalgae growth was corresponded to the nh4 n and p removal rates the first few days of the e mpbr and mpbr operation and the first few days after harvesting were the adaptation stage with a low nh4 n and p removal rates the demand for nh4 n and p will increase significantly after the microalgae entering the exponential growth period specifically from the 1st day to the 5th day the initial inorganic c concentration was set as 120 mg l in accordance with the microalgae biological formula co0 48h1 83n0 11p0 01 preliminary ratio of c n p was 80 10 1 however the microalgae growth rate was slow with the removal rate of nh4 n around 70 while the removal rate of p was less than 40 from the 6th day the ratio of c n p was increased to 150 10 1 fig s2 which obviously enhanced the microalgae growth xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 the removal rate of nh4 n and p could obtain to over 95 and 90 respectively for the 2nd 3rd and the 4th cycles microalgae after a short period of 1 2 days for adaptation could fast enter the stage of rapid growth with a removal rate of nitrogen and phosphorus over 93 and 90 respectively both could even reach 100 in the whole words the mpbr and e mpbr with the simulated secondary effluent realized a stable and high effluent quality with nh4 n and p concentrations in the effluent lower than 0 6 mg l and 0 15 mg l respectively under stable operating the good wastewater treatment efficiency depended on the microalgae concentration however the high microalgae concentration conversely caused a serious membrane fouling therefore the outstanding filtrating performance and membrane fouling mitigation strategies were vital for the application of mpbr system 3 5 electrochemical effect on microalgae growth within the 53 day operation the e mpbr and mpbr operated for a total of four cultivation cycles as shown in fig 8 a and table s3 the biomass of microalgae could reach about 1 g l at each cycles overall the growth of microalgae was basically the same in both e mpbr and mpbr under the parallel growth condition during the first cycles the 1st day to the 18th day microalgae grew from 118 7 mg l to 990 3 mg l e mpbr and 926 5 mg l mpbr and the average growth rate was 48 4 mg l d and 44 8 mg l d in e mpbr and mpbr respectively the microalgae owned a good growth overall except for the first five days where the average growths were merely 16 7 mg l d and 13 7 mg l d due to the inappropriate c n ratio singhasuwan et al 2015 xu et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 therefore the ratio of c n p was increased to 150 10 1 from the 6th day according the instructions in fig s2 the results indicated that the growth rates of the microalgae in the two reactors increased significantly from the 6th day to the 18th day which was about 3 times higher that of the previous especially for the 6th to the 8th day the growth rates could reach 121 05 mg l d in e mpbr and 118 2 mg l d in mpbr the adjustment of c n was also benefited for subsequent microalgae growth so 11 days the 19th the 29th day 12 days the 30th the 41st day and 12 days the 42nd day the 53rd day were enough for microalgae biomass reaching to 1 g l at the 2nd 3rd and the 4th cycles respectively the photosynthesis of microalgae depends on the chlorophyll in the cell which is an important indicator of microalgae biomass therefore the accumulation of chlorophyll in the two reactors was also monitored as shown in fig 8b c and table s3 the variation discipline of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b was roughly the same as the growth trend of microalgae biomass after the four cultivation cycles the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in e mpbr were 20 9 mg l and 7 7 mg l 18 0 mg l and 7 3 mg l 15 3 mg l and 6 5 mg l and 20 9 mg l and 8 2 mg l respectively they were 16 1 mg l and 5 9 mg l 16 3 mg l and 6 9 mg l 17 0 mg l and 7 4 mg l and 20 4 mg l and 8 0 mg l respectively in mpbr the content of chlorophyll has been greatly improved compared with that of initial state in the end the total chlorophyll content could account for 20 30 of the total microalgae biomass chlorophyll has been well accumulated during the cultivation process which revealed a normal operation of the e mpbr systems and provided a guarantee for the subsequent extraction and application of microalgae pigments 4 conclusion the performance of membrane fouling mitigation during microalgae harvesting process has been examined by applying 1 0 v bias on pc chfms based on the derived knowledge both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling caused by eom and microalgae cells could be efficiently removed by electrochemical repulsion and strong oxidation of oh the electrochemical repulsion could exclude away the negatively charged pollutants with loosely attaching on the membrane surface oh form h2o2 with fe2 further removed the pollutants deeply inside pores in comparison to chemical cleaning performance of commercial pvdf hfms only 3 times cleaning were enough for pc chfms while 8 times were needed for pvdf hfms during the whole operation filtrating superiority of pc chfms was more prominent with the extension of operating period even with 1 g l microalgae the concentration factor of pc chfms could be 4 8 times higher than that of the control group in addition the removal rates of nh4 n and tp could reach 100 at stable culture period in effluent in conclusion the utilization of microalgae for wastewater treatment or resource recovery would be an attractive project from a long term perspective the novel electro fenton membrane photobioreactor here feeding by simulated urban secondary effluent realized an outstanding membrane fouling alleviating performance which could obviously prolong the lifetime of membranes the high microalgae harvesting efficiency together with the good effluent quality also described the feasibility of electro fenton reinforced membrane photobioreactor for microalgae harvesting author agreement all
