18970,a novel pyrolusite fluidized bed pfb contactor which we recently developed for dissolved manganese mn ii removal through surface adsorption and subsequent oxidation by free chlorine was modeled in this study the hydrodynamic behavior of the filter media and water in the fluidized bed was described by the axial dispersion model the model incorporated the effects of axial mixing in the liquid and solid phases mass transfer resistance in a laminar fluid boundary layer surrounding a media grain and a second order oxidation rate expression the experimental data from lab scale and field pilot scale contactors was adopted for the model development and its validation for the former the data was employed to estimate the oxidation rate constant the mass transfer coefficient and the axial solid phase dispersion coefficient for the model the model simulations matched the experimental data with less than 20 error across a wide range of mn ii and free chlorine concentrations and hydraulic loading rates that might be encountered in a drinking water treatment plant the sensitivity analysis showed that the time to breakthrough is most sensitive to the adsorption isotherm constants and the oxidation rate constant these observations indicate that the alluded parameters mainly control the performance of the pfb contactor as well as the process stability finally a sample application of the model to acquire operational inputs was illustrated by analyzing the effect of free chlorine concentration on mn ii removal performance and breakthrough time within a pfb contactor graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water manganese removal pyrolusite fluidized bed contactor modeling breakthrough 1 introduction soluble manganese mn ii naturally occurs in groundwater and anoxic hypolimnion layers of reservoirs and lakes mn ii is gradually oxidized in chlorinated water distribution systems and results in aesthetic and operating problems including discoloration of water metallic taste and odor and staining of the plumbing fixtures as well as scaling and clogging of pipes the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2004 has recommended an aesthetic drinking water objective of 0 05 mg l 1 for manganese however manganese concentration as low as 0 02 mg l 1 may still cause aesthetic problems sly et al 1990 in addition chronic exposure to manganese from drinking water may lead to neurological disorders wasserman et al 2006 and intellectual impairment in children bouchard et al 2011 accordingly health canada 2016 proposed an aesthetic objective limit of 0 02 mg l 1 and a health based value of 0 10 mg l 1 for manganese in drinking water various industrial processes have been applied for manganese control in drinking water such as chemical oxidation followed by solid liquid separation techniques knocke et al 1990b microbiological oxidation under aerobic condition burger et al 2008 and adsorption and oxidation onto manganese oxide mnox s coated media islam et al 2010 knocke et al 1990a the latter process also known as natural greensand effect nge process is an effective and economic method which has been widely implemented in the past decade in this process mn ii is adsorbed onto the mnox s coating and then oxidized by chlorine creating additional mnox s recent studies depicted a strong adsorption capacity of pyrolusite a natural manganese dioxide ore for mn ii zuravnsky 2006 knocke et al 2010 dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 at a discernibly higher level than mnox s coated media zuravnsky 2006 knocke et al 2010 although mnox s has a high affinity for mn ii adsorption the maintenance of available sorption sites which is mainly governed by free chlorine concentration is crucial for the continuous operation of this process knocke et al 1990a dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 even though knocke et al 1990a stated that a continuous regeneration of the adsorption sites can be achieved by maintaining the residual free chlorine concentration of 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 in the effluent recent studies revealed that stable mn ii removal from water with high mn ii concentrations 0 3 mg l 1 requires much higher residual free chlorine in the effluent to fulfill the continuous regeneration of the adsorption sites and hence the stable mn ii removal dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 dashtban kenari et al 2017 this is especially important for mn ii removal under low water temperatures a packed bed adsorption configuration has been traditionally chosen for mn ii control by nge process nonetheless several problems such as excessive head loss buildup large volumes of wastewater generation during backwashing air binding and fouling with particulate matter are associated with this process in order to remedy these drawbacks we recently developed a novel pyrolusite fluidized bed pfb contactor process for mn ii removal from groundwater dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 dashtban kenari et al 2017 the experimental data obtained from lab and field pilot scale pfb contactors revealed effective mn ii removal under different water quality and operating conditions this process also allows operation at much higher hydraulic loading rates hlrs up to 60 m h 1 dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 compared to a packed bed contactor 6 12 m h 1 hargette and knocke 2001 piispanen and sallanko 2010 while adopting small sized media 0 3 0 8 mm which provides a high adsorption surface area in a separate study knocke et al 2010 employed much larger pyrolusite grains 2 0 2 4 mm which allowed operation at high hlrs 40 60 m h 1 without excessive head loss development in expense of either decreasing the adsorption surface area at identical bed inventory as smaller grain size media or increasing the bed inventory to reach an identical adsorption surface area as smaller grain size media although the experimental data demonstrated the promising capabilities of this process we could only explore a limited number of conditions experimentally however credible information is required for the design scale up and performance evaluation of these contactors under various operating conditions while the cost risk and endeavors required to experimentally explore all conditions scenarios cannot be justified the availability of an accurate model for pfb contactor can offer invaluable benefits merkle et al 1997 and bierlein et al 2015 developed a phenomenological model for mn ii removal in a packed bed contactor under low hlrs 6 24 m h 1 and high hlrs 40 60 m h 1 employing large media grains 1 5 2 0 mm respectively with low mn ii levels in the feed water the model by bierlein et al 2015 only focused on steady state condition due to the low concentration of mn ii 0 2 mg l 1 in the feed water and relatively high free chlorine concentrations 1 3 1 4 mg l 1 which provided continuous regeneration of the filter media in this regard developing a model which can simulate mn ii removal profile and breakthrough time i e the operating time at which the effluent mn ii concentration exceeds the target level under high mn ii concentrations up to 0 8 mg l 1 and hlrs up to 45 m h 1 as well as various chlorine concentrations is of great importance to the authors knowledge there are no models available in the open literature that can simulate the mn ii removal performance in a pfb contactor the current study aimed at developing a phenomenological model that can simulate the mn ii removal profile by nge process and the breakthrough time in a fluidized bed contactor containing pyrolusite media the developed model was initially validated by experimental data the critical parameters of this process were then identified with the help of the developed model through a series of sensitivity analyses eventually an example of the model application is illustrated by altering the free chlorine concentration under a specific condition and analyzing its impact on mn ii control and breakthrough time within a pfb contactor 2 contactor model the pyrolusite fluidized bed contactor was modeled as a continuum of uniformly dispersed particles in water for an expanded bed height h inspired by the previous models that were developed for a packed bed contactor merkle et al 1997 bierlein et al 2015 the development of the current model begins with the mass balance of mn ii in the bulk and adsorbed phase on the surface of the media and a mass balance of bulk chlorine across an incremental height of the media in the fluidized bed contactor this is schematically shown in fig 1 the equations of the present model have been derived based on the following simplifying assumptions 1 pyrolusite is of uniform particle size equal to the median size of the distribution 2 the lateral concentration gradients are negligible for both mn ii and free chlorine in the liquid phase of the column 3 the adsorption process is rapid so that a local equilibrium is achieved at the pyrolusite surface between the mn ii concentrations at the liquid solid interface and the adsorbed phase 4 adsorption of mn ii onto the pyrolusite surface can be represented by a freundlich isotherm over the concentrations applied in this study zuravnsky 2006 bierlein et al 2015 5 adsorption and surface oxidation occur on the external surface of the pyrolusite grains bierlein et al 2015 6 the adsorption rate is limited by the mass transfer resistance in the laminar fluid boundary layer surrounding a pyrolusite grain the mass transfer rate is controlled by both a mass transfer coefficient which mainly depends on fluid velocity and a mn ii concentration gradient from bulk to surface that exists owing to the rate of oxidation of sorbed mn ii that keeps regenerating sorption sites 7 thermal effects are negligible indicating isothermal adsorption of mn ii from dilute solution 8 the concentration of chlorine in the boundary layer of water surrounding the pyrolusite media is equal to the chlorine concentration in the bulk water i e the mass transfer of free chlorine in the boundary layer is negligible because an excess chlorine concentration of at least 1 mg l 1 was always present along the contactor height one must note that if an excess bulk chlorine concentration is not satisfied the mass transfer of free chlorine in the boundary layer must be included in the model 9 additional species that might interfere with adsorption or oxidation are not present and the size of pyrolusite grain remains constant over the course of operation 10 the hydrodynamic behavior of the pyrolusite grains and water in the fluidized bed can be described by the axial dispersion model veeraraghavan and fan 1989 li et al 2005 to represent the random movements of solid grains and liquid molecules along the bulk flow path such random movements give rise to deviations from the average velocity the binary collision between particles and granule wall collisions as well as the mutual interaction between the local fluid flow and particles yield solid dispersion in a liquid solid fluidized bed the soluble manganese removal process is modeled by advection and axial dispersion of liquid within the fluidized bed followed by mass transfer through the boundary layer surrounding the pyrolusite grains the adsorbed mn ii on the pyrolusite media can then be oxidized by the free chlorine i e regeneration of the adsorption sites the mass balance for the free chlorine in the bulk solution can be described by advection axial dispersion of liquid and oxidation reaction of free chlorine with adsorbed mn ii the mass balance of adsorbed mn ii consists of its adsorption onto the media surface oxidation by free chlorine and an axial mixing in the solid phase the degree of axial mixing of the fluidizing liquid and fluidized particles in the bed are expressed by the corresponding dispersion coefficients d l and d s respectively the mass balance equations for mn ii eq 1 and free chlorine eq 2 in the bulk water as well as adsorbed phase mn ii eq 3 on the surface of pyrolusite media were subsequently derived based on the above assumptions and conceptual explanations mentioned here the adopted variables in these equations and their definitions are listed in table 1 the mass balance equation for mn ii in the bulk water is given as follows 1 c m n b t u ε e c m n b z d l 2 c m n b z 2 a v k f 1 ε e ε e c m n b

solved using an implicit finite difference technique constandtinides and mostoufi 1999 the model was coded in matlab r2015a freundlich isotherm constantans k and n were determined experimentally in this regard short term mn ii adsorption capacity of pyrolusite was determined under each specific ph and temperature by a 4 h recycle method developed by tobiason et al 2008 at the initial stage of modeling the values of all independent parameters except the oxidation rate constant k r were adjusted based on the available empirical correlations as outlined in table 2 however as appropriate simulation performance was not achieved when adopting these estimated values in the model and comparing the model output with the experimental data the proper values of critical parameters were obtained through a fitting process in this regard k r k f and d s values were adjusted by fitting the model output to a set of lab and field pilot scale experimental data mn ii concentration profile within the pfb and free chlorine consumption the accuracy of the adjusted parameters in the developed model were then validated by comparing the simulated mn ii removal profiles with other sets of lab and field pilot scale experimental data these will be discussed in more details in section 4 1 3 experimental the experimental data that was applied to determine and validate the model parameters are selective results from lab and field pilot scale tests which are briefly explained in the following sections 3 1 lab scale tests in order to determine the oxidation rate constant the model simulation was fitted to a set of experimental results obtained from a lab scale pfb contactor for mn ii removal from a synthetic groundwater the characteristics of the synthetic water are listed in table 3 the experimental facility was located in credeau laboratories at polytechnique montréal the pfb column had an inner diameter of 2 54 cm 1 in and a length of 2 5 m which was filled up to 1 0 m with a commercially available pyrolusite media table 4 each experiment was conducted for a period of 12 days to determine the long term performance of the pfb for mn ii removal during these trials 400 l of synthetic groundwater which was renewed every four days was prepared and fed to the column a diluted bleach solution 500 mg cl2 l 1 was continuously injected into the water prior entering the column in order to determine the mn ii concentration profile within the pfb contactor the total and dissolved manganese concentrations filterable through a 0 45 μm millipore filter cat no hawp02500 were measured at different sampling points along the bed height 0 5 17 5 25 50 75 100 and 110 cm from the mesh screen located at the bottom of the column at the end of each experiment the bed was expanded to around 50 for 10 min followed by an overnight regeneration of the media with 8 l of recirculating chlorine solution 100 mg cl2 l 1 a detailed description of the lab scale experimental facility was expressed elsewhere dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 3 2 field pilot scale tests the experimental data obtained by a field pilot scale pfb contactor for mn ii removal from a natural groundwater was adopted to adjust the model s critical parameters and validate the model the pilot plant was placed at a groundwater treatment facility in sainte marthe sur le lac quebec canada the characteristics of the natural groundwater are listed in table 5 the pfb column was made of a clear polyvinyl chloride pipe with 2 5 m length and 15 2 cm 6 in inner diameter it was filled to 90 cm with the commercially available pyrolusite media table 4 the natural groundwater was fed to the column at a flow rate of 30 45 m h 1 12 18 gpm ft 2 yielding a bed expansion of 10 20 in order to continuously regenerate the media a commercial bleach solution 4 w v cl2 l 1 was injected into the water before entering the column to reach 1 4 mg cl2 l 1 chlorine residual in the influent water samples were taken at the inlet distributor level and 7 5 15 30 60 100 and 110 cm above the distributor both total and dissolved manganese concentrations filterable through a 0 45 μm syringe filter pvdf cat no cs glpv3045 were measured at each sampling point over a 21 day of experimental period for each condition in order to effectively remove the loosely attached particles from the media the pfb was expended to 40 for 20 min at the end of each experiment afterwards the media was completely regenerated with recirculating a 50 l diluted bleach solution 1 w v cl2 l 1 for 24 h to maintain an identical condition for all experiments while applying the same pyrolusite media in the column a detailed description of the field scale pilot plant can be obtained elsewhere dashtban kenari et al 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 model development and validation four representative set of results from the long term lab and field pilot scale studies were adopted to develop and validate the mechanistic model for mn ii removal within the pfb contactor all experiments were conducted at 9 1 c whereas the hlr concentration of mn ii or free chlorine in the feed water were altered a complete presentation of these experimental results are described in previous publications of our group dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 dashtban kenari et al 2017 in the first step of modeling a set of lab scale results were employed to obtain the oxidation rate constant by fitting the model output to the experimental data this selection was made as the characteristics of synthetic groundwater were well known and the chlorine demand within the bed under this condition was solely associated with the oxidation of adsorbed mn ii this strategy was also justified by the experimental observation that a solution oxidation of mn ii within the pfb did not occur for this set of tests dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 the resultant k r value was then utilized for the rest of model development validation and application activities the same set of experimental data was simultaneously employed to obtain the best k f and d s values by matching the model simulations with the experimental data the k f value was determined by fitting the model simulation to the mn ii concentration profile at the initial stage of each experiment after 1 h operation as explained in section 4 2 the optimal k f value for each experiment was unique regardless of k r and d s values the d s value was then determined such that to let the model to best represent the mn ii concentration profiles throughout the operation fig 2 shows the comparison between the model simulations and lab scale experimental data it illustrates that the simulated mn ii profiles over 12 days agreed very well with the experimental profiles two border lines drawn around the ideal line model experiment in fig 2b demonstrate that the model simulations are within 10 error relative to the experimental data fitted values for k r k f and d s were 2 0 10 5 m3 mol 1 s 1 1 0 10 5 m s 1 and 5 5 10 8 m2 s 1 respectively a series of experimentally observed mn ii concentration profiles within the field pilot scale pfb contactor were compared with the model simulations in figs 3 5 under various feed water mn ii concentrations and hlrs they were adopted for the purpose of model development i e to obtain the best k f and d s values under the conditions explored here as shown in these figures the developed model can effectively simulate the experimental data within less than 20 relative error the best fitted values of k r k f and d s under different conditions are presented in table 6 it indicates that the fitted values for k f and d s obtained by modeling the lab and field pilot scale pfb contactors at relatively constant hlrs 40 45 m h 1 ranged from 4 0 10 8 to 7 0 10 8 m2 s 1 and 1 0 10 5 to 1 3 10 5 m s 1 respectively the narrow range attained for these parameters implies that the fitted values under various mn ii and chlorine concentrations as well as different pfb column sizes utilized for this research are quite similar which attests the robustness of the developed model accordingly average values of these parameters i e d s 5 5 10 8 m2 s 1 and k f 1 2 10 5 m s 1 were subsequently applied in the developed model to simulate the in bed mn ii profile and breakthrough time under specific conditions it is worthwhile noting that although free chlorine was continuously injected into the influent for continuous regeneration of the pyrolusite media breakthrough may still occur requiring further regeneration of the filter media this is related to the much higher adsorption rate of mn ii onto the pyrolusite surface compared to the oxidation rate of adsorbed mn ii by free chlorine in this regard the importance of free chlorine concentration which can compensate the lower oxidation rate is extensively explained in the last section for the purpose of model validation the average values of k f and d s together with relevant values for the other parameters were adopted in the developed model to compare its prediction performance with respect to two sets of experimental data from the lab and field pilot scale tests the collected experimental data during tests 1 ls and 3 fp on different days than those already utilized for the model development were employed for the model validation fig 6 illustrates the results of the performance evaluation for days 1 3 5 7 9 and 11 of test 1 ls fig 7 represents the same evaluation for days 4 9 and 12 of test 3 fp figs 6b and 7b show that the developed model can accurately simulate the experimental data from both the lab and field pilot scales within less than 10 relative error these observations indicate that the developed model is robust under different conditions and scales explored in this study although the model was validated with experimental data up to the pilot scale it can be adopted to acquire operational insights at larger scales with the recommendations made here for the critical model parameters a validation of the above statement with the help of experimental data collected in a larger pfb contactor as a future study will certify the application of the model at larger scales 4 2 sensitivity analysis upon validating the developed model a series of sensitivity analyses were performed with respect to the reference cases to acquire detailed insight about the mn ii removal process by a pfb contactor a set of operating conditions at the beginning 1 h of operation and the end 12 days of operation of test 1 ls were applied as the reference conditions to assess the sensitivity of the developed model to its important parameters i e k r k f k n d l and d s each parameter was varied by 50 while keeping the rest of the parameters constant at their reference values the simulated mn ii concentration profiles are illustrated in figs 8 13 figs 8 and 9 show that the mn ii concentration profiles and in turn the breakthrough time are significantly influenced by mn ii adsorption onto the media surface and hence are substantially sensitive to the freundlich parameters k and n fig 10 demonstrates that altering the solid phase axial dispersion coefficient affects the curvature of mn ii concentration profile at the later stages of operation particularly in the initial 60 cm of the bed height while it minimally impacts the breakthrough time although increasing d s by 500 with respect to the reference value results are not shown here enhanced the deviation between the evaluating and reference mn ii concentration profiles within the bed it led to the same drift for the breakthrough time this dependency between the breakthrough time and d s confirms that the application of a mean fitted value for d s in the developed model provides acceptable results at conditions close to those explored here fig 11 shows that variation in the liquid phase axial dispersion coefficient has a negligible influence on the mn ii concentration profile along the bed height and the breakthrough time veeraraghavan and fan 1989 reported that when the ratio of bed height to particle diameter exceeds 50 the variation in d l minimally influenced the effluent concentration of phenol stream in a fluidized bed contactor designed for adsorption of phenol by granular activated carbon the conditions explored in this study h d p and the findings reported here are in broad agreement with the results of veeraraghavan and fan 1989 fig 12 shows that the oxidation rate constant has a discernible impact on the mn ii concentration profile at the later stages of operation this can be explained by an increased number of occupied sorption sites over the operation time and the vital regeneration of these sites for further progression of the process the influence of a change in the liquid to solid mass transfer coefficient on the mn ii concentration profile is illustrated in fig 13 different from other parameters as investigated in figs 8 12 k f has a greater influence on the mn ii concentration profile at the initial stage of the process rather than the later stages this dependency could be anticipated due to the high concentration gradient between the bulk and media surface and the large number of available adsorption sites at the initial stage of the process accordingly the k f value adopted for the modeling of each set of experimental data as listed in table 6 was determined by fitting the model simulation to the mn ii concentration profile at the initial stage of corresponding operation test 4 3 example of model application in order to demonstrate the applicability of the developed model it was employed to simulate the mn ii concentration profile and the breakthrough time under a specific condition and various free chlorine residuals these results also address the influences of free chlorine concentration on the performance of the pfb contactor i e mn ii concentration in the effluent below the target level and the stability of the process i e rate of achieving the steady state condition for this simulation trial the mn ii concentration ph and temperature of the feed water and the operation hlr were assumed to be 0 5 mg l 1 7 0 9 c and 45 m h 1 respectively the simulation results under different free chlorine concentrations 1 0 2 8 and 3 5 mg cl2 l 1 are illustrated in fig 14 this figure depicts that the free chlorine concentration remarkably impacts the stability of the process and the breakthrough time by influencing the regeneration rate of the adsorption sites even though the stoichiometric chlorine demand 0 65 mg cl2 l 1 was met under all conditions accordingly the breakthrough was reached after 17 figs 14a and 35 fig 14b days when the concentration of free chlorine in the raw water varied from 1 0 to 2 8 mg cl2 l 1 this is while a steady state mn ii control without requiring further regeneration was achieved at a free chlorine concentration of 3 5 mg cl2 l 1 fig 14c in accordance with this observation the experimental results reported in an earlier publication of the group dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 revealed that the free chlorine concentration substantially affects the mn ii removal performance of the pfb contactor through altering the breakthrough time according to fig 14c after 30 days of operation the process reached the steady state condition and the simulated mn ii concentration profiles overlapped these results also indicate that contrary with knocke et al 1990a maintaining the residual free chlorine concentration of 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 in the effluent does not necessarily fulfill the continuous regeneration of the adsorption sites this might be attributed to the high concentration of mn ii up to 0 8 mg l 1 in the feed water and very low contact time 1 min within the pfb contactor this model can be further applied to determine the bed inventory and operating time needed to achieve steady state under specific operating conditions including the influent mn ii and free chlorine concentrations hlr ph and temperature for instance fig 14c shows that under the selected operating conditions a bed inventory corresponding to an expanded bed height of about 0 85 m is needed to achieve steady state removal of manganese below the target level 5 conclusions this study for the first time presents a dynamic mechanistic model to describe mn ii removal from groundwater within a pfb contactor the model represented both lab scale and field pilot scale experimental results within less than 20 relative error under a wide range of feed mn ii and free chlorine concentrations as well as hlr implying the robustness of the developed model the mn ii concentration profiles and in turn the breakthrough time are primarily sensitive to the freundlich isotherm constants and oxidation rate constant the liquid to solid mass transfer coefficient only has a minimal impact on breakthrough time these results further imply that oxidation of adsorbed mn ii by free chlorine is the limiting factor in this process the application of this model will offer invaluable benefits in either the performance evaluation improvement of a pfb contactor or in providing the most efficient and robust design of these units based on the available groundwater characteristics the developed model could also simulate the mn ii removal within a packed bed under different conditions if the axial solid phase dispersion coefficient is equated to zero and proper values for the axial liquid phase dispersion and mass transfer coefficients based on the packed bed flowrate are employed in the general mass balance equations acknowledgements the authors are grateful for the financial support of the natural sciences and

18970,a novel pyrolusite fluidized bed pfb contactor which we recently developed for dissolved manganese mn ii removal through surface adsorption and subsequent oxidation by free chlorine was modeled in this study the hydrodynamic behavior of the filter media and water in the fluidized bed was described by the axial dispersion model the model incorporated the effects of axial mixing in the liquid and solid phases mass transfer resistance in a laminar fluid boundary layer surrounding a media grain and a second order oxidation rate expression the experimental data from lab scale and field pilot scale contactors was adopted for the model development and its validation for the former the data was employed to estimate the oxidation rate constant the mass transfer coefficient and the axial solid phase dispersion coefficient for the model the model simulations matched the experimental data with less than 20 error across a wide range of mn ii and free chlorine concentrations and hydraulic loading rates that might be encountered in a drinking water treatment plant the sensitivity analysis showed that the time to breakthrough is most sensitive to the adsorption isotherm constants and the oxidation rate constant these observations indicate that the alluded parameters mainly control the performance of the pfb contactor as well as the process stability finally a sample application of the model to acquire operational inputs was illustrated by analyzing the effect of free chlorine concentration on mn ii removal performance and breakthrough time within a pfb contactor graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water manganese removal pyrolusite fluidized bed contactor modeling breakthrough 1 introduction soluble manganese mn ii naturally occurs in groundwater and anoxic hypolimnion

for mn ii adsorption the maintenance of available sorption sites which is mainly governed by free chlorine concentration is crucial for the continuous operation of this process knocke et al 1990a dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 even though knocke et al 1990a stated that a continuous regeneration of the adsorption sites can be achieved by maintaining the residual free chlorine concentration of 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 in the effluent recent studies revealed that stable mn ii removal from water with high mn ii concentrations 0 3 mg l 1 requires much higher residual free chlorine in the effluent to fulfill the continuous regeneration of the adsorption sites and hence the stable mn ii removal dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 dashtban kenari et al 2017 this is especially important for mn ii removal under low water temperatures a packed bed adsorption configuration has been traditionally chosen for mn ii control by nge process nonetheless several problems such as excessive head loss

experimentally however credible information is required for the design scale up and performance evaluation of these contactors under various operating conditions while the cost risk and endeavors required to experimentally explore all conditions scenarios cannot be justified the availability of an accurate model for pfb contactor can offer invaluable benefits merkle et al 1997 and bierlein et al 2015 developed a phenomenological model for mn ii removal in a packed bed contactor under low hlrs 6 24 m h 1 and high hlrs 40 60 m h 1 employing large media grains 1 5 2 0 mm respectively with low mn ii levels in the feed water the model by bierlein et al 2015 only focused on steady state condition due to the low concentration of mn ii 0 2 mg l 1 in the feed water and relatively high free chlorine concentrations 1 3 1 4 mg l 1 which provided continuous regeneration of the filter media in this regard developing a model which can simulate mn ii removal profile and breakthrough time i e the operating time at which the effluent mn ii concentration exceeds the target level under high mn ii concentrations up to 0 8 mg l 1 and hlrs up to 45 m h 1 as well as various chlorine concentrations is of great importance to the authors knowledge there are no models available in the open literature that can simulate the mn ii removal performance in a pfb contactor the current study aimed at developing a phenomenological model that can simulate the mn ii removal profile by nge process and the breakthrough time in a fluidized bed contactor containing pyrolusite media the developed model was initially validated by experimental data the critical parameters of this process were then identified with the help of the developed model through a series of sensitivity analyses eventually an example of the model application is illustrated by altering the free chlorine concentration under a specific condition and analyzing its impact on mn ii control and breakthrough time within a pfb contactor 2 contactor model the pyrolusite fluidized bed contactor was modeled as a continuum of uniformly dispersed particles in water for an expanded bed height h inspired by the previous models that were developed for a packed bed contactor merkle et al 1997 bierlein et al 2015 the development of the current model begins with the mass balance of mn ii in the bulk and adsorbed phase on the surface of the media and a mass balance of bulk chlorine across an incremental height of the media in the fluidized bed contactor this is schematically shown in fig 1 the equations of the present model have been derived based on the following simplifying assumptions 1 pyrolusite is of uniform particle size equal to the median size of the distribution 2 the lateral concentration gradients are negligible for both mn ii and free chlorine in the liquid phase of the column 3 the adsorption process is rapid so that a local equilibrium is achieved at the pyrolusite surface between the mn ii concentrations at the liquid solid interface and the adsorbed phase 4 adsorption of mn ii onto the pyrolusite surface can be represented by a freundlich isotherm over the concentrations applied in this study zuravnsky 2006 bierlein et al 2015 5 adsorption and surface oxidation occur on the external surface of the pyrolusite grains bierlein et al 2015 6 the adsorption rate is limited by the mass transfer resistance in the laminar fluid boundary layer surrounding a pyrolusite grain the mass transfer rate is controlled by both a mass transfer coefficient which mainly depends on fluid velocity and a mn ii concentration gradient from bulk to surface that exists owing to the rate of oxidation of sorbed mn ii that keeps regenerating sorption sites 7 thermal effects are negligible indicating isothermal adsorption of mn ii from dilute solution 8 the concentration of chlorine in the boundary layer of water surrounding the pyrolusite media is equal to the chlorine concentration in the bulk water i e the mass transfer of free chlorine in the boundary layer is negligible because an excess chlorine concentration of at least 1 mg l 1 was always present along the contactor height one must note that if an excess bulk chlorine concentration is not satisfied the mass transfer of free chlorine in the boundary layer must be included in the model 9 additional species that might interfere with adsorption or oxidation are not present and the size of pyrolusite grain remains constant over the course of operation 10 the hydrodynamic behavior of the pyrolusite grains and water in the fluidized bed can be described by the axial dispersion model veeraraghavan and fan 1989 li et al 2005 to represent the random movements of solid grains and liquid molecules along the bulk flow path such random movements give rise to deviations from the average velocity the binary collision between particles and granule wall collisions as well as the mutual interaction between the local fluid flow and particles yield solid dispersion in a liquid solid fluidized bed the soluble manganese removal process is modeled by advection and axial dispersion of liquid within the fluidized bed followed by mass transfer through the boundary layer surrounding the pyrolusite grains the adsorbed mn ii on the pyrolusite media can then be oxidized by the free chlorine i e regeneration of the adsorption sites the mass balance for the free chlorine in the bulk solution can be described by advection axial dispersion of liquid and oxidation reaction of free chlorine with adsorbed mn ii the mass balance of adsorbed mn ii consists of its adsorption onto the media surface oxidation by free chlorine and an axial mixing in the solid phase the degree of axial mixing of the fluidizing liquid and fluidized particles in the bed are expressed by the corresponding dispersion coefficients d l and d s respectively the mass balance equations for mn ii eq 1 and free chlorine eq 2 in the bulk water as well as adsorbed phase mn ii eq 3 on the surface of pyrolusite media were subsequently derived based on the above assumptions and conceptual explanations mentioned here the adopted variables in these equations and their definitions are listed in table 1 the mass balance equation for mn ii in the bulk water is given as follows 1 c m n b t u ε e c m n b z d l 2 c m n b z 2 a v k f 1 ε e ε e c m n b

solved using an implicit finite difference technique constandtinides and mostoufi 1999 the model was coded in matlab r2015a freundlich isotherm constantans k and n were determined experimentally in this regard short term mn ii adsorption capacity of pyrolusite was determined under each specific ph and temperature by a 4 h recycle method developed by tobiason et al 2008 at the initial stage of modeling the values of all independent parameters except the oxidation rate constant k r were adjusted based on the available empirical correlations as outlined in table 2 however as appropriate simulation performance was not achieved when adopting these estimated values in the model and comparing the model output with the experimental data the proper values of critical parameters were obtained through a fitting process in this regard k r k f and d s values were adjusted by fitting the model output to a set of lab and field pilot scale experimental data mn ii concentration profile within the pfb and free chlorine consumption the accuracy of the adjusted parameters in the developed model were then validated by comparing the simulated mn ii removal profiles with other sets of lab and field pilot scale experimental data these will be discussed in more details in section 4 1 3 experimental the experimental data that was applied to determine and validate the model parameters are selective results from lab and field pilot scale tests which are briefly explained in the following sections 3 1 lab scale tests in order to determine the oxidation rate constant the model simulation was fitted to a set of experimental results obtained from a lab scale pfb contactor for mn ii removal from a synthetic groundwater the characteristics of the synthetic water are listed in table 3 the experimental facility was located in credeau laboratories at polytechnique montréal the pfb column had an inner diameter of 2 54 cm 1 in and a length of 2 5 m which was filled up to 1 0 m with a commercially available pyrolusite media table 4 each experiment was conducted for a period of 12 days to determine the long term performance of the pfb for mn ii removal during these trials 400 l of synthetic groundwater which was renewed every four days was prepared and fed to the column a diluted bleach solution 500 mg cl2 l 1 was continuously injected into the water prior entering the column in order to determine the mn ii concentration profile within the pfb contactor the total and dissolved manganese concentrations filterable through a 0 45 μm millipore filter cat no hawp02500 were measured at different sampling points along the bed height 0 5 17 5 25 50 75 100 and 110 cm from the mesh screen located at the bottom of the column at the end of each experiment the bed was expanded to around 50 for 10 min followed by an overnight regeneration of the media with 8 l of recirculating chlorine solution 100 mg cl2 l 1 a detailed description of the lab scale experimental facility was expressed elsewhere dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 3 2 field pilot scale tests the experimental data obtained by a field pilot scale pfb contactor for mn ii removal from a natural groundwater was adopted to adjust the model s critical parameters and validate the model the pilot plant was placed at a groundwater treatment facility in sainte marthe sur le lac quebec canada the characteristics of the natural groundwater are listed in table 5 the pfb column was made of a clear polyvinyl chloride pipe with 2 5 m length and 15 2 cm 6 in inner diameter it was filled to 90 cm with the commercially available pyrolusite media table 4 the natural groundwater was fed to the column at a flow rate of 30 45 m h 1 12 18 gpm ft 2 yielding a bed expansion of 10 20 in order to continuously regenerate the media a commercial bleach solution 4 w v cl2 l 1 was injected into the water before entering the column to reach 1 4 mg cl2 l 1 chlorine residual in the influent water samples were taken at the inlet distributor level and 7 5 15 30 60 100 and 110 cm above the distributor both total and dissolved manganese concentrations filterable through a 0 45 μm syringe filter pvdf cat no cs glpv3045 were measured at each sampling point over a 21 day of experimental period for each condition in order to effectively remove the loosely attached particles from the media the pfb was expended to 40 for 20 min at the end of each experiment afterwards the media was completely regenerated with recirculating a 50 l diluted bleach solution 1 w v cl2 l 1 for 24 h to maintain an identical condition for all experiments while applying the same pyrolusite media in the column a detailed description of the field scale pilot plant can be obtained elsewhere dashtban kenari et al 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 model development and validation four representative set of results from the long term lab and field pilot scale studies were adopted to develop and validate the mechanistic model for mn ii removal within the pfb contactor all experiments were conducted at 9 1 c whereas the hlr concentration of mn ii or free chlorine in the feed water were altered a complete presentation of these experimental results are described in previous publications of our group dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 dashtban kenari et al 2017 in the first step of modeling a set of lab scale results were employed to obtain the oxidation rate constant by fitting the model output to the experimental data this selection was made as the characteristics of synthetic groundwater were well known and the chlorine demand within the bed under this condition was solely associated with the oxidation of adsorbed mn ii this strategy was also justified by the experimental observation that a solution oxidation of mn ii within the pfb did not occur for this set of tests dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 the resultant k r value was then utilized for the rest of model development validation and application activities the same set of experimental data was simultaneously employed to obtain the best k f and d s values by matching the model simulations with the experimental data the k f value was determined by fitting the model simulation to the mn ii concentration profile at the initial stage of each experiment after 1 h operation as explained in section 4 2 the optimal k f value for each experiment was unique regardless of k r and d s values the d s value was then determined such that to let the model to best represent the mn ii concentration profiles throughout the operation fig 2 shows the comparison between the model simulations and lab scale experimental data it illustrates that the simulated mn ii profiles over 12 days agreed very well with the experimental profiles two border lines drawn around the ideal line model experiment in fig 2b demonstrate that the model simulations are within 10 error relative to the experimental data fitted values for k r k f and d s were 2 0 10 5 m3 mol 1 s 1 1 0 10 5 m s 1 and 5 5 10 8 m2 s 1 respectively a series of experimentally observed mn ii concentration profiles within the field pilot scale pfb contactor were compared with the model simulations in figs 3 5 under various feed water mn ii concentrations and hlrs they were adopted for the purpose of model development i e to obtain the best k f and d s values under the conditions explored here as shown in these figures the developed model can effectively simulate the experimental data within less than 20 relative error the best fitted values of k r k f and d s under different conditions are presented in table 6 it indicates that the fitted values for k f and d s obtained by modeling the lab and field pilot scale pfb contactors at relatively constant hlrs 40 45 m h 1 ranged from 4 0 10 8 to 7 0 10 8 m2 s 1 and 1 0 10 5 to 1 3 10 5 m s 1 respectively the narrow range attained for these parameters implies that the fitted values under various mn ii and chlorine concentrations as well as different pfb column sizes utilized for this research are quite similar which attests the robustness of the developed model accordingly average values of these parameters i e d s 5 5 10 8 m2 s 1 and k f 1 2 10 5 m s 1 were subsequently applied in the developed model to simulate the in bed mn ii profile and breakthrough time under specific conditions it is worthwhile noting that although free chlorine was continuously injected into the influent for continuous regeneration of the pyrolusite media breakthrough may still occur requiring further regeneration of the filter media this is related to the much higher adsorption rate of mn ii onto the pyrolusite surface compared to the oxidation rate of adsorbed mn ii by free chlorine in this regard the importance of free chlorine concentration which can compensate the lower oxidation rate is extensively explained in the last section for the purpose of model validation the average values of k f and d s together with relevant values for the other parameters were adopted in the developed model to compare its prediction performance with respect to two sets of experimental data from the lab and field pilot scale tests the collected experimental data during tests 1 ls and 3 fp on different days than those already utilized for the model development were employed for the model validation fig 6 illustrates the results of the performance evaluation for days 1 3 5 7 9 and 11 of test 1 ls fig 7 represents the same evaluation for days 4 9 and 12 of test 3 fp figs 6b and 7b show that the developed model can accurately simulate the experimental data from both the lab and field pilot scales within less than 10 relative error these observations indicate that the developed model is robust under different conditions and scales explored in this study although the model was validated with experimental data up to the pilot scale it can be adopted to acquire operational insights at larger scales with the recommendations made here for the critical model parameters a validation of the above statement with the help of experimental data collected in a larger pfb contactor as a future study will certify the application of the model at larger scales 4 2 sensitivity analysis upon validating the developed model a series of sensitivity analyses were performed with respect to the reference cases to acquire detailed insight about the mn ii removal process by a pfb contactor a set of operating conditions at the beginning 1 h of operation and the end 12 days of operation of test 1 ls were applied as the reference conditions to assess the sensitivity of the developed model to its important parameters i e k r k f k n d l and d s each parameter was varied by 50 while keeping the rest of the parameters constant at their reference values the simulated mn ii concentration profiles are illustrated in figs 8 13 figs 8 and 9 show that the mn ii concentration profiles and in turn the breakthrough time are significantly influenced by mn ii adsorption onto the media surface and hence are substantially sensitive to the freundlich parameters k and n fig 10 demonstrates that altering the solid phase axial dispersion coefficient affects the curvature of mn ii concentration profile at the later stages of operation particularly in the initial 60 cm of the bed height while it minimally impacts the breakthrough time although increasing d s by 500 with respect to the reference value results are not shown here enhanced the deviation between the evaluating and reference mn ii concentration profiles within the bed it led to the same drift for the breakthrough time this dependency between the breakthrough time and d s confirms that the application of a mean fitted value for d s in the developed model provides acceptable results at conditions close to those explored here fig 11 shows that variation in the liquid phase axial dispersion coefficient has a negligible influence on the mn ii concentration profile along the bed height and the breakthrough time veeraraghavan and fan 1989 reported that when the ratio of bed height to particle diameter exceeds 50 the variation in d l minimally influenced the effluent concentration of phenol stream in a fluidized bed contactor designed for adsorption of phenol by granular activated carbon the conditions explored in this study h d p and the findings reported here are in broad agreement with the results of veeraraghavan and fan 1989 fig 12 shows that the oxidation rate constant has a discernible impact on the mn ii concentration profile at the later stages of operation this can be explained by an increased number of occupied sorption sites over the operation time and the vital regeneration of these sites for further progression of the process the influence of a change in the liquid to solid mass transfer coefficient on the mn ii concentration profile is illustrated in fig 13 different from other parameters as investigated in figs 8 12 k f has a greater influence on the mn ii concentration profile at the initial stage of the process rather than the later stages this dependency could be anticipated due to the high concentration gradient between the bulk and media surface and the large number of available adsorption sites at the initial stage of the process accordingly the k f value adopted for the modeling of each set of experimental data as listed in table 6 was determined by fitting the model simulation to the mn ii concentration profile at the initial stage of corresponding operation test 4 3 example of model application in order to demonstrate the applicability of the developed model it was employed to simulate the mn ii concentration profile and the breakthrough time under a specific condition and various free chlorine residuals these results also address the influences of free chlorine concentration on the performance of the pfb contactor i e mn ii concentration in the effluent below the target level and the stability of the process i e rate of achieving the steady state condition for this simulation trial the mn ii concentration ph and temperature of the feed water and the operation hlr were assumed to be 0 5 mg l 1 7 0 9 c and 45 m h 1 respectively the simulation results under different free chlorine concentrations 1 0 2 8 and 3 5 mg cl2 l 1 are illustrated in fig 14 this figure depicts that the free chlorine concentration remarkably impacts the stability of the process and the breakthrough time by influencing the regeneration rate of the adsorption sites even though the stoichiometric chlorine demand 0 65 mg cl2 l 1 was met under all conditions accordingly the breakthrough was reached after 17 figs 14a and 35 fig 14b days when the concentration of free chlorine in the raw water varied from 1 0 to 2 8 mg cl2 l 1 this is while a steady state mn ii control without requiring further regeneration was achieved at a free chlorine concentration of 3 5 mg cl2 l 1 fig 14c in accordance with this observation the experimental results reported in an earlier publication of the group dashtban kenari and barbeau 2014 revealed that the free chlorine concentration substantially affects the mn ii removal performance of the pfb contactor through altering the breakthrough time according to fig 14c after 30 days of operation the process reached the steady state condition and the simulated mn ii concentration profiles overlapped these results also indicate that contrary with knocke et al 1990a maintaining the residual free chlorine concentration of 0 5 1 0 mg l 1 in the effluent does not necessarily fulfill the continuous regeneration of the adsorption sites this might be attributed to the high concentration of mn ii up to 0 8 mg l 1 in the feed water and very low contact time 1 min within the pfb contactor this model can be further applied to determine the bed inventory and operating time needed to achieve steady state under specific operating conditions including the influent mn ii and free chlorine concentrations hlr ph and temperature for instance fig 14c shows that under the selected operating conditions a bed inventory corresponding to an expanded bed height of about 0 85 m is needed to achieve steady state removal of manganese below the target level 5 conclusions this study for the first time presents a dynamic mechanistic model to describe mn ii removal from groundwater within a pfb contactor the model represented both lab scale and field pilot scale experimental results within less than 20 relative error under a wide range of feed mn ii and free chlorine concentrations as well as hlr implying the robustness of the developed model the mn ii concentration profiles and in turn the breakthrough time are primarily sensitive to the freundlich isotherm constants and oxidation rate constant the liquid to solid mass transfer coefficient only has a minimal impact on breakthrough time these results further imply that oxidation of adsorbed mn ii by free chlorine is the limiting factor in this process the application of this model will offer invaluable benefits in either the performance evaluation improvement of a pfb contactor or in providing the most efficient and robust design of these units based on the available groundwater characteristics the developed model could also simulate the mn ii removal within a packed bed under different conditions if the axial solid phase dispersion coefficient is equated to zero and proper values for the axial liquid phase dispersion and mass transfer

18971,phosphorus is a critical element determining trophic status and chlorophyll a chl a level in natural lakes and reservoirs and total phosphorus tp concentrations can be predicted from data on phosphorus loading hydraulic flushing rate and sedimentation due to their interactions with phosphorus iron hydr oxides in suspended particles originally derived from watershed soil can strongly influence the phosphorus sedimentation and phosphorus bioavailability in water columns thus the tp precipitation relationship and the response of chl a to tp are likely associated with watersheds soil iron to test this assumption we built hierarchical linear models for summer observation of natural lakes and reservoirs across a large geographic gradient the intercepts and slopes of tp precipitation relationships are higher in natural lakes than those in reservoirs and these model coefficients exhibit latitudinal variations that are explained by the natural soil iron gradient soil iron operating at a regional level significantly mediates the effect of precipitation on tp concentration in both natural lakes and reservoirs and drives the latitudinal variation in the chl a tp relationships for reservoirs our results imply that the increase in extreme precipitation events anticipated under future climate conditions may substantially mitigate eutrophication in tropical and subtropical reservoirs but may worsen conditions in temperate lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus chlorophyll a soil iron regional scale hierarchical model 1 introduction phosphorus is the common limiting nutrient for aquatic primary production and its concentration is usually used as an indicator for evaluating the trophic status and water quality of natural lakes and artificial lakes reservoirs edmondson 1970 schindler 1974 identifying the cause of phosphorus concentration variations in lakes can improve our ability to anticipate the effectiveness of management practices schindler 2006 tp concentrations in lakes are closely associated with precipitation dillon 1975 jones and bachmann 1976 chapra and tarapchak 1976 mosley 2015 an intensive precipitation can induce a strong runoff and subsequently increase the input of soil particles and external phosphorus to lakes carpenter et al 1998 ekholm and lehtoranta 2012 however intensive precipitation could reduce hydraulic retention time and facilitate water exchange and may dilute the phosphorus in water columns in addition the sedimentation of particulate phosphorus also brings about a decrease in tp concentration in water columns thus the effect of precipitation on tp concentration in water columns not only depends on phosphorus loading but also on flushing out and sedimentation due to the difference in nutrient input and limnological factors between natural lakes and reservoirs straškraba 1996 doubek and carey 2017 these two lake types might have distinct tp precipitation relationships simple empirical models have been developed to predict tp concentrations in both natural lakes and reservoirs from data on phosphorus loading hydraulic flushing rates and sedimentation vollenweider 1975 jones and bachmann 1976 although such models often have favorable goodness of fit statistics there is still a high unexplained variance kalff 2002 which greatly depends on how well the phosphorus sedimentation is estimated by examining the phosphorus input output relationships of a large number of natural and artificial lakes canfield and bachmann 1981 gave a statistical estimate for the sedimentation coefficient because of the input dependence of phosphorus loading their estimate implicitly shows that phosphorus sedimentation is critical for tp precipitation relationships of lakes and reservoirs iron hydr oxides are involved in phosphorus sedimentation in lakes in which phosphorus sorption desorption and co precipitation dissolution react on the interface between iron hydr oxides and water phase boström et al 1988 holtan et al 1988 slomp et al 1996 hongve 1997 ruttenberg 2003 suspended particle and surface sediment can be both a sink and a source of phosphorus in water columns depending on the sedimentation resuspension equilibrium jensen et al 1992 forsgren et al 1996 koski vähälä and hartikainen 2000 søndergaard et al 2003 hoffman et al 2013 iron hydr oxides in water columns and in sediments are ultimately derived from catchment soil dillon and molot 2005 soil iron content which has a regional pattern connected to climate conditions and geology buol et al 2011 therefore determines the iron content in suspended particles and sediments which can influence tp concentration in water columns hence precipitation has a potential to mediate tp concentration by soil iron phosphorus concentration determines chl a level to a great extent in aquatic ecosystems schindler 1974 schindler 2006 the chl a tp relationships have been extensively examined and the regression models reflect the response of phytoplankton to phosphorus and the phosphorus utilization efficiency in lakes and reservoirs dillon and rigler 1974 vollenweider and kerekes 1980 prairie et al 1989 filstrup et al 2014 because iron hydro oxides may strongly influence tp concentrations and modify the bioavailable proportion of tp in water columns hoyer and jones 1983 caraco et al 1990 håkanson et al 2005 the intercepts and slopes of chl a tp regression models for natural lakes and reservoirs may be affected indirectly by soil iron at regional level compared to reservoirs natural lakes typically have higher p loadings but smaller watershed consequently the effect of soil iron on the chl a tp relationship is expected to be lesser for lakes than that for reservoirs thus we predict that soil iron is able to explain the regional variation in chl a tp relationships but depending on lake type to test whether tp precipitation and chl a tp relationships in lakes and reservoirs are mediated by soil iron at the regional scale we investigated 38 reservoirs in southern china and collected data from published works on 77 lakes and 74 reservoirs throughout china the data set was divided into 12 groups based on region large river basins topography or soil iron and lake type natural lake or reservoir we used a multilevel hierarchical modeling approach to analyze such structural data with soil iron as a regional variable 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we compiled a data set that encompassed tp and chl a concentration data of 77 lakes 196 observations and 112 reservoirs 268 observations in china the data were obtained from our field investigation in southern china 36 reservoirs and the published literature in cnki http www cnki net and isi web of science the basic information for each lake reservoir and the reference of our data were shown in supplementary material csv file these lakes and reservoirs cover a broad latitudinal range from tropical to temperate regions fig 1 brackish lakes and coastal lakes potentially affected by salt tide were excluded artificial scenic lakes were classified as natural lakes because of their similarities to natural lakes only summer june july and august observations were included in our dataset there were repeated observations for 35 lakes and 53 reservoirs here each observation corresponds to a single sampling occasion and reflects the monthly average value all samples were taken from the epilimnion in the pelagic zone of water bodies during 2000 2014 tp concentration in our dataset was determined according

similarity of soil characteristic lakes in zhejiang province were included in the yangzi river basin and lakes in east and west of guangdong province were included in the pearl river basin data on tp and chl a concentration from natural lakes in sichuan basin and guizhou plateau were not available consequently there are only 5 groups of natural lakes compared to 7 groups of reservoirs table 1 shows the morphological parameters lake depth surface area and volume number of sampling sites one site refers to a single lake or reservoir and number of observations for each group of lakes the regional average iron content in soil was calculated based on provincial average values reported by wei et al 1990 soil samples were digested by nitric acid and perchloric acid and iron was measured by icp aes inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry the background value of soil iron content is primary determined by geology and climate condition it is relatively stable and is less affected by human activity the reported data of soil iron dated back to 1990 is similar to the contemporary soil iron content during 2000 and 2014 in our study the monthly air temperature and precipitation were obtained from government statistical yearbooks http nianjian cnki net data on chl a tp soil iron air temperature and precipitation for each group of lakes are summarized in table 2 2 2 multilevel hierarchical modeling exploratory analysis of the data fig s1 and table s1 fig s2 and table s2 shows the difference in tp precipitation and chl a tp relationships among 12 groups by grouping lakes reservoirs we introduce a hierarchical structure into the data observations nested with each lake lakes nested in individual groups and so on because of the imbalance in sample sizes number of observations in each lake and number of lakes in each group multilevel hierarchical modeling approach is the most appropriate method for analyzing such data this approach is able to link individual observations with group level variables and make the statistical inference based on two pieces of information group means and overall mean malve and qian 2006 qian 2017 a log log linear model is used as the basic model form for both tp precipitation and chl a tp relationships the log log linear regression represents a proportional change relationship between the response and the predictor qian 2017 pages 186 187 that is the model assumes an increase of 1 in the predictor variable will lead to a fixed percentage increase in the response variable this is a reasonable assumption when using the natural logarithm the fitted slope β or δ is the fixed percentage β or δ at the observational level we assume that the natural log transformed tp concentration can be modeled by a

than that in lakes lakes and reservoirs in yunnan plateau were deeper than the ones in other regions which shows low regional variation in mean depths table 1 average monthly precipitation showed a low regional variation table 2 tp and chl a concentrations among groups were highly variable with an overall average of 27 8 44 4 μg l and 91 1 162 1 μg l respectively table 2 the regional average soil iron content ranged from 2 83 to 5 22 the overall average summer air temperature was 24 2 3 5 c and there existed no latitudinal variation table 2 3 1 tp precipitation relationships reservoirs have significantly lower intercepts αjk of tp precipitation model than lakes fig 2 indicating that regional average tp concentration in reservoirs is lower than that in lakes when precipitation is similar for these two lake types the slopes βjk of tp precipitation model are negative for reservoirs below the red line in fig 2b but positive for lakes except in yunnan plateau l2 in fig 2 there was substantial regional variation in the parameters of tp precipitation regression models the intercepts and slopes shown a latitudinal pattern with relatively high values in temperate regions l5 l6 l7

subtropical regions than that in temperate regions fig 2b as suggested by the dic value and the between group standard deviance in group specific model coefficients table 3 soil iron is the variable that best explains the latitudinal pattern in the coefficients of tp precipitation regression model the estimated intercepts and slopes of tp precipitation regression models were negatively correlated

high values in tropical and subtropical reservoirs l1 l2 r1 r2 and r3 in fig 3 the indication is that chl a concentration at a given tp concentration tends to be higher and its response to tp variation is more sensitive in tropical and subtropical reservoirs than those in the temperate reservoirs the coefficients of chl a tp regression models for natural lakes were less variable among regions both soil iron and mean temperature can partially explain the regional variation in the coefficients of chl a tp regression models table 4 but only soil iron has a latitudinal pattern in our

a tp relationships the regional level soil iron content is positively correlated with the intercepts and slopes of chl a tp relationships in reservoirs fig 3 4 discussion precipitation promotes diffused phosphorus loss from watershed and has a profound influence on phosphorus dynamics in lakes carpenter et al 1998 our hierarchical tp precipitation model showed that natural lakes have higher intercepts and slopes of tp precipitation relationships than reservoirs this is likely because these natural lakes had higher phosphorus loadings reservoirs are usually more isolated and receive less nutrient input than natural lakes straškraba 1996 doubek and carey 2017 in addition this might be explained by the difference in depths between the two lake types lakes included in this study are shallow mean depth 6 m except for lakes in yunnan plateau table 1 these shallow lakes are at best weakly stratified in summer qin 2001 le et al 2010 and the mixing may increase the particulate phosphorus release from sediment james and barko 1993 kristensen et al 1992 reservoirs are generally deeper than natural lakes and usually exhibit strong stratification in wet seasons brooks and edgington 1994 wang et al 2012 doubek and carey 2017 which block the diffusion of phosphorus from hypolimnion to epilimnion in water columns furthermore deep water withdrawal in reservoirs lead to deeper thermoclines han et al 2000 unlike natural lakes reservoirs can discharge water through outlets at depths reaching phosphorus enriched hypolimnion wang et al 2011 2012 and may increase the flushing out of phosphorus barbiero et al 1997 overall sedimentation flux minus release flux from surface sediment is equal to the net sedimentation flux net sedimentation plus flushing out reflects the dilution effect of precipitation on tp concentration the negative slopes of tp precipitation models for reservoirs suggest that the dilution effect of precipitation to some extent surpasses the enrichment effect of tp loading on tp concentration in reservoirs fig 4 the positive slopes of tp precipitation models indicate that the enrichment effect of tp loading is greater than dilution effect of precipitation for natural lakes fig 4 the intercepts and slopes of our tp precipitation regression models are lower in sub tropical region than that in temperate region as there is no latitudinal gradient in the external loading of phosphorus for natural lakes and reservoirs in china zhang et al 2004 it suggests that tp loading is independent of climate zone in our study that is tp loading in south china is not significant different from that in northeast china and it is reasonable to assume that average tp loading is roughly the same for our lakes and reservoirs at the regional scale based upon this assumption it might be expected that the tp concentration pattern is attributed to the alteration of phosphorus sedimentation process occurring in the water columns not the variation in external phosphorus input tp loading probably play a minor role in determining the tp pattern tp concentrations in natural lakes and reservoirs with similar precipitation intercepts change as a function of soil iron content the effect of precipitation on tp concentrations slopes in both natural lakes and reservoirs are associated with iron content in catchment soil although phosphorus also interacts with other metal elements e g calcium manganese and aluminum dissolved organic carbon and carbonates iron acts as a carrier in natural waters van der grift et al 2018 compared with other elements in soil iron is more likely to strongly influence phosphorus sedimentation in lakes and reservoirs phosphorus sedimentation is usually coupled with iron in water columns hongve 1997 with an increasing gradient of soil iron from north to south we expect to see a more intensive net sedimentation sedimentation minus internal release of phosphorus in the water column fig 4 because of the strong phosphorus sorption and coprecipitation with iron hydr oxides and the subsequent sedimentation of iron phosphorus complexes stauffer 1987 gunnars et al 2002 hoffman et al 2013 iron hydroxyphosphate is the main chemical form of such iron phosphorus complexes baken et al 2016 van der grift et al 2016 the tp pattern we observed suggests that there would be a decreasing proportion of phosphorus in the water column and an increasing proportion of phosphorus in the sediment as we move from high to low latitudes in other words high soil iron may considerably counteract the effect of tp loading and thereby result in the relatively low tp concentration in subtropical lakes and reservoirs other factor such as temperature largely determines the formation of thermocline and influences the phosphorus flux in water columns kalff 2002 lakes and reservoirs in tropical and subtropical regions have no ice on season and have longer stratification period which might decrease to a larger degree the phosphorus diffusion from hypolimnion however the regional average temperature in our dataset do not substantially differ among climate zones this is probably because altitude also has an influence on temperature in summer and offsets the dependence of temperature on latitude therefore temperature may contribute less to the tp pattern in addition low ph increases the phosphorus binding capacity of iron in lakes boström et al 1988 and might change the phosphorus flux in water columns nevertheless no remarkable difference in average ph between tropical and temperate waters was reported so far the tp pattern could be less related to water ph our tp precipitation model has implications for the effect of climate change on lake tp concentration global climate change is expected to bring not only an increase in temperatures but also an increase in the frequency of flooding events khan et al 2015 mo et al 2016 the slopes of our tp precipitation model suggests that extreme precipitation can lead to an increase in tp concentration in temperate lakes but a decrease in tp concentration in reservoirs an intensive might decrease to a greater extent the tp concentration of reservoirs in tropical and subtropical regions than that in temperate regions contrary to the conventional wisdom soil erosion after intensive precipitation is likely to reduce the phosphorus concentration of reservoirs particularly in tropical and subtropical regions soil iron influences tp concentrations in water columns and alters the fraction of bioavailable phosphorus through chemical immobilization caraco et al 1990 håkanson et al 2005 both tp concentration and the bioavailable proportion of tp are related to the coefficients of chl a tp regression models hoyer and jones 1983 in the present study regional variation in the chl a tp relationships in reservoirs can be explained by the iron content in watershed soil because the intercept is the expected log chl a concentration when tp concentration is at the same level grand mean of the data a higher intercept suggests a higher phosphorus utilization efficiency i e the same level of tp leads to a higher chl a fig 3a a higher slope indicates that a lake is more sensitive to tp in other words high soil iron may enhance phosphorus limitation and drive the parameters of chl a tp regression model in reservoirs to increase from temperate to tropical and subtropical regions as natural lakes have higher tp concentrations than reservoirs the phosphorus limitation in lakes could be weaker this may explain why soil iron content has a lesser effect on the coefficients of regression model for natural lakes 5 conclusions soil iron can act as a critical variable at the regional scale for mediating the impact of precipitation on tp concentration in lakes and reservoirs this in turn drives the latitudinal variation in chl a tp relationship in reservoirs our study implies that the increase in extreme precipitation events anticipated under future climate conditions may substantially mitigate eutrophication in tropical and subtropical reservoirs but worsening the conditions in temperate lakes

18971,phosphorus is a critical element determining trophic status and chlorophyll a chl a level in natural lakes and reservoirs and total phosphorus tp concentrations can be predicted from data on phosphorus loading hydraulic flushing rate and sedimentation due to their interactions with phosphorus iron hydr oxides in suspended particles originally derived from watershed soil can strongly influence the phosphorus sedimentation and phosphorus bioavailability in water columns thus the tp precipitation relationship and the response of chl a to tp are likely associated with watersheds soil iron to test this assumption we built hierarchical linear models for summer observation of natural lakes and reservoirs across a large geographic gradient the intercepts and slopes of tp precipitation relationships are higher in natural lakes than those in reservoirs and these model coefficients exhibit latitudinal variations that are explained by the natural soil iron gradient soil iron operating at a regional level significantly mediates the effect of precipitation on tp concentration in both natural lakes and reservoirs and drives the latitudinal variation in the chl a tp relationships for reservoirs our results imply that the increase in extreme precipitation events anticipated under future climate conditions may substantially mitigate eutrophication in tropical and subtropical reservoirs but may worsen conditions in temperate lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus chlorophyll a soil iron regional scale hierarchical model 1 introduction phosphorus is the common limiting nutrient for aquatic primary production and its concentration is usually used as an indicator for evaluating the trophic status and water quality of natural lakes and artificial lakes reservoirs edmondson 1970 schindler 1974 identifying the cause of phosphorus concentration variations in lakes can improve our ability to anticipate the effectiveness of management practices schindler 2006 tp concentrations in lakes are closely associated with precipitation dillon 1975 jones and bachmann 1976 chapra and tarapchak 1976 mosley 2015 an intensive precipitation can induce a strong runoff and subsequently increase the input of soil particles and external phosphorus to lakes carpenter et al 1998 ekholm and lehtoranta 2012 however intensive precipitation could reduce hydraulic retention time and facilitate water exchange and may dilute the phosphorus in water columns in addition the sedimentation of particulate phosphorus also brings about a decrease in tp concentration in water columns thus the effect of precipitation on tp concentration in water columns not only depends on phosphorus loading but also on flushing out and sedimentation due to the difference in nutrient input and limnological factors between natural lakes and reservoirs straškraba 1996 doubek and carey 2017 these two lake types might have distinct tp precipitation relationships simple empirical models have been developed to predict tp concentrations in both natural lakes and reservoirs from data on phosphorus loading hydraulic flushing rates and sedimentation vollenweider 1975 jones and bachmann 1976 although such models often have favorable goodness of fit statistics there is still a high unexplained variance kalff 2002 which greatly depends on how well the phosphorus sedimentation is estimated by examining the phosphorus input output relationships of a large number of natural and artificial lakes canfield and bachmann 1981 gave a statistical estimate for the sedimentation coefficient because of the input dependence of phosphorus loading their estimate implicitly shows that phosphorus sedimentation is critical for tp precipitation relationships of lakes and reservoirs iron hydr oxides are involved in phosphorus sedimentation in lakes in which phosphorus sorption desorption and co precipitation dissolution react on the interface between iron hydr oxides and water phase boström et al 1988 holtan et al 1988 slomp et al 1996 hongve 1997 ruttenberg 2003 suspended particle and surface sediment can be both a sink and a source of phosphorus in water columns depending on the sedimentation resuspension equilibrium jensen et al 1992 forsgren et al 1996 koski vähälä and hartikainen 2000 søndergaard et al 2003 hoffman et al 2013 iron hydr oxides in water columns and in sediments are ultimately derived from catchment soil dillon and molot 2005 soil iron content which has a regional pattern connected to climate conditions and geology buol et al 2011 therefore determines the iron content in suspended particles and sediments which can influence tp concentration in water columns hence precipitation has a potential to mediate tp concentration by soil iron phosphorus concentration determines chl a level to a great extent in aquatic ecosystems schindler 1974 schindler 2006 the chl a tp relationships have been extensively examined and the regression models reflect the response of phytoplankton to phosphorus and the phosphorus utilization efficiency in lakes and reservoirs dillon and rigler 1974 vollenweider and kerekes 1980 prairie et al 1989 filstrup et al 2014 because iron hydro oxides may strongly influence tp concentrations and modify the bioavailable proportion of tp in water columns hoyer and jones 1983 caraco et al 1990 håkanson et al 2005 the intercepts and slopes of chl a tp regression models for natural lakes and reservoirs may be affected indirectly by soil iron at regional level compared to reservoirs natural lakes typically have higher p loadings but smaller watershed consequently the effect of soil iron on the chl a tp relationship is expected to be lesser for lakes than that for reservoirs thus we predict that soil iron is able to explain the regional variation in chl a tp relationships but depending on lake type to test whether tp precipitation and chl a tp relationships in lakes and reservoirs are mediated by soil iron at the regional scale we investigated 38 reservoirs in southern china and collected data from published works on 77 lakes and 74 reservoirs throughout china the data set was divided into 12 groups based on region large river basins topography or soil iron and lake type natural lake or reservoir we used a multilevel hierarchical modeling approach to analyze such structural data with soil iron as a regional variable 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we compiled a data set that encompassed tp and chl a concentration data of 77 lakes 196 observations and 112 reservoirs 268 observations in china the data were obtained from our field investigation in southern china 36 reservoirs and the published literature in cnki http www cnki net and isi web of science the basic information for each lake reservoir and the reference of our data were shown in supplementary material csv file these lakes and reservoirs cover a broad latitudinal range from tropical to temperate regions fig 1 brackish lakes and coastal lakes potentially affected by salt tide were excluded artificial scenic lakes were classified as natural lakes because of their similarities to natural lakes only summer june july and august observations were included in our dataset there were repeated observations for 35 lakes and 53 reservoirs here each observation corresponds to a single sampling occasion and reflects the monthly average value all samples were taken from the epilimnion in the pelagic zone of water bodies during 2000 2014 tp concentration in our dataset was determined according to standard methods for water quality apha 1989 chl a concentration was determined by spectrophotometric method after acetone or hot ethanol extraction jin and tu 1990 lin et al 2005 lakes were divided into 12 groups based on region and lake type table 1 seven regions were classified on the basis of large river basins topography or soil iron from north to south 1 songhuajiang river and liao river basin 2 hai river yellow river basin and huai river basin 3 middle and lower yangtze river basin 4 sichuan basin 5 guizhou plateau 6 yunnan plateau and 7 pearl river basin according to the similarity of soil characteristic lakes in zhejiang province were included in the yangzi river basin and lakes in east and west of guangdong province were included in the pearl river basin data on tp and chl a concentration from natural lakes in sichuan basin and guizhou plateau were not available consequently there are only 5 groups of natural lakes compared to 7 groups of reservoirs table 1 shows the morphological parameters lake depth surface area and volume number of sampling sites one site refers to a single lake or reservoir and number of observations for each group of lakes the regional average iron content in soil was calculated based on provincial average values reported by wei et al 1990 soil samples were digested by nitric acid and perchloric acid and iron was measured by icp aes inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry the background value of soil iron content is primary determined by geology and climate condition it is relatively stable and is less affected by human activity the reported data of soil iron dated back to 1990 is similar to the contemporary soil iron content during 2000 and 2014 in our study the monthly air temperature and precipitation were obtained from government statistical yearbooks http nianjian cnki net data on chl a tp soil iron air temperature and precipitation for each group of lakes are summarized in table 2 2 2 multilevel hierarchical modeling exploratory analysis of the data fig s1 and table s1 fig s2 and table s2 shows the difference in tp precipitation and chl a tp relationships among 12 groups by grouping lakes reservoirs we introduce a hierarchical structure into the data observations nested with each lake lakes nested in individual groups and so on because of the imbalance in sample sizes number of observations in each lake and number of lakes in each group multilevel hierarchical modeling approach is the most appropriate method for analyzing such data this approach is able to link individual observations with group level variables and make the statistical inference based on two pieces of information group means and overall mean malve and qian 2006 qian 2017 a log log linear model is used as the basic model form for both tp precipitation and chl a tp relationships the log log linear regression represents a proportional change relationship between the response and the predictor qian 2017 pages 186 187 that is the model assumes an increase of 1 in the predictor variable will lead to a fixed percentage increase in the response variable this is a reasonable assumption when using the natural logarithm the fitted slope β or δ is the fixed percentage β or δ at the observational level we assume that the natural log transformed tp concentration can be modeled by a

when tp concentration is at the same level grand mean of the data a higher intercept suggests a higher phosphorus utilization efficiency i e the same level of tp leads to a higher chl a fig 3a a higher slope indicates that a lake is more sensitive to tp in other words high soil iron may enhance phosphorus limitation and drive the parameters of chl a tp regression model in reservoirs to increase from temperate to tropical and subtropical regions as natural lakes have higher tp concentrations than reservoirs the phosphorus limitation in lakes could be weaker this may explain why soil iron content has a lesser effect on the coefficients of regression model for natural lakes 5 conclusions soil iron can act as a critical variable at the regional scale for mediating the impact of precipitation on tp concentration in lakes and reservoirs this in turn drives the latitudinal variation in chl a tp relationship in reservoirs our study implies that the increase in extreme precipitation events anticipated under future climate conditions may substantially mitigate eutrophication in tropical and subtropical reservoirs but worsening the conditions in temperate lakes

18972,cyanobacterial blooms continue to serve as one of the most serious global issues threatening water supply and human health during cyanobacterial bloom season a large oh yield equipment was developed and installed after coagulation settling in a 12000 ton day drinking water treatment system in xiamen china an oh concentration of 7 76 57 8 μmol l was formed by using the oxygen activated species generated by strong ionisation discharge combining with the effect of water jet cavitation oh pre treatment at a dose of 1 0 mg l inactivated cyanobacterial blooms in the process of conveying bloom water within only 20s which were then removed by sand filtration under sem observation dominant microcystis sp colonies connected by mucilage were dispersed into individuals that still retained the cell integrity indicating no release of intracellular organic matter iom according to a flow cytometry analysis the main cause of oh inactivation was the breakage of dna strands meanwhile the oh mineralized microcystin lr was by breaking the c c conjugated diene bond and crucial opening the persistent benzene ring to carboxylic acid m z 158 0 during oh pre treatment of 1 0 mg l and naclo disinfection of 0 5 mg l all water quality indexes and disinfection by product dbp contents complied with the chinese sanitary standards for drinking water therefore the oh based on the strong ionisation discharge showed great prospect for large scale drinking water treatment in the removal of cyanobacterial blooms while retaining cell integrity as well as the degradation of toxins graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacterial blooms oh pre treatment cell integrity dna damage oh degradation microcystin lr 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms continue to serve as one of the most serious global issues threatening water resources due to the intensity of human activities that impact waterways and underlying climate change these blooms can directly impact the quality of drinking water through the production of toxic metabolites such as microcystin lr and through drastic changes in turbidity ph dissolved oxygen and taste and odour which pose a great challenge to drinking water production he et al 2016 a drinking water crisis followed a massive bloom of the toxin producing cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa in lake taihu wuxi which is china s third largest freshwater lake leaving approximately two million people without drinking water for at least a week in late may 2007 zhang et al 2010 another serious bloom occurred in the jiulong river watershed which is the primary water source for 80 of the people in xiamen china affecting 20 km of the watershed and lasting for a month in january 2009 li et al 2011 conventional water treatment technologies including coagulation flocculation and filtration are inefficient for removing cyanobacterial blooms and dissolved toxin compounds common pre treatment oxidants including chlorine potassium permanganate kmno4 and ozone have often been used in conventional processes naceradska et al 2017 oxidation can alter the surface characteristics and charge of cyanobacteria which then enhances the effectiveness of coagulation and flocculation for their subsequent removal fan et al 2013 removing intact cyanobacterial cells is the most effective way of minimising the risk due to the release of intracellular organic matter iom wert et al 2014 nevertheless exposure to low amounts of chlorine 4 0 29 mg min l causes a loss in cell viability and corresponding cyanotoxin release daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012a the most notable disadvantage of the use of chlorine is that it can react with organics forming by products that are toxic to mammals including carcinogenic trihalomethanes thms svrcek and smith 2004 the action of kmno4 at concentrations of 3 mg l for peroxidation did not compromise the integrity of membranes but higher concentrations 5 and 10 mg l induced significant cyanobacterial cell lysis fan et al 2013 the addition of kmno4 to the intake of water plants raises concerns about the accumulation of mn and water colour naceradska et al 2017 qi et al 2016 more than 1 mg l of ozone could induce the release of algal toxins from ruptured cells directly to form chlorinated dbps and high levels of bromates in subsequent cl2 disinfection units coral et al 2013 other oxidants may share similar trade offs which warrants a systematic study of whether they also cause cell lysis in particular studies are required on the concentrations of oxidants for effective pre oxidation fan et al 2013 oh advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozone hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and uv photocatalyst are recognised as effective techniques as they readily oxidise cyanotoxin into non toxic degradation products the efficiency of both molecular and radical ozone for degrading cyanotoxins has been evaluated at laboratory scales using standard cyanotoxin concentrates spiked in buffered ultrapure or natural water al momani and jarrah 2010 a laboratory photo fenton process with 20 mg l h2o2 reduced microcystin lr from a potable water source to below 1 μg l after 20 min park et al 2017 photocatalyst under uv a irradiation almost completely mineralized microcystin lr after 48 h and cylindrospermopsin after 36 h in 5 ml solution based on toc and inorganic ions no2 no3 so4 2 and nh4 determinations the conclusion that oh attack is the main mechanism fotiou et al 2015 triantis et al 2012 moreover dionysiou group investigated the influence of variable amino acids of microcystins on the degradation kinetics and reaction mechanisms which provides important scientific data for the treatment of cyanotoxin mcs by uv aops he et al 2015 the key to treating cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water systems is determining methods for inactivating algae blooms and degrading toxins while retaining cell integrity during the bloom season at the xiang an drinking water treatment plant xiamen china large oh yield equipment was installed after coagulation settling in the 12000 ton day treatment system with strong ionisation discharge oxygen activated species were injected into the gas liquid injectors in the pipe and combined with the effects of water jet cavitation to produce oh the specific objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate the effectiveness of oh pre treatment on algae colonies in natural bloom water 2 analyse the cyanobacterial cell integrity and causes of oh inactivation 3 investigate the degradation of microcystin lr and 4 evaluate all water quality indexes and disinfection by products dbps 2 materials and method 2 1 water source and site description the raw water of the xiang an water treatment plant is obtained from the jiulong river and bantou reservoir in xiamen china the bloom season occurs from may to october every year these water bodies serve as a potable water source for the surrounding municipalities which have a population of 200000 people the cyanobacteria bloom occurred in may 2017 and the total content was 17 9 104 cells ml which consisted of dominant microcystis sp colonies of 97 7 a small number pseudanabaena sp of 0 96 cyclotella sp of 0 45 and other algae the main water quality indexes were as follows water temperature 26 5 c ph 7 29 turbidity 11 8 ntu dissolved oxygen do 6 02 mg l chemical oxygen demand codmn 1 8 mg l total organic carbon toc 2 42 mg l total phosphorus 0 12 mg l total nitrogen 2 16 mg l and ammonia nh3 n 0 02 mg l 2 2 procedure of oh treatment of cyanobacterial blooms a conventional drinking water treatment system is used in the xiang an water plant including coagulation settling sand filtration naclo disinfection and clean water reservoirs with a daily treatment process capacity of 12 000 ton day a oh equipment was developed and installed in this system for the removal of cyanobacterial blooms and degradation of microcystin lr as shown in fig 1 which consisted of 24 modules of plasma reactors in a parallel array and their corresponding power supplies 5 gas liquid injectors 2 gas liquid mixers 3 filters a pump as well as a cooling water unit for the plasma reactors the energy cost for a full scale treatment of 12 000 ton day is 20 wh m3 in the coagulation sedimentation tank approximately 80 of the blooms colloid impurities and suspended particles are removed by coagulation reactions with polymeric aluminum ferric chloride sulfate pafcs and gravity settling resulting in a reduction in the turbidity to 3 0 4 0 ntu for oh pre treatment valve a was opened and the cyanobacterial bloom water was transported along the green pipe at a flow rate of 500 m3 h to the sand filtration tank the produced oh solution was injected into a liquid liquid mixer to deactivate algae colonies and degrade toxins such as microcystin lr for naclo pre treatment valve b was opened and the cyanobacterial bloom water was transported along the pink pipe to which the naclo solution was injected using a peristaltic pump to compare the effects of pre treatment the oh and naclo solutions were both injected at point d to flow into sample point 3 with a treatment time of 20 s in the main pipe all water samples were collected in 5 l glass vessels at points 1 2 3 6 and 7 to simulate the severe release of algal toxins valve c was opened and bloom water was transported along the branch pipe at 1 0 m3 h to the treatment tank with a volume of 1 0 m3 the prepared microcystin lr solution was injected into the branch pipe using a peristaltic pump the oh and naclo solutions were both injected at point e and flowed to sample point 4 with a treatment time of 20 s in the branch pipe all water samples were collected in 1 l glass vessels at sample points 4 and 5 in the sand filtration tank dead algae cells regarded as particles and suspended particles were further removed by interception gravity sedimentation and physical adsorption while most living algae cells could pass through sand filtration to the pipe network subsequently naclo disinfection was used to deactivate pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria viruses and protozoa and to inhibit their regrowth in water supply networks finally the purified water was stored in the clean water tank and then pumped to the pipe networks to serve as the drinking water supply 2 3 oh formation and measurement with the strong ionisation discharge oxygen activated species including o2 o 1d o o2 o2 a1δg and o3 were produced in plasma reactors and dissolved into some of the filtration water by gas liquid injectors with a high mass transfer efficiency of approximately 98 in the pipe water jet cavitation created numerous micro bubbles and ultrasonic hydraulic shock waves zhang et al 2018 the oh were generated to a steady concentration at 1 s by the bursting of numerous bubbles as optimal chemical reaction conditions with a high temperature and pressure of approximately 3000 k and 105 106 pa bai et al 2016 the oh radicals in water underwent complicated chain reactions resulting in their rapid conversion to other oxygen species such as h2o2 ho2ˉ o2 ˉ o3 ˉ ho3 and o2 h2o which are referred to as total reactive oxidants tros the tro calculated as cl was measured on line using a chlorine analyser hach cl17 usa and adjusted following the colorimetric dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method using a bioquest ce2501 spectrophotometer cecil instruments ltd uk based on usepa method 330 5 usepa 1978 using the 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba as a probe the reaction with oh can forms a hydroxylated derivative of 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid 3 4 dhba which was measured by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1260 usa equipped with a reversed phase c18 column zorbax eclipse xdb and an ultraviolet detector at 210 nm with the same water temperature and ph in the system fig 1 the pure water or the pure water dissolved 4 hba was pumped into a pipe in which the same concentration of oxygen active species were injected into for the measurement of tro or oh concentration respectively and the samples were collected in 200 ml glass vessels as shown in fig 2 a two 3 4 dhba peaks were found to demonstrate the formation of oh the measured oh concentrations reached 36 0 μm l for a tro of 11 4 mg l and 57 8 μmol l for a tro of 14 2 mg l as shown in fig 2 b the relationship between oh and tro was linear with r2 0 9735 when the tro increased from 3 5 to 14 2 mg l oh increased from 7 76 to 57 8 μmol l 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 analyses of cell integrity the cells surfaces were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem su 70 hitachi japan the observed samples were treated as follows fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 18 h concentrated by mesh sieves dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol 30 50 70 80 90 100 permeated with tert butyl alcohol and freeze dried and gold coated 2 4 2 detection of dna damage damage to the dna of algae was detected using a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa at an emitted light wavelength of 488 nm tunel stain terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick end labelling promega usa was used to mark the dna strand fracture which emits green fluorescence at a wavelength of 530 nm the obtained data were analysed using flowjo software 2 4 3 determination of microcystin lr microcystin lr was measured using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms ms 1260 6460 agilent usa equipped with a reversed phase c18 column the collected samples were treated by solid phase extraction ms data

usa with a quartz capillary column 2 4 4 dbps measurements clo2 clo3 and bro3 were measured by ion chromatography thermo 2100 usa equipped with an as11 anion exchange chromatographic column 4 250 mm and an as19 anion exchange chromatographic column 4 250 mm according to usepa method 300 1 usepa 1993 haloalkanes formaldehyde and trichloroacetic aldehyde were detected using a gc ms qp2020plus japan equipped with a capillary column hp 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 2 μm film thickness agilent usa and electron capture detector according to usepa methods 524 2 usepa 1992 and 551 1 usepa 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of cyanobacterial blooms by oh pre treatment during cyanobacterial blooms conventional drinking water treatment systems are inefficient for removing the high levels of cyanobacteria large oh yield equipment was installed after coagulation settling for the removal of blooms in a 12 000 ton day drinking water treatment system as shown in fig 1 the total cyanobacterial content of raw water was 17 9 104 cells ml which consisted of dominant microcystis sp of 17 5 104 cells ml formed as colonies pseudanabaena sp of 1730 cells ml cyclotella sp of 810 cells ml and other algae of 1230 cells ml coagulation settling decreased the total algae content to 1 62 104 cells ml containing microcystis sp of 1 56 104 cells ml a small amount of pseudanabaena sp of 400 cells ml and other algae of 110 cells ml the results of oh naclo pre treatment for cyanobacterial blooms are shown in fig 3 during which tro was injected into the main pipe at 1 0 mg l with a treatment time of 20 s the numbers of viable or nonviable algae cells were determined using the sytox green stain life technologies usa for oh pre treatment no living algae cells were detected for naclo pre treatment there were 3780 cells ml alive and 11 650 cells ml dead algae with 20 s treated and no living algae cells detected after 2 h consequently dead algae cells considered as particles were captured by sand filtration while the alive algae could transport through sand filtration to enter the clean water tank and ultimately the supply networks in addition the residual naclo would receive a long time to react with algae resulting in their death and a release of their metabolites especial toxins which would limit the safety of drinking water microcystis form as colonies in natural water are more resistant to oxidation than unicellular algae chlorine of 2 and 5 mg l were applied to cyanobacteria blooms with approximately 57 104 cells ml from missisquoi bay and reduced the total number of cells by 28 53 through full cell lysis zamyadi et al 2012b chlorine of 1 0 mg l treated the colonial microcystis aeruginosa of 10 104 cells ml in the size of 37 270 mm from a reservoir in taiwan and reduced the intact cells from 88 to 14 with the contact time of 10 min leading to a release of secondary metabolites in a laboratory fan et al 2016 20 mg l h2o2 was used to inactivate natural microcystis colonies of 100 μm collected from taihu lake china resulted that the chlorophyll a was reduced to 13 of control level after 72 h exposure liu et al 2017 1 9 mg min ozone with a gas flow of 0 5 l min removed microcystis aeruginosa by 35 rate within 10 min in 1 75 l water tank wu et al 2012 however the oh advanced oxidation based on strong ionisation discharge inactivated entire cyanobacterial blooms during drinking water treatment within only 20 s in the conventional 12 000 ton day treatment system 3 2 analysis of algae cell integrity with oh naclo inactivation to estimate the cyanobacterial cell integrity upon oh naclo inactivation cell surface morphologies were observed using an sem as shown in fig 4 a and b in the control sample there was a clear microcystis sp colony with individual algal cells closely connected by mucilage which had a diameter of 1 5 μm and a smooth spherical surface in the oh treated sample 20 s the algae colony was dispersed into individual cells that still retained their shape indicating no release of iom meanwhile the mucilage which is a slimy layer predominantly consisting of polysaccharides and protein was degraded li et al 2013 the cause of total algae death was the passage of oh through the cell membrane to attack the purine and pyrimidine bases in the dna leading to nonselective dna strand scission bohne et al 2005 for the naclo treated sample 20 s a microcystis sp colony connected by mucilage was present but some individual algae cells marked pink circles were ruptured for the naclo treated sample 2 h a large number of algae in a microcystis sp colony connected by mucilage were deformed and ruptured causing of death the presence of mucilage indicated that naclo cannot effectively degrade the mucilage matter unlike oh naclo inactivation would cause extensive damage to the cell membrane ma et al 2012 resulting in the release of iom and the formation of dbps 3 3 dna damage of algae cell with oh naclo inactivation to determine the cause of algae death dna damage of algae cells was analysed using a flow cytometer and the results are shown in fig 5 the broken dna strand labelled with tunel staining could emit a stronger green fluorescence in the control figure the red line at the 104 1 position on the x axis was used to distinguish between weaker and stronger green fluorescence the left side in red line indicated a region with intact dna and the right side indicated a region with broken dna approximately 10 20 of algae had broken dna strands even though all algae were living in the oh treated sample 20 s that all algae had died the fluorescence peak shifted to the right at 103 106 and 94 22 algal cells were identified to have broken dna strands the main reason that the oh caused algae death was the breakage of dna strand which could impede the synthesis of proteins and evoke a complex caspase 3 or 7 signal pathway roos et al 2016 in the naclo treated sample 20 s the position of fluorescence peak was no different to that of the control sample there was almost no change in the level of intact and broken dna strands even though 75 50 algae cells had died in the naclo treated sample 2 h the fluorescence peak slightly moved to the right and 36 70 algae were confirmed to have broken dna strands even though all cells were dead the main cause of algae death by naclo was not dna strand damage but algal cell rupture dai et al 2016 ou et al 2011 therefore naclo pre treatment for cyanobacterial blooms in a drinking water system could cause the release of intracellular substances especially algal toxins and odours which could reduce drinking water safety 3 4 oh degradation of microcystin lr whether pre oxidation with a strong oxidant would induce the lysis of algal cells and release of intracellular algal toxins is of great concern to simulate severe toxin release by cyanobacterial blooms 1 0 m3 h of bloom water was separated to the branch pipe after coagulation settling where the prepared microcystin lr was injected to reach a concentration of 10 4 μg l the hplc chromatogram of microcystin lr by oh naclo degradation is shown in fig 6 a in which 1 0 mg l of tro was injected into the branch pipe with a treated time of 20 s the oh completely degraded the microcystin lr from 10 4 μg l to nd while the naclo decreased the level of microcystin lr to 9 9 μg l achieving a degradation rate of 4 81 to verify the oh degradation of microcystin lr tro was injected into the branch pipe at 2 and 4 5 mg l to degrade 1 mg l of microcystin lr and water samples were collected after a treated time of 6 s the total ion current chromatogram for the oh degradation of microcystin lr is shown in fig 6 b in the control sample a microcystin lr peak was clearly identified when 2 mg l of tro was injected the microcystin lr peak disappeared and five new peaks m1 m5 were detected based on the ms ms analyses of the structural formulas of the molecular fragments and previous studies m1 m z 795 4 m2 m z 835 4 m3 m z 815 3 m4 m z 232 1 and m5 m z 158 0 are presented in fig 6 b with the injection of 4 5 mg l of tro no peaks were detected to fit with the basic line indicating that intermediates m1 m5 were completely degraded microcystin lr is a monocyclic heptapeptide composed of seven amino acids and a side chain which can stably exist for at least several weeks in natural waters botes et al 1985 the oh degraded the microcystin lr through the dihydroxylation and hydroxyl substitution of the c c in the adda group to produce ketoenol tautomers such as those at m z 795 4 m z 835 4 and m z 815 3 which were further oxidised into amino acid compounds with smaller molecules andersen et al 2014 chang et al 2014 in addition the oh attacked the m z 232 1 to form hydroxyphenylic compound and crucially to open its persistent benzene ring to carboxylic acid m z 158 0 for the mineralization of microcystin lr moon et al 2017 likewise dionysiou group have confirmed that oh in uv aops completely mineralized microcystin lr triantis et al 2012 other degradation methods such as chlorine dioxide bimetallic nanoparticles and the photo fenton process have also been reported to remove microcystin lr chlorine can oxidise dissolved 53 μg l microcystins efficiently if a sufficient amount of residual chlorine 3 5 mg l and contact time 1 60 min are applied fan et al 2014 an aqueous hclo dosage of 2 mg l degraded 50 μg l microcystin lr to 1 μg l within 40 min but the formation of toxic chlorination by products can be an issue zong et al 2013 chlorine dioxide achieved no significant removal of a prepared microcystin lr in deionised water at 240 mg min l ding et al 2010 both fe ni and fe pd nanoparticles based on nanoscale zero valent iron removed approximately 90 microcystin lr after 120 min in a laboratory experiment gao et al 2016 uv chlorine 1 5 mg l achieved a complete removal of 1 mg l mc lr after 16 min in 10 ml deionised water and the contribution of oh was 39 more than that of 8 uv 27 cl2 and 26 reactive chlorine species respectively duan et al 2018 in this study the oh produced by the strong ionisation discharge degraded whole microcystin lr within 20 s this is because oh has a greater oxidation potential e 0 2 8 v and chemical reaction rate 108 109 m 1s 1 than those of chlorine e 0 1 63 v approximately 10 1 m 1s 1 respectively mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 therefore the oh advanced oxidation exhibits a great potential in the degradation of algal toxins during the removal of cyanobacterial blooms for large scale industrial application 3 5 naclo disinfection in the drinking water system cyanobacterial blooms in water sources such as rivers lakes and reservoirs may cause drastic changes in turbidity ph taste and odour which pose a great challenge to drinking water production in the xiang an drinking water treatment plant naclo was used for the disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms and generated residual disinfectant to prevent microbial regrowth in the water distribution system following the chinese sanitary standards for drinking water gb5749 2006 106 drinking water quality indexes were detected by the xiamen monitoring station of the chinese urban water supply in xiamen of china which had the qualification certification of china inspection body and laboratory mandatory approval cma main indexes are shown in supporting table s1 the ph value of raw water was 7 29 due to the high algae content of 17 9 104 cells ml which was reduced to 7 19 after sand filtration due to the oh pre treatment of algae colonies accordingly the turbidity of raw water 11 8 ntu was decreased to 0 18 ntu after sand filtration during the whole treatment process no taste or odour were detected and the levels of colour conductivity and visible organisms did not change the codmn toc and nh3 n decreased to 1 0 1 74 and 0 02 mg l respectively during coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration pathogenic microorganism indexes such as heterotrophic plate counts total coliform bacteria escherichia coli and thermotolerant coliform bacteria were decreased to 57 cfu ml nd nd and nd respectively after disinfection with 0 5 mg l of naclo the total colonies were decreased to nd in addition the levels of no2 no3 so4 2 cl f and s barely changed and the levels of al fe mn zn and as also did not change both volatile phenols and linear alkylbenzene sulphonate las are widespread global aquatic pollutants volatile phenols can cause harmful effects on the central nervous system heart lungs and kidneys zhang et al 2012 while las might induce genotoxic manifestations by adversely affecting the integrity of dna shukla and trivedi 2018 after disinfection with 0 5 mg l of naclo the levels of both volatile phenols and las were below the limit set by gb5749 2006 of china china 2006 the biological toxicity was measured using photobacterium phosphoreum t3 spp as an indicator organism following chinese standard methods china 1995 which represent the acute toxicity of water the result below zero indicated the safety of the drinking water treated by this process overall during the oh pre treatment 1 0 mg l and naclo disinfection 0 5 mg l of cyanobacterial blooms all 106 drinking water quality indexes complied with chinese sanitary standards for drinking water gb5749 2006 china 2006 3 6 dbps by naclo disinfection the pre oxidation of cyanobacterial blooms releases intracellular compounds that may contribute to the pool of chlorinated dbp precursors assuming that post chlorination is used as a final disinfection process coral et al 2013 the most notable disadvantage of the use of chlorine is that it can react with organics to form by products that are toxic to mammals svrcek and smith 2004 including carcinogenic thms therefore the possible dbp of oh pre treatment and naclo disinfection needs to be analysed based on the china national standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 china 2006 in the 12000 ton day drinking water treatment system cl content of 6 91 mg l and br content of 0 02 mg l were detected in the raw water the dbp data for naclo disinfection at a dosage of 0 5 mg l are shown in table 1 bromate bro3 is a potential carcinogen and its limit in drinking water is below 10 μg l according to the world health organisation who the environmental protection agency epa and gb5749 2006 of china during oh pre treatment bro3 was not detected after naclo disinfection while quantities of 2 6 46 μg l were observed by werschkun werschkun et al 2012 meanwhile there was no change in the level of chlorite clo2 while the level of chlorate clo3 slightly increased to 14 μg l which is much lower than the limit of 700 μg l set by gb5749 2006 moreover methane was not detected while the level of chloral increased to 4 2 μg l which is lower than the 10 μg l set by gb5749 2006 haas which could increase the risk of cancer were analysed in this study no dcaa or tcaa was detected after naclo disinfection xue et al found that the levels of dcaa and tcaa were 14 79 and 22 45 μg l respectively with a free chlorine dosage of 6 mg l after disinfection for 4 h xue et al 2017 thms have been demonstrated to act as strong carcinogens and mutagens to humans and are also intermediates to other dbps bai et al 2018 szczuka et al 2017 after naclo disinfection the tcm dbcm and dcbm contents were slightly increased to 5 4 μg l 2 0 μg l and 4 4 μg l respectively which were much lower than the limits of 60 μg l 100 μg l and 60 μg l set by gb5749 2006 furthermore no tbm dcm and dce were detected however the thms content reached 190 μg l which is much lower than the 1000 μg l set by gb5749 2006 but 2 4 times that of the 80 μg l regulated by the epa drinking water standards and health advisories hua hua and reckhow 2007 reported that the levels of thms were 110 240 μg l in different natural surface waters with a cl2 dosage of 0 5 mg l and disinfection for 48 h in summary during the oh pre treatment and naclo disinfection of cyanobacterial blooms at a capacity of 12 000 ton day the total dbp contents were much lower than chinese sanitary standards for drinking water gb5749 2006 4 conclusions during the bloom season at xiang an drinking water treatment plant xiamen china a large oh yield equipment which oxygen activated species generated by the strong ionisation discharge were combined with the effect of water jet cavitation to form oh at a concentration of 7 76 57 8 μmol l was developed and installed after coagulation settling in a 12000 ton day treatment system with compared to common pre treatment oxidants the oh technology exhibited great potential for large scale drinking water treatment in the removal of cyanobacterial blooms while retaining cell integrity as well as the degradation of toxins the main results are as follows 1 for oh pre treatment at a dose of 1 0 mg l the cyanobacterial blooms were inactivated during the process of conveying bloom water within 20 s and then removed by sand filtration for naclo pre treatment 3780 cells ml of living algae persistent which could transport through sand filtration and enter supply networks reducing the safety of drinking water 2 according to the observation of cyanobacterial cell integrity by sem for oh inactivation the dominant microcystis sp colonies connected by mucilage were dispersed into individuals that retained their shape indicating no release of iom for 2 h of naclo inactivation algae cells were still connected by mucilage but many were deformed and ruptured according to the analyses of dna damage using a flow cytometer with oh inactivation 94 22 of algal cells were identified to have broken dna strands however with naclo inactivation treated for 2 h only 36 70 algae were identified to have broken dna strands therefore the main cause of inactivation by oh was the breakage of the dna strand while by naclo was the extensive destruction of cell membranes resulting in the release of intracellular algal toxins 3 whether oh or naclo pre treatment would induce the release of intracellular algal toxins is of great concern when 1 0 mg l of tro was injected into the branch pipe at a treatment time of 20 s the oh degraded the levels of microcystin lr from 10 4 μg l to nd while naclo decreased the level to 9 9 μg l it was also determined whether oh or naclo could break the microcystin lr at conjugated c c diene bond to form a cyclic peptide and persistent benzene product but only oh opened the benzene ring to carboxylic acid m z 158 0 for its mineralization 4 during the oh pre treatment of 1 0 mg l and naclo disinfection of 0 5 mg l all drinking water quality indexes and dbp

18972,cyanobacterial blooms continue to serve as one of the most serious global issues threatening water supply and human health during cyanobacterial bloom season a large oh yield equipment was developed and installed after coagulation settling in a 12000 ton day drinking water treatment system in xiamen china an oh concentration of 7 76 57 8 μmol l was formed by using the oxygen activated species generated by strong ionisation discharge combining with the effect of water jet cavitation oh pre treatment at a dose of 1 0 mg l inactivated cyanobacterial blooms in the process of conveying bloom water within only 20s which were then removed by sand filtration under sem observation dominant microcystis sp colonies connected by mucilage were dispersed into individuals that still retained the cell integrity indicating no release of intracellular organic matter iom according to a flow cytometry analysis the main cause of oh inactivation was the breakage of dna strands meanwhile the oh mineralized microcystin lr was by breaking the c c conjugated diene bond and crucial opening the persistent benzene ring to carboxylic acid m z 158 0 during oh pre treatment of 1 0 mg l and naclo disinfection of 0 5 mg l all water quality indexes and disinfection by product dbp contents complied with the chinese sanitary standards for drinking water therefore the oh based on the strong ionisation discharge showed great prospect for large scale drinking water treatment in the removal of cyanobacterial blooms while retaining cell integrity as well as the degradation of toxins graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacterial blooms oh pre treatment cell integrity dna damage oh degradation microcystin lr 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms continue to serve as one of the most serious global issues threatening water resources due to the intensity of human activities that impact waterways and underlying climate change these blooms can directly impact the quality of drinking water through the production of toxic metabolites such as microcystin lr and through drastic changes in turbidity ph dissolved oxygen and taste and odour which pose a great challenge to drinking water production he et al 2016 a drinking water crisis followed a massive bloom of the toxin producing cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa in lake taihu wuxi which is china s third largest freshwater lake leaving approximately two million people without drinking water for at least a week in late may 2007 zhang et al 2010 another serious bloom occurred in the jiulong river watershed which is the primary water source for 80 of the people in xiamen china affecting 20 km of the watershed and lasting for a month in january 2009 li et al 2011 conventional water treatment technologies including coagulation flocculation and filtration are inefficient for removing cyanobacterial blooms and dissolved toxin compounds common pre treatment oxidants including chlorine potassium permanganate kmno4 and ozone have often been used in conventional processes naceradska et al 2017 oxidation can alter the surface characteristics and charge of cyanobacteria which then enhances the effectiveness of coagulation and flocculation for their subsequent removal fan et al 2013 removing intact cyanobacterial cells is the most effective way of minimising the risk due to the release of intracellular organic matter iom wert et al 2014 nevertheless exposure to low amounts of chlorine 4 0 29 mg min l causes a loss in cell viability and corresponding cyanotoxin release daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2012a the most notable disadvantage of the use of chlorine is that it can react with organics forming by products that are toxic to mammals including carcinogenic trihalomethanes thms svrcek and smith 2004 the action of kmno4 at concentrations of 3 mg l for peroxidation did not compromise the integrity of membranes but higher concentrations 5 and 10 mg l induced significant cyanobacterial cell lysis fan et al 2013 the addition of kmno4 to the intake of water plants raises concerns about the accumulation of mn and water colour naceradska et al 2017 qi et al 2016 more than 1 mg l of ozone could induce the release of algal toxins from ruptured cells directly to form chlorinated dbps and high levels of bromates in subsequent cl2 disinfection units coral et al 2013 other oxidants may share similar trade offs which warrants a systematic study of whether they also cause cell lysis in particular studies are required on the concentrations of oxidants for effective pre oxidation fan et al 2013 oh advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozone hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and uv photocatalyst are recognised as effective techniques as they readily oxidise cyanotoxin into non toxic degradation products the efficiency of both molecular and radical ozone for degrading cyanotoxins has been evaluated at laboratory scales using standard cyanotoxin concentrates spiked in buffered ultrapure or natural water al momani and jarrah 2010 a laboratory photo fenton process with 20 mg l h2o2 reduced microcystin lr from a potable water source to below 1 μg l after 20 min park et al 2017 photocatalyst under uv a irradiation almost completely mineralized microcystin lr after 48 h and cylindrospermopsin after 36 h in 5 ml solution based on toc and inorganic ions no2 no3 so4 2 and nh4 determinations the conclusion that oh attack is the main mechanism fotiou et al 2015 triantis et al 2012 moreover dionysiou group investigated the influence of variable amino acids of microcystins on the degradation kinetics and reaction mechanisms which provides important scientific data for the treatment of cyanotoxin mcs by uv aops he et al 2015 the key to treating cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water systems is determining methods for inactivating algae blooms and degrading toxins while retaining cell integrity during the bloom season at the xiang an drinking water treatment plant xiamen china large oh yield equipment was installed after coagulation settling in the 12000 ton day treatment system with strong ionisation discharge oxygen activated species were injected into the gas liquid injectors in the pipe and combined with the effects of water jet cavitation to produce oh the specific objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate the effectiveness of oh pre treatment on algae colonies in natural bloom water 2 analyse the cyanobacterial cell integrity and causes of oh inactivation 3 investigate the degradation of microcystin lr and 4 evaluate all water quality indexes and disinfection by products dbps 2 materials and method 2 1 water source and site description the raw water of the xiang an water treatment plant is obtained from the jiulong river and bantou reservoir in xiamen china the bloom season occurs from may to october every year these water bodies serve as a potable water source for the surrounding municipalities which have a population of 200000 people the cyanobacteria bloom occurred in may 2017 and the total content was 17 9 104 cells ml which consisted of dominant microcystis sp colonies of 97 7 a small number pseudanabaena sp of 0 96 cyclotella sp of 0 45 and other algae the main water quality indexes were as follows water temperature 26 5 c ph 7 29 turbidity 11 8 ntu dissolved oxygen do 6 02 mg l chemical oxygen demand codmn 1 8 mg l total organic carbon toc 2 42 mg l total phosphorus 0 12 mg l total nitrogen 2 16 mg l and ammonia nh3 n 0 02 mg l 2 2 procedure of oh treatment of cyanobacterial blooms a conventional drinking water treatment system is used in the xiang an water plant including coagulation settling sand filtration naclo disinfection and clean water reservoirs with a daily treatment process capacity of 12 000 ton day a oh equipment was developed and installed in this system for the removal of cyanobacterial blooms and degradation of microcystin lr as shown in fig 1 which consisted of 24 modules of plasma reactors in a parallel array and their corresponding power supplies 5 gas liquid injectors 2 gas liquid mixers 3 filters a pump as well as a cooling water unit for the plasma reactors the energy cost for a full scale treatment of 12 000 ton day is 20 wh m3 in the coagulation sedimentation tank approximately 80 of the blooms colloid impurities and suspended particles are removed by coagulation reactions with polymeric aluminum ferric chloride sulfate pafcs and gravity settling resulting in a reduction in the turbidity to 3 0 4 0 ntu for oh pre treatment valve a was opened and the cyanobacterial bloom water was transported along the green pipe at a flow rate of 500 m3 h to the sand filtration tank the produced oh solution was injected into a liquid liquid mixer to deactivate algae colonies and degrade toxins such as microcystin lr for naclo pre treatment valve b was opened and the cyanobacterial bloom water was transported along the pink pipe to which the naclo solution was injected using a peristaltic pump to compare the effects of pre treatment the oh and naclo solutions were both injected at point d to flow into sample point 3 with a treatment time of 20 s in the main pipe all water samples were collected in 5 l glass vessels at points 1 2 3 6 and 7 to simulate the severe release of algal toxins valve c was opened and bloom water was transported along the branch pipe at 1 0 m3 h to the treatment tank with a volume of 1 0 m3 the prepared microcystin lr solution was injected into the branch pipe using a peristaltic pump the oh and naclo solutions were both injected at point e and flowed to sample point 4 with a treatment time of 20 s in the branch pipe all water samples were collected in 1 l glass vessels at sample points 4 and 5 in the sand filtration tank dead algae cells regarded as particles and suspended particles were further removed by interception gravity sedimentation and physical adsorption while most living algae cells could pass through sand filtration to the pipe network subsequently naclo disinfection was used to deactivate pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria viruses and protozoa and to inhibit their regrowth in water supply networks finally the purified water was stored in the clean water tank and then pumped to the pipe networks to serve as the drinking water supply 2 3 oh formation and measurement with the strong ionisation discharge oxygen activated species including o2 o 1d o o2 o2 a1δg and o3 were produced in plasma reactors and dissolved into some of the filtration water by gas liquid injectors with a high mass transfer efficiency of approximately 98 in the pipe water jet cavitation created numerous micro bubbles and ultrasonic hydraulic shock waves zhang et al 2018 the oh were generated to a steady concentration at 1 s by the bursting of numerous bubbles as optimal chemical reaction conditions with a high temperature and pressure of approximately 3000 k and 105 106 pa bai et al 2016 the oh radicals in water underwent complicated chain reactions resulting in their rapid conversion to other oxygen species such as h2o2 ho2ˉ o2 ˉ o3 ˉ ho3 and o2 h2o which are referred to as total reactive oxidants tros the tro calculated as cl was measured on line using a chlorine analyser hach cl17 usa and adjusted following the colorimetric dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method using a bioquest ce2501 spectrophotometer cecil instruments ltd uk based on usepa method 330 5 usepa 1978 using the 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba as a probe the reaction with oh can forms a hydroxylated derivative of 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid 3 4 dhba which was measured by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1260 usa equipped with a reversed phase c18 column zorbax eclipse xdb and an ultraviolet detector at 210 nm with the same water temperature and ph in the system fig 1 the pure water or the pure water dissolved 4 hba was pumped into a pipe in which the same concentration of oxygen active species were injected into for the measurement of tro or oh concentration respectively and the samples were collected in 200 ml glass vessels as shown in fig 2 a two 3 4 dhba peaks were found to demonstrate the formation of oh the measured oh concentrations reached 36 0 μm l for a tro of 11 4 mg l and 57 8 μmol l for a tro of 14 2 mg l as shown in fig 2 b the relationship between oh and tro was linear with r2 0 9735 when the tro increased from 3 5 to 14 2 mg l oh increased from 7 76 to 57 8 μmol l 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 analyses of cell integrity the cells surfaces were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem su 70 hitachi japan the observed samples were treated as follows fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 18 h concentrated by mesh sieves dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol 30 50 70 80 90 100 permeated with tert butyl alcohol and freeze dried and gold coated 2 4 2 detection of dna damage damage to the dna of algae was detected using a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa at an emitted light wavelength of 488 nm tunel stain terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick end labelling promega usa was used to mark the dna strand fracture which emits green fluorescence at a wavelength of 530 nm the obtained data were analysed using flowjo software 2 4 3 determination of microcystin lr microcystin lr was measured using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms ms 1260 6460 agilent usa equipped with a reversed phase c18 column the collected samples were treated by solid phase extraction ms data were obtained under the positive ion mode by full scanning from m z 200 to 1200 the small molecule intermediates were detected using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms 7890a 5975c msd agilent usa with a quartz capillary column 2 4 4 dbps measurements clo2 clo3 and bro3 were measured by ion chromatography thermo 2100 usa equipped with an as11 anion exchange chromatographic column 4 250 mm and an as19 anion exchange chromatographic column 4 250 mm according to usepa method 300 1 usepa 1993 haloalkanes formaldehyde and trichloroacetic aldehyde were detected using a gc ms qp2020plus japan equipped with a capillary column hp 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 2 μm film thickness agilent usa and electron capture detector according to usepa methods 524 2 usepa 1992 and 551 1 usepa 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of cyanobacterial blooms by oh pre treatment during cyanobacterial blooms conventional drinking water treatment systems are inefficient for removing the high levels of cyanobacteria large oh yield equipment was installed after coagulation settling for the removal of blooms in a 12 000 ton day drinking water treatment system as shown in fig 1 the total cyanobacterial content of raw water was 17 9 104 cells ml which consisted of dominant microcystis sp of 17 5 104 cells ml formed as colonies pseudanabaena sp of 1730 cells ml cyclotella sp of 810 cells ml and other algae of 1230 cells ml coagulation settling decreased the total algae content to 1 62 104 cells ml containing microcystis sp of 1 56 104 cells ml a small amount of pseudanabaena sp of 400 cells ml and other algae of 110 cells ml the results of oh naclo pre treatment for cyanobacterial blooms are shown in fig 3 during which tro was injected into the main pipe at 1 0 mg l with a treatment time of 20 s the numbers of viable or nonviable algae cells were determined using the sytox green stain life technologies usa for oh pre treatment no living algae cells were detected for naclo pre treatment there were 3780 cells ml alive and 11 650 cells ml dead algae with 20 s treated and no living algae cells detected after 2 h consequently dead algae cells considered as particles were captured by sand filtration while the alive algae could transport through sand filtration to enter the clean water tank and ultimately the supply networks in addition the residual naclo would receive a long time to react with algae resulting in their death and a release of their metabolites especial toxins which would limit the safety of drinking water microcystis form as colonies in natural water are more resistant to oxidation than unicellular algae chlorine of 2 and 5 mg l were applied to cyanobacteria blooms with approximately 57 104 cells ml from missisquoi bay and reduced the total number of cells by 28 53 through full cell lysis zamyadi et al 2012b chlorine of 1 0 mg l treated the colonial microcystis aeruginosa of 10 104 cells ml in the size of 37 270 mm from a reservoir in taiwan and reduced the intact cells from 88 to 14 with the contact time of 10 min leading to a release of secondary metabolites in a laboratory fan et al 2016 20 mg l h2o2 was used to inactivate natural microcystis colonies of 100 μm collected from taihu lake china resulted that the chlorophyll a was reduced to 13 of control level after 72 h exposure liu et al 2017 1 9 mg min ozone with a gas flow of 0 5 l min removed microcystis aeruginosa by 35 rate within 10 min in 1 75 l water tank wu et al 2012 however the oh advanced oxidation based on strong ionisation discharge inactivated entire cyanobacterial blooms during drinking water treatment within only 20 s in the conventional 12 000 ton day treatment system 3 2 analysis of algae cell integrity with oh naclo inactivation to estimate the cyanobacterial cell integrity upon oh naclo inactivation cell surface morphologies were observed using an sem as shown in fig 4 a and b in the control sample there was a clear microcystis sp colony with individual algal cells closely connected by mucilage which had a diameter of 1 5 μm and a smooth spherical surface in the oh treated sample 20 s the algae colony was dispersed into individual cells that still retained their shape indicating no release of iom meanwhile the mucilage which is a slimy layer predominantly consisting of polysaccharides and protein was degraded li et al 2013 the cause of total algae death was the passage of oh through the cell membrane to attack the purine and pyrimidine bases in the dna leading to nonselective dna strand scission bohne et al 2005 for the naclo treated sample 20 s a microcystis sp colony connected by mucilage was present but some individual algae cells marked pink circles were ruptured for the naclo treated sample 2 h a large number of algae in a microcystis sp colony connected by mucilage were deformed and ruptured causing of death the presence of mucilage indicated that naclo cannot effectively degrade the mucilage matter unlike oh naclo inactivation would cause extensive damage to the cell membrane ma et al 2012 resulting in the release of iom and the formation of dbps 3 3 dna damage of algae cell with oh naclo inactivation to determine the cause of algae death dna damage of algae cells was analysed using a flow cytometer and the results are shown in fig 5 the broken dna strand labelled with tunel staining could emit a stronger green fluorescence in the control figure the red line at the 104 1 position on the x axis was used to distinguish between weaker and stronger green fluorescence the left side in red line indicated a region with intact dna and the right side indicated a region with broken dna approximately 10 20 of algae had broken dna strands even though all algae were living in the oh treated sample 20 s that all algae had died the fluorescence peak shifted to the right at 103 106 and 94 22 algal cells were identified to have broken dna strands the main reason that the oh caused algae death was the breakage of dna strand which could impede the synthesis of proteins and evoke a complex caspase 3 or 7 signal pathway roos et al 2016 in the naclo treated sample 20 s the position of fluorescence peak was no different to that of the control sample there was almost no change in the level of intact and broken dna strands even though 75 50 algae cells had died in the naclo treated sample 2 h the fluorescence peak slightly moved to the right and 36 70 algae were confirmed to have broken dna strands even though all cells were dead the main cause of algae death by naclo was not dna strand damage but algal cell rupture dai et al 2016 ou et al 2011 therefore naclo pre treatment for cyanobacterial blooms in a drinking water system could cause the release of intracellular substances especially algal toxins and odours which could reduce drinking water safety 3 4 oh degradation of microcystin lr whether pre oxidation with a strong oxidant would induce the lysis of algal cells and release of intracellular algal toxins is of great concern to simulate severe toxin release by cyanobacterial blooms 1 0 m3 h of bloom water was separated to the branch pipe after coagulation settling where the prepared microcystin lr was injected to reach a concentration of 10 4 μg l the hplc chromatogram of microcystin lr by oh naclo degradation is shown in fig 6 a in which 1 0 mg l of tro was injected into the branch pipe with a treated time of 20 s the oh completely degraded the microcystin lr from 10 4 μg l to nd while the naclo decreased the level of microcystin lr to 9 9 μg l achieving a degradation rate of 4 81 to verify the oh degradation of microcystin lr tro was injected into the branch pipe at 2 and 4 5 mg l to degrade 1 mg l of microcystin lr and water samples were collected after a treated time of 6 s the total ion current chromatogram for the oh degradation of microcystin lr is shown in fig 6 b in the control sample a microcystin lr peak was clearly identified when 2 mg l of tro was injected the microcystin lr peak disappeared and five new peaks m1 m5 were detected based on the ms ms analyses of the structural formulas of the molecular fragments and previous studies m1 m z 795 4 m2 m z 835 4 m3 m z 815 3 m4 m z 232 1 and m5 m z 158 0 are presented in fig 6 b with the injection of 4 5 mg l of tro no peaks were detected to fit with the basic line indicating that intermediates m1 m5 were completely degraded microcystin lr is a monocyclic heptapeptide composed of seven amino acids and a side chain which can stably exist for at least several weeks in natural waters botes et al 1985 the oh degraded the microcystin lr through the dihydroxylation and hydroxyl substitution of the c c in the adda group to produce ketoenol tautomers such as those at m z 795 4 m z 835 4 and m z 815 3 which were further oxidised into amino acid compounds with smaller molecules andersen et al 2014 chang et al 2014 in addition the oh attacked the m z 232 1 to form hydroxyphenylic compound and crucially to open its persistent benzene ring to carboxylic acid m z 158 0 for the mineralization of microcystin lr moon et al 2017 likewise dionysiou group have confirmed that oh in uv aops completely mineralized microcystin lr triantis et al 2012 other degradation methods such as chlorine dioxide bimetallic nanoparticles and the photo fenton process have also been reported to remove microcystin lr chlorine can oxidise dissolved 53 μg l microcystins efficiently if a sufficient amount of residual chlorine 3 5 mg l and contact time 1 60 min are applied fan et al 2014 an aqueous hclo dosage of 2 mg l degraded 50 μg l microcystin lr to 1 μg l within 40 min but the formation of toxic chlorination by products can be an issue zong et al 2013 chlorine dioxide achieved no significant removal of a prepared microcystin lr in deionised water at 240 mg min l ding et al 2010 both fe ni and fe pd nanoparticles based on nanoscale zero valent iron removed approximately 90 microcystin lr after 120 min in a laboratory experiment gao et al 2016 uv chlorine 1 5 mg l achieved a complete removal of 1 mg l mc lr after 16 min in 10 ml deionised water and the contribution of oh was 39 more than that of 8 uv 27 cl2 and 26 reactive chlorine species respectively duan et al 2018 in this study the oh produced by the strong ionisation discharge degraded whole microcystin lr within 20 s this is because oh has a greater oxidation potential e 0 2 8 v and chemical reaction rate 108 109 m 1s 1 than those of chlorine e 0 1 63 v approximately 10 1 m 1s 1 respectively mahamuni and adewuyi 2010 therefore the oh advanced oxidation exhibits a great potential in the degradation of algal toxins during the removal of cyanobacterial blooms for large scale industrial application 3 5 naclo disinfection in the drinking water system cyanobacterial blooms in water sources such as rivers lakes and reservoirs may cause drastic changes in turbidity ph taste and odour which pose a great challenge to drinking water production in the xiang an drinking water treatment plant naclo was used for the disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms and generated residual disinfectant to prevent microbial regrowth in the water distribution system following the chinese sanitary standards for drinking water gb5749 2006 106 drinking water quality indexes were detected by the xiamen monitoring station of the chinese urban water supply in xiamen of china which had the qualification certification of china inspection body and laboratory mandatory approval cma main indexes are shown in supporting table s1 the ph value of raw water was 7 29 due to the high algae content of 17 9 104 cells ml which was reduced to 7 19 after sand filtration due to the oh pre treatment of algae colonies accordingly the turbidity of raw water 11 8 ntu was decreased to 0 18 ntu after sand filtration during the whole treatment process no taste or odour were detected and the levels of colour conductivity and visible organisms did not change the codmn toc and nh3 n decreased to 1 0 1 74 and 0 02 mg l respectively during coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration pathogenic microorganism indexes such as heterotrophic plate counts total coliform bacteria escherichia coli and thermotolerant coliform bacteria were decreased to 57 cfu ml nd nd and nd respectively after disinfection with 0 5 mg l of naclo the total colonies were decreased to nd in addition the levels of no2 no3 so4 2 cl f and s barely changed and the levels of al fe mn zn and as also did not change both volatile phenols and linear alkylbenzene sulphonate las are widespread global aquatic pollutants volatile phenols can cause harmful effects on the central nervous system heart lungs and kidneys zhang et al 2012 while las might induce genotoxic manifestations by adversely affecting the integrity of dna shukla and trivedi 2018 after disinfection with 0 5 mg l of naclo the levels of both volatile phenols and las were below the limit set by gb5749 2006 of china china 2006 the biological toxicity was measured using photobacterium phosphoreum t3 spp as an indicator organism following chinese standard methods china 1995 which represent the acute toxicity of water the result below zero indicated the safety of the drinking water treated by this process overall during the oh pre treatment 1 0 mg l and naclo disinfection 0 5 mg l of cyanobacterial blooms all 106 drinking water quality indexes complied with chinese sanitary standards for drinking water gb5749 2006 china 2006 3 6 dbps by naclo disinfection the pre oxidation of cyanobacterial blooms releases intracellular compounds that may contribute to the pool of chlorinated dbp precursors assuming that post chlorination is used as a final disinfection process coral et al 2013 the most notable disadvantage of the use of chlorine is that it can react with organics to form by products that are toxic to mammals svrcek and smith 2004 including carcinogenic thms therefore the possible dbp of oh pre treatment and naclo disinfection needs to be analysed based on the china national standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 china 2006 in the 12000 ton day drinking water treatment system cl content of 6 91 mg l and br content of 0 02 mg l were detected in the raw water the dbp data for naclo disinfection at a dosage of 0 5 mg l are shown in table 1 bromate bro3 is a potential carcinogen and its limit in drinking water is below 10 μg l according to the world health organisation who the environmental protection agency epa and gb5749 2006 of china during oh pre treatment bro3 was not detected after naclo disinfection while quantities of 2 6 46 μg l were observed by werschkun werschkun et al 2012 meanwhile there was no change in the level of chlorite clo2 while the level of chlorate clo3 slightly increased to 14 μg l which is much lower than the limit of 700 μg l set by gb5749 2006 moreover methane was not detected while the level of chloral increased to 4 2 μg l which is lower than the 10 μg l set by gb5749 2006 haas which could increase the risk of cancer were analysed in this study no dcaa or tcaa was detected after naclo disinfection xue et al found that the levels of dcaa and tcaa were 14 79 and 22 45 μg l respectively with a free chlorine dosage of 6 mg l after disinfection for 4 h xue et al 2017 thms have been demonstrated to act as strong carcinogens and mutagens to humans and are also intermediates to other dbps bai et al 2018 szczuka et al 2017 after naclo disinfection the tcm dbcm and dcbm contents were slightly increased to 5 4 μg l 2 0 μg l and 4 4 μg l respectively which were much lower than the limits of 60 μg l 100 μg l and 60 μg l set by gb5749 2006 furthermore no tbm dcm and dce were detected however the thms content reached 190 μg l which is much lower than the 1000 μg l set by gb5749 2006 but 2 4 times that of the 80 μg l regulated by the epa drinking water standards and health advisories hua hua and reckhow 2007 reported that the levels of thms were 110 240 μg l in different natural surface waters with a cl2 dosage of 0 5 mg l and disinfection for 48 h in summary during the oh pre treatment and naclo disinfection of cyanobacterial blooms at a capacity of 12 000 ton day the total dbp contents were much lower than chinese sanitary standards for drinking water gb5749 2006 4 conclusions during the bloom season at xiang an drinking water treatment plant xiamen china a large oh yield equipment which oxygen activated species generated by the strong ionisation discharge were combined with the effect of water jet cavitation to form oh at a concentration of 7 76 57 8 μmol l was developed and installed after coagulation settling in a 12000 ton day treatment system with compared to common pre treatment oxidants the oh technology exhibited great potential for large scale drinking water treatment in the removal of cyanobacterial blooms while retaining cell integrity as well as the degradation of toxins the main results are as follows 1 for oh pre treatment at a dose of 1 0 mg l the cyanobacterial blooms were inactivated during the process of conveying bloom water within 20 s and then removed by sand filtration for naclo pre treatment 3780 cells ml of living algae persistent which could transport through sand filtration and enter supply networks reducing the safety of drinking water 2 according to the observation of cyanobacterial cell integrity by sem for oh inactivation the dominant microcystis sp colonies connected by mucilage were dispersed into individuals that retained their shape indicating no release of iom for 2 h of naclo inactivation algae cells were still connected by mucilage but many were deformed and ruptured according to the analyses of dna damage using a flow cytometer with oh inactivation 94 22 of algal cells were identified to have broken dna strands however with naclo inactivation treated for 2 h only 36 70 algae were identified to have broken dna strands therefore the main cause of inactivation by oh was the breakage of the dna strand while by naclo was the extensive destruction of cell membranes resulting in the release of intracellular algal toxins 3 whether oh or naclo pre treatment would induce the release of intracellular

18973,aerosolized reclaimed water can cause inflammatory responses in lung after inhalation and endotoxin has been identified as the main inducer since the effects of disinfection treatments on endotoxins had conflicting results this study explored the changes of endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of reference endotoxin gram negative bacteria solutions and reclaimed water after ozonation respectively and found that lal assay based endotoxin activity and mouse inhalation exposure based inflammation examination had inconsistent results the excessive ozone could not remove the endotoxin activity but was able to reduce the inflammation inducing ability of free endotoxin when treating on gram negative strains ozone first released the cell bound endotoxin and caused the dramatic increase of endotoxin activity but for the inflammatory response despite the rapid increase at the very beginning it immediately dropped back with further ozonation the endotoxin aggregate size was proposed as a key regulator of the toxicity of endotoxin which was modified by ozone oxidation in real reclaimed water insufficient ozone significantly enhanced the inflammatory response but when the ozone dosages were large enough the inflammation could be drawn back to the original level which was consistent with the observations from pure endotoxin and bacteria this work demonstrates that the endotoxin activity cannot predict the endotoxin induced toxicity of ozone treated water and low dosage of ozone treatment may even increase the health risk of reclaimed water

introduction municipal wastewater can be treated into reclaimed water to alleviate the water shortage the reclaimed water is being used to irrigate landscapes wash vehicles clean streets flush toilet and so on in urban area during these applications the reclaimed water is aerosolized and inhaled by surrounding people which may threaten public health dickin et al 2016 sano et al 2016 hamilton et al 2018 there are many pollutants in the reclaimed water that can cause health problem toxic chemicals have been studied for their risk through ingestion and inhalation however the exposure quantity of reclaimed water is usually small xie et al 2009 the car wash workers have been reported not to have significant chemical associated risk by exposing reclaimed water daily wu et al 2013 and the dosages of occupational exposure and public exposure in park irrigation were reported as 70 ml d per person for occupational exposure and 40 50 ml d per person for the public he et al 2006 pathogens such as legionella pneumophila salmonella spp cryptosporidium and giardia are well studied for their high risks hamilton et al 2018 santiago et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 nevertheless they are an extremely small fraction of total microorganisms in the reclaimed water mcbride et al 2013 whether the large amount of non pathogenic microbes and their derivatives can cause health problem has been neglected for a long time according to a recent report endotoxin could be a critical risk factor in reclaimed water via inhalation exposure which leads to strong inflammatory responses in mouse lungs xue et al 2016 endotoxin refers to lipopolysaccharide lps a component of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria which is mainly released by the bacteria after death the backbones of lps consist of a hydrophobic lipid part and a hydrophilic polysaccharide part the hydrophobic lipid part called lipid a is responsible of the endotoxic effect of lps and its structure is highly conserved among species calabrese et al 2015 the hydrophilic polysaccharide is usually composed of o specific polysaccharide and core oligosaccharide calabrese et al 2015 but the rough type lps doesn t have o specific polysaccharide part kilar et al 2013 different species have different o specific chains bergstrand et al 2006 but the core oligosaccharides don t have obvious specificity the outer core is composed of hexose such as glucose galactose n acetylglucosamine or n acetylgalactosamine raetz and whitfield 2002 while some kinds of special saccharide usually exist in the inner core such as glyceryl d mannitol and 2 ketone 3 deoxy d mannitol gluconic acid kilar et al 2013 the quantity of lps is usually expressed as eu endotoxin unit by testing endotoxin activity with limulus amoebocyte lysate lal assay evans et al 1978 one eu means the minimum promoting gel activity value of standard limulus lysate agent the molecular weight of endotoxin monomer was 10 20 kd petsch and anspach 2000 bergstrand et al 2006 because of their amphipathicity the endotoxins usually form aggregates the sizes of which are about 1000 kd in water hirayama and sakata 2002 the endotoxin is a strong immune stimulating factor which has no pathogenic effect but can induce inflammatory mediators and cytokines in target cells for most environmental exposures the target cells are epithelial cells and immune cells in the respiratory system there were many cases concerning damages of endotoxin on living bodies via inhalation exposure such as the changes of relevant gene expression in lung tissues oshikawa and sugiyama 2003 increase of neutrophils lymphocytes and fibronectin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in acute exposure sandstrom et al 1992 nelson et al 2018 changes on the lung development of neonatal mice kulhankova et al 2012 induction of prefibrogenic lesion xue et al 2018 and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd lee et al 2009 when lps is inhaled it activates alveolar macrophages and some other cells with tlr4 receptor in the respiratory tract many in vitro studies had demonstrated that incubation of alveolar macrophages with lps results in the rapid induction of synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf α interleukin 1 il l and numerous lipid mediators including platelet activating factor stolk et al 1992 these cytokines can recruit neutrophil cells from the blood which become polymorphonuclear cells in lung wesselius et al 1997 de souza xavier costa et al 2017 in a previous study seven inflammation related cytokines il 1β il 6 il 10 tnf α ifn β ifn γ and tgf β three mucosal proteins surfactant proteins a and d and mucoprotein 5ac pmn percentage in lavage and total white blood cells in whole blood and lavage were all examined when a reclaimed water was used for exposure xue et al 2016 the pmn percentage in lavage appeared as the most sensitive test endpoint this result was also consistent with other studies on lps exposure in human and animals which demonstrated that lps induced lung inflammation is pmn dominant wesselius et al 1997 de souza xavier costa et al 2017 endotoxin level is relatively high in the reclaimed water the average value of endotoxin activity in reclaimed water was 1584 eu ml and the median value was 422 eu ml reported by published papers from 1976 to 2013 huang et al 2013 inhalation is the main exposure route when the reclaimed water is used in urban area and aerosols are generated therefore it is necessary to remove or inactivate endotoxin in the reclaimed water to a safe level the effects of some traditional water disinfection treatments on endotoxin have been studied chlorination could not decrease the endotoxin activity assessed by lal assay sometimes even made it up slightly in filtered water samples from wastewater treatment plants wwtp gehr et al 2008 the similar tendency was observed on the secondary effluent huang et al 2011a b the treatment by medium pressure uv lamp alone can significantly remove the endotoxin activity with high radiation intensity anderson et al 2003 but the lps activity cannot be remove efficiently by low pressure uv lamp below 150 mj cm2 huang et al 2011a b the removal rates of endotoxin activity by ozone were not consistent by different labs which might be due to multiple factors influencing the efficiency of ozonation the removal efficiency of endotoxin achieved more than 50 when the untreated activity was under 10 eu ml and the removal efficiency could be improved by higher dosage gehr et al 2008 interestingly another study demonstrated that the ozone treated endotoxin removal efficiency was much lower whether in free endotoxin solution or natural water oh et al 2014 a potential critical factor between the contradictory results might be the ph when the ph of ozone solution reaches a critical value or above concentration of hydroxyl radical increased and even became the important oxidant hoigen and bader 1976 the advanced oxidation processes aops stimulated by ozone plus hydrogen peroxide or hydrogen peroxide plus uv both could remove the activity of endotoxin more efficiently because of the unselective and strong oxidability of the hydroxyl radical oh et al 2014 however all the studies above only applied lal assay but the test on mice showed that the endotoxin activity had opposite change compared to the inflammation inducing ability after chlorination zhang et al 2016 and there was no correlation of the lal activity with the cytokine expression in whole blood assay dehus et al 2006 which indicate that lal assay cannot tell the actual toxicity of endotoxin this is because lal assay is based on the biochemical reaction between endotoxins and horseshoe crab reagents while the toxicity which is most important when health risk is concerned is tested by mammals or their cells the two responses have completely different mechanisms therefore it is necessary to reassess the toxicity removal of different treatments ozonation has lots of advantages such as producing less halogenated dbps compared with chlorination having stronger oxidizability and being able to remove color and odor which make it a promising disinfection technology this study studied the effects of ozonation on the endotoxin activity and the inflammation inducing ability of reference endotoxin gram negative bacteria suspensions and reclaimed water samples and the mechanisms of toxicity change of oxidized lps were also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples three kinds of water were used in this study artificial water sample of reference endotoxin artificial water samples of gram negative bacteria and real reclaimed water samples for endotoxin solution 5 mg commercial reference lps l2637 sigma aldrich st louis mo from escherichia coli o55 b5 was added into 2 ml deionized water and the high concentration solution was stored at 4 c as a stock its endotoxin activity was relatively stable for at least 3 months the endotoxin level of the working solution for ozonation study was about 3000 eu ml which was diluted by deionized water from the stock three pure cultures of gram negative bacteria isolated from reclaimed water e coli x1 enterobacter aerogenes x4 and klebsiella pneumonia x5 xue et al 2016 were used to make the artificial bacteria water samples the bacteria were streaked on the nutrient agar plate incubated at 37 c for 24 h the single colonies were incubated in lb broth at 37 c 180 rpm for 18 h the cultures were pelleted at 10000 rpm for 1 min and washed twice with deionized water to remove the free endotoxin then the suspended bacteria solutions were diluted by deionized water for subsequent experiments the final concentrations of suspended bacteria solutions were around 5 106 cfu ml reclaimed water samples were named as p l and r sample p was the effluent of mbr process of a reclaimed water plant in beijing sample l and r were lake in olympic forest park 40 0 44 63 n 116

around all of the water samples were free of chlorination or other oxidation the water samples were transported to the lab within 2 h stored at 4 c all the experiments were finished within 7 days in case of undesired changes the reclaimed water samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min to remove large particles to make the acute inflammatory response significant sample r was further concentrated by ultrafiltration through a 100 kd filter water quality indices before and after ultrafiltration are shown in table s1 which increased the level of endotoxin and bacteria dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were measured by the total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan for the heterotrophic plate count hpc 1 ml diluted or undiluted water samples were added into the nutrient agar medium and placed at 37 c for 48 h after solidification chinese national standard gb t 5750 12 2006 the method to measure the endotoxin activity was the standard lal assay described in section 2 3 the water quality indices were listed in table 1 2 2 ozonation treatment the aerator of the ozone generator bjsmsm ltd china was put into a clean conical flask containing 300 ml deionized water the process was performed on ice to achieve high concentration of ozone when the ozone water nearly got saturated usually 35 45 mg l the concentration of ozone was detected by the n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine dpd4 regent palintest uk phosphate buffer was added to water samples to maintain ph 7 then the ozone solution was added to the desired concentrations and deionized water was added as control the surplus ozone was quenched by the sodium thiosulfate solution the molar quantity of which was 1 5 times of the highest ozone dosage sodium thiosulfate solution with 30 mg l had no effects on pmn percentage and lal assay data not shown 2 3 endotoxin activity measurement the activities of all the water samples were determined by a chromogenic lal assay following the manufacturer s instructions endpoint chromogenic assay kit cat no ec64405s xiamen houshiji ltd xiamen china briefly 50 μl of standard solutions or water samples were added to the wells of a 96 well microplate every sample had three dilutions and each dilution was tested in duplicate the analytical range of the kit is 0 1 1 eu ml then 50 μl of limulus lysate agent were added to each well and incubated at 37 c for 10 min the color reaction was developed by adding 100 μl of a chromogenic agent and incubating the mixture for an additional 6 min finally 50 μl of stop solution were added and the light absorbance was read at 405 nm all glassware used for the endotoxin activity tests and exposure was baked at 250 c for 6 h to remove pyrogen all other products used in the tests e g pipet tips were also pyrogen free 2 4 inhalation toxicity detection 2 4 1 animals imprinting control region icr male mice 8 9 weeks old were purchased from the vital river company beijing china and maintained in the center of biomedical analysis of tsinghua university animal maintenance and experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee iacuc of tsinghua university which is a branch of the beijing animal care and use committee all experiments were reviewed and approved by the iacuc permit 16 ly1 and all efforts were made to minimize the suffering of test animals 2 4 2 inhalation exposure the exposure was performed in a plastic chamber which was linked with an air pump and a nebulizer with water samples the air was pumped through a filter to remove particulate matters and a dry column to remove humidity this clean and dry air was used as the carrier gas the nebulized water was mixed with the carrier flow to make the increase of relative humidity in the chamber around 50 the concentration of sample water in air was about 11 5 g m³ and the exposure lasted for 3 h considering parameters of this study the dose is 0 62 g kg for every times of exposure patlolla et al 2010 2 4 3 collection of animal samples the animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation 3 h after exposure at which time was demonstrated to have the highest polymorphonuclear cell pmn response in lung fig s1 2 ml of pbs with 0 5 bsa was injected into the lung to get the bronchioalveolar lavage fluid balf the balf quality was determined by the number of red blood cells measured by animal hematology analyzer mindray china which should be less than 0 1 1012 l 1 to ensure that the wbc contamination from blood leakage is less than 5 2 4 4 pmn counting the balf was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min the supernatant was removed and the precipitate was resuspended with 10 μl pbs which was made into a smear on a slide shitai china dried in the hood and stained by wright giemsa staining zhang et al 2016 later at least 300 white blood cells were counted under a light microscope leica microsystems gmbh wetzlar germany for each sample to make the counting statistically significant 2 5 molecular characterization 2 5 1 1h nmr spectroscopy the samples concentration for nmr were 1 mg ml lps l2637 sigma samples before and after ozone disinfection were dialyzed to deionized water by 7 kd dialysis cassette pierce biotechnology usa to remove salt and freeze dried 2 mg of samples were dissolved in 0 5 ml d2o and performed on the nmr spectroscopy model eca 600 jeol ltd japan the spectra were read and integrated by mestrenova version 12 mestrelab research 2 5 2 ftir spectroscopy the sample treatments were the same as which for nmr after the freeze dry the lps powder was mixed with dry potassium bromide and tableted for testing on the ftir thermo nicolet nexus 2 5 3 aggregate size determination ozone treated and untreated 0 01 mg ml 81000 eu ml of lps was prepared for aggregate size determination on zeta potential analyzer beckman coulter usa 2 6 statistical analysis data were analyzed using excel version 2016 microsoft with t test hypothesis of equal variance double tailed and unpaired and the data were shown as means sd standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ozonation on a reference endotoxin disinfection process may change the biological activity of endotoxin a reference lps was tested and its endotoxin activity was found to slightly increase but not significantly after 30 min ozonation fig 1 however the pmn proportions in balf of mice exposed by the treated water samples decreased dramatically which reflects the removal of inflammation inducing ability the oxidative reaction mainly occurred within the first 5 min longer time could not further reduce the inflammation inducing ability to the background level the pmn percentage of which was about 0 5 it should be noticed that the dosage of ozone 2 mg l was far more than enough for the reaction since the lps concentration was only 235 μg l and when the contact time lasted for 30 min residue ozone could still be detected in the system which proved that the ozone was relatively excessive these results were similar to what were observed in the chlorination of the reference lps zhang et al 2016 the endotoxin activity and inflammation indicator went in the opposite directions and the inflammation inducing ability could not be completely removed although the final lavage pmn of ozonation 8 was lower than the 43 pmn from chlorination the inflammation induced by the untreated endotoxin in the previous study zhang et al 2016 was also much higher than that in this study which might partially explain the distinction whether ozonation is better than chlorination on the removal of inflammation inducing ability needs strictly parallel comparison to find out what caused the reduction of inflammation inducing ability the lps molecular changes were measured by zeta potential analysis h nmr and ftir after the ozone treatment zhang et al 2016 reported that the average size of lps aggregates significantly decreased after chlorination by zeta potential which can roughly describe the size of a particle similarly the large size lps aggregates became smaller with the increase of ozone treatment time fig 2 this result further supports the hypothesis that the aggregate size maybe one of the factors influencing the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of lps one unclear thing is that the inflammatory response dropped immediately after ozonation fig 1 but the aggregate size went down much slower fig 2 the possible reason could be the concentration of lps for the size measurement was much larger than that of the exposure experiment in order to achieve significant signal on zeta potential analyzer larger concentration allows the formation of larger aggregates the ozonation was supposed to be sufficient since the residual concentration of ozone after the 10 min reaction was 0 5 mg l another possible reason of toxicity removal could be the chemical modification of the lps caused by ozone the h nmr was used to analyze the changes of hydrogen atoms on lps fig 3 lps molecule has three main groups of hydrogen peaks the hydrogens between the chemical shift 1 and 2 ppm are mainly on the alkyl chains while the hydrogens with the chemical shift ranged from 3 3 to 4 5 ppm are on saccharide rings zahringer et al 2014 when the peak area was normalized by the right group hydrogen quantities of the other two groups decreased especially for the hydrogens on saccharide rings the alkyl chain is relatively stable in the lps molecule that is the reason why its hydrogen was chosen for normalization and the loss of hydrogen in other parts of lps also supported this idea zhang et al 2016 found that chlorination of lps caused hydrogen loss and the hydrogen was usually substituted by chlorine ozone should have different mechanism it can add oxygen to an organic compound to form a hydroxyl group jeong et al 2010 tay et al 2010 some hydroxyl groups can be further oxidized to aldehyde or keto groups and even carboxyl groups von gunten 2003 jeong et al 2010 aimi et al 2005 during the oxidative reaction the hydrogen is removed but which sites on lps are most sensitive is not very clear the best way to know that is to synthesize a simple model r form lps without o antigen for 2d nmr analysis further study is needed to accomplish this aim the above results were further confirmed by ftir spectra fig 4 ozone treatment introduced several new or more chemical groups into lps we presumed that they were hydroxyl group 3750 cm 1 aldehyde or keto group 1725 cm 1 carbon nitrogen triple bond 2118 cm 1 respectively these chemical groups implied the addition of oxygen and loss of hydrogen the saccharide ring can be oxidized to generate new hydroxyl group kishimoto 1996 oxidation can also cause dehydrogenation which is demonstrated in previous studies li et al 2016 xu et al 2017 both ozonation and chlorination can introduce electronegative atoms to the lps molecule which increases the molecular polarity this could be one of the reasons reducing the size of lps aggregates and the size of lps has been proved to be crucial to the inflammation inducing ability the cell wall bound lps and small aggregate both have lower ability to trigger the innate immune system compared with the normal lps aggregates in the solution zhang et al 2016 xue et al 2016 why cell wall bound lps is not sensitive to the immune system and what the most sensitive lps form is still unclear an aggregate size between several dozens to several hundreds of nanometers seems to be most potent immunogen form however the aggregate size is also influenced by many factors like lps concentration temperature presence of cations detergents surfactant and chelators bergstrand et al 2006 pontes et al 2012 keese et al 2014 hirayama and sakata 2002 3 2 effects of ozonation on gram negative bacteria gram negative bacterium is the major source of natural lps while gram positive cell does not contain lps one single cell of e coli bacterium may release about two million molecular of lps when fractured gorbet and sefton 2005 and about 99 of bacteria in the reclaimed water are gram negative xue et al 2016 three gram negative bacteria e coli x1 enterobacter aerogenes x4 and klebsiella pneumonia x5 from secondary effluent isolated by the previous study were used as test strains the endotoxin activities of the bacterial suspensions after two washes were all below 100 eu ml when the concentrated ozone solution was added into the suspensions the bacteria were completely inactivated rapidly within 1 min fig s2 demonstrating the enough quantity of ozone and the cell wall bound endotoxins were released in a short time which caused a dramatic increase of endotoxin activities of filtered solution fig s3 then the released free endotoxin further reacted with ozone which made the endotoxin activity continue to increase or decrease slightly the inflammation inducing abilities of the bacteria suspensions were relatively weak even though the concentration of bacteria were considerably high fig 5 when adding ozone solution into the system the pmn proportions reached the highest levels after 1 min for all three strains but the endotoxin activities were still in relatively low levels fig 5 when the endotoxin activities rose up to the top the inflammation inducing ability already fell back to the original levels these results demonstrated once again the discrepancy between lal assay and the in vivo toxicity test proposed by the previous study zhang et al 2016 the lal assay cannot tell the toxicity of lps especially after oxidative treatment and it even cannot tell the absolute quantity of lps because of the different endotoxin activities in different forms toxicity test or other functional tests are necessary when health risk is concerned in treated reclaimed water functional tests for animals have been applied in some studies such as airway responsiveness card et al 2006 central airway resistance lai et al 2012 but functional responses are not as sensitive as toxicity indexes for human lung function indexes and inflammation parameters can all be tested for evaluation of possible human inhalation risks moller et al 2012 lung function indexes usually include the first second of forced expiration fev1 to the full forced vital capacity fvc bronchial hyperresponsiveness bhr peak expiratory flow pef and inflammation parameters usually include eno exhaled nitric oxide c reactive protein crp and neutrophil counts in blood samples 3 3 effects of ozonation on reclaimed water free endotoxin and gram negative bacteria both exist in reclaimed water according to the results above ozonation on free endotoxin decreases its inflammation inducing ability while insufficient ozonation on gram negative bacteria solution increases the inflammatory response therefore in reclaimed water ozone reacts with both the free endotoxin and gram negative bacteria making the overall effects largely unknown and many organics other than endotoxin and bacteria in reclaimed water can also react with ozone which makes the results even more unpredictable therefore different ozone dosages and three reclaimed water samples from different sources table 1 were tested based on the results above the reaction of ozonation finished within 5 min thus ozonation on reclaimed water was designed for 10 min due to the limited concentration of ozone solution generated by the ozone maker the ozone dosages could not be higher than 17 5 mg l since the large volume of ozone solution would dilute the water sample too much to weaken the response after acute exposure a relatively low dosage of ozone could enhance both of the endotoxin activities and the inflammation inducing abilities of three reclaimed water fig 6 when the ozone dosage was large enough the inflammatory response decreased but still could not be lower than that of the untreated water these results were not surprising because low dosage of ozone could release lps from the living bacteria but was not enough to inactivate their inflammation inducing ability and when the ozone dosage was higher the free endotoxin could be further oxidized in a reported event lifeguards in a swimming pool felt chest tightening shortness of breath and sluggishness the possible main reason was the endotoxin in pools aerosolized and inhaled by the lifeguards due to the fan sprays and wall spouts however in another two pools the endotoxin levels were even higher but the lifeguards had no symptoms which would be an evidence of adverse health effects caused by aerosolized endotoxin inhalation after installation of an ozone treatment system the endotoxin level decreased dramatically and the symptoms of lifeguards disappeared which is critical for us to demonstrate the effects of ozonation on degrading the symptoms caused by endotoxin mcgregor et al 1993 in that case the ozone dose could be much higher with ozone bubbling treatment than the dose in this work however the three samples also showed apparent differences between each other for example the inflammation inducing ability of l was increased a lot after treatment and it could be reduced back easily fig 6b while the overall changes of p were relatively small fig 6a and r showed the highest initial potential and strong resistance to ozonation fig 6c for the untreated samples the levels of pmn was positively correlated to their original endotoxin activities which fits the finding of the previous study xue et al 2016 nevertheless the trend of pmn reduction could not be easily read from the water quality indices no single index could match the reduction pattern doc nh3 n and bacteria in the water all can consume ozone which one is the main contributor still needs further study fortunately when the bacteria inactivation of the three samples was checked it showed similar trend as the reduction of inflammation fig 7 the bacteria in sample r was most difficult to be inactivated which was consistent with the highest requirement of ozone for inflammation reduction although why sample r was so special is unknown what can be confirmed is something in the water consumed more ozone leading to both the low bacterial inactivation and inflammation reduction 4 conclusions this work reveals that ozonation can release the lps on gram negative bacteria cause the increase of endotoxin activity and simultaneously oxidize the lps leading to the reduction of aggregate size and inflammation inducing ability the ozone treatment cannot significantly remove the inflammation inducing ability in the reclaimed water and may even increase the inhalation health risk when ozone dosage is not enough which

3 deoxy d mannitol gluconic acid kilar et al 2013 the quantity of lps is usually expressed as eu endotoxin unit by testing endotoxin activity with limulus amoebocyte lysate lal assay evans et al 1978 one eu means the minimum promoting gel activity value of standard limulus lysate agent the molecular weight of endotoxin monomer was 10 20 kd petsch and anspach 2000 bergstrand et al 2006 because of their amphipathicity the endotoxins usually form aggregates the sizes of which are about 1000 kd in water hirayama and sakata 2002 the endotoxin is a strong immune stimulating factor which has no pathogenic effect but can induce inflammatory mediators and cytokines in target cells for most environmental exposures the target cells are epithelial cells and immune cells in the respiratory system there were many cases concerning damages of endotoxin on living bodies via inhalation exposure such as the changes of relevant gene expression in lung tissues oshikawa and sugiyama 2003 increase of neutrophils lymphocytes and fibronectin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in acute exposure sandstrom et al 1992 nelson et al 2018 changes on the lung development of neonatal mice kulhankova et al 2012 induction of prefibrogenic lesion xue et al 2018 and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd lee et al 2009 when lps is inhaled it activates alveolar macrophages and some other cells with tlr4 receptor in the respiratory tract many in vitro studies had demonstrated that incubation of alveolar macrophages with lps results in the rapid induction of synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf α interleukin 1 il l and numerous lipid mediators including platelet activating factor stolk et al 1992 these cytokines can recruit neutrophil cells from the blood which become polymorphonuclear cells in lung wesselius et al 1997 de souza xavier costa et al 2017 in a previous study seven inflammation related cytokines il 1β il 6 il 10 tnf α ifn β ifn γ and tgf β three mucosal proteins surfactant proteins a and d and mucoprotein 5ac pmn percentage in lavage and total white blood cells in whole blood and lavage were all examined when a reclaimed water was used for exposure xue et al 2016 the pmn percentage in lavage appeared as the most sensitive test endpoint this result was also consistent with other studies on lps exposure in human and animals which demonstrated that lps induced lung inflammation is pmn dominant wesselius et al 1997 de souza xavier costa et al 2017 endotoxin level is relatively high in the reclaimed water the average value of endotoxin activity in reclaimed water was 1584 eu ml and the median value was 422 eu ml reported by published papers from 1976 to 2013 huang et al 2013 inhalation is the main exposure route when the reclaimed water is used in urban area and aerosols are generated therefore it is necessary to remove or inactivate endotoxin in the reclaimed water to a safe level the effects of some traditional water disinfection treatments on endotoxin have been studied chlorination could not decrease the endotoxin activity assessed by lal assay sometimes even made it up slightly in filtered water samples from wastewater treatment plants wwtp gehr et al 2008 the similar tendency was observed on the secondary effluent huang et al 2011a b the treatment by medium pressure uv lamp alone can significantly remove the endotoxin activity with high radiation intensity anderson et al 2003 but the lps activity cannot be remove efficiently by low pressure uv lamp below 150 mj cm2 huang et al 2011a b the removal rates of endotoxin activity by ozone were not consistent by different labs which might be due to multiple factors influencing the efficiency of ozonation the removal efficiency of endotoxin achieved more than 50 when the untreated activity was under 10 eu ml and the removal efficiency could be improved by higher dosage gehr et al 2008 interestingly another study demonstrated that the ozone treated endotoxin removal efficiency was much lower whether in free endotoxin solution or natural water oh et al 2014 a potential critical factor between the contradictory results might be the ph when the ph of ozone solution reaches a critical value or above concentration of hydroxyl radical increased and even became the important oxidant hoigen and bader 1976 the advanced oxidation processes aops stimulated by ozone plus hydrogen peroxide or hydrogen peroxide plus uv both could remove the activity of endotoxin more efficiently because of the unselective and strong oxidability of the hydroxyl radical oh et al 2014 however all the studies above only applied lal assay but the test on mice showed that the endotoxin activity had opposite change compared to the inflammation inducing ability after chlorination zhang et al 2016 and there was no correlation of the lal activity with the cytokine expression in whole blood assay dehus et al 2006 which indicate that lal assay cannot tell the actual toxicity of endotoxin this is because lal assay is based on the biochemical reaction between endotoxins and horseshoe crab reagents while the toxicity which is most important when health risk is concerned is tested by mammals or their cells the two responses have completely different mechanisms therefore it is necessary to reassess the toxicity removal of different treatments ozonation has lots of advantages such as producing less halogenated dbps compared with chlorination having stronger oxidizability and being able to remove color and odor which make it a promising disinfection technology this study studied the effects of ozonation on the endotoxin activity and the inflammation inducing ability of reference endotoxin gram negative bacteria suspensions and reclaimed water samples and the mechanisms of toxicity change of oxidized lps were also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples three kinds of water were used in this study artificial water sample of reference endotoxin artificial water samples of gram negative bacteria and real reclaimed water samples for endotoxin solution 5 mg commercial reference lps l2637 sigma aldrich st louis mo from escherichia coli o55 b5 was added into 2 ml deionized water and the high concentration solution was stored at 4 c as a stock its endotoxin activity was relatively stable for at least 3 months the endotoxin level of the working solution for ozonation study was about 3000 eu ml which was diluted by deionized water from the stock three pure cultures of gram negative bacteria isolated from reclaimed water e coli x1 enterobacter aerogenes x4 and klebsiella pneumonia x5 xue et al 2016 were used to make the artificial bacteria water samples the bacteria were streaked on the nutrient agar plate incubated at 37 c for 24 h the single colonies were incubated in lb broth at 37 c 180 rpm for 18 h the cultures were pelleted at 10000 rpm for 1 min and washed twice with deionized water to remove the free endotoxin then the suspended bacteria solutions were diluted by deionized water for subsequent experiments the final concentrations of suspended bacteria solutions were around 5 106 cfu ml reclaimed water samples were named as p l and r sample p was the effluent of mbr process of a reclaimed water plant in beijing sample l and r were lake in olympic forest park 40 0 44 63 n 116

around all of the water samples were free of chlorination or other oxidation the water samples were transported to the lab within 2 h stored at 4 c all the experiments were finished within 7 days in case of undesired changes the reclaimed water samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min to remove large particles to make the acute inflammatory response significant sample r was further concentrated by ultrafiltration through a 100 kd filter water quality indices before and after ultrafiltration are shown in table s1 which increased the level of endotoxin and bacteria dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were measured by the total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan for the heterotrophic plate count hpc 1 ml diluted or undiluted water samples were added into the nutrient agar medium and placed at 37 c for 48 h after solidification chinese national standard gb t 5750 12 2006 the method to measure the endotoxin activity was the standard lal assay described in section 2 3 the water quality indices were listed in table 1 2 2 ozonation treatment the aerator of the ozone generator bjsmsm ltd china was put into a clean conical flask containing 300 ml deionized water the process was performed on ice to achieve high concentration of ozone when the ozone water nearly got saturated usually 35 45 mg l the concentration of ozone was detected by the n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine dpd4 regent palintest uk phosphate buffer was added to water samples to maintain ph 7 then the ozone solution was added to the desired concentrations and deionized water was added as control the surplus ozone was quenched by the sodium thiosulfate solution the molar quantity of which was 1 5 times of the highest ozone dosage sodium thiosulfate solution with 30 mg l had no effects on pmn percentage and lal assay data not shown 2 3 endotoxin activity measurement the activities of all the water samples were determined by a chromogenic lal assay following the manufacturer s instructions endpoint chromogenic assay kit cat no ec64405s xiamen houshiji ltd xiamen china briefly 50 μl of standard solutions or water samples were added to the wells of a 96 well microplate every sample had three dilutions and each dilution was tested in duplicate the analytical range of the kit is 0 1 1 eu ml then 50 μl of limulus lysate agent were added to each well and incubated at 37 c for 10 min the color reaction was developed by adding 100 μl of a chromogenic agent and incubating the mixture for an additional 6 min finally 50 μl of stop solution were added and the light absorbance was read at 405 nm all glassware used for the endotoxin activity tests and exposure was baked at 250 c for 6 h to remove pyrogen all other products used in the tests e g pipet tips were also pyrogen free 2 4 inhalation toxicity detection 2 4 1 animals imprinting control region icr male mice 8 9 weeks old were purchased from the vital river company beijing china and maintained in the center of biomedical analysis of tsinghua university animal maintenance and experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee iacuc of tsinghua university which is a branch of the beijing animal care and use committee all experiments were reviewed and approved by the iacuc permit 16 ly1 and all efforts were made to minimize the suffering of test animals 2 4 2 inhalation exposure the exposure was performed in a plastic chamber which was linked with an air pump and a nebulizer with water samples the air was pumped through a filter to remove particulate matters and a dry column to remove humidity this clean and dry air was used as the carrier gas the nebulized water was mixed with the carrier flow to make the increase of relative humidity in the chamber around 50 the concentration of sample water in air was about 11 5 g m³ and the exposure lasted for 3 h considering parameters of this study the dose is 0 62 g kg for every times of exposure patlolla et al 2010 2 4 3 collection of animal samples the animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation 3 h after exposure at which time was demonstrated to have the highest polymorphonuclear cell pmn response in lung fig s1 2 ml of pbs with 0 5 bsa was injected into the lung to get the bronchioalveolar lavage fluid balf the balf quality was determined by the number of red blood cells measured by animal hematology analyzer mindray china which should be less than 0 1 1012 l 1 to ensure that the wbc contamination from blood leakage is less than 5 2 4 4 pmn counting the balf was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min the supernatant was removed and the precipitate was resuspended with 10 μl pbs which was made into a smear on a slide shitai china dried in the hood and stained by wright giemsa staining zhang et al 2016 later at least 300 white blood cells were counted under a light microscope leica microsystems gmbh wetzlar germany for each sample to make the counting statistically significant 2 5 molecular characterization 2 5 1 1h nmr spectroscopy the samples concentration for nmr were 1 mg ml lps l2637 sigma samples before and after ozone disinfection were dialyzed to deionized water by 7 kd dialysis cassette pierce biotechnology usa to remove salt and freeze dried 2 mg of samples were dissolved in 0 5 ml d2o and performed on the nmr spectroscopy model eca 600 jeol ltd japan the spectra were read and integrated by mestrenova version 12 mestrelab research 2 5 2 ftir spectroscopy the sample treatments were the same as which for nmr after the freeze dry the lps powder was mixed with dry potassium bromide and tableted for testing on the ftir thermo nicolet nexus 2 5 3 aggregate size determination ozone treated and untreated 0 01 mg ml 81000 eu ml of lps was prepared for aggregate size determination on zeta potential analyzer beckman coulter usa 2 6 statistical analysis data were analyzed using excel version 2016 microsoft with t test hypothesis of equal variance double tailed and unpaired and the data were shown as means sd standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ozonation on a reference endotoxin disinfection process may change the biological activity of endotoxin a reference lps was tested and its endotoxin activity was found to slightly increase but not significantly after 30 min ozonation fig 1 however the pmn proportions in balf of mice exposed by the treated water samples decreased dramatically which reflects the removal of inflammation inducing ability the oxidative reaction mainly occurred within the first 5 min longer time could not further reduce the inflammation inducing ability to the background level the pmn percentage of which was about 0 5 it should be noticed that the dosage of ozone 2 mg l was far more than enough for the reaction since the lps concentration was only 235 μg l and when the contact time lasted for 30 min residue ozone could still be detected in the system which proved that the ozone was relatively excessive these results were similar to what were observed in the chlorination of the reference lps zhang et al 2016 the endotoxin activity and inflammation indicator went in the opposite directions and the inflammation inducing ability could not be completely removed although the final lavage pmn of ozonation 8 was lower than the 43 pmn from chlorination the inflammation induced by the untreated endotoxin in the previous study zhang et al 2016 was also much higher than that in this study which might partially explain the distinction whether ozonation is better than chlorination on the removal of inflammation inducing ability needs strictly parallel comparison to find out what caused the reduction of inflammation inducing ability the lps molecular changes were measured by zeta potential analysis h nmr and ftir after the ozone treatment zhang et al 2016 reported that the average size of lps aggregates significantly decreased after chlorination by zeta potential which can roughly describe the size of a particle similarly the large size lps aggregates became smaller with the increase of ozone treatment time fig 2 this result further supports the hypothesis that the aggregate size maybe one of the factors influencing the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of lps one unclear thing is that the inflammatory response dropped immediately after ozonation fig 1 but the aggregate size went down much slower fig 2 the possible reason could be the concentration of lps for the size measurement was much larger than that of the exposure experiment in order to achieve significant signal on zeta potential analyzer larger concentration allows the formation of larger aggregates the ozonation was supposed to be sufficient since the residual concentration of ozone after the 10 min reaction was 0 5 mg l another possible reason of toxicity removal could be the chemical modification of the lps caused by ozone the h nmr was used to analyze the changes of hydrogen atoms on lps fig 3 lps molecule has three main groups of hydrogen peaks the hydrogens between the chemical shift 1 and 2 ppm are mainly on the alkyl chains while the hydrogens with the chemical shift ranged from 3 3 to 4 5 ppm are on saccharide rings zahringer et al 2014 when the peak area was normalized by the right group hydrogen quantities of the other two groups decreased especially for the hydrogens on saccharide rings the alkyl chain is relatively stable in the lps molecule that is the reason why its hydrogen was chosen for normalization and the loss of hydrogen in other parts of lps also supported this idea zhang et al 2016 found that chlorination of lps caused hydrogen loss and the hydrogen was usually substituted by chlorine ozone should have different mechanism it can add oxygen to an organic compound to form a hydroxyl group jeong et al 2010 tay et al 2010 some hydroxyl groups can be further oxidized to aldehyde or keto groups and even carboxyl groups von gunten 2003 jeong et al 2010 aimi et al 2005 during the oxidative reaction the hydrogen is removed but which sites on lps are most sensitive is not very clear the best way to know that is to synthesize a simple model r form lps without o antigen for 2d nmr analysis further study is needed to accomplish this aim the above results were further confirmed by ftir spectra fig 4 ozone treatment introduced several new or more chemical groups into lps we presumed that they were hydroxyl group 3750 cm 1 aldehyde or keto group 1725 cm 1 carbon nitrogen triple bond 2118 cm 1 respectively these chemical groups implied the addition of oxygen and loss of hydrogen the saccharide ring can be oxidized to generate new hydroxyl group kishimoto 1996 oxidation can also cause dehydrogenation which is demonstrated in previous studies li et al 2016 xu et al 2017 both ozonation and chlorination can introduce electronegative atoms to the lps molecule which increases the molecular polarity this could be one of the reasons reducing the size of lps aggregates and the size of lps has been proved to be crucial to the inflammation inducing ability the cell wall bound lps and small aggregate both have lower ability to trigger the innate immune system compared with the normal lps aggregates in the solution zhang et al 2016 xue et al 2016 why cell wall bound lps is not sensitive to the immune system and what the most sensitive lps form is still unclear an aggregate size between several dozens to several hundreds of nanometers seems to be most potent immunogen form however the aggregate size is also influenced by many factors like lps concentration temperature presence of cations detergents surfactant and chelators bergstrand et al 2006 pontes et al 2012 keese et al 2014 hirayama and sakata 2002 3 2 effects of ozonation on gram negative bacteria gram negative bacterium is the major source of natural lps while gram positive cell does not contain lps one single cell of e coli bacterium may release about two million molecular of lps when fractured gorbet and sefton 2005 and about 99 of bacteria in the reclaimed water are gram negative xue et al 2016 three gram negative bacteria e coli x1 enterobacter aerogenes x4 and klebsiella pneumonia x5 from secondary effluent isolated by the previous study were used as test strains the endotoxin activities of the bacterial suspensions after two washes were all below 100 eu ml when the concentrated ozone solution was added into the suspensions the bacteria were completely inactivated rapidly within 1 min fig s2 demonstrating the enough quantity of ozone and the cell wall bound endotoxins were released in a short time which caused a dramatic increase of endotoxin activities of filtered solution fig s3 then the released free endotoxin further reacted with ozone which made the endotoxin activity continue to increase or decrease slightly the inflammation inducing abilities of the bacteria suspensions were relatively weak even though the concentration of bacteria were considerably high fig 5 when adding ozone solution into the system the pmn proportions reached the highest levels after 1 min for all three strains but the endotoxin activities were still in relatively low levels fig 5 when the endotoxin activities rose up to the top the inflammation inducing ability already fell back to the original levels these results demonstrated once again the discrepancy between lal assay and the in vivo toxicity test proposed by the previous study zhang et al 2016 the lal assay cannot tell the toxicity of lps especially after oxidative treatment and it even cannot tell the absolute quantity of lps because of the different endotoxin activities in different forms toxicity test or other functional tests are necessary when health risk is concerned in treated reclaimed water functional tests for animals have been applied in some studies such as airway responsiveness card et al 2006 central airway resistance lai et al 2012 but functional responses are not as sensitive as toxicity indexes for human lung function indexes and inflammation parameters can all be tested for evaluation of possible human inhalation risks moller et al 2012 lung function indexes usually include the first second of forced expiration fev1 to the full forced vital capacity fvc bronchial hyperresponsiveness bhr peak expiratory flow pef and inflammation parameters usually include eno exhaled nitric oxide c reactive protein crp and neutrophil counts in blood samples 3 3 effects of ozonation on reclaimed water free endotoxin and gram negative bacteria both exist in reclaimed water according to the results above ozonation on free endotoxin decreases its inflammation inducing ability while insufficient ozonation on gram negative bacteria solution increases the inflammatory response therefore in reclaimed water ozone reacts with both the free endotoxin and gram negative bacteria making the overall effects largely unknown and many organics other than endotoxin and bacteria in reclaimed water can also react with ozone which makes the results even more unpredictable therefore different ozone dosages and three reclaimed water samples from different sources table 1 were tested based on the results above the reaction of ozonation finished within 5 min thus ozonation on reclaimed water was designed for 10 min due to the limited concentration of ozone solution generated by the ozone maker the ozone dosages could not be higher than 17 5 mg l since the large volume of ozone solution would dilute the water sample too much to weaken the response after acute exposure a relatively low dosage of ozone could enhance both of the endotoxin activities and the inflammation inducing abilities of three reclaimed water fig 6 when the ozone dosage was large enough the inflammatory response decreased but still could not be lower than that of the untreated water these results were not surprising because low dosage of ozone could release lps from the living bacteria but was not enough to inactivate their inflammation inducing ability and when the ozone dosage was higher the free endotoxin could be further oxidized in a reported event lifeguards in a swimming pool felt chest tightening shortness of breath and sluggishness the possible main reason was the endotoxin in pools aerosolized and inhaled by the lifeguards due to the fan sprays and wall spouts however in another two pools the endotoxin levels were even higher but the lifeguards had no symptoms which would be an evidence of adverse health effects caused by aerosolized endotoxin inhalation after installation of an ozone treatment system the endotoxin level decreased dramatically and the symptoms of lifeguards disappeared which is critical for us to demonstrate the effects of ozonation on degrading the symptoms caused by endotoxin mcgregor et al 1993 in that case the ozone dose could be much higher with ozone bubbling treatment than the dose in this work however the three samples also showed apparent differences between each other for example the inflammation inducing ability of l was increased a lot after treatment and it could be reduced back easily fig 6b while the overall changes of p were relatively small fig 6a and r showed the highest initial potential and strong resistance to ozonation fig 6c for the untreated samples the levels of pmn was positively correlated to their original endotoxin activities which fits the finding of the previous study xue et al 2016 nevertheless the trend of pmn reduction could not be easily read from the water quality indices no single index could match the reduction pattern doc nh3 n and bacteria in the water all can consume ozone which one is the main contributor still needs further study fortunately when the bacteria inactivation of the three samples was checked it showed similar trend as the reduction of inflammation fig 7 the bacteria in sample r was most difficult to be inactivated which was consistent with the highest requirement of ozone for inflammation reduction although why sample r was so special is unknown what can be confirmed is something in the water consumed more ozone leading to both the low bacterial inactivation and inflammation reduction 4 conclusions this work reveals that ozonation can release the lps on gram negative bacteria cause the increase of endotoxin activity and simultaneously oxidize the lps leading to the reduction of aggregate size and inflammation inducing ability the ozone treatment cannot significantly remove the inflammation inducing ability in the reclaimed water and may even increase the inhalation health risk when ozone dosage is not enough which

18974,titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles nps encounter heavy metals in the environment under different scenarios however the mechanism of their joint toxicity effects on daphnia magna remains vague this study assessed the effects of hydrophobicity of tio2 nps tdonps and exposure scenarios on copper uptake and toxicity in daphnia magna in the individual exposure scenario hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps both showed no acute toxicity to daphnia magna whereas individual cu2 exposure resulted in a 30 mortality rate co exposure and sequential exposure to the two types of tdonp and cu2 resulted in mortality rates of 40 50 the mechanisms of the increased cu2 toxicity caused by hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonp were different in the presence of hydrophobic tdonps the cu toxicity could be attributed to the increased bioaccumulation of cu and ti leading to high oxidative stress injury the cu toxicity due to hydrophilic tdonps could be induced by intensified intestinal membrane damage the obtained data suggest that the hydrophobicity of the tdonps plays a critical role in regulating the toxicity of cu2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords titanium dioxide nanoparticles hydrophobicity copper acute toxicity daphnia magna 1 introduction as nanotechnologies have developed titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles nps with numerous novel and useful properties have been manufactured and used increasingly in many fields thereby placing tio2 nps tdonps under toxicity scrutiny kaegi et al 2008 gottschalk et al 2009 wiesenthal et al 2011 despite the low toxicity lethal concentrations are 5 125 mg l for aquatic organisms lovern et al 2007 xiong et al 2011 clement et al 2013 and low environmental exposure levels of tdonps themselves 3 ng l to 110 μg l in surface water gottschalk et al 2013 sun et al 2014 and 100 3000 μg l in wastewater treatment plants kiser et al 2009 they interact with other environmental contaminants such as heavy metals lu et al 2017 and such interactions modify the environmental behavior and or toxicity of the heavy metals to aquatic organisms fan et al 2011 tan et al 2012 romanello and de cortalezzi 2013 pavagadhi et al 2014 copper cu is a ubiquitous aquatic contaminant with concentrations observed to be occasionally greater than 200 μg l in surface waters süß et al 2006 recently the joint acute toxicity of tdonps and copper ions cu2 to aquatic organisms has been investigated widely fan et al 2011 2016 rosenfeldt et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2016 chen et al 2007 hua et al 2012 but the joint toxicity mechanisms remain vague on the one hand tdonps with large surface area and selective affinity e g unsaturated oxygen deprotonated surface hydroxyls can reduce the concentration of most toxic cu species i e cu2 in water column and consequently eliminate the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of cu2 from the water phase to aquatic organisms rosenfeldt et al 2015a 2015b hua et al 2012 liu et al 2015 on the other hand tdonps also act as cu2 carriers upon ingestion thereby increasing the ecotoxicity to aquatic organisms e g daphnia magna and gammarus fossarum fan et al 2011 2012 2016 rosenfeldt et al 2016 wang et al 2011 these inconclusive descriptions of the effects on aquatic organisms have indicated that the joint acute toxicity may differ in different aquatic organisms and may as well be affected by multiples factors steps unlike the unicellular organism nutrient intake via endocytosis the joint toxicity of tdonps and cu2 to daphnia magna filter feeding organism can be determined by the following processes the interactions between tdonps and cu2 the suspension feeding process i e ingestion of tio2 np and cu2 from the environment into the gut the digestion process uptake of tio2 np and cu2 from the gut into tissue and cells the size of tdonps plays a critical role in regulating the extent of joint toxicity during the above mentioned processes rosenfeldt et al 2014 2015a liu et al 2015 during the interactions process between tdonps and cu2 the smaller nps with larger specific area may adsorb more metal ions and more toxic in the subsequent daphnia magna suspension feeding process large nps may be filtered and ingested with higher uptake rates when compared with that of the original smaller particles gophen and geller 1984 however the particles ingestion rate does not necessarily determine the extent of toxicity during the digestion process after being ingested small nps are more reactive and toxic when compared with the larger ones hund rinke and simon 2006 kim et al 2010 further the surface charge of nps is another critical factor that affects the extent of joint toxicity during the interactions process between tdonps and cu2 more negatively charged nps may adsorb more amount of metal ions during the subsequent daphnia magna suspension feeding process the surface charge of the nps may also affect the ingestion rate according to the literature the adhesive characteristics of the filtering elements of the a given aquatic organism may affect the particle capture determining its resources availability further daphnia magna preferentially retains more neutral particles than negatively charged particles of the same size and density labarbera 1978 gerritsen and porter 1982 longmire et al 2008 rummel et al 2017 after ingestion the toxicity of the nps was observed to increase with an increase in surface charge huang et al 2017 in addition to the characteristics of the nps and feeding organisms the exposure conditions such as the exposure to two toxicants in sequence or co exposure may lead to different toxicity patterns ashauer et al 2017 however little is known whether pre exposure to tdonp contamination influences the physiology of daphnia magna and their uptake of cu2 previous studies showed that the toxic action of one food species for daphnia magna might reduce the ingestion of all species mcmahon and rigler 1965 nps can reduce energy acquisition by inhibiting food ingestion food assimilation efficiency or a combination of both allen et al 1995 de schamphelaere et al 2007 given that the sequence effect and carry over toxicity of tdonp are currently not thoughtfully considered in environmental risk assessment in depth research of this topic is of considerable importance in the present work we studied cu2 ions tdonps and their joint effect on the acute toxicity of a pelagic standard test organism daphnia magna in three steps i the interaction of tdonps with cu2 ii the suspension feeding process and iii the damage during digestion process in particular we have investigated the manner in which the physiochemical properties i e hydrophilic hydrophobic and different exposure scenarios i e individual exposure co exposure

every other day the health and sensitivity of the daphnia magna were verified on a monthly basis by performing acute toxicity tests with the reference toxicant potassium dichromate according to the oecd guidelines to control the medium conditions during the experiments the modified elendt sm7 medium samel et al 1999 instead of filtered jingmi water was used as the exposure medium the composition

the tdonps can be found in fig 1 the fourier transform infrared spectral results showed that the surfaces of the hydrophilic tdonp were modified with al oh 3 and the surfaces of hydrophobic tdonp were modified with al oh 3 and stearic acid which is in agreement with the details that has been provided for these two materials by the suppliers stock suspensions of tdonps 1 g l were prepared as described elsewhere lovern and klaper 2006 and was stored in darkness at room temperature before the exposure experiments stock solutions were sonicated for 30 min 50 w l at 40 khz and diluted with the elendt sm7 medium 2 3 protocol for testing acute toxicity to assess the roles of physiochemical properties and exposure scenarios in the expressed toxicity of tdonps and cu2 a 48 h bioassay was conducted using 14 day old daphnia magna from the same generation with similar sizes before the toxicity test the daphnia magna were isolated in natural water and denied green algae for 3 h to empty their guts the daphnia magna were then exposed to the contaminants in different scenarios we investigated ten exposure scenarios control sm7 as scenario i hydrophilic tio2 individual exposure hl as

scenario x the details are presented in fig s1 the concentrations of tdonps and cu2 for each scenario are set to be 1 mg l and 100 μg l respectively the tio2 concentration is environmentally relevant kiser et al 2009 and has been exhibited to trigger no sub lethal effects in previous experiments rosenfeldt et al 2015b further the cu concentration is expected to cause sub lethal effects and clear oxidative stress in accordance with our previous results fan et al 2011 2012 during the toxicity test no green algae were added to the exposure medium the daphnia magna exposure experiments were performed in 1 000 ml beakers containing 500 ml of sm7 medium contaminants and 50 daphnia magna the experimental toxicity conditions were the same as the culture condition for daphnia magna see model organism and exposure media each treatment was repeated three times 2 4 analytical methods the amount of ros generated in the daphnia magna was determined using h2dcfda reagent xie et al 2006 only live daphnia magna were used for ros determination at each time point ten daphnia magna with approximately 1 ml of exposure solution were transferred to a 48 well cluster plate the exposure solution was aspirated off leaving the daphnia magna in each well one milliliter of 10 mm h2dcfda was added immediately to each well in the cluster plate fluorescence was monitored using a cytofluor fluorometer millipore inc usa with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm both with a bandwidth of 20 nm fluorescence was measured after 4 h incubation with the dye after the fluorescence analysis the daphnia magna were transferred to whatman 3m blotting paper fisher scientific to dry for 15 min and then weighed the fluorescence was divided by the fresh weight to quantify the accumulation of cu and ti the mortality ten daphnia magna were removed and depurated in ultra pure water for approximately 2 min daphnia magna were subsequently dried at 80 c to a constant weight and then digested in 68 hno3 aristar grade at 110 c the digestion tubes were washed with 2 nitric acid and the washed solution was transferred to a volumetric flask the cu and ti concentrations in the digest were further analyzed by icp ms further the metal accumulation was calculated based on the dry weight of the daphnia magna twenty exposed daphnia magna were weighed and homogenized via ultrasonication in 0 5 ml of sucrose buffer 0 25 m sucrose 0 1 m tris hcl ph 8 6 and centrifuged at 16 000 g for 20 min the homogenates that were prepared for performing the testes were diluted to 2 5 in phosphate buffered saline for biochemical assays further mda was determined using the thiobarbituric acid reactive method the activity of na k atpase was measured by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate pi liberated from the hydrolysis of the atp substrate the mda and the activity of na k atpase were both measured using commercially available kits nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china mt was measured using the modified silver saturation method described in our previous study fan et al 2011 to investigate the adsorption kinetics of cu2 for the two types of tdonp we added cu2 into the tdonp suspension the final concentrations of cu2 and tdonps were 100 μg l and 1 mg l respectively the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 2 by adding 0 1 m naoh at zero 5 15 30 60 and 360 min 2 ml of the tdonp suspension were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 12 000 g using a versatile compact centrifuge himac cf 16rx hitachi japan to separate the tdonps the cu2 concentration in the supernatant was determined through icp ms the adsorption capacity of tdonps to cu can be calculated from the difference in cu2 concentration in the solution before and after the adsorption equilibrium the adsorption kinetics are described with the pseudo first order model eq 1 and the pseudo second order model eq 2 1 log q e q t logq e k 1 t 2 303 2 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e

rate constants respectively a first order one compartment model was used to estimate the tdonp and cu uptake and elimination kinetic parameters atkins 1969 3 c i n t c 0 k 1 k 2 c e x p 1 e k 2 t where c int μg g dry body weight is the contaminant concentration in the aquatic organisms at time t h c 0 μg g dry body weight is the basal internal contaminant concentration in the aquatic organisms

expressed as the mean values of parallel analyses a one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s hsd test was used to test for significant differences among the treatment groups the differences between the groups were significant at p 0 05 the time dependent mortality rates of different groups were compared statistically using kaplan meier survival analysis to estimate the mean and median survival time in each group and to pairwise compare the equality of overall survival distributions between different groups the statistical analyses were performed using spss statistic 22 ibm 3 results 3 1 adsorption of cu2 by tio2 nps the adsorption of cu2 by each type of tdonp increases considerably until the contact time reaches 60 min whereupon there is no further noticeable increase in adsorption fig s2 a the pseudo saturated adsorption capacities of cu2 by hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps were 78 4 and 51 5 μg mg respectively as shown in table 1 the pseudo second order model is observed to precisely describes the adsorption of cu2 by tdonps given the high correlation coefficients and q e being closer to the value that has been experimentally determined the values of the pseudo second order rate constant for hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps were 0 001125 and 0 000497 μg mg min respectively indicating that cu2 adsorption by hydrophilic tdonps is twice as fast as that by hydrophobic tdonps 3 2 toxicity and bioaccumulation of ti and cu in daphnia magna the mortalities of daphnia magna that were exposed to hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps individually were zero for the 48 h acute tests whereas for 48 h individual cu2 exposure the mortality of daphnia magna was above 30 kaplan meier survival analysis was carried out to estimate the mean mst and the median survival time of daphnia magna in different exposure scenarios table 2 notably as depicted in table 2 daphnia magna exhibited shorter mst under the co exposure of cu2 and tdonps compared with the individual exposure of cu2 moreover the estimated msts for 3 h pre exposure to two types of tdonps and 48 h sequential exposure to cu2 were both shorter than that for 48 h individual exposure to cu2 the highest mortality i e 69 5 and shortest mst of daphnia magna was observed in co exposure of hydrophilic tdonps and cu2 with 3h pre exposure of hydrophilic tdonps as shown in table 2 and fig s3 the survival distribution was assessed among different exposure scenarios using breslow statistics in kaplan meiser survival analysis there was statistically significant p 0 001 difference between cu2 and two types of tdonps co exposure and the individual cu2 exposure the difference was insignificant p 0 171 between cu2 and hydrophilic tdonps co exposure and cu2 and hydrophobic tdonps co exposure fig 2 shows how the different exposure scenarios affected the accumulation of ti and cu in daphnia magna collectively the accumulation of ti increased sharply during the first 10 h of exposure to tdonps solutions with or without cu2 addition the ti accumulation was 800 1 200 μg ti g dw after 48 h exposure for all treatments and was higher with the exposure medium containing the hydrophobic tdonps compared with the hydrophilic tdonps fig 2 a notably as evidenced in table 3 the ti uptake rate and accumulation amount with individual hydrophilic tdonp exposure treatment were lower than those with the other treatments additionally co existence of cu2 enhanced the ti uptake rate markedly but the final amount of ti accumulation did not change compared with the individual tdonp exposure treatments tdonp pre exposure did not affect the amount of ti accumulation in daphnia magna fig 2 b as shown in fig 2 c the cu accumulation in the co exposure scenarios was 70 150 higher than that with individual cu exposure as expected interestingly pre exposure to tdonps significantly reduced p 0 05 the cu accumulation in daphnia magna compared with individual cu exposure fig 2 d 3 3 changes of four toxicity parameters in daphnia magna in various exposure scenarios the concentrations of ros and mda in daphnia magna exposed to media containing hydrophobic tdonps are respectively higher than those exposed to hydrophilic tdonps co exposure induced higher ros and mda extents compared with individual exposure fig 3 a and b and s4 pre exposure 3 h to tdonps followed by 48 h of individual cu2 exposure dramatically increased the amounts of endogenous ros and mda compared with those without pre exposure fig 3 a and b and s4 fig 3 d and fig s5 illustrate the changes in mt concentration in daphnia magna in different exposure scenarios the mt transcription of daphnia magna exposed to individual cu2 was significantly higher than those of co exposure of cu2 and two types of tdonps p 0 01 the activity of na k atpase in daphnia magna exposed to the medium containing individually hydrophilic tdonps was lower than that with individually hydrophobic tdonps compared with the cu2 exposure treatment the co exposure treatments exhibited slightly lower na k atpase activity fig 4 and fig s6 pre exposure to the hydrophilic tdonp significantly decreased the na k atpase levels in daphnia magna compared with the corresponding scenarios without pre exposure fig 4 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 principal component analysis for various toxicity parameters of daphnia magna in different exposure scenarios to distinguish the contributions to toxicity by cu2 tdonps and their joint effect we performed principal component analysis pca fig 5 among the toxicity parameters of daphnia magna and the exposure scenarios we segmented ten exposure scenarios into three categories i 48 h individual tdonp exposure ii 48 h individual cu2 exposure with or without 3 h tdonp pre exposure and iii 48 h cu2 and tdonp co exposure with or without 3 h tdonp pre exposure the influences of cu2 and tdonps on various toxicity parameters i e ti accumulation cu accumulation endogenous ros mt mda na k atpase and mortality mr of daphnia magna were studied for these three categories in first exposure category the results showed that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps have different effects on the toxicity parameters of daphnia magna fig 5 a the pc1 values for samples exposed to hydrophobic tdonps hydrophilic tdonps and the control are positive near zero and negative respectively fig 5 b shows the pca for the second exposure category the pc1 dataset is driven strongly by atp and mortality rate the sample dots in fig 5 b can be classified into two groups those dots with tdonp pre exposure are far from those without pre exposure and the short period of tdonp pre exposure i e 3 h would also increase the endogenous ros generation in daphnia magna the pca for the third exposure category shows that the vectors of ros cu bioaccumulation ti bioaccumulation mda and mt are significantly p 0 05 and positively correlated with each other as shown in fig 5 c pc2 separates individual cu2 with 3 h hydrophilic tdonps pre exposure negative scores and co exposure of cu2 and hydrophilic tdonps scores close to zero from cu2 with 3 h hydrophobic tdonps pre exposure and co exposure of cu2 and hydrophobic tdonps positive scores also the significantly positive correlation between cu bioaccumulation and ti bioaccumulation shows that cu2 was mainly taken up together with the tdonps fig 5 and table s2 based on the pca results we can conclude that both the hydrophobicity and the exposure scenarios are dominant factors that determine the toxicity of tdonps and cu2 4 2 influence of hydrophobicity of tio2 nps on ingestion of cu2 and tio2 nps the daphnia magna body is enclosed by the carapace nps adhere to the carapace surface and are lost during molts botha et al 2016 previous studies demonstrated that a number of different types of np accumulate in the gut but are not easily transported across the carapace and gut wall tan et al 2012 botha et al 2016 mansfield et al 2015 liu et al 2018 additionally cu accumulates in the bodies of daphnia magna mostly through diet gillis et al 2005 zhao et al 2009 therefore bioaccumulation of cu and ti in daphnia magna is mostly via the uptake of food i e diet borne and water i e water borne in the individual cu2 exposure scenario daphnia magna ingested cu2 mainly from the aqueous phase the present experimental results show that pre exposure to the two types of tdonp for 3 h can significantly reduce cu bioaccumulation compared with the non pre exposure scenarios fig 2 b and table 3 therefore we conclude that the existence of tdonps in vivo dramatically reduces the filter feeding activity of daphnia magna and thus reduces cu ingestion this loss of appetite due to tdonps is also found in mouse experiments chen et al 2009 dang et al 2000 in the co exposure scenario cu is ingested from two main sources namely the cu ions in the aquatic medium and the cu absorbed by the tdonps compared with the hydrophobic tdonps the hydrophilic ones exhibit a much higher adsorption rate and larger adsorption capacity for cu ions which is attributed to the large number of hydroxyl groups on the tio2 surface table 1 and fig 1 yang and davis 1999 however the cu bioaccumulation in daphnia magna exposed to hydrophobic tdonps is significantly p 0 05 higher than that in those exposed to hydrophilic ones because most cu is ingested via food in the form of the cu tdonp complex we hypothesize that the differing cu accumulation with the type of tdonp is due to the corresponding differing ingestion rate the ingestion of engineered nps by aquatic animals is restricted mainly to adsorption normal feeding and or water filtration through the gills bruinink et al 2015 mechanical sieving is the dominant factor in filter feeding in daphnia magna food particles smaller than the filter mesh size 0 5 μm are not retained but larger ones are filtered and ingested with high uptake rates gophen and geller 1984 for particles smaller than the filter mesh size gerritsen and porter 1982 argued adamantly that the electrostatic interaction between the particles and the filter surface dictated the ingestion rate they showed that neutral particles were captured more readily than were particles with a net negative charge and that the higher wettability caused more particles to escape the daphnia magna filtering apparatus gerritsen and porter 1982 in our study the hydrophobic tdonps caused a much higher ingestion rate compared with the hydrophilic ones fig 2 a and table 3 we conclude that size and surface chemical properties are the two main factors affecting the uptake rate of tdonps the hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps with primary particle sizes of 10 30 nm agglomerate to sizes of approximately 300 nm and 500 nm respectively in bulk water fig 1 the hydrophobic tdonps exhibit much smaller wettability and surface charges compared with the hydrophilic tdonps the larger size of aggregated hydrophobic tdonps and their chemical properties led to the higher uptake rate fig 2 a and table 3 the cu adsorption behavior of tdonps also changes the electrical potential on the tdonp surfaces the coexistence of cu potentially influences the hydrodynamic diameters of the tdonps and consequently causes the further aggregation and faster uptake rate fig 2 d and table 3 the hypothesis of further aggregation of the cu tdonp complex within the gills is supported by the sem results showing that the sizes of the aggregated cu tdonp complex exceed 1 μm fig s7 the same observation was made by tervonen et al 2010 who reported that nc60 agglomerates in the guts of organisms were larger and more angular than those suspended in water therefore we conclude that the larger hydrodynamic diameter and lower wettability and surface charge cause the higher uptake rate of the hydrophobic tdonps 4 3 comparison of damage mechanism caused by the two types of tio2 np after ingestion apart from the 3 h pre exposure to tdonps followed by 48 h joint exposure to cu2 and tdonps the mortalities of daphnia magna exposed to hydrophobic tdonps were similar to those exposed to hydrophilic tdonps under the same exposure conditions table 2 and fig s3 however the pca results denote that the mechanisms of the joint toxicity of the two types of tdonp with cu2 are different fig 5 the cu bioaccumulation ti bioaccumulation endogenous ros generation and mda values for the samples that were exposed to the hydrophobic tdonps were significantly higher than those for the samples exposed to the hydrophilic tdonps however the na k atpase activities for the samples exposed to the hydrophilic tdonps were lower than those for the samples exposed to the hydrophobic tdonps na k atpase has been denoted to be a highly conserved membrane enzyme that is essential for conducting ion homeostasis at the cellular and organism levels which has been used as a biomarker for detecting the damage to the intestines of daphnia magna dang et al 2000 morth et al 2011 thus the oxidative stress and the damage of gut membrane are two main factors that can be observed in the toxicity mechanism of the co exposure of two types of tdonp with cu2 in the absence of cu2 the two types of tdonp both induce ros formation by surface catalyzing chemical reactions lu et al 2017 li et al 2015 compared with the hydrophilic tdonps the ros formation by hydrophobic tdonps was significantly higher fig 3 a with the co existence of cu2 the ros amount increased significantly indicating that co exposure scenarios induce higher levels of ros compared with the individual exposure scenarios fig 3 a to eliminate the effect of higher hydrophobic tdonp vitro ingestion we calculated the toxicity parameters with pre unit ingested tdonps fig 6 e j the results show that the ros and mda amounts with pre unit ingested hydrophobic tdonps are still significantly higher than those with the hydrophilic tdonps p 0 05 while the amount of cu2 with pre unit ingested tdonps is similar fig 6 e and f apart from the photo generated ros by tdonps and the fenton type reaction induced by ingested cu2 the reduced antioxidative enzymes such as mt also conversely allow ros formation according to our results the adsorption of cu ions by the two types of tdonp was represented most appropriately by a pseudo second order rate process based on the chemical adsorption ho et al 2002 the tdonps were combined with cu2 via the formation of ocu bonds yang and davis 1999 barakat 2005 therefore displacing cu combined with tdonps using a thiol group makes it difficult to form mt this is consistent with previous results fan et al 2011 showing that the induction of mt content in daphnia magna caused by cu2 dropped significantly fig 3 e because of the existence of tdonps compared with hydrophilic tdonps the amount of mt with pre unit ingested hydrophobic tdonps was significantly lower fig 6 g p 0 05 therefore we conclude that the hydrophobic tdonps induce stronger oxidative stress than do the hydrophilic tdonps nps may cause focal dissolution of the plasma membrane and hole formation which is another important reason for their cytotoxicity nel et al 2009 it is accepted that positively charged nps are more cytotoxic in cells than are negatively charged variants of similar size frohlich 2012 hydrophobicity is often linked to surface charge in our study the zeta potential of the hydrophobic tdonps was much lower than that of the hydrophilic tdonps with the co existence of cu2 the absolute values of the zeta potential for both types of tdonp decreased compared with the hydrophobic tdonps the hydrophilic tdonps offered far more binding sites for cu ions thus the co existence of cu with hydrophilic tdonps significantly p 0 01 increased the mortality of daphnia magna compared with the individual exposure conditions table 2 and fig s3 the level of damage done to the intestines of daphnia magna is normally detected by inspecting them with sem or tem which makes quantitative determination difficult conversely na k atpase has been shown to be a highly conserved membrane enzyme essential for ion homeostasis at the cellular and organism levels dang et al 2000 morth et al 2011 sem images fig 6 show that the guts of daphnia magna exposed to cu2 in the presence of hydrophilic tdonps were damaged more severely than were those of daphnia magna exposed to cu2 in the presence of hydrophobic tdonps fig 6 b and d meanwhile the na k atpase activities with per unit hydrophobic tdonps were also significantly higher than those with hydrophilic tdonps fig 6 j the cationic charge density of the hydrophilic tdonps enhanced hole formation greatly leading to the higher mortality of daphnia magna 5 conclusions in summary this study assessed the acute toxicity of cu2 in combination with different hydrophobicity properties of tio2 nps tdonps and exposure scenarios involving daphnia magna the increased toxicities of cu2 due to hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps were different the toxicity obtained from the co exposure of hydrophobic tdonps with cu2 could be attributed to the increased bioaccumulation of cu and ti leading to high oxidative stress injury in contrast the toxicity from the co exposure of hydrophilic tdonps with cu2 could be induced by the intensified intestinal membrane damage the obtained data suggest that the hydrophobicity of tdonps plays a critical role in regulating the toxicity of cu2 this study has shed new light on the understanding of

18974,titanium dioxide tio2 nanoparticles nps encounter heavy metals in the environment under different scenarios however the mechanism of their joint toxicity effects on daphnia magna remains vague this study assessed the effects of hydrophobicity of tio2 nps tdonps and exposure scenarios on copper uptake and toxicity in daphnia magna in the individual exposure scenario hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps both showed no acute toxicity to daphnia magna whereas individual cu2 exposure resulted in a 30 mortality rate co exposure and sequential exposure to the two types of tdonp and cu2 resulted in mortality rates of 40 50 the mechanisms of the increased cu2 toxicity caused by hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonp were different in the presence of hydrophobic tdonps the cu toxicity could be attributed to the increased bioaccumulation of cu and ti leading to high oxidative stress injury the cu toxicity due to hydrophilic tdonps could be induced by intensified intestinal membrane damage the obtained data suggest that the hydrophobicity of the tdonps plays a critical role in regulating the toxicity of cu2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords titanium dioxide nanoparticles

concentrations are 5 125 mg l for aquatic organisms lovern et al 2007 xiong et al 2011 clement et al 2013 and low environmental exposure levels of tdonps themselves 3 ng l to 110 μg l in surface water

interactions modify the environmental behavior and or toxicity of the heavy metals to aquatic organisms fan et al 2011 tan et al 2012 romanello and de cortalezzi 2013 pavagadhi et al 2014 copper cu is a ubiquitous aquatic contaminant with concentrations observed to be occasionally greater than 200 μg l in surface waters süß et al 2006 recently the joint acute toxicity of tdonps and copper ions cu2 to aquatic organisms has been investigated widely fan et al 2011 2016 rosenfeldt et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2016 chen et al 2007 hua et al 2012 but the joint toxicity mechanisms remain vague on the one hand tdonps with large surface area and selective affinity e g unsaturated oxygen deprotonated surface hydroxyls can reduce the concentration of most toxic cu species i e cu2 in water column and consequently eliminate the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of cu2 from the water phase to aquatic organisms rosenfeldt et al 2015a 2015b hua et al 2012 liu et al 2015 on the other hand tdonps also act as cu2 carriers upon ingestion thereby increasing the ecotoxicity to aquatic organisms e g daphnia magna and gammarus fossarum fan et al 2011 2012 2016 rosenfeldt et al 2016 wang et al 2011 these inconclusive descriptions of the effects on aquatic organisms have indicated that the joint acute toxicity may differ in different aquatic organisms and may as well be affected by multiples factors steps unlike the unicellular organism nutrient intake via endocytosis the joint toxicity of tdonps and cu2 to daphnia magna filter feeding organism can be determined by the following processes the interactions between tdonps and cu2 the suspension feeding process i e ingestion of tio2 np and cu2 from the environment into the gut the digestion process uptake of tio2 np and cu2 from the gut into tissue and cells the size of tdonps plays a critical role in regulating the extent of joint toxicity during the above mentioned processes rosenfeldt et al 2014 2015a liu et al 2015 during the interactions process between tdonps and cu2 the smaller nps with larger specific area may adsorb more metal ions and more toxic in the subsequent daphnia magna suspension feeding process large nps may be filtered and ingested with higher uptake rates when compared with that of the original smaller particles gophen and geller 1984 however the particles ingestion rate does not necessarily determine the extent of toxicity during the digestion process after being ingested small nps are more reactive and toxic when compared with the larger ones hund rinke and simon 2006 kim et al 2010 further the surface charge of nps is another critical factor that affects the extent of joint toxicity during the interactions process between tdonps and cu2 more negatively charged nps may adsorb more amount of metal ions during the subsequent daphnia magna suspension feeding process the surface charge of the nps may also affect the ingestion rate according to the literature the adhesive characteristics of the filtering elements of the a given aquatic organism may affect the particle capture determining its resources availability further daphnia magna preferentially retains more neutral particles than negatively charged particles of the same size and density labarbera 1978 gerritsen and porter 1982 longmire et al 2008 rummel et al 2017 after ingestion the toxicity of the nps was observed to increase with an increase in surface charge huang et al 2017 in addition to the characteristics of the nps and feeding organisms the exposure conditions such as the exposure to two toxicants in sequence or co exposure may lead to different toxicity patterns ashauer et al 2017 however little is known whether pre exposure to tdonp contamination influences the physiology of daphnia magna and their uptake of cu2 previous studies showed that the toxic action of one food species for daphnia magna might reduce the ingestion of all species mcmahon and rigler 1965 nps can reduce energy acquisition by inhibiting food ingestion food assimilation efficiency or a combination of both allen et al 1995 de schamphelaere et al 2007 given that the sequence effect and carry over toxicity of tdonp are currently not thoughtfully considered in environmental risk assessment in depth research of this topic is of considerable importance in the present work we studied cu2 ions tdonps and their joint effect on the acute toxicity of a pelagic standard test organism daphnia magna in three steps i the interaction of tdonps with cu2 ii the suspension feeding process and iii the damage during digestion process in particular we have investigated the manner in which the physiochemical properties i e hydrophilic hydrophobic and different exposure scenarios i e individual exposure co exposure

light dark cycle of 16 8 h with a light intensity of 7 000 μmol photons m 2 s 1 40 w fsl china the growth medium for the daphnia magna was filtered water through a 1 2 μm membrane from the jingmi canal china the ph total organic carbon toc and cu concentration of the growth medium were measured through a ph meter phsj 3f shanghai cany precision instrument a multi n c 2100 toc analyzer analytic jena ag and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms instrument vg plasmaquad pq2 turbo thermo elemental winsford cheshire uk further the ph toc and cu concentration values were 8 5 5 2 mg l and 3 5 μg l respectively during cultivation the daphnia magna were fed with green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii at a concentration of 1 2 10 5 cells ml d and the growth medium was renewed every other day the health and sensitivity of the daphnia magna were verified on a monthly basis by performing acute toxicity tests with the reference toxicant potassium dichromate according to the oecd guidelines to control the medium conditions during the experiments the modified elendt sm7 medium samel et al 1999 instead of filtered jingmi water was used as the exposure medium the composition of the modified elendt sm7 medium was described in our previous study fan et al 2011 2 2 preparation of tio2 suspensions we used two types of tdonp i e hydrophilic and hydrophobic that are used frequently in cosmetics and sunscreen both types were purchased from ishihara sangyo kaisha ltd in japan the average diameters surface areas and zeta potentials of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps were 29 5 sd 2 2 and 36 7 nm sd 5 2 47 5 sd 2 6 and 38 5 m2 g sd 1 5 and 28 sd 4 2 and 6 mv sd 2 1 respectively the morphology wettability and fourier transform infrared spectral properties of the tdonps can be found in fig 1 the fourier transform infrared spectral results showed that the surfaces of the hydrophilic tdonp were modified with al oh 3 and the surfaces of hydrophobic tdonp were modified with al oh 3 and stearic acid which is in agreement with the details that has been provided for these two materials by the suppliers stock suspensions of tdonps 1 g l were prepared as described elsewhere lovern and klaper 2006 and was stored in darkness at room temperature before the exposure experiments stock solutions were sonicated for 30 min 50 w l at 40 khz and diluted with the elendt sm7 medium 2 3 protocol for testing acute toxicity to assess the roles of physiochemical properties and exposure scenarios in the expressed toxicity of tdonps and cu2 a 48 h bioassay was conducted using 14 day old daphnia magna from the same generation with similar sizes before the toxicity test the daphnia magna were isolated in natural water and denied green algae for 3 h to empty

scenario x the details are presented in fig s1 the concentrations of tdonps and cu2 for each scenario are set to be 1 mg l and 100 μg l respectively the tio2 concentration is environmentally relevant kiser et al 2009 and has been exhibited to trigger no sub lethal effects in previous experiments rosenfeldt et al 2015b further the cu concentration is expected to cause sub lethal effects and clear oxidative stress in accordance with our previous results fan et al 2011 2012 during the toxicity test no green algae were added to the exposure medium the daphnia magna exposure experiments were performed in 1 000 ml beakers containing 500 ml of sm7 medium contaminants and 50 daphnia magna the experimental toxicity conditions were the same as the culture condition for daphnia magna see model organism and exposure media each treatment was repeated three times 2 4 analytical methods the amount of ros generated in the daphnia magna was determined using h2dcfda reagent xie et al 2006 only live daphnia magna were used for ros determination at each time point ten daphnia magna with approximately 1 ml of exposure solution were transferred to a 48 well cluster plate the exposure solution was aspirated off leaving the daphnia magna in each well one milliliter of 10 mm h2dcfda was added immediately to each well in the cluster plate fluorescence was monitored using a cytofluor fluorometer millipore inc usa with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm both with a bandwidth of 20 nm fluorescence was measured after 4 h incubation with the dye after the fluorescence analysis the daphnia magna were transferred to whatman 3m blotting paper fisher scientific to dry for 15 min and then weighed the fluorescence was divided by the fresh weight to quantify the accumulation of cu and ti the mortality ten daphnia magna were removed and depurated in ultra pure water for approximately 2 min daphnia magna were subsequently dried at 80 c to a constant weight and then digested in 68 hno3 aristar grade at 110 c the digestion tubes were washed with 2 nitric acid and the washed solution was transferred to a volumetric flask the cu and ti concentrations in the digest were further analyzed by icp ms further the metal accumulation was calculated based on the dry weight of the daphnia magna twenty exposed daphnia magna were weighed and homogenized via ultrasonication in 0 5 ml of sucrose buffer 0 25 m sucrose 0 1 m tris hcl ph 8 6 and centrifuged at 16 000 g for 20 min the homogenates that were prepared for performing the testes were diluted to 2 5 in phosphate buffered saline for biochemical assays further mda was determined using the thiobarbituric acid reactive method the activity of na k atpase was measured by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate pi liberated from the hydrolysis of the atp substrate the mda and the activity of na k atpase were both measured using commercially available kits nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china mt was measured using the modified silver saturation method described in our previous study fan et al 2011 to investigate the adsorption kinetics of cu2 for the two types of tdonp we added cu2 into the tdonp suspension the final concentrations of cu2 and tdonps were 100 μg l and 1 mg l respectively the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 2 by adding 0 1 m naoh at zero 5 15 30 60 and 360 min 2 ml of the tdonp suspension were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 12 000 g using a versatile compact centrifuge himac cf 16rx hitachi japan to separate the tdonps the cu2 concentration in the supernatant was determined through icp ms the adsorption capacity of tdonps to cu can be calculated from the difference in cu2 concentration in the solution before and after the adsorption equilibrium the adsorption kinetics are described with the pseudo first order model eq 1 and the pseudo second order model eq 2 1 log q e q t logq e k 1 t 2 303 2 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e

rate constants respectively a first order one compartment model was used to estimate the tdonp and cu uptake and elimination kinetic parameters atkins 1969 3 c i n t c 0 k 1 k 2 c e x p 1 e k 2 t where c int μg g dry body weight is the contaminant concentration in the aquatic organisms at time t h c 0 μg g dry body weight is the basal internal contaminant concentration in the aquatic organisms

expressed as the mean values of parallel analyses a one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s hsd test was used to test for significant differences among the treatment groups the differences between the groups were significant at p 0 05 the time dependent mortality rates of different groups were compared statistically using kaplan meier survival analysis to estimate the mean and median survival time in each group and to pairwise compare the equality of overall survival distributions between different groups the statistical analyses were performed using spss statistic 22 ibm 3 results 3 1 adsorption of cu2 by tio2 nps the adsorption of cu2 by each type of tdonp increases considerably until the contact time reaches 60 min whereupon there is no further noticeable increase in adsorption fig s2 a the pseudo saturated adsorption capacities of cu2 by hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps were 78 4 and 51 5 μg mg respectively as shown in table 1 the pseudo second order model is observed to precisely describes the adsorption of cu2 by tdonps given the high correlation coefficients and q e being closer to the value that has been experimentally determined the values of the pseudo second order rate constant for hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps were 0 001125 and 0 000497 μg mg min respectively indicating that cu2 adsorption by hydrophilic tdonps is twice as fast as that by hydrophobic tdonps 3 2 toxicity and bioaccumulation of ti and cu in daphnia magna the mortalities of daphnia magna that were exposed to hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps individually were zero for the 48 h acute tests whereas for 48 h individual cu2 exposure the mortality of daphnia magna was above 30 kaplan meier survival analysis was carried out to estimate the mean mst and the median survival time of daphnia magna in different exposure scenarios table 2 notably as depicted in table 2 daphnia magna exhibited shorter mst under the co exposure of cu2 and tdonps compared with the individual exposure of cu2 moreover the estimated msts for 3 h pre exposure to two types of tdonps and 48 h sequential exposure to cu2 were both shorter than that for 48 h individual exposure to cu2 the highest mortality i e 69 5 and shortest mst of daphnia magna was observed in co exposure of hydrophilic tdonps and cu2 with 3h pre exposure of hydrophilic tdonps as shown in table 2 and fig s3 the survival distribution was assessed among different exposure scenarios using breslow statistics in kaplan meiser survival analysis there was statistically significant p 0 001 difference between cu2 and two types of tdonps co exposure and the individual cu2 exposure the difference was insignificant p 0 171 between cu2 and hydrophilic tdonps co exposure and cu2 and hydrophobic tdonps co exposure fig 2 shows how the different exposure scenarios affected the accumulation of ti and cu in daphnia magna collectively the accumulation of ti increased sharply during the first 10 h of exposure to tdonps solutions with or without cu2 addition the ti accumulation was 800 1 200 μg ti g dw after 48 h exposure for all treatments and was higher with the exposure medium containing the hydrophobic tdonps compared with the hydrophilic tdonps fig 2 a notably as evidenced in table 3 the ti uptake rate and accumulation amount with individual hydrophilic tdonp exposure treatment were lower than those with the other treatments additionally co existence of cu2 enhanced the ti uptake rate markedly but the final amount of ti accumulation did not change compared with the individual tdonp exposure treatments tdonp pre exposure did not affect the amount of ti accumulation in daphnia magna fig 2 b as shown in fig 2 c the cu accumulation in the co exposure scenarios was 70 150 higher than that with individual cu exposure as expected interestingly pre exposure to tdonps significantly reduced p 0 05 the cu accumulation in daphnia magna compared with individual cu exposure fig 2 d 3 3 changes of four toxicity parameters in daphnia magna in various exposure scenarios the concentrations of ros and mda in daphnia magna exposed to media containing hydrophobic tdonps are respectively higher than those exposed to hydrophilic tdonps co exposure induced higher ros and mda extents compared with individual exposure fig 3 a and b and s4 pre exposure 3 h to tdonps followed by 48 h of individual cu2 exposure dramatically increased the amounts of endogenous ros and mda compared with those without pre exposure fig 3 a and b and s4 fig 3 d and fig s5 illustrate the changes in mt concentration in daphnia magna in different exposure scenarios the mt transcription of daphnia magna exposed to individual cu2 was significantly higher than those of co exposure of cu2 and two types of tdonps p 0 01 the activity of na k atpase in daphnia magna exposed to the medium containing individually hydrophilic tdonps was lower than that with individually hydrophobic tdonps compared with the cu2 exposure treatment the co exposure treatments exhibited slightly lower na k atpase activity fig 4 and fig s6 pre exposure to the hydrophilic tdonp significantly decreased the na k atpase levels in daphnia magna compared with the corresponding scenarios without pre exposure fig 4 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 principal component analysis for various toxicity parameters of daphnia magna in different exposure scenarios to distinguish the contributions to toxicity by cu2 tdonps and their joint effect we performed principal component analysis pca fig 5 among the toxicity parameters of daphnia magna and the exposure scenarios we segmented ten exposure scenarios into three categories i 48 h individual tdonp exposure ii 48 h individual cu2 exposure with or without 3 h tdonp pre exposure and iii 48 h cu2 and tdonp co exposure with or without 3 h tdonp pre exposure the influences of cu2 and tdonps on various toxicity parameters i e ti accumulation cu accumulation endogenous ros mt mda na k atpase and mortality mr of daphnia magna were studied for these three categories in first exposure category the results showed that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps have different effects on the toxicity parameters of daphnia magna fig 5 a the pc1 values for samples exposed to hydrophobic tdonps hydrophilic tdonps and the control are positive near zero and negative respectively fig 5 b shows the pca for the second exposure category the pc1 dataset is driven strongly by atp and mortality rate the sample dots in fig 5 b can be classified into two groups those dots with tdonp pre exposure are far from those without pre exposure and the short period of tdonp pre exposure i e 3 h would also increase the endogenous ros generation in daphnia magna the pca for the third exposure category shows that the vectors of ros cu bioaccumulation ti bioaccumulation mda and mt are significantly p 0 05 and positively correlated with each other as shown in fig 5 c pc2 separates individual cu2 with 3 h hydrophilic tdonps pre exposure negative scores and co exposure of cu2 and hydrophilic tdonps scores close to zero from cu2 with 3 h hydrophobic tdonps pre exposure and co exposure of cu2 and hydrophobic tdonps positive scores also the significantly positive correlation between cu bioaccumulation and ti bioaccumulation shows that cu2 was mainly taken up together with the tdonps fig 5 and table s2 based on the pca results we can conclude that both the hydrophobicity and the exposure scenarios are dominant factors that determine the toxicity of tdonps and cu2 4 2 influence of hydrophobicity of tio2 nps on ingestion of cu2 and tio2 nps the daphnia magna body is enclosed by the carapace nps adhere to the carapace surface and are lost during molts botha et al 2016 previous studies demonstrated that a number of different types of np accumulate in the gut but are not easily transported across the carapace and gut wall tan et al 2012 botha et al 2016 mansfield et al 2015 liu et al 2018 additionally cu accumulates in the bodies of daphnia magna mostly through diet gillis et al 2005 zhao et al 2009 therefore bioaccumulation of cu and ti in daphnia magna is mostly via the uptake of food i e diet borne and water i e water borne in the individual cu2 exposure scenario daphnia magna ingested cu2 mainly from the aqueous phase the present experimental results show that pre exposure to the two types of tdonp for 3 h can significantly reduce cu bioaccumulation compared with the non pre exposure scenarios fig 2 b and table 3 therefore we conclude that the existence of tdonps in vivo dramatically reduces the filter feeding activity of daphnia magna and thus reduces cu ingestion this loss of appetite due to tdonps is also found in mouse experiments chen et al 2009 dang et al 2000 in the co exposure scenario cu is ingested from two main sources namely the cu ions in the aquatic medium and the cu absorbed by the tdonps compared with the hydrophobic tdonps the hydrophilic ones exhibit a much higher adsorption rate and larger adsorption capacity for cu ions which is attributed to the large number of hydroxyl groups on the tio2 surface table 1 and fig 1 yang and davis 1999 however the cu bioaccumulation in daphnia magna exposed to hydrophobic tdonps is significantly p 0 05 higher than that in those exposed to hydrophilic ones because most cu is ingested via food in the form of the cu tdonp complex we hypothesize that the differing cu accumulation with the type of tdonp is due to the corresponding differing ingestion rate the ingestion of engineered nps by aquatic animals is restricted mainly to adsorption normal feeding and or water filtration through the gills bruinink et al 2015 mechanical sieving is the dominant factor in filter feeding in daphnia magna food particles smaller than the filter mesh size 0 5 μm are not retained but larger ones are filtered and ingested with high uptake rates gophen and geller 1984 for particles smaller than the filter mesh size gerritsen and porter 1982 argued adamantly that the electrostatic interaction between the particles and the filter surface dictated the ingestion rate they showed that neutral particles were captured more readily than were particles with a net negative charge and that the higher wettability caused more particles to escape the daphnia magna filtering apparatus gerritsen and porter 1982 in our study the hydrophobic tdonps caused a much higher ingestion rate compared with the hydrophilic ones fig 2 a and table 3 we conclude that size and surface chemical properties are the two main factors affecting the uptake rate of tdonps the hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps with primary particle sizes of 10 30 nm agglomerate to sizes of approximately 300 nm and 500 nm respectively in bulk water fig 1 the hydrophobic tdonps exhibit much smaller wettability and surface charges compared with the hydrophilic tdonps the larger size of aggregated hydrophobic tdonps and their chemical properties led to the higher uptake rate fig 2 a and table 3 the cu adsorption behavior of tdonps also changes the electrical potential on the tdonp surfaces the coexistence of cu potentially influences the hydrodynamic diameters of the tdonps and consequently causes the further aggregation and faster uptake rate fig 2 d and table 3 the hypothesis of further aggregation of the cu tdonp complex within the gills is supported by the sem results showing that the sizes of the aggregated cu tdonp complex exceed 1 μm fig s7 the same observation was made by tervonen et al 2010 who reported that nc60 agglomerates in the guts of organisms were larger and more angular than those suspended in water therefore we conclude that the larger hydrodynamic diameter and lower wettability and surface charge cause the higher uptake rate of the hydrophobic tdonps 4 3 comparison of damage mechanism caused by the two types of tio2 np after ingestion apart from the 3 h pre exposure to tdonps followed by 48 h joint exposure to cu2 and tdonps the mortalities of daphnia magna exposed to hydrophobic tdonps were similar to those exposed to hydrophilic tdonps under the same exposure conditions table 2 and fig s3 however the pca results denote that the mechanisms of the joint toxicity of the two types of tdonp with cu2 are different fig 5 the cu bioaccumulation ti bioaccumulation endogenous ros generation and mda values for the samples that were exposed to the hydrophobic tdonps were significantly higher than those for the samples exposed to the hydrophilic tdonps however the na k atpase activities for the samples exposed to the hydrophilic tdonps were lower than those for the samples exposed to the hydrophobic tdonps na k atpase has been denoted to be a highly conserved membrane enzyme that is essential for conducting ion homeostasis at the cellular and organism levels which has been used as a biomarker for detecting the damage to the intestines of daphnia magna dang et al 2000 morth et al 2011 thus the oxidative stress and the damage of gut membrane are two main factors that can be observed in the toxicity mechanism of the co exposure of two types of tdonp with cu2 in the absence of cu2 the two types of tdonp both induce ros formation by surface catalyzing chemical reactions lu et al 2017 li et al 2015 compared with the hydrophilic tdonps the ros formation by hydrophobic tdonps was significantly higher fig 3 a with the co existence of cu2 the ros amount increased significantly indicating that co exposure scenarios induce higher levels of ros compared with the individual exposure scenarios fig 3 a to eliminate the effect of higher hydrophobic tdonp vitro ingestion we calculated the toxicity parameters with pre unit ingested tdonps fig 6 e j the results show that the ros and mda amounts with pre unit ingested hydrophobic tdonps are still significantly higher than those with the hydrophilic tdonps p 0 05 while the amount of cu2 with pre unit ingested tdonps is similar fig 6 e and f apart from the photo generated ros by tdonps and the fenton type reaction induced by ingested cu2 the reduced antioxidative enzymes such as mt also conversely allow ros formation according to our results the adsorption of cu ions by the two types of tdonp was represented most appropriately by a pseudo second order rate process based on the chemical adsorption ho et al 2002 the tdonps were combined with cu2 via the formation of ocu bonds yang and davis 1999 barakat 2005 therefore displacing cu combined with tdonps using a thiol group makes it difficult to form mt this is consistent with previous results fan et al 2011 showing that the induction of mt content in daphnia magna caused by cu2 dropped significantly fig 3 e because of the existence of tdonps compared with hydrophilic tdonps the amount of mt with pre unit ingested hydrophobic tdonps was significantly lower fig 6 g p 0 05 therefore we conclude that the hydrophobic tdonps induce stronger oxidative stress than do the hydrophilic tdonps nps may cause focal dissolution of the plasma membrane and hole formation which is another important reason for their cytotoxicity nel et al 2009 it is accepted that positively charged nps are more cytotoxic in cells than are negatively charged variants of similar size frohlich 2012 hydrophobicity is often linked to surface charge in our study the zeta potential of the hydrophobic tdonps was much lower than that of the hydrophilic tdonps with the co existence of cu2 the absolute values of the zeta potential for both types of tdonp decreased compared with the hydrophobic tdonps the hydrophilic tdonps offered far more binding sites for cu ions thus the co existence of cu with hydrophilic tdonps significantly p 0 01 increased the mortality of daphnia magna compared with the individual exposure conditions table 2 and fig s3 the level of damage done to the intestines of daphnia magna is normally detected by inspecting them with sem or tem which makes quantitative determination difficult conversely na k atpase has been shown to be a highly conserved membrane enzyme essential for ion homeostasis at the cellular and organism levels dang et al 2000 morth et al 2011 sem images fig 6 show that the guts of daphnia magna exposed to cu2 in the presence of hydrophilic tdonps were damaged more severely than were those of daphnia magna exposed to cu2 in the presence of hydrophobic tdonps fig 6 b and d meanwhile the na k atpase activities with per unit hydrophobic tdonps were also significantly higher than those with hydrophilic tdonps fig 6 j the cationic charge density of the hydrophilic tdonps enhanced hole formation greatly leading to the higher mortality of daphnia magna 5 conclusions in summary this study assessed the acute toxicity of cu2 in combination with different hydrophobicity properties of tio2 nps tdonps and exposure scenarios involving daphnia magna the increased toxicities of cu2 due to hydrophilic and hydrophobic tdonps were different the toxicity obtained from the co exposure of hydrophobic tdonps with cu2 could be attributed to the increased bioaccumulation of cu and ti leading to high oxidative stress injury in contrast the toxicity from the co exposure of hydrophilic tdonps with cu2 could be induced by the intensified intestinal membrane damage the obtained data suggest that the hydrophobicity of tdonps plays a critical role in regulating the toxicity of cu2 this study has shed new light on the understanding of
