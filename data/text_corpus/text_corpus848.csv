4240,estimation of particle concentration distribution profile is important to understand the inherent mixing process changes of river morphology and nature of transportation of particles in this study the effects of non locality are investigated to analyze distinguish and predict different types of profiles of the suspended concentration distribution in turbulent flows through open channels pipes and mixing boxes the effects of non locality are captured through fractional derivatives and integrals starting from the fractional liouville equation and considering the power law jumps of particles in the carrier fluid the fractional kinetic equation is derived through mathematical analysis the kinetic model is solved and an analytical model is proposed using the laplace transformation the proposed solution contains the two parameters as α the order of fractional model and μ the shape parameter mittag leffler function and is a more general one that contains several previous models as special cases the proposed model can predict four different types of suspension concentration distributions namely type i type ii plume like and convex type profiles under different conditions further the model is validated with existing experimental data of dilute and dense flow in open channels and pipes flows in square pipes slurry pipelines and fluid mud gravity currents satisfactory results are obtained a detailed non linear multivariate regression analysis is carried out with a wide range of selected data and models are proposed to compute model parmeters to increase the efficiency of the model an artificial neural network ann model is proposed to predict the model parameters the ann based models show better results than the regression analysis validation results show that non locality has significant effects on the structure of the concentration profiles from the analysis of the model parameters it is found that type i profile occurs under the subdiffusion process where α 1 and μ 1 and other three types type ii plume like and convex of profiles are associated with the superdiffusion process when α 1 and μ 1 keywords particle concentration distribution hyper concentrated flow turbulent transportation fractional liouville equation non local mixing 1 introduction most of the geophysical flows on the surface of earth are driven by gravity and turbulent by nature due to the presence of high flow velocity in turbulent flows through rivers sediment particles are transported which changes the river morphology this turbulent driven transportation is an important topic of fluvial processes on earth apart from it flows in slurry pipelines which are used transportation of materials minerals for plant processing coal to thermal plants waste fly materials etc along with a long distance also develop turbulent flows which has been verified experimentally kaushal and tomita 2002a b kaushal and tomita 2003a b kaushal and tomita 2007 in open channel turbulent flow over the erodible sand bed particles are transported through two major modes bed load transport and suspended load transport in turbulent flows the upward turbulent diffusion uplifts particles in the main flow zone against gravity when the downward settling of particles is balanced by the turbulent diffusion particles remain in the suspension layer and are transported with the flow several experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the presence of sediment particles changes the dynamics of carrier fluid significantly guo and julien 2001 among several aspects of the sediment mixed turbulent flows the distribution of particles over the whole fluid column plays a significant role to understand the mixing mechanism by turbulent diffusion and model transport process in the river unlike the bed load transportation process this distribution of particles in the suspended load layer is still not well understood especially for those flows where turbulent bursting phenomena play an important role and the presence of the high amount of particles in the flow pu et al 2016 in general in cases when the turbulent driven sediment laden flow is modeled a representative two dimensional plane is assumed due to the complexity of full 3d modelling pu and lim 2013 to describe the turbulent flows in two dimension several theories have been employed these can be listed as diffusion theory rouse 1937 hunt 1954 theory of local mixing length mctigue 1981 kovacs 1988 umeyama 1992 theory of gravitation velikanov 1958 theory of similarity lyn 1988 stochastic theory bechteler 1987 entropy theory chiu et al 2000 liu et al 2007 two phase flow theory jha and bombardelli 2010 greimann and holly 2001 kundu and ghoshal 2017 and recently non local mixing length theory kundu 2018 kundu 2019 in the description of diffusion theory the transport equation is the traditional convection diffusion equation this equation physically indicates that at any vertical level the upward transfer of particles by turbulent diffusion process is balanced by the settlement of particles along the downward direction and is referred to as the mirror effect wilson and sellgren 2003 most of the studies on sand particle distribution problems of type i are based on the diffusion theory including several effects apart from the diffusion theory all the aforementioned theories mostly focus on the type i profile of suspension concentration distribution where maximum particle concentration appears at the bottom of the suspended load layer also at the top of the bed load layer and it continuously decreases towards the free surface of the fluid apart from it other several types of suspension distribution patterns are observed in laboratory experiments and filed michalik 1973 bouvard and petkovic 1985 kaushal and tomita 2007 jacobson and testik 2013 fig 1 summarizes four different types of suspension profiles from the literature that are observed in different types of turbulent transportation problems in this figure apart from type i other profiles are referred to as type ii plume like and convex type profiles in a type ii profile the maximum value of the particle concentration appears at a certain height from the bottom of the suspended load layer the plume like profile is defined as partly convex and partly concave near the bed surface it shows a convex type shape that gradually changed to concave towards the upper portion the other profile is referred to as convex type that shows a fully convex shape over the full span of the profile wang and ni 1990 first proposed the classification of type i and type ii profiles from the experiments in turbulent flow through a square pipe jacobson and testik 2013 studied the structure of the concentration profiles in highly concentrated fluid mud gravity currents with constant volumes from their experiments shows that under the high presence of sediment particles plume like profiles are also observed apart from type i profiles on the other hand kaushal and tomita 2007 studied the distribution of particles in slurry pipeline turbulent flows they also reported the existence of other types of profiles than type i it is interesting to note that all the aforementioned theories except the recent non local mixing length theory can describe the type i profile only to study the type i profile the diffusion theory is frequently considered by several researchers rouse 1937 hunt 1954 kundu 2015 and reference therein a brief history of all type i profiles is presented by kundu 2015 though it has been considered by a large number of studies by scientists it has several limitations and drawbacks ni and wang 1991 a few of them are as follows it is based on single phase flow concept and a clear picture of particle dynamics is missing effects of near bed uplift force on particles particle inertia interactions between particles and particle and fluid particle velocity fluctuations and non local mixing in a wide scale have not been considered the diffusion theory always results in a negative concentration gradient i e dc dy 0 where c denotes mean volumetric sediment concentration and y denotes vertical coordinate whereas in the case of type ii profile and plume like profile dc dy 0 in the near bed region this suggests that diffusion theory can not describe the other mixing behavior of particles that exhibits other types of profiles to investigate structures of particle concentration profile wang and ni 1990 adopted kinetic theory which gives microscopic information later wang and ni 1990 wang and ni 1991 and ni et al 2000 adopted two phase based kinetic theory approaches to study suspension distribution incorporating fluid induced lift forces several researchers reported different reasons for the occurrence of type ii profiles ni and wang 1987 postulated that the occurrence of type i and type ii profiles can be explained using turbulent fluctuating properties of fluid and particles from his experimental results bouvard and petkovic 1985 found that turbulent diffusion significantly changes due to near bed uplift force of fluid and drag force fu et al 2001 proposed that the mixing process is affected by lift force and strength of particle velocity fluctuation and causes type ii profile wilson and sellgren 2003 investigated the effect of near wall and bed lift force on the particle suspension distributions in slurry pipelines and found that if particle diameter exceeds the length of viscous sublayer the particle is sifted upward from the near bed region by fluid uplift force kaushal and tomita 2007 experimentally investigated the suspension profiles in slurry pipelines they observed that due to the impact of viscous and turbulent interface near the bottom layers particle uplift forces appear jacobson and testik 2013 have done an experimental study on the structure of concentration profiles in constant volume fluid mud gravity current apart from the type i profile they also reported the existence of a plume like profile under such flows they suggested an empirical formula to find the concentration profiles see eq 25 for the empirical model from the results they found that the mixing process plays a significant role in the concentration profiles in gravity currents from the aforementioned discussions it can be claimed that though several reasons have been pointed out for the other types of concentration structures the inherent mixing process has not been fully understood it is clear that due to several effects mixing process changes significantly which afterward changes the structure of the suspension profiles though the kinetic theory and two phase flow theories are employed to investigate type ii profiles the effects of non local mixing have not been considered by others in the modern theory of turbulence it has been considered that turbulent bursting has a significant contribution to the mixing process it considers that bursting eddies near the bottom can eject particles from the surface of the bed to the water surface and thus results in a dispersion of wide range rather than the local short movement of particles in a small representative elementary volume under the influence of bursting particles present in near bed regions get a chance to swift vertically from their present location to an arbitrary distance up to a maximum to water surface chen et al 2013 these upward jumps beyond elementary distance δ y are considered as non local jumps these non local jumps can enhance the mixing process which is referred to as non local mixing process kundu 2018 to incorporate this effect chen et al 2013 proposed a space fractional ade in a one dimensional framework to investigate type i profile they found that fade gives a better estimation for type i profiles later kundu 2018 suggested the non local mixing length theory and proposed another space fractional ade equation to investigate the type i profile since in these fractional ade the fractional derivatives are involved it can capture the spread of solute particle mass over large distances which is significantly larger than an elementary volume through the convolutional definitions of these fractional derivatives the spatial fractional ade s extend the applicability and use of the integer order traditional ade by describing the superdiffusive rapid transport of a faster than fickian growth rates benson et al 2000 benson et al 2001 the nonlocal fade has been considered by several authors to simulate solute transport through unsaturated soils pachepsky et al 2001 zhang et al 2005 saturated porous media zhou and selim 2003 chang et al 2005 huang et al 2006 streams and rivers chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2005 kim and kavvas 2006 and overland flow deng et al 2006 but till now the effect of non locality has not been considered to investigate the different structures of suspension profiles this study makes the first attempt to explore this non locality effect on several structures of concentration profiles in different flows see fig 2 unlike the type i profile the studies on the occurrence and modelling of other types of profiles are limited in the literature the previous paragraph suggests that several authors investigate type ii profiles using different acting forces though the existence of other types of profiles is reported in literature only a few empirical models exist kaushal and tomita 2007 jacobson and testik 2013 also the effects of non locality have not been considered on type ii plume like and convex type profiles to include the effects of non locality and to capture a clear microscopic picture of the mixing process under such cases fractional kinetic models are considered in this study the governing equations with long range interactions or non local mixing can give spatial derivatives of fractional order tarasov and zaslavsky 2006 laskin and zaslavsky 2006 the caputo fractional derivative and riemann liouville integral are powerful tools to describe the non locality of power law type tarasov 2013 in traditional kinetic theory model by wang and ni 1990 and ni et al 2000 and two phase flow model by zhong et al 2011 the effect of non locality was not considered whereas the recent theory of turbulence indicates that due to turbulent bursts a particle can go up to any certain level which is beyond any small elementary volume this particular mixing behavior can be captured by fractional operators till now no fractional kinetic model has been employed by researchers to investigate the concentration profiles in turbulent flows the novelty of this work is to introduce a fractional kinetic model that will be appropriate for non local turbulent transportation theory apart from it other originality lies in the prediction of the fractional order and other model parameters using a single hidden layer artificial neural network ann model several models and methods exist for the estimation of parameters present in a model e g regression method hec ras model ardiçlioğlu and kuriqi 2019 and ann based models brunton and kutz 2019 among them ann has been considered as more appropriate as it establishes the link between inputs and outputs with some non linear type relations it becomes more appropriate in modelling hydraulic and hydrological phenomena nagy et al 2002 as they include highly non linearity ann models also have been applied to several environmental and hydrology engineering problems sahoo et al 2006 kim et al 2008 tsai et al 2009 application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000a application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000b brunton and kutz 2019 nagy et al 2002 developed ann to find suspension sediment concentration ssc using several parameters and also compared his result with traditional models the model gives the best result using ann with good discrepancy zhu et al 2007 applied the ann model to estimate suspended load in the yangtze river china and concluded that this model has an appropriate performance khan et al 2019 also adopted the ann model to study ssc and found that the ann model was capable of simulating suspended sediment concentration ssc accurately kumar et al 2020 studied the daily stage discharge in perennial river india using data driven methods these studies indicate that ann based approaches are more accurate in case of predicting results therefore in this study the ann based approach is employed for the estimation of the order of the fractional derivative the main objectives of this work are briefly discussed as follows i it is known from the existing literature that space fractional ade can capture the anomalous diffusion process and non local mixing of particles the space fade models also give better prediction results than the traditional ade till now the near bed lift force particle inertia particle particle interactions particle velocity fluctuations were considered as significant factors for the type ii profile this study aims to investigate whether non local mixing captured through fractional operators due to turbulent bursting affects the occurrence of different types of suspension profiles in natural streams open channels and other media ii apart from the ade the kinetic theory was introduced by wang and ni 1990 and ni et al 2000 for investigating suspension profiles of particles in turbulent flows these kinetic models do not include the effect of non locality therefore another aim of this work is to introduce a fractional kinetic model that captures the non local effect and to investigate whether it can describe concentration profiles other than type i as mentioned in fig 1 iii to make the model more applicable and cost effective the aim is also to find a full analytical closed form solution of the proposed fractional model iv most of the previous models on the type ii profile was validated only in open and closed channels for broad applicability of the solution it is proposed to validate the model solution under a wide variety of flow conditions including dilute and dense flow through open channels dilute and dense flow through circular and square pipes flows in mixing box flows in slurry pipelines and gravity driven fluid mudflow v for the prediction of model parameters regression analysis will be carried out it is also found that ann based approaches for parameter estimation give promising and better results than other methods therefore to propose an ann based model for better prediction and computation of model parameters including the fractional order of the derivative dimensional analysis is carried out and using these dimensionless variables an artificial neural network ann based model is proposed 2 theoretical background and traditional kinetic equation microscopic kinetic theory can capture the behavior of individual particles in two phase flows it was developed in the 1960s and has been considered by several scientists as it provides much more information than other theories in kinetic theory the motion of particles is described by the boltzmann equation marble 1963 culick 1964 pai 1971 for a two phase system all solid particles having same size and mass the boltzmann equation is described as 1 ϕ t v i ϕ x i f i ϕ v i ϕ t c where ϕ is the particle velocity distribution function which represents the number of particles at spatial position x i for i 1 2 3 at time t with velocities between v i to v i dv i f i is the external force per unit mass of particles this force includes the gravity force and the force of the fluid surrounding the particle the term on the right hand side of eq 1 denotes the collision term which describes the collisions between particles if the distribution function ϕ is known the number of particles n per unit volume is obtained as 2 n ϕ dv i to find n particle velocity distribution function ϕ is to be determined wang and ni 1990 and ni et al 2000 employed the entropy theory to derive the distribution function ϕ using lagrange s multiplier optimization method in both these studies the total acting forces on sand particle is considered as comprehensive lift force by the fluid and obtained a model of type ii distribution of particles as 3 n η n a η ζ 1 e z η η a ζ 1 e z η a where η z h dimensionless vertical height in which z is vertical co ordinate and h is a characteristic length of order to the channel height η a a h is the dimensionless reference level n a is the sediment concentration at the reference level η η a and ζ and z are two parameters the values of the parameters ζ and z are suggested by wang and ni 1990 as ζ 5 ω 0 u and z 1 6 d h ρ s ρ f for pipe flow and ζ 15 ω 0 u and z 1 18 d h ρ s ρ f for open channel flow here d denotes particle diameter wang and ni 1990 validated their model with the experimental data of wang and ni 1990 for square pipe and bouvard and petkovic 1985 for open channel flows both these experimental data considered in their studies are for dilute sediment suspension to derive eq 3 wang and ni 1990 neglected the collision term and therefore this equations is not applicable for dense suspension where collisions between particles plays significant role in a dilute flow the collision term can be neglected for dense or hyperconcentrated flow due to presence of high amount of particles inter particle and fluid particle interactions become important and the term on rhs of eq 1 cannot be neglected to find a solution of eq 1 for dense suspension due to the complexity of the collision term being a complex integral function some approximations of the collision terms are considered by ni et al 2000 with the analogy in the kinetic theory of gas molecules which is given as 4 ϕ t c ϕ ϕ 0 τ p where τ p is the relaxation factor which has the dimension of time and ϕ 0 is the particle velocity distribution in dilute flow the relaxation time has the magnitude of the order of the time interval between two consecutive collisions of a particle ni et al 2000 this relaxation time shows the development of a two phase flow from the nonequilibrium state to the equilibrium state therefore as in the kinetic theory of gases if the particle velocity components in every direction are same τ p is generally taken as ni et al 2000 5 τ p l v z where l describes a characteristic length in microscopic level which is proportional to the mean free path in case of vertical motion of particles in a solid liquid two phase flow which is roughly taken as a constant but may in fact be a function of particle properties ni et al 2000 and v z is the particle velocity along vertical z direction for steady dilute flows the collision effects represented by eq 4 can be approximately neglected wang and ni 1990 if we consider a steady dense flow with mean motion of particles in the z direction alone then the particle velocity distribution function ϕ in dense flow is obtained from the boltzman equation eq 1 after inserting eqs 4 and 5 as 6 ϕ ϕ 0 l v z v z d z α 0 c ϕ f z d v z 1 0 c ϕ where d z α 0 c and d v z α 0 c denote the caputo fractional derivatives of order α 1 with respect to variables z and v z respectively particle velocity distribution function ϕ can be obtained from eq 6 if some approximations of the d v z 1 0 c ϕ is assumed ni et al 2000 and ni et al 2003 suggested that as a first approximation these terms can be represented as 7 d v z 1 0 c ϕ d v z 1 0 c ϕ 0 m β ϕ 0 where m is the mass of the particle and β is a parameter which is the lagrange s multiplier therefore substituting eq 7 into eq 6 one obtains 8 ϕ ϕ 0 l d z 1 0 c ϕ lm β g ϕ 0 eq 8 gives the differential equation for the particle velocity distribution function in dense flow integrating eq 8 over the velocity space and using integration by parts as 9 ϕ dv i ϕ 0 dv i l d z 1 0 c ϕ dv i lm β g ϕ 0 dv i eq 9 can be rewritten in the dimensionless form as 10 n η l n η η 1 a 1 l n η where number of particles per unit volume in dilute flow n η ϕ 0 dv i η z h l l h a 1 is a constant taken as m β gh and h is the flow depth eq 10 provides the governing equation for suspension concentration distribution along vertical direction in a dense or hyperconcentrated turbulent flow equations from eq 4 to eq 10 was originally derived by ni et al 2000 and ni et al 2003 and reconsidered here only for the sake of completeness and understanding of the readers interested readers can go through there above mentioned original references for more further details ni et al 2003 validated eq 10 with the experimental data of michalik 1973 under dense flow condition same results are replotted here in fig 3 for four experimental test cases as run 1 4 6 and 8 for further discussion on the efficiency of eq 10 the details of these experimental runs are given in table 1 in fig 3 solutions of ni et al 2003 are plotted along x axis and experimental concentration data of michalik 1973 are plotted along y axis for all runs apart from it the y x line and best fitted line obtained using best linear fitting in matlab are also plotted in the figure if the best fitted line coincides with the y x line then prediction of model of ni et al 2003 can be considered as good it can be observed from the figure that except for run 6 which is a convex profile solutions predicted by eq 10 significantly deviates from the experimental data more precisely in the case of type ii profile run 4 and run 8 and plume like profile run 1 the predicted results from eq 10 are also not reasonably accurate this suggests that the single equation i e eq 10 cannot describe all different types of suspension profiles that are observed in experiments and also occur in real flows to predict all such types of suspension profiles and to understand the underlaying mixing process a more general model is required recently chen et al 2013 suggested that in a dilute flow the fraction diffusion equation provides much more appropriate results than classical diffusion equation from the time series experimental data of instantaneous reynolds shear stress and turbulent impulses of noguchi and nezu 2009 and chen et al 2013 found remarkable extreme events turbulent bursting occur beyond the limits of elementary volume this indicates that under bursting effects distance of vertical jumps of particles are not restricted smaller distance inside the consecutive elementary volumes defined as brownian motion and the probability that a particle jumps a given distance is very high and decay as a power law governed by an order α chen et al 2013 the classical diffusion equation is not able to capture this l e vy motion of particles chen et al 2013 and kundu 2018 suggested that to include this effect of non local transport in place of classical diffusion equation fractional derivative models in space variable can be a suitable choice following this idea in the next section a space fractional kinetic model and its analytical solution is introduced to describe non local transport under turbulent bursting effect and to predict different types of suspension profiles see table 1 3 proposition of space fractional governing equation and its solution the occurrence of the turbulent bursting significantly influence the inner mechanism of the exchange of the mass and momentum in recent theory of turbulence it is assumed that near bed eddies sweep particles from the surface of bed during bursting and can eject them to certain height in the water column which is not restricted to the short distance chen et al 2013 many experimental observations reported the effects of bursting on the wide spread pattern of dispersal rather the local particle mixing cao 1997 jackson 1976 offen and kline 1974 grass 1971 cellino and lemmin 2004 using a particle image velocimetry and hydrogen bubble generator mao 2003 found that multi ejections may occur in place of single ejection when shear reynolds number r 0 5 chen et al 2013 analyzed the instantaneous time series experimental data of reynolds shear stress of noguchi and nezu 2009 and found the existence of some events where the non local jumps of particles occurs in such type of transportation process density or mass distribution of random variable of particle jumps shows a power law tail which cannot be describe by the classical ade schumer et al 2009 particle jumps of power law type are frequently observed in bounded domain turbulent flows weeks et al 1996 later kundu 2018 extended the study of chen et al 2013 and suggested a modified fractional type model that holds for different forms of sediment diffusivity from these studies it can be concluded that non locality exists in turbulent flows and the fractional governing equation are important to capture such non local mixing processes though the space fade has been introduced but this model fails to capture the type ii or other types of suspension distribution mentioned in the introduction therefore a more general non local model is required for such type of flows where effect of non locality is present and sediment concentration exhibits other than type i profile to address this problem in this study we propose to use the space fractional liouville equations the boltzman or liouville equations with space fractional derivatives are capable to capture the spatial dispersion of power law type tarasov 2013 tarasov 2013 proposed different forms of the fractional liouville equations and applied to study spatial dispersion in plasma like media it is to be noted that if ϕ denotes the one particle reduced distribution function then the liouville equation describes collisionless system tarasov 2013 therefore in the spirit of tarasov 2013 the space fractional liouville equation with the collision terms for applicability in hyperconcentrated flows in eq 4 may be considered as 11 ϕ t v i d x i α 0 c ϕ f i d p i 1 0 c ϕ ϕ t c here x i and p i i 1 n are dimensionless variables d x i α 0 c and d v i 1 0 c denote the caputo type fractional derivatives of order α 0 α 1 and unity with respect to variables x i and v i respectively the caputo fractional derivative is a non local operator and its value depends on the values of the function ϕ from 0 to x i in spatial co ordinates the second term in the left hand side of eq 11 indicate the effect of non local mixing in spatial co ordinates eq 11 is similar to eq 1 except for the second term that considered the general caputo fractional derivatives this caputo fractional derivative reverts to the ordinary integer order derivatives if α approaches to unity podlubny 1999 and consequently eq 11 reverts to eq 1 due to its capability of capturing and describing complex long memory multiscale phenomena modelling transport in non local media anomalous dispersion and many other phenomena fractional operators have been applied in various branches of science and engineering sun et al 2018 giuseppe and massimiliano 2020 machado et al 2011 these aforementioned phenomena cannot fully captured by traditional mathematical approaches using classical differential calculus in several hydrology and environmental studies fractional calculus based approaches have been used also to give some examples benson et al 2000 used the fractional advection diffusion equation to study the movement of conservative tracers in sandbox deng et al 2004 showed that tracer movement in streams can be well described by the fade for surface water apart from these modeling transport at the earth surface schumer et al 2009 fractional dispersion in sand bed rivers bradley et al 2010 sediment transport on hillslopes georgiou et al 2010 overland solute transport deng et al 2006 and suspension distribution of sediment particles chen et al 2013 kundu 2018 kundu 2019 have been investigated using fractional governing equations among these studies chen et al 2013 and kundu 2018 employed the fractional differential equation to investigate suspension profiles of sediment particles kundu 2018 showed that fade models can be used to investigate suspension profiles other than type i profile though the fade s were used but till now no proper model for investigating other types of profiles has been proposed and validated with experimental data to find a proper model in this study we propose a fractional kinetic model that can used for finding different types of suspension profiles with non local effects to propose such equation eq 10 is first expressed into the following form as 12 d 1 n η ln η 1 a 1 l d 1 n η where sediment concentration at the elevation η 0 is assumed as zero and d 1 indicates the traditional integration operator in previous investigations to consider the nonlocal transport of particles in entire water column the linear space derivative is replaced by the space fractional derivative eq 12 can not capture the non local transport induced by the turbulent bursting phenomena therefore in flows where the sediment concentration distribution deviates from type i profile and effect of non locality is present the following fractional model is proposed as 13 0 d η α n η l n η 1 a l 0 d η α n η where l l a m β gh and η z h α 0 is the order of fractional integral here 0 d η α denotes the riemann liouville fractional integral of order α 0 see appendix for details this equation is referred as the space fractional kinetic equation it can be observed that eq 13 is similar to eq 12 obtained by ni et al 2000 except for the fractional integral term it can be seen that as the limiting case when α takes the value of integer eq 13 reverts to eq 12 as a particular equation similar type of equation is also proposed by saxena et al 2002 but till now has not been introduced in such studies it can be observed from eq 13 that the sediment concentration in a hyperconcentrated flow can be obtained from it in this study the closed form solution of the space fraction kinetic equation is obtained which is discussed in the next section 3 1 analytical solution the solution of eq 13 can be obtained if a suspension distribution of n η is assumed for dilute suspension previous studies show that in a dilute flow the suspension distribution follows a power law distribution graf 1971 laursen 1982 bose and dey 2009 since in this study we mainly focus to the solution of the fractional integral equation the distribution of n η in dilute flow is assumed to follow a power law as 14 n η n η a η a η z where z 2 π ω 0 u 0 ω 0 is the settling velocity of particle u is the shear velocity η a denotes the reference level which is generally considered as the common boundary of bed load and suspended load layers and n η a is the suspension concentration at the reference level similar type of suspension equation was also proposed by huang et al 2008 and bose and dey 2009 eq 14 is expressed in the following form for simplicity of calculation as 15 n η b 0 η μ α 1 where μ is a constant its value can be determined from experimental data z 1 α μ 0 and b 0 n η a η a 1 α μ inserting eq 15 into eq 13 and applying eq a 5 one gets the following equation after arrangement of terms as 16 n η λ 0 η μ 1 λ 1 0 d η α n η where λ 0 and λ 1 are parameters given as 17 λ 0 1 a l b 0 γ μ α l γ μ and λ 1 1 l to solve eq 16 we take the laplace transform on both sides and apply eq a 7 which gives 18 n s λ 0 γ μ s μ λ 1 s α n s where s denotes the new laplace transformed variable n s denotes the laplace transformation of n η and μ 0 for the existence of the laplace transformation of the function η μ 1 it should be noted that the laplace transformation method is employed for simplicity of presentation of solution the limitations of this methodology exists for the existence of laplace transformation of different functions apart form it in this study a power type solution eq 14 is assumed for the concentration distribution in dilute flow which may be considered as other limitation of the study though for other types of concentration distributions e g exponential type rouse type etc in dilute flow this study can be further extended with some other suitable method the solution of eq 18 can be expressed after taking the inverse laplace transform as 19 n η l 1 λ 0 γ μ s μ 1 λ 1 s α λ 0 γ μ k 0 1 k λ 1 k l 1 s μ α k λ 0 γ μ η μ 1 k 0 1 k λ 1 k η α k γ α k μ λ 0 γ μ η μ 1 e α μ λ 1 η α where e α μ t denotes the two parameter mittag leffler function podlubny 1999 eq 19 gives the concentration distribution throughout the flow depth in a dimensional form to get the dimensionless concentration distribution a initial condition can be used in most of the studies of suspension concentration distribution problems vertical height and suspended concentration are made dimensionless using the initial condition at the bottom of the suspended load layer above the bed load layer also known as reference level z a therefore in this study also the initial condition is considered as at η η a a h dimensionless reference level n η n η a n a called as reference concentration imposing the initial condition one obtains the following equation from eq 19 as 20 n η a λ 0 γ μ η a μ 1 e α μ λ 1 η a α dividing eq 19 by eq 20 the distribution equation for dimensionless suspension concentration in dense flow is obtained as 21 n η n η a η η a μ 1 e α μ λ 1 η α e α μ λ 1 η a α here n denotes the suspension concentration at height η where η a η 1 eq 21 shows that in hyperconcentrated flows the concentration is governed by a power type distribution along with mittag leffler function when the effect of non locality is considered eq 21 gives the more general form of suspension distribution this equation contains a number of equations proposed in literature as special cases if μ 1 and λ 1 ω 0 ε s where ε s denotes the depth averaged sediment diffusion coefficient are chosen this model revers to the model proposed by kundu 2018 as 22 n η n η a e α 1 λ 1 η α e α 1 λ 1 η a α which hold for type i suspension distributions and includes the effect of non locality apart from this further if one approximates e α μ λ 1 η a α 1 occurs when reference level is chosen very close to bed surface and choose μ 1 and λ 1 ω 0 ε s eq 21 takes the form 23 n η n η a e α 1 ω 0 ε s η α e α ω 0 ε s η α which gives a similar type of model as proposed by chen et al 2013 here e α t is the one parameter mittag leffler function further in a similar way if μ α 1 and λ 1 z is chosen eq 21 gives 24 n η n η a e z η η a which is the solution of the classical one dimensional ade proposed by lane and kalinske 1941 with constant settling velocity and sediment diffusivity and z 15 ω 0 u these models can describe type i and type ii profiles of suspension distribution through pipes and open channels apart from these two types of profiles another plume like profile is observed in fluid mud gravity current experiment by jacobson and testik 2013 in such flows the concentration is predicted by the following profile proposed by jacobson and testik 2013 25 n n a exp z k p where k is taken as constant called spread constant it is important to mention here that eq 25 is a special case of the proposed model here if one considers μ 1 α 1 η a 0 λ 1 k h p and scaling η z h p it reverts to the model considered in jacobson and testik 2013 further more if one replaces the mittag leffler function e α μ in eq 21 by the exponential function it will give a similar model proposed by wang and ni 1990 the mittag leffler function gives a more general form of the exponential function one can compute mittag leffler function by using series expansion podlubny 1999 or by using the matlab open source code available at http www mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 8738 mittag leffler function these above different cases suggest that eq 21 provides a more general equation to compute the suspension distribution in dense as well as dilute flows apart from this the proposed equation contains the effect of non locality and simple in form to apply further the proposed equation can also predicts different types of suspension distributions type i plume like type ii and convex type which is discussed in the next paragraph figs 4 and 5 illustrate the variation of n n a with order of fractional derivative α and parameter μ for different choices of l values after analyzing the results of these figures given by eq 21 we found that the model is able to predict four different types of suspension distribution including type i type ii plume like and convex type profiles the value of the parameters considered here are consistent with the experimental observations when μ 1 and α 1 is chosen model provides type i profile of suspension concentration which is similar to the results obtained by chen et al 2013 and kundu 2018 fig 4 illustrates the type i profile and fig 5 shows the other three types of profiles fig 4 shows the variation of the suspension profile obtained for α 1 0 9 0 8 0 7 and 0 6 with μ 1 and for two different values of l from the figure it can be observed that suspension profile becomes more non uniform for smaller values of l and as l increases suspension distribution becomes more uniform further for fixed values of l suspension profile also changes with the order of the fractional derivative α it can be observed that in both cases suspension profile gradually becomes uniform as α decreases physically the parameter α indicates the strength and probability of the non local mixing process the traditional local mixing scenerio occurs for α 1 and α 1 describes the non local mixing case kundu 2018 smaller values of α indicates the significant cases of non local mixing and in this cases particles can mix from a certain height to any vertical height kundu 2018 when α becomes smaller mixing process increases and occurs between two layers at any depth as a result sediment particles spreads over the whole vertical depth of the flow domain and suspension distribution becomes uniform alternately when α 1 and μ 1 model deviates from the traditional type i profile and gives plume like type ii and convex type profiles of suspension concentration in plume like profile maximum concentration occurs at reference level whereas in cases of type ii and convex type profiles maximum particle concentration of particles appears at some height above bed level fig 5 shows the results for these three cases in the figure the variation of suspension distribution with α is plotted with three different choices of parameter μ as 1 1 015 and 1 1 to illustrate that the proposed model can predict all three types of suspension profiles other than type i it can be seen from the figure that as α increases types of the profiles becomes more prominant figs 4 and 5 shows the advantage of the present study as the model covers a wide range of suspension profiles in literature the validation and prediction of the proposed model with field and laboratory experimental data is discussed in the next section 4 application and validation of proposed model to test the validity of the proposed model with a wide range and various types of experimental data several data sets have been chosen from dilute and dense flows through open channels square pipes circular pipes and mixing boxes the proposed model is validated with the experimental data for different types of turbulent flows in open channels closed square and circular pipes closed rectangular mixing box and mud flow through open channels as mentioned earlier that model contains the model of kundu 2018 that includes the effect of non locality and applicable for type i flows several models have been proposed in the literature for the distribution of type i profiles including effects of secondary current kundu and ghoshal 2014 non local effect chen et al 2013 kundu 2018 and others therefore the present study focuses on the suspension distribution of other types to that end experimental data that contains plume like type ii and convex type profiles are considered in this study experimental data of bouvard and petkovic 1985 and wang and qian 1989 are considered for validation in open channel dilute and dense flow respectively data of kaushal and tomita 2007 and michalik 1973 are considered for validation in dilute and dense flows through circular pipes respectively data of wang and ni 1990 is considered for validation of the models in dilute flow through closed square pipe data of matinpour et al 2019 is considered for validity in closed rectangular mixing box flow and data of jacobson and testik 2013 is considered for validity of proposed model in open channel gravity mud flow all these selected data are classified into open channel dilute and dense flow data circular pipe dilute and dense flow data closed square pipe data closed rectangular mixing box data and open channel fluid mud gravity current data all these cases are discussed in the following sections 4 1 applicability in open channel dilute and dense flows bouvard and petkovic 1985 experiment has been considered to validate the proposed new model for dilute flow through open channels the experiments were carried out in a laboratory flume of 0 35 m wide and 11 m long with adjustable slope throughout the experiment flow depth was kept as 0 075 m spherical plastic particles with diameter having the range from 2 to 9 mm have been used in the experiment as size of particles are large enough particles can be considered as gravel particle other flow conditions are given in table 1 fig 6 shows the validation of the dimensionless concentration profiles n n a together with the experimental data from the figure it can be observed that the proposed model agrees with the experimental data well throughout the flow depth and predicts the near bed deficiency of particles also this experimental results indicate that type ii profile occurs for gravel particles and proposed model can be applied to predict it in dilute open channel flows data set of wang and qian 1989 have been used to check the validity of the proposed model eq 21 for dense flow through open channels the experiment was conducted in recirculating flume of length 20 m width 30 cm with a wide range of sediment concentrations from 0 to 21 three types fine sf medium sm and coarse sc of plastic particles having density 1 052 gm cm3 and sand particles having density 2 64 gm cm3 have been used to examine the effects of light and heavy particles in the experiment type ii profile is observed for plastic particles the stokes number has a range from 0 003 to 0 035 details of flow conditions are shown in table 1 fig 7 presents the validation of present model with the experimental data of wang and qian 1989 among all the test cases runs that show other than type i profile are considered in this study average concentration in selected test cases has the range from 1 02 to 13 72 results in the figure clearly shows that proposed model predicts type ii and convex type profiles well 4 2 applicability in circular pipe dilute and hyperconcentrated dense flows experiments of kaushal and tomita 2007 has been used to test the validity of proposed fractional model in dilute flow through circular slurry pipeline for fine and medium sands kaushal and tomita 2007 performed the experiment in powder technology laboratory of kit japan the experiment was conducted in a 22 m long recirculating pipe loop two different size of particles having diameters 440 μ m and 125 μ m were used in the experiment the flow is performed with the help of a pump among all the data sets only type ii and convex type suspension profile data are considered in this study which are listed in table 1 with other details of the experiment fig 8 shows the validation of the proposed model with these selected data sets the average concentration ranges form 0 1 to 0 5 in the data set the values of parameters are presented in table 1 from fig 8 it can be concluded that proposed model can predict the behavior of type ii and convex suspension profiles in dilute flow through pipes in a similar way experimental results obtained by michalik 1973 are used to validate the present model for dense flow through pipes the experiment was carried out in a circular pipeline with internal diameter 200 mm using sand particles of density ρ s 2 65 gm cm3 under hyperconcentrated condition the average volumetric concentration is having the range from 0 15 to 0 54 in different test cases only the average concentration changes which emphasize the effect of inter particle collisions stokes number remains same for all test cases which is 0 0078 detail flow conditions are shown in table 1 fig 9 presents the relative particle concentration distribution in dense flow through pipes and compares the present model with experimental data of michalik 1973 previous study of kundu and ghoshal 2014 showed that the distance of location of maximum concentration from channel bed increases with increase of average concentration though the mean particle diameter density of particles shear velocity and particle settling velocity remain unchanged from fig 9 it can be observed that the proposed model predicts the location of maximum concentration point quite well further it is observed that the location of maximum concentration gradually approaches to the centerline of the pipe with the increase of average volumetric concentration these data set reflects the validity of model in dense pipe flow and that the parameters α μ and λ 1 changes with mean sediment concentration of the mixture 4 3 applicability in dilute flow through square pipe the data set of wang and ni 1990 is used to verify eq 21 for dilute flow through square pipes the experiments were carried out in a 4 6 cm2 square horizontal pipe using spherical plastic particles with mean diameter d having the range from 0 58 2 29 mm laser doppler anemometry lda was used to measure particle concentrations in these experiments stokes number changes from 0 008 to 0 056 the detail flow characteristics are given in table 1 fig 10 compares the present model with the selected experimental data of wang and ni 1990 from fig 10 it can be observed that the location of maximum concentration point shifts upward with the increase of particle diameter and for fixed particle material density ρ s the comparison results in this figure indicate that present model can be well applied in dilute flow through square pipes to measure type ii profile of particle suspension concentration 4 4 applicability in closed rectangular mixing box flows experimental data of matinpour et al 2019 is chosen to test the validity of proposed model in a rectangular mixing box flow the experiment was done in a rectangular polycarbonate tank of dimensions 0 32 m in cross section 0 40 m high and 0 01 m thick near the bottom of the box an aluminium grid of intersecting mesh of 0 01 m square rods and a mesh of spacing of 0 05 m was placed attached to a stainless steel bar with an eccentric connection to an external electrical motor experiments were performed with different volumetric concentrations of sand 0 3 0 45 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 4 the median grain diameter of sand particles was in the range of 0 37 0 4 mm and the density of sand particle was 2650 kg m3 particle image velocimetry piv is used to measure velocities of the fluid and sediment phases the suspended sediment concentration is calculated from the piv images using programme in matlab each sediment laden image is divided into 32 32 pixel windows and then volumetric concentration data were found by identifying sand particle counts in the image fig 11 shows the validation result of the proposed model it can be seen from the figure that proposed model predicts the type ii sand suspension profiles well through the flow depth it can be observed from the figure that the location of maximum concentration shifts towards the channel bottom when mean sand concentration increases and the model predicts that well 4 5 applicability in high concentration fluid mud gravity currents to extend the applicability of the proposed fractional model experiments by jacobson and testik 2013 in a high concentrated fluid mud gravity current is considered in this study apart from these two mentioned profiles in fluid mud gravity current a plume type profile is observed which occurs due to different mechanism and severity of the gravity jacobson and testik 2013 performed experiments in a plexiglas lock exchange tank that is 4 3 m long and 0 25 m wide an aluminium plate that separates the reservoir section from experimental section the plate initially holds the mud in the reservoir section and the water in the experimental section the aluminum lock gate was located 24 5 cm x0 24 5 cm from the wall in backside the mean particle diameter of mud was 0 7 μ m and particle density of 2 62 g cm3 the considered data which shows a plume like profiles are considered and presented in table 1 which as mean flow depth of about 21 to 25 cm fig 12 shows the validity of the present model it can be seen form this figure that not only the model predicts the experimental data well but also it predicts the plume like behavior of the concentration near the channel bottom 5 discussion and dependency of α μ and λ 1 on flow and particle properties previous studies of suspension concentration distribution using space factional advection diffusion by chen et al 2013 kundu 2018 and nie et al 2018 indicates that the fractional order that physically reflects the non local effect is not a constant parameter more precisely chen et al 2013 found that fractional order α depends on particle diameter and turbulent intensity later kundu 2018 has performed an in depth analysis of several experimental data sets from laboratory and field and concluded that the fractional order α also depends on specific gravity settling velocity of particle and shear velocity of the flow conclusion and findings of these studies are considered in this study also as it can be observed from table 1 that fractional order α is not a constant and may depend on flow and particle characteristics and this section shows and analyzes the dependency of the fractional order α and other model parameters μ and λ 1 on several factors this analysis makes the proposed model more easy for application purposes to that end a multivariate regression analysis is carried out to find appropriate functional forms of multiple variable for approximating parameter values apart form this a new artificial neural network ann based model is suggested to find those model parameters in recent years ann based approaches to approximate functions and to find hidden non linear relations between input and output has exponentially increased ann modelling has been applied in several fields of water resources engineering by asce task committee application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000a application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000b samani et al 2007 sahu et al 2011 to the best of author s knowledge this methodology has not been applied or proposed in modelling of different types of suspension distribution with including the effects of non locality with large number of data sets considered in this study this study proposes a ann based solution of parameter estimation problem these are discussed in the following subsections 5 1 method 1 regression analysis model fig 13 shows the variation of model parameters α μ and λ 1 with dimensionless particle diameter d settling velocity of particle ω 0 δ p and average concentration c c 100 the dimensionless particle diameter d is defined as d d s p 1 g ν f 2 1 3 in which s p ρ s ρ f is the specific gravity of particle ν f μ f ρ f is the kinematic viscosity of fluid μ f is viscosity of fluid and ρ f is density of fluid the parameter δ p is defined as s p 1 one can easily fit polynomials of certain degree to get an estimation of these parameters with respect each of these parameters but these results indicate that the parameters significantly depend on all these variables and therefore a multivariate relation would be more appropriate and reasonable to predict these parameters to predict the nature of α μ and λ 1 with those flow and particle properties a multivariate nonlinear regression analysis is carries out with total 49 number of values including all test cases from regression analysis the following relation are found suitable 26 α 2 4 2 9 d 0 1 0 0002 δ p 1 4 0 5 ω 0 u 1 95 5 4 c 0 004 9 5 0 3 d 0 29 9 13 δ p 0 0016 0 5 ω 0 u 1 88 0 0014 c 1 34 27 μ 2 41 4 23 d 0 22 263 94

1 10 6 δ p 4 54 9 08 ω 0 u 4 84 21 19 c 0 82 the computed values from the regression relation in eqs 26 28 are compared against the fitted values of all three parameters and results are plotted in figs 14 a 15 a and 16 a the value of the coefficient of regression r 2 are obtained as 0 85 0 9 and 0 87 for α μ and λ 1 respectively the residuals or error of the proposed nonlinear regression model is also shown in these figs 14 b 15 b and 16 b as histograms these figures show that it follows a normal density distribution which indicates that the proposed assumptions are appropriate eqs 26 28 can be applied to choose the order of the fractional power and other parameters when suspension distributions of different types are modeled using the fractional kinetic models from the validation results and experimental data it is found that the pattern of the suspension profile depends on the particle density or in other words on parameter δ p of particle the density of particle ranges from 1 006 gm cm3 to 2 65 gm cm3 for all experimental data considered due to the change in particle density settling velocity of particle also changes which further affects the underlying mixing process effects of particle density in terms of δ p on the suspension profiles are presented in fig 17 for two types of suspension profile namely type ii fig 17 and plume like fig 17 b the effects of particle density on other types of profiles can be obtained in a similar manner in the figure five different possible values of δ p are considered as 0 5 1 0 1 3 1 65 and 1 8 the values of other parameters are taken as η a 0 01 d 0 35 mm u 0 05 m s c 4 since with the change in δ p or particle density settling velocity also changes all the curves in fig 17 are plotted in the following manner first the value of δ p is chosen then settling velocity is calculated form the formula proposed by zhiyao et al 2008 as 29 ω 0 ν f d d 3 38 1 0 93 d 12 7 7 8 since values of fractional order α and other parameters μ and λ 1 depends on all these parameters then their values are computed from the proposed formulae in eqs 26 28 after computing all these parameters the suspension profile is computed from eq 21 in fig 17 b μ 1 01 is assumed for showing the result for plume like profile and other parameters α and λ 1 are computed form eqs 26 and 28 respectively from the results in both the cases figures it is found that suspension profile appears as uniform profile when δ p is small as the case for δ p 0 5 with the increase of δ p suspension profile becomes more non uniform this result can be explained as follows smaller values of δ p indicate lighter particle and when δ p increases particle becomes heavier light particles are easily transported by turbulent fluctuation against gravity than heavy particles apart form it by the turbulent bursting effect light particles jump larger distances compared to heavy particles due to these reasons mixing of lighter particles becomes highly non local processes and as a result suspension profile become more uniform whereas in case of heavy particles though non local mixing occurs but still may be limited to certain distances which results a more non uniform distributions these obtained results are in consistent with the experimental observations considered in this study 5 2 method 2 artificial neural network model in recent years artificial neural networks ann is regarded as one of the good modelling methods where there is a non linear relationship between input and output parameters also it is capable of predicting multivariate regression models well it is clear from the above section that fractional order α and other parameters μ and λ 1 show a non linear relationship with particle and flow properties such as particle diameter the density of the particle settling velocity shear velocity of flow and mean concentration in this section we propose an artificial neural network based modelling approach to predict those parameters with more high accuracy an ann is comprised of three layers input layer hidden layer and output layer every layer contains a certain number of neurons neurons in input and output layers receive data and give output respectively in the hidden layer neurons perform the data processing task with the help of weights and contact with other neurons these three layers form a network structure to get the solution from the given inputs according to ripley 1996 most of the functions can be well approximated using a single hidden layer therefore in this study we have chosen a single hidden layer neural network which is also known as shallow nn a schematic diagram is presented in fig 18 for all the three parameters as mentioned above from the above regression result it shows that all the model parameters depend on four variables namely dimensionless particle diameter d specific gravity δ p 1 dimensionless settling velocity ω u and average concentration c we consider these four quantities as an input variable and assume that 30 θ α μ λ 1 f d δ p ω u c where c c 10 2 the input layer takes the input of these four variables mentioned inside the functional symbol on the rhs of eq 30 and the output layer gives the output parameter as α or μ or λ 1 three layer feed forward back propagation network is designed using the neural net fitting toolbox of the matlab version r2020a in the hidden layer 25 neurons are considered total 49 data sets consisting of 196 data points are used to training validating and testing the nn for the training levenberg marquardt s back propagation training algorithm is used for parameter μ due to its high nonlinearity and scaled conjugate gradient algorithm is used for the parameters α and λ 1 which gives good results the mean squared error mse error and r 2 are chosen to find the performance of the models the total considered data set is randomly partitioned by the build in algorithm of matlab for training validation and testing with the ratio for training and testing validation as 70 and 30 respectively in the case of parameter μ 80 of the data set has been used for training and 20 data is utilized for validation and testing each fig 19 shows the summary of the performance achieved by the considered nn training tool along with an error histogram associated with the trained network for all three parameters first second and third rows in fig 19 are the results corresponding to the parameters α μ and λ 1 respectively the training algorithm divides the data set as mentioned earlier for training validation and testing purpose the scaled conjugate gradient and levenberg marquardt s algorithms with enabled backpropagation is then iterates with a maximum 1000 number of training epochs until the mse error achieves a minimum it can be seen from the figure that 20 37 and 22 epochs are sufficient to achieve the minimum error for parameters α μ and λ 1 respectively it can be observed from figs 19 a 19 c and 19 e that the difference of errors in testing and cross validation is within the reasonable limit for all three parameters which indicate the good performance of the nn to get the overall idea of the performance of the constructed nn comparison results between computed and target actual parameter values in table 1 are plotted for training validation testing and overall performance from fig 20 to fig 22 for three parameters in all figures a c indicates the comparison for training validation and testing respectively and d indicates the overall comparisons the r value in the figure indicates the r 2 value of fitting the overall r 2 values for the parameters α μ and λ 1 are 0 929 0 895 and 0 9096 respectively it can be observed that the higher r 2 values are obtained for all the parameters than the previous regression method these results indicate that the proposed nn based approach is much more efficient for predicting the values of the parameters it can be noted that the efficiency of this nn can be improved if more data sets are included 6 conclusions this study investigates the effects of non locality on the structure of suspension distribution of particles from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint the study starts with the fractional liouville equation and derived a fractional kinetic equation that includes the effect of non locality through space fractional caputo derivative the proposed governing equation is solved analytically and a simple analytical solution is obtained the model predicts four different types of profiles that occur in several real world turbulent transportation problems the following conclusions can are obtained see fig 21 1 the proposed solution of the fractional kinetic model is validated with large numbers of experimental data of different types validation results show that the model can be applied in dilute and dense flows through open channels and pipes to predict the waste materials in slurry pipelines and to predict the density of mud in a gravity mud flow it can also be concluded that the fractional kinetic model is more appropriate than standard kinetic equations 2 unlike the previous study the present model is validated for both sand and plastic particles it has been found that the model can be applied equally and gives good results for both types of particles 3 the proposed model contains two major parameters α the fractional order parameter and μ shape parameters parameter α physically signifies the underlying mixing process and μ constructs the shape of the profile physically α 1 signifies a subdiffusion process and α 1 shows a super diffusion process it is found that type i profiles are associated with the subdiffusion process whereas the other three types are associate with the superdiffusion process more precisely α 1 and μ 1 gives type i profile and α 1 and μ 1 shows other types of profiles 4 from the results of validations it is found that parameters α and μ depend on particle diameter the density of particles settling velocity of particle shear flow velocity and mean concentration of the flow mathematical models are proposed from regression analysis to calculate the values of these parameters further to increase the prediction accuracy of the models model parameters are estimated using ann models the ann models show better results than regression models and hence can be considered as an effective alternative to investigate model parameters this study is primarily focused to investigate the effects of non local mixing for different patterns of concentration distribution the solution in terms of the mittag leffler function is obtained from the proposed fractional kinetic model in this study uses the laplace transformation method and initial assumption of the dilute flow concentration model which is considered as a power function and thus give a limitation of it apart from it the restrictions of laplace transformation are also to be followed in the future the proposed solution can be improved by considering different types of dilute concentration distribution e g exponential type rouse type and others and using other general solution methodology apart from it another improvement can also be done by considering other general forms of fractional kinetic models credit authorship contribution statement snehasis kundu

4240,estimation of particle concentration distribution profile is important to understand the inherent mixing process changes of river morphology and nature of transportation of particles in this study the effects of non locality are investigated to analyze distinguish and predict different types of profiles of the suspended concentration distribution in turbulent flows through open channels pipes and mixing boxes the effects of non locality are captured through fractional derivatives and integrals starting from the fractional liouville equation and considering the power law jumps of particles in the carrier fluid the fractional kinetic equation is derived through mathematical analysis the kinetic model is solved and an analytical model is proposed using the laplace transformation the proposed solution contains the two parameters as α the order of fractional model and μ the shape parameter mittag leffler function and is a more general one that contains several previous models as special cases the proposed model can predict four different types of suspension concentration distributions namely type i type ii plume like and convex type profiles under different conditions further the model is validated with existing experimental data of dilute and dense flow in open channels and pipes flows in square pipes slurry pipelines and fluid mud gravity currents satisfactory results are obtained a detailed non linear multivariate regression analysis is carried out with a wide range of selected data and models are proposed to compute model parmeters to increase the efficiency of the model an artificial neural network ann model is proposed to predict the model parameters the ann based models show better results than the regression analysis validation results show that non locality has significant effects on the structure of the concentration profiles from the analysis of the model parameters it is found that type i profile occurs under the subdiffusion process where α 1 and μ 1 and other three types type ii plume like and convex of profiles are associated with the superdiffusion process when α 1 and μ 1 keywords particle concentration distribution hyper concentrated flow turbulent transportation fractional liouville equation non local mixing 1 introduction most of the geophysical flows on the surface of earth are driven by gravity and turbulent by nature due to the presence of high flow velocity in turbulent flows through rivers sediment particles are transported which changes the river morphology this turbulent driven transportation is an important topic of fluvial processes on earth apart from it flows in slurry pipelines which are used transportation of materials minerals for plant processing coal to thermal plants waste fly materials etc along with a long distance also develop turbulent flows which has been verified experimentally kaushal and tomita 2002a b kaushal and tomita 2003a b kaushal and tomita 2007 in open channel turbulent flow over the erodible sand bed particles are transported through two major modes bed load transport and suspended load transport in turbulent flows the upward turbulent diffusion uplifts particles in the main flow zone against gravity when the downward settling of particles is balanced by the turbulent diffusion particles remain in the suspension layer and are transported with the flow several experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the presence of sediment particles changes the dynamics of carrier fluid significantly guo and julien 2001 among several aspects of the sediment mixed turbulent flows the distribution of particles over the whole fluid column plays a significant role to understand the mixing mechanism by turbulent diffusion and model transport process in the river unlike the bed load transportation process this distribution of particles in the suspended load layer is still not well understood especially for those flows where turbulent bursting phenomena play an important role and the presence of the high amount of particles in the flow pu et al 2016 in general in cases when the turbulent driven sediment laden flow is modeled a representative two dimensional plane is assumed due to the complexity of full 3d modelling pu and lim 2013 to describe the turbulent flows in two dimension several theories have been employed these can be listed as diffusion theory rouse 1937 hunt 1954 theory of local mixing length mctigue 1981 kovacs 1988 umeyama 1992 theory of gravitation velikanov 1958 theory of similarity lyn 1988 stochastic theory bechteler 1987 entropy theory chiu et al 2000 liu et al 2007 two phase flow theory jha and bombardelli 2010 greimann and holly 2001 kundu and ghoshal 2017 and recently non local mixing length theory kundu 2018 kundu 2019 in the description of diffusion theory the transport equation is the traditional convection diffusion equation this equation physically indicates that at any vertical level the upward transfer of particles by turbulent diffusion process is balanced by the settlement of particles along the downward direction and is referred to as the mirror effect wilson and sellgren 2003 most of the studies on sand particle distribution problems of type i are based on the diffusion theory including several effects apart from the diffusion theory all the aforementioned theories mostly focus on the type i profile of suspension concentration distribution where maximum particle concentration appears at the bottom of the suspended load layer also at the top of the bed load layer and it continuously decreases towards the free surface of the fluid apart from it other several types of suspension distribution patterns are observed in laboratory experiments and filed michalik 1973 bouvard and petkovic 1985 kaushal and tomita 2007 jacobson and testik 2013 fig 1 summarizes four different types of suspension profiles from the literature that are observed in different types of turbulent transportation problems in this figure apart from type i other profiles are referred to as type ii plume like and convex type profiles in a type ii profile the maximum value of the particle concentration appears at a certain height from the bottom of the suspended load layer the plume like profile is defined as partly convex and partly concave near the bed surface it shows a convex type shape that gradually changed to concave towards the upper portion the other profile is referred to as convex type that shows a fully convex shape over the full span of the profile wang and ni 1990 first proposed the classification of type i and type ii profiles from the experiments in turbulent flow through a square pipe jacobson and testik 2013 studied the structure of the concentration profiles in highly concentrated fluid mud gravity currents with constant volumes from their experiments shows that under the high presence of sediment particles plume like profiles are also observed apart from type i profiles on the other hand kaushal and tomita 2007 studied the distribution of particles in slurry pipeline turbulent flows they also reported the existence of other types of profiles than type i it is interesting to note that all the aforementioned theories except the recent non local mixing length theory can describe the type i profile only to study the type i profile the diffusion theory is frequently considered by several researchers rouse 1937 hunt 1954 kundu 2015 and reference therein a brief history of all type i profiles is presented by kundu 2015 though it has been considered by a large number of studies by scientists it has several limitations and drawbacks ni and wang 1991 a few of them are as follows it is based on single phase flow concept and a clear picture of particle dynamics is missing effects of near bed uplift force on particles particle inertia interactions between particles and particle and fluid particle velocity fluctuations and non local mixing in a wide scale have not been considered the diffusion theory always results in a negative concentration gradient i e dc dy 0 where c denotes mean volumetric sediment concentration and y denotes vertical coordinate whereas in the case of type ii profile and plume like profile dc dy 0 in the near bed region this suggests that diffusion theory can not describe the other mixing behavior of particles that exhibits other types of profiles to investigate structures of particle concentration profile wang and ni 1990 adopted kinetic theory which gives microscopic information later wang and ni 1990 wang and ni 1991 and ni et al 2000 adopted two phase based kinetic theory approaches to study suspension distribution incorporating fluid induced lift forces several researchers reported different reasons for the occurrence of type ii profiles ni and wang 1987 postulated that the occurrence of type i and type ii profiles can be explained using turbulent fluctuating properties of fluid and particles from his experimental results bouvard and petkovic 1985 found that turbulent diffusion significantly changes due to near bed uplift force of fluid and drag force fu et al 2001 proposed that the mixing process is affected by lift force and strength of particle velocity fluctuation and causes type ii profile wilson and sellgren 2003 investigated the effect of near wall and bed lift force on the particle suspension distributions in slurry pipelines and found that if particle diameter exceeds the length of viscous sublayer the particle is sifted upward from the near bed region by fluid uplift force kaushal and tomita 2007 experimentally investigated the suspension profiles in slurry pipelines they observed that due to the impact of viscous and turbulent interface near the bottom layers particle uplift forces appear jacobson and testik 2013 have done an experimental study on the structure of concentration profiles in constant volume fluid mud gravity current apart from the type i profile they also reported the existence of a plume like profile under such flows they suggested an empirical formula to find the concentration profiles see eq 25 for the empirical model from the results they found that the mixing process plays a significant role in the concentration profiles in gravity currents from the aforementioned discussions it can be claimed that though several reasons have been pointed out for the other types of concentration structures the inherent mixing process has not been fully understood it is clear that due to several effects mixing process changes significantly which afterward changes the structure of the suspension profiles though the kinetic theory and two phase flow theories are employed to investigate type ii profiles the effects of non local mixing have not been considered by others in the modern theory of turbulence it has been considered that turbulent bursting has a significant contribution to the mixing process it considers that bursting eddies near the bottom can eject particles from the surface of the bed to the water surface and thus results in a dispersion of wide range rather than the local short movement of particles in a small representative elementary volume under the influence of bursting particles present in near bed regions get a chance to swift vertically from their present location to an arbitrary distance up to a maximum to water surface chen et al 2013 these upward jumps beyond elementary distance δ y are considered as non local jumps these non local jumps can enhance the mixing process which is referred to as non local mixing process kundu 2018 to incorporate this effect chen et al 2013 proposed a space fractional ade in a one dimensional framework to investigate type i profile they found that fade gives a better estimation for type i profiles later kundu 2018 suggested the non local mixing length theory and proposed another space fractional ade equation to investigate the type i profile since in these fractional ade the fractional derivatives are involved it can capture the spread of solute particle mass over large distances which is significantly larger than an elementary volume through the convolutional definitions of these fractional derivatives the spatial fractional ade s extend the applicability and use of the integer order traditional ade by describing the superdiffusive rapid transport of a faster than fickian growth rates benson et al 2000 benson et al 2001 the nonlocal fade has been considered by several authors to simulate solute transport through unsaturated soils pachepsky et al 2001 zhang et al 2005 saturated porous media zhou and selim 2003 chang et al 2005 huang et al 2006 streams and rivers chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2005 kim and kavvas 2006 and overland flow deng et al 2006 but till now the effect of non locality has not been considered to investigate the different structures of suspension profiles this study makes the first attempt to explore this non locality effect on several structures of concentration profiles in different flows see fig 2 unlike the type i profile the studies on the occurrence and modelling of other types of profiles are limited in the literature the previous paragraph suggests that several authors investigate type ii profiles using different acting forces though the existence of other types of profiles is reported in literature only a few empirical models exist kaushal and tomita 2007 jacobson and testik 2013 also the effects of non locality have not been considered on type ii plume like and convex type profiles to include the effects of non locality and to capture a clear microscopic picture of the mixing process under such cases fractional kinetic models are considered in this study the governing equations with long range interactions or non local mixing can give spatial derivatives of fractional order tarasov and zaslavsky 2006 laskin and zaslavsky 2006 the caputo fractional derivative and riemann liouville integral are powerful tools to describe the non locality of power law type tarasov 2013 in traditional kinetic theory model by wang and ni 1990 and ni et al 2000 and two phase flow model by zhong et al 2011 the effect of non locality was not considered whereas the recent theory of turbulence indicates that due to turbulent bursts a particle can go up to any certain level which is beyond any small elementary volume this particular mixing behavior can be captured by fractional operators till now no fractional kinetic model has been employed by researchers to investigate the concentration profiles in turbulent flows the novelty of this work is to introduce a fractional kinetic model that will be appropriate for non local turbulent transportation theory apart from it other originality lies in the prediction of the fractional order and other model parameters using a single hidden layer artificial neural network ann model several models and methods exist for the estimation of parameters present in a model e g regression method hec ras model ardiçlioğlu and kuriqi 2019 and ann based models brunton and kutz 2019 among them ann has been considered as more appropriate as it establishes the link between inputs and outputs with some non linear type relations it becomes more appropriate in modelling hydraulic and hydrological phenomena nagy et al 2002 as they include highly non linearity ann models also have been applied to several environmental and hydrology engineering problems sahoo et al 2006 kim et al 2008 tsai et al 2009 application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000a application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000b brunton and kutz 2019 nagy et al 2002 developed ann to find suspension sediment concentration ssc using several parameters and also compared his result with traditional models the model gives the best result using ann with good discrepancy zhu et al 2007 applied the ann model to estimate suspended load in the yangtze river china and concluded that this model has an appropriate performance khan et al 2019 also adopted the ann model to study ssc and found that the ann model was capable of simulating suspended sediment concentration ssc accurately kumar et al 2020 studied the daily stage discharge in perennial river india using data driven methods these studies indicate that ann based approaches are more accurate in case of predicting results therefore in this study the ann based approach is employed for the estimation of the order of the fractional derivative the main objectives of this work are briefly discussed as follows i it is known from the existing literature that space fractional ade can capture the anomalous diffusion process and non local mixing of particles the space fade models also give better prediction results than the traditional ade till now the near bed lift force particle inertia particle particle interactions particle velocity fluctuations were considered as significant factors for the type ii profile this study aims to investigate whether non local mixing captured through fractional operators due to turbulent bursting affects the occurrence of different types of suspension profiles in natural streams open channels and other media ii apart from the ade the kinetic theory was introduced by wang and ni 1990 and ni et al 2000 for investigating suspension profiles of particles in turbulent flows these kinetic models do not include the effect of non locality therefore another aim of this work is to introduce a fractional kinetic model that captures the non local effect and to investigate whether it can describe concentration profiles other than type i as mentioned in fig 1 iii to make the model more applicable and cost effective the aim is also to find a full analytical closed form solution of the proposed fractional model iv most of the previous models on the type ii profile was validated only in open and closed channels for broad applicability of the solution it is proposed to validate the model solution under a wide variety of flow conditions including dilute and dense flow through open channels dilute and dense flow through circular and square pipes flows in mixing box flows in slurry pipelines and gravity driven fluid mudflow v for the prediction of model parameters regression analysis will be carried out it is also found that ann based approaches for parameter estimation give promising and better results than other methods therefore to propose an ann based model for better prediction and computation of model parameters including the fractional order of the derivative dimensional analysis is carried out and using these dimensionless variables an artificial neural network ann based model is proposed 2 theoretical background and traditional kinetic equation microscopic kinetic theory can capture the behavior of individual particles in two phase flows it was developed in the 1960s and has been considered by several scientists as it provides much more information than other theories in kinetic theory the motion of particles is described by the boltzmann equation marble 1963 culick 1964 pai 1971 for a two phase system all solid particles having same size and mass the boltzmann equation is described as 1 ϕ t v i ϕ x i f i ϕ v i ϕ t c where ϕ is the particle velocity distribution function which represents the number of particles at spatial position x i for i 1 2 3 at time t with velocities between v i to v i dv i f i is the external force per unit mass of particles this force includes the gravity force and the force of the fluid surrounding the particle the term on the right hand side of eq 1 denotes the collision term which describes the collisions between particles if the distribution function ϕ is known the number of particles n per unit volume is obtained as 2 n ϕ dv i to find n particle velocity distribution function ϕ is to be determined wang and ni 1990 and ni et al 2000 employed the entropy theory to derive the distribution function ϕ using lagrange s multiplier optimization method in both these studies the total acting forces on sand particle is considered as comprehensive lift force by the fluid and obtained a model of type ii distribution of particles as 3 n η n a η ζ 1 e z η η a ζ 1 e z η a where η z h dimensionless vertical height in which z is vertical co ordinate and h is a characteristic length of order to the channel height η a a h is the dimensionless reference level n a is the sediment concentration at the reference level η η a and ζ and z are two parameters the values of the parameters ζ and z are suggested by wang and ni 1990 as ζ 5 ω 0 u and z 1 6 d h ρ s ρ f for pipe flow and ζ 15 ω 0 u and z 1 18 d h ρ s ρ f for open channel flow here d denotes particle diameter wang and ni 1990 validated their model with the experimental data of wang and ni 1990 for square pipe and bouvard and petkovic 1985 for open channel flows both these experimental data considered in their studies are for dilute sediment suspension to derive eq 3 wang and ni 1990 neglected the collision term and therefore this equations is not applicable for dense suspension where collisions between particles plays significant role in a dilute flow the collision term can be neglected for dense or hyperconcentrated flow due to presence of high amount of particles inter particle and fluid particle interactions become important and the term on rhs of eq 1 cannot be neglected to find a solution of eq 1 for dense suspension due to the complexity of the collision term being a complex integral function some approximations of the collision terms are considered by ni et al 2000 with the analogy in the kinetic theory of gas molecules which is given as 4 ϕ t c ϕ ϕ 0 τ p where τ p is the relaxation factor which has the dimension of time and ϕ 0 is the particle velocity distribution in dilute flow the relaxation time has the magnitude of the order of the time interval between two consecutive collisions of a particle ni et al 2000 this relaxation time shows the development of a two phase flow from the nonequilibrium state to the equilibrium state therefore as in the kinetic theory of gases if the particle velocity components in every direction are same τ p is generally taken as ni et al 2000 5 τ p l v z where l describes a characteristic length in microscopic level which is proportional to the mean free path in case of vertical motion of particles in a solid liquid two phase flow which is roughly taken as a constant but may in fact be a function of particle properties ni et al 2000 and v z is the particle velocity along vertical z direction for steady dilute flows the collision effects represented by eq 4 can be approximately neglected wang and ni 1990 if we consider a steady dense flow with mean motion of particles in the z direction alone then the particle velocity distribution function ϕ in dense flow is obtained from the boltzman equation eq 1 after inserting eqs 4 and 5 as 6 ϕ ϕ 0 l v z v z d z α 0 c ϕ f z d v z 1 0 c ϕ where d z α 0 c and d v z α 0 c denote the caputo fractional derivatives of order α 1 with respect to variables z and v z respectively particle velocity distribution function ϕ can be obtained from eq 6 if some approximations of the d v z 1 0 c ϕ is assumed ni et al 2000 and ni et al 2003 suggested that as a first approximation these terms can be represented as 7 d v z 1 0 c ϕ d v z 1 0 c ϕ 0 m β ϕ 0 where m is the mass of the particle and β is a parameter which is the lagrange s multiplier therefore substituting eq 7 into eq 6 one obtains 8 ϕ ϕ 0 l d z 1 0 c ϕ lm β g ϕ 0 eq 8 gives the differential equation for the particle velocity distribution function in dense flow integrating eq 8 over the velocity space and using integration by parts as 9 ϕ dv i ϕ 0 dv i l d z 1 0 c ϕ dv i lm β g ϕ 0 dv i eq 9 can be rewritten in the dimensionless form as 10 n η l n η η 1 a 1 l n η where number of particles per unit volume in dilute flow n η ϕ 0 dv i η z h l l h a 1 is a constant taken as m β gh and h is the flow depth eq 10 provides the governing equation for suspension concentration distribution along vertical direction in a dense or hyperconcentrated turbulent flow equations from eq 4 to eq 10 was originally derived by ni et al 2000 and ni et al 2003 and reconsidered here only for the sake of completeness and understanding of the readers interested readers can go through there above mentioned original references for more further details ni et al 2003 validated eq 10 with the experimental data of michalik 1973 under dense flow condition same results are replotted here in fig 3 for four experimental test cases as run 1 4 6 and 8 for further discussion on the efficiency of eq 10 the details of these experimental runs are given in table 1 in fig 3 solutions of ni et al 2003 are plotted along x axis and experimental concentration data of michalik 1973 are plotted along y axis for all runs apart from it the y x line and best fitted line obtained using best linear fitting in matlab are also plotted in the figure if the best fitted line coincides with the y x line then prediction of model of ni et al 2003 can be considered as good it can be observed from the figure that except for run 6 which is a convex profile solutions predicted by eq 10 significantly deviates from the experimental data more precisely in the case of type ii profile run 4 and run 8 and plume like profile run 1 the predicted results from eq 10 are also not reasonably accurate this suggests that the single equation i e eq 10 cannot describe all different types of suspension profiles that are observed in experiments and also occur in real flows to predict all such types of suspension profiles and to understand the underlaying mixing process a more general model is required recently chen et al 2013 suggested that in a dilute flow the fraction diffusion equation provides much more appropriate results than classical diffusion equation from the time series experimental data of instantaneous reynolds shear stress and turbulent impulses of noguchi and nezu 2009 and chen et al 2013 found remarkable extreme events turbulent bursting occur beyond the limits of elementary volume this indicates that under bursting effects distance of vertical jumps of particles are not restricted smaller distance inside the consecutive elementary volumes defined as brownian motion and the probability that a particle jumps a given distance is very high and decay as a power law governed by an order α chen et al 2013 the classical diffusion equation is not able to capture this l e vy motion of particles chen et al 2013 and kundu 2018 suggested that to include this effect of non local transport in place of classical diffusion equation fractional derivative models in space variable can be a suitable choice following this idea in the next section a space fractional kinetic model and its analytical solution is introduced to describe non local transport under turbulent bursting effect and to predict different types of suspension profiles see table 1 3 proposition of space fractional governing equation and its solution the occurrence of the turbulent bursting significantly influence the inner mechanism of the exchange of the mass and momentum in recent theory of turbulence it is assumed that near bed eddies sweep particles from the surface of bed during bursting and can eject them to certain height in the water column which is not restricted to the short distance chen et al 2013 many experimental observations reported the effects of bursting on the wide spread pattern of dispersal rather the local particle mixing cao 1997 jackson 1976 offen and kline 1974 grass 1971 cellino and lemmin 2004 using a particle image velocimetry and hydrogen bubble generator mao 2003 found that multi ejections may occur in place of single ejection when shear reynolds number r 0 5 chen et al 2013 analyzed the instantaneous time series experimental data of reynolds shear stress of noguchi and nezu 2009 and found the existence of some events where the non local jumps of particles occurs in such type of transportation process density or mass distribution of random variable of particle jumps shows a power law tail which cannot be describe by the classical ade schumer et al 2009 particle jumps of power law type are frequently observed in bounded domain turbulent flows weeks et al 1996 later kundu 2018 extended the study of chen et al 2013 and suggested a modified fractional type model that holds for different forms of sediment diffusivity from these studies it can be concluded that non locality exists in turbulent flows and the fractional governing equation are important to capture such non local mixing processes though the space fade has been introduced but this model fails to capture the type ii or other types of suspension distribution mentioned in the introduction therefore a more general non local model is required for such type of flows where effect of non locality is present and sediment concentration exhibits other than type i profile to address this problem in this study we propose to use the space fractional liouville equations the boltzman or liouville equations with space fractional derivatives are capable to capture the spatial dispersion of power law type tarasov 2013 tarasov 2013 proposed different forms of the fractional liouville equations and applied to study spatial dispersion in plasma like media it is to be noted that if ϕ denotes the one particle reduced distribution function then the liouville equation describes collisionless system tarasov 2013 therefore in the spirit of tarasov 2013 the space fractional liouville equation with the collision terms for applicability in hyperconcentrated flows in eq 4 may be considered as 11 ϕ t v i d x i α 0 c ϕ f i d p i 1 0 c ϕ ϕ t c here x i and p i i 1 n are dimensionless variables d x i α 0 c and d v i 1 0 c denote the caputo type fractional derivatives of order α 0 α 1 and unity with respect to variables x i and v i respectively the caputo fractional derivative is a non local operator and its value depends on the values of the function ϕ from 0 to x i in spatial co ordinates the second term in the left hand side of eq 11 indicate the effect of non local mixing in spatial co ordinates eq 11 is similar to eq 1 except for the second term that considered the general caputo fractional derivatives this caputo fractional derivative reverts to the ordinary integer order derivatives if α approaches to unity podlubny 1999 and consequently eq 11 reverts to eq 1 due to its capability of capturing and describing complex long memory multiscale phenomena modelling transport in non local media anomalous dispersion and many other phenomena fractional operators have been applied in various branches of science and engineering sun et al 2018 giuseppe and massimiliano 2020 machado et al 2011 these aforementioned phenomena cannot fully captured by traditional mathematical approaches using classical differential calculus in several hydrology and environmental studies fractional calculus based approaches have been used also to give some examples benson et al 2000 used the fractional advection diffusion equation to study the movement of conservative tracers in sandbox deng et al 2004 showed that tracer movement in streams can be well described by the fade for surface water apart from these modeling transport at the earth surface schumer et al 2009 fractional dispersion in sand bed rivers bradley et al 2010 sediment transport on hillslopes georgiou et al 2010 overland solute transport deng et al 2006 and suspension distribution of sediment particles chen et al 2013 kundu 2018 kundu 2019 have been investigated using fractional governing equations among these studies chen et al 2013 and kundu 2018 employed the fractional differential equation to investigate suspension profiles of sediment particles kundu 2018 showed that fade models can be used to investigate suspension profiles other than type i profile though the fade s were used but till now no proper model for investigating other types of profiles has been proposed and validated with experimental data to find a proper model in this study we propose a fractional kinetic model that can used for finding different types of suspension profiles with non local effects to propose such equation eq 10 is first expressed into the following form as 12 d 1 n η ln η 1 a 1 l d 1 n η where sediment concentration at the elevation η 0 is assumed as zero and d 1 indicates the traditional integration operator in previous investigations to consider the nonlocal transport of particles in entire water column the linear space derivative is replaced by the space fractional derivative eq 12 can not capture the non local transport induced by the turbulent bursting phenomena therefore in flows where the sediment concentration distribution deviates from type i profile and effect of non locality is present the following fractional model is proposed as 13 0 d η α n η l n η 1 a l 0 d η α n η where l l a m β gh and η z h α 0 is the order of fractional integral here 0 d η α denotes the riemann liouville fractional integral of order α 0 see appendix for details this equation is referred as the space fractional kinetic equation it can be observed that eq 13 is similar to eq 12 obtained by ni et al 2000 except for the fractional integral term it can be seen that as the limiting case when α takes the value of integer eq 13 reverts to eq 12 as a particular equation similar type of equation is also proposed by saxena et al 2002 but till now has not been introduced in such studies it can be observed from eq 13 that the sediment concentration in a hyperconcentrated flow can be obtained from it in this study the closed form solution of the space fraction kinetic equation is obtained which is discussed in the next section 3 1 analytical solution the solution of eq 13 can be obtained if a suspension distribution of n η is assumed for dilute suspension previous studies show that in a dilute flow the suspension distribution follows a power law distribution graf 1971 laursen 1982 bose and dey 2009 since in this study we mainly focus to the solution of the fractional integral equation the distribution of n η in dilute flow is assumed to follow a power law as 14 n η n η a η a η z where z 2 π ω 0 u 0 ω 0 is the settling velocity of particle u is the shear velocity η a denotes the reference level which is generally considered as the common boundary of bed load and suspended load layers and n η a is the suspension concentration at the reference level similar type of suspension equation was also proposed by huang et al 2008 and bose and dey 2009 eq 14 is expressed in the following form for simplicity of calculation as 15 n η b 0 η μ α 1 where μ is a constant its value can be determined from experimental data z 1 α μ 0 and b 0 n η a η a 1 α μ inserting eq 15 into eq 13 and applying eq a 5 one gets the following equation after arrangement of terms as 16 n η λ 0 η μ 1 λ 1 0 d η α n η where λ 0 and λ 1 are parameters given as 17 λ 0 1 a l b 0 γ μ α l γ μ and λ 1 1 l to solve eq 16 we take the laplace transform on both sides and apply eq a 7 which gives 18 n s λ 0 γ μ s μ λ 1 s α n s where s denotes the new laplace transformed variable n s denotes the laplace transformation of n η and μ 0 for the existence of the laplace transformation of the function η μ 1 it should be noted that the laplace transformation method is employed for simplicity of presentation of solution the limitations of this methodology exists for the existence of laplace transformation of different functions apart form it in this study a power type solution eq 14 is assumed for the concentration distribution in dilute flow which may be considered as other limitation of the study though for other types of concentration distributions e g exponential type rouse type etc in dilute flow this study can be further extended with some other suitable method the solution of eq 18 can be expressed after taking the inverse laplace transform as 19 n η l 1 λ 0 γ μ s μ 1 λ 1 s α λ 0 γ μ k 0 1 k λ 1 k l 1 s μ α k λ 0 γ μ η μ 1 k 0 1 k λ 1 k η α k γ α k μ λ 0 γ μ η μ 1 e α μ λ 1 η α where e α μ t denotes the two parameter mittag leffler function podlubny 1999 eq 19 gives the concentration distribution throughout the flow depth in a dimensional form to get the dimensionless concentration distribution a initial condition can be used in most of the studies of suspension concentration distribution problems vertical height and suspended concentration are made dimensionless using the initial condition at the bottom of the suspended load layer above the bed load layer also known as reference level z a therefore in this study also the initial condition is considered as at η η a a h dimensionless reference level n η n η a n a called as reference concentration imposing the initial condition one obtains the following equation from eq 19 as 20 n η a λ 0 γ μ η a μ 1 e α μ λ 1 η a α dividing eq 19 by eq 20 the distribution equation for dimensionless suspension concentration in dense flow is obtained as 21 n η n η a η η a μ 1 e α μ λ 1 η α e α μ λ 1 η a α here n denotes the suspension concentration at height η where η a η 1 eq 21 shows that in hyperconcentrated flows the concentration is governed by a power type distribution along with mittag leffler function when the effect of non locality is considered eq 21 gives the more general form of suspension distribution this equation contains a number of equations proposed in literature as special cases if μ 1 and λ 1 ω 0 ε s where ε s denotes the depth averaged sediment diffusion coefficient are chosen this model revers to the model proposed by kundu 2018 as 22 n η n η a e α 1 λ 1 η α e α 1 λ 1 η a α which hold for type i suspension distributions and includes the effect of non locality apart from this further if one approximates e α μ λ 1 η a α 1 occurs when reference level is chosen very close to bed surface and choose μ 1 and λ 1 ω 0 ε s eq 21 takes the form 23 n η n η a e α 1 ω 0 ε s η α e α ω 0 ε s η α which gives a similar type of model as proposed by chen et al 2013 here e α t is the one parameter mittag leffler function further in a similar way if μ α 1 and λ 1 z is chosen eq 21 gives 24 n η n η a e z η η a which is the solution of the classical one dimensional ade proposed by lane and kalinske 1941 with constant settling velocity and sediment diffusivity and z 15 ω 0 u these models can describe type i and type ii profiles of suspension distribution through pipes and open channels apart from these two types of profiles another plume like profile is observed in fluid mud gravity current experiment by jacobson and testik 2013 in such flows the concentration is predicted by the following profile proposed by jacobson and testik 2013 25 n n a exp z k p where k is taken as constant called spread constant it is important to mention here that eq 25 is a special case of the proposed model here if one considers μ 1 α 1 η a 0 λ 1 k h p and scaling η z h p it reverts to the model considered in jacobson and testik 2013 further more if one replaces the mittag leffler function e α μ in eq 21 by the exponential function it will give a similar model proposed by wang and ni 1990 the mittag leffler function gives a more general form of the exponential function one can compute mittag leffler function by using series expansion podlubny 1999 or by using the matlab open source code available at http www mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 8738 mittag leffler function these above different cases suggest that eq 21 provides a more general equation to compute the suspension distribution in dense as well as dilute flows apart from this the proposed equation contains the effect of non locality and simple in form to apply further the proposed equation can also predicts different types of suspension distributions type i plume like type ii and convex type which is discussed in the next paragraph figs 4 and 5 illustrate the variation of n n a with order of fractional derivative α and parameter μ for different choices of l values after analyzing the results of these figures given by eq 21 we found that the model is able to predict four different types of suspension distribution including type i type ii plume like and convex type profiles the value of the parameters considered here are consistent with the experimental observations when μ 1 and α 1 is chosen model provides type i profile of suspension concentration which is similar to the results obtained by chen et al 2013 and kundu 2018 fig 4 illustrates the type i profile and fig 5 shows the other three types of profiles fig 4 shows the variation of the suspension profile obtained for α 1 0 9 0 8 0 7 and 0 6 with μ 1 and for two different values of l from the figure it can be observed that suspension profile becomes more non uniform for smaller values of l and as l increases suspension distribution becomes more uniform further for fixed values of l suspension profile also changes with the order of the fractional derivative α it can be observed that in both cases suspension profile gradually becomes uniform as α decreases physically the parameter α indicates the strength and probability of the non local mixing process the traditional local mixing scenerio occurs for α 1 and α 1 describes the non local mixing case kundu 2018 smaller values of α indicates the significant cases of non local mixing and in this cases particles can mix from a certain height to any vertical height kundu 2018 when α becomes smaller mixing process increases and occurs between two layers at any depth as a result sediment particles spreads over the whole vertical depth of the flow domain and suspension distribution becomes uniform alternately when α 1 and μ 1 model deviates from the traditional type i profile and gives plume like type ii and convex type profiles of suspension concentration in plume like profile maximum concentration occurs at reference level whereas in cases of type ii and convex type profiles maximum particle concentration of particles appears at some height above bed level fig 5 shows the results for these three cases in the figure the variation of suspension distribution with α is plotted with three different choices of parameter μ as 1 1 015 and 1 1 to illustrate that the proposed model can predict all three types of suspension profiles other than type i it can be seen from the figure that as α increases types of the profiles becomes more prominant figs 4 and 5 shows the advantage of the present study as the model covers a wide range of suspension profiles in literature the validation and prediction of the proposed model with field and laboratory experimental data is discussed in the next section 4 application and validation of proposed model to test the validity of the proposed model with a wide range and various types of experimental data several data sets have been chosen from dilute and dense flows through open channels square pipes circular pipes and mixing boxes the proposed model is validated with the experimental data for different types of turbulent flows in open channels closed square and circular pipes closed rectangular mixing box and mud flow through open channels as mentioned earlier that model contains the model of kundu 2018 that includes the effect of non locality and applicable for type i flows several models have been proposed in the literature for the distribution of type i profiles including effects of secondary current kundu and ghoshal 2014 non local effect chen et al 2013 kundu 2018 and others therefore the present study focuses on the suspension distribution of other types to that end experimental data that contains plume like type ii and convex type profiles are considered in this study experimental data of bouvard and petkovic 1985 and wang and qian 1989 are considered for validation in open channel dilute and dense flow respectively data of kaushal and tomita 2007 and michalik 1973 are considered for validation in dilute and dense flows through circular pipes respectively data of wang and ni 1990 is considered for validation of the models in dilute flow through closed square pipe data of matinpour et al 2019 is considered for validity in closed rectangular mixing box flow and data of jacobson and testik 2013 is considered for validity of proposed model in open channel gravity mud flow all these selected data are classified into open channel dilute and dense flow data circular pipe dilute and dense flow data closed square pipe data closed rectangular mixing box data and open channel fluid mud gravity current data all these cases are discussed in the following sections 4 1 applicability in open channel dilute and dense flows bouvard and petkovic 1985 experiment has been considered to validate the proposed new model for dilute flow through open channels the experiments were carried out in a laboratory flume of 0 35 m wide and 11 m long with adjustable slope throughout the experiment flow depth was kept as 0 075 m spherical plastic particles with diameter having the range from 2 to 9 mm have been used in the experiment as size of particles are large enough particles can be considered as gravel particle other flow conditions are given in table 1 fig 6 shows the validation of the dimensionless concentration profiles n n a together with the experimental data from the figure it can be observed that the proposed model agrees with the experimental data well throughout the flow depth and predicts the near bed deficiency of particles also this experimental results indicate that type ii profile occurs for gravel particles and proposed model can be applied to predict it in dilute open channel flows data set of wang and qian 1989 have been used to check the validity of the proposed model eq 21 for dense flow through open channels the experiment was conducted in recirculating flume of length 20 m width 30 cm with a wide range of sediment concentrations from 0 to 21 three types fine sf medium sm and coarse sc of plastic particles having density 1 052 gm cm3 and sand particles having density 2 64 gm cm3 have been used to examine the effects of light and heavy particles in the experiment type ii profile is observed for plastic particles the stokes number has a range from 0 003 to 0 035 details of flow conditions are shown in table 1 fig 7 presents the validation of present model with the experimental data of wang and qian 1989 among all the test cases runs that show other than type i profile are considered in this study average concentration in selected test cases has the range from 1 02 to 13 72 results in the figure clearly shows that proposed model predicts type ii and convex type profiles well 4 2 applicability in circular pipe dilute and hyperconcentrated dense flows experiments of kaushal and tomita 2007 has been used to test the validity of proposed fractional model in dilute flow through circular slurry pipeline for fine and medium sands kaushal and tomita 2007 performed the experiment in powder technology laboratory of kit japan the experiment was conducted in a 22 m long recirculating pipe loop two different size of particles having diameters 440 μ m and 125 μ m were used in the experiment the flow is performed with the help of a pump among all the data sets only type ii and convex type suspension profile data are considered in this study which are listed in table 1 with other details of the experiment fig 8 shows the validation of the proposed model with these selected data sets the average concentration ranges form 0 1 to 0 5 in the data set the values of parameters are presented in table 1 from fig 8 it can be concluded that proposed model can predict the behavior of type ii and convex suspension profiles in dilute flow through pipes in a similar way experimental results obtained by michalik 1973 are used to validate the present model for dense flow through pipes the experiment was carried out in a circular pipeline with internal diameter 200 mm using sand particles of density ρ s 2 65 gm cm3 under hyperconcentrated condition the average volumetric concentration is having the range from 0 15 to 0 54 in different test cases only the average concentration changes which emphasize the effect of inter particle collisions stokes number remains same for all test cases which is 0 0078 detail flow conditions are shown in table 1 fig 9 presents the relative particle concentration distribution in dense flow through pipes and compares the present model with experimental data of michalik 1973 previous study of kundu and ghoshal 2014 showed that the distance of location of maximum concentration from channel bed increases with increase of average concentration though the mean particle diameter density of particles shear velocity and particle settling velocity remain unchanged from fig 9 it can be observed that the proposed model predicts the location of maximum concentration point quite well further it is observed that the location of maximum concentration gradually approaches to the centerline of the pipe with the increase of average volumetric concentration these data set reflects the validity of model in dense pipe flow and that the parameters α μ and λ 1 changes with mean sediment concentration of the mixture 4 3 applicability in dilute flow through square pipe the data set of wang and ni 1990 is used to verify eq 21 for dilute flow through square pipes the experiments were carried out in a 4 6 cm2 square horizontal pipe using spherical plastic particles with mean diameter d having the range from 0 58 2 29 mm laser doppler anemometry lda was used to measure particle concentrations in these experiments stokes number changes from 0 008 to 0 056 the detail flow characteristics are given in table 1 fig 10 compares the present model with the selected experimental data of wang and ni 1990 from fig 10 it can be observed that the location of maximum concentration point shifts upward with the increase of particle diameter and for fixed particle material density ρ s the comparison results in this figure indicate that present model can be well applied in dilute flow through square pipes to measure type ii profile of particle suspension concentration 4 4 applicability in closed rectangular mixing box flows experimental data of matinpour et al 2019 is chosen to test the validity of proposed model in a rectangular mixing box flow the experiment was done in a rectangular polycarbonate tank of dimensions 0 32 m in cross section 0 40 m high and 0 01 m thick near the bottom of the box an aluminium grid of intersecting mesh of 0 01 m square rods and a mesh of spacing of 0 05 m was placed attached to a stainless steel bar with an eccentric connection to an external electrical motor experiments were performed with different volumetric concentrations of sand 0 3 0 45 0 6 0 9 1 2 and 1 4 the median grain diameter of sand particles was in the range of 0 37 0 4 mm and the density of sand particle was 2650 kg m3 particle image velocimetry piv is used to measure velocities of the fluid and sediment phases the suspended sediment concentration is calculated from the piv images using programme in matlab each sediment laden image is divided into 32 32 pixel windows and then volumetric concentration data were found by identifying sand particle counts in the image fig 11 shows the validation result of the proposed model it can be seen from the figure that proposed model predicts the type ii sand suspension profiles well through the flow depth it can be observed from the figure that the location of maximum concentration shifts towards the channel bottom when mean sand concentration increases and the model predicts that well 4 5 applicability in high concentration fluid mud gravity currents to extend the applicability of the proposed fractional model experiments by jacobson and testik 2013 in a high concentrated fluid mud gravity current is considered in this study apart from these two mentioned profiles in fluid mud gravity current a plume type profile is observed which occurs due to different mechanism and severity of the gravity jacobson and testik 2013 performed experiments in a plexiglas lock exchange tank that is 4 3 m long and 0 25 m wide an aluminium plate that separates the reservoir section from experimental section the plate initially holds the mud in the reservoir section and the water in the experimental section the aluminum lock gate was located 24 5 cm x0 24 5 cm from the wall in backside the mean particle diameter of mud was 0 7 μ m and particle density of 2 62 g cm3 the considered data which shows a plume like profiles are considered and presented in table 1 which as mean flow depth of about 21 to 25 cm fig 12 shows the validity of the present model it can be seen form this figure that not only the model predicts the experimental data well but also it predicts the plume like behavior of the concentration near the channel bottom 5 discussion and dependency of α μ and λ 1 on flow and particle properties previous studies of suspension concentration distribution using space factional advection diffusion by chen et al 2013 kundu 2018 and nie et al 2018 indicates that the fractional order that physically reflects the non local effect is not a constant parameter more precisely chen et al 2013 found that fractional order α depends on particle diameter and turbulent intensity later kundu 2018 has performed an in depth analysis of several experimental data sets from laboratory and field and concluded that the fractional order α also depends on specific gravity settling velocity of particle and shear velocity of the flow conclusion and findings of these studies are considered in this study also as it can be observed from table 1 that fractional order α is not a constant and may depend on flow and particle characteristics and this section shows and analyzes the dependency of the fractional order α and other model parameters μ and λ 1 on several factors this analysis makes the proposed model more easy for application purposes to that end a multivariate regression analysis is carried out to find appropriate functional forms of multiple variable for approximating parameter values apart form this a new artificial neural network ann based model is suggested to find those model parameters in recent years ann based approaches to approximate functions and to find hidden non linear relations between input and output has exponentially increased ann modelling has been applied in several fields of water resources engineering by asce task committee application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000a application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000b samani et al 2007 sahu et al 2011 to the best of author s knowledge this methodology has not been applied or proposed in modelling of different types of suspension distribution with including the effects of non locality with large number of data sets considered in this study this study proposes a ann based solution of parameter estimation problem these are discussed in the following subsections 5 1 method 1 regression analysis model fig 13 shows the variation of model parameters α μ and λ 1 with dimensionless particle diameter d settling velocity of particle ω 0 δ p and average concentration c c 100 the dimensionless particle diameter d is defined as d d s p 1 g ν f 2 1 3 in which s p ρ s ρ f is the specific gravity of particle ν f μ f ρ f is the kinematic viscosity of fluid μ f is viscosity of fluid and ρ f is density of fluid the parameter δ p is defined as s p 1 one can easily fit polynomials of certain degree to get an estimation of these parameters with respect each of these parameters but these results indicate that the parameters significantly depend on all these variables and therefore a multivariate relation would be more appropriate and reasonable to predict these parameters to predict the nature of α μ and λ 1 with those flow and particle properties a multivariate nonlinear regression analysis is carries out with total 49 number of values including all test cases from regression analysis the following relation are found suitable 26 α 2 4 2 9 d 0 1 0 0002 δ p 1 4 0 5 ω 0 u 1 95 5 4 c 0 004 9 5 0 3 d 0 29 9 13 δ p 0 0016 0 5 ω 0 u 1 88 0 0014 c 1 34 27 μ 2 41 4 23 d 0 22 263 94 δ p 7 11 0 214 ω 0 u 1 975 7 04 c 2 98 18 81 14 09 d 0 05 223 49 δ p 6 96 6 45 ω 0 u 0 021 6 77 c 2 981 and 28 λ 1 18 64 103 19 d 1 98 4 6 10 5 δ p 4 47 100 59 ω 0 u 4 8 10 64 c 1 24 2 7 0 04 d 3 44 1 1 10 6 δ p 4 54 9 08 ω 0 u 4 84 21 19 c 0 82 the computed values from the regression relation in eqs 26 28 are compared against the fitted values of all three parameters and results are plotted in figs 14 a 15 a and 16 a the value of the coefficient of regression r 2 are obtained as 0 85 0 9 and 0 87 for α μ and λ 1 respectively the residuals or error of the proposed nonlinear regression model is also shown in these figs 14 b 15 b and 16 b as histograms these figures show that it follows a normal density distribution which indicates that the proposed assumptions are appropriate eqs 26 28 can be applied to choose the order of the fractional power and other parameters when suspension distributions of different types are modeled using the fractional kinetic models from the validation results and experimental data it is found that the pattern of the suspension profile depends on the particle density or in other words on parameter δ p of particle the density of particle ranges from 1 006 gm cm3 to 2 65 gm cm3 for all experimental data considered due to the change in particle density settling velocity of particle also changes which further affects the underlying mixing process effects of particle density in terms of δ p on the suspension profiles are presented in fig 17 for two types of suspension profile namely type ii fig 17 and plume like fig 17 b the effects of particle density on other types of profiles can be obtained in a similar manner in the figure five different possible values of δ p are considered as 0 5 1 0 1 3 1 65 and 1 8 the values of other parameters are taken as η a 0 01 d 0 35 mm u 0 05 m s c 4 since with the change in δ p or particle density settling velocity also changes all the curves in fig 17 are plotted in the following manner first the value of δ p is chosen then settling velocity is calculated form the formula proposed by zhiyao et al 2008 as 29 ω 0 ν f d d 3 38 1 0 93 d 12 7 7 8 since values of fractional order α and other parameters μ and λ 1 depends on all these parameters then their values are computed from the proposed formulae in eqs 26 28 after computing all these parameters the suspension profile is computed from eq 21 in fig 17 b μ 1 01 is assumed for showing the result for plume like profile and other parameters α and λ 1 are computed form eqs 26 and 28 respectively from the results in both the cases figures it is found that suspension profile appears as uniform profile when δ p is small as the case for δ p 0 5 with the increase of δ p suspension profile becomes more non uniform this result can be explained as follows smaller values of δ p indicate lighter particle and when δ p increases particle becomes heavier light particles are easily transported by turbulent fluctuation against gravity than heavy particles apart form it by the turbulent bursting effect light particles jump larger distances compared to heavy particles due to these reasons mixing of lighter particles becomes highly non local processes and as a result suspension profile become more uniform whereas in case of heavy particles though non local mixing occurs but still may be limited to certain distances which results a more non uniform distributions these obtained results are in consistent with the experimental observations considered in this study 5 2 method 2 artificial neural network model in recent years artificial neural networks ann is regarded as one of the good modelling methods where there is a non linear relationship between input and output parameters also it is capable of predicting multivariate regression models well it is clear from the above section that fractional order α and other parameters μ and λ 1 show a non linear relationship with particle and flow properties such as particle diameter the density of the particle settling velocity shear velocity of flow and mean concentration in this section we propose an artificial neural network based modelling approach to predict those parameters with more high accuracy an ann is comprised of three layers input layer hidden layer and output layer every layer contains a certain number of neurons neurons in input and output layers receive data and give output respectively in the hidden layer neurons perform the data processing task with the help of weights and contact with other neurons these three layers form a network structure to get the solution from the given inputs according to ripley 1996 most of the functions can be well approximated using a single hidden layer therefore in this study we have chosen a single hidden layer neural network which is also known as shallow nn a schematic diagram is presented in fig 18 for all the three parameters as mentioned above from the above regression result it shows that all the model parameters depend on four variables namely dimensionless particle diameter d specific gravity δ p 1 dimensionless settling velocity ω u and average concentration c we consider these four quantities as an input variable and assume that 30 θ α μ λ 1 f d δ p ω u c where c c 10 2 the input layer takes the input of these four variables mentioned inside the functional symbol on the rhs of eq 30 and the output layer gives the output parameter as α or μ or λ 1 three layer feed forward back propagation network is designed using the neural net fitting toolbox of the matlab version r2020a in the hidden layer 25 neurons are considered total 49 data sets consisting of 196 data points are used to training validating and testing the nn for the training levenberg marquardt s back propagation training algorithm is used for parameter μ due to its high nonlinearity and scaled conjugate gradient algorithm is used for the parameters α and λ 1 which gives good results the mean squared error mse error and r 2 are chosen to find the performance of the models the total considered data set is randomly partitioned by the build in algorithm of matlab for training validation and testing with the ratio for training and testing validation as 70 and 30 respectively in the case of parameter μ 80 of the data set has been used for training and 20 data is utilized for validation and testing each fig 19 shows the summary of the performance achieved by the considered nn training tool along with an error histogram associated with the trained network for all three parameters first second and third rows in fig 19 are the results corresponding to the parameters α μ and λ 1 respectively the training algorithm divides the data set as mentioned earlier for training validation and testing purpose the scaled conjugate gradient and levenberg marquardt s algorithms with enabled backpropagation is then iterates with a maximum 1000 number of training epochs until the mse error achieves a minimum it can be seen from the figure that 20 37 and 22 epochs are sufficient to achieve the minimum error for parameters α μ and λ 1 respectively it can be observed from figs 19 a 19 c and 19 e that the difference of errors in testing and cross validation is within the reasonable limit for all three parameters which indicate the good performance of the nn to get the overall idea of the performance of the constructed nn comparison results between computed and target actual parameter values in table 1 are plotted for training validation testing and overall performance from fig 20 to fig 22 for three parameters in all figures a c indicates the comparison for training validation and testing respectively and d indicates the overall comparisons the r value in the figure indicates the r 2 value of fitting the overall r 2 values for the parameters α μ and λ 1 are 0 929 0 895 and 0 9096 respectively it can be observed that the higher r 2 values are obtained for all the parameters than the previous regression method these results indicate that the proposed nn based approach is much more efficient for predicting the values of the parameters it can be noted that the efficiency of this nn can be improved if more data sets are included 6 conclusions this study investigates the effects of non locality on the structure of suspension distribution of particles from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint the study starts with the fractional liouville equation and derived a fractional kinetic equation that includes the effect of non locality through space fractional caputo derivative the proposed governing equation is solved analytically and a simple analytical solution is obtained the model predicts four different types of profiles that occur in several real world turbulent transportation problems the following conclusions can are obtained see fig 21 1 the proposed solution of the fractional kinetic model is validated with large numbers of experimental data of different types validation results show that the model can be applied in dilute and dense flows through open channels and pipes to predict the waste materials in slurry pipelines and to predict the density of mud in a gravity mud flow it can also be concluded that the fractional kinetic model is more appropriate than standard kinetic equations 2 unlike the previous study the present model is validated for both sand and plastic particles it has been found that the model can be applied equally and gives good results for both types of particles 3 the proposed model contains two major parameters α the fractional order parameter and μ shape parameters parameter α physically signifies the underlying mixing process and μ constructs the shape of the profile physically α 1 signifies a subdiffusion process and α 1 shows a super diffusion process it is found that type i profiles are associated with the subdiffusion process whereas the other three types are associate with the superdiffusion process more precisely α 1 and μ 1 gives type i profile and α 1 and μ 1 shows other types of profiles 4 from the results of validations it is found that parameters α and μ depend on particle diameter the density of particles settling velocity of particle shear flow velocity and mean concentration of the flow mathematical models are proposed from regression analysis to calculate the values of these parameters further to increase the prediction accuracy of the models model parameters are estimated using ann models the ann models show better results than regression models and hence can be considered as an effective alternative to investigate model parameters this study is primarily focused to investigate the effects of non local mixing for different patterns of concentration distribution the solution in terms of the mittag leffler function is obtained from the proposed fractional kinetic model in this study uses the laplace transformation method and initial assumption of the dilute flow concentration model which is considered as a power function and thus give a limitation of it apart from it the restrictions of laplace transformation are also to be followed in the future the proposed solution can be improved by considering different types of dilute concentration distribution e g exponential type rouse type and others and using other general solution methodology apart from it another improvement can also be done by considering other general forms of fractional kinetic models credit authorship contribution statement snehasis kundu

4241,soil water in an unsaturated zone is the major source of groundwater recharge and likewise soil contaminants are the major source of groundwater contamination it is thus essential to jointly consider soil water movement and solute transport together with groundwater movement and solute transport which is particularly important when addressing regional scale problems this study developed a new quasi 3 d model for simulating regional scale saturated unsaturated water movement and solute transport in arid and semi arid agricultural areas the unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport processes are simulated by a 1 d soil water and solute transport model referred to as ubmod and the saturated groundwater movement and solute transport are simulated by modflow and mt3dms in the quasi 3 d model the soil water movement and groundwater movement modules are iteratively coupled and the soil solute transport and groundwater solute transport modules are iteratively couple this is referred to as a dual iterative coupling scheme strength and weakness of the quasi 3 d model and the coupling scheme were evaluated with two synthetic cases and a real world application results indicate satisfactory performance of the model which demonstrates the reliability of the dual iterative coupling scheme besides the impacts of spatial and temporal discretization and stress period on model stability and accuracy has been evaluated and the model is more computationally efficient than the fully numerical methods based on richards equation when the problem is a 2d 3d problem with a scale larger than 10 m moreover the application to the hetao irrigation district indicates that the developed model is effective and efficient for the real world regional scale agricultural problems above all it is concluded that the new model is more suitable than existing models for simulating regional scale unsaturated saturated soil water movement and solute transport in arid and semi arid agricultural areas keywords regional scale problems quasi three dimensional model unsaturated saturated water movement and solute transport dual iterative coupling scheme 1 introduction soil solutes in the unsaturated zone are major sources of groundwater contamination yang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 it is thus essential to jointly consider unsaturated solute transport together with saturated solute transport this is particularly true when addressing regional scale problems such as groundwater exploitation and protection soil salinization non point source contamination du et al 2020 rumynin et al 2020 liu et al 2020 shokri kuehni et al 2020 tian et al 2012 various numerical models have been developed in the last several decades to simulate the processes involved in regional scale saturated unsaturated solute transport many models are based on fully three dimensional 3 d schemes such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2012 feflow diersch 2013 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 and parflow maxwell et al 2009 which numerically solve the 3 d richards equation and advection dispersion equation while these models are physically based and mathematically rigorous they are challenged by the incompatible spatial and temporal scales of various hydrological processes in the unsaturated and saturated zones beegum et al 2019 specifically speaking the spatial and temporal discretization of the unsaturated zone has to be fine enough e g centimeter in length and second in time because of the highly nonlinear relationships between the soil water content θ the pressure head h and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ and the influence of drastic fluctuations of the atmospheric boundary zha et al 2019 farthing and ogden 2017 downer and ogden 2004 the spatial and temporal discretization for the saturated zone can be coarser with the spatial step size ranging from a few meters to several kilometers and the temporal step size ranging from days to months because the saturated flow is less nonlinear than the unsaturated flow as a result the numerical solutions of the fully 3 d models may be difficult to converge and computationally expensive for regional scale problems shen and phanikumar 2010 the simplified schemes have been introduced based on the characteristics of the regional scale problems such as the quasi 3 d scheme which ignores lateral flows in the unsaturated zone and describes the soil water movement and solute transport as one dimensional 1 d processes in the vertical direction but still treats the groundwater movement and solute transport as 3 d processes beegum et al 2019 kuznetsov et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 ranatunga et al 2008 the scheme has been widely used for regional scale saturated unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport problems zhang et al 2020 beegum et al 2020 mao et al 2019 szymkiewicz et al 2018 beegum et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 morway et al 2013 yakirevich et al 2013 xu et al 2012 kuznetsov et al 2012 shen and phanikumar 2010 markstrom et al 2008 twarakavi et al 2008 seo et al 2007 niswonger et al 2006 stoppelenburg et al 2005 this study used the quasi 3 d scheme for tackling unsaturated saturated soil salt transport problems in regional scale arid and semi arid agricultural areas which has been received extensive attention in recent years daliakopoulos et al 2016 assouline et al 2015 however there are still some issues to consider the first one is the level of coupling the saturated and unsaturated modules based on their levels of coupling the quasi 3 d models can be classified into three different kinds i e uncoupled iteratively coupled and fully coupled models furman 2008 for uncoupled models during each time step of numerical simulation one module usually the unsaturated module is firstly solved based on the defined interface boundary conditions usually the results of the previous time step then the interface boundary conditions are updated and the other module is solved the uncoupled models are easy to implement and thus widely used in computer codes such as uzf modflow mt3dms morway et al 2013 uzf modflow rt3d bailey et al 2013 pht3d uzf wu et al 2016 and hydrus modflow mt3dms beegum et al 2019 however the one way information passing and no feedback calculation may result in mass balance errors shen and phanikumar 2010 the iteratively coupled models differ from the uncouple models in that the former models re run the first module with the updated interface boundary conditions until convergence criteria are achieved which increases model accuracy but also increases computational cost the iteratively coupled scheme have also been widely used for saturated unsaturated water flow problems mao et al 2019 kuznetsov et al 2012 stoppelenburg et al 2005 liang et al 2003 yakirevich et al 1998 and the scheme has been further extended to saturated unsaturated solute transport problems fully coupled models are mathematically and computationally rigorous as they solve the unsaturated module the saturated module and the interface boundary conditions simultaneously zhu et al 2013 however the fully coupled models are computationally expensive and difficult to implement due to the frequent interactions between the saturated zone and unsaturated zone caused by significant evapotranspiration and intensive irrigation in arid and semi arid agricultural areas a new iterative coupling scheme has been developed to simulate the regional scale salt transport problems in addition to the choice of the level of coupling another practical issue is how to link the water movement and solute transport modules the solute transport module based on the eulerian method may suffer from numerical dispersion and artificial oscillation and they may be controlled by using peclet number and courant number to ensure numerical stability and accuracy of the solute transport module a common practice is to reduce the size of time steps zheng and wang 1999 which may lead to a mismatch between the time steps of flow simulation and the time steps of the solute transport simulation it is conventional to further discretize the water movement time steps into the solute transport time steps and to assume a constant flow rate during the solute transport time steps as mt3dms does however the unsaturated soil water movement and salt transport changes drastically especially near the soil surface the mismatch of time steps may cause a non negligible deviation for the unsaturated zone therefore an adaptive time step linking scheme between the unsaturated soil water movement and the solute transport has been used to improve computational accuracy for the practical agricultural problems in this study the last issue is about the difficulties of describing the solute transport processes under practical conditions very fine spatial and temporal discretization and intensive input data and model parameters are required when solving the hydraulic processes in the unsaturated zone visconti et al 2011 which are not always available in regional scale problems moreover the advection dispersion equation is inadequate to describe significantly anomalous transport phenomena e g preferential and non equilibrium solute transport which has been observed in practice because of the strong heterogeneity of the porous media sternagel et al 2019 to alleviate the numerical difficulties several simplified approaches have been used such as the kinematic wave equation adopted by the uzf modflow mt3dms method and the tipping bucket method kendy et al 2003 however both the approaches ignore the matric potential the upward soil water movement driven by the matric potential is important because soil salts accumulate near the soil surface due to the significant evapotranspiration in arid and semi arid agricultural areas in addition the significant anomalous transport phenomenon is not adequately described in the two approaches to overcome these deficiencies mao et al 2018 2020 developed a new model to simulate unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport based on the mass conservation principle the soil water movement module considers all the driven forces i e the gravitational potential the matric potential and external forces that impact the soil water movement and can simulate both upward and downward soil water movement in heterogeneous soils the solute transport module adopts the mobile immobile assumption to describe the significant anomalous transport phenomenon the model is efficient and has satisfactory performance for coarse spatial and temporal discretization which make it suitable for regional scale modeling this study developed a new quasi 3 d model for simulating regional scale saturated unsaturated solute transport problems in arid and semi arid agricultural areas the unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport processes are described by the 1 d soil water and solute transport model referred to as ubmod mao et al 2018 2020 and the saturated groundwater movement and solute transport processes are described by modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 because the soil water movement and groundwater movement modules are iteratively coupled and the soil solute transport and groundwater solute transport modules are also iteratively coupled our method is referred to as the dual iterative coupling scheme the objectives of this study are to 1 introduce the methodology of the new quasi 3 d water movement and solute transport model and 2 evaluate the strength and weakness of the developed model under synthetic and real world conditions 2 methodology and model development the quasi 3 d scheme has been adopted to develop the new model in particular the unsaturated zone is divided into several subregions based on their similar characteristics elevation soil types land usage crop types and only the vertical unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport processes within a subregion are considered while the horizontal heterogeneity in each subregion is ignored on the contrary the saturated groundwater movement and solute transport processes are treated as 3 d processes the new model can be composed by several modules in this section the 1 d soil water movement module the soil solute transport module the groundwater movement module and the groundwater solute transport module are first introduced in sequence in sect 2 1 and sect 2 2 since the modules are already published they are only briefly described afterward the relationship of these modules is described in sect 2 3 and the calculation procedures of the dual iterative coupling scheme is elaborated in sect 2 4 2 1 1 d soil water movement and solute transport modules the 1 d soil water movement and solute transport modules are based on ubmod which are based on the principle of mass conservation and has been published in mao et al 2020 2018 in this study these modules considering the lower boundary of the groundwater table and the water and solute exchange between saturated zone and unsaturated zone have been added comparing to the original version more details would be found in the appendix for the soil water three driven forces i e the gravitational potential the matric potential and external forces are considered to impact soil water movement and there are totally five calculation steps during each time step of the simulation as shown in fig 1 a firstly the spatial discretization of the unsaturated zone is adjusted to ensure all the soil layers are above the groundwater table while a virtual layer is added under the groundwater table for the calculation of groundwater consumption then the allocation of the infiltration is applied moreover the soil water movement driven by gravitational potential external forces and matric potential are calculated the detailed introduction and governing equations can be found in mao et al 2018 the flux across the groundwater table can be obtained and is referred to as the groundwater recharge for the solute the mobile immobile assumption is adopted to describe the significant anomalous transport phenomenon observed in practice and the soil water content θ is separated into the soil water content θm in the mobile region and the soil water content θim in the immobile region for a specific layer the solute advective process the chemical reaction process the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions and the solute dispersive process are considered in the mobile region while only the chemical reaction process and the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions are considered in the immobile region as shown in fig 1 b the specific governing equations are presented in mao et al 2020 2 2 groundwater movement and salt transport modules modflow is used to describe the groundwater movement process which is a three dimensional block centered finite difference groundwater model developed by usgs and is the most widely used computer code for groundwater modeling the governing equation solved by modflow is 1 x i k ii h x i w s s s h t where

sink term of groundwater t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 mt3dms is used to describe the groundwater solute transport process which is developed for using with any block centered finite difference flow model such as modflow the model has comprehensive capabilities for simulating advection dispersion and chemical reactions of solute transport in a groundwater aquifer zheng and wang 1999 the governing equation solved by mt3dms is 2 ϕ c t x i ϕ d ij c x j x i ϕ v g i c w s c s r n where ϕ indicates the porosity for the saturated porous media l3l 3 c is the dissolved

mt3dms are linked via a flow transport link file which involves the saturated thickness fluxes across cell interfaces in all directions and locations and flow rates of various source sink terms calculated by the groundwater model flopy bakker et al 2016 is a python package for creating running and post processing modflow based models and has been used to run modflow and mt3dms 2 3 spatial and temporal coupling scheme of different modules the regional scale saturated unsaturated water movement and solute transport processes have been divided into four modules i e the unsaturated soil water movement module the saturated groundwater movement module the unsaturated soil solute transport module and the saturated solute transport module and the specific calculation procedures within each module are described above the links between different modules are shown in fig 2 a and the temporal coupling methods between different modules are shown in fig 2 b the simulation period is divided into a series of stress period δt which has been used to specify the stress data of saturated modules and the exchange information of the iterative coupling each module has its own time step and the time step of the unsaturated soil water movement module and the solute transport module is denoted as δtu while the time steps of the saturated groundwater movement module and the solute transport module are denoted as δtsw and δtss respectively during each stress period in the calculations the unsaturated soil water movement module and the saturated groundwater movement module are iteratively coupled via the groundwater recharge r and the groundwater table depth g d specifically the unsaturated soil water movement module runs with the groundwater table as the lower boundary condition and calculates the groundwater recharge during the stress period the saturated groundwater movement module runs with the groundwater recharge and calculates the groundwater table depth the procedures will be repeated until the convergence criterion is met the water movement results calculated by the unsaturated soil water movement module and the saturated groundwater movement module are saved for solute transport modules the saturated solute transport module will discretize the groundwater movement time steps into shorter parts and keep the groundwater flow rate stable when there is a mismatch between the saturated water movement adopted time steps and the saturated solute transport needed time steps however the unsaturated modules will rerun the unsaturated soil water movement module with a decreased time step until the match between the soil water movement time step and soil solute transport time step which is referred to as an adaptive time step linking scheme the courant number cr is used to estimate the suitable time step additionally the unsaturated solute transport module and the saturated solute transport module are iteratively coupled via the groundwater recharge concentration c r and the shallow groundwater concentration c g specifically the unsaturated solute transport module adopts the shallow groundwater concentration c g as the lower boundary condition of the unsaturated zone while the saturated solute transport module adopts the concentration of groundwater recharge c r as the upper boundary condition the iterative procedures will also be repeated until the convergence criterion is met 2 4 calculation procedures of the developed model the specific flow chart of the dual iterative coupling scheme during one stress period is shown in fig 3 the simulation time of the stress period is from t to t δt and the variables calculated in this stress period are denoted by the superscript t assume that l subregions are used for the study area and the saturated zone is divided into m rows n columns and k layers the initial groundwater table depth and the shallow groundwater concentration of the stress period are g d t 1 and c d t 1 m n dimension which are the results calculated during the previous stress period the calculation procedures are as follows a assuming that the water movement iteration level is p and the groundwater table depth g d t p 1 is the result calculated during the previous iteration level when the model runs at the first level of iteration the result calculated during the previous iteration level p 0 is equal to g d t 1 the l th subregion is chosen as an example and the area of the subregion is sl l2 the unsaturated zone depth is equal to the groundwater table depth and the average depth is calculated as 3 m u l t p s l g d t p 1 d s s l g d t 1 d s 2 s l where m u l t p indicates the averaged unsaturated zone depth of the l th subregion during the t stress period and the p th iteration l the equation means that the unsaturated zone depth during the p th iteration of the l th subregion is the average value in time and space of the groundwater table depth calculated during the p 1th iteration of the stress period similarly the unsaturated zone depths for all subregions can be obtained and are denoted as m u t p l dimension b the model runs the unsaturated soil water movement module with the time step δtu from t to t δt the soil water flux vu the soil water content and various source sink terms calculated by the unsaturated soil water movement module are stored c the courant number is calculated if the courant number exceeds 1 the calculation time step will be decreased and the soil water movement module will be rerun with the adjusted time step until the criterion cr 1 is satisfied d the average groundwater recharge rate r for all time steps of the l th subregion from t to t δt can be obtained by 4 r t t δ t r δ t where r indicates the groundwater recharge rate l then the average groundwater recharge rate matrix for the entire area can be obtained represented as r t p m n dimension by assigning each value calculated by the soil columns to the corresponding finite difference grids e the groundwater recharge rate r t p is transferred to the saturated groundwater movement module and is used in the rch package of modflow the developed model then runs modflow with the time step δtsw to obtain the saturated hydraulic head and the groundwater table depth at the end of the stress period which are marked as h t p and g d t p f the convergence of water movement modules is determined based on the following two criteria 5 max h t p h t p 1 ε w 6 max g d t p g d t p 1 ε w where εw is the tolerance error of the water coupling processes l which is defined by the users if the criteria are met the iteration of water movement modules stops and h t p and g d t p are the convergent results for the stress period otherwise the iteration continues to the p 1th calculation until the convergence criteria are met g assume that the solute transport iteration level is q and the shallow groundwater concentration calculated during the previous iteration level is c d t q 1 m n dimension the lower boundary condition of the l th subregion used for the unsaturated solute transport module is 7 c d l t q s l c d t q 1 d s s l c d t 1 d s 2 s l where c d l t q indicates the lower concentration boundary of the unsaturated zone for the l th subregion ml 3 the equation means that the lower concentration boundary of the unsaturated zone during the q th iteration of the l th subregion is the average value in time and space of the shallow groundwater concentration calculated during the q 1th iteration of the stress period the lower concentration boundaries of the unsaturated zone for all subregions are denoted as c d t q l dimension h the developed model runs the unsaturated solute transport module with the time step δtu from t to t δt the groundwater recharge concentration can be obtained which is converted to an m n dimensional matrix and denoted as c r t q i the groundwater recharge concentration c r t q is transferred to the saturated solute transport module and mt3dms runs with the upper boundary condition to obtain the solute distribution j the convergence of the solute transport modules is determined based on the following two criteria 8 max c d t q c d t q 1 ε s 9 max c r t q c r t q 1 ε s where εs is the tolerance error of the solute coupling processes ml 3 if the criteria are met the calculation procedures for this stress period ended otherwise the iteration continues to the q 1th calculation until the convergence criteria are met the model was implemented by a hybrid programming method of python and fortran the pre processing post processing and control of the calculation procedures were developed by python scripts considering its large number of extension libraries for scientific analysis and geospatial data computation while the saturated and unsaturated water movement and solute transport processes were calculated by fortran considering its excellent computational efficiency the fortran codes for unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport were compiled into a python package and the flopy package was used to run the saturated groundwater and solute transport modules 3 model evaluation in this section two synthetic cases and a real world application were designed to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the developed model the simulation results of the two synthetic cases were compared with the results obtained by hydrus 1d and swms 2d and those of the real world application are compared with field observations and experiments the comparison results were quantified using the mean absolute relative error mre the root mean squared error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the determination coefficient r 2 which are defined as 10 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 12 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 13 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where the subscript i indicates the serial number of the results n indicates the total number of the results yi indicates the simulated result yi indicates the reference result y is the averaged simulated result and y is the averaged reference result 3 1 case 1 1 d soil salt transport this case was used to test the performance of the dual iterative coupling scheme under complicated upper boundary conditions and heterogeneous situations the case considers 1 d soil water movement and salt transport in a field profile of the hupselse beek watershed in the netherlands which was used as a demo in the hydrus 1d technical manual šimůnek et al 2013 in this case soil salt has a pronounced accumulation near the soil surface the simulation results calculated by hydrus 1d were used as the reference values scenarios with different spatial and temporal discretization of the unsaturated modules and different stress period were used for the model evaluation the depth of the profile is 2 3 m and the profile consists of a 0 4 m thick upper layer and a 1 9 m thick bottom layer the top of the profile is covered by grass and the depth of the root zone is 0 3 m the upper boundary condition containing the precipitation and the actual transpiration rates is presented in fig 4 the lower boundary condition is a prescribed drainage condition the groundwater table depth was initially set at 0 55 m below the surface and the initial salt concentration for the whole profile was a constant and set as 10 g l the simulation time is 183 days from april 1 to september 30 the soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 1 twelve scenarios were set in this case which were used to evaluate the influence of the spatial and temporal discretization as well as the stress period on performance of the developed model the details of the scenarios are listed in table 2 the comparison between the groundwater levels calculated by the developed model and those simulated by hydurs 1d for scenario 1a are shown in fig 5 a the figure shows that the results given by the developed model are consistent with the hydrus 1d results the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the groundwater level are 9 1 0 11 m 0 953 and 0 994 respectively the comparison of the soil water content and the salt concentration of the observation point at the depth of 0 15 m for scenario 1a are shown in fig 5 b and fig 5 c respectively the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the soil water content at the depth of 0 15 m are 4 1 0 014 cm3 cm3 0 881 and 0 930 respectively while the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the salt concentration at the depth of 0 15 m are 6 7 2 29 g l 0 975 and 0 980 respectively the comparison of soil water content profiles and salt concentration profiles at different times for scenario 1a are shown in fig 5 d and fig 5 e the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the soil water content profiles are 2 5 4 6 0 009 cm3 cm3 0 014 cm3 cm3 0 971 0 979 and 0 915 0 943 respectively the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the salt concentration profiles are 3 2 3 5 1 84 g l 1 33 g l 0 937 0 979 and 0 948 0 980 respectively the values calculated by the developed model fit the reference values well moreover the statistical index values of the soil salt concentration at the depth of 0 15 m and salt concentration profiles at the ending time for different scenarios are listed in table 3 all mre values are smaller than 15 and r 2 values are bigger than 0 90 it can be concluded that the values calculated by the developed model for all scenarios fit the reference values therefore the calculation results indicate a satisfactory performance of the developed model moreover the salt transport results with different spatial and temporal discretization of the unsaturated modules and different stress period were compared and the results of the salt concentration of the observation point at the depth of 0 15 m and salt concentration profiles at the ending time are shown in fig 6 scenarios 1a 1b and 1c have different calculation time steps while scenarios 1b 1e and 1h have different spatial steps and scenarios 1a and 1 j have different stress period the statistical index values of the salt concentration at the depth of 0 15 m and salt concentration profiles at the ending time are shown in table 3 for the scenarios with different time steps such as 1a 1b and 1c it can be found that the quantitative differences of mre values and r 2 values for the soil salt content at the depth of 0 15 m and the salt concentration profiles at the ending time for different scenarios are all smaller than 1 0 and 0 01 respectively for the scenarios with different stress period such as 1a and 1 j the quantitative differences of mre values and r 2 values for results of different scenarios are smaller than 1 0 and 0 01 respectively for the scenarios with different spatial steps such as 1b 1e and 1h the quantitative differences of mre values and r 2 values for results of different scenarios are close to 5 0 and 0 04 which are larger than the previous values and obvious inconsistence can be found in fig 6 b when comparing with fig 6 a and fig 6 c the results indicate that the difference of results calculated by the developed model with different time steps and stress period was little while the difference of results calculated by the developed model with different spatial steps was obvious the reason is the effect of the numerical dispersion which is caused by the truncation error therefore the scenario with coarse spatial discretization may lead to smoother values instead of the fluctuations and extreme values performed with finer discretization the developed model was run on a personal computer with the cpu of amd ryzen 7 3700x 8 core processor and 32 g memory the computation times of different scenarios are shown in table 2 the computation time of hydrus 1d is 0 7 s while the computation times of the developed model range from 9 s to 18 s the developed model takes longer computation time than hydrus 1d in the one dimensional case because of the complicated iterative coupling 3 2 case 2 2 d solute transport case with the steady soil water movement condition this case considered a 2 d soil water movement and solute transport problem and the purpose of the case is to estimate the limitations of the quasi 3 d scheme the modeling domain is a 10 m 5 m rectangular vertical plane as shown in fig 7 a the initial groundwater level was 2 m a constant flux q was applied at the top of the domain the bottom layer was a no flux boundary and the hydraulic head at the left and right boundaries were fixed a constant solute boundary condition was applied at the surface from x 4 m to x 6 m and the concentration was 1 g l the soil type in the domain is loam and hydraulic parameters adopted in this case are listed in table 1 the results simulated by swms 2d were used as the reference values and the simulation domain was divided into 5151 finite element nodes for the calculation of swms 2d for the developed model ten equal size subregions are used to represent the unsaturated zone the spatial discretization adopted by the unsaturated modules and the saturated modules of the developed model is 0 1 m five scenarios with different longitudinal dispersivity dl and different transverse dispersivity dt were set in this case the parameters used by different scenarios are listed in table 4 the groundwater level and solute concentration results of scenario 2a calculated by swms 2d and the developed model are shown in fig 7 b it can be found that the solute calculated by swms 2d moves farther in the x direction while the solute calculated by the developed model are more likely to move downwards in the z direction the reason is that due to the obstruction of the lower boundary the groundwater between x 4 m and x 6 m remains almost static in swms 2d results meanwhile there are obvious lateral soil water movement near the groundwater level which leads to the obvious solute transport in the x direction however the developed model calculates the water movement in the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone separately and ignores the lateral soil water movement in the unsaturated zone therefore the groundwater is vertically recharged in the developed model which leads to the downward water movement and solute transport in the z direction in the region under groundwater level between x 4 m and x 6 m above all the rmse nse and r 2 values for the solute concentration are 0 099 g l 0 890 and 0 895 respectively the results calculated by the developed model show a similar changing trend to those of swms 2d although the quasi 3 d assumption which ignoring the lateral soil water movement leads to systematic errors moreover the results calculated by swms 2d and the developed model of the different scenarios are shown in fig 7 b and the scenarios 2a 2b and 2c have different longitudinal dispersivity dl while the scenarios 2a 2d and 2e have different transverse dispersivity dt the statistical index values of different scenarios are listed in table 4 for scenarios 2a 2b and 2c the rmse values range from 0 099 g l to 0 118 g l and the nse values range from 0 857 to 0 890 and the r 2 values range from 0 861 to 0 894 it can be found that the statistical index values change slightly when different values of longitudinal dispersivity are taken besides the better results can be obtained with a larger longitudinal dispersivity moreover for scenarios 2a 2d and 2e the rmse values range from 0 099 g l to 0 105 g l and the nse values range from 0 834 to 0 890 and the r 2 values range from 0 868 to 0 894 it can be found that the better results correspond to a lower transverse dispersivity the major calculation errors of the developed model for this case are caused by ignoring the lateral soil water movement and solute transport in the unsaturated zone for all scenarios the rmse values of the developed model are smaller than 0 12 g l the nse values are bigger than 0 83 and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 86 the calculation results are acceptable the computation times of different scenarios are shown in table 4 the computation times of the developed model range from 5 s to 6 s while the computation time of swms 2d range from 10 s to 11 s it can be concluded that the computation efficiency of the developed model is 2 times faster than swms 2d in this case considering the results of case 1 it is anticipated that the developed model is more efficient with complicated larger scale problems 3 3 case 3 regional scale salt transport problem in hetao irrigation district in real world regional scale agricultural areas the lateral hydraulic gradient and the transverse dispersivity are usually significantly small therefore considering the characteristic of the hydrological cycle processes and the computational efficiency the quasi 3 d assumption for the regional scale arid and semi arid agricultural areas is more physically reasonable and computationally efficient 3 3 1 study site and input data in this case the developed model was applied to the hetao irrigation district which is a representative agricultural area in arid and semi arid regions with problems of salinization and improper water use fig 8 a shows the location of the specific study site the longsheng irrigation area 107 27 22 8 107 32 40 3 e 40 49 15 9 40 55 25 4 n which belongs to hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china the study site is 11 6 km long from north to south and 7 km wide from east to west and the area of the study site is 37 88 km2 the study site is surrounded by irrigation canals and drainage ditches the major part of the study area was irrigated by surface water from the xiji branch canal which was diverted from the yellow river while the southwestern part of the study site was irrigated by groundwater the study site was divided into 17 subregions based on the distribution of field canals in the study site which were shown in fig 8 b the surface elevation decreases from 1037 9 m to 1035 8 m which is shown in fig 8 c geological survey has been carried out by the regulation agencies and the distribution of the boreholes near the study site is shown in fig 8 d six boreholes are connected into two geological sections near the study site which are referred to as ⅰ ⅱ and iii ⅳ the vertical soil type distributions of the boreholes are shown in fig 8 f the study site is underlain by lake sediments and alluvial deposits from the yellow river and a mud clay layer is found below q3 stratum which is considered as the impervious layer the zone above the impervious layer is considered to be the unconfined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer is composed of q4 stratum and q3 stratum as shown in fig 2 f the upper layer of the q4 stratum has a lower permeability and is primarily loam with a thickness between 4 2 m and 7 2 m the bottom layer of the q4 stratum and q3 stratum has a relatively high permeability and is primarily sand with a thickness between 108 6 m and 131 4 m seven boreholes with pumping test around the study site were used to obtain the horizontal hydraulic conductivities and the results are shown in fig 8 e the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the bottom layer range from 13 46 m d to 17 81 m d and the average value is 15 33 m d for the upper layer of the study area near the ground surface the horizontal hydraulic conductivities range from 2 20 m d to 2 91 m d based on soil type composed primarily by loam mao et al 2017 and the average value is 2 50 m d due to the special climate crops in the study area are planted for only one time from may to september per year and an intensive irrigation called autumn irrigation is applied for soil salt leaching during october the rest seasons of the year are cold and dry and the land is fallow the regional scale water and salt transport processes were observed during the crop growth period in 2018 there were 5 groundwater observation wells and the distribution of the wells can be found in fig 8 a the groundwater table depths were observed 3 times every month from may to october the groundwater concentrations were observed during the first week of may besides 41 soil water and salt observation points were set within the study area as shown in fig 8 c the soil water contents and soil salt were measured every 20 cm in a vertical direction at each observation point before and after the crop growth period the reference evapotranspiration et 0 precipitation p and irrigation i in 2018 are shown in fig 9 the meteorological data were obtained from a weather station 10 km away from the study site and the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration et 0 the simulation period was set from may 1 2018 to october 31 2018 and a warm up period of 30 days was adopted the saturated zone of the test area was divided horizontally into 150 100 finite difference grids and 17 subregions were divided for the unsaturated zone the bottom layer was further divided into six layers vertically for the numerical simulation the longitudinal dispersion for the saturated zone was set as 10 m based on the scale of the study site and previous studies zhao 2011 li 2009 gelhar et al 1992 the soil type of the unsaturated zone was set based on the field investigation the longitudinal dispersion immobile soil water content fraction and the first order mass transfer coefficient for the unsaturated zone were set as 0 4 m 0 2 and 0 001 d 1 based on the previous study of hetao irrigation district mao et al 2020 the input data used for longsheng irrigation area modelling are listed in table 5 3 3 2 model validation the 17 subregions were combined into six zones based on the adjacency of soil water and soil salt for comparison fig 10 shows the comparison between the simulated soil water content profiles and soil salt content profiles and the observed results for different zones after crop harvest and the statistical index values for different zones are listed in table 6 for soil water content profiles the mre values are smaller than 20 and the rmse values are smaller than 0 05 cm3 cm3 and the nse values are bigger than 0 03 and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 17 for soil salt content profiles the mre values are smaller than 40 and the rmse values are smaller than 0 50 g kg and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 05 the simulation results can roughly reflect the observation results poor performance was caused by the significant spatial variability of soil water content and soil salt content fig 11 shows the comparison between the statistical results of simulated soil water content profiles and soil salt content profiles after crop harvest as numbers of soil points were observed within the study site the box plot was used to present the observed soil water contents and soil salt contents it can be found that most of the simulated soil water contents and soil salt contents fall within the inter quartile range of the observed values which shows a satisfactory performance of the simulation the statistical index values are listed in table 6 for soil water content profile it can be found that the mre values are smaller than 9 and the rmse values are smaller than 0 025 cm3 cm3 and the nse values are bigger than 0 30 and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 60 for soil salt content profile the mre values are smaller than 14 and the rmse values are smaller than 0 20 g kg and the nse values are bigger than 0 08 and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 90 in general the results indicate that the developed model can reasonably simulate the unsaturated soil water movement and salt transport processes fig 12 shows the comparison between the simulated and observed spatial distribution of the soil salt content at different depths after crop harvest it can be found that the simulated spatial distribution of the soil salt content at different depths is close to the observed results for soil salts in 0 60 cm and 60 120 cm both the simulation results and the observation results shown the soil salts accumulated in the east central part of the study site besides larger values and wider range of soil salts can be found in 60 120 cm comparing with the results in 0 60 cm the reason is that large amount of soil salts accumulated near the ground surface due to the significant evapotranspiration during the crop growth season but there was an extreme precipitation on september 1 which leached soil salts to a deeper depth moreover it can be found that most of the soil salts accumulated within 0 60 cm and 60 120 cm while the soil salts in 120 180 cm were significantly less than the other depths the simulated values were inconsistent with the observed values in the well irrigated area and other regions such as the northwest area it can be explained that the well irrigated area is irrigated with more concentrated groundwater and the simulated results are larger the poor performance of other regions was caused by the significant spatial variability of soil salt in general the results presented above indicate that the developed model can reasonably simulate the unsaturated salt transport for the regional scale problem the observed and the simulated groundwater table depths for the whole study site and different observation wells are shown in fig 13 the simulated average groundwater table depths are consistent with the observed values as shown in fig 13 a the statistical index values are listed in table 6 it can be found that for the regional average groundwater table depths the mre value is smaller than 11 the rmse value is smaller than 0 3 m the nse value is bigger than 0 60 and the r 2 value is bigger than 0 70 for the individual observation wells the rmse values of the groundwater table depth are smaller than 0 60 m and the nse and r 2 values are bigger than 0 30 and 0 40 the statistical index values of simulated groundwater table depths for individual observation wells are slightly worse than the regional averaged results but the results still indicate a satisfactory performance of the developed model for the regional scale problem the poor performance values are explained as follows negative groundwater table depths were founded during the autumn irrigation which caused the worse mre values of well 1 as shown in table 6 moreover the quantity of water calculated by spread all canal diverted water over the farm land was used as the upper boundary condition during the simulation which were smaller than the actual irrigation per unit area because it is difficult to distinguish the large number of roads field canals and ditches from the actual irrigation area for the regional scale problem thus the observed groundwater table depths are smaller than the calculated values especially during the autumn irrigation period considering the regional averaged results the developed model can capture the characteristic of the saturated water movement in the study site the computation times of the real world case is 223 s which is efficient considering the scale and complexity of the problem above all the calculation results indicate that the developed model can reasonably describe the unsaturated saturated water movement and salt transport processes of practical regional scale problems in arid and semi arid agricultural areas 4 conclusions the study developed a quasi 3 d model for simulating regional scale saturated unsaturated water movement and solute transport in arid and semi arid agricultural areas a new dual iterative coupling scheme was used to couple soil water movement with groundwater movement and to couple soil solute transport with groundwater solute transport moreover the adaptive time step linking scheme the extra equation for upward flux driven by the matric potential and the mobile immobile assumption were adopted in the developed model which made the model more suitable for describing unsaturated saturated water movement and salt transport processes in regional scale arid and semi arid agricultural areas synthetic and real world cases were designed to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the quasi 3 d model the major conclusions drawn from the evaluation are as follows 1 the dual iterative coupling scheme which iterative coupling the soil water movement and groundwater movement modules and the soil solute transport and groundwater solute transport modules is developed 2 the mre values of the synthetic cases are less than 15 and the mre values of the real world cases are less than 35 which demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model besides the model is almost twice as computationally efficient as the fully numerical methods based on richards equation when the problem is a 2d problem with a scale of 10 m the computationally efficiency of the developed model is greater higher when the situation is more complex 3 results calculated by the developed model with different spatial and temporal discretization and stress period are similar as the differences of mre values for different scenarios in case 1 are less than 1 while spatial discretization has more obvious influence than temporal discretization as the differences of mre values for different scenarios in case 1 are close to 5 4 the assumption that ignoring the lateral soil water movement and solute transport in the unsaturated zone may lead to systematic errors therefore attention needs to be paid that the quasi 3 d model is more suitable for the regional scale problems 5 data availability all the data and codes used in this study can be requested by email to the

4241,soil water in an unsaturated zone is the major source of groundwater recharge and likewise soil contaminants are the major source of groundwater contamination it is thus essential to jointly consider soil water movement and solute transport together with groundwater movement and solute transport which is particularly important when addressing regional scale problems this study developed a new quasi 3 d model for simulating regional scale saturated unsaturated water movement and solute transport in arid and semi arid agricultural areas the unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport processes are simulated by a 1 d soil water and solute transport model referred to as ubmod and the saturated groundwater movement and solute transport are simulated by modflow and mt3dms in the quasi 3 d model the soil water movement and groundwater movement modules are iteratively coupled and the soil solute transport and groundwater solute transport modules are iteratively couple this is referred to as a dual iterative coupling scheme strength and weakness of the quasi 3 d model and the coupling scheme were evaluated with two synthetic cases and a real world application results indicate satisfactory performance of the model which demonstrates the reliability of the dual iterative coupling scheme besides the impacts of spatial and temporal discretization and stress period on model stability and accuracy has been evaluated and the model is more computationally efficient than the fully numerical methods based on richards equation when the problem is a 2d 3d problem with a scale larger than 10 m moreover the application to the hetao irrigation district indicates that the developed model is effective and efficient for the real world regional scale agricultural problems above all it is concluded that the new model is more suitable than existing models for simulating regional scale unsaturated saturated soil water movement and solute transport in arid and semi arid agricultural areas keywords regional scale problems quasi three dimensional model unsaturated saturated water movement and solute transport dual iterative coupling scheme 1 introduction soil solutes in the unsaturated zone are major sources of groundwater contamination yang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 it is thus essential to jointly consider unsaturated solute transport together with saturated solute transport this is particularly true when addressing regional scale problems such as groundwater exploitation and protection soil salinization non point source contamination du et al 2020 rumynin et al 2020 liu et al 2020 shokri kuehni et al 2020 tian et al 2012 various numerical models have been developed in the last several decades to simulate the processes involved in regional scale saturated unsaturated solute transport many models are based on fully three dimensional 3 d schemes such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2012 feflow diersch 2013 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 and parflow maxwell et al 2009 which numerically solve the 3 d richards equation and advection dispersion equation while these models are physically based and mathematically rigorous they are challenged by the incompatible spatial and temporal scales of various hydrological processes in the unsaturated and saturated zones beegum et al 2019 specifically speaking the spatial and temporal discretization of the unsaturated zone has to be fine enough e g centimeter in length and second in time because of the highly nonlinear relationships between the soil water content θ the pressure head h and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ and the influence of drastic fluctuations of the atmospheric boundary zha et al 2019 farthing and ogden 2017 downer and ogden 2004 the spatial and temporal discretization for the saturated zone can be coarser with the spatial step size ranging from a few meters to several kilometers and the temporal step size ranging from days to months because the saturated flow is less nonlinear than the unsaturated flow as a result the numerical solutions of the fully 3 d models may be difficult to converge and computationally expensive for regional scale problems shen and phanikumar 2010 the simplified schemes have been introduced based on the characteristics of the regional scale problems such as the quasi 3 d scheme which ignores lateral flows in the unsaturated zone and describes the soil water movement and solute transport as one dimensional 1 d processes in the vertical direction but still treats the groundwater movement and solute transport as 3 d processes beegum et al 2019 kuznetsov et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 ranatunga et al 2008 the scheme has been widely used for regional scale saturated unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport problems zhang et al 2020 beegum et al 2020 mao et al 2019 szymkiewicz et al 2018 beegum et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 morway et al 2013 yakirevich et al 2013 xu et al 2012 kuznetsov et al 2012 shen and phanikumar 2010 markstrom et al 2008 twarakavi et al 2008 seo et al 2007 niswonger et al 2006 stoppelenburg et al 2005 this study used the quasi 3 d scheme for tackling unsaturated saturated soil salt transport problems in regional scale arid and semi arid agricultural areas which has been received extensive attention in recent years daliakopoulos et al 2016 assouline et al 2015 however there are still some issues to consider the first one is the level of coupling the saturated and unsaturated modules based on their levels of coupling the quasi 3 d models can be classified into three different kinds i e uncoupled iteratively coupled and fully coupled models furman 2008 for uncoupled models during each time step of numerical simulation one module usually the unsaturated module is firstly solved based on the defined interface boundary conditions usually the results of the previous time step then the interface boundary conditions are updated and the other module is solved the uncoupled models are easy to implement and thus widely used in computer codes such as uzf modflow mt3dms morway et al 2013 uzf modflow rt3d bailey et al 2013 pht3d uzf wu et al 2016 and hydrus modflow mt3dms beegum et al 2019 however the one way information passing and no feedback calculation may result in mass balance errors shen and phanikumar 2010 the iteratively coupled models differ from the uncouple models in that the former models re run the first module with the updated interface boundary conditions until convergence criteria are achieved which increases model accuracy but also increases computational cost the iteratively coupled scheme have also been widely used for saturated unsaturated water flow problems mao et al 2019 kuznetsov et al 2012 stoppelenburg et al 2005 liang et al 2003 yakirevich et al 1998 and the scheme has been further extended to saturated unsaturated solute transport problems fully coupled models are mathematically and computationally rigorous as they solve the unsaturated module the saturated module and the interface boundary conditions simultaneously zhu et al 2013 however the fully coupled models are computationally expensive and difficult to implement due to the frequent interactions between the saturated zone and unsaturated zone caused by significant evapotranspiration and intensive irrigation in arid and semi arid agricultural areas a new iterative coupling scheme has been developed to simulate the regional scale salt transport problems in addition to the choice of the level of coupling another practical issue is how to link the water movement and solute transport modules the solute transport module based on the eulerian method may suffer from numerical dispersion and artificial oscillation and they may be controlled by using peclet number and courant number to ensure numerical stability and accuracy of the solute transport module a common practice is to reduce the size of time steps zheng and wang 1999 which may lead to a mismatch between the time steps of flow simulation and the time steps of the solute transport simulation it is conventional to further discretize the water movement time steps into the solute transport time steps and to assume a constant flow rate during the solute transport time steps as mt3dms does however the unsaturated soil water movement and salt transport changes drastically especially near the soil surface the mismatch of time steps may cause a non negligible deviation for the unsaturated zone therefore an adaptive time step linking scheme between the unsaturated soil water movement and the solute transport has been used to improve computational accuracy for the practical agricultural problems in this study the last issue is about the difficulties of describing the solute transport processes under practical conditions very fine spatial and temporal discretization and intensive input data and model parameters are required when solving the hydraulic processes in the unsaturated zone visconti et al 2011 which are not always available in regional scale problems moreover the advection dispersion equation is inadequate to describe significantly anomalous transport phenomena e g preferential and non equilibrium solute transport which has been observed in practice because of the strong heterogeneity of the porous media sternagel et al 2019 to alleviate the numerical difficulties several simplified approaches have been used such as the kinematic wave equation adopted by the uzf modflow mt3dms method and the tipping bucket method kendy et al 2003 however both the approaches ignore the matric potential the upward soil water movement driven by the matric potential is important because soil salts accumulate near the soil surface due to the significant evapotranspiration in arid and semi arid agricultural areas in addition the significant anomalous transport phenomenon is not adequately described in the two approaches to overcome these deficiencies mao et al 2018 2020 developed a new model to simulate unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport based on the mass conservation principle the soil water movement module considers all the driven forces i e the gravitational potential the matric potential and external forces that impact the soil water movement and can simulate both upward and downward soil water movement in heterogeneous soils the solute transport module adopts the mobile immobile assumption to describe the significant anomalous transport phenomenon the model is efficient and has satisfactory performance for coarse spatial and temporal discretization which make it suitable for regional scale modeling this study developed a new quasi 3 d model for simulating regional scale saturated unsaturated solute transport problems in arid and semi arid agricultural areas the unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport processes are described by the 1 d soil water and solute transport model referred to as ubmod mao et al 2018 2020 and the saturated groundwater movement and solute transport processes are described by modflow harbaugh 2005 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 because the soil water movement and groundwater movement modules are iteratively coupled and the soil solute transport and groundwater solute transport modules are also iteratively coupled our method is referred to as the dual iterative coupling scheme the objectives of this study are to 1 introduce the methodology of the new quasi 3 d water movement and solute transport model and 2 evaluate the strength and weakness of the developed model under synthetic and real world conditions 2 methodology and model development the quasi 3 d scheme has been adopted to develop the new model in particular the unsaturated zone is divided into several subregions based on their similar characteristics elevation soil types land usage crop types and only the vertical unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport processes within a subregion are considered while the horizontal heterogeneity in each subregion is ignored on the contrary the saturated groundwater movement and solute transport processes are treated as 3 d processes the new model can be composed by several modules in this section the 1 d soil water movement module the soil solute transport module the groundwater movement module and the groundwater solute transport module are first introduced in sequence in sect 2 1 and sect 2 2 since the modules are already published they are only briefly described afterward the relationship of these modules is described in sect 2 3 and the calculation procedures of the dual iterative coupling scheme is elaborated in sect 2 4 2 1 1 d soil water movement and solute transport modules the 1 d soil water movement and solute transport modules are based on ubmod which are based on the principle of mass conservation and has been published in mao et al 2020 2018 in this study these modules considering the lower boundary of the groundwater table and the water and solute exchange between saturated zone and unsaturated zone have been added comparing to the original version more details would be found in the appendix for the soil water three driven forces i e the gravitational potential the matric potential and external forces are considered to impact soil water movement and there are totally five calculation steps during each time step of the simulation as shown in fig 1 a firstly the spatial discretization of the unsaturated zone is adjusted to ensure all the soil layers are above the groundwater table while a virtual layer is added under the groundwater table for the calculation of groundwater consumption then the allocation of the infiltration is applied moreover the soil water movement driven by gravitational potential external forces and matric potential are calculated the detailed introduction and governing equations can be found in mao et al 2018 the flux across the groundwater table can be obtained and is referred to as the groundwater recharge for the solute the mobile immobile assumption is adopted to describe the significant anomalous transport phenomenon observed in practice and the soil water content θ is separated into the soil water content θm in the mobile region and the soil water content θim in the immobile region for a specific layer the solute advective process the chemical reaction process the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions and the solute dispersive process are considered in the mobile region while only the chemical reaction process and the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions are considered in the immobile region as shown in fig 1 b the specific governing equations are presented in mao et al 2020 2 2 groundwater movement and salt transport modules modflow is used to describe the groundwater movement process which is a three dimensional block centered finite difference groundwater model developed by usgs and is the most widely used computer code for groundwater modeling the governing equation solved by modflow is 1 x i k ii h x i w s s s h t where i indicates the x y or z directions kii is the saturated conductivity along the coordinate axes lt 1 h is the potentiometric head l ws is the volumetric flux per unit volume representing the source sink term of groundwater t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 mt3dms is used to describe the groundwater solute transport process which is developed for using with any block centered finite difference flow model such as modflow the model has comprehensive capabilities for simulating advection dispersion and chemical reactions of solute transport in a groundwater aquifer zheng and wang 1999 the governing equation solved by mt3dms is 2 ϕ c t x i ϕ d ij c x j x i ϕ v g i c w s c s r n where ϕ indicates the porosity for the saturated porous media l3l 3 c is the dissolved concentration of the solute ml 3 dij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2t 1 vg is the water velocity which is the darcy flux calculated by the groundwater movement module lt 1 ws is the volumetric flow per unit volume representing the source sink term of groundwater t 1 and cs is the concentration of the source sink term ml 3 rn is the chemical reaction term ml 3t 1 modflow and mt3dms are linked via a flow transport link file which involves the saturated thickness fluxes across cell interfaces in all directions and locations and flow rates of various source sink terms calculated by the groundwater model flopy bakker et al 2016 is a python package for creating running and post processing modflow based models and has been used to run modflow and mt3dms 2 3 spatial and temporal coupling scheme of different modules the regional scale saturated unsaturated water movement and solute transport processes have been divided into four modules i e the unsaturated soil water movement module the saturated groundwater movement module the unsaturated soil solute transport module and the saturated solute transport module and the specific calculation procedures within each module are described above the links between different modules are shown in fig 2 a and the temporal coupling methods between different modules are shown in fig 2 b the simulation period is divided into a series of stress period δt which has been used to specify the stress data of saturated modules and the exchange information of the iterative coupling each module has its own time step and the time step of the unsaturated soil water movement module and the solute transport module is denoted as δtu while the time steps of the saturated groundwater movement module and the solute transport module are denoted as δtsw and δtss respectively during each stress period in the calculations the unsaturated soil water movement module and the saturated groundwater movement module are iteratively coupled via the groundwater recharge r and the groundwater table depth g d specifically the unsaturated soil water movement module runs with the groundwater table as the lower boundary condition and calculates the groundwater recharge during the stress period the saturated groundwater movement module runs with the groundwater recharge and calculates the groundwater table depth the procedures will be repeated until the convergence criterion is met the water movement results calculated by the unsaturated soil water movement module and the saturated groundwater movement module are saved for solute transport modules the saturated solute transport module will discretize the groundwater movement time steps into shorter parts and keep the groundwater flow rate stable when there is a mismatch between the saturated water movement adopted time steps and the saturated solute transport needed time steps however the unsaturated modules will rerun the unsaturated soil water movement module with a decreased time step until the match between the soil water movement time step and soil solute transport time step which is referred to as an adaptive time step linking scheme the courant number cr is used to estimate the suitable time step additionally the unsaturated solute transport module and the saturated solute transport module are iteratively coupled via the groundwater recharge concentration c r and the shallow groundwater concentration c g specifically the unsaturated solute transport module adopts the shallow groundwater concentration c g as the lower boundary condition of the unsaturated zone while the saturated solute transport module adopts the concentration of groundwater recharge c r as the upper boundary condition the iterative procedures will also be repeated until the convergence criterion is met 2 4 calculation procedures of the developed model the specific flow chart of the dual iterative coupling scheme during one stress period is shown in fig 3 the simulation time of the stress period is from t to t δt and the variables calculated in this stress period are denoted by the superscript t assume that l subregions are used for the study area and the saturated zone is divided into m rows n columns and k layers the initial groundwater table depth and the shallow groundwater concentration of the stress period are g d t 1 and c d t 1 m n dimension which are the results calculated during the previous stress period the calculation procedures are as follows a assuming that the water movement iteration level is p and the groundwater table depth g d t p 1 is the result calculated during the previous iteration level when the model runs at the first level of iteration the result calculated during the previous iteration level p 0 is equal to g d t 1 the l th subregion is chosen as an example and the area of the subregion is sl l2 the unsaturated zone depth is equal to the groundwater table depth and the average depth is calculated as 3 m u l t p s l g d t p 1 d s s l g d t 1 d s 2 s l where m u l t p indicates the averaged unsaturated zone depth of the l th subregion during the t stress period and the p th iteration l the equation means that the unsaturated zone depth during the p th iteration of the l th subregion is the average value in time and space of the groundwater table depth calculated during the p 1th iteration of the stress period similarly the unsaturated zone depths for all subregions can be obtained and are denoted as m u t p l dimension b the model runs the unsaturated soil water movement module with the time step δtu from t to t δt the soil water flux vu the soil water content and various source sink terms calculated by the unsaturated soil water movement module are stored c the courant number is calculated if the courant number exceeds 1 the calculation time step will be decreased and the soil water movement module will be rerun with the adjusted time step until the criterion cr 1 is satisfied d the average groundwater recharge rate r for all time steps of the l th subregion from t to t δt can be obtained by 4 r t t δ t r δ t where r indicates the groundwater recharge rate l then the average groundwater recharge rate matrix for the entire area can be obtained represented as r t p m n dimension by assigning each value calculated by the soil columns to the corresponding finite difference grids e the groundwater recharge rate r t p is transferred to the saturated groundwater movement module and is used in the rch package of modflow the developed model then runs modflow with the time step δtsw to obtain the saturated hydraulic head and the groundwater table depth at the end of the stress period which are marked as h t p and g d t p f the convergence of water movement modules is determined based on the following two criteria 5 max h t p h t p 1 ε w 6 max g d t p g d t p 1 ε w where εw is the tolerance error of the water coupling processes l which is defined by the users if the criteria are met the iteration of water movement modules stops and h t p and g d t p are the convergent results for the stress period otherwise the iteration continues to the p 1th calculation until the convergence criteria are met g assume that the solute transport iteration level is q and the shallow groundwater concentration calculated during the previous iteration level is c d t q 1 m n dimension the lower boundary condition of the l th subregion used for the unsaturated solute transport module is 7 c d l t q s l c d t q 1 d s s l c d t 1 d s 2 s l where c d l t q indicates the lower concentration boundary of the unsaturated zone for the l th subregion ml 3 the equation means that the lower concentration boundary of the unsaturated zone during the q th iteration of the l th subregion is the average value in time and space of the shallow groundwater concentration calculated during the q 1th iteration of the stress period the lower concentration boundaries of the unsaturated zone for all subregions are denoted as c d t q l dimension h the developed model runs the unsaturated solute transport module with the time step δtu from t to t δt the groundwater recharge concentration can be obtained which is converted to an m n dimensional matrix and denoted as c r t q i the groundwater recharge concentration c r t q is transferred to the saturated solute transport module and mt3dms runs with the upper boundary condition to obtain the solute distribution j the convergence of the solute transport modules is determined based on the following two criteria 8 max c d t q c d t q 1 ε s 9 max c r t q c r t q 1 ε s where εs is the tolerance error of the solute coupling processes ml 3 if the criteria are met the calculation procedures for this stress period ended otherwise the iteration continues to the q 1th calculation until the convergence criteria are met the model was implemented by a hybrid programming method of python and fortran the pre processing post processing and control of the calculation procedures were developed by python scripts considering its large number of extension libraries for scientific analysis and geospatial data computation while the saturated and unsaturated water movement and solute transport processes were calculated by fortran considering its excellent computational efficiency the fortran codes for unsaturated soil water movement and solute transport were compiled into a python package and the flopy package was used to run the saturated groundwater and solute transport modules 3 model evaluation in this section two synthetic cases and a real world application were designed to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the developed model the simulation results of the two synthetic cases were compared with the results obtained by hydrus 1d and swms 2d and those of the real world application are compared with field observations and experiments the comparison results were quantified using the mean absolute relative error mre the root mean squared error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the determination coefficient r 2 which are defined as 10 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 12 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 13 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where the subscript i indicates the serial number of the results n indicates the total number of the results yi indicates the simulated result yi indicates the reference result y is the averaged simulated result and y is the averaged reference result 3 1 case 1 1 d soil salt transport this case was used to test the performance of the dual iterative coupling scheme under complicated upper boundary conditions and heterogeneous situations the case considers 1 d soil water movement and salt transport in a field profile of the hupselse beek watershed in the netherlands which was used as a demo in the hydrus 1d technical manual šimůnek et al 2013 in this case soil salt has a pronounced accumulation near the soil surface the simulation results calculated by hydrus 1d were used as the reference values scenarios with different spatial and temporal discretization of the unsaturated modules and different stress period were used for the model evaluation the depth of the profile is 2 3 m and the profile consists of a 0 4 m thick upper layer and a 1 9 m thick bottom layer the top of the profile is covered by grass and the depth of the root zone is 0 3 m the upper boundary condition containing the precipitation and the actual transpiration rates is presented in fig 4 the lower boundary condition is a prescribed drainage condition the groundwater table depth was initially set at 0 55 m below the surface and the initial salt concentration for the whole profile was a constant and set as 10 g l the simulation time is 183 days from april 1 to september 30 the soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 1 twelve scenarios were set in this case which were used to evaluate the influence of the spatial and temporal discretization as well as the stress period on performance of the developed model the details of the scenarios are listed in table 2 the comparison between the groundwater levels calculated by the developed model and those simulated by hydurs 1d for scenario 1a are shown in fig 5 a the figure shows that the results given by the developed model are consistent with the hydrus 1d results the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the groundwater level are 9 1 0 11 m 0 953 and 0 994 respectively the comparison of the soil water content and the salt concentration of the observation point at the depth of 0 15 m for scenario 1a are shown in fig 5 b and fig 5 c respectively the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the soil water content at the depth of 0 15 m are 4 1 0 014 cm3 cm3 0 881 and 0 930 respectively while the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the salt concentration at the depth of 0 15 m are 6 7 2 29 g l 0 975 and 0 980 respectively the comparison of soil water content profiles and salt concentration profiles at different times for scenario 1a are shown in fig 5 d and fig 5 e the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the soil water content profiles are 2 5 4 6 0 009 cm3 cm3 0 014 cm3 cm3 0 971 0 979 and 0 915 0 943 respectively the mre rmse nse and r 2 values for the salt concentration profiles are 3 2 3 5 1 84 g l 1 33 g l 0 937 0 979 and 0 948 0 980 respectively the values calculated by the developed model fit the reference values well moreover the statistical index values of the soil salt concentration at the depth of 0 15 m and salt concentration profiles at the ending time for different scenarios are listed in table 3 all mre values are smaller than 15 and r 2 values are bigger than 0 90 it can be concluded that the values calculated by the developed model for all scenarios fit the reference values therefore the calculation results indicate a satisfactory performance of the developed model moreover the salt transport results with different spatial and temporal discretization of the unsaturated modules and different stress period were compared and the results of the salt concentration of the observation point at the depth of 0 15 m and salt concentration profiles at the ending time are shown in fig 6 scenarios 1a 1b and 1c have different calculation time steps while scenarios 1b 1e and 1h have different spatial steps and scenarios 1a and 1 j have different stress period the statistical index values of the salt concentration at the depth of 0 15 m and salt concentration profiles at the ending time are shown in table 3 for the scenarios with different time steps such as 1a 1b and 1c it can be found that the quantitative differences of mre values and r 2 values for the soil salt content at the depth of 0 15 m and the salt concentration profiles at the ending time for different scenarios are all smaller than 1 0 and 0 01 respectively for the scenarios with different stress period such as 1a and 1 j the quantitative differences of mre values and r 2 values for results of different scenarios are smaller than 1 0 and 0 01 respectively for the scenarios with different spatial steps such as 1b 1e and 1h the quantitative differences of mre values and r 2 values for results of different scenarios are close to 5 0 and 0 04 which are larger than the previous values and obvious inconsistence can be found in fig 6 b when comparing with fig 6 a and fig 6 c the results indicate that the difference of results calculated by the developed model with different time steps and stress period was little while the difference of results calculated by the developed model with different spatial steps was obvious the reason is the effect of the numerical dispersion which is caused by the truncation error therefore the scenario with coarse spatial discretization may lead to smoother values instead of the fluctuations and extreme values performed with finer discretization the developed model was run on a personal computer with the cpu of amd ryzen 7 3700x 8 core processor and 32 g memory the computation times of different scenarios are shown in table 2 the computation time of hydrus 1d is 0 7 s while the computation times of the developed model range from 9 s to 18 s the developed model takes longer computation time than hydrus 1d in the one dimensional case because of the complicated iterative coupling 3 2 case 2 2 d solute transport case with the steady soil water movement condition this case considered a 2 d soil water movement and solute transport problem and the purpose of the case is to estimate the limitations of the quasi 3 d scheme the modeling domain is a 10 m 5 m rectangular vertical plane as shown in fig 7 a the initial groundwater level was 2 m a constant flux q was applied at the top of the domain the bottom layer was a no flux boundary and the hydraulic head at the left and right boundaries were fixed a constant solute boundary condition was applied at the surface from x 4 m to x 6 m and the concentration was 1 g l the soil type in the domain is loam and hydraulic parameters adopted in this case are listed in table 1 the results simulated by swms 2d were used as the reference values and the simulation domain was divided into 5151 finite element nodes for the calculation of swms 2d for the developed model ten equal size subregions are used to represent the unsaturated zone the spatial discretization adopted by the unsaturated modules and the saturated modules of the developed model is 0 1 m five scenarios with different longitudinal dispersivity dl and different transverse dispersivity dt were set in this case the parameters used by different scenarios are listed in table 4 the groundwater level and solute concentration results of scenario 2a calculated by swms 2d and the developed model are shown in fig 7 b it can be found that the solute calculated by swms 2d moves farther in the x direction while the solute calculated by the developed model are more likely to move downwards in the z direction the reason is that due to the obstruction of the lower boundary the groundwater between x 4 m and x 6 m remains almost static in swms 2d results meanwhile there are obvious lateral soil water movement near the groundwater level which leads to the obvious solute transport in the x direction however the developed model calculates the water movement in the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone separately and ignores the lateral soil water movement in the unsaturated zone therefore the groundwater is vertically recharged in the developed model which leads to the downward water movement and solute transport in the z direction in the region under groundwater level between x 4 m and x 6 m above all the rmse nse and r 2 values for the solute concentration are 0 099 g l 0 890 and 0 895 respectively the results calculated by the developed model show a similar changing trend to those of swms 2d although the quasi 3 d assumption which ignoring the lateral soil water movement leads to systematic errors moreover the results calculated by swms 2d and the developed model of the different scenarios are shown in fig 7 b and the scenarios 2a 2b and 2c have different longitudinal dispersivity dl while the scenarios 2a 2d and 2e have different transverse dispersivity dt the statistical index values of different scenarios are listed in table 4 for scenarios 2a 2b and 2c the rmse values range from 0 099 g l to 0 118 g l and the nse values range from 0 857 to 0 890 and the r 2 values range from 0 861 to 0 894 it can be found that the statistical index values change slightly when different values of longitudinal dispersivity are taken besides the better results can be obtained with a larger longitudinal dispersivity moreover for scenarios 2a 2d and 2e the rmse values range from 0 099 g l to 0 105 g l and the nse values range from 0 834 to 0 890 and the r 2 values range from 0 868 to 0 894 it can be found that the better results correspond to a lower transverse dispersivity the major calculation errors of the developed model for this case are caused by ignoring the lateral soil water movement and solute transport in the unsaturated zone for all scenarios the rmse values of the developed model are smaller than 0 12 g l the nse values are bigger than 0 83 and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 86 the calculation results are acceptable the computation times of different scenarios are shown in table 4 the computation times of the developed model range from 5 s to 6 s while the computation time of swms 2d range from 10 s to 11 s it can be concluded that the computation efficiency of the developed model is 2 times faster than swms 2d in this case considering the results of case 1 it is anticipated that the developed model is more efficient with complicated larger scale problems 3 3 case 3 regional scale salt transport problem in hetao irrigation district in real world regional scale agricultural areas the lateral hydraulic gradient and the transverse dispersivity are usually significantly small therefore considering the characteristic of the hydrological cycle processes and the computational efficiency the quasi 3 d assumption for the regional scale arid and semi arid agricultural areas is more physically reasonable and computationally efficient 3 3 1 study site and input data in this case the developed model was applied to the hetao irrigation district which is a representative agricultural area in arid and semi arid regions with problems of salinization and improper water use fig 8 a shows the location of the specific study site the longsheng irrigation area 107 27 22 8 107 32 40 3 e 40 49 15 9 40 55 25 4 n which belongs to hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china the study site is 11 6 km long from north to south and 7 km wide from east to west and the area of the study site is 37 88 km2 the study site is surrounded by irrigation canals and drainage ditches the major part of the study area was irrigated by surface water from the xiji branch canal which was diverted from the yellow river while the southwestern part of the study site was irrigated by groundwater the study site was divided into 17 subregions based on the distribution of field canals in the study site which were shown in fig 8 b the surface elevation decreases from 1037 9 m to 1035 8 m which is shown in fig 8 c geological survey has been carried out by the regulation agencies and the distribution of the boreholes near the study site is shown in fig 8 d six boreholes are connected into two geological sections near the study site which are referred to as ⅰ ⅱ and iii ⅳ the vertical soil type distributions of the boreholes are shown in fig 8 f the study site is underlain by lake sediments and alluvial deposits from the yellow river and a mud clay layer is found below q3 stratum which is considered as the impervious layer the zone above the impervious layer is considered to be the unconfined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer is composed of q4 stratum and q3 stratum as shown in fig 2 f the upper layer of the q4 stratum has a lower permeability and is primarily loam with a thickness between 4 2 m and 7 2 m the bottom layer of the q4 stratum and q3 stratum has a relatively high permeability and is primarily sand with a thickness between 108 6 m and 131 4 m seven boreholes with pumping test around the study site were used to obtain the horizontal hydraulic conductivities and the results are shown in fig 8 e the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the bottom layer range from 13 46 m d to 17 81 m d and the average value is 15 33 m d for the upper layer of the study area near the ground surface the horizontal hydraulic conductivities range from 2 20 m d to 2 91 m d based on soil type composed primarily by loam mao et al 2017 and the average value is 2 50 m d due to the special climate crops in the study area are planted for only one time from may to september per year and an intensive irrigation called autumn irrigation is applied for soil salt leaching during october the rest seasons of the year are cold and dry and the land is fallow the regional scale water and salt transport processes were observed during the crop growth period in 2018 there were 5 groundwater observation wells and the distribution of the wells can be found in fig 8 a the groundwater table depths were observed 3 times every month from may to october the groundwater concentrations were observed during the first week of may besides 41 soil water and salt observation points were set within the study area as shown in fig 8 c the soil water contents and soil salt were measured every 20 cm in a vertical direction at each observation point before and after the crop growth period the reference evapotranspiration et 0 precipitation p and irrigation i in 2018 are shown in fig 9 the meteorological data were obtained from a weather station 10 km away from the study site and the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration et 0 the simulation period was set from may 1 2018 to october 31 2018 and a warm up period of 30 days was adopted the saturated zone of the test area was divided horizontally into 150 100 finite difference grids and 17 subregions were divided for the unsaturated zone the bottom layer was further divided into six layers vertically for the numerical simulation the longitudinal dispersion for the saturated zone was set as 10 m based on the scale of the study site and previous studies zhao 2011 li 2009 gelhar et al 1992 the soil type of the unsaturated zone was set based on the field investigation the longitudinal dispersion immobile soil water content fraction and the first order mass transfer coefficient for the unsaturated zone were set as 0 4 m 0 2 and 0 001 d 1 based on the previous study of hetao irrigation district mao et al 2020 the input data used for longsheng irrigation area modelling are listed in table 5 3 3 2 model validation the 17 subregions were combined into six zones based on the adjacency of soil water and soil salt for comparison fig 10 shows the comparison between the simulated soil water content profiles and soil salt content profiles and the observed results for different zones after crop harvest and the statistical index values for different zones are listed in table 6 for soil water content profiles the mre values are smaller than 20 and the rmse values are smaller than 0 05 cm3 cm3 and the nse values are bigger than 0 03 and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 17 for soil salt content profiles the mre values are smaller than 40 and the rmse values are smaller than 0 50 g kg and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 05 the simulation results can roughly reflect the observation results poor performance was caused by the significant spatial variability of soil water content and soil salt content fig 11 shows the comparison between the statistical results of simulated soil water content profiles and soil salt content profiles after crop harvest as numbers of soil points were observed within the study site the box plot was used to present the observed soil water contents and soil salt contents it can be found that most of the simulated soil water contents and soil salt contents fall within the inter quartile range of the observed values which shows a satisfactory performance of the simulation the statistical index values are listed in table 6 for soil water content profile it can be found that the mre values are smaller than 9 and the rmse values are smaller than 0 025 cm3 cm3 and the nse values are bigger than 0 30 and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 60 for soil salt content profile the mre values are smaller than 14 and the rmse values are smaller than 0 20 g kg and the nse values are bigger than 0 08 and the r 2 values are bigger than 0 90 in general the results indicate that the developed model can reasonably simulate the unsaturated soil water movement and salt transport processes fig 12 shows the comparison between the simulated and observed spatial distribution of the soil salt content at different depths after crop harvest it can be found that the simulated spatial distribution of the soil salt content at different depths is close to the observed results for soil salts in 0 60 cm and 60 120 cm both the simulation results and the observation results shown the soil salts accumulated in the east central part of the study site besides larger values and wider range of soil salts can be found in 60 120 cm comparing with the results in 0 60 cm the reason is that large amount of soil salts accumulated near the ground surface due to the significant evapotranspiration during the crop growth season but there was an extreme precipitation on september 1 which leached soil salts to a deeper depth moreover it can be found that most of the soil salts accumulated within 0 60 cm and 60 120 cm while the soil salts in 120 180 cm were significantly less than the other depths the simulated values were inconsistent with the observed values in the well irrigated area and other regions such as the northwest area it can be explained that the well irrigated area is irrigated with more concentrated groundwater and the simulated results are larger the poor performance of other regions was caused by the significant spatial variability of soil salt in general the results presented above indicate that the developed model can reasonably simulate the unsaturated salt transport for the regional scale problem the observed and the simulated groundwater table depths for the whole study site and different observation wells are shown in fig 13 the simulated average groundwater table depths are consistent with the observed values as shown in fig 13 a the statistical index values are listed in table 6 it can be found that for the regional average groundwater table depths the mre value is smaller than 11 the rmse value is smaller than 0 3 m the nse value is bigger than 0 60 and the r 2 value is bigger than 0 70 for the individual observation wells the rmse values of the groundwater table depth are smaller than 0 60 m and the nse and r 2 values are bigger than 0 30 and 0 40 the statistical index values of simulated groundwater table depths for individual observation wells are slightly worse than the regional averaged results but the results still indicate a satisfactory performance of the developed model for the regional scale problem the poor performance values are explained as follows negative groundwater table depths were founded during the autumn irrigation which caused the worse mre values of well 1 as shown in table 6 moreover the quantity of water calculated by spread all canal diverted water over the farm land was used as the upper boundary condition during the simulation which were smaller than the actual irrigation per unit area because it is difficult to distinguish the large number of roads field canals and ditches from the actual irrigation area for the regional scale problem thus the observed groundwater table depths are smaller than the calculated values especially during the autumn irrigation period considering the regional averaged results the developed model can capture the characteristic of the saturated water movement in the study site the computation times of the real world case is 223 s which is efficient considering the scale and complexity of the problem above all the calculation results indicate that the developed model can reasonably describe the unsaturated saturated water movement and salt transport processes of practical regional scale problems in arid and semi arid agricultural areas 4 conclusions the study developed a quasi 3 d model for simulating regional scale saturated unsaturated water movement and solute transport in arid and semi arid agricultural areas a new dual iterative coupling scheme was used to couple soil water movement with groundwater movement and to couple soil solute transport with groundwater solute transport moreover the adaptive time step linking scheme the extra equation for upward flux driven by the matric potential and the mobile immobile assumption were adopted in the developed model which made the model more suitable for describing unsaturated saturated water movement and salt transport processes in regional scale arid and semi arid agricultural areas synthetic and real world cases were designed to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the quasi 3 d model the major conclusions drawn from the evaluation are as follows 1 the dual iterative coupling scheme which iterative coupling the soil water movement and groundwater movement modules and the soil solute transport and groundwater solute transport modules is developed 2 the mre values of the synthetic cases are less than 15 and the mre values of the real world cases are less than 35 which demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model besides the model is almost twice as computationally efficient as the fully numerical methods based on richards equation when the problem is a 2d problem with a scale of 10 m the computationally efficiency of the developed model is greater higher when the situation is more complex 3 results calculated by the developed model with different spatial and temporal discretization and stress period are similar as the differences of mre values for different scenarios in case 1 are less than 1 while spatial discretization has more obvious influence than temporal discretization as the differences of mre values for different scenarios in case 1 are close to 5 4 the assumption that ignoring the lateral soil water movement and solute transport in the unsaturated zone may lead to systematic errors therefore attention needs to be paid that the quasi 3 d model is more suitable for the regional scale problems 5 data availability all the data and codes used in this study can be requested by email to the

4242,the impact of urban flooding is increasing due to the effects of increasing urbanisation and climate change the use of storages is a relatively well established approach to reduce peak flows and therefore reduce the need for costly upgrades to stormwater conveyance infrastructure recently real time control rtc has been considered as a means of increasing the performance of these storages however previous rtc studies have generally focussed on evaluating rtc with pre determined storage layouts i e storage locations and volumes and have ignored the impact of optimising the storage layout hence the objectives of this paper are i to introduce a two step approach to minimising peak flows at the catchment scale by firstly optimising the layout of distributed storages and then optimising their rtc strategies and ii to test the effectiveness of this approach on a real catchment in adelaide south australia results show that distributed storage with optimised layouts can achieve significantly higher peak flow reductions than more commonly used end of system storage these range from 5 for 100 m3 of system storage up to 40 for 700 m3 of system storage whereas end of system storage achieved no peak flow reduction for up to 700 m3 of storage the addition of optimised rtc to distributed storages is able to achieve an additional 10 in peak flow reduction this increase in performance due to rtc is more significant for smaller system storage volumes analysis of the flood hydrographs shows the system peak flow reductions are achieved by attenuating hydrographs at individual storages as well as delaying hydrographs to reduce their coincidence at the confluence of sub catchments these results highlight the potential for using optimised distributed storage layout and rtc as an alternative approach to end of system storage to reduce flood peaks keywords stormwater management real time control urban flooding simulation optimisation genetic algorithms 1 introduction urban flooding and its impacts are increasing as a result of increasing urbanization densification locatelli et al 2017 van der bruggen et al 2010 and climate change pandey et al 2003 increasing urbanization densification is likely to result in an increase in impervious areas reducing infiltration and evapotranspiration rates li et al li et al 2017 and increasing peak flows burns et al 2012 at the same time climate change is likely to cause an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme climate events including extreme storm events with very high rainfall intensity razavi et al 2020 which is predicted to further increase peak flows in stormwater systems sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2015 historically the way to deal with increasing peak flows has been to increase the capacity of stormwater conveyance systems booth et al 2004 walsh et al 2015 however this is likely to be costly and disruptive and might not be physically feasible in some instances due to the proximity of other services burns et al 2012 fletcher et al 2014 li et al 2017 poff et al 1997 richter et al 1997 an alternative to increasing the capacity of stormwater conveyance systems is to reduce system peak flow recently the real time control rtc of stormwater storage outlets has been considered as an effective way to achieve this berglund et al 2020 campisano et al 2017 shishegar et al 2018 for the purposes of flood mitigation the simplest rtc approach is to empty storages prior to impending storm events to maximise available storage campisano et al 2017 schubert et al 2017 xu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 however this approach has been shown to be ineffective for rainfall events for which runoff volume exceeds system storage volume di matteo et al 2019 liang et al 2019 schubert et al 2017 in order to deal with this shortcoming a number of studies have used rtc during storm events ibrahim 2020 li 2020 lund et al 2020 mullapudi et al 2020 sadler et al 2020 schütze et al 2002 which can be broadly grouped into two categories reactive control and predictive control for reactive control lund et al 2018 generic control rules are generally developed and optimised based on their relative performance on a range of design events li 2020 meneses et al 2018 shishegar et al 2018 shishegar et al 2019 these generic rule based controls generally translate storage levels or rainfall information into outlet control strategies therefore requiring these levels to be measured during rainfall events the control rules can either be static chang et al 2014 muschalla et al 2014 sadler et al 2020 or improved over time using approaches such as reinforcement learning mullapudi et al 2020 for predictive control lund et al 2018 control strategies that minimise peak system outflow are generally developed based on the forecast temporal distribution of the incoming rainfall event using optimisation algorithms di matteo et al 2019 liang et al 2019 the advantage of predictive control is that it is likely to achieve greater peak flow reductions as control strategies are tailored to individual rainfall events however its disadvantage is that it is more difficult to implement in practice as it requires a priori knowledge of the temporal distribution of the impending rainfall event di matteo et al 2019 liang et al 2019 in contrast reactive control is relatively easy to apply as it only requires real time storage water levels or rainfall depths which are relatively simple to measure chang et al 2014 li 2020 mullapudi et al 2018 when applied at the catchment scale the overall effectiveness of any rtc approach is likely to be affected by the volume and location of the storage s to which it is applied this is confirmed by studies that have used formal optimisation approaches to determine the locations and volumes of distributed storages to maximise their effectiveness artita et al 2013 cimorelli et al 2016 cunha et al 2016 leitão et al 2018 ngamalieu nengoue et al 2019 oxley and mays 2014 yang et al 2019 however these studies did not use rtc in contrast the influence of the number locations and volumes of storages on peak flow reduction has generally been ignored in studies that have utilised rtc these studies have generally focused on testing the proposed scheme on single storage li 2020 shen et al 2020 shishegar et al 2019 hypothetical systems of storages with pre determined volumes and locations di matteo et al 2019 maiolo et al 2020 sadler et al 2019 or real storage systems with pre determined volumes and locations bilodeau et al 2018 kerkez et al 2016 mullapudi et al 2018 muschalla et al 2014 sadler et al 2020 this makes it difficult to assess the absolute and relative impact of the combination of using storages and rtc at the catchment scale in order to address this shortcoming the objectives of this paper are 1 to introduce a two step approach to minimising peak flow at the catchment scale by firstly optimising the volumes and locations of distributed storages and then optimising the rtc for a given rainfall event 2 to test the effectiveness of the above approach including the relative impact of each of its two steps on a real catchment in adelaide south australia compared with the more commonly used end of system storage 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual approach the proposed approach to reducing peak flows consists of a two step process fig 1 outlined as follows step 1 optimisation of the layout locations and volumes of distributed storages to minimise system peak flow rate at the location of interest while minimising total system storage volume details of formal optimisation are described in section 2 2 step 2 optimisation of the rtc of the outlets of the storages that form part of the optimal layout identified in step 1 to further minimise system peak flow rate at the location of interest details of formal optimisation are described in section 2 3 both steps 1 and 2 enable system peak flows to be reduced by attenuating and or delaying the peaks of hydrographs from contributing sub catchments as illustrated in fig 2 which provides a conceptual comparison of the impact of the different scenarios no storage distributed storage and distributed storage with rtc on peak flows fig 2 a provides a baseline scenario with no storage and shows that when peak flows from individual sub catchments are coincident they can combine to provide a larger system peak flow in contrast fig 2 b shows that when storages are added to one or more sub catchments the hydrographs from individual sub catchments can be attenuated and their timing changed to reduce their degree of coincidence which provides an opportunity to reduce downstream peak flows in a realistic catchment there are two key challenges to achieving this outcome 1 the degree to which different combinations of storage locations and volumes are able to reduce peak flows is catchment dependent and 2 there is a very large number of potential combinations of storage volumes and locations to be evaluated in order to overcome these two challenges a formal optimisation approach is required to identify the storage layout storage locations and volumes that minimises peak flows this approach is termed distributed storage with optimised layout distrib storage layout for the remainder of the paper the addition of real time control rtc to the outlets of these distributed storages provides an opportunity to further reduce peak flows by adjusting how much water is held in and released from the storages at different times during a rainfall event fig 2 c again as the number of options for controlling these outlets is extremely large e g timing and magnitudes of changes in storage outflows a formal optimisation approach is needed to achieve maximum peak flow reductions this approach is termed distributed storage with optimised layout and control distrib storage rtc for the remainder of the paper 2 2 optimisation of distributed storage layout locations and volumes step 1 this section outlines the formal optimisation technique used to identify the optimal layouts of distributed storage systems to reduce system peak flows as outlined in fig 1a a optimisation problem formulation when determining the layout of distributed storages for the purpose of reducing system peak flows the locations li and volumes vi of n potential storages are the decision variables dvs of the formal optimisation problem 1 dv l 1 l 2 l n v 1 v 2 v n the selection of potential storage locations li can be represented as a binary variable 0 if the location is not selected and 1 if the location is selected for unselected storage locations storage volumes will be assigned a value of 0 for selected storage locations storage volumes will be assigned values that minimise system peak flows as part of the optimisation process the optimisation objective is to identify the locations and volumes of the distributed storages that minimise the system peak flow rate at the outlet of the stormwater system max q system with the smallest combined system storage volume at the n potential storage locations v total fig 1a 2 minimize max q system v total where 3 v total i 1 n l i v i the constraints include the potential storage locations and volumes as well as the need to satisfy basic hydraulic and hydrologic requirements b simulation optimisation process in order to solve the optimisation problem defined above a simulation optimisation approach is used fig 3 as part of this process initial values of the decision variables i e the storage layouts are either selected at random or based on domain knowledge bi et al 2015 newland et al 2020 generally a number of different combinations of decision variables i e different layouts see fig 3 are selected which are referred to as a population of solutions maier et al 2019 the possible locations at which storages can be placed as well as the volumes these storages can take are part of the constraints of the optimisation problem fig 1a and are accounted for implicitly by the values that the decision variables are allowed to take next the system peak outflow rate for each of these layouts is calculated ideally for multiple design storm temporal patterns based on local guidelines for an annual exceedance probability aep and duration with the aid of an appropriate stormwater simulation model e g stormwater management model gironás et al 2010 the average system peak flow over these storm events max q system is then calculated together with the total system storage volume v total enabling the two objective functions eq 2 fig 1a to be calculated fig 3 the use of a simulation model ensures that any hydraulic or hydrological constraints fig 1a are accounted for these objective function values are used to update the decision variable values with the aid of the evolutionary algorithm ea to produce storage layouts that result in better objective function values by using a number of operators such as selection cross over and mutation maier et al 2014 maier et al 2019 various eas use different operators wang et al 2020 which generally have to be tuned to the problem at hand in order to achieve an appropriate balance between exploring the space of potential solutions widely in order to identify the best possible solution and converging to the optimal solution as quickly as possible maier et al 2019 although some algorithms use self adaptive parameters e g zheng et al 2017 in the above simulation optimisation cycle the goodness of the layouts of the storages selected by the optimisation algorithm i e the ea is evaluated with the aid of the simulation model via the objective function values this then feeds into the determination of the next set of storage layouts with the aid of the optimisation algorithm this simulation optimisation cycle is repeated a large number of times i e for a large number of generations until certain stopping criteria have been met such as the completion of a certain number of pre defined generations or until there is no further improvement in the objectives 2 3 optimisation of rtc of distributed storages step 2 this section outlines the formal optimisation approach used to identify the optimal rtc strategies for a given optimised distributed storage layout that are able to achieve the greatest reductions in peak flows liang et al 2019 as outlined in fig 1b a optimisation problem formulation for rtc during rainfall events of the outlets of distributed storages for the purpose of reducing system peak flows the percentage opening of the outlet orifice o s t for each storage s at each control time step t are the decision variables dvs of the formal optimisation problem 4 dv s o 1 0 o 1 t o 1 m o s 0 o s t o s m o n 0 o n t o n m where the degree of orifice opening ranges from 0 fully closed to 100 fully open s 1 2 n and t 0 1 m the optimisation objective is to identify the control strategy that minimises system peak flow rate at the outlet of the stormwater system max q system for a given optimised storage layout fig 1b 5 m i n i m i z e m a x q system the constraints include the maximum orifice size the potential percentage opening of the orifice at each storage and the potential timing of changes in the degree of the opening of the orifice at each storage as well as the need to satisfy basic hydraulic and hydrologic requirements fig 1b b simulation optimisation process similar to step 1 a simulation optimisation approach using an ea is used for solving the problem of determining the optimal rtc strategy fig 4 in this instance the ea selects a population of solutions that correspond to different values of the percentage opening of each of the storage outlets at each of the control time steps for the optimised layout selected in step 1 fig 1b eq 4 the maximum orifice size the potential percentage openings of the outlet orifices and the time steps at which these changes in percentage orifice openings can be made are part of the constraints of the optimisation problem fig 1b and are accounted for implicitly by the values the decision variables are allowed to take the maximum system peak flow that corresponds to the selected population of rtc strategies is then calculated for the storm event for which the optimal control scheme is being developed with the aid of a stormwater simulation model it should be noted that this requires knowledge of the temporal rainfall distribution of the storm event di matteo et al 2019 the use of a simulation model ensures that any hydraulic or hydrological constraints fig 1b are accounted for based on the values of maximum system outflow max q system obtained the values of the decision variables i e rtc strategies eq 4 are adjusted iteratively over a number of generations with the aid of the ea operators selection cross over and mutation to minimise the objective function i e peak system outflow eq 5 until the pre defined stopping criteria are met 3 case study and experimental methods 3 1 system configuration the case study used to demonstrate the proposed approach is an inner city urban catchment in adelaide south australia fig 5 the catchment has a history of urban infill development resulting in local flooding in response costly major pipe upgrades have been proposed an alternative and potentially more cost effective approach to addressing the flooding issues is to use the approach introduced in section 2 this includes the use of optimised distributed storages and their optimal rtc to reduce peak system outflows the total catchment area for this case study is around 36 ha and the land use is mostly medium density residential the topography of the catchment is shown in fig 5 using 5 m contour lines the catchment generally falls from southeast to northwest with the stormwater flow path gradient ranging from 0 5 to 2 the location where flooding problems occur is marked as the system outfall eight potential locations for the stormwater storages were determined in consultation with local government engineers dealing with the flooding issues and are shown in fig 5 3 2 computational experiments in order to test the effectiveness of the proposed distributed storage with optimised layout step 1 and the distributed storage with optimised layout and control step 2 approaches three computational experiments are conducted as summarised in fig 6 for experiment 1 the optimal trade off between storage volume and peak flow is determined for an end of system storage eos as a benchmark against which the relative effectiveness of the two step approach section 2 introduced in this paper is assessed in experiment 2 the benefit of using distributed storage with optimised layout step 1 is assessed by identifying optimal trade offs between system storage volume and peak flow and comparing it to the end of system storage experiment 1 experiment 3 assesses the additional benefit achieved by adding optimal rtc to selected optimised layouts step 2 by comparing the results to the optimal trade off curve from experiment 2 3 2 1 rainfall and peak flow characteristics common to all experiments an aep of 10 is used to determine the design rainfall from australian rainfall and runoff 2019 arr 2019 ball et al 2019 for all experiments fig 6 as the minor stormwater system pipe and kerb flow at the case study site is required to have the capacity to convey runoff for this storm frequency in addition all experiments are conducted using the ten recommended storm temporal patterns in arr 2019 as storm temporal patterns can significantly influence peak flow in order to assess the effectiveness of the different approaches to reducing peak flow tested in the three experiments the average peak flows resulting from the ten storm patterns were used as recommended in arr 2019 ball et al 2019 consequently for the remainder of this paper peak flows refers to the average peak flows of ten temporal storm patterns it should be noted that a zero initial loss is assumed for the storm events which ensures that all peak flows can be compared directly 3 2 2 experiment 1 end of system storage in order to determine the critical storm duration of the catchment which is the duration that produces the biggest peak flow and how this varies with the addition of storage three storm durations 20 25 and 45 min were tested for the end of system eos storage the decision variables for the eos storage optimisation runs include the storage volume and outlet orifice diameter the largest possible outlet diameter is set to 525 mm which is equal to the connected pipe diameter the eos storage is placed at location 8 at the end of the stormwater system fig 5 the objectives of the eos storage optimisation are to minimise i stormwater system peak flows and ii volume of eos storage hypervolume convergence was used as the stopping criterion as part of which the optimisation run stops when the hypervolume beume et al 2007 of the solutions that provide the optimal trade off between the two objectives i e the pareto front van veldhuizen and lamont 1998 does not change by more than 0 01 for ten successive generations based on the results of the optimisation runs the single critical duration that provided the highest peak flow is determined and used for experiments 2 and 3 fig 6 3 2 3 experiment 2 distributed storage with optimised layout step 1 this experiment uses the single critical duration determined from experiment 1 as discussed in section 2 2 the decision variables for the distributed storage layout optimisation include storage locations and volumes eight potential locations for the storages fig 5 are considered and the maximum volume for each of these is set to 1000 m3 based on site constraints the storages are modelled as street scale in line storages which are connected to the existing stormwater pipelines with the underground in line storage height set at 1 2 m it should be noted that the largest possible orifice sizes are the same as the diameter of the pipes to which they are connected either 450 mm or 525 mm similar to experiment 1 hypervolume convergence was used as the stopping criterion for the optimisation runs the output from this experiment is the trade off curve between system storage volume and peak flow 3 2 4 experiment 3 distributed storage with optimised layout and control step 2 the aim of this experiment is to determine the additional benefits of optimising the rtc of distributed storages for a range of selected optimised layouts this experiment uses the single critical duration determined from experiment 1 and selected optimal layouts from experiment 2 which corresponded to different system storage volumes ranging from 100 m3 to 1000 m3 in 100 m3 increments i e 100 m3 200 900 1000 m3 the decision variables for the optimisation of the rtc include the percentage opening of the storage outlet orifices and the time step at which such changes will be made the available percentage openings included 0 fully closed 1 2 and 100 fully open and the control time step was 5 minutes as there was only a single objective i e to minimise peak flow objective function convergence was used as the stopping criterion where the optimisation run stops when the peak flow does not change by more than 0 01l s over ten successive generations of the ea 3 3 performance assessment system peak flow reduction was used as the measure for assessing the performance of experiments 1 to 3 which corresponds to the change in peak flow at the outlet of the catchment from a no storage scenario baseline i e a stormwater system without any storage see fig 2 a consequently the peak flow reduction for an experiment is given by 6 s y s t e m pe a k fl o w re d u c t i o n 1 max q system i max q system baseline 100 where max q system i is the peak flow of a specific experiment and max q system baseline is the peak flow of the no storage scenario 3 4 implementation of simulation optimisation approach in order to implement the two simulation optimisation approaches presented in sections 2 2 and 2 3 as well as the end of system optimisation runs described in section 3 2 a software linking two python packages one for optimisation and one for simulation was developed the two constituent python packages include i deap distributed evolutionary algorithms in python developed by the computer vision and systems laboratory at université laval in quebec city canada fortin et al 2012 which was used as the optimisation package and ii pyswmm python wrapper for stormwater management model developed by emnet llc in south bend usa which was used together with swmm as the stormwater simulation package deap v2 1 is a python package that applies evolutionary algorithms to solve real world problems the package

objective variants of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsgaii deb et al 2002 algorithm in the deap package were used to select the decision variables for the optimisation problems formulated in sections 2 2 and 2 3 respectively nsgaii variants have been used successfully to solve urban stormwater optimisation problems previously di matteo et al 2017 di matteo et al 2019 paseka

input the decision variables storage volumes locations and control strategies into the stormwater management model swmm 4 results 4 1 performance of end of system eos storage 4 1 1 overview of results optimal trade off curve fig 7 a shows the optimal trade off curve of system peak flow versus system storage volume for the eos storage for the three storm durations considered i e 20 min 25 min and 45 min experiment 1 fig 6 as can be seen the critical duration depends on the system storage for system storage of less than 900 m3 a storm duration of 25 min is the critical duration as it provides the highest peak flow however when the system storage is larger than 900 m3 a storm duration of 45 min produces a higher peak flow and thus becomes critical as demonstrated by the crossover point between the yellow and orange lines in fig 7 a given that a duration of 25 min is critical for a wide range of storages i e all storage volumes up to 900 m3 this duration is used for experiments 2 and 3 as described in section 3 2 4 1 2 analysis of results flood hydrograph of a typical event the optimal trade off curve in fig 7 a shows that at least 650 m3 of storage is required before any reductions in peak flow occur for the critical 25 min storm duration when a single eos storage is used the reasons for this are shown by the flood hydrograph and time series of storage level for a storage volume of 580 m3 in fig 7 b the eos storage does not have sufficient detention capacity to produce a peak flow reduction analysis of the flow with no storage scenario black dotted line fig 7 b shows that the peak flow occurs at t 35 mins the eos storage fills early in the storm t 28 mins orange line fig 7 b before the peak flow occurs at t 35 mins blue line fig 7 b prior to filling the eos storage is able to reduce the flow blue line fig 7 b t 28 mins however once the eos storage is full no reduction in flow occurs and the flow blue line fig 7 b t 28 mins is similar to the one with no storage black dotted line fig 7 b t 28 mins this means for the eos storage scenario a storage volume larger than 650 m3 will be required to achieve meaningful peak flow reduction this size of storage is likely to have practical implications regarding space availability as discussed in section 5 3 4 2 performance of distributed storage with optimised layout and real time control 4 2 1 overview of results optimal trade off curve fig 8 shows that the use of distributed storage with optimised layouts experiment 2 results in significant peak flow reductions these range from 5 for a 100 m3 system storage volume to 52 for a 900 m3 system storage volume this is in contrast to the single eos storage experiment 1 which did not result in any peak flow reduction for storage volumes less than 650 m3 even when the system storage volume is increased from 650 m3 to 900 m3 the resulting maximum peak flow reduction for the single eos storage is only 8 fig 8 this highlights that distributed storages with optimised layouts have far greater potential for reducing peak flows in stormwater systems compared with the use of eos storages optimal real time control distrib storage rtc experiment 3 is able to further improve the performance of the optimised distributed storage system with approximately an additional 10 reduction in the peak flow compared to the no storage scenario fig 8 this improvement is significant when there is a relatively small system storage volume for example for a system storage volume of 100 m3 the distrib storage layout scenario experiment 2 is only able to achieve a 4 peak flow reduction however the addition of real time smart control experiment 3 is able to increase this value to 14 which corresponds to a 2 5 times increase the addition of optimal real time control also has the potential to significantly reduce the system storage volume required to achieve a target peak flow reduction for example if the target peak flow reduction was 39 the distrib storage layout scenario without real time control would require a storage volume of around 700 m3 experiment 2 fig 8 red line however with the addition of real time control experiment 3 the system storage volume required to achieve the same target peak flow reduction reduces from 700 m3 to only 400 m3 red line fig 8 this corresponds to a 43 reduction in the required system storage volume 4 2 2 analysis of results flood hydrographs at system outfall and storage layouts for typical cases this section examines the flood hydrographs at the system outfall and optimised storage locations for a series of typical cases to assist with understanding the mechanisms that result in the simulated peak flow reductions this will be complemented by an examination of the flood hydrographs from internal catchment locations in the following section section 4 2 3 fig 9 compares the hydrograph for a single storm event storm temporal pattern 4 at the system outfall for the baseline and three different typical cases as defined previously the baseline case is the no storage scenario typical cases 1 and 2 are for the distributed storage with optimised layout distrib storage layout scenario with system storage volumes of 200 m3 and 800 m3 respectively and will be described below the third typical case is for the distributed storage with optimised layout and control distrib storage rtc scenario with a system storage volume of 200 m3 fig 10 shows the corresponding optimised layouts storage volumes and the percentage contributing catchment areas for each of the optimised storage locations and volumes typical case 1 distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume for the first typical case the flood hydrographs fig 9 show that a system storage volume of 200 m3 results in a peak flow reduction from 1 978 lps no storage scenario to 1 620 lps distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume fig 9 the hydrograph for the no storage scenario has a single peak at 1 978lps t 34 min while the hydrograph for the distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume scenario has two peaks at 1 480lps t 28 min and 1 620lps t 36 min respectively fig 10 shows that the optimised layout to achieve this is a single storage of 200 m3 at location 5 which regulates flow from 59 of the catchment typical case 2 distrib storage layout 800 m3 storage volume for the second typical case for which the system storage volume is 800 m3 the system peak flow is reduced from 1 978 lps no storage scenario to 1 000 lps distrib storage layout 800 m3 storage volume fig 9 the hydrograph for the distrib storage layout 800 m3 storage volume scenario has two peaks with the first occurring at t 32 min with a value of 840lps the second 1 000lps peak lasts around 8 mins from t 40 min to t 48 min similar to the first typical case the optimised layout still includes a storage at location 5 but there is an additional storage at location 7 fig 10 the optimal volumes of the storages at locations 5 and 7 are 298 m3 and 502 m3 respectively typical case 3 distrib storage rtc 200 m3 storage volume this typical case corresponds to the application of real time control to the optimised layout described in the first typical case distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume and therefore consists of a single storage of 200 m3 at location 5 by applying a real time smart control strategy to this storage the system peak flow is reduced further from 1 620 l s distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume fig 9 to 1 480 l s distrib storage rtc 200 m3 storage volume fig 9 the hydrograph for the distrib storage rtc 200 m3 storage volume case similar to that for the distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume case also has two peaks with the first peak t 28 min unchanged the second peak t 36 min is reduced from 1 620 l s to 1 480 l s resulting in an overall reduction in peak flow 4 2 3 analysis of results flood hydrographs at multiple catchment locations for typical cases fig 11 shows the hydrographs at internal catchment locations for the baseline and three typical cases are shown in fig 9 in order to illustrate the mechanisms that enable the distributed storages to reduce peak flow the hydrographs of the following three different kinds of flow at multiple catchment locations are given 1 the total flow at the system outfall location 3 fig 10 2 the regulated flow which is contributed to by catchments upstream of the storage location location 1 or 2 fig 10 and 3 the non regulated flow which is contributed to by catchments downstream of the storage location location 1 or 2 fig 10 baseline no storage scenario the hydrographs for the no storage scenario are given in fig 11 a the total flow at the system outfall has a peak of 1 978l s yellow line fig 11 a which is a coincident peak resulting from the falling limb of the non regulated flow blue line fig 11 a and the peak of the regulated flow green line fig 11 a typical case 1 distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume fig 11 b illustrates the hydrographs resulting from using a 200 m3 distributed storage to reduce the total peak flow compared with that obtained using the no storage scenario the primary mechanism responsible for the reduction in peak flow by the addition of the single 200 m3 storage at location 5 appears to be a delay of the regulated flow resulting from the catchments upstream of location 1 corresponding to 59 of the total catchment area the peak regulated flow of the no storage scenario occurs at t 33 min green dashed line fig 11 b while for the distrib storage layout scenario this flow is delayed by 5 min to t 38 min with the aid of the storage solid green line fig 11 b as a result the original total flow hydrograph yellow dashed line fig 11 b is modified to a double peak solid yellow line fig 11 b where the first peak primarily corresponds to the non regulated flow from the 41 of sub catchment areas that is not delayed and the second peak primarily to the regulated flow from the 59 of sub catchment areas that is delayed by the 200 m3 storage at location 5 fig 10 typical case 2 distrib storage layout 800 m3 storage volume fig 11 c illustrates the hydrographs resulting from using 800 m3 of distributed storage to reduce the total peak flow compared with using 200 m3 when the system storage is increased from 200 m3 to 800 m3 the peak flow reduction is due to two different mechanisms the first is the offsetting of the hydrographs from different sub catchments via the storage at location 5 similar to the case when the system storage volume is 200 m3 which is evidenced by the double peak in the system outfall hydrograph solid yellow line fig 11 c the second is the delay and attenuation of the hydrograph from the runoff from the majority of the catchment 91 fig 10 b as it passes through the larger 502 m3 storage at location 7 green dashed line and green solid line fig 11 c which further delays the peak of the regulated flow from t 36 m to t 44 min so that it is fully offset from the non regulated flow blue line fig 11 c as a result the peak of the total flow at the system outfall solid yellow line fig 11 c is only contributed to by the regulated flow solid green line fig 11 c resulting in a significant reduction in peak flow at the system outfall typical case 3 distrib storage rtc scenario 200 m3 storage volume fig 12 shows the hydrographs of using 200 m3 distributed storage with rtc compared with the case of using the same storages without any control fig 12 a and the corresponding storage levels and orifice opening percentages fig 12 b for the case without any control the total flow hydrograph has two peaks yellow dashed line fig 12 a the first of these 1 480l s t 28 min is mainly caused by the non regulated flow blue line fig 12 a while the second 1 620l s t 36 min is mainly caused by the regulated flow green dashed line fig 12 a for the case with rtc the rising limb and peak of the regulated flow are attenuated t 28 42 min solid green line fig 12 a by the orifice being fully closed from t 26 min to t 35 min fig 12 b as a result the second peak in the total flow hydrograph solid yellow line fig 12 a is reduced to around 1 480l s which is similar to the magnitude of the first peak there is no need for the rtc to reduce the second peak further as the first peak is now the dominant peak of the total flow hydrograph it should be noted that the storage is full at t 28 min fig 12 b and thus the storage volume is not large enough to deal with both the first and second peaks consequently the optimisation algorithm was able to identify the most efficient rtc strategy which is to reduce the magnitude of the second peak of the total flow hydrograph to be just less than the first peak 5 discussion 5 1 summary of key mechanisms for peak flow reduction the results indicate that by distributing storages at strategic locations throughout a catchment and optimising their volumes system peak outflows can be reduced this occurs by staggering the peak inflows from different sub catchments thereby reducing the coincidence of peaks at the confluence of different sub catchments delaying and attenuating hydrographs as they pass through the storages by adding optimised control to the optimised layouts of the distributed storage the outflow of the storages can be regulated in a way that further reduces peak flows by utilizing available storage capacity to delay and reduce the runoff peaks from specific sub catchments to avoid large coincident peaks therefore the timing and degree of the outlet operations offer the potential for further peak flow reductions these conclusions build on the results of cunha et al cunha et al 2016 who found that by adding storage units to stormwater systems at optimal locations allows for integrated flow control and hence peak flow reduction throughout the system 5 2 advantages of separating the impacts of optimised layout and rtc to the authors knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of optimising both the locations and volumes of storages as well as their rtc strategy previous studies that focus on testing various rtc schemes on storage s using pre determined volume s di matteo et al 2019 maiolo et al 2020 sadler et al 2019 shen et al 2020 are not able to show the relative effectiveness of layout versus rtc approaches at the catchment scale as the results only show the combined impact of the layout and the rtc this study has decoupled this combined effect into its constituent components with the results illustrating that rtc is more beneficial for smaller systems storage volumes for example as discussed in section 4 2 1 there is a 250 relative increase in performance when rtc is added to storages with optimised location and volume when the system storage volume is only 100 m3 due to its high computational cost the simulation optimisation approaches for layout and rtc are conducted sequentially in this study a limitation of this approach is that as the optimised storage locations and volumes are determined prior to the optimisation of the rtc strategy the optimal combined strategy might not have been identified there may be opportunities to achieve better performance by optimising the storage layouts and rtc strategies simultaneously as has been shown to be the case for the joint optimisation of design and dispatch for wind diesel systems garcia and weisser 2006 design and operation of water distribution systems stokes et al 2016 and water energy systems giudici et al 2019 maintenance and buffer sizes in manufacturing systems ribeiro et al 2007 and production rate and preventive maintenance in machining systems cheng et al 2016 5 3 practical benefits of optimising layout of distributed storages the practical benefits of the approach developed in this study to identify optimal trade offs between system storage volume and the corresponding peak flow reduction are as follows for real complex catchment systems similar to the case study the size of the search space is extremely large it is highly unlikely that even near optimal solutions could be found using a manual trial and error design process maier et al 2019 in addition a manual approach would not make it possible to generate optimal trade offs which have been shown to aid decision making processes in a number of related problem domains dandy and engelhardt 2006 di matteo et al 2019 newland et al 2020 newman et al 2014 wang et al 2020 end of system storages usually require a large storage volume to achieve meaningful peak flow reduction however due to space availability this is not always feasible myers 2019 the use of distributed storages not only requires a smaller system storage volume but the distributed nature of the storages means that the storage volume required at a particular location is generally relatively small making them significantly easier to implement from a practical perspective distributed storages with optimised layout can be implemented with current technology providing a practically viable alternative to upgrading existing stormwater conveyance systems potentially avoiding major investments the relative advantage of optimised distributed storages is likely to increase i if peak flow reductions can be achieved further upstream as this reduces the need to upgrade any stormwater conveyance infrastructure downstream of this location and ii with the length of stormwater conveyance infrastructure that would require upgrading if peak flows were not reduced 5 4 practical benefits and challenges of optimising rtc of distributed storages with further development in control and rainfall forecasting technologies it is likely that it will become practical to reliably add optimised rtc to distributed storage systems as an adaptive strategy to deal with increases in stormwater runoff due to factors such as climate change population growth and urbanisation in addition with the aid of rtc distributed storage systems are able to achieve multiple benefits in addition to flood mitigation including water quality improvement and stormwater harvesting campisano et al 2017 dandy et al 2019 di matteo et al 2019 muschalla et al 2014 shen et al 2020 this is achieved by equipping distributed storages with low cost sensors and controllers that allow water levels to be monitored and the release of water to be automatically controlled for different objectives for example the outlet of distributed storages could be kept closed during non flooding events and the stored stormwater runoff used for environmental purposes including watering green public space and keeping biofilters alive shen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 however given that the case study presented in this paper is one of a real world system and that significant peak flow reductions were observed simply by adding distributed storages of optimal volumes in optimal locations the first step of the proposed two step approach provides a practical option for reducing peak flows rtc can be added at a later date in order to increase system robustness mcphail et al 2021 and provide adaptive capacity if this is found to be required based on system stress tests such as those associated with climate change bennett et al 2021 culley et al 2021 5 5 future research future research that can be undertaken to increase the performance and practicality of the proposed simulation optimisation approaches includes 1 the development of rtc schemes based on known information of storage levels and or flows in the stormwater system in addition to or in lieu of the use of rainfall forecasts as is the case in this study 2 identification of potential trade offs between system cost and peak flow reductions in this study system storage volume was used as a surrogate for total cost 3 developing and testing an optimisation framework that optimises storage layouts and rtc schemes simultaneously 4 testing the proposed rtc approach as part of physical experiments on a real or laboratory based system and 5 using a stormwater simulation model that is calibrated to observed data from a case study catchment utilising techniques that incorporate the multiple sources of predictive uncertainty in the rainfall runoff model mcinerney et al 2020 mcinerney et al 2017 6 conclusions this study demonstrates that distributed storage with optimised layout and distributed storage with optimised layout and control can significantly reduce peak outflows from stormwater systems and are more effective than the use of end of system storage for the 36 ha catchment case study an end of system storage was not able to achieve significant peak flow reductions when the system storage volume was smaller than 690 m3 in contrast distributed storage with optimised layouts was able to achieve significant peak flow reduction ranging from 5 for a 100 m3 storage volume to 40 for a storage volume of 700 m3 the addition of optimised real time control was able to achieve a further 10 reduction which is more significant for smaller system storage volumes for example with the same 100 m3 optimised distributed storage the addition of real time control is able to increase peak flow reduction from 4 to 14 analysis of the flood hydrographs shows these reductions are achieved by attenuating stormwater hydrographs at individual storages as well as delaying hydrographs to reduce their coincidence at the confluence of sub catchments thereby reducing system peak outflows the formal optimisation of the locations and volumes of distributed storages provides a practical solution to mitigating increasing stormwater system outflows as it can generally be accommodated easily within existing systems due to the relatively small volume of individual storages real time control of storages which requires some technological developments provides opportunities to adapt to further increases in peak outflows due to climate change

4242,the impact of urban flooding is increasing due to the effects of increasing urbanisation and climate change the use of storages is a relatively well established approach to reduce peak flows and therefore reduce the need for costly upgrades to stormwater conveyance infrastructure recently real time control rtc has been considered as a means of increasing the performance of these storages however previous rtc studies have generally focussed on evaluating rtc with pre determined storage layouts i e storage locations and volumes and have ignored the impact of optimising the storage layout hence the objectives of this paper are i to introduce a two step approach to minimising peak flows at the catchment scale by firstly optimising the layout of distributed storages and then optimising their rtc strategies and ii to test the effectiveness of this approach on a real catchment in adelaide south australia results show that distributed storage with optimised layouts can achieve significantly higher peak flow reductions than more commonly used end of system storage these range from 5 for 100 m3 of system storage up to 40 for 700 m3 of system storage whereas end of system storage achieved no peak flow reduction for up to 700 m3 of storage the addition of optimised rtc to distributed storages is able to achieve an additional 10 in peak flow reduction this increase in performance due to rtc is more significant for smaller system storage volumes analysis of the flood hydrographs shows the system peak flow reductions are achieved by attenuating hydrographs at individual storages as well as delaying hydrographs to reduce their coincidence at the confluence of sub catchments these results highlight the potential for using optimised distributed storage layout and rtc as an alternative approach to end of system storage to reduce flood peaks keywords stormwater management real time control urban flooding simulation optimisation genetic algorithms 1 introduction urban flooding and its impacts are increasing as a result of increasing urbanization densification locatelli et al 2017 van der bruggen et al 2010 and climate change pandey et al 2003 increasing urbanization densification is likely to result in an increase in impervious areas reducing infiltration and evapotranspiration rates li et al li et al 2017 and increasing peak flows burns et al 2012 at the same time climate change is likely to cause an increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme climate events including extreme storm events with very high rainfall intensity razavi et al 2020 which is predicted to further increase peak flows in stormwater systems sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2015 historically the way to deal with increasing peak flows has been to increase the capacity of stormwater conveyance systems booth et al 2004 walsh et al 2015 however this is likely to be costly and disruptive and might not be physically feasible in some instances due to the proximity of other services burns et al 2012 fletcher et al 2014 li et al 2017 poff et al 1997 richter et al 1997 an alternative to increasing the capacity of stormwater conveyance systems is to reduce system peak flow recently the real time control rtc of stormwater storage outlets has been considered as an effective way to achieve this berglund et al 2020 campisano et al 2017 shishegar et al 2018 for the purposes of flood mitigation the simplest rtc approach is to empty storages prior to impending storm events to maximise available storage campisano et al 2017 schubert et al 2017 xu et al 2020 xu et al 2018 however this approach has been shown to be ineffective for rainfall events for which runoff volume exceeds system storage volume di matteo et al 2019 liang et al 2019 schubert et al 2017 in order to deal with this shortcoming a number of studies have used rtc during storm events ibrahim 2020 li 2020 lund et al 2020 mullapudi et al 2020 sadler et al 2020 schütze et al 2002 which can be broadly grouped into two categories reactive control and predictive control for reactive control lund et al 2018 generic control rules are generally developed and optimised based on their relative performance on a range of design events li 2020 meneses et al 2018 shishegar et al 2018 shishegar et al 2019 these generic rule based controls generally translate storage levels or rainfall information into outlet control strategies therefore requiring these levels to be measured during rainfall events the control rules can either be static chang et al 2014 muschalla et al 2014 sadler et al 2020 or improved over time using approaches such as reinforcement learning mullapudi et al 2020 for predictive control lund et al 2018 control strategies that minimise peak system outflow are generally developed based on the forecast temporal distribution of the incoming rainfall event using optimisation algorithms di matteo et al 2019 liang et al 2019 the advantage of predictive control is that it is likely to achieve greater peak flow reductions as control strategies are tailored to individual rainfall events however its disadvantage is that it is more difficult to implement in practice as it requires a priori knowledge of the temporal distribution of the impending rainfall event di matteo et al 2019 liang et al 2019 in contrast reactive control is relatively easy to apply as it only requires real time storage water levels or rainfall depths which are relatively simple to measure chang et al 2014 li 2020 mullapudi et al 2018 when applied at the catchment scale the overall effectiveness of any rtc approach is likely to be affected by the volume and location of the storage s to which it is applied this is confirmed by studies that have used formal optimisation approaches to determine the locations and volumes of distributed storages to maximise their effectiveness artita et al 2013 cimorelli et al 2016 cunha et al 2016 leitão et al 2018 ngamalieu nengoue et al 2019 oxley and mays 2014 yang et al 2019 however these studies did not use rtc in contrast the influence of the number locations and volumes of storages on peak flow reduction has generally been ignored in studies that have utilised rtc these studies have generally focused on testing the proposed scheme on single storage li 2020 shen et al 2020 shishegar et al 2019 hypothetical systems of storages with pre determined volumes and locations di matteo et al 2019 maiolo et al 2020 sadler et al 2019 or real storage systems with pre determined volumes and locations bilodeau et al 2018 kerkez et al 2016 mullapudi et al 2018 muschalla et al 2014 sadler et al 2020 this makes it difficult to assess the absolute and relative impact of the combination of using storages and rtc at the catchment scale in order to address this shortcoming the objectives of this paper are 1 to introduce a two step approach to minimising peak flow at the catchment scale by firstly optimising the volumes and locations of distributed storages and then optimising the rtc for a given rainfall event 2 to test the effectiveness of the above approach including the relative impact of each of its two steps on a real catchment in adelaide south australia compared with the more commonly used end of system storage 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual approach the proposed approach to reducing peak flows consists of a two step process fig 1 outlined as follows step 1 optimisation of the layout locations and volumes of distributed storages to minimise system peak flow rate at the location of interest while minimising total system storage volume details of formal optimisation are described in section 2 2 step 2 optimisation of the rtc of the outlets of the storages that form part of the optimal layout identified in step 1 to further minimise system peak flow rate at the location of interest details of formal optimisation are described in section 2 3 both steps 1 and 2 enable system peak flows to be reduced by attenuating and or delaying the peaks of hydrographs from contributing sub catchments as illustrated in fig 2 which provides a conceptual comparison of the impact of the different scenarios no storage distributed storage and distributed storage with rtc on peak flows fig 2 a provides a baseline scenario with no storage and shows that when peak flows from individual sub catchments are coincident they can combine to provide a larger system peak flow in contrast fig 2 b shows that when storages are added to one or more sub catchments the hydrographs from individual sub catchments can be attenuated and their timing changed to reduce their degree of coincidence which provides an opportunity to reduce downstream peak flows in a realistic catchment there are two key challenges to achieving this outcome 1 the degree to which different combinations of storage locations and volumes are able to reduce peak flows is catchment dependent and 2 there is a very large number of potential combinations of storage volumes and locations to be evaluated in order to overcome these two challenges a formal optimisation approach is required to identify the storage layout storage locations and volumes that minimises peak flows this approach is termed distributed storage with optimised layout distrib storage layout for the remainder of the paper the addition of real time control rtc to the outlets of these distributed storages provides an opportunity to further reduce peak flows by adjusting how much water is held in and released from the storages at different times during a rainfall event fig 2 c again as the number of options for controlling these outlets is extremely large e g timing and magnitudes of changes in storage outflows a formal optimisation approach is needed to achieve maximum peak flow reductions this approach is termed distributed storage with optimised layout and control distrib storage rtc for the remainder of the paper 2 2 optimisation of distributed storage layout locations and volumes step 1 this section outlines the formal optimisation technique used to identify the optimal layouts of distributed storage systems to reduce system peak flows as outlined in fig 1a a optimisation problem formulation when determining the layout of distributed storages for the purpose of reducing system peak flows the locations li and volumes vi of n potential storages are the decision variables dvs of the formal optimisation problem 1 dv l 1 l 2 l n v 1 v 2 v n the selection of potential storage locations li can be represented as a binary variable 0 if the location is not selected and 1 if the location is selected for unselected storage locations storage volumes will be assigned a value of 0 for selected storage locations storage volumes will be assigned values that minimise system peak flows as part of the optimisation process the optimisation objective is to identify the locations and volumes of the distributed storages that minimise the system peak flow rate at the outlet of the stormwater system max q system with the smallest combined system storage volume at the n potential storage locations v total fig 1a 2 minimize max q system v total where 3 v total i 1 n l i v i the constraints include the potential storage locations and volumes as well as the need to satisfy basic hydraulic and hydrologic requirements b simulation optimisation process in order to solve the optimisation problem defined above a simulation optimisation approach is used fig 3 as part of this process initial values of the decision variables i e the storage layouts are either selected at random or based on domain knowledge bi et al 2015 newland et al 2020 generally a number of different combinations of decision variables i e different layouts see fig 3 are selected which are referred to as a population of solutions maier et al 2019 the possible locations at which storages can be placed as well as the volumes these storages can take are part of the constraints of the optimisation problem fig 1a and are accounted for implicitly by the values that the decision variables are allowed to take next the system peak outflow rate for each of these layouts is calculated ideally for multiple design storm temporal patterns based on local guidelines for an annual exceedance probability aep and duration with the aid of an appropriate stormwater simulation model e g stormwater management model gironás et al 2010 the average system peak flow over these storm events max q system is then calculated together with the total system storage volume v total enabling the two objective functions eq 2 fig 1a to be calculated fig 3 the use of a simulation model ensures that any hydraulic or hydrological constraints fig 1a are accounted for these objective function values are used to update the decision variable values with the aid of the evolutionary algorithm ea to produce storage layouts that result in better objective function values by using a number of operators such as selection cross over and mutation maier et al 2014 maier et al 2019 various eas use different operators wang et al 2020 which generally have to be tuned to the problem at hand in order to achieve an appropriate balance between exploring the space of potential solutions widely in order to identify the best possible solution and converging to the optimal solution as quickly as possible maier et al 2019 although some algorithms use self adaptive parameters e g zheng et al 2017 in the above simulation optimisation cycle the goodness of the layouts of the storages selected by the optimisation algorithm i e the ea is evaluated with the aid of the simulation model via the objective function values this then feeds into the determination of the next set of storage layouts with the aid of the optimisation algorithm this simulation optimisation cycle is repeated a large number of times i e for a large number of generations until certain stopping criteria have been met such as the completion of a certain number of pre defined generations or until there is no further improvement in the objectives 2 3 optimisation of rtc of distributed storages step 2 this section outlines the formal optimisation approach used to identify the optimal rtc strategies for a given optimised distributed storage layout that are able to achieve the greatest reductions in peak flows liang et al 2019 as outlined in fig 1b a optimisation problem formulation for rtc during rainfall events of the outlets of distributed storages for the purpose of reducing system peak flows the percentage opening of the outlet orifice o s t for each storage s at each control time step t are the decision variables dvs of the formal optimisation problem 4 dv s o 1 0 o 1 t o 1 m o s 0 o s t o s m o n 0 o n t o n m where the degree of orifice opening ranges from 0 fully closed to 100 fully open s 1 2 n and t 0 1 m the optimisation objective is to identify the control strategy that minimises system peak flow rate at the outlet of the stormwater system max q system for a given optimised storage layout fig 1b 5 m i n i m i z e m a x q system the constraints include the maximum orifice size the potential percentage opening of the orifice at each storage and the potential timing of changes in the degree of the opening of the orifice at each storage as well as the need to satisfy basic hydraulic and hydrologic requirements fig 1b b simulation optimisation process similar to step 1 a simulation optimisation approach using an ea is used for solving the problem of determining the optimal rtc strategy fig 4 in this instance the ea selects a population of solutions that correspond to different values of the percentage opening of each of the storage outlets at each of the control time steps for the optimised layout selected in step 1 fig 1b eq 4 the maximum orifice size the potential percentage openings of the outlet orifices and the time steps at which these changes in percentage orifice openings can be made are part of the constraints of the optimisation problem fig 1b and are accounted for implicitly by the values the decision variables are allowed to take the maximum system peak flow that corresponds to the selected population of rtc strategies is then calculated for the storm event for which the optimal control scheme is being developed with the aid of a stormwater simulation model it should be noted that this requires knowledge of the temporal rainfall distribution of the storm event di matteo et al 2019 the use of a simulation model ensures that any hydraulic or hydrological constraints fig 1b are accounted for based on the values of maximum system outflow max q system obtained the values of the decision variables i e rtc strategies eq 4 are adjusted iteratively over a number of generations with the aid of the ea operators selection cross over and mutation to minimise the objective function i e peak system outflow eq 5 until the pre defined stopping criteria are met 3 case study and experimental methods 3 1 system configuration the case study used to demonstrate the proposed approach is an inner city urban catchment in adelaide south australia fig 5 the catchment has a history of urban infill development resulting in local flooding in response costly major pipe upgrades have been proposed an alternative and potentially more cost effective approach to addressing the flooding issues is to use the approach introduced in section 2 this includes the use of optimised distributed storages and their optimal rtc to reduce peak system outflows the total catchment area for this case study is around 36 ha and the land use is mostly medium density residential the topography of the catchment is shown in fig 5 using 5 m contour lines the catchment generally falls from southeast to northwest with the stormwater flow path gradient ranging from 0 5 to 2 the location where flooding problems occur is marked as the system outfall eight potential locations for the stormwater storages were determined in consultation with local government engineers dealing with the flooding issues and are shown in fig 5 3 2 computational experiments in order to test the effectiveness of the proposed distributed storage with optimised layout step 1 and the distributed storage with optimised layout and control step 2 approaches three computational experiments are conducted as summarised in fig 6 for experiment 1 the optimal trade off between storage volume and peak flow is determined for an end of system storage eos as a benchmark against which the relative effectiveness of the two step approach section 2 introduced in this paper is assessed in experiment 2 the benefit of using distributed storage with optimised layout step 1 is assessed by identifying optimal trade offs between system storage volume and peak flow and comparing it to the end of system storage experiment 1 experiment 3 assesses the additional benefit achieved by adding optimal rtc to selected optimised layouts step 2 by comparing the results to the optimal trade off curve from experiment 2 3 2 1 rainfall and peak flow characteristics common to all experiments an aep of 10 is used to determine the design rainfall from australian rainfall and runoff 2019 arr 2019 ball et al 2019 for all experiments fig 6 as the minor stormwater system pipe and kerb flow at the case study site is required to have the capacity to convey runoff for this storm frequency in addition all experiments are conducted using the ten recommended storm temporal patterns in arr 2019 as storm temporal patterns can significantly influence peak flow in order to assess the effectiveness of the different approaches to reducing peak flow tested in the three experiments the average peak flows resulting from the ten storm patterns were used as recommended in arr 2019 ball et al 2019 consequently for the remainder of this paper peak flows refers to the average peak flows of ten temporal storm patterns it should be noted that a zero initial loss is assumed for the storm events which ensures that all peak flows can be compared directly 3 2 2 experiment 1 end of system storage in order to determine the critical storm duration of the catchment which is the duration that produces the biggest peak flow and how this varies with the addition of storage three storm durations 20 25 and 45 min were tested for the end of system eos storage the decision variables for the eos storage optimisation runs include the storage volume and outlet orifice diameter the largest possible outlet diameter is set to 525 mm which is equal to the connected pipe diameter the eos storage is placed at location 8 at the end of the stormwater system fig 5 the objectives of the eos storage optimisation are to minimise i stormwater system peak flows and ii volume of eos storage hypervolume convergence was used as the stopping criterion as part of which the optimisation run stops when the hypervolume beume et al 2007 of the solutions that provide the optimal trade off between the two objectives i e the pareto front van veldhuizen and lamont 1998 does not change by more than 0 01 for ten successive generations based on the results of the optimisation runs the single critical duration that provided the highest peak flow is determined and used for experiments 2 and 3 fig 6 3 2 3 experiment 2 distributed storage with optimised layout step 1 this experiment uses the single critical duration determined from experiment 1 as discussed in section 2 2 the decision variables for the distributed storage layout optimisation include storage locations and volumes eight potential locations for the storages fig 5 are considered and the maximum volume for each of these is set to 1000 m3 based on site constraints the storages are modelled as street scale in line storages which are connected to the existing stormwater pipelines with the underground in line storage height set at 1 2 m it should be noted that the largest possible orifice sizes are the same as the diameter of the pipes to which they are connected either 450 mm or 525 mm similar to experiment 1 hypervolume convergence was used as the stopping criterion for the optimisation runs the output from this experiment is the trade off curve between system storage volume and peak flow 3 2 4 experiment 3 distributed storage with optimised layout and control step 2 the aim of this experiment is to determine the additional benefits of optimising the rtc of distributed storages for a range of selected optimised layouts this experiment uses the single critical duration determined from experiment 1 and selected optimal layouts from experiment 2 which corresponded to different system storage volumes ranging from 100 m3 to 1000 m3 in 100 m3 increments i e 100 m3 200 900 1000 m3 the decision variables for the optimisation of the rtc include the percentage opening of the storage outlet orifices and the time step at which such changes will be made the available percentage openings included 0 fully closed 1 2 and 100 fully open and the control time step was 5 minutes as there was only a single objective i e to minimise peak flow objective function convergence was used as the stopping criterion where the optimisation run stops when the peak flow does not change by more than 0 01l s over ten successive generations of the ea 3 3 performance assessment system peak flow reduction was used as the measure for assessing the performance of experiments 1 to 3 which corresponds to the change in peak flow at the outlet of the catchment from a no storage scenario baseline i e a stormwater system without any storage see fig 2 a consequently the peak flow reduction for an experiment is given by 6 s y s t e m pe a k fl o w re d u c t i o n 1 max q system i max q system baseline 100 where max q system i is the peak flow of a specific experiment and max q system baseline is the peak flow of the no storage scenario 3 4 implementation of simulation optimisation approach in order to implement the two simulation optimisation approaches presented in sections 2 2 and 2 3 as well as the end of system optimisation runs described in section 3 2 a software linking two python packages one for optimisation and one for simulation was developed the two constituent python packages include i deap distributed evolutionary algorithms in python developed by the computer vision and systems laboratory at université laval in quebec city canada fortin et al 2012 which was used as the optimisation package and ii pyswmm python wrapper for stormwater management model developed by emnet llc in south bend usa which was used together with swmm as the stormwater simulation package deap v2 1 is a python package that applies evolutionary algorithms to solve real world problems the package includes a number of evolutionary algorithms including genetic algorithm ga genetic programming gp evolution strategy es and particle swarm optimisation pso in this study the multi and single objective variants of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsgaii deb et al 2002 algorithm in the deap package were used to select the decision variables for the optimisation problems formulated in sections 2 2 and 2 3 respectively nsgaii variants have been used successfully to solve urban stormwater optimisation problems previously di matteo et al 2017 di matteo et al 2019 paseka et al 2018 the swmm stormwater management model developed by the united states environmental protection agency is used to simulate the stormwater system peak flows epa swmm v5 1 012 is a widely used

input the decision variables storage volumes locations and control strategies into the stormwater management model swmm 4 results 4 1 performance of end of system eos storage 4 1 1 overview of results optimal trade off curve fig 7 a shows the optimal trade off curve of system peak flow versus system storage volume for the eos storage for the three storm durations considered i e 20 min 25 min and 45 min experiment 1 fig 6 as can be seen the critical duration depends on the system storage for system storage of less than 900 m3 a storm duration of 25 min is the critical duration as it provides the highest peak flow however when the system storage is larger than 900 m3 a storm duration of 45 min produces a higher peak flow and thus becomes critical as demonstrated by the crossover point between the yellow and orange lines in fig 7 a given that a duration of 25 min is critical for a wide range of storages i e all storage volumes up to 900 m3 this duration is used for experiments 2 and 3 as described in section 3 2 4 1 2 analysis of results flood hydrograph of a typical event the optimal trade off curve in fig 7 a shows that at least 650 m3 of storage is required before any reductions in peak flow occur for the critical 25 min storm duration when a single eos storage is used the reasons for this are shown by the flood hydrograph and time series of storage level for a storage volume of 580 m3 in fig 7 b the eos storage does not have sufficient detention capacity to produce a peak flow reduction analysis of the flow with no storage scenario black dotted line fig 7 b shows that the peak flow occurs at t 35 mins the eos storage fills early in the storm t 28 mins orange line fig 7 b before the peak flow occurs at t 35 mins blue line fig 7 b prior to filling the eos storage is able to reduce the flow blue line fig 7 b t 28 mins however once the eos storage is full no reduction in flow occurs and the flow blue line fig 7 b t 28 mins is similar to the one with no storage black dotted line fig 7 b t 28 mins this means for the eos storage scenario a storage volume larger than 650 m3 will be required to achieve meaningful peak flow reduction this size of storage is likely to have practical implications regarding space availability as discussed in section 5 3 4 2 performance of distributed storage with optimised layout and real time control 4 2 1 overview of results optimal trade off curve fig 8 shows that the use of distributed storage with optimised layouts experiment 2 results in significant peak flow reductions these range from 5 for a 100 m3 system storage volume to 52 for a 900 m3 system storage volume this is in contrast to the single eos storage experiment 1 which did not result in any peak flow reduction for storage volumes less than 650 m3 even when the system storage volume is increased from 650 m3 to 900 m3 the resulting maximum peak flow reduction for the single eos storage is only 8 fig 8 this highlights that distributed storages with optimised layouts have far greater potential for reducing peak flows in stormwater systems compared with the use of eos storages optimal real time control distrib storage rtc experiment 3 is able to further improve the performance of the optimised distributed storage system with approximately an additional 10 reduction in the peak flow compared to the no storage scenario fig 8 this improvement is significant when there is a relatively small system storage volume for example for a system storage volume of 100 m3 the distrib storage layout scenario experiment 2 is only able to achieve a 4 peak flow reduction however the addition of real time smart control experiment 3 is able to increase this value to 14 which corresponds to a 2 5 times increase the addition of optimal real time control also has the potential to significantly reduce the system storage volume required to achieve a target peak flow reduction for example if the target peak flow reduction was 39 the distrib storage layout scenario without real time control would require a storage volume of around 700 m3 experiment 2 fig 8 red line however with the addition of real time control experiment 3 the system storage volume required to achieve the same target peak flow reduction reduces from 700 m3 to only 400 m3 red line fig 8 this corresponds to a 43 reduction in the required system storage volume 4 2 2 analysis of results flood hydrographs at system outfall and storage layouts for typical cases this section examines the flood hydrographs at the system outfall and optimised storage locations for a series of typical cases to assist with understanding the mechanisms that result in the simulated peak flow reductions this will be complemented by an examination of the flood hydrographs from internal catchment locations in the following section section 4 2 3 fig 9 compares the hydrograph for a single storm event storm temporal pattern 4 at the system outfall for the baseline and three different typical cases as defined previously the baseline case is the no storage scenario typical cases 1 and 2 are for the distributed storage with optimised layout distrib storage layout scenario with system storage volumes of 200 m3 and 800 m3 respectively and will be described below the third typical case is for the distributed storage with optimised layout and control distrib storage rtc scenario with a system storage volume of 200 m3 fig 10 shows the corresponding optimised layouts storage volumes and the percentage contributing catchment areas for each of the optimised storage locations and volumes typical case 1 distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume for the first typical case the flood hydrographs fig 9 show that a system storage volume of 200 m3 results in a peak flow reduction from 1 978 lps no storage scenario to 1 620 lps distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume fig 9 the hydrograph for the no storage scenario has a single peak at 1 978lps t 34 min while the hydrograph for the distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume scenario has two peaks at 1 480lps t 28 min and 1 620lps t 36 min respectively fig 10 shows that the optimised layout to achieve this is a single storage of 200 m3 at location 5 which regulates flow from 59 of the catchment typical case 2 distrib storage layout 800 m3 storage volume for the second typical case for which the system storage volume is 800 m3 the system peak flow is reduced from 1 978 lps no storage scenario to 1 000 lps distrib storage layout 800 m3 storage volume fig 9 the hydrograph for the distrib storage layout 800 m3 storage volume scenario has two peaks with the first occurring at t 32 min with a value of 840lps the second 1 000lps peak lasts around 8 mins from t 40 min to t 48 min similar to the first typical case the optimised layout still includes a storage at location 5 but there is an additional storage at location 7 fig 10 the optimal volumes of the storages at locations 5 and 7 are 298 m3 and 502 m3 respectively typical case 3 distrib storage rtc 200 m3 storage volume this typical case corresponds to the application of real time control to the optimised layout described in the first typical case distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume and therefore consists of a single storage of 200 m3 at location 5 by applying a real time smart control strategy to this storage the system peak flow is reduced further from 1 620 l s distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume fig 9 to 1 480 l s distrib storage rtc 200 m3 storage volume fig 9 the hydrograph for the distrib storage rtc 200 m3 storage volume case similar to that for the distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume case also has two peaks with the first peak t 28 min unchanged the second peak t 36 min is reduced from 1 620 l s to 1 480 l s resulting in an overall reduction in peak flow 4 2 3 analysis of results flood hydrographs at multiple catchment locations for typical cases fig 11 shows the hydrographs at internal catchment locations for the baseline and three typical cases are shown in fig 9 in order to illustrate the mechanisms that enable the distributed storages to reduce peak flow the hydrographs of the following three different kinds of flow at multiple catchment locations are given 1 the total flow at the system outfall location 3 fig 10 2 the regulated flow which is contributed to by catchments upstream of the storage location location 1 or 2 fig 10 and 3 the non regulated flow which is contributed to by catchments downstream of the storage location location 1 or 2 fig 10 baseline no storage scenario the hydrographs for the no storage scenario are given in fig 11 a the total flow at the system outfall has a peak of 1 978l s yellow line fig 11 a which is a coincident peak resulting from the falling limb of the non regulated flow blue line fig 11 a and the peak of the regulated flow green line fig 11 a typical case 1 distrib storage layout 200 m3 storage volume fig 11 b illustrates the hydrographs resulting from using a 200 m3 distributed storage to reduce the total peak flow compared with that obtained using the no storage scenario the primary mechanism responsible for the reduction in peak flow by the addition of the single 200 m3 storage at location 5 appears to be a delay of the regulated flow resulting from the catchments upstream of location 1 corresponding to 59 of the total catchment area the peak regulated flow of the no storage scenario occurs at t 33 min green dashed line fig 11 b while for the distrib storage layout scenario this flow is delayed by 5 min to t 38 min with the aid of the storage solid green line fig 11 b as a result the original total flow hydrograph yellow dashed line fig 11 b is modified to a double peak solid yellow line fig 11 b where the first peak primarily corresponds to the non regulated flow from the 41 of sub catchment areas that is not delayed and the second peak primarily to the regulated flow from the 59 of sub catchment areas that is delayed by the 200 m3 storage at location 5 fig 10 typical case 2 distrib storage layout 800 m3 storage volume fig 11 c illustrates the hydrographs resulting from using 800 m3 of distributed storage to reduce the total peak flow compared with using 200 m3 when the system storage is increased from 200 m3 to 800 m3 the peak flow reduction is due to two different mechanisms the first is the offsetting of the hydrographs from different sub catchments via the storage at location 5 similar to the case when the system storage volume is 200 m3 which is evidenced by the double peak in the system outfall hydrograph solid yellow line fig 11 c the second is the delay and attenuation of the hydrograph from the runoff from the majority of the catchment 91 fig 10 b as it passes through the larger 502 m3 storage at location 7 green dashed line and green solid line fig 11 c which further delays the peak of the regulated flow from t 36 m to t 44 min so that it is fully offset from the non regulated flow blue line fig 11 c as a result the peak of the total flow at the system outfall solid yellow line fig 11 c is only contributed to by the regulated flow solid green line fig 11 c resulting in a significant reduction in peak flow at the system outfall typical case 3 distrib storage rtc scenario 200 m3 storage volume fig 12 shows the hydrographs of using 200 m3 distributed storage with rtc compared with the case of using the same storages without any control fig 12 a and the corresponding storage levels and orifice opening percentages fig 12 b for the case without any control the total flow hydrograph has two peaks yellow dashed line fig 12 a the first of these 1 480l s t 28 min is mainly caused by the non regulated flow blue line fig 12 a while the second 1 620l s t 36 min is mainly caused by the regulated flow green dashed line fig 12 a for the case with rtc the rising limb and peak of the regulated flow are attenuated t 28 42 min solid green line fig 12 a by the orifice being fully closed from t 26 min to t 35 min fig 12 b as a result the second peak in the total flow hydrograph solid yellow line fig 12 a is reduced to around 1 480l s which is similar to the magnitude of the first peak there is no need for the rtc to reduce the second peak further as the first peak is now the dominant peak of the total flow hydrograph it should be noted that the storage is full at t 28 min fig 12 b and thus the storage volume is not large enough to deal with both the first and second peaks consequently the optimisation algorithm was able to identify the most efficient rtc strategy which is to reduce the magnitude of the second peak of the total flow hydrograph to be just less than the first peak 5 discussion 5 1 summary of key mechanisms for peak flow reduction the results indicate that by distributing storages at strategic locations throughout a catchment and optimising their volumes system peak outflows can be reduced this occurs by staggering the peak inflows from different sub catchments thereby reducing the coincidence of peaks at the confluence of different sub catchments delaying and attenuating hydrographs as they pass through the storages by adding optimised control to the optimised layouts of the distributed storage the outflow of the storages can be regulated in a way that further reduces peak flows by utilizing available storage capacity to delay and reduce the runoff peaks from specific sub catchments to avoid large coincident peaks therefore the timing and degree of the outlet operations offer the potential for further peak flow reductions these conclusions build on the results of cunha et al cunha et al 2016 who found that by adding storage units to stormwater systems at optimal locations allows for integrated flow control and hence peak flow reduction throughout the system 5 2 advantages of separating the impacts of optimised layout and rtc to the authors knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of optimising both the locations and volumes of storages as well as their rtc strategy previous studies that focus on testing various rtc schemes on storage s using pre determined volume s di matteo et al 2019 maiolo et al 2020 sadler et al 2019 shen et al 2020 are not able to show the relative effectiveness of layout versus rtc approaches at the catchment scale as the results only show the combined impact of the layout and the rtc this study has decoupled this combined effect into its constituent components with the results illustrating that rtc is more beneficial for smaller systems storage volumes for example as discussed in section 4 2 1 there is a 250 relative increase in performance when rtc is added to storages with optimised location and volume when the system storage volume is only 100 m3 due to its high computational cost the simulation optimisation approaches for layout and rtc are conducted sequentially in this study a limitation of this approach is that as the optimised storage locations and volumes are determined prior to the optimisation of the rtc strategy the optimal combined strategy might not have been identified there may be opportunities to achieve better performance by optimising the storage layouts and rtc strategies simultaneously as has been shown to be the case for the joint optimisation of design and dispatch for wind diesel systems garcia and weisser 2006 design and operation of water distribution systems stokes et al 2016 and water energy systems giudici et al 2019 maintenance and buffer sizes in manufacturing systems ribeiro et al 2007 and production rate and preventive maintenance in machining systems cheng et al 2016 5 3 practical benefits of optimising layout of distributed storages the practical benefits of the approach developed in this study to identify optimal trade offs between system storage volume and the corresponding peak flow reduction are as follows for real complex catchment systems similar to the case study the size of the search space is extremely large it is highly unlikely that even near optimal solutions could be found using a manual trial and error design process maier et al 2019 in addition a manual approach would not make it possible to generate optimal trade offs which have been shown to aid decision making processes in a number of related problem domains dandy and engelhardt 2006 di matteo et al 2019 newland et al 2020 newman et al 2014 wang et al 2020 end of system storages usually require a large storage volume to achieve meaningful peak flow reduction however due to space availability this is not always feasible myers 2019 the use of distributed storages not only requires a smaller system storage volume but the distributed nature of the storages means that the storage volume required at a particular location is generally relatively small making them significantly easier to implement from a practical perspective distributed storages with optimised layout can be implemented with current technology providing a practically viable alternative to upgrading existing stormwater conveyance systems potentially avoiding major investments the relative advantage of optimised distributed storages is likely to increase i if peak flow reductions can be achieved further upstream as this reduces the need to upgrade any stormwater conveyance infrastructure downstream of this location and ii with the length of stormwater conveyance infrastructure that would require upgrading if peak flows were not reduced 5 4 practical benefits and challenges of optimising rtc of distributed storages with further development in control and rainfall forecasting technologies it is likely that it will become practical to reliably add optimised rtc to distributed storage systems as an adaptive strategy to deal with increases in stormwater runoff due to factors such as climate change population growth and urbanisation in addition with the aid of rtc distributed storage systems are able to achieve multiple benefits in addition to flood mitigation including water quality improvement and stormwater harvesting campisano et al 2017 dandy et al 2019 di matteo et al 2019 muschalla et al 2014 shen et al 2020 this is achieved by equipping distributed storages with low cost sensors and controllers that allow water levels to be monitored and the release of water to be automatically controlled for different objectives for example the outlet of distributed storages could be kept closed during non flooding events and the stored stormwater runoff used for environmental purposes including watering green public space and keeping biofilters alive shen et al 2020 xu et al 2020 however given that the case study presented in this paper is one of a real world system and that significant peak flow reductions were observed simply by adding distributed storages of optimal volumes in optimal locations the first step of the proposed two step approach provides a practical option for reducing peak flows rtc can be added at a later date in order to increase system robustness mcphail et al 2021 and provide adaptive capacity if this is found to be required based on system stress tests such as those associated with climate change bennett et al 2021 culley et al 2021 5 5 future research future research that can be undertaken to increase the performance and practicality of the proposed simulation optimisation approaches includes 1 the development of rtc schemes based on known information of storage levels and or flows in the stormwater system in addition to or in lieu of the use of rainfall forecasts as is the case in this study 2 identification of potential trade offs between system cost and peak flow reductions in this study system storage volume was used as a surrogate for total cost 3 developing and testing an optimisation framework that optimises storage layouts and rtc schemes simultaneously 4 testing the proposed rtc approach as part of physical experiments on a real or laboratory based system and 5 using a stormwater simulation model that is calibrated to observed data from a case study catchment utilising techniques that incorporate the multiple sources of predictive uncertainty in the rainfall runoff model mcinerney et al 2020 mcinerney et al 2017 6 conclusions this study demonstrates that distributed storage with optimised layout and distributed storage with optimised layout and control can significantly reduce peak outflows from stormwater systems and are more effective than the use of end of system storage for the 36 ha catchment case study an end of system storage was not able to achieve significant peak flow reductions when the system storage volume was smaller than 690 m3 in contrast distributed storage with optimised layouts was able to achieve significant peak flow reduction ranging from 5 for a 100 m3 storage volume to 40 for a storage volume of 700 m3 the addition of optimised real time control was able to achieve a further 10 reduction which is more significant for smaller system storage volumes for example with the same 100 m3 optimised distributed storage the addition of real time control is able to increase peak flow reduction from 4 to 14 analysis of the flood hydrographs shows these reductions are achieved by attenuating stormwater hydrographs at individual storages as well as delaying hydrographs to reduce their coincidence at the confluence of sub catchments thereby reducing system peak outflows the formal optimisation of the locations and volumes of distributed storages provides a practical solution to mitigating increasing stormwater system outflows as it can generally be accommodated easily within existing systems due to the relatively small volume of individual storages real time control of storages which requires some technological developments provides opportunities to adapt to further increases in peak outflows due to climate change

4243,the aim of this paper is to explore how rainfall mechanisms and catchment characteristics shape the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities we propose a new approach of comparing intensity duration frequency statistics of maximum annual rainfall with those of maximum annual streamflow in order to infer the catchment behavior for runoff extremes we calibrate parsimonious intensity duration frequency scaling models to data from 314 rain gauges and 428 stream gauges in austria and analyze the spatial patterns of the resulting distributions and model parameters results indicate that rainfall extremes tend to be more variable in the dry lowland catchments dominated by convective rainfall than in the mountainous catchments where annual rainfall is higher and rainfall mechanisms are mainly orographic flood frequency curves are always steeper than the corresponding rainfall frequency curves with the exception of glaciated catchments based on the proposed approach of combined intensity duration frequency statistics we analyze elasticities as the percent change of flood discharge for a 1 change in extreme rainfall through comparing rainfall and flood quantiles in wet catchments the elasticities tend to unity i e rainfall and flood frequency curves have similar steepness due to persistently high soil moisture levels in dry catchments elasticities are much higher implying steeper frequency curves of floods than those of rainfall which is interpreted in terms of more skewed distributions of event runoff coefficients while regional differences in the elasticities can be attributed to both dominating regional rainfall mechanisms and regional catchment characteristics our results suggest that catchment characteristics are the dominating controls with increasing return period elasticities tend towards unity which is consistent with various runoff generation concepts our findings may be useful for process based flood frequency extrapolation and climate impact studies and further studies are encouraged to explore the tail behavior of elasticities keywords rainfall floods probabilities rainfall mechanisms catchment characteristics elasticity 1 introduction the relationship between rainfall and flood discharge probabilities is important from both practical and theoretical perspectives the design storm method widely applied in engineering practice consists of estimating a hydrograph with given peak discharge probability from a synthetic rainstorm with the same probability using a rainfall runoff model packman kidd 1980 pilgrim cordery 1975 another common procedure that transforms rainfall to flood probabilities is the rational formula which estimates peak streamflow from a critical rainfall intensity from a theoretical perspective the interplay between the statistical behavior of extreme rainfall and catchment processes that produces the flood frequency curve is an interesting topic for the hypothetical case of rectangular rainstorms of fixed duration a constant event runoff coefficient and invariant routing the distribution functions of flood peaks and rainfall intensities are proportional but for real world storms and catchments numerous factors make the flood frequency distribution deviate from that of the rainfall the extreme rainfall distribution depends on the climatological situation at the site of interest its expected value has been found to be positively correlated with mean annual rainfall in analyses of hourly and daily rain gauge data in different climatic regions united states australia the british isles japan india peninsular malaysia barbero et al 2019 in these studies daily time steps usually exhibited higher correlations than hourly as the latter were mainly controlled by convection while the former were also controlled by other mechanisms such as large scale dynamics and orographic effects that are more relevant at the annual scale similarly positive correlations between daily precipitation extremes and the wet day mean rainfall have been reported by benestad et al 2012 for more than 33 000 rain gauges across the globe single years with exceptional rainfall extremes such as from tropical storms tend to increase the coefficient of variation cv of the rainfall distribution and thus the steepness of the rainfall frequency curve u s weather bureau 1958 depending on the region these rare extremes can be associated with climate modes such as the el niño southern oscillation enso and the pacific oscillation ipo kiem et al 2003 or with rare interactions of convection favoring patterns piper et al 2016 typically in regions with frequent short duration convective rainfall events the cv of annual rainfall maxima is higher and rainfall frequency curves are thus steeper than in more humid regions where rainstorms are longer parrett 1997 schaefer 1990 in intensity duration frequency statistics a strong decay with duration reflects peaky rainstorms suggesting dominance of convective rainfall e g awadallah 2015 breinl et al 2020 panthou et al 2014 sane et al 2018 higher expected values of the rainfall distribution and larger cvs may lead to higher and steeper flood frequency curves everything else being equal merz blöschl 2003 smith et al 2011 villarini smith 2010 another relevant factor controlling the flood frequency curve is antecedent catchment wetness berghuijs et al 2016 komma et al 2007 slater villarini 2016 in wet catchments storage capacities tend to be lower and event runoff coefficients tend to be higher thus increasing flood discharges of a given probability relative to dry catchments borga et al 2007 vivoni et al 2007 more specifically it has been suggested that the distribution of event runoff coefficients influences the steepness of the flood frequency curve in arid catchments where infiltration excess dominates the event runoff coefficients are mainly random as opposed to more humid catchments where runoff coefficients are less variable merz blöschl 2009b sivapalan et al 2005 infiltration excess runoff is typical of convective rainfall regions with large cvs of rainfall extremes keefer et al 2016 so the flood frequency curves are typically steeper than in more humid catchments dominated by synoptic rainfall basso et al 2016 franchini et al 2005 guo et al 2014 hashemi et al 2000 viglione et al 2009 steeper flood frequency curves can also be a consequence of the spatial distribution of the rainfall as rare extreme flood peaks can occur if locally high rainfall intensities match locally high soil moisture bell moore 2000 zhu et al 2018 additionally a steep flood frequency curve can be the result of rainfall exceeding a threshold of soil storage capacity rogger et al 2012 a threshold of epikarst storage in karstic environment li et al 2017 or other threshold processes of runoff generation struthers sivapalan 2007 zehe sivapalan 2009 runoff routing may also impact the flood frequency curve blöschl sivapalan 1997 norbiato et al 2008 as the largest floods are produced when storm duration matches the response time viglione blöschl 2009 a faster runoff response with increasing event magnitude as it often occurs due to a higher relevance of surface and near surface flow paths and greater surface flow depths will be reflected in an increasingly steeper flood frequency curve with return period rogger et al 2012 one way of quantifying the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities is the concept of elasticity which is defined as the relative change in streamflow divided by the relative change in precipitation e g sankarasubramanian et al 2001 while in the past the elasticity concept in hydrology has mainly been applied to annual rainfall and streamflow we believe it has also potential for rainfall and streamflow extremes if the flood frequency curve is proportional to the rainfall frequency curve the elasticity is unity if the flood frequency curve is steeper than the rainfall frequency curve elasticity is greater than unity studies on annual rainfall and streamflow found that streamflow is most sensitive to rainfall change in dry catchments due to the nonlinearity in the rainfall runoff process e g chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 tang et al 2019 yang yang 2011 for extreme rainfall and floods there seems to similarly exist a stronger sensitivity in dry catchments for example the data of paquet et al 2013 suggest that a 1 increase of an extreme 72hr rainfall 300 mm produced a 2 6 2 0 and 1 5 increase in extreme runoff for dry intermediate and wet conditions estimated from fig 16 of paquet et al 2013 however to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of data based regional analyses that have explored flood sensitivities to extreme rainfall most of the above studies have analyzed the rainfall to flood probability transformation by a model based derived flood frequency concept e g sivapalan et al 2005 viglione blöschl 2009 viglione et al 2009 zhu et al 2018 studies on the rainfall elasticity of streamflow have similarly been model based e g chiew 2006 tang et al 2019 or have focused on annual streamflow rather than extremes e g sankarasubramanian et al 2001 yang yang 2011 while model based approaches are able to isolate individual factors well it is difficult to ascertain model validity real world processes may deviate from those assumed in the models as the consequence of the coevolution of climate and landscape processes perdigão and blöschl 2014 on the other hand an analysis of a large data set of rainfall and runoff observations may be able to shed light on the more complex real world relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities including different rainfall mechanisms and non linear runoff generation processes as a function of soil type and geology the aim of this paper therefore is to explore how rainfall mechanisms and catchment characteristics shape the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities based on comprehensive runoff and rainfall observations to this end we propose a new approach of comparing intensity duration frequency statistics of maximum annual rainfall with those of maximum annual streamflow the analysis is based on a high quality data set of 314 rain gauges and 428 runoff gauges in austria in order to identify the effects of individual processes on the probability relationship we adopt the concept of comparative hydrology contrasting catchments with different rainfall and runoff generation processes blöschl et al 2013 rather than evaluating individual events we estimate intensity duration frequency statistics for both rainfall and streamflow and compare them for equivalent return periods evaluating the elasticity of floods to rainfall extremes in order to minimize the effects of snow melt we focus on the summer season when most of the floods in austria occur gaál et al 2012 the relevance of the study is twofold first the elasticities explored here enable more informed extrapolations to larger than observed floods using rainfall statistics e g goel et al 2000 second the elasticities may also shed light on the impact of climate change on flood through changing rainfall extremes the study may also underpin a more informed application of methods for estimating design floods the research addresses two of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology uph i e 5 what causes spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity in runoff evaporation subsurface water and material fluxes and 10 why are runoff extremes in some catchments more sensitive to land use cover and geomorphic change than in others blöschl et al 2019 the paper is structured as follows section 2 provides an overview of the study region and data the methods section 3 introduces the intensity duration frequency models for both extreme rainfall and streamflow and the analytical solution of the extreme rainfall elasticity to floods which we use to compare the rainfall and streamflow distributions in the results section 4 we explain the spatial patterns of the rainfall and streamflow characteristics as well as the elasticities by rainfall mechanisms topography soils geology and climate variables the paper finishes with a discussion and conclusions 2 study region and data the study is set in austria 84 000 km2 in the north east and south east elevations are below 200 m above sea level while the highest alpine summits reach over 3 500 m fig 1 a mean annual rainfall ranges from less than 400 mm yr 1 in the east to more than 3000 mm yr 1 in the west we used hourly streamflow data from stream gauges in austria for the period 1976 2015 june to august with a mean length of 36 years maximum of 40 years minimum of 21 years time series of catchments strongly influenced by hydraulic infrastructure were excluded which resulted in 428 catchments with areas ranging from 3 9 km2 to 4 792 km2 and a median of 125 km2 fig 1b we also used hourly rainfall observations from 314 austrian rain gauges for the period 1950 2016 june to august with a mean length of 20 years maximum of 43 years minimum of 10 years fig 1b catchments impacted by karst springs were identified based on a visual comparison with hydrogeological maps rainfall and flood mechanism vary considerably within the study region in general convective rainfall and flash floods are most frequent in the lowlands identifiable by a higher frequency of hailstorms severe wind gusts and tornados in these regions fig a1 dotzek et al 2009 and merz and blöschl 2003 while short rain and long rain floods from orographic rainfall are most frequent along the alpine ridge merz blöschl 2003 aligned with longer wet spells and shorter dry spells along the alpine ridge compared to the lowlands fig a2 throughout austria floods are more frequent in the summer than in the winter merz blöschl 2003 to investigate the regional differences rain gauges and catchments were grouped into five regions based on the previous rainfall based classifications by matulla et al 2003 seibert et al 2007 and breinl et al 2020 fig 1b we chose a rainfall based classification in order to better understand regionally dominant factors in runoff formation i the western orographic region is dominated by orographic rainfall due to airflows from western nnw and nw directions long rain floods are most frequent and the highest catchments are affected by glacier melt gaál et al 2012 ii in the northern orographic region heavy rainfall is mainly caused by nnw nw and west airflows from the atlantic seibert et al 2007 producing long rain floods iii in the northeastern convective region in the northern lowlands of austria frequent convective rainstorms produce flash floods and westerly flows produce long rain floods the latter include vb weather situations where moist air from the adriatic sea is advected causing heavy rainfall seibert et al 2007 iv the eastern mixed region is influenced by convective activity partly due to the hilly terrain which increases the instability of the boundary layer merz blöschl 2003 leading to frequent flash floods and hail storms v the southern mixed region is similarly influenced by convective activity sometimes associated with weak gradient situations and rainfall extremes can also be related to the advection of humid air from the mediterranean gaál et al 2012 seibert et al 2007 flood response is also influenced by geology fig 1c the flysch zone along the northern fringe of the alps is characterized by low subsurface permeability and thus surface or near surface flow paths leading to flashy response similarly shallow soils and efficient drainage networks in the southeast lead to short response times gaál et al 2012 on the other hand in the phyllite region in the south deeply weathered metamorphic rock is associated with deep flow paths and slow flood response gaál et al 2012 the latter is also typical for the catchments dominated by gravel and sand aquifers for example in the northwest and east gaál et al 2012 3 methods studies that explain the generating mechanisms of floods in a probabilistic context usually compare the flood frequency curve with event based rainfall and catchment drivers e g arnaud lavabre 2002 rahman et al 2002 stein et al 2021 in this paper however we have chosen the flood duration frequency qdf curve e g cunderlik ouarda 2006 2007 javelle et al 2003 javelle et al 2002 as a starting point instead in order to approach the problem in a more general way a qdf curve is composed of extreme value distributions of streamflow for different aggregation intervals for example one identifies the maximum hourly streamflow i e streamflow averaged over one hour in every year and constructs a frequency distribution from that in a similar way frequency distributions are constructed for other aggregation intervals thus obtaining a family of curves for a particular catchment in the limit of the aggregation interval of d 0 the qdf curve is equivalent to the traditional flood frequency curve the qdf curve can therefore be considered an extension of the latter as it not only contains information on the peak but also on the shape of the hydrographs for example if the 1hr and 12hrs distributions are similar hydrographs are subdued while much larger streamflow for 1hr than for 12hrs points towards peaky hydrographs the idea of qdf curves is similar to that of intensity duration frequency idf curves of rainfall e g sivapalan blöschl 1998 which are estimated in an analogous way the idf curves are a fingerprint of the extreme rainfall regime in terms of increasing rainfall intensities with increasing return period and decreasing duration a steep dependence of rainfall intensity on the return period i e representing a large variability between years may indicate the dominance of convective over frontal rainfall mechanisms parrett 1997 schaefer 1990 because of the similarity of the idf and qdf concepts their comparison is straightforward in fact for a hypothetical rainfall runoff transformation where all rainfall becomes runoff event runoff coefficient rc 1 and an infinitely fast runoff concentration time of concentration t c 0 idf and qdf curves are identical in reality the event runoff coefficient is smaller than 1 and the time of concentration is greater 0 and therefore the qdf curve will differ from the corresponding idf curve the deviations will depend on runoff generation event runoff coefficients and their distribution runoff concentration times of concentration and any nonlinearities that may be present as well as the rainfall characteristics for example in catchments with short response times short intense rainstorms will lead to particularly high flood peaks and the qdf curve will therefore mainly reflect the short durations of the idf curve while the longer durations are less relevant see fig 7a in viglione blöschl 2009 in order to shed light on the similarities between the qdf curves and their associated idf curves we fit idf and qdf models independently to observations of rainfall and streamflow data respectively and compare them in a second step 3 1 probability models for rainfall and streamflow extremes for representing extreme rainfall we adopt the model of koutsoyiannis et al 1998 1 i p a t p b d p where i p is the maximum annual rainfall intensity mm hr 1 of duration d p at a station and a and b are terms that only depend on the return period t p and the duration d p respectively the denominator is parameterized by a scaling relationship with duration while the enumerator is represented by a gumbel distribution which was found to represent the austrian rainfall data well breinl et al 2020 the idf model quantile function is thus defined as koutsoyiannis et al 1998 2 i p a t p b d p λ p ψ p l n ln 1 1 t p d p η p w i th λ p 0 t p 1 d p 1 h r 0 η p 1 with the location parameter ψ p the scale parameter λ p and the scaling parameter η p in order to facilitate the comparison with rainfall we use an analogous model for streamflow i e the qdf relationship is represented by 3 i q a t q b d q λ q ψ q l n ln 1 1 t q d q η q w i t h λ q 0 t q 1 d q 1 h r 0 η q 1 where i q is the maximum annual specific streamflow mm hr 1 a log likelihood ratio test e g smith 1992 on the austrian data confirmed that the gumbel distribution is preferable over a gev distribution for the majority of gauges the parameters of the idf and qdf models can be interpreted as follows the scale parameters λ p and λ q for a given duration are directly proportional to the standard deviations σ p and σ q of the random variables 4 σ p λ p d p η p π 6 σ q λ q d q η q π 6 the location parameters ψ p and ψ q describe the shift of the distributions i e a higher location parameter implies higher rainfall or streamflow extremes ceteris paribus the average magnitudes of rainfall and streamflow extremes are defined by the expected values μ p and μ q of the random variables 5 μ p λ p d p η p 0 5772 ψ p μ q λ q d q η q 0 5772 ψ q and thus depend on the duration scale and scaling parameters the scaling parameters η p and η q quantify the decay of intensity with increasing duration at stations where extreme rainstorms are short e g due to convective rainfall η p tends to be high reflecting a strong decay whereas at stations where extreme rainstorms are longer e g due to frontal rainfall η p tends to be lower llasat 2001 mohymont et al 2004 panthou et al 2014 for example mohymont et al 2004 and panthou et al 2014 who used a similar scaling model found high values of η p in zones of high convective activity for the case of streamflow the scaling parameter η q reflects the flashiness of catchment response i e slim hydrographs are associated with larger values of η q than more subdued hydrographs the cvs of i p and i q are expressed as 6 c v p π 6 0 5772 ψ p c v q π 6 0 5772 ψ q this means the cvs equation 6 only depend on the respective location parameters ψ p and ψ q this is a consequence of the form of the scaling models equations 2 and 3 annual maximum intensities of rainfall were extracted from the hourly rainfall series for the period june august using a moving window of five durations 1 h r 3 h r s 6 h r s 12 h r s 24 h r s empirical return periods were assigned to each annual maximum for each duration using gringorten plotting positions koutsoyiannis et al 1998 all parameters of the rainfall model were then fitted in one step by minimizing the logarithmized least squares deviation between the intensities of the observation and the model using the derivative free optimization algorithm of powell 2009 the mean absolute percentage difference averaged over all gauges and durations between the fitted intensities and the intensities obtained by separately fitting gumbel distributions with maximum likelihood was 3 0 2 8 for d 1hr 4 1 for d 24hrs for t 2 y r s and 8 5 12 7 for d 1hr 10 4 for d 24hrs for t 100 y r s the streamflow model was fitted in an analogous way and the corresponding goodness of fit figures were 7 0 5 1 for d 1hr 7 0 for d 24hrs and 8 5 9 6 for d 1hr 11 7 for d 24hrs respectively 3 2 combined rainfall flood relationship the idf and qdf curves for a given catchment can be compared in different ways here we chose to compare streamflow quantiles with the rainfall quantiles by matching return periods and matching durations i e setting t q t p t and d q d p d this comparison does not imply a relationship of rainfall and streamflow of individual events instead it examines the similarities of the two distributions irrespective of the time extreme rainfall and floods occur the equivalence of t q and t p seems an obvious choice for comparing the two distributions because it is a traditional assumption in design methods e g design storm method again this assumption does not imply that t q and t p of a single event are identical which is often not the case see for example alfieri et al 2008 rahman et al 2002 viglione et al 2009 instead it provides a common reference point of the distributions the assumption of setting d q d p is less obvious given that one is usually interested in d q 0 while accounting for various d p we have chosen here to set d q equal to d p to allow for a more generalized comparison that goes beyond the flood peak distribution however careful consideration of the implications of this assumption is necessary also see discussion making the above assumption and by combining equations 2 and 3 we can now plot for each catchment the rainfall flood probability relationship i q i p t d fig 2 where constant duration d and constant return period t are represented by dashed black and dotted red lines respectively in order to characterize the behavior of the i q i p t d relationship we evaluated the elasticity of streamflow to changes in rainfall as a function of t and d we first expressed the relationship in terms of d const which is defined as 7 i q i p d η q λ q d η p i p λ p ψ p ψ q with λ p 0 λ q 0 d 1 h r 0 η p 1 0 η q 1 if d const equation 7 has a constant slope λ q d η p λ p d η q as reflected by the dashed black lines in fig 2 from equation 7 the elasticity ε 1 of streamflow relative to changes of rainfall assuming d const is obtained as 8 ε 1 i q i p i p i p i q i p d η p i p λ p d η p i p λ p ψ p ψ q w i t h λ p 0 d 1 h r 0 η p 1 lim i p ε 1 1 interestingly ε 1 depends neither on the streamflow scale parameter λ q nor on the streamflow scaling parameters η q by inserting i p into equation 8 ε 1 can also be expressed in terms of t as 9 ε 1 ψ p u ψ q u with the gumbel reduced variate u l n ln 1 1 t lim t ε 1 1 which indicates that ε 1 is only a function of the return period and the location parameters for c v p c v q ε 1 1 on the other hand expressing the i q i p t d relationship in terms of t const red dotted lines in fig 2 gives 10 i q i p λ q i p λ p ψ p u η q η p ψ q u w i t h λ p 0 λ q 0 t 1 0 η p 1 0 η q 1 from which the elasticity ε 2 for t const is obtained as 11 ε 2 i q i p i p i p i q i p η q η p to give a more intuitive illustration of the idf qdf relationship we performed simulations convoluting an observed rainfall time series 43 years with a linear reservoir and analyzing the resulting hydrographs according to equation 3 fig 3 a shows the mapping of idf and qdf curves for d 1hr and different return periods t implicit in the magnitudes of i q and i p for the limiting case of a response time of 0 i e storage coefficient of the linear reservoir k 0 and a runoff coefficient r c 1 streamflow is equal to rainfall and the relationship plots on the 1 1 line as k increases the streamflow event peaks decrease and so does i q fig 3b shows the relationship for t q t p 2 y r s and different durations d implicit in the magnitudes of i q and i p again streamflow decreases with increasing k particularly for short durations for long durations as demonstrated through experiments assuming block rainfall and varying storm durations d s blöschl sivapalan 1997 the decrease is less pronounced because in a linear system the peak is approximately proportional to d s k which is similar to our approach using different aggregation intervals i e d k the simulations also allow an illustration of the behavior of the elasticities ε 1 and ε 2 for a storage coefficient k 0 and a runoff coefficient rc 1 both ε 1 and ε 2 are unity due to the 1 1 mapping of precipitation to streamflow meaning a 1 change in rainfall relates to a 1 change in streamflow fig 3c with increasing k the elasticity ε 1 decreases to about 0 85 this is because with higher k rainfall in the time steps adjoining the annual maxima becomes increasingly more relevant in determining the maximum annual streamflow due to the convolution of the linear reservoir while for small k the annual maxima of the rainfall and streamflow mostly occur on the same day this synchronicity of date of occurrence is lost with increasing k in the case of ε 2 the decrease of the elasticity with k is more pronounced from 1 to about 0 1 which relates to the above described dependence of the peak reduction on d k in order to test the sensitivity of the elasticities to the presence of randomness in the runoff coefficient we assumed the runoff coefficient for each event defined as rainfall wet spell to vary randomly between 0 and 1 according to a beta distribution with a mean of 0 29 α 2 β 5 instead of using rc 1 fig 3c and fig 3d these values of α and β are representative of medium rainfall regions in austria merz et al 2006 random rc increase the elasticity ε 1 which is related to the possibility of combinations of large rainfall with large runoff coefficients which steepens the flood frequency curve and thus increases ε 1 viglione et al 2009 more skewed beta distributions led to an even larger increase of the elasticity ε 1 not shown here on the other hand the runoff coefficient has little influence on ε 2 as it does not modulate the interplay of k and d for our analyses instead of using the nearest rain gauge to each catchment we interpolated the parameters of the rainfall model equation 2 to the catchment centroids to be able to make use of all rain gauges as in some cases the same rain gauge would be assigned to multiple catchments we used kriging with external drift elevation was used as auxiliary variable as it outperformed ordinary kriging by means of the statistics package gstat version 2 0 2 of r version 4 0 3 pebesma wesseling 1998 we compared the idf curves from interpolated rainfall parameters with those of the rain gauge nearest to the catchment centroid and they were similar 3 3 correlation analysis in order to interpret the elasticities in the context of comparative hydrology we correlated the rainfall model parameters λ p ψ p η p and streamflow model parameters λ q ψ q η q with catchment attributes climate indicators

groups were obtained from a digital soil map for austria österreichische bodenkundliche gesellschaft 2001 geology of each catchment was taken from a digital geological map of austria weber et al 2019 long term mean annual map and mean seasonal summer rainfall msp based on more than 1 000 daily rainfall gauges were taken from parajka et al 2005 event runoff coefficients as analyzed by merz et al 2006 were available in 342 of the 428 catchments for the summer season for an average of 131 event runoff coefficients per catchment 3 4 significance tests to support the analysis of regional differences of the model parameters and the elasticities we applied the non parametric kruskal wallis test to examine whether parameters elasticities of different regions originate from the same distribution kruskal wallis 1952 the test does not assume normally distributed residuals additionally we applied dunn s multiple comparison test dunn 1964 with a bonferroni correction of the experiment wise error rate e g armstrong 2014 to identify which pairs of the regions are significantly different 4 results 4 1 rainfall model parameters and rainfall mechanism we first investigated the estimated parameters of the rainfall model equation 2 there is a negative dependency between the scale parameter λ p and the location parameter ψ p fig 4 a spearman correlation r s 0 62 p less than 0 05 this dependency seems to be related to regional differences in the rainfall processes annual rainfall extremes in the west dark blue points in fig 4 tend to be large with little variability high ψ p small λ p in the east yellow and red points in fig 4 annual rainfall extremes tend to be small small ψ p but high rainfall extremes are still possible high λ p there is a positive dependency between λ p and the scaling parameter η p r s 0 86 p 0 05 fig 4b with the western regions exhibiting low η p and λ p and the eastern regions exhibiting high η p and λ p this pattern is aligned with the dominance of orographic rainfall in the west and that of convective rainfall in the east a negative dependency between ψ p and η p r s 0 56 p 0 05 exists i e high rainfall amounts high ψ p are related to rainstorms that are less peaky small η p fig 4c 4 2 comparison of rainfall and streamflow cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the rainfall and streamflow extremes stratified by the five rainfall regions are given in fig 5 and fig 6 at a 1hr duration fig 5 top the cdfs of rainfall tend to be flatter in the orographic regions e g western orographic than in the regions more strongly influenced by convective mechanisms e g eastern mixed the streamflow cdfs in the northeastern eastern and southern regions represent smaller values than in the west and north which is much more a reflection of runoff generation and routing than of rainfall given the rather similar rainfall cdfs moreover streamflow cdfs are considerably steeper in the east compared to the west for example the median streamflow at the 99 percentile is 4 9 times higher than at the 5 percentile in the northeastern convective zone while it is only 2 3 times higher in the western orographic region the shapes of the streamflow cdfs within each region are more diverse than those of rainfall fig 5 bottom row again reflecting runoff generation and routing processes the catchments indicated by dashed and dotted lines are impacted by karst springs and glaciers respectively which further increase the within region variability at a duration of 24hrs intensities of rainfall and streamflow are lower as expected however the steepness i e the cv of the 24hr and 1hr durations are the same as the scaling models equations 2 and 3 apply the same gumbel distribution scaled over different durations the majority of karstic and glaciated catchments exhibit higher streamflow intensities compared to the rainfall these may be related to factors other than rainfall such as glacier melt and differences between orographic and hydrologic catchment area the rainfall and streamflow model parameters reflecting the rainfall and flood intensities shown in fig 5 and fig 6 are given in fig 7 corresponding maps in fig a3 the eastern mixed region exhibits the highest values of the scale parameter λ p reflecting the high variability of rainfall extremes while the variability of streamflow extremes λ q is highest in the northern orographic region fig 7a also see fig a3a b hence the variability of streamflow extremes is spatially not aligned with that of the rainfall extremes the location parameters ψ p and ψ q fig 7b have a similar spatial distribution r s 0 69 both are smallest in the northeastern convective region and largest in the western orographic and the southern mixed regions both parameters are highest in the high elevation zones of austria fig a3c d this result can be interpreted as the influence of orographic rainfall and perhaps also higher runoff coefficients merz blöschl 2009b also as ψ p and ψ q define the cv of the extremes see equation 6 one can conclude that the cv of rainfall is higher in the lowlands influenced by convective mechanisms compared to the alpine orographic regions the cv of streamflow is likewise higher in the dry lowlands and decreases with increasing elevation and thus increasing annual rainfall possibly due to the smaller variability of runoff coefficients merz blöschl 2009b the lowest cv of streamflow occurs in the glaciated areas as the values of ψ q are the highest also see fig 1a thus as opposed to the scale parameters see above the cvs of rainfall and floods are spatially aligned the scaling parameters of the streamflow η q are generally lower than the ones of the rainfall η p reflecting the dampening effects of catchment processes fig 7c moreover η p and η q are spatially aligned with the largest values in the northeastern convective and eastern mixed regions this behavior reflects the higher convective activity and flashier flood response also see fig a3e f there are striking similarities between the spatial distribution of η q and the concentration times of catchments as analyzed by gaal et al 2012 from flood events gaal et al 2012 fig 4 which is not surprising as η q reflects the catchment response time dunn s multiple comparison test table a1 reveals that parameters are often significantly different at the 5 level between the alpine regions and the lowlands e g between the northeastern convective region and the southern mixed region whereas within these two major zones significant differences of fewer parameters are identified e g between the western orographic regions and the southern mixed region 4 3 spatial correlation of model parameters the statistical properties of the streamflow extremes can only be partly explained by the properties of extreme rainfall other potential controls include catchment topography soil properties geology and long term climate all of these controls are assessed by the correlation analysis of fig 8 all correlations discussed below are significant at the 5 level the correlation between the scale parameter of streamflow λ q and that of rainfall λ p is low as would be expected from fig 7a but higher correlations of λ q exist with catchment area r s 0 46 and mean topographic slope r s 0 33 suggesting that streamflow extremes are more variable in small and in steep than in large and flat catchments λ q is negatively correlated with soils of high water holding capacity such as phaeozem and chernosem iuss working group wrb 2015 r s 0 30 and r s 0 31 suggesting that pervious soils reduce streamflow variability reduced variability can also be detected for phylitte geology r s 0 36 which is a deeply weathered metamorphic rock with deep flow paths and slow flood response gaal et al 2012 furthermore a positive correlation exists between λ p and the cv of the event runoff coefficients r c c v r s 0 62 as well as λ p and the skewness of the event runoff coefficients r c c s r s 0 51 suggesting that the latter are more variable and skewed in regions of increased rainfall variability the location parameter of streamflow ψ q is positively correlated with the location parameter of rainfall extremes ψ p r s 0 69 in line with fig 7b mean annual map and summer rainfall msp r s 0 38 and r s 0 55 which can be interpreted through rainfall mechanisms map and msp increase with mean catchment elevation due to orographic effects e g r s 0 62 between msp and elevation which is consistent with the positive correlation between elevation and ψ p r s 0 71 ψ q and ψ p are negatively correlated with r c c v r s 0 62 and r s 0 5 and with r c c s r s 0 5 and r s 0 41 suggesting that event runoff coefficients tend to be less variable and less skewed in regions of high rainfall amounts the scaling parameter η q is positively correlated with that of precipitation η p r s 0 30 pointing towards a relationship between the convective activity of rainfall and the flashiness of catchments however there are higher absolute correlations between η q and catchment area r s 0 35 and the stream network density r s 0 48 which suggests that the flashiness of streamflow hydrographs decreases with catchment area and increases with stream network density as would be expected 4 4 elasticities the elasticity ε 1 of streamflow relative to changes of the rainfall assuming d const equation 8 is characterized by a distinct spatial pattern fig 9 and fig 10 the elasticities ε 1 are shown in fig 9 as boxplots and in fig 10 as maps the sizes of the points in fig 10 represent the values of ε 1 for each gauged catchment at the catchment centroids the background pattern is generated by interpolation from these catchment values ordinary kriging and is intended to better highlight the regional patterns for t 2 y r s the rainfall streamflow relationships are highly elastic i e ε 1 1 in the lowlands in the north northeast and southeast e g northeastern convective rainfall region compared to the high alpine regions e g western orographic region where the elasticity is closer to unity i e ε 1 1 left boxplots of fig 9 and fig 10a in the glaciated regions of the highest summits of austria regions in red colors in fig 10 also see glaciated areas in fig 1a the relationships are inelastic ε 1 1 for a return period of t 100 y r s right boxplots in fig 9 and fig 10b the spatial pattern remains similar but the elasticities tend towards unity although our approach of analyzing the rainfall flood relationship refers to a comparison of distribution functions rather than individual events we additionally analyzed the synchronicity of the dates of annual rainfall and streamflow extremes in order to explore whether the event producing the largest annual streamflow are often the same as those producing the largest rainfall to this end stream gauges were compared to the nearest rain gauges with at least ten years of recording overlap fig a4 shows the percentage of annual rainfall and streamflow maxima that occurred within 24hrs of each other for the duration of 1hr left boxplots and 24hrs right boxplots stratified by rainfall regions the synchronicity of both durations is highest in the lowlands of the north and east which are regions of flashy catchment response represented by large η q fig a3f in these regions also elasticities ε 1 fig 9 are highest this is in line with our simulation experiments fig 3c which indicated small storage coefficients k to cause high elasticities ε 1 on the other hand synchronicities are smallest in the alpine regions e g western orographic region where values of η q are low the elasticity ε 2 of streamflow relative to rainfall changes assuming t const equation 11 is highest in the dry lowlands in the northeast and east northeastern convective and eastern mixed rainfall region fig 11 and fig 12 as in the case of fig 10 the sizes of the points in fig 12 represent the values of ε 2 for each gauged catchment at the catchment centroids while the background pattern is generated by interpolation from these catchment values ordinary kriging in these regions catchment concentration times tend to be short as indicated by high η q fig 7c and storm durations tend to be short indicated by high η p as high values η p indicate fast decrease of rainfall intensity with duration also indicated by the short average wet spell duration in fig a2b generally the closer ε 2 is to unity the more similar is the duration of flood triggering rainstorms and the concentration time of the catchment equation 11 on the other hand the elasticities ε 2 in the alpine regions e g northern orographic region are lower the pronounced similarities of the spatial patterns of ε 1 fig 10 and the location parameter of the streamflow ψ q fig a3d as well as the spatial patterns of ε 2 fig 12 and the scaling parameter of the streamflow η q fig a3f suggest that catchment processes dominate the runoff transformation since ε 1 is defined by the location parameters equation 9 and ε 2 by the scaling parameters equation 11 the dominance of catchment processes is also visible in the cumulative distribution functions of rainfall and streamflow fig 5 and fig 6 with more pronounced differences between the cdfs of the streamflow of different regions compared to the rainfall moreover the elasticity ε 1 t 2 y r s is positively correlated with the cv of the event runoff coefficients r c c v r s 0 59 and the skewness of the runoff coefficients r c c s r s 0 49 indicating that ε 1 is increased in regions of more variable and skewed runoff coefficients dunn s multiple comparison test table a1 reveals that there are no significant differences between ε 1 in the alpine western orographic and southern mixed regions the situation is similar for ε 2 where no statistically significant differences can be detected between the alpine western orographic northern orographic and southern mixed regions and between the northeastern convective and the eastern mixed regions as with the model parameters it appears that the regional differences of the elasticities can be broadly generalized into differences between the precipitation rich alps and the dry lowlands 5 discussion our analyses based on the concept of comparative hydrology unravel the most important factors including dominating rainfall and catchment characteristics that control the differences between the distributions of rainfall and streamflow extremes the moments and parameters of the rainfall distribution are aligned with the regional rainfall mechanisms in the high elevation catchments where orographic rainfall dominates the location parameter ψ p tends to be high and the scale parameter λ p tends to be small i e the rainfall extremes tend to be large with little temporal variability see fig a3a and a3c the opposite applies to catchments in the lowlands where convective rainfall extremes are more frequent the relationship between rainfall magnitude and variability is reflected by a high negative correlation between ψ p and λ p fig 4a and fig 8 r s 0 62 the regional rainfall mechanisms also manifest themselves in the spatial distribution of the scaling parameter η p which tends to be higher in the convective lowlands than in the mountainous regions with dominant orographic rainfall fig a3e a higher parameter η p implies that the intensity decreases more strongly with duration which can be expected for the short rainstorms that occur frequently in the lowlands as in the case of rainfall the location parameter of streamflow ψ q is higher in the mountain catchments than in the lowlands see fig a3d reflected by a strong positive correlation of ψ q with catchment elevation fig 8 r s 0 77 and mean summer rainfall fig 8 r s 0 55 this means the magnitude of floods tends to be higher in the orographic rainfall regions not only due the higher extreme rainfall magnitudes but also due to high annual rainfall amounts possibly leading to high soil moisture levels persistently high runoff coefficients and to a propensity towards saturation excess overflow the variability of streamflow represented by the scale parameter λ q however is controlled by catchment topography soil type and the geology e g correlations with slope r s 0 33 rendzina soils r s 0 21 or carbonate rock geology r s 0 28 fig 8 and is thus highest along the alpine ridge fig a3b while the variability of the rainfall represented by λ p is mainly controlled by elevation see negative correlation between λ p and elevation in fig 8 and is highest in the lowlands fig a3a some of the highest values of λ q relate to karstic catchments along the alpine divide see fig 1a catchments with crosses fig a3b and positive correlation between λ q and carbonate rock in fig 8 in karstic catchments during periods of average rainfall events most of the rainfall may be stored in the fractured carbonic rocks while more extreme rainfall events can saturate the epikarst zone inducing large streamflow extremes li et al 2017 and thus more variable floods such step changes in streamflow extremes may also occur in other geological formations rogger et al 2012 the scaling parameter η q fig a3f on the other hand is highest in the lowlands showing a similarity with the spatial distribution of the rainfall scaling parameter η p which is also lowest in the lowlands for the comparison of rainfall and flood distributions one can conclude not surprisingly that higher rainfall extremes tend to lead to higher floods as the positive correlation between the location parameters ψ p and ψ q indicates fig 8 r s 0 69 this relationship is more distinct in regions dominated by orographic rainfall where runoff coefficients are persistently high merz blöschl 2003 such as in the northern orographic region r s 0 70 the relationship is not existent in the northeastern convective region where runoff coefficients tend to be lower and more random merz blöschl 2003 r s 0 01 in this context the relationship between ψ p and elevation is also more distinct for the alpine orographic regions e g correlation between ψ p and elevation r s 0 81 in the northern orographic region than in the convective lowlands e g r s 0 35 in the northeastern convective region which is in line with barbero et al 2019 who found stronger positive correlation between expected values of daily rainfall compared to hourly rainfall as the former integrate large scale dynamics and orographic effects barbero et al 2019 since the cv is a direct function of the location parameter similar correlations apply between c v q and c v p in other words a steeper rainfall frequency curve is associated with a steeper flood frequency curve which is in line with previous studies e g merz blöschl 2003 smith et al 2011 villarini smith 2010 the scale parameter of rainfall is not aligned with that of streamflow reflected by r s 0 14 between λ p and λ q and different spatial patterns fig a3a a3b and fig 8 the spatial patterns of the scaling parameters η p and η q are to some extent aligned fig 8 r s 0 3 with larger parameters in the north and east and lower in the west this similarity suggests that the response times of catchments to the storms producing the annual floods tend to be shorter in regions dominated by convective activity north and northeast while the opposite is the case in the west the similarity is possibly due to an interplay of climatic and catchment processes over time modulated by the geology gaal et al 2012 for example the efficient drainage network in the southeast of austria leads to short response times and may have evolved from the dominating convective rainfall mechanisms in the region see for example high frequency of hailstorms in fig a1 as intense convective rainstorms increase the overland flow which in return influences the drainage network abrahams ponczynski 1984 tucker bras 2000 we quantified the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities by elasticities ε 1 represents the percent change of flood discharge for a 1 in extreme rainfall change assuming duration d is constant elasticities ε 1 are highest in the dry lowlands in the northeast and southeast fig 9 and fig 10 for t 2 y r s they are more than four times higher than the mean of the alpine catchments that is in the dry lowlands flood frequency curves are considerably steeper than the rainfall frequency curves which is consistent with the regional analyses merz blöschl 2009a 2009b viglione et al 2009 suggested that in dry regions steep flood frequency curves can result from the occurrence of extraordinary events with runoff coefficients exceeding by far those of other events in the catchment gutknecht et al 2002 komma et al 2007 reflecting a highly skewed distribution of runoff coefficients in the mountainous catchments of the study region where annual rainfall is above 1000 mm yr 1 elasticities ε 1 are closer to unity fig 9 and fig 10 in these catchments the high orographic rainfall may frequently lead to soil saturation and thus event runoff coefficients tend to be high merz blöschl 2009b and therefore the steepness of the flood frequency curves is similar to that of the idf curves another possible explanation is the slower catchment response in parts of the high rainfall regions gaal et al 2012 as a result of a more pervious geology for example in the southern mixed rainfall zone where the phylitte geology reduces the response time fig 1c and thus may reduce elasticity as illustrated in the simulation experiment fig 3 this is because for slow response times the highest rainfall extreme of year and a given duration does not necessarily cause the highest flood peak in that year the lower correspondence of rainfall and flood events is also in line with their lower synchronicity fig a4 the decoupling is even more pronounced in the glaciated catchments fig 10 red areas where elasticities drop below unity as a consequence of glacier melt that is more relevant to floods than rainfall extremes ε 2 represents the percent change of flood discharge for a 1 change in extreme rainfall assuming the return period t is constant in the model ε 2 is represented by η q η p equation 11 i e the ratio of the temporal scaling of streamflow and extreme rainfall regions of high elasticities ε 2 are regions of fast catchment response as indicated by gaal et al 2012 which is aligned with values of η q and to some degree η p fig 11 fig 12 and fig a3f fast catchment response is mainly related to shallow soils and clay and marl and flysch geologies with low infiltration fig 1c as well as an efficient drainage network gaal et al 2012 holko et al 2011 in these regions also relevant storm durations tend to be short due to the dominance of convective rainfall which in combination with the fast catchment response explains the high elasticities ε 2 regions of low elasticities ε 2 on the other hand are those with slow catchment response as in the south of the country where the deeply weathered phylitte geology dominates while to our knowledge no regional data based studies on elasticities of streamflow extremes exist our results are in line with previous studies on elasticities of annual streamflow that show largest elasticities in dry climates e g chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 tang et al 2019 yang yang 2011 elasticities ε 1 tend towards unit elasticity with increasing return period as can be seen from equation 9 fig 9 and fig 10 this behavior is a consequence of the model formulation and fully consistent with hydrological reasoning for both infiltration excess and saturation excess mechanisms runoff tends to become more similar to rainfall as the rainfall intensity increases and if soil saturation is reached any additional rainfall transforms into surface runoff this behavior implies that the gradients of the tails of the flood and rainfall distribution become similar i e ε 1 1 which is the rationale behind the gradex method guillot 1993 merz blöschl 2008 naghettini et al 1996 our results suggest that this assumption is fully consistent with the combined intensity duration frequency analysis adopted here and found suitable for the austrian data given the similarity in runoff generation mechanism in terms of increasing runoff contributions with increasing return period mcdonnell 2013 it is possible that the tendency towards unit elasticity with increasing return period may hold in many regions throughout the world however it may be of interest to test the elasticity behavior using more complex models both similar combined models but with a larger number of parameters and joint distribution models such as copulae e g balistrocchi bacchi 2011 klein et al 2010 which allow for a more flexible description of the intensity duration frequency analysis in our analysis of elasticities we assumed that the return periods of rainfall and floods are the same this assumption seems natural given that it provides a common reference point for comparing distributions we also assumed that the durations of rainfall and floods are the same d q d p d however for the models adopted here eq 2 and 3 the elasticity ε 1 in fact does not depend on this assumption and is also valid for d q d p see also equation 9 as long as t q t p t d q c o n s t and d p c o n s t it is therefore equally valid for e g d q 1 h r approximately representing peak flow and d p 1 h r representing the various durations of the idf curve on the other hand for ε 2 d q d p d is a prerequisite while the assumption t q t p t is not necessary but t q c o n s t and t p c o n s t the independences of ε 1 on d and ε 2 on t result from the assumption of self affinity in the scaling models for rainfall and runoff equations 2 and 3 in which the same extreme value distribution is scaled by durations while these scaling models were found to be suitable for this study region this may not apply to other regions where other scaling models perhaps with more parameters may be more appropriate our work has various implications the sensitivity of floods to extreme rainfall as proposed here may be useful when extrapolating to flood frequency distributions beyond observed floods one possibility would be a bayesian framework costa fernandes 2017 viglione et al 2013 which allows incorporating this type of process based information for such applications it may be worth considering alternative distributions such as the gev that have more flexibility in the tail behavior in particular if the flood distribution is heavy tailed while the associated rainfall distribution is not the limiting elasticity may be greater than unity additionally there is potential for elasticity analyses in the context of climate impact studies analyzing long term changes of the elasticity of extremes may be useful for detecting long term variability in rainfall and streamflow time series to assist in hydrological model calibration for changing conditions duethmann et al 2020 lun et al 2020 more generally the elasticity of extremes may also be used as a benchmark tool for stochastic rainfall runoff modelling frameworks for example weather generators coupled with hydrological models e g bennett et al 2019 gao et al 2020 müller thomy sikorska 2019 okoli et al 2019 6 conclusion in this paper we present a new approach of comparing the rainfall flood relationship based on quantiles from intensity duration frequency models instead of comparing the rainfall flood relationship of individual events e g viglione et al 2009 we compare distribution functions of extreme rainfall and streamflow without event based linkages for this comparison we apply the elasticity concept to extreme rainfall and streamflow which sets the study apart from the traditional application of the elasticity to annual rainfall and streamflow e g chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 tang et al 2019 yang yang 2011 our results suggest that the extreme rainfall elasticity to floods behaves similarly to the annual rainfall elasticity to annual streamflow elasticities are higher in regions of low annual rainfall where rainfall events are primarily short and convective than in regions of high annual rainfall where rainfall events are longer and more often of orographic nature these regional differences of elasticities are related to a variety of factors including the long term climate topography soils and geology for example high elasticities in the dry regions are related to more variable and skewed event runoff coefficients which may be caused by the dominance of infiltration excess mechanisms associated with high rainfall intensities in future research it would be interesting to compare the proposed distribution based approach with event based approaches such as those of viglione et al 2009 to explore whether the elasticities identified here provide information on how return periods from rainfall and streamflow relate to each other for individual

4243,the aim of this paper is to explore how rainfall mechanisms and catchment characteristics shape the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities we propose a new approach of comparing intensity duration frequency statistics of maximum annual rainfall with those of maximum annual streamflow in order to infer the catchment behavior for runoff extremes we calibrate parsimonious intensity duration frequency scaling models to data from 314 rain gauges and 428 stream gauges in austria and analyze the spatial patterns of the resulting distributions and model parameters results indicate that rainfall extremes tend to be more variable in the dry lowland catchments dominated by convective rainfall than in the mountainous catchments where annual rainfall is higher and rainfall mechanisms are mainly orographic flood frequency curves are always steeper than the corresponding rainfall frequency curves with the exception of glaciated catchments based on the proposed approach of combined intensity duration frequency statistics we analyze elasticities as the percent change of flood discharge for a 1 change in extreme rainfall through comparing rainfall and flood quantiles in wet catchments the elasticities tend to unity i e rainfall and flood frequency curves have similar steepness due to persistently high soil moisture levels in dry catchments elasticities are much higher implying steeper frequency curves of floods than those of rainfall which is interpreted in terms of more skewed distributions of event runoff coefficients while regional differences in the elasticities can be attributed to both dominating regional rainfall mechanisms and regional catchment characteristics our results suggest that catchment characteristics are the dominating controls with increasing return period elasticities tend towards unity which is consistent with various runoff generation concepts our findings may be useful for process based flood frequency extrapolation and climate impact studies and further studies are encouraged to explore the tail behavior of elasticities keywords rainfall floods probabilities rainfall mechanisms catchment characteristics elasticity 1 introduction the relationship between rainfall and flood discharge probabilities is important from both practical and theoretical perspectives the design storm method widely applied in engineering practice consists of estimating a hydrograph with given peak discharge probability from a synthetic rainstorm with the same probability using a rainfall runoff model packman kidd 1980 pilgrim cordery 1975 another common procedure that transforms rainfall to flood probabilities is the rational formula which estimates peak streamflow from a critical rainfall intensity from a theoretical perspective the interplay between the statistical behavior of extreme rainfall and catchment processes that produces the flood frequency curve is an interesting topic for the hypothetical case of rectangular rainstorms of fixed duration a constant event runoff coefficient and invariant routing the distribution functions of flood peaks and rainfall intensities are proportional but for real world storms and catchments numerous factors make the flood frequency distribution deviate from that of the rainfall the extreme rainfall distribution depends on the climatological situation at the site of interest its expected value has been found to be positively correlated with mean annual rainfall in analyses of hourly and daily rain gauge data in different climatic regions united states australia the british isles japan india peninsular malaysia barbero et al 2019 in these studies daily time steps usually exhibited higher correlations than hourly as the latter were mainly controlled by convection while the former were also controlled by other mechanisms such as large scale dynamics and orographic effects that are more relevant at the annual scale similarly positive correlations between daily precipitation extremes and the wet day mean rainfall have been reported by benestad et al 2012 for more than 33 000 rain gauges across the globe single years with exceptional rainfall extremes such as from tropical storms tend to increase the coefficient of variation cv of the rainfall distribution and thus the steepness of the rainfall frequency curve u s weather bureau 1958 depending on the region these rare extremes can be associated with climate modes such as the el niño southern oscillation enso and the pacific oscillation ipo kiem et al 2003 or with rare interactions of convection favoring patterns piper et al 2016 typically in regions with frequent short duration convective rainfall events the cv of annual rainfall maxima is higher and rainfall frequency curves are thus steeper than in more humid regions where rainstorms are longer parrett 1997 schaefer 1990 in intensity duration frequency statistics a strong decay with duration reflects peaky rainstorms suggesting dominance of convective rainfall e g awadallah 2015 breinl et al 2020 panthou et al 2014 sane et al 2018 higher expected values of the rainfall distribution and larger cvs may lead to higher and steeper flood frequency curves everything else being equal merz blöschl 2003 smith et al 2011 villarini smith 2010 another relevant factor controlling the flood frequency curve is antecedent catchment wetness berghuijs et al 2016 komma et al 2007 slater villarini 2016 in wet catchments storage capacities tend to be lower and event runoff coefficients tend to be higher thus increasing flood discharges of a given probability relative to dry catchments borga et al 2007 vivoni et al 2007 more specifically it has been suggested that the distribution of event runoff coefficients influences the steepness of the flood frequency curve in arid catchments where infiltration excess dominates the event runoff coefficients are mainly random as opposed to more humid catchments where runoff coefficients are less variable merz blöschl 2009b sivapalan et al 2005 infiltration excess runoff is typical of convective rainfall regions with large cvs of rainfall extremes keefer et al 2016 so the flood frequency curves are typically steeper than in more humid catchments dominated by synoptic rainfall basso et al 2016 franchini et al 2005 guo et al 2014 hashemi et al 2000 viglione et al 2009 steeper flood frequency curves can also be a consequence of the spatial distribution of the rainfall as rare extreme flood peaks can occur if locally high rainfall intensities match locally high soil moisture bell moore 2000 zhu et al 2018 additionally a steep flood frequency curve can be the result of rainfall exceeding a threshold of soil storage capacity rogger et al 2012 a threshold of epikarst storage in karstic environment li et al 2017 or other threshold processes of runoff generation struthers sivapalan 2007 zehe sivapalan 2009 runoff routing may also impact the flood frequency curve blöschl sivapalan 1997 norbiato et al 2008 as the largest floods are produced when storm duration matches the response time viglione blöschl 2009 a faster runoff response with increasing event magnitude as it often occurs due to a higher relevance of surface and near surface flow paths and greater surface flow depths will be reflected in an increasingly steeper flood frequency curve with return period rogger et al 2012 one way of quantifying the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities is the concept of elasticity which is defined as the relative change in streamflow divided by the relative change in precipitation e g sankarasubramanian et al 2001 while in the past the elasticity concept in hydrology has mainly been applied to annual rainfall and streamflow we believe it has also potential for rainfall and streamflow extremes if the flood frequency curve is proportional to the rainfall frequency curve the elasticity is unity if the flood frequency curve is steeper than the rainfall frequency curve elasticity is greater than unity studies on annual rainfall and streamflow found that streamflow is most sensitive to rainfall change in dry catchments due to the nonlinearity in the rainfall runoff process e g chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 tang et al 2019 yang yang 2011 for extreme rainfall and floods there seems to similarly exist a stronger sensitivity in dry catchments for example the data of paquet et al 2013 suggest that a 1 increase of an extreme 72hr rainfall 300 mm produced a 2 6 2 0 and 1 5 increase in extreme runoff for dry intermediate and wet conditions estimated from fig 16 of paquet et al 2013 however to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of data based regional analyses that have explored flood sensitivities to extreme rainfall most of the above studies have analyzed the rainfall to flood probability transformation by a model based derived flood frequency concept e g sivapalan et al 2005 viglione blöschl 2009 viglione et al 2009 zhu et al 2018 studies on the rainfall elasticity of streamflow have similarly been model based e g chiew 2006 tang et al 2019 or have focused on annual streamflow rather than extremes e g sankarasubramanian et al 2001 yang yang 2011 while model based approaches are able to isolate individual factors well it is difficult to ascertain model validity real world processes may deviate from those assumed in the models as the consequence of the coevolution of climate and landscape processes perdigão and blöschl 2014 on the other hand an analysis of a large data set of rainfall and runoff observations may be able to shed light on the more complex real world relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities including different rainfall mechanisms and non linear runoff generation processes as a function of soil type and geology the aim of this paper therefore is to explore how rainfall mechanisms and catchment characteristics shape the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities based on comprehensive runoff and rainfall observations to this end we propose a new approach of comparing intensity duration frequency statistics of maximum annual rainfall with those of maximum annual streamflow the analysis is based on a high quality data set of 314 rain gauges and 428 runoff gauges in austria in order to identify the effects of individual processes on the probability relationship we adopt the concept of comparative hydrology contrasting catchments with different rainfall and runoff generation processes blöschl et al 2013 rather than evaluating individual events we estimate intensity duration frequency statistics for both rainfall and streamflow and compare them for equivalent return periods evaluating the elasticity of floods to rainfall extremes in order to minimize the effects of snow melt we focus on the summer season when most of the floods in austria occur gaál et al 2012 the relevance of the study is twofold first the elasticities explored here enable more informed extrapolations to larger than observed floods using rainfall statistics e g goel et al 2000 second the elasticities may also shed light on the impact of climate change on flood through changing rainfall extremes the study may also underpin a more informed application of methods for estimating design floods the research addresses two of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology uph i e 5 what causes spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity in runoff evaporation subsurface water and material fluxes and 10 why are runoff extremes in some catchments more sensitive to land use cover and geomorphic change than in others blöschl et al 2019 the paper is structured as follows section 2 provides an overview of the study region and data the methods section 3 introduces the intensity duration frequency models for both extreme rainfall and streamflow and the analytical solution of the extreme rainfall elasticity to floods which we use to compare the rainfall and streamflow distributions in the results section 4 we explain the spatial patterns of the rainfall and streamflow characteristics as well as the elasticities by rainfall mechanisms topography soils geology and climate variables the paper finishes with a discussion and conclusions 2 study region and data the study is set in austria 84 000 km2 in the north east and south east elevations are below 200 m above sea level while the highest alpine summits reach over 3 500 m fig 1 a mean annual rainfall ranges from less than 400 mm yr 1 in the east to more than 3000 mm yr 1 in the west we used hourly streamflow data from stream gauges in austria for the period 1976 2015 june to august with a mean length of 36 years maximum of 40 years minimum of 21 years time series of catchments strongly influenced by hydraulic infrastructure were excluded which resulted in 428 catchments with areas ranging from 3 9 km2 to 4 792 km2 and a median of 125 km2 fig 1b we also used hourly rainfall observations from 314 austrian rain gauges for the period 1950 2016 june to august with a mean length of 20 years maximum of 43 years minimum of 10 years fig 1b catchments impacted by karst springs were identified based on a visual comparison with hydrogeological maps rainfall and flood mechanism vary considerably within the study region in general convective rainfall and flash floods are most frequent in the lowlands identifiable by a higher frequency of hailstorms severe wind gusts and tornados in these regions fig a1 dotzek et al 2009 and merz and blöschl 2003 while short rain and long rain floods from orographic rainfall are most frequent along the alpine ridge merz blöschl 2003 aligned with longer wet spells and shorter dry spells along the alpine ridge compared to the lowlands fig a2 throughout austria floods are more frequent in the summer than in the winter merz blöschl 2003 to investigate the regional differences rain gauges and catchments were grouped into five regions based on the previous rainfall based classifications by matulla et al 2003 seibert et al 2007 and breinl et al 2020 fig 1b we chose a rainfall based classification in order to better understand regionally dominant factors in runoff formation i the western orographic region is dominated by orographic rainfall due to airflows from western nnw and nw directions long rain floods are most frequent and the highest catchments are affected by glacier melt gaál et al 2012 ii in the northern orographic region heavy rainfall is mainly caused by nnw nw and west airflows from the atlantic seibert et al 2007 producing long rain floods iii in the northeastern convective region in the northern lowlands of austria frequent convective rainstorms produce flash floods and westerly flows produce long rain floods the latter include vb weather situations where moist air from the adriatic sea is advected causing heavy rainfall seibert et al 2007 iv the eastern mixed region is influenced by convective activity partly due to the hilly terrain which increases the instability of the boundary layer merz blöschl 2003 leading to frequent flash floods and hail storms v the southern mixed region is similarly influenced by convective activity sometimes associated with weak gradient situations and rainfall extremes can also be related to the advection of humid air from the mediterranean gaál et al 2012 seibert et al 2007 flood response is also influenced by geology fig 1c the flysch zone along the northern fringe of the alps is characterized by low subsurface permeability and thus surface or near surface flow paths leading to flashy response similarly shallow soils and efficient drainage networks in the southeast lead to short response times gaál et al 2012 on the other hand in the phyllite region in the south deeply weathered metamorphic rock is associated with deep flow paths and slow flood response gaál et al 2012 the latter is also typical for the catchments dominated by gravel and sand aquifers for example in the northwest and east gaál et al 2012 3 methods studies that explain the generating mechanisms of floods in a probabilistic context usually compare the flood frequency curve with event based rainfall and catchment drivers e g arnaud lavabre 2002 rahman et al 2002 stein et al 2021 in this paper however we have chosen the flood duration frequency qdf curve e g cunderlik ouarda 2006 2007 javelle et al 2003 javelle et al 2002 as a starting point instead in order to approach the problem in a more general way a qdf curve is composed of extreme value distributions of streamflow for different aggregation intervals for example one identifies the maximum hourly streamflow i e streamflow averaged over one hour in every year and constructs a frequency distribution from that in a similar way frequency distributions are constructed for other aggregation intervals thus obtaining a family of curves for a particular catchment in the limit of the aggregation interval of d 0 the qdf curve is equivalent to the traditional flood frequency curve the qdf curve can therefore be considered an extension of the latter as it not only contains information on the peak but also on the shape of the hydrographs for example if the 1hr and 12hrs distributions are similar hydrographs are subdued while much larger streamflow for 1hr than for 12hrs points towards peaky hydrographs the idea of qdf curves is similar to that of intensity duration frequency idf curves of rainfall e g sivapalan blöschl 1998 which are estimated in an analogous way the idf curves are a fingerprint of the extreme rainfall regime in terms of increasing rainfall intensities with increasing return period and decreasing duration a steep dependence of rainfall intensity on the return period i e representing a large variability between years may indicate the dominance of convective over frontal rainfall mechanisms parrett 1997 schaefer 1990 because of the similarity of the idf and qdf concepts their comparison is straightforward in fact for a hypothetical rainfall runoff transformation where all rainfall becomes runoff event runoff coefficient rc 1 and an infinitely fast runoff concentration time of concentration t c 0 idf and qdf curves are identical in reality the event runoff coefficient is smaller than 1 and the time of concentration is greater 0 and therefore the qdf curve will differ from the corresponding idf curve the deviations will depend on runoff generation event runoff coefficients and their distribution runoff concentration times of concentration and any nonlinearities that may be present as well as the rainfall characteristics for example in catchments with short response times short intense rainstorms will lead to particularly high flood peaks and the qdf curve will therefore mainly reflect the short durations of the idf curve while the longer durations are less relevant see fig 7a in viglione blöschl 2009 in order to shed light on the similarities between the qdf curves and their associated idf curves we fit idf and qdf models independently to observations of rainfall and streamflow data respectively and compare them in a second step 3 1 probability models for rainfall and streamflow extremes for representing extreme rainfall we adopt the model of koutsoyiannis et al 1998 1 i p a t p b d p where i p is the maximum annual rainfall intensity mm hr 1 of duration d p at a station and a and b are terms that only depend on the return period t p and the duration d p respectively the denominator is parameterized by a scaling relationship with duration while the enumerator is represented by a gumbel distribution which was found to represent the austrian rainfall data well breinl et al 2020 the idf model quantile function is thus defined as koutsoyiannis et al 1998 2 i p a t p b d p λ p ψ p l n ln 1 1 t p d p η p w i th λ p 0 t p 1 d p 1 h r 0 η p 1 with the location parameter ψ p the scale parameter λ p and the scaling parameter η p in order to facilitate the comparison with rainfall we use an analogous model for streamflow i e the qdf relationship is represented by 3 i q a t q b d q λ q ψ q l n ln 1 1 t q d q η q w i t h λ q 0 t q 1 d q 1 h r 0 η q 1 where i q is the maximum annual specific streamflow mm hr 1 a log likelihood ratio test e g smith 1992 on the austrian data confirmed that the gumbel distribution is preferable over a gev distribution for the majority of gauges the parameters of the idf and qdf models can be interpreted as follows the scale parameters λ p and λ q for a given duration are directly proportional to the standard deviations σ p and σ q of the random variables 4 σ p λ p d p η p π 6 σ q λ q d q η q π 6 the location parameters ψ p and ψ q describe the shift of the distributions i e a higher location parameter implies higher rainfall or streamflow extremes ceteris paribus the average magnitudes of rainfall and streamflow extremes are defined by the expected values μ p and μ q of the random variables 5 μ p λ p d p η p 0 5772 ψ p μ q λ q d q η q 0 5772 ψ q and thus depend on the duration scale and scaling parameters the scaling parameters η p and η q quantify the decay of intensity with increasing duration at stations where extreme rainstorms are short e g due to convective rainfall η p tends to be high reflecting a strong decay whereas at stations where extreme rainstorms are longer e g due to frontal rainfall η p tends to be lower llasat 2001 mohymont et al 2004 panthou et al 2014 for example mohymont et al 2004 and panthou et al 2014 who used a similar scaling model found high values of η p in zones of high convective activity for the case of streamflow the scaling parameter η q reflects the flashiness of catchment response i e slim hydrographs are associated with larger values of η q than more subdued hydrographs the cvs of i p and i q are expressed as 6 c v p π 6 0 5772 ψ p c v q π 6 0 5772 ψ q this means the cvs equation 6 only depend on the respective location parameters ψ p and ψ q this is a consequence of the form of the scaling models equations 2 and 3 annual maximum intensities of rainfall were extracted from the hourly rainfall series for the period june august using a moving window of five durations 1 h r 3 h r s 6 h r s 12 h r s 24 h r s empirical return periods were assigned to each annual maximum for each duration using gringorten plotting positions koutsoyiannis et al 1998 all parameters of the rainfall model were then fitted in one step by minimizing the logarithmized least squares deviation between the intensities of the observation and the model using the derivative free optimization algorithm of powell 2009 the mean absolute percentage difference averaged over all gauges and durations between the fitted intensities and the intensities obtained by separately fitting gumbel distributions with maximum likelihood was 3 0 2 8 for d 1hr 4 1 for d 24hrs for t 2 y r s and 8 5 12 7 for d 1hr 10 4 for d 24hrs for t 100 y r s the streamflow model was fitted in an analogous way and the corresponding goodness of fit figures were 7 0 5 1 for d 1hr 7 0 for d 24hrs and 8 5 9 6 for d 1hr 11 7 for d 24hrs respectively 3 2 combined rainfall flood relationship the idf and qdf curves for a given catchment can be compared in different ways here we chose to compare streamflow quantiles with the rainfall quantiles by matching return periods and matching durations i e setting t q t p t and d q d p d this comparison does not imply a relationship of rainfall and streamflow of individual events instead it examines the similarities of the two distributions irrespective of the time extreme rainfall and floods occur the equivalence of t q and t p seems an obvious choice for comparing the two distributions because it is a traditional assumption in design methods e g design storm method again this assumption does not imply that t q and t p of a single event are identical which is often not the case see for example alfieri et al 2008 rahman et al 2002 viglione et al 2009 instead it provides a common reference point of the distributions the assumption of setting d q d p is less obvious given that one is usually interested in d q 0 while accounting for various d p we have chosen here to set d q equal to d p to allow for a more generalized comparison that goes beyond the flood peak distribution however careful consideration of the implications of this assumption is necessary also see discussion making the above assumption and by combining equations 2 and 3 we can now plot for each catchment the rainfall flood probability relationship i q i p t d fig 2 where constant duration d and constant return period t are represented by dashed black and dotted red lines respectively in order to characterize the behavior of the i q i p t d relationship we evaluated the elasticity of streamflow to changes in rainfall as a function of t and d we first expressed the relationship in terms of d const which is defined as 7 i q i p d η q λ q d η p i p λ p ψ p ψ q with λ p 0 λ q 0 d 1 h r 0 η p 1 0 η q 1 if d const equation 7 has a constant slope λ q d η p λ p d η q as reflected by the dashed black lines in fig 2 from equation 7 the elasticity ε 1 of streamflow relative to changes of rainfall assuming d const is obtained as 8 ε 1 i q i p i p i p i q i p d η p i p λ p d η p i p λ p ψ p ψ q w i t h λ p 0 d 1 h r 0 η p 1 lim i p ε 1 1 interestingly ε 1 depends neither on the streamflow scale parameter λ q nor on the streamflow scaling parameters η q by inserting i p into equation 8 ε 1 can also be expressed in terms of t as 9 ε 1 ψ p u ψ q u with the gumbel reduced variate u l n ln 1 1 t lim t ε 1 1 which indicates that ε 1 is only a function of the return period and the location parameters for c v p c v q ε 1 1 on the other hand expressing the i q i p t d relationship in terms of t const red dotted lines in fig 2 gives 10 i q i p λ q i p λ p ψ p u η q η p ψ q u w i t h λ p 0 λ q 0 t 1 0 η p 1 0 η q 1 from which the elasticity ε 2 for t const is obtained as 11 ε 2 i q i p i p i p i q i p η q η p to give a more intuitive illustration of the idf qdf relationship we performed simulations convoluting an observed rainfall time series 43 years with a linear reservoir and analyzing the resulting hydrographs according to equation 3 fig 3 a shows the mapping of idf and qdf curves for d 1hr and different return periods t implicit in the magnitudes of i q and i p for the limiting case of a response time of 0 i e storage coefficient of the linear reservoir k 0 and a runoff coefficient r c 1 streamflow is equal to rainfall and the relationship plots on the 1 1 line as k increases the streamflow event peaks decrease and so does i q fig 3b shows the relationship for t q t p 2 y r s and different durations d implicit in the magnitudes of i q and i p again streamflow decreases with increasing k particularly for short durations for long durations as demonstrated through experiments assuming block rainfall and varying storm durations d s blöschl sivapalan 1997 the decrease is less pronounced because in a linear system the peak is approximately proportional to d s k which is similar to our approach using different aggregation intervals i e d k the simulations also allow an illustration of the behavior of the elasticities ε 1 and ε 2 for a storage coefficient k 0 and a runoff coefficient rc 1 both ε 1 and ε 2 are unity due to the 1 1 mapping of precipitation to streamflow meaning a 1 change in rainfall relates to a 1 change in streamflow fig 3c with increasing k the elasticity ε 1 decreases to about 0 85 this is because with higher k rainfall in the time steps adjoining the annual maxima becomes increasingly more relevant in determining the maximum annual streamflow due to the convolution of the linear reservoir while for small k the annual maxima of the rainfall and streamflow mostly occur on the same day this synchronicity of date of occurrence is lost with increasing k in the case of ε 2 the decrease of the elasticity with k is more pronounced from 1 to about 0 1 which relates to the above described dependence of the peak reduction on d k in order to test the sensitivity of the elasticities to the presence of randomness in the runoff coefficient we assumed the runoff coefficient for each event defined as rainfall wet spell to vary randomly between 0 and 1 according to a beta distribution with a mean of 0 29 α 2 β 5 instead of using rc 1 fig 3c and fig 3d these values of α and β are representative of medium rainfall regions in austria merz et al 2006 random rc increase the elasticity ε 1 which is related to the possibility of combinations of large rainfall with large runoff coefficients which steepens the flood frequency curve and thus increases ε 1 viglione et al 2009 more skewed beta distributions led to an even larger increase of the elasticity ε 1 not shown here on the other hand the runoff coefficient has little influence on ε 2 as it does not modulate the interplay of k and d for our analyses instead of using the nearest rain gauge to each catchment we interpolated the parameters of the rainfall model equation 2 to the catchment centroids to be able to make use of all rain gauges as in some cases the same rain gauge would be assigned to multiple catchments we used kriging with external drift elevation was used as auxiliary variable as it outperformed ordinary kriging by means of the statistics package gstat version 2 0 2 of r version 4 0 3 pebesma wesseling 1998 we compared the idf curves from interpolated rainfall parameters with those of the rain gauge nearest to the catchment centroid and they were similar 3 3 correlation analysis in order to interpret the elasticities in the context of comparative hydrology we correlated the rainfall model parameters λ p ψ p η p and streamflow model parameters λ q ψ q η q with catchment attributes climate indicators and event runoff coefficients table 1 topographic indices were taken from a digital elevation model of austria rieger 1999 the river network density was estimated from a digital river network map at a scale of 1 50000 fürst 2003 soil depth and bulk density were obtained from the isric international soil reference information centre world soil information database soilgrids hengl et al 2017 soil groups were obtained from a digital soil map for austria österreichische bodenkundliche gesellschaft 2001 geology of each catchment was taken from a digital geological map of austria weber et al 2019 long term mean annual map and mean seasonal summer rainfall msp based on more than 1 000 daily rainfall gauges were taken from parajka et al 2005 event runoff coefficients as analyzed by merz et al 2006 were available in 342 of the 428 catchments for the summer season for an average of 131 event runoff coefficients per catchment 3 4 significance tests to support the analysis of regional differences of the model parameters and the elasticities we applied the non parametric kruskal wallis test to examine whether parameters elasticities of different regions originate from the same distribution kruskal wallis 1952 the test does not assume normally distributed residuals additionally we applied dunn s multiple comparison test dunn 1964 with a bonferroni correction of the experiment wise error rate e g armstrong 2014 to identify which pairs of the regions are significantly different 4 results 4 1 rainfall model parameters and rainfall mechanism we first investigated the estimated parameters of the rainfall model equation 2 there is a negative dependency between the scale parameter λ p and the location parameter ψ p fig 4 a spearman correlation r s 0 62 p less than 0 05 this dependency seems to be related to regional differences in the rainfall processes annual rainfall extremes in the west dark blue points in fig 4 tend to be large with little variability high ψ p small λ p in the east yellow and red points in fig 4 annual rainfall extremes tend to be small small ψ p but high rainfall extremes are still possible high λ p there is a positive dependency between λ p and the scaling parameter η p r s 0 86 p 0 05 fig 4b with the western regions exhibiting low η p and λ p and the eastern regions exhibiting high η p and λ p this pattern is aligned with the dominance of orographic rainfall in the west and that of convective rainfall in the east a negative dependency between ψ p and η p r s 0 56 p 0 05 exists i e high rainfall amounts high ψ p are related to rainstorms that are less peaky small η p fig 4c 4 2 comparison of rainfall and streamflow cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the rainfall and streamflow extremes stratified by the five rainfall regions are given in fig 5 and fig 6 at a 1hr duration fig 5 top the cdfs of rainfall tend to be flatter in the orographic regions e g western orographic than in the regions more strongly influenced by convective mechanisms e g eastern mixed the streamflow cdfs in the northeastern eastern and southern regions represent smaller values than in the west and north which is much more a reflection of runoff generation and routing than of rainfall given the rather similar rainfall cdfs moreover streamflow cdfs are considerably steeper in the east compared to the west for example the median streamflow at the 99 percentile is 4 9 times higher than at the 5 percentile in the northeastern convective zone while it is only 2 3 times higher in the western orographic region the shapes of the streamflow cdfs within each region are more diverse than those of rainfall fig 5 bottom row again reflecting runoff generation and routing processes the catchments indicated by dashed and dotted lines are impacted by karst springs and glaciers respectively which further increase the within region variability at a duration of 24hrs intensities of rainfall and streamflow are lower as expected however the steepness i e the cv of the 24hr and 1hr durations are the same as the scaling models equations 2 and 3 apply the same gumbel distribution scaled over different durations the majority of karstic and glaciated catchments exhibit higher streamflow intensities compared to the rainfall these may be related to factors other than rainfall such as glacier melt and differences between orographic and hydrologic catchment area the rainfall and streamflow model parameters reflecting the rainfall and flood intensities shown in fig 5 and fig 6 are given in fig 7 corresponding maps in fig a3 the eastern mixed region exhibits the highest values of the scale parameter λ p reflecting the high variability of rainfall extremes while the variability of streamflow extremes λ q is highest in the northern orographic region fig 7a also see fig a3a b hence the variability of streamflow extremes is spatially not aligned with that of the rainfall extremes the location parameters ψ p and ψ q fig 7b have a similar spatial distribution r s 0 69 both are smallest in the northeastern convective region and largest in the western orographic and the southern mixed regions both parameters are highest in the high elevation zones of austria fig a3c d this result can be interpreted as the influence of orographic rainfall and perhaps also higher runoff coefficients merz blöschl 2009b also as ψ p and ψ q define the cv of the extremes see equation 6 one can conclude that the cv of rainfall is higher in the lowlands influenced by convective mechanisms compared to the alpine orographic regions the cv of streamflow is likewise higher in the dry lowlands and decreases with increasing elevation and thus increasing annual rainfall possibly due to the smaller variability of runoff coefficients merz blöschl 2009b the lowest cv of streamflow occurs in the glaciated areas as the values of ψ q are the highest also see fig 1a thus as opposed to the scale parameters see above the cvs of rainfall and floods are spatially aligned the scaling parameters of the streamflow η q are generally lower than the ones of the rainfall η p reflecting the dampening effects of catchment processes fig 7c moreover η p and η q are spatially aligned with the largest values in the northeastern convective and eastern mixed regions this behavior reflects the higher convective activity and flashier flood response also see fig a3e f there are striking similarities between the spatial distribution of η q and the concentration times of catchments as analyzed by gaal et al 2012 from flood events gaal et al 2012 fig 4 which is not surprising as η q reflects the catchment response time dunn s multiple comparison test table a1 reveals that parameters are often significantly different at the 5 level between the alpine regions and the lowlands e g between the northeastern convective region and the southern mixed region whereas within these two major zones significant differences of fewer parameters are identified e g between the western orographic regions and the southern mixed region 4 3 spatial correlation of model parameters the statistical properties of the streamflow extremes can only be partly explained by the properties of extreme rainfall other potential controls include catchment topography soil properties geology and long term climate all of these controls are assessed by the correlation analysis of fig 8 all correlations discussed below are significant at the 5 level the correlation between the scale parameter of streamflow λ q and that of rainfall λ p is low as would be expected from fig 7a but higher correlations of λ q exist with catchment area r s 0 46 and mean topographic slope r s 0 33 suggesting that streamflow extremes are more variable in small and in steep than in large and flat catchments λ q is negatively correlated with soils of high water holding capacity such as phaeozem and chernosem iuss working group wrb 2015 r s 0 30 and r s 0 31 suggesting that pervious soils reduce streamflow variability reduced variability can also be detected for phylitte geology r s 0 36 which is a deeply weathered metamorphic rock with deep flow paths and slow flood response gaal et al 2012 furthermore a positive correlation exists between λ p and the cv of the event runoff coefficients r c c v r s 0 62 as well as λ p and the skewness of the event runoff coefficients r c c s r s 0 51 suggesting that the latter are more variable and skewed in regions of increased rainfall variability the location parameter of streamflow ψ q is positively correlated with the location parameter of rainfall extremes ψ p r s 0 69 in line with fig 7b mean annual map and summer rainfall msp r s 0 38 and r s 0 55 which can be interpreted through rainfall mechanisms map and msp increase with mean catchment elevation due to orographic effects e g r s 0 62 between msp and elevation which is consistent with the positive correlation between elevation and ψ p r s 0 71 ψ q and ψ p are negatively correlated with r c c v r s 0 62 and r s 0 5 and with r c c s r s 0 5 and r s 0 41 suggesting that event runoff coefficients tend to be less variable and less skewed in regions of high rainfall amounts the scaling parameter η q is positively correlated with that of precipitation η p r s 0 30 pointing towards a relationship between the convective activity of rainfall and the flashiness of catchments however there are higher absolute correlations between η q and catchment area r s 0 35 and the stream network density r s 0 48 which suggests that the flashiness of streamflow hydrographs decreases with catchment area and increases with stream network density as would be expected 4 4 elasticities the elasticity ε 1 of streamflow relative to changes of the rainfall assuming d const equation 8 is characterized by a distinct spatial pattern fig 9 and fig 10 the elasticities ε 1 are shown in fig 9 as boxplots and in fig 10 as maps the sizes of the points in fig 10 represent the values of ε 1 for each gauged catchment at the catchment centroids the background pattern is generated by interpolation from these catchment values ordinary kriging and is intended to better highlight the regional patterns for t 2 y r s the rainfall streamflow relationships are highly elastic i e ε 1 1 in the lowlands in the north northeast and southeast e g northeastern convective rainfall region compared to the high alpine regions e g western orographic region where the elasticity is closer to unity i e ε 1 1 left boxplots of fig 9 and fig 10a in the glaciated regions of the highest summits of austria regions in red colors in fig 10 also see glaciated areas in fig 1a the relationships are inelastic ε 1 1 for a return period of t 100 y r s right boxplots in fig 9 and fig 10b the spatial pattern remains similar but the elasticities tend towards unity although our approach of analyzing the rainfall flood relationship refers to a comparison of distribution functions rather than individual events we additionally analyzed the synchronicity of the dates of annual rainfall and streamflow extremes in order to explore whether the event producing the largest annual streamflow are often the same as those producing the largest rainfall to this end stream gauges were compared to the nearest rain gauges with at least ten years of recording overlap fig a4 shows the percentage of annual rainfall and streamflow maxima that occurred within 24hrs of each other for the duration of 1hr left boxplots and 24hrs right boxplots stratified by rainfall regions the synchronicity of both durations is highest in the lowlands of the north and east which are regions of flashy catchment response represented by large η q fig a3f in these regions also elasticities ε 1 fig 9 are highest this is in line with our simulation experiments fig 3c which indicated small storage coefficients k to cause high elasticities ε 1 on the other hand synchronicities are smallest in the alpine regions e g western orographic region where values of η q are low the elasticity ε 2 of streamflow relative to rainfall changes assuming t const equation 11 is highest in the dry lowlands in the northeast and east northeastern convective and eastern mixed rainfall region fig 11 and fig 12 as in the case of fig 10 the sizes of the points in fig 12 represent the values of ε 2 for each gauged catchment at the catchment centroids while the background pattern is generated by interpolation from these catchment values ordinary kriging in these regions catchment concentration times tend to be short as indicated by high η q fig 7c and storm durations tend to be short indicated by high η p as high values η p indicate fast decrease of rainfall intensity with duration also indicated by the short average wet spell duration in fig a2b generally the closer ε 2 is to unity the more similar is the duration of flood triggering rainstorms and the concentration time of the catchment equation 11 on the other hand the elasticities ε 2 in the alpine regions e g northern orographic region are lower the pronounced similarities of the spatial patterns of ε 1 fig 10 and the location parameter of the streamflow ψ q fig a3d as well as the spatial patterns of ε 2 fig 12 and the scaling parameter of the streamflow η q fig a3f suggest that catchment processes dominate the runoff transformation since ε 1 is defined by the location parameters equation 9 and ε 2 by the scaling parameters equation 11 the dominance of catchment processes is also visible in the cumulative distribution functions of rainfall and streamflow fig 5 and fig 6 with more pronounced differences between the cdfs of the streamflow of different regions compared to the rainfall moreover the elasticity ε 1 t 2 y r s is positively correlated with the cv of the event runoff coefficients r c c v r s 0 59 and the skewness of the runoff coefficients r c c s r s 0 49 indicating that ε 1 is increased in regions of more variable and skewed runoff coefficients dunn s multiple comparison test table a1 reveals that there are no significant differences between ε 1 in the alpine western orographic and southern mixed regions the situation is similar for ε 2 where no statistically significant differences can be detected between the alpine western orographic northern orographic and southern mixed regions and between the northeastern convective and the eastern mixed regions as with the model parameters it appears that the regional differences of the elasticities can be broadly generalized into differences between the precipitation rich alps and the dry lowlands 5 discussion our analyses based on the concept of comparative hydrology unravel the most important factors including dominating rainfall and catchment characteristics that control the differences between the distributions of rainfall and streamflow extremes the moments and parameters of the rainfall distribution are aligned with the regional rainfall mechanisms in the high elevation catchments where orographic rainfall dominates the location parameter ψ p tends to be high and the scale parameter λ p tends to be small i e the rainfall extremes tend to be large with little temporal variability see fig a3a and a3c the opposite applies to catchments in the lowlands where convective rainfall extremes are more frequent the relationship between rainfall magnitude and variability is reflected by a high negative correlation between ψ p and λ p fig 4a and fig 8 r s 0 62 the regional rainfall mechanisms also manifest themselves in the spatial distribution of the scaling parameter η p which tends to be higher in the convective lowlands than in the mountainous regions with dominant orographic rainfall fig a3e a higher parameter η p implies that the intensity decreases more strongly with duration which can be expected for the short rainstorms that occur frequently in the lowlands as in the case of rainfall the location parameter of streamflow ψ q is higher in the mountain catchments than in the lowlands see fig a3d reflected by a strong positive correlation of ψ q with catchment elevation fig 8 r s 0 77 and mean summer rainfall fig 8 r s 0 55 this means the magnitude of floods tends to be higher in the orographic rainfall regions not only due the higher extreme rainfall magnitudes but also due to high annual rainfall amounts possibly leading to high soil moisture levels persistently high runoff coefficients and to a propensity towards saturation excess overflow the variability of streamflow represented by the scale parameter λ q however is controlled by catchment topography soil type and the geology e g correlations with slope r s 0 33 rendzina soils r s 0 21 or carbonate rock geology r s 0 28 fig 8 and is thus highest along the alpine ridge fig a3b while the variability of the rainfall represented by λ p is mainly controlled by elevation see negative correlation between λ p and elevation in fig 8 and is highest in the lowlands fig a3a some of the highest values of λ q relate to karstic catchments along the alpine divide see fig 1a catchments with crosses fig a3b and positive correlation between λ q and carbonate rock in fig 8 in karstic catchments during periods of average rainfall events most of the rainfall may be stored in the fractured carbonic rocks while more extreme rainfall events can saturate the epikarst zone inducing large streamflow extremes li et al 2017 and thus more variable floods such step changes in streamflow extremes may also occur in other geological formations rogger et al 2012 the scaling parameter η q fig a3f on the other hand is highest in the lowlands showing a similarity with the spatial distribution of the rainfall scaling parameter η p which is also lowest in the lowlands for the comparison of rainfall and flood distributions one can conclude not surprisingly that higher rainfall extremes tend to lead to higher floods as the positive correlation between the location parameters ψ p and ψ q indicates fig 8 r s 0 69 this relationship is more distinct in regions dominated by orographic rainfall where runoff coefficients are persistently high merz blöschl 2003 such as in the northern orographic region r s 0 70 the relationship is not existent in the northeastern convective region where runoff coefficients tend to be lower and more random merz blöschl 2003 r s 0 01 in this context the relationship between ψ p and elevation is also more distinct for the alpine orographic regions e g correlation between ψ p and elevation r s 0 81 in the northern orographic region than in the convective lowlands e g r s 0 35 in the northeastern convective region which is in line with barbero et al 2019 who found stronger positive correlation between expected values of daily rainfall compared to hourly rainfall as the former integrate large scale dynamics and orographic effects barbero et al 2019 since the cv is a direct function of the location parameter similar correlations apply between c v q and c v p in other words a steeper rainfall frequency curve is associated with a steeper flood frequency curve which is in line with previous studies e g merz blöschl 2003 smith et al 2011 villarini smith 2010 the scale parameter of rainfall is not aligned with that of streamflow reflected by r s 0 14 between λ p and λ q and different spatial patterns fig a3a a3b and fig 8 the spatial patterns of the scaling parameters η p and η q are to some extent aligned fig 8 r s 0 3 with larger parameters in the north and east and lower in the west this similarity suggests that the response times of catchments to the storms producing the annual floods tend to be shorter in regions dominated by convective activity north and northeast while the opposite is the case in the west the similarity is possibly due to an interplay of climatic and catchment processes over time modulated by the geology gaal et al 2012 for example the efficient drainage network in the southeast of austria leads to short response times and may have evolved from the dominating convective rainfall mechanisms in the region see for example high frequency of hailstorms in fig a1 as intense convective rainstorms increase the overland flow which in return influences the drainage network abrahams ponczynski 1984 tucker bras 2000 we quantified the relationship between rainfall and flood probabilities by elasticities ε 1 represents the percent change of flood discharge for a 1 in extreme rainfall change assuming duration d is constant elasticities ε 1 are highest in the dry lowlands in the northeast and southeast fig 9 and fig 10 for t 2 y r s they are more than four times higher than the mean of the alpine catchments that is in the dry lowlands flood frequency curves are considerably steeper than the rainfall frequency curves which is consistent with the regional analyses merz blöschl 2009a 2009b viglione et al 2009 suggested that in dry regions steep flood frequency curves can result from the occurrence of extraordinary events with runoff coefficients exceeding by far those of other events in the catchment gutknecht et al 2002 komma et al 2007 reflecting a highly skewed distribution of runoff coefficients in the mountainous catchments of the study region where annual rainfall is above 1000 mm yr 1 elasticities ε 1 are closer to unity fig 9 and fig 10 in these catchments the high orographic rainfall may frequently lead to soil saturation and thus event runoff coefficients tend to be high merz blöschl 2009b and therefore the steepness of the flood frequency curves is similar to that of the idf curves another possible explanation is the slower catchment response in parts of the high rainfall regions gaal et al 2012 as a result of a more pervious geology for example in the southern mixed rainfall zone where the phylitte geology reduces the response time fig 1c and thus may reduce elasticity as illustrated in the simulation experiment fig 3 this is because for slow response times the highest rainfall extreme of year and a given duration does not necessarily cause the highest flood peak in that year the lower correspondence of rainfall and flood events is also in line with their lower synchronicity fig a4 the decoupling is even more pronounced in the glaciated catchments fig 10 red areas where elasticities drop below unity as a consequence of glacier melt that is more relevant to floods than rainfall extremes ε 2 represents the percent change of flood discharge for a 1 change in extreme rainfall assuming the return period t is constant in the model ε 2 is represented by η q η p equation 11 i e the ratio of the temporal scaling of streamflow and extreme rainfall regions of high elasticities ε 2 are regions of fast catchment response as indicated by gaal et al 2012 which is aligned with values of η q and to some degree η p fig 11 fig 12 and fig a3f fast catchment response is mainly related to shallow soils and clay and marl and flysch geologies with low infiltration fig 1c as well as an efficient drainage network gaal et al 2012 holko et al 2011 in these regions also relevant storm durations tend to be short due to the dominance of convective rainfall which in combination with the fast catchment response explains the high elasticities ε 2 regions of low elasticities ε 2 on the other hand are those with slow catchment response as in the south of the country where the deeply weathered phylitte geology dominates while to our knowledge no regional data based studies on elasticities of streamflow extremes exist our results are in line with previous studies on elasticities of annual streamflow that show largest elasticities in dry climates e g chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 tang et al 2019 yang yang 2011 elasticities ε 1 tend towards unit elasticity with increasing return period as can be seen from equation 9 fig 9 and fig 10 this behavior is a consequence of the model formulation and fully consistent with hydrological reasoning for both infiltration excess and saturation excess mechanisms runoff tends to become more similar to rainfall as the rainfall intensity increases and if soil saturation is reached any additional rainfall transforms into surface runoff this behavior implies that the gradients of the tails of the flood and rainfall distribution become similar i e ε 1 1 which is the rationale behind the gradex method guillot 1993 merz blöschl 2008 naghettini et al 1996 our results suggest that this assumption is fully consistent with the combined intensity duration frequency analysis adopted here and found suitable for the austrian data given the similarity in runoff generation mechanism in terms of increasing runoff contributions with increasing return period mcdonnell 2013 it is possible that the tendency towards unit elasticity with increasing return period may hold in many regions throughout the world however it may be of interest to test the elasticity behavior using more complex models both similar combined models but with a larger number of parameters and joint distribution models such as copulae e g balistrocchi bacchi 2011 klein et al 2010 which allow for a more flexible description of the intensity duration frequency analysis in our analysis of elasticities we assumed that the return periods of rainfall and floods are the same this assumption seems natural given that it provides a common reference point for comparing distributions we also assumed that the durations of rainfall and floods are the same d q d p d however for the models adopted here eq 2 and 3 the elasticity ε 1 in fact does not depend on this assumption and is also valid for d q d p see also equation 9 as long as t q t p t d q c o n s t and d p c o n s t it is therefore equally valid for e g d q 1 h r approximately representing peak flow and d p 1 h r representing the various durations of the idf curve on the other hand for ε 2 d q d p d is a prerequisite while the assumption t q t p t is not necessary but t q c o n s t and t p c o n s t the independences of ε 1 on d and ε 2 on t result from the assumption of self affinity in the scaling models for rainfall and runoff equations 2 and 3 in which the same extreme value distribution is scaled by durations while these scaling models were found to be suitable for this study region this may not apply to other regions where other scaling models perhaps with more parameters may be more appropriate our work has various implications the sensitivity of floods to extreme rainfall as proposed here may be useful when extrapolating to flood frequency distributions beyond observed floods one possibility would be a bayesian framework costa fernandes 2017 viglione et al 2013 which allows incorporating this type of process based information for such applications it may be worth considering alternative distributions such as the gev that have more flexibility in the tail behavior in particular if the flood distribution is heavy tailed while the associated rainfall distribution is not the limiting elasticity may be greater than unity additionally there is potential for elasticity analyses in the context of climate impact studies analyzing long term changes of the elasticity of extremes may be useful for detecting long term variability in rainfall and streamflow time series to assist in hydrological model calibration for changing conditions duethmann et al 2020 lun et al 2020 more generally the elasticity of extremes may also be used as a benchmark tool for stochastic rainfall runoff modelling frameworks for example weather generators coupled with hydrological models e g bennett et al 2019 gao et al 2020 müller thomy sikorska 2019 okoli et al 2019 6 conclusion in this paper we present a new approach of comparing the rainfall flood relationship based on quantiles from intensity duration frequency models instead of comparing the rainfall flood relationship of individual events e g viglione et al 2009 we compare distribution functions of extreme rainfall and streamflow without event based linkages for this comparison we apply the elasticity concept to extreme rainfall and streamflow which sets the study apart from the traditional application of the elasticity to annual rainfall and streamflow e g chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 tang et al 2019 yang yang 2011 our results suggest that the extreme rainfall elasticity to floods behaves similarly to the annual rainfall elasticity to annual streamflow elasticities are higher in regions of low annual rainfall where rainfall events are primarily short and convective than in regions of high annual rainfall where rainfall events are longer and more often of orographic nature these regional differences of elasticities are related to a variety of factors including the long term climate topography soils and geology for example high elasticities in the dry regions are related to more variable and skewed event runoff coefficients which may be caused by the dominance of infiltration excess mechanisms associated with high rainfall intensities in future research it would be interesting to compare the proposed distribution based approach with event based approaches such as those of viglione et al 2009 to explore whether the elasticities identified here provide information on how return periods from rainfall and streamflow relate to each other for individual

4244,climate change intensifies hydrological cycle bringing critical challenges to the global and regional socio economic development here we used four global climate models to project future precipitation that drives hydrological modeling of future 30 year daily runoff in a large international river basin the lancang mekong river basin lmrb we applied four probability distribution functions to fit the flood peak and maximum 3 day flood volume series at four major hydrologic stations the copula function was used to establish the joint distribution between extreme precipitation and flood peak to estimate the impact of precipitation change on floods results show that annual maximum 30 day precipitation am30d and flood peak at pakse station are highly correlated future basin averaged am30d is projected to increase under most climate scenarios although am30d varies widely in spatial distribution the extreme values of am30d e g am1d and am3d in the future 2021 2050 are larger than those in historical period 1981 2004 the temporal distribution of future am30d is more uneven showing the bimodal distribution for the yun jinghong station large uncertainty is estimated in change of direction of annual maximum flood peak and maximum 3 day flood volume as for the other three stations they are all projected to have larger flood risks in spite of different magnitudes the larger the return period the larger the increase the greater the impact of climate change the change of basin averaged am30d precipitation in the future will lead to the increase of flood peak at pakse station via the bivariate frequency analysis from the perspective of water conservancy project safety considering the adverse principle flood control design according to the design results derived from the joint distribution of two variables between am30d and flood peak can reduce the risk of flood disaster this study can provide scientific reference and basis for flood control and disaster reduction and water resources cooperation policy development in lmrb keywords climate change extreme precipitation extreme floods lancang mekong river basin lmrb 1 introduction climate change has accelerated hydrological cycle and modified hydrological processes bringing severe disasters such as high temperatures droughts and floods at both regional hallegatte et al 2013 hidalgo et al 2013 and global scales hirabayashi et al 2013 zhang and cai 2013 flood disaster is one of the most frequent and serious disasters in the world hirabayashi et al 2013 mokrech et al 2015 accounting for one fifth of the total loss of natural disasters specifically flood disaster interferes with human society and economy in many aspects such as human health safety of life and property ecological environment according to the assessment reports produced by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the evolution of flood disaster induced by climate change has become a major issue worldwide ipcc 2012 ipcc 2018 in recent years projections of flood regime are a common concern in the study of climate change and special care is taken to use climate model outputs to drive hydrological modeling this coupling between climate and hydrologic models is expected to lead to a better assessment of change in the hydrological cycle dankers and feyen 2008 have assessed the impact of climate change on flood hazard in europe using one regional climate model rcm to force lisflood hydrological model and find that extreme discharge levels might increase in magnitude and frequency by the end of this century under the special report on emission scenarios sres a2 emission scenario grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 have used eight bias corrected gcms as an input for a hydrological model to project percentile runoff under two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in the upper ayerawaddy basin myanmar and find that low flows will have high variability while high flows have higher mean values than that of baseline hoang et al 2016 have used several gcms to simulate future precipitation and temperature and gev distribution to fit yearly peak flows finally find that extremely high flow events will increase in both magnitude and frequency in all stations of lmrb during 2036 2065 with comparison with that of baseline 1971 2000 with the implementation of the belt and road initiative and the establishment of the china indochina peninsula international economic cooperation corridor hu and zhong 2019 southeast asian countries have received increasing attention as an important transboundary river the lancang mekong river basin lmrb flows across five southeast asian countries however due to climate change flood disasters will be more frequent in the lmrb thereby causing unbearable difficulties for livelihood agriculture fisheries and natural property therefore it is necessary to fully understand the possible flood disasters in the lmrb under future scenarios and assess the impacts of climate change on extreme flood events the assessment will provide insights to improve existing plans and policies and will be helpful to evaluate the rationality and sustainability of cooperation mechanism of water resources in the basin recent studies from kiem et al 2008 and hoang et al 2016 have assessed the impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime in lmrb these studies have projected annual and monthly flows as well as extreme high flows and extreme low flows and showed a generally consistent conclusion that mean flows and extreme flows will increase in the future but the changes are spatially and temporally different across the basin however for the projections of extreme events it is not enough to focus on one variable to accurately project the changes of each characteristic variable and their correlations so multivariate distribution models need to be introduced to project the changes of extreme events mou et al 2020 as a tool that can build multivariate joint distributions based on the marginal part of univariate the copula function has been intensively used in multivariate hydrologic analysis salvadori and de michele 2004 zhang and singh 2007 for extreme hydrological events extreme value sample pairs mostly consider the variables of the event itself in terms of drought studies consider the joint distribution of drought duration drought intensity and drought severity e g saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 zhang et al 2015 dai et al 2020 xu et al 2021 while flood duration flood peak and flood volume are considered in establishing the joint distribution for flood event e g jeong et al 2014 genest et al 2007 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 sraj et al 2015 in fact it may be important to project the changes of extreme hydrological events with altering climate factors e g precipitation and temperature under climate change therefore a multivariate model that can link climate factors and extreme hydrological events is needed to capture the correlation structure between them and then to better characterize the relationship between climate factors and extreme hydrological events and to project the future trends of extreme events the aim of the study is to project future flood characteristics and assess the impact of precipitation change on floods in lmrb under climate change the remainder of the study is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and climate data including observed ones and simulated ones derived from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate scenarios section 3 is devoted to bias correction method hydrological modelling univariate and bivariate frequency analysis method in section 4 extreme precipitation and floods is projected and the impact of precipitation change on floods is assessed under climate change we perform detailed discussion in section 5 and conclude our conclusions in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river originates from the tibetan plateau and flows through six countries i e china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam before discharging to the south china sea fig 1 a the upper reaches of the lancang mekong river locating in china is called the lancang river and the downstream is known as the mekong river fig 1 a the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is located between 8 to 34 n and 94 e to 110 e fig 1 b with the length of 4 800 km the drainage area of over 795 000 km2 and the annual discharge of 14 500 m3 s elevation ranges from over 5000 m in the tibetan plateau to only a few meters above sea level in the downstream river delta hoang et al 2016 so the basin has rich hydropower resources it is worth mentioning that the study area of this study is the watershed above the pakse hydrological station fig 1 b since we only assess hydrological changes down to pakse station we exclude the downstream area below this station i e south of latitude 15 n the topography conditions in the basin are changeable the distribution characteristics of climate and water resources between the upper and lower reaches are quite different kingston et al 2011 annual average precipitation is relatively high but unevenly distributed in space and time for lancang river basin plateau climate and subtropical monsoon climate are dominant zhong et al 2019 precipitation is mainly concentrated in june to august accounting for more than 60 of the annual precipitation the runoff recharge is dominated by precipitation and snowmelt for mekong river basin the climate type is mainly tropical rainforest climate and tropical monsoon climate precipitation is concentrated in september and october accounting for more than 75 of the annual precipitation the runoff recharge mainly consists of upstream water tributary water and precipitation thompson et al 2013 hoang et al 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate data we prepare climate data for the baseline 1981 2004 and the future period 2021 2050 using various datasets global daily precipitation data from climate prediction center unified gauge based analysis hereinafter referred to as cpc are used as observations cpc precipitation data at a 0 5 resolution are composed of the measured data and the remote sensing satellite data with high accuracy cui et al 2017 sun et al 2018 meteorological data such as temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation are from 28 meteorological stations fig 1 the global climate models gcms selected in this study are derived from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip 2b protocol which provides four gcms from cmip5 and three emission scenarios i e rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in detail the four gcms are geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory s earth system model 2 m gfdl esm2m hereinafter referred to as gfdl hadley global environment model 2 earth system hadgem2 es hereinafter referred to as had institute pierre simon laplace climate model 5a low resolution ipsl cm5a lr hereinafter referred to as ipsl and the model for interdisciplinary research on climate 5 miroc5 hereinafter referred to as mir these climate models are used because they provide detailed daily climate data fine spatial scale and some of them have been proved to perform well in reproducing historical tropical precipitation conditions in lmrb hasson et al 2016 sillmann et al 2013 2 2 2 hydrological data the hydrological data used in this study are from four hydrological stations in lmrb namely the yun jinghong station the luang prabang station the vientiane station and the pakse station shown in fig 1 these data are obtained from mrc s hydrological database mrc 2011 with the time series from 1979 to 2004 3 methods the flowchart of our climate change impact assessments is displayed in fig 2 on which there are four modules the extreme precipitation module screens extreme precipitation index based on the correlation between maximum rainfall with different durations and flood peaks and projects its future trend based on corrected gcms global climate models outputs the hydrological module simulates and projects future streamflow using the swat soli and water assessment tool hydrological model the extreme flood module selects the optimal marginal distribution functions for annual maximum flood peak and volume at four hydrological stations and project the flood characteristics the impact assessment module mainly analyzes the impact of precipitation change on floods via copula function 3 1 bias correction given the systematic errors of gcms their outputs are often not directly applicable as input for hydrological models previous studies have shown that the quantile mapping qm method is more suitable for gcm bias correction block et al 2009 teutschbein and seibert 2012 thus qm method is used to correct daily precipitation simulations from four gcms in this study the theory of qm method is to correct the distribution function of gcm outputs to agree with that of observations which can be done by creating a transfer function with the non parametric conversion method piani et al 2010 3 2 hydrological model swat model is a distributed hydrological model with the detailed physical basis which is suitable for complex large watershed with different soil land use and management conditions arnold et al 1998 when simulating runoff swat model can divide a catchment into a number of sub basins according to the threshold area which defines the minimum drainage area required to form the origin of a stream muleta and nicklow 2005 within the sub basins different hydrological response units hrus can be built with consideration of the combinations of land use soil and management muleta and nicklow 2005 the simulated hydrological process is carried out on the sub basins and hrus and then discharge at the outlet of the basin is simulated based on the principle of water balance in this study we use swat model to simulate daily discharge in lmrb because previous studies e g piman et al 2013 have proved its good simulation performance in this basin we extract the topographic and watershed boundaries of the study area using the dem data of rtmdemutm with a resolution of 90 m http www gscloud cn moreover based on the 1 km spatial resolution of land use data provided by the university of maryland https www osgeo cn map mrc81 and the soil property data provided by the harmonized world soil database http webarchive iiasa ac at research luc external world soil database html we delineate the lmrb into 411 hrus according to the time series length of the hydrological data this study sets 1979 and 1980 as the warm up years 1981 1992 as the calibration period and 1993 2004 as the validation period the hydrological model performance is assessed using two indexes namely the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns between simulations and observations and the relative error re of multi year average discharges furthermore relative error values of flood peak fp and flood volume fv between simulations and observations are used to evaluate the hydrological model performance in simulating the flood events 3 3 distribution function this study applies several common distribution functions to fit precipitation and flood series respectively such as gamma pearson iii gamma for precipitation series p iii for flood series generalized extreme value gev lognormal and loglogistic for p iii distribution probability weighted moments pwm is used to estimate the parameters pwm provided by greenwood et al 1979 has perfect statistical characteristics so it has been widely used in parameter estimation of p iii distribution jing et al 1989 song and ding 1988 as for the other distribution functions maximum likelihood estimation mle is used to estimate parameters in this study hosking and wallis 1988 kolmogorov smirnov k s test is used to evaluate the fitting goodness by comparing the empirical frequency distribution of sample data with a specific theoretical distribution if the difference is smaller than the critical value it is inferred that the sample is subject to the specific distribution as a goodness of fit test algorithm anderson darling a d test is also to see the deviation between empirical distribution and theoretical distribution similarly if the a d value is less than the critical value the samples are considered to conform to the theoretical distribution 3 4 copula function due to the complexity of flood phenomena univariate frequency methods cannot meet the requirements of flood characteristics in the past decades scholars have proposed various multivariate analysis methods for flood characteristics yin et al 2018a 2018b salvadori and de michele 2004 constructing multivariate distributions via copula functions has become a popular method for identifying flood features from a multivariate perspective jeong et al 2014 zhang and singh 2007 this approach has the advantage of capturing independently the dependence structure of the marginal distribution between random variables and incorporating different flood characteristics including duration flood peak and flood volume flood risk can be projected more comprehensively by establishing the joint distribution of multiple flood characteristics wang et al 2020 most previous studies have established multivariate statistical models from the extreme events themselves such as considering the joint distribution of flood duration peak and volume for flood risk assessment genest et al 2007 jeong et al 2014 genest et al 2007 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 sraj et al 2015 under climate change it is particularly important to analyze changes in the probability of occurrence of hydrological extreme events when climate factors e g precipitation temperature change therefore the multivariate model that can link climate elements and extreme hydrological events is needed to establish this study focuses on extreme precipitation and extreme flood to investigate the joint probability of flood occurrence under climate change via the copula function eq 1 there are many types of copula functions among which archimedean copula function is widely used in hydrological multivariate frequency analysis zhang and singh 2006 the copula functions used in this study are three common archimedean copula functions namely gumbel clayton and frank karmakar and simonovic 2009 the parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method akaike information criteria aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse latif and mustafa 2021 are used to evaluate the fitting goodness of copula functions with the smaller the value the better the fitting effect within the copula based framework different definitions of joint return periods have been proposed such as or and kendall dynamic structure based return periods and so on salvadori et al 2013 shi et al 2020 mirabbasi et al 2012 among these the or case is usually adopted in flood occurrence assessment eq 2 yin et al 2020 1 f x y p x x y y c f x x f y y c u v 2 t x x o r y y 1 1 c f x x f y y 1 1 c u v where f x y represents joint distribution function fx x represents the marginal distribution function of variable x fy y is the same fx x but for variable y c u v represents the copula function t x x o r y y represents the joint return period 4 results 4 1 adaptability analysis of gcms to increase the confidence in future projections it is significant to assess the adaptability of gcms this study compares the difference between the simulations of bias corrected gcms and the observations on daily monthly and yearly time scale respectively four statistical indicators i e mean value mean standard deviation sd mann kendall m k and correlation coefficient r were calculated for daily precipitation series and the results are shown in fig 3 a the daily average precipitation derived from bias corrected gcms is greatly consistent with the observed one and sd values are very close with all around 4 an insignificant increase trend simulated by each gcm is also similar to that of observations the r values between the simulated and the observed greatly increase from 0 1 to 0 4 after bias correction for daily precipitation from fig 3 b the four gcms all capture well with observed monthly precipitation the simulated monthly precipitation in rainy season from may to october is slightly higher than the measured monthly precipitation but the opposite is true in dry season from november to april of the following year the spatial distributions of simulated mean annual precipitation from gcms are consistent with the observed one fig 4 from upstream to downstream mean annual precipitation increases from 200 to 2000 mm moreover precipitation in the eastern part is higher than that in the west these results indicate that all bias corrected gcms have good performance in simulating precipitation in the lmrb 4 2 changes in extreme precipitation for 2021 2050 we calculate the annual maximum precipitation over the basin for consecutive n days n 5 10 15 as the extreme precipitation index in this study three correlation coefficients i e pearson kendall and spearman are applied to evaluate the correlation between the extreme precipitation index and the annual maximum flood peak discharges at the pakse station form the table 1 the annual maximum 30 day precipitation am30d achieves the highest correlation with the annual maximum flood peak discharges at the pakse station table 1 therefore this section focuses on the projection of the changes of am30d four probability distribution functions i e gamma gev lognormal and loglogistic are applied to fit the am30d series the results show gev distribution is more suitable than the others table 4 which is consistent with kawagoe et al 2010 and ono et al 2013 therefore gev distribution is applied to project the changes of am30d in future period 2021 2050 compared to historical period 1981 2004 under different return periods in this study table 2 shows the future changes of basin averaged am30d in comparison with historical period under different return periods it can be seen that the changes of am30d have different magnitude even different direction under different climate scenarios under rcp2 6 scenario the ascend trends of am30d are projected by gfdl and mir climate models while had and ipsl climate models project the descend trends for am30d under rcp6 0 scenario all climate model projections show ascend trends except for the descend trend projected by ipsl climate model under rcp8 5 scenario all but gfdl climate models project am30d with ascend trends from all gcms and rcps the basin averaged am30d will more likely increase due to more climate scenarios with the ascend projections take the 100 year return period as an example the changes in am30d between the two periods future and baseline vary spatially in lmrb under different gcms or rcps fig 5 table 3 shows the number of grid with ascend trend of am30d and its share of the total grid points under each climate scenario under rcp2 6 scenario gfdl and mir climate models project an increasing trend of am30d in the lancang river basin and an interval of positive and negative trends in the mekong river basin while had and ipsl climate models project a decreasing trend of am30d in most of the whole basin especially in the mekong river basin under rcp6 0 scenario the percentage of area with an ascend trend of am30d projected by gfdl had and ipsl climate models are 64 4 73 30 and 64 40 respectively mir climate model projections show a descend trend in the lancang river basin and the eastern part of the lower mekong river under rcp8 5 scenario am30d shows an ascend trend across the basin projected by mir climate model from the last column of table 3 the mean area percentage increases with increasing emission scenario in terms of gcms gfdl climate model projections always show the ascend trend in the lancang river basin especially in the lower lancang river basin while the descend trend in the eastern part of the lower mekong river basin had climate model projection directions have no obvious consistence in the spatial distribution under three emission scenarios ipsl climate model projections show the descend trend in the local area of the upper lancang river and the upper mekong basin while the ascend trend in the other area of the whole basin mir climate model projections show the ascend trend in the middle mekong river basin from the last row of the table 3 the mean area percentages of gfdl and mir climate models are relatively larger from all climate scenarios the situation that the area percentage with the higher am30d projections is larger than that with opposite direction projections is more common this suggest drainage area am30d will increase in the future but for the local regions within the basin am30d projections vary greatly between gcms or rcps 4 3 assessment of the swat model the swat simulated and measured daily runoff processes agree well in both the calibration and validation periods with all ns values over 0 7 and most re values within 10 fig 6 the re values at the yun jinghong station are relatively large i e 12 48 and 17 27 for model calibration and validation respectively but still within the satisfactory range of 25 moriasi et al 2007 this is likely due to the underestimated glacier and snow melting in the source water area of the lancang river kiem et al 2005 to further evaluate the flood simulation performance of the swat model in the lmrb we select 10 flood events at each station the re of flood peak fp and flood volume fv between the simulations and the observations are compared respectively we show that the re values are all within 10 at the four stations and the shapes of observed flood processes are generally captured well fig a 1 therefore we can conclude that the swat model is suitable for our modelling analyses 4 4 changes in extreme floods for 2021 2050 this section discusses the changes of frequency and magnitude of the annual maximum peak discharge and maximum 3 day flood volume as the indices of extreme floods at the four hydrological stations under different gcms and rcps the k s test and a d test are used to evaluate the fitting goodness of four probability distribution functions and the results are shown in table 4 all these distribution functions statistical values are lower than the critical values and show good fitting for each station specifically the lognormal distribution is more suitable for the yun jinghong station and pakse station while the gev distribution has better performance for the luang prabang station and the vientiane station the optimal distribution functions are adopted for fitting flood peak and flood volume at four hydrological stations respectively fig 7 table 5 gives the percentage change of flood peak and 3 day flood volume under various return periods the results show a much more varied pattern of the changes in flood frequency across the lmrb than may have been expected from the upstream and downstream of the basin the future flood risk of yun jinghong station on the upper lancang river is uncertain while the future flood risk of the three hydrological stations on the lower mekong river namely luang prabang vientiane and pakse stations is projected to be higher at yun jinghong station half of the climate scenarios project that the annual maximum flood peak and 3 day flood volume show the descend trends while half of the climate scenarios project the opposite directions at the three downstream hydrological stations namely luang prabang vientiane and pakse stations the future flood peak and 3 day flood volumes are projected to increase under all climate scenarios which is consistent with the previous study kiem et al 2008 moreover the larger the return period the larger the increase the greater the impact of climate change from the emission scenario the increase of flood peak and flood volume under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios is greater than that under rcp6 0 scenario from the climate model gfdl climate model projects the largest increase in future flood risk while had climate model has the smallest projections although most climate models project that future basin averaged am30d will show an increasing trend there are still some climate models project basin averaged am30d in the opposite direction table 2 for example am30d projections decrease derived from ipsl climate model under rcp2 6 scenario in the future period 2021 2050 however the future flood peaks projected by the same climate scenario show an increasing trend table 5 this study tries to explain the reasons for this phenomenon ipsl climate model is taken as an example to illustrate fig 8 shows the historical simulations and future projections derived from ipsl under rcp2 6 scenario for 6 flood processes the flood peak of each flood process is the corresponding annual maximum flood peak and the corresponding basin average am30d distribution the temporal distribution of am30d during the historical period is relatively even while am30d is hugely uneven during the future period moreover the extreme value e g am1d and am3d is larger and am30d shows the bimodal distribution during the future period table 6 shows the value standard deviation sd of am30d and flood peak corresponding to the 6 flood processes compared with baseline future am30d value decreases under the some climate scenarios but the standard deviation increases and the flood peak is larger therefore we suggest although the am30d value will decrease under the some climate scenarios but its distribution will be more extreme i e more uneven much higher am1d and am3d and bimodal distribution leading to higher flood risk 4 5 the impact of climate change on floods the climate conditions change rapidly within lmrb räsänen and kummu 2013 the climatic zone of the basin spans between the alpine and tropical zones the upstream of the study area namely lancang river basin is located in the qinghai tibet plateau and the climate system is relatively stable kiem et al 2008 the downstream of the study area namely mekong river basin is located in the prevalent east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon zones with a complex and variable climate system delgado et al 2012 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 the runoff sources in the upstream and downstream are different precipitation and snowmelt are the runoff sources in lancang river while precipitation is the main runoff source in mekong river mekong river has many tributaries and its tributaries hold a large amount of water lauri et al 2012 wang et al 2017 hecht et al 2019 there are 22 tributaries with watershed area greater than 5000 km2 in the whole basin kuenzer et al 2013 extreme precipitation is the main driver of flood hazards in the lower mekong river and is indicative in identifying the causes of flood events therefore it is very important to consider the impact of precipitation change on the floods in the downstream which can provide important value reference for flood control and disaster reduction in the basin copula function is a bridge that links univariate distributions to multivariate distributions and can construct multivariate distribution with different marginal distribution zhang et al 2015 copula function can consider the nonlinear relationship between variables salvadori and de michele 2004 sadegh et al 2018 therefore this section uses copula function to establish the multivariable model that can connect precipitation and flood events so as to capture the connection and related structure between them and then project the future floods according to section 4 2 we know that am30d and flood peak at pakse station have the highest correlation so the joint distribution between the two variable is investigated to estimate the impact of climate change on floods from section 4 2 and section 4 4 it is believed that the optimal marginal probability distributions for precipitation and flood series are gev and lognormal distribution functions respectively then three copula functions are selected to fit the pairs of variables the copula function with the best fitting is determined by the smallest rmse aic and bic as shown in table 7 the three evaluation indices for the frank copula are the smallest so the frank copula is selected to construct the two dimensional joint distribution model to clearly show the impact of climate change on floods we compare the projected flood peaks between univariate distribution and bivariate joint distribution under the same return periods based on the equal frequency between precipitation and flood peak under the joint distribution u fx x v fy y this study projects flood peak discharges under different return periods fig 9 and table a 1 show the projection values and percentage changes of flood peak under different joint return periods respectively comparing table 5 and table a 1 for pakse station the future changes of flood peaks have similar characteristics in univariate and bivariate joint distributions both predict that the intensity and frequency of extreme floods will increase in the future however the univariate frequency analysis projects the lower value for flood peak than that derived from the bivariate frequency analysis considering am30d precipitation under the same return periods and climate scenarios in other words the future flood peak derived from the bivariate frequency analysis is much higher whether it is compared to the results of bivariate frequency analysis in the historical period or the results of univariate frequency analysis in the future period it indicates the change of basin averaged am30d precipitation in the future will lead to the increase of flood peak at pakse station the results derived from the bivariate joint distribution are biased towards safety from the perspective of water conservancy project safety considering the adverse principle flood control design according to the design results derived from the joint distribution of two variables between am30d and flood peak can reduce the risk of flood disaster 5 discussion in terms of the relationship between the annual maximum flood peak discharge and extreme precipitation of various durations amnd we show that the annual maximum 30 day precipitation am30d has the highest correlation with annual maximum flood peak this can be explained by that the shape of basin is long and narrow so precipitation takes about one month to converge to the downstream mrc 2006 delgado et al 2010 thompson et al 2013 most climate scenarios show an increasing trend of future basin average am30d although am30d varies widely in spatial distribution however some climate scenarios predict a decreasing trend of am30d further investigating the distribution characteristics of am30d under these climate scenarios this study finds that the extreme values of am30d e g am1d and am3d in the future are larger than that in historical period this study also finds that the temporal distribution of future am30d is more uneven showing the bimodal distribution this will lead to the higher risk of extreme flooding in the basin univariate frequency analysis shows that the flood risk will increase in the future multivariate frequency analysis considers more factors and gets more reliable results under the background of climate change the joint distribution of precipitation and flood is established via copula function compared with the results of bivariate frequency analysis in the historical period the future flood peak derived from bivariate frequency analysis will increase significantly suggesting extreme flood risk in the basin will increase compared with the results of univariate frequency analysis in the future period the bivariate frequency analysis also projects the much higher flood peak in the future indicating the results of the bivariate joint distribution are biased towards safety xu et al 2021 the design results derived from the bivariate joint distribution should be considered for policy makers and programme managers when making decisions about the design standard for flood prevention and safety of dams to reduce the risk of flood disaster mou et al 2020 we show that future climate change is expected to alter the hydrological regime in the lmrb with good agreement with the previous studies e g eastham et al 2008 mrc 2010 kingston et al 2011 chen et al 2021 due to huge hydropower potential in the lmrb riparian countries have built large numbers of dams in its mainstream and tributaries and are planning to build more dams king et al 2007 mrc 2009 both climate change and hydropower exploitation have influenced the flood regime in the lmrb but the impact on directions of flood peak change is opposite climate change will cause an increase in future flood peak while hydropower will result in reduced future flood peaks and increased dry season runoff lauri et al 2012 have found the influence of hydropower construction on the monthly average runoff at kratie station in lmrb will be greater than that of climate change in 2032 2042 that is the future monthly runoff shows a decreasing trend gcm outputs driving different hydrological models is a popular approach for climate change impact assessment however a variety uncertainty is introduced in such an assessment process including emission scenarios gcm structures downscaling methods and hydrological modelling hydrological model structures and parameters kingston et al 2011 thompson et al 2013 wilby and harris 2006 have found the following order of component significance greatest to least gcm empirical downscaling method hydrological model structure hydrological model parameters emission scenario when projecting low flow in the thames river and the likelihood of a reduction in summer low flows by the 2080 s is 76 for the conditional experiment in which weights are specified for each component of uncertainty on the basis of a very limited set of gcms four gcms however some studies have found that emission scenario uncertainty is significant second only to gcm structures prudhomme and davies 2009 vetter et al 2017 moreover the order of significance of uncertainty sources is related to the study area kay et al 2009 have compared the sources of uncertainty in the impact of climate change on floods in the southeast and northwest basins in england and found that the emission scenario is less significant in the former basin while particularly significant in the latter basin ranking second prudhomme and davies 2009 have suggested that hydrological uncertainty varies significantly between catchments overall there is a clear view that gcm structure uncertainty are the greatest among these uncertainty sources kingston et al 2011 and these uncertainty sources are different only by orders of significance but not by the order of magnitude this is also the case in the lancang mekong river kingston et al 2011 thompson et al 2013 due to the large uncertainty in the precipitation simulated by gcms the data from multiple gcms are usually used to drive hydrological modeling however it is not clear how to make the best choice of gcms with the gradual release of gcms outputs from ipcc ar6 the impact assessment of current and future climate change using a new generation of climate models and emission scenarios is being carried out the simulation data from ipcc ar6 is more abundant however whether or not we can reasonably use these new datasets to increase the confidence in impact assessment is uncertain at this point there are abundant groundwater resources in the basin mrc 2006 for example groundwater in the mekong delta supplies water for domestic use urban water supply irrigation aquaculture and industrial sites about 4 5 million people depend upon groundwater for drinking the relationship between recharge and discharge is often dynamic and seasonal spellman et al 2019 during the wet season floodwaters may have a higher hydraulic head and consequently water will move from the floodwaters into the aquifer system recharge in the dry season when river levels are low water will gradually flow from the aquifer system into the river discharge climate change will cause an increase in annual runoff across the basin which will increase groundwater recharge and reduce the use of groundwater resources however in some areas such as the mekong delta due to the influence of human activities a large amount of groundwater is exploited which greatly increases the recharge of groundwater from surface water buschmann et al 2008 erban et al 2014 the surface runoff is reduced the exploitation rate is far greater than the recharge rate resulting in land subsidence most of the delta lies within 2 m of current sea level and is highly vulnerable to the additive effects of regional pumping induced land subsidence and sea level rise due to climate change erban et al 2014 recent research has documented the effects of direct human activities such as groundwater mining and contamination on groundwater resources in the mekong delta buschmann et al 2008 the effects of climate change whether caused by human activities or natural variability on surface water resources and associated ecosystems have been evaluated in the basin costa cabral et al 2008 hoang et al 2016 ishidaira et al 2008 keskinen et al 2010 tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 however little is known about how subsurface waters in the vadose zone and groundwater might response to climate change and affect the current availability and future sustainability of groundwater resources in the study area green et al 2007 thus there are urgent and ongoing needs to address the expected coupled effects of human activities and climate change on basin wide groundwater resources the lancang mekong river basin is the key region of geopolitical game and economic cooperation in asia kuenzer et al 2013 the change of water resources in the basin is closely related to the life of hundreds of millions of people ziv et al 2012 extreme events are more frequent under climate change in the region the increasing frequency and duration of drought and flood events in the future period will affect the potential of water resources cooperation of the riparian countries under climate change it is necessary to carry out in depth regional water resources management and cooperation of the riparian countries the construction of hundreds of large reservoirs in the basin by china laos vietnam and cambodia has improved the water resources regulation capacity and improved the current spatiotemporal distribution of water resources in the basin hecht et al 2019 however the dramatically increased flood risk in the future will bring new challenges to the management of flood events in the basin the riparian countries must consider the basin as an integrated system with linkages between groundwater and surface hydrology farming systems and environmental health when developing and utilizing water resources ziv et al 2012 arias et al 2012 meanwhile it is of significance for riparian countries to actively promote the joint operation of multi reservoir flood control to deal with the frequent flood disasters in the future kuenzer et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the riparian countries must coordinate cooperate and make sustainable use of water resources to achieve greater resiliency to climate change 6 conclusions based on the four cmip5 gcm outputs this study uses qm method to correct gcm precipitation outputs and projects extreme precipitation variation in the lmrb swat model is set up to simulate daily discharge across the study area several distribution functions are selected to fit flood series at four hydrological stations to predict univariate flood frequency variation moreover the copula function is used to build the joint distribution of precipitation and flood to reflect the impact of climate change on floods the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 these bias corrected gcms have good performance in simulating precipitation in lmrb the basin averaged am30d and flood peak at pakse station have the highest correlation coefficient most climate scenarios show an increasing trend of future basin averaged am30d although am30d varies widely in spatial distribution the extreme values of am30d e g am1d and am3d in the future are larger than that in historical period the temporal distribution of future am30d is more uneven showing the bimodal distribution 2 the swat hydrological model can well reproduce daily discharge and flood process with high ns and low re values at the four hydrological stations 3 for the yun jinghong station large uncertainty is estimated in change of direction of annual maximum flood peak and maximum 3 day flood volume as for the other three stations they are all projected to have larger flood risks in spite of different magnitudes the larger the return period the larger the increase the greater the impact of climate change the increase of flood peak and flood volume under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios is greater than that under rcp6 0 scenario gfdl climate model projects the largest increase in future flood risk while had climate model has the smallest projections 4 the future flood peak derived from the bivariate frequency analysis is much higher whether it is compared to the results of bivariate frequency analysis in the historical period or the results of univariate frequency analysis in the future period this suggests the change of basin averaged am30d precipitation in the future will lead to the increase of flood peak at pakse station from the perspective of water conservancy project safety considering the adverse principle flood control design according to the design results derived from the joint distribution of two variables between am30d and flood peak can reduce the risk of flood disaster credit authorship contribution statement shuxia wang conceptualization methodology formal analysis software writing original draft

4244,climate change intensifies hydrological cycle bringing critical challenges to the global and regional socio economic development here we used four global climate models to project future precipitation that drives hydrological modeling of future 30 year daily runoff in a large international river basin the lancang mekong river basin lmrb we applied four probability distribution functions to fit the flood peak and maximum 3 day flood volume series at four major hydrologic stations the copula function was used to establish the joint distribution between extreme precipitation and flood peak to estimate the impact of precipitation change on floods results show that annual maximum 30 day precipitation am30d and flood peak at pakse station are highly correlated future basin averaged am30d is projected to increase under most climate scenarios although am30d varies widely in spatial distribution the extreme values of am30d e g am1d and am3d in the future 2021 2050 are larger than those in historical period 1981 2004 the temporal distribution of future am30d is more uneven showing the bimodal distribution for the yun jinghong station large uncertainty is estimated in change of direction of annual maximum flood peak and maximum 3 day flood volume as for the other three stations they are all projected to have larger flood risks in spite of different magnitudes the larger the return period the larger the increase the greater the impact of climate change the change of basin averaged am30d precipitation in the future will lead to the increase of flood peak at pakse station via the bivariate frequency analysis from the perspective of water conservancy project safety considering the adverse principle flood control design according to the design results derived from the joint distribution of two variables between am30d and flood peak can reduce the risk of flood disaster this study can provide scientific reference and basis for flood control and disaster reduction and water resources cooperation policy development in lmrb keywords climate change extreme precipitation extreme floods lancang mekong river basin lmrb 1 introduction climate change has accelerated hydrological cycle and modified hydrological processes bringing severe disasters such as high temperatures droughts and floods at both regional hallegatte et al 2013 hidalgo et al 2013 and global scales hirabayashi et al 2013 zhang and cai 2013 flood disaster is one of the most frequent and serious disasters in the world hirabayashi et al 2013 mokrech et al 2015 accounting for one fifth of the total loss of natural disasters specifically flood disaster interferes with human society and economy in many aspects such as human health safety of life and property ecological environment according to the assessment reports produced by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the evolution of flood disaster induced by climate change has become a major issue worldwide ipcc 2012 ipcc 2018 in recent years projections of flood regime are a common concern in the study of climate change and special care is taken to use climate model outputs to drive hydrological modeling this coupling between climate and hydrologic models is expected to lead to a better assessment of change in the hydrological cycle dankers and feyen 2008 have assessed the impact of climate change on flood hazard in europe using one regional climate model rcm to force lisflood hydrological model and find that extreme discharge levels might increase in magnitude and frequency by the end of this century under the special report on emission scenarios sres a2 emission scenario grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 have used eight bias corrected gcms as an input for a hydrological model to project percentile runoff under two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in the upper ayerawaddy basin myanmar and find that low flows will have high variability while high flows have higher mean values than that of baseline hoang et al 2016 have used several gcms to simulate future precipitation and temperature and gev distribution to fit yearly peak flows finally find that extremely high flow events will increase in both magnitude and frequency in all stations of lmrb during 2036 2065 with comparison with that of baseline 1971 2000 with the implementation of the belt and road initiative and the establishment of the china indochina peninsula international economic cooperation corridor hu and zhong 2019 southeast asian countries have received increasing attention as an important transboundary river the lancang mekong river basin lmrb flows across five southeast asian countries however due to climate change flood disasters will be more frequent in the lmrb thereby causing unbearable difficulties for livelihood agriculture fisheries and natural property therefore it is necessary to fully understand the possible flood disasters in the lmrb under future scenarios and assess the impacts of climate change on extreme flood events the assessment will provide insights to improve existing plans and policies and will be helpful to evaluate the rationality and sustainability of cooperation mechanism of water resources in the basin recent studies from kiem et al 2008 and hoang et al 2016 have assessed the impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime in lmrb these studies have projected annual and monthly flows as well as extreme high flows and extreme low flows and showed a generally consistent conclusion that mean flows and extreme flows will increase in the future but the changes are spatially and temporally different across the basin however for the projections of extreme events it is not enough to focus on one variable to accurately project the changes of each characteristic variable and their correlations so multivariate distribution models need to be introduced to project the changes of extreme events mou et al 2020 as a tool that can build multivariate joint distributions based on the marginal part of univariate the copula function has been intensively used in multivariate hydrologic analysis salvadori and de michele 2004 zhang and singh 2007 for extreme hydrological events extreme value sample pairs mostly consider the variables of the event itself in terms of drought studies consider the joint distribution of drought duration drought intensity and drought severity e g saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 zhang et al 2015 dai et al 2020 xu et al 2021 while flood duration flood peak and flood volume are considered in establishing the joint distribution for flood event e g jeong et al 2014 genest et al 2007 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 sraj et al 2015 in fact it may be important to project the changes of extreme hydrological events with altering climate factors e g precipitation and temperature under climate change therefore a multivariate model that can link climate factors and extreme hydrological events is needed to capture the correlation structure between them and then to better characterize the relationship between climate factors and extreme hydrological events and to project the future trends of extreme events the aim of the study is to project future flood characteristics and assess the impact of precipitation change on floods in lmrb under climate change the remainder of the study is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and climate data including observed ones and simulated ones derived from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate scenarios section 3 is devoted to bias correction method hydrological modelling univariate and bivariate frequency analysis method in section 4 extreme precipitation and floods is projected and the impact of precipitation change on floods is assessed under climate change we perform detailed discussion in section 5 and conclude our conclusions in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river originates from the tibetan plateau and flows through six countries i e china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam before discharging to the south china sea fig 1 a the upper reaches of the lancang mekong river locating in china is called the lancang river and the downstream is known as the mekong river fig 1 a the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is located between 8 to 34 n and 94 e to 110 e fig 1 b with the length of 4 800 km the drainage area of over 795 000 km2 and the annual discharge of 14 500 m3 s elevation ranges from over 5000 m in the tibetan plateau to only a few meters above sea level in the downstream river delta hoang et al 2016 so the basin has rich hydropower resources it is worth mentioning that the study area of this study is the watershed above the pakse hydrological station fig 1 b since we only assess hydrological changes down to pakse station we exclude the downstream area below this station i e south of latitude 15 n the topography conditions in the basin are changeable the distribution characteristics of climate and water resources between the upper and lower reaches are quite different kingston et al 2011 annual average precipitation is relatively high but unevenly distributed in space and time for lancang river basin plateau climate and subtropical monsoon climate are dominant zhong et al 2019 precipitation is mainly concentrated in june to august accounting for more than 60 of the annual precipitation the runoff recharge is dominated by precipitation and snowmelt for mekong river basin the climate type is mainly tropical rainforest climate and tropical monsoon climate precipitation is concentrated in september and october accounting for more than 75 of the annual precipitation the runoff recharge mainly consists of upstream water tributary water and precipitation thompson et al 2013 hoang et al 2016 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate data we prepare climate data for the baseline 1981 2004 and the future period 2021 2050 using various datasets global daily precipitation data from climate prediction center unified gauge based analysis hereinafter referred to as cpc are used as observations cpc precipitation data at a 0 5 resolution are composed of the measured data and the remote sensing satellite data with high accuracy cui et al 2017 sun et al 2018 meteorological data such as temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation are from 28 meteorological stations fig 1 the global climate models gcms selected in this study are derived from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip 2b protocol which provides four gcms from cmip5 and three emission scenarios i e rcp2 6 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in detail the four gcms are geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory s earth system model 2 m gfdl esm2m hereinafter referred to as gfdl hadley global environment model 2 earth system hadgem2 es hereinafter referred to as had institute pierre simon laplace climate model 5a low resolution ipsl cm5a lr hereinafter referred to as ipsl and the model for interdisciplinary research on climate 5 miroc5 hereinafter referred to as mir these climate models are used because they provide detailed daily climate data fine spatial scale and some of them have been proved to perform well in reproducing historical tropical precipitation conditions in lmrb hasson et al 2016 sillmann et al 2013 2 2 2 hydrological data the hydrological data used in this study are from four hydrological stations in lmrb namely the yun jinghong station the luang prabang station the vientiane station and the pakse station shown in fig 1 these data are obtained from mrc s hydrological database mrc 2011 with the time series from 1979 to 2004 3 methods the flowchart of our climate change impact assessments is displayed in fig 2 on which there are four modules the extreme precipitation module screens extreme precipitation index based on the correlation between maximum rainfall with different durations and flood peaks and projects its future trend based on corrected gcms global climate models outputs the hydrological module simulates and projects future streamflow using the swat soli and water assessment tool hydrological model the extreme flood module selects the optimal marginal distribution functions for annual maximum flood peak and volume at four hydrological stations and project the flood characteristics the impact assessment module mainly analyzes the impact of precipitation change on floods via copula function 3 1 bias correction given the systematic errors of gcms their outputs are often not directly applicable as input for hydrological models previous studies have shown that the quantile mapping qm method is more suitable for gcm bias correction block et al 2009 teutschbein and seibert 2012 thus qm method is used to correct daily precipitation simulations from four gcms in this study the theory of qm method is to correct the distribution function of gcm outputs to agree with that of observations which can be done by creating a transfer function with the non parametric conversion method piani et al 2010 3 2 hydrological model swat model is a distributed hydrological model with the detailed physical basis which is suitable for complex large watershed with different soil land use and management conditions arnold et al 1998 when simulating runoff swat model can divide a catchment into a number of sub basins according to the threshold area which defines the minimum drainage area required to form the origin of a stream muleta and nicklow 2005 within the sub basins different hydrological response units hrus can be built with consideration of the combinations of land use soil and management muleta and nicklow 2005 the simulated hydrological process is carried out on the sub basins and hrus and then discharge at the outlet of the basin is simulated based on the principle of water balance in this study we use swat model to simulate daily discharge in lmrb because previous studies e g piman et al 2013 have proved its good simulation performance in this basin we extract the topographic and watershed boundaries of the study area using the dem data of rtmdemutm with a resolution of 90 m http www gscloud cn moreover based on the 1 km spatial resolution of land use data provided by the university of maryland https www osgeo cn map mrc81 and the soil property data provided by the harmonized world soil database http webarchive iiasa ac at research luc external world soil database html we delineate the lmrb into 411 hrus according to the time series length of the hydrological data this study sets 1979 and 1980 as the warm up years 1981 1992 as the calibration period and 1993 2004 as the validation period the hydrological model performance is assessed using two indexes namely the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns between simulations and observations and the relative error re of multi year average discharges furthermore relative error values of flood peak fp and flood volume fv between simulations and observations are used to evaluate the hydrological model performance in simulating the flood events 3 3 distribution function this study applies several common distribution functions to fit precipitation and flood series respectively such as gamma pearson iii gamma for precipitation series p iii for flood series generalized extreme value gev lognormal and loglogistic for p iii distribution probability weighted moments pwm is used to estimate the parameters pwm provided by greenwood et al 1979 has perfect statistical characteristics so it has been widely used in parameter estimation of p iii distribution jing et al 1989 song and ding 1988 as for the other distribution functions maximum likelihood estimation mle is used to estimate parameters in this study hosking and wallis 1988 kolmogorov smirnov k s test is used to evaluate the fitting goodness by comparing the empirical frequency distribution of sample data with a specific theoretical distribution if the difference is smaller than the critical value it is inferred that the sample is subject to the specific distribution as a goodness of fit test algorithm anderson darling a d test is also to see the deviation between empirical distribution and theoretical distribution similarly if the a d value is less than the critical value the samples are considered to conform to the theoretical distribution 3 4 copula function due to the complexity of flood phenomena univariate frequency methods cannot meet the requirements of flood characteristics in the past decades scholars have proposed various multivariate analysis methods for flood characteristics yin et al 2018a 2018b salvadori and de michele 2004 constructing multivariate distributions via copula functions has become a popular method for identifying flood features from a multivariate perspective jeong et al 2014 zhang and singh 2007 this approach has the advantage of capturing independently the dependence structure of the marginal distribution between random variables and incorporating different flood characteristics including duration flood peak and flood volume flood risk can be projected more comprehensively by establishing the joint distribution of multiple flood characteristics wang et al 2020 most previous studies have established multivariate statistical models from the extreme events themselves such as considering the joint distribution of flood duration peak and volume for flood risk assessment genest et al 2007 jeong et al 2014 genest et al 2007 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 sraj et al 2015 under climate change it is particularly important to analyze changes in the probability of occurrence of hydrological extreme events when climate factors e g precipitation temperature change therefore the multivariate model that can link climate elements and extreme hydrological events is needed to establish this study focuses on extreme precipitation and extreme flood to investigate the joint probability of flood occurrence under climate change via the copula function eq 1 there are many types of copula functions among which archimedean copula function is widely used in hydrological multivariate frequency analysis zhang and singh 2006 the copula functions used in this study are three common archimedean copula functions namely gumbel clayton and frank karmakar and simonovic 2009 the parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method akaike information criteria aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse latif and mustafa 2021 are used to evaluate the fitting goodness of copula functions with the smaller the value the better the fitting effect within the copula based framework different definitions of joint return periods have been proposed such as or and kendall dynamic structure based return periods and so on salvadori et al 2013 shi et al 2020 mirabbasi et al 2012 among these the or case is usually adopted in flood occurrence assessment eq 2 yin et al 2020 1 f x y p x x y y c f x x f y y c u v 2 t x x o r y y 1 1 c f x x f y y 1 1 c u v where f x y represents joint distribution function fx x represents the marginal distribution function of variable x fy y is the same fx x but for variable y c u v represents the copula function t x x o r y y represents the joint return period 4 results 4 1 adaptability analysis of gcms to increase the confidence in future projections it is significant to assess the adaptability of gcms this study compares the difference between the simulations of bias corrected gcms and the observations on daily monthly and yearly time scale respectively four statistical indicators i e mean value mean standard deviation sd mann kendall m k and correlation coefficient r were calculated for daily precipitation series and the results are shown in fig 3 a the daily average precipitation derived from bias corrected gcms is greatly consistent with the observed one and sd values are very close with all around 4 an insignificant increase trend simulated by each gcm is also similar to that of observations the r values between the simulated and the observed greatly increase from 0 1 to 0 4 after bias correction for daily precipitation from fig 3 b the four gcms all capture well with observed monthly precipitation the simulated monthly precipitation in rainy season from may to october is slightly higher than the measured monthly precipitation but the opposite is true in dry season from november to april of the following year the spatial distributions of simulated mean annual precipitation from gcms are consistent with the observed one fig 4 from upstream to downstream mean annual precipitation increases from 200 to 2000 mm moreover precipitation in the eastern part is higher than that in the west these results indicate that all bias corrected gcms have good performance in simulating precipitation in the lmrb 4 2 changes in extreme precipitation for 2021 2050 we calculate the annual maximum precipitation over the basin for consecutive n days n 5 10 15 as the extreme precipitation index in this study three correlation coefficients i e pearson kendall and spearman are applied to evaluate the correlation between the extreme precipitation index and the annual maximum flood peak discharges at the pakse station form the table 1 the annual maximum 30 day precipitation am30d achieves the highest correlation with the annual maximum flood peak discharges at the pakse station table 1 therefore this section focuses on the projection of the changes of am30d four probability distribution functions i e gamma gev lognormal and loglogistic are applied to fit the am30d series the results show gev distribution is more suitable than the others table 4 which is consistent with kawagoe et al 2010 and ono et al 2013 therefore gev distribution is applied to project the changes of am30d in future period 2021 2050 compared to historical period 1981 2004 under different return periods in this study table 2 shows the future changes of basin averaged am30d in comparison with historical period under different return periods it can be seen that the changes of am30d have different magnitude even different direction under different climate scenarios under rcp2 6 scenario the ascend trends of am30d are projected by gfdl and mir climate models while had and ipsl climate models project the descend trends for am30d under rcp6 0 scenario all climate model projections show ascend trends except for the descend trend projected by ipsl climate model under rcp8 5 scenario all but gfdl climate models project am30d with ascend trends from all gcms and rcps the basin averaged am30d will more likely increase due to more climate scenarios with the ascend projections take the 100 year return period as an example the changes in am30d between the two periods future and baseline vary spatially in lmrb under different gcms or rcps fig 5 table 3 shows the number of grid with ascend trend of am30d and its share of the total grid points under each climate scenario under rcp2 6 scenario gfdl and mir climate models project an increasing trend of am30d in the lancang river basin and an interval of positive and negative trends in the mekong river basin while had and ipsl climate models project a decreasing trend of am30d in most of the whole basin especially in the mekong river basin under rcp6 0 scenario the percentage of area with an ascend trend of am30d projected by gfdl had and ipsl climate models are 64 4 73 30 and 64 40 respectively mir climate model projections show a descend trend in the lancang river basin and the eastern part of the lower mekong river under rcp8 5 scenario am30d shows an ascend trend across the basin projected by mir climate model from the last column of table 3 the mean area percentage increases with increasing emission scenario in terms of gcms gfdl climate model projections always show the ascend trend in the lancang river basin especially in the lower lancang river basin while the descend trend in the eastern part of the lower mekong river basin had climate model projection directions have no obvious consistence in the spatial distribution under three emission scenarios ipsl climate model projections show the descend trend in the local area of the upper lancang river and the upper mekong basin while the ascend trend in the other area of the whole basin mir climate model projections show the ascend trend in the middle mekong river basin from the last row of the table 3 the mean area percentages of gfdl and mir climate models are relatively larger from all climate scenarios the situation that the area percentage with the higher am30d projections is larger than that with opposite direction projections is more common this suggest drainage area am30d will increase in the future but for the local regions within the basin am30d projections vary greatly between gcms or rcps 4 3 assessment of the swat model the swat simulated and measured daily runoff processes agree well in both the calibration and validation periods with all ns values over 0 7 and most re values within 10 fig 6 the re values at the yun jinghong station are relatively large i e 12 48 and 17 27 for model calibration and validation respectively but still within the satisfactory range of 25 moriasi et al 2007 this is likely due to the underestimated glacier and snow melting in the source water area of the lancang river kiem et al 2005 to further evaluate the flood simulation performance of the swat model in the lmrb we select 10 flood events at each station the re of flood peak fp and flood volume fv between the simulations and the observations are compared respectively we show that the re values are all within 10 at the four stations and the shapes of observed flood processes are generally captured well fig a 1 therefore we can conclude that the swat model is suitable for our modelling analyses 4 4 changes in extreme floods for 2021 2050 this section discusses the changes of frequency and magnitude of the annual maximum peak discharge and maximum 3 day flood volume as the indices of extreme floods at the four hydrological stations under different gcms and rcps the k s test and a d test are used to evaluate the fitting goodness of four probability distribution functions and the results are shown in table 4 all these distribution functions statistical values are lower than the critical values and show good fitting for each station specifically the lognormal distribution is more suitable for the yun jinghong station and pakse station while the gev distribution has better performance for the luang prabang station and the vientiane station the optimal distribution functions are adopted for fitting flood peak and flood volume at four hydrological stations respectively fig 7 table 5 gives the percentage change of flood peak and 3 day flood volume under various return periods the results show a much more varied pattern of the changes in flood frequency across the lmrb than may have been expected from the upstream and downstream of the basin the future flood risk of yun jinghong station on the upper lancang river is uncertain while the future flood risk of the three hydrological stations on the lower mekong river namely luang prabang vientiane and pakse stations is projected to be higher at yun jinghong station half of the climate scenarios project that the annual maximum flood peak and 3 day flood volume show the descend trends while half of the climate scenarios project the opposite directions at the three downstream hydrological stations namely luang prabang vientiane and pakse stations the future flood peak and 3 day flood volumes are projected to increase under all climate scenarios which is consistent with the previous study kiem et al 2008 moreover the larger the return period the larger the increase the greater the impact of climate change from the emission scenario the increase of flood peak and flood volume under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios is greater than that under rcp6 0 scenario from the climate model gfdl climate model projects the largest increase in future flood risk while had climate model has the smallest projections although most climate models project that future basin averaged am30d will show an increasing trend there are still some climate models project basin averaged am30d in the opposite direction table 2 for example am30d projections decrease derived from ipsl climate model under rcp2 6 scenario in the future period 2021 2050 however the future flood peaks projected by the same climate scenario show an increasing trend table 5 this study tries to explain the reasons for this phenomenon ipsl climate model is taken as an example to illustrate fig 8 shows the historical simulations and future projections derived from ipsl under rcp2 6 scenario for 6 flood processes the flood peak of each flood process is the corresponding annual maximum flood peak and the corresponding basin average am30d distribution the temporal distribution of am30d during the historical period is relatively even while am30d is hugely uneven during the future period moreover the extreme value e g am1d and am3d is larger and am30d shows the bimodal distribution during the future period table 6 shows the value standard deviation sd of am30d and flood peak corresponding to the 6 flood processes compared with baseline future am30d value decreases under the some climate scenarios but the standard deviation increases and the flood peak is larger therefore we suggest although the am30d value will decrease under the some climate scenarios but its distribution will be more extreme i e more uneven much higher am1d and am3d and bimodal distribution leading to higher flood risk 4 5 the impact of climate change on floods the climate conditions change rapidly within lmrb räsänen and kummu 2013 the climatic zone of the basin spans between the alpine and tropical zones the upstream of the study area namely lancang river basin is located in the qinghai tibet plateau and the climate system is relatively stable kiem et al 2008 the downstream of the study area namely mekong river basin is located in the prevalent east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon zones with a complex and variable climate system delgado et al 2012 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 the runoff sources in the upstream and downstream are different precipitation and snowmelt are the runoff sources in lancang river while precipitation is the main runoff source in mekong river mekong river has many tributaries and its tributaries hold a large amount of water lauri et al 2012 wang et al 2017 hecht et al 2019 there are 22 tributaries with watershed area greater than 5000 km2 in the whole basin kuenzer et al 2013 extreme precipitation is the main driver of flood hazards in the lower mekong river and is indicative in identifying the causes of flood events therefore it is very important to consider the impact of precipitation change on the floods in the downstream which can provide important value reference for flood control and disaster reduction in the basin copula function is a bridge that links univariate distributions to multivariate distributions and can construct multivariate distribution with different marginal distribution zhang et al 2015 copula function can consider the nonlinear relationship between variables salvadori and de michele 2004 sadegh et al 2018 therefore this section uses copula function to establish the multivariable model that can connect precipitation and flood events so as to capture the connection and related structure between them and then project the future floods according to section 4 2 we know that am30d and flood peak at pakse station have the highest correlation so the joint distribution between the two variable is investigated to estimate the impact of climate change on floods from section 4 2 and section 4 4 it is believed that the optimal marginal probability distributions for precipitation and flood series are gev and lognormal distribution functions respectively then three copula functions are selected to fit the pairs of variables the copula function with the best fitting is determined by the smallest rmse aic and bic as shown in table 7 the three evaluation indices for the frank copula are the smallest so the frank copula is selected to construct the two dimensional joint distribution model to clearly show the impact of climate change on floods we compare the projected flood peaks between univariate distribution and bivariate joint distribution under the same return periods based on the equal frequency between precipitation and flood peak under the joint distribution u fx x v fy y this study projects flood peak discharges under different return periods fig 9 and table a 1 show the projection values and percentage changes of flood peak under different joint return periods respectively comparing table 5 and table a 1 for pakse station the future changes of flood peaks have similar characteristics in univariate and bivariate joint distributions both predict that the intensity and frequency of extreme floods will increase in the future however the univariate frequency analysis projects the lower value for flood peak than that derived from the bivariate frequency analysis considering am30d precipitation under the same return periods and climate scenarios in other words the future flood peak derived from the bivariate frequency analysis is much higher whether it is compared to the results of bivariate frequency analysis in the historical period or the results of univariate frequency analysis in the future period it indicates the change of basin averaged am30d precipitation in the future will lead to the increase of flood peak at pakse station the results derived from the bivariate joint distribution are biased towards safety from the perspective of water conservancy project safety considering the adverse principle flood control design according to the design results derived from the joint distribution of two variables between am30d and flood peak can reduce the risk of flood disaster 5 discussion in terms of the relationship between the annual maximum flood peak discharge and extreme precipitation of various durations amnd we show that the annual maximum 30 day precipitation am30d has the highest correlation with annual maximum flood peak this can be explained by that the shape of basin is long and narrow so precipitation takes about one month to converge to the downstream mrc 2006 delgado et al 2010 thompson et al 2013 most climate scenarios show an increasing trend of future basin average am30d although am30d varies widely in spatial distribution however some climate scenarios predict a decreasing trend of am30d further investigating the distribution characteristics of am30d under these climate scenarios this study finds that the extreme values of am30d e g am1d and am3d in the future are larger than that in historical period this study also finds that the temporal distribution of future am30d is more uneven showing the bimodal distribution this will lead to the higher risk of extreme flooding in the basin univariate frequency analysis shows that the flood risk will increase in the future multivariate frequency analysis considers more factors and gets more reliable results under the background of climate change the joint distribution of precipitation and flood is established via copula function compared with the results of bivariate frequency analysis in the historical period the future flood peak derived from bivariate frequency analysis will increase significantly suggesting extreme flood risk in the basin will increase compared with the results of univariate frequency analysis in the future period the bivariate frequency analysis also projects the much higher flood peak in the future indicating the results of the bivariate joint distribution are biased towards safety xu et al 2021 the design results derived from the bivariate joint distribution should be considered for policy makers and programme managers when making decisions about the design standard for flood prevention and safety of dams to reduce the risk of flood disaster mou et al 2020 we show that future climate change is expected to alter the hydrological regime in the lmrb with good agreement with the previous studies e g eastham et al 2008 mrc 2010 kingston et al 2011 chen et al 2021 due to huge hydropower potential in the lmrb riparian countries have built large numbers of dams in its mainstream and tributaries and are planning to build more dams king et al 2007 mrc 2009 both climate change and hydropower exploitation have influenced the flood regime in the lmrb but the impact on directions of flood peak change is opposite climate change will cause an increase in future flood peak while hydropower will result in reduced future flood peaks and increased dry season runoff lauri et al 2012 have found the influence of hydropower construction on the monthly average runoff at kratie station in lmrb will be greater than that of climate change in 2032 2042 that is the future monthly runoff shows a decreasing trend gcm outputs driving different hydrological models is a popular approach for climate change impact assessment however a variety uncertainty is introduced in such an assessment process including emission scenarios gcm structures downscaling methods and hydrological modelling hydrological model structures and parameters kingston et al 2011 thompson et al 2013 wilby and harris 2006 have found the following order of component significance greatest to least gcm empirical downscaling method hydrological model structure hydrological model parameters emission scenario when projecting low flow in the thames river and the likelihood of a reduction in summer low flows by the 2080 s is 76 for the conditional experiment in which weights are specified for each component of uncertainty on the basis of a very limited set of gcms four gcms however some studies have found that emission scenario uncertainty is significant second only to gcm structures prudhomme and davies 2009 vetter et al 2017 moreover the order of significance of uncertainty sources is related to the study area kay et al 2009 have compared the sources of uncertainty in the impact of climate change on floods in the southeast and northwest basins in england and found that the emission scenario is less significant in the former basin while particularly significant in the latter basin ranking second prudhomme and davies 2009 have suggested that hydrological uncertainty varies significantly between catchments overall there is a clear view that gcm structure uncertainty are the greatest among these uncertainty sources kingston et al 2011 and these uncertainty sources are different only by orders of significance but not by the order of magnitude this is also the case in the lancang mekong river kingston et al 2011 thompson et al 2013 due to the large uncertainty in the precipitation simulated by gcms the data from multiple gcms are usually used to drive hydrological modeling however it is not clear how to make the best choice of gcms with the gradual release of gcms outputs from ipcc ar6 the impact assessment of current and future climate change using a new generation of climate models and emission scenarios is being carried out the simulation data from ipcc ar6 is more abundant however whether or not we can reasonably use these new datasets to increase the confidence in impact assessment is uncertain at this point there are abundant groundwater resources in the basin mrc 2006 for example groundwater in the mekong delta supplies water for domestic use urban water supply irrigation aquaculture and industrial sites about 4 5 million people depend upon groundwater for drinking the relationship between recharge and discharge is often dynamic and seasonal spellman et al 2019 during the wet season floodwaters may have a higher hydraulic head and consequently water will move from the floodwaters into the aquifer system recharge in the dry season when river levels are low water will gradually flow from the aquifer system into the river discharge climate change will cause an increase in annual runoff across the basin which will increase groundwater recharge and reduce the use of groundwater resources however in some areas such as the mekong delta due to the influence of human activities a large amount of groundwater is exploited which greatly increases the recharge of groundwater from surface water buschmann et al 2008 erban et al 2014 the surface runoff is reduced the exploitation rate is far greater than the recharge rate resulting in land subsidence most of the delta lies within 2 m of current sea level and is highly vulnerable to the additive effects of regional pumping induced land subsidence and sea level rise due to climate change erban et al 2014 recent research has documented the effects of direct human activities such as groundwater mining and contamination on groundwater resources in the mekong delta buschmann et al 2008 the effects of climate change whether caused by human activities or natural variability on surface water resources and associated ecosystems have been evaluated in the basin costa cabral et al 2008 hoang et al 2016 ishidaira et al 2008 keskinen et al 2010 tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 however little is known about how subsurface waters in the vadose zone and groundwater might response to climate change and affect the current availability and future sustainability of groundwater resources in the study area green et al 2007 thus there are urgent and ongoing needs to address the expected coupled effects of human activities and climate change on basin wide groundwater resources the lancang mekong river basin is the key region of geopolitical game and economic cooperation in asia kuenzer et al 2013 the change of water resources in the basin is closely related to the life of hundreds of millions of people ziv et al 2012 extreme events are more frequent under climate change in the region the increasing frequency and duration of drought and flood events in the future period will affect the potential of water resources cooperation of the riparian countries under climate change it is necessary to carry out in depth regional water resources management and cooperation of the riparian countries the construction of hundreds of large reservoirs in the basin by china laos vietnam and cambodia has improved the water resources regulation capacity and improved the current spatiotemporal distribution of water resources in the basin hecht et al 2019 however the dramatically increased flood risk in the future will bring new challenges to the management of flood events in the basin the riparian countries must consider the basin as an integrated system with linkages between groundwater and surface hydrology farming systems and environmental health when developing and utilizing water resources ziv et al 2012 arias et al 2012 meanwhile it is of significance for riparian countries to actively promote the joint operation of multi reservoir flood control to deal with the frequent flood disasters in the future kuenzer et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the riparian countries must coordinate cooperate and make sustainable use of water resources to achieve greater resiliency to climate change 6 conclusions based on the four cmip5 gcm outputs this study uses qm method to correct gcm precipitation outputs and projects extreme precipitation variation in the lmrb swat model is set up to simulate daily discharge across the study area several distribution functions are selected to fit flood series at four hydrological stations to predict univariate flood frequency variation moreover the copula function is used to build the joint distribution of precipitation and flood to reflect the impact of climate change on floods the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 these bias corrected gcms have good performance in simulating precipitation in lmrb the basin averaged am30d and flood peak at pakse station have the highest correlation coefficient most climate scenarios show an increasing trend of future basin averaged am30d although am30d varies widely in spatial distribution the extreme values of am30d e g am1d and am3d in the future are larger than that in historical period the temporal distribution of future am30d is more uneven showing the bimodal distribution 2 the swat hydrological model can well reproduce daily discharge and flood process with high ns and low re values at the four hydrological stations 3 for the yun jinghong station large uncertainty is estimated in change of direction of annual maximum flood peak and maximum 3 day flood volume as for the other three stations they are all projected to have larger flood risks in spite of different magnitudes the larger the return period the larger the increase the greater the impact of climate change the increase of flood peak and flood volume under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios is greater than that under rcp6 0 scenario gfdl climate model projects the largest increase in future flood risk while had climate model has the smallest projections 4 the future flood peak derived from the bivariate frequency analysis is much higher whether it is compared to the results of bivariate frequency analysis in the historical period or the results of univariate frequency analysis in the future period this suggests the change of basin averaged am30d precipitation in the future will lead to the increase of flood peak at pakse station from the perspective of water conservancy project safety considering the adverse principle flood control design according to the design results derived from the joint distribution of two variables between am30d and flood peak can reduce the risk of flood disaster credit authorship contribution statement shuxia wang conceptualization methodology formal analysis software writing original draft
