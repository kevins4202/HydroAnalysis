755,improved methods for predicting fluid transport and vesicle connectivity in heterogeneous basalts are critical for determining the long term reaction and trapping behavior of sequestered carbon dioxide and maximizing the efficiency of geothermal energy production in this study we measured vesicle geometry pore connectivity and vesicle surface area of three basalt cores from the carbfix carbon storage project in iceland using a combination of micro computed tomography clinical computed tomography and micro positron emission tomography a vesicle percolation simulator was then constructed to quantify vesicle connectivity across a complete range of porosities pore size distributions and microporosity conditions percolation simulations that incorporate important geologic features such as microporosity are able to describe the trend of experimental measurements made in this study and in previous work without relying on statistical or empirical techniques simulation results highlight and quantify the trade off between storage capacity and reactive surface area in high porosity basalts experiment and simulation results also indicate that there is very limited connected pore space below total porosity values of 15 guiding improved site selection for large scale co2 storage projects use of this stochastic percolation simulation method for basalt storage reservoir evaluation will enable more accurate storage capacity and mineral trapping estimates keywords carbon capture and storage geothermal energy positron emission tomography effective porosity micro ct percolation simulation 1 introduction wide scale implementation of carbon capture and storage ccs and geothermal energy production has the potential to significantly reduce anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions relative to current fossil fuel based power generation facilities and production operations benson and cook 2005 socolow and pacala 2004 szulczewski et al 2012 due to the global scale and geographic extent of co2 emissions a number of different types of carbon storage reservoirs are needed storage reservoirs include deep saline aquifers michael et al 2010 abandoned oil and gas fields benson and cook 2005 and basalt or ultramafic rock reservoirs gislason and oelkers 2014 goldberg et al 2010 while saline aquifers and abandoned oil and gas fields have been studied and characterized extensively for co2 carbon storage much remains to be learned about the storage potential injection viability and large scale co2 trapping potential in basalt reservoirs basalt formations are enticing reservoirs for long term co2 storage due to their potential to immobilize large volumes of co2 through mineral trapping gislason and oelkers 2014 and their geographic extent in areas lacking saline aquifers or abandoned oil and gas reservoirs basalts are particularly favorable to mineral storage of co2 due to the presence of highly reactive silicate minerals and glasses rich in divalent cations that are necessary to promote formation of stable carbonate minerals basaltic provinces with potential for storing large volumes of co2 include the columbia river flood basalts in the pacific northwest us mcgrail et al 2006 2017 tollefson 2013 the central atlantic magmatic province basalts on the east coast of the us goldberg et al 2010 basaltic oceanic crust and volcanic islands such as the hawaiian islands and iceland aradóttir et al 2012 goldberg et al 2008 matter et al 2016 rezvani khalilabad et al 2008 snæbjörnsdóttir and gislason 2016 snæbjörnsdóttir et al 2018

and fluid transport and co2 trapping in ccs storage reservoirs requires measurements of basalt reactivity vesicle matrix surface area pore space geometry and porosity aradóttir et al 2012 callow et al 2018 snæbjörnsdóttir et al 2018 wolff boenisch and galeczka 2018 a wide range of methods exist to characterize the total porosity effective porosity permeability and estimate surface area of basaltic samples these methods include point counting franzson et al 2008 manning and bird 1991 saar and manga 1999 sigurosson et al 2000 helium porosimetry gas expansion techniques ellis and wright 2006 farquharson et al 2015 heap et al 2014 kushnir et al 2016 lamur et al 2017 mueller et al 2005 saar 1998 sigurosson et al 2000 and the brunauer emmet taylor bet surface area measurement method beckingham et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 kushnir et al 2016 landrot et al 2012 navarre sitchler et al 2013 respectively with the advancements in imaging methods total porosity pore geometry and surface area can also be measured with micro x ray computed tomography micro ct bai et al 2010 beckingham et al 2017 callow et al 2018 luhmann et al 2017 navarre sitchler et al 2009 polacci et al 2008 2012

advancements measurements of effective porosity also referred to as connected porosity and effective surface area are typically performed on very small samples 1 cm3 at ambient conditions and without the benefit of directly observing fluid transport in the sample clinical positron emission tomography pet and more recently small bore preclinical micro pet has been used to image flow pathways and quantify solute advection and diffusion at the continuum scale under elevated pressure and temperature conditions boutchko et al 2012 brattekas et al 2016 fernø et al 2015 goethals et al 2009 hu et al 2017 kulenkampff et al 2015 lippmann pipke et al 2017 pini et al 2016 zahasky and benson 2018 when combined with other imaging modalities such as micro ct and clinical ct micro pet imaging is capable of characterizing complex fluid transport behavior and sample properties of geologic materials the complexity and laborious nature of many experimental measurements of total porosity effective porosity total surface area and effective surface area limit the number of samples that may be characterized experimental limitations make it challenging to understand basalt vesicle connectivity and surface area trends that can vary due to emplacement thermodynamic conditions interactions with water and degassing activity along with potential hydrothermal alteration metamorphism stress history and weathering mcgrail et al 2006 song et al 2001 the development of numerical models that can incorporate experimental measurements of these geologic characteristics and predict vesicle connectivity and surface area are essential for reactive transport simulation modeling predicting geothermal reservoir heat transfer efficiency and robustly quantifying basalt reservoir co2 storage capacity in this study pore connectivity advective pathways and surface area were characterized in vesicular basalt cores to better understand co2 storage and trapping properties relevant in ccs projects three cores were obtained from the carbfix co2 storage pilot project two low porosity 10 cores and one higher porosity 30 core using a combination of micro ct clinical ct and micro pet imaging during tracer injection coreflooding experiments it was possible to measure effective and total porosity and effective and total vesicle surface area sample analysis and imaging results also highlight the importance of rims of microcracks and microporous features on vesicle connectivity motivated by these observations a vesicle percolation simulator was constructed in order to generalize vesicle connectivity across a complete range of porosities pore size distributions and microporosity conditions vesicular basalts are the focus of this study as they have been proposed as the principle basalt feature associated with high co2 injectivity and storage volume mcgrail et al 2006 experimental characterization from this study and other reports in literature are compared with the simulation results the findings of this study highlight the trade off between pore volume and surface area in high porosity basalts and provide a method for better predicting effective porosity based on experimental observations of vesicle properties 2 materials and methods the focus of the carbfix project managed by the geothermal power company reykjavík energy is to validate the feasibility of injecting co2 dissolved in water into subsurface mafic reservoirs for long term storage from january to march 2012 and june to august 2012 175 tons of co2 gas and 73 tons of a co2 h2s gas mixture from the hellisheidi geothermal power plant were dissolved in water and injected into a subsurface basaltic formation matter et al 2016 cores used in this study kb2017a kb2017b kb2017c were obtained from well kb01 drilled in 2014 between the injection well hn 02 and the monitoring well hn 04 all of the cores were 4 5 cm in diameter and between 3 5 and 10 1 cm in length a complete summary of sample dimensions and well depth locations is included in the table 1 an important characteristic of sample kb2017b was that it contained a natural axial fracture that ran the entire length of the core samples kb2017a and kb2017c did not contain visible fractures the porosity analysis of the each of the samples was performed on multiple small plugs cored adjacent to each of the samples effective porosity measurements were performed with a micromeritics accupyc ii helium pycnometer with a 3 5 cm3 volume chamber the mean helium porosity measurement for each sample is included in table 2 with measurement details in the excel sheet provided in the supplementary material the mineralogy and composition of the carbfix cores have been analyzed in previous studies by a number of methods including optical petrography and electron microscopy alfredsson et al 2013 snæbjörnsdóttir et al 2018 thomas 2018 an important observation from the optical petrography and backscatter electron images of the samples presented in detail in thomas 2018 is the rim of microcracks and other microporous features surrounding many of the vesicles as highlighted in fig 1 these features are below the resolution of micro ct imaging similar microcracks and microporous features have been observed in other experimental studies of vesicular basalts lamur et al 2017 luhmann et al 2017 mueller et al 2005 navarre sitchler et al 2009 2013 2 1 coreflooding experiments to measure the total and effective porosity and total and connected surface area in the three carbfix cores a multiscale and multimodal characterization process was employed prior to coreflooding the cores were scanned using a zeiss 3d x ray microscope to obtain micro ct images of the pore structure the operating conditions for the micro ct were 140 kv and 10 w using a 0 4x objective with a two second exposure time the reconstructed micro ct images of all of the samples had voxel side lengths of approximately 50 µm exact dimensions of each scan can be found in the excel sheet in the supplementary material following initial characterization and micro ct imaging coreflooding experiments were performed to measure permeability and image pore space connectivity with micro pet to enable injection quantification and disposal of radioactive tracers for micro pet imaging a standard core flooding apparatus perrin and benson 2010 was adapted as described in detail in zahasky and benson 2018 a pet scan was not performed on core kb2017c because it had a permeability less than 1 μd and therefore steady state injection conditions could not be reached the process for loading the cores into the custom aluminum coreholder was to first wrap the core with teflon tape then two layers of heat shrinkable wrap and finally a viton sleeve the teflon tape wrap is essential to prevent fluid bypass in low permeability cores as any fluid bypass is obvious in the pet images the cores were then loaded into an aluminum core holder and water was injected into the volume between the outside of the viton sleeve and the internal wall of the core holder to provide confining pressure on the rock confining pressure was chosen to provide and maintain an effective pressure i e confining overburden pressure minus pore pressure of 2 3 1 mpa at all times the cores were saturated with milliq water by injecting at constant flow rate for a minimum of twelve hours fully saturating the samples with water is important for preventing multiphase flow during radiotracer injection and micro pet imaging once the cores were loaded in the coreholder and saturated with water each core was scanned using a clinical general electric hi speed ct scanner the scanner voltage and current settings were 120 kv and 200 ma respectively the reconstructed images had a voxel size of 0 3125 mm x 0 3125 mm x 1 25 mm the clinical ct scan was used to assist with the registration of the micro ct images with the micro pet images because the clinical ct has high enough resolution to uniquely identify large individual vesicles from the micro ct scan and the clinical ct can image the exact orientation of the core in coreholder for registration with the micro pet scan for the micro pet scans on samples kb2017a and kb2017b the fludeoxyglucose 18f fdg radiotracer was diluted into an isco pump initially containing milliq water fludeoxyglucose is a widely available conservative tracer as confirmed by radioactivity mass balance from tracer curve analysis and has a half life of 109 7 minutes these characteristics make fdg an ideal choice for multi hour tracer injection studies once mixed the solution in the tracer pump was injected through the core kb2017a 0 014 ml min kb2017b 0 2 ml min a minimum of one pore volume of fluid was injected into each sample in order to highlight the connected pores due to the difference in pore volume only 5 ml of radiotracer was injected in sample kb2017a while 30 ml of tracer was injected into kb2017b the micro pet scans were performed using a siemens pre clinical inveon dpet scanner at the stanford center for innovation in in vivo imaging the pet scans were reconstructed with 3d ordered subset expectation maximization using maximum a priori osem opmap hudson and larkin 1994 reconstructed images had square voxels with a side length of 0 8 mm for all scans 2 2 imaging analysis following image acquisition and reconstruction the micro ct and micro pet scans were manually registered with the clinical ct scans using avizo scientific 2018 the micro ct was segmented in avizo to determine the location and geometry of the vesicles and matrix while countless methods exist for porosity segmentation iassonov et al 2009 we chose to segment the micro ct images with the watershed method due to its relative ease and robustness vincent and soille 1991 examples of this segmentation for kb2017a and kb2017b are illustrated in fig 2 along with the calculated vesicle size distributions for all three samples all of the samples show a log normal distribution of pore radii as has commonly been observed in previous studies callow et al 2018 mcgrail et al 2006 shin et al 2005 song et al 2001 it is important to note that the presence of any fractures in kb2017a and some regions of the axial fracture in kb2017b are below the resolution of the micro ct and clinical ct scans once registered micro pet data and segmented micro ct data were exported to matlab the pore space identified from the micro ct images was used to calculate the total porosity and total surface area the effective porosity and effective surface area was determined by identifying the vesicles from the micro ct scan that overlapped with the location of radiotracer from the registered pet data for example see left images in fig 2 matrix material identified in the segmented micro ct scans may contain radiotracer due to 1 micro pet spatial resolution limitations 2 radiotracer present in features below the micro ct resolution i e features connecting vesicles in kb2017a or 3 slight offsets in the micro ct and micro pet plane of view as a result of different voxel sizes due to the minimal amount of radioactivity injected for the pet scans if any part of a vesicle as defined from the registered micro ct scan contained radiotracer the entire vesicle and all additional overlapping vesicles was considered connected and therefore included in the effective porosity calculations the numerical methods for calculating the porosity and surface area were the same as those used in the following section to calculate porosity and surface area in the simulation models using the same algorithms for pore structure characterization in both the imaging and numerical models provided consistency between the simulation and experimental analysis 2 3 stochastic percolation simulation to generalize the experimental observations of connectivity porosity and surface area across a range of basalt porosity microporosity in the form of microcracked vesicle rims and vesicle size distribution conditions a percolation simulator was developed to generate stochastic models of vesicle distribution percolation theory is a statistical method for describing systems that exhibit approximately random behavior bai et al 2010 blower 2001 ellis and wright 2006 sahimi 1994 walsh and saar 2008 by calculating the connectivity porosity and surface area of the vesicles in each percolation model it is possible to correlate effective porosity and surface area with total porosity the percolation simulator was written in matlab and propagates one 3d spherical vesicle during each iteration n and randomly places the vesicle in a synthetic 3d model fig 3 illustrates the center slice of an example simulation at different iterations during each iteration the radius of the propagated vesicle is determined by selecting a random value from a radii distribution array that is constructed based on a probability distribution function such as those observed experimentally right plot in fig 2 to reduce computation memory requirements the vesicle locations are recorded in an m 4 array the columns of this array contain the x y and z grid cell coordinates and vesicle identification number m is the total number of grid cells in which there is pore space in the synthetic 3d basalt model if a new vesicle is propagated on a grid cell where a vesicle is already present then the vesicles are determined to be connected and are assigned the same vesicle identification number the vesicle identification number is used to efficiently determine the extent of connectivity between vesicles in the 3d model after some incremental change in porosity usually 0 1 the following model properties are calculated total porosity ϕt defined as the total number of grid cells containing the vesicles m divided by the total number of grid cells in the model g 1 ϕ t m g effective porosity ϕe defined as the number of grid cells continuously connected to left side of model mc divided by the total number of grid cells in the model in a physical model this would be the porosity accessible by fractures spaced at 2x the synthetic model width the evolution of effective porosity versus total porosity in 50 simulations is indicated by the red lines in the top of fig 4 2 ϕ e m c g percolation threshold porosity defined as the porosity at which a volume of vesicles is continuously connected to the left and right side of the model above the percolation threshold porosity there is a path that fluid can follow through interconnected vesicles from the left side to the right side of model this is often termed the percolation threshold in percolation theory literature sahimi 1994 in a system with no fractures this would be the threshold above which it is possible to maintain large scale injection through advective fluid transport the percolation threshold porosity in 50 simulations is illustrated by the vertical black lines in the top of fig 4 total volume normalized surface area s t of all of the vesicles in the model blue lines on the bottom plot in fig 4 total volume normalized surface area is calculated by counting the number of grid cell faces that lie at the interface between all vesicles and matrix ft divided by the total number of grid cells in the model shin et al 2005 3 s t f t g volume normalized effective surface area s e of all vesicles contributing to effective porosity red lines in the bottom plot in fig 4 effective volume normalized surface area is calculated by counting the number of grid cell faces that lie at the interface between effective porosity vesicles and the matrix fe divided by the total number of grid cells in the model 4 s e f e g a simulation terminates when a specified total porosity threshold is reached e g 60 the assumptions of this percolation simulator are that there is no flow through matrix individual vesicles are spherical although clusters of individual spheres form non ideal shapes the vesicle geographical distribution is random e g no interaction from mineral crystallization and vesicle surfaces are planar due to cubic structure of the simulation grid it has been suggested that specific surface area calculations by direct counting of voxel faces may overestimate surface area due to the staircasing effect song et al 2001 however surface area calculations could also be underestimated by ignoring any vesicle surface roughness behavior that has been observed in basalt samples luhmann et al 2017 navarre sitchler et al 2013 detailed vesicle surface characterization such as the bse images in fig 1 can be used to determine whether surface smoothing or incorporation of a surface roughness factor is necessary for a given geologic sample beckingham et al 2016 wells et al 2017 all models described in this and the following section have a side length of 120 grid cells g 120 3 and a normal vesicle radius distribution with a mean radius of five grid cells sensitivity analysis described in appendix a indicates that the median trend of the percolation simulations does not vary with system size i e total number of grid cells or vesicle radii distribution indicating that detailed knowledge of vesicle topology and size distributions may not be necessary to estimate vesicle connectivity this agrees with percolation theory predictions that as system size approaches infinity a single percolation threshold value is reached sahimi 1994 physical length scales are purposely neglected in the models to highlight scale independence of the median connectivity behavior the median percolation threshold in the top of fig 4 bold black vertical line is approximately 0 32 a value nearly equal to the percolation threshold of 0 3116 predicted for a 3d simple cubic sphere system sahimi 1994 these comparisons with analytical predictions serve to validate the accuracy of the numerical model the results in the lower plot in fig 4 highlight that the effective surface area is significantly lower that the total surface area and that the relationship between surface area and total porosity is nonmonotonic as porosity of the model increases above the percolation threshold both the total and effective surface area begin to decrease due to higher vesicle overlap and connectivity this behavior is not captured in analytical expressions of surface area as a function of porosity mcgrail et al 2006 and highlights an important benefit of percolation simulation analysis 2 4 simulations accounting for microporosity petrographic thin section analysis and backscatter electron imaging from the experimental work fig 1 and observations in previous studies highlight the importance of accounting for rims of microcracks and microporosity around the vesicles in order to properly generalize vesicle connectivity to account for microporous material in the percolation simulations a rim of microporous material was added to the outside of the vesicles percolated in the synthetic model in the simulations if the microporous region overlapped between different vesicles then they were considered connected for the effective porosity calculations see fig 5 for illustration for the simulations in this study the microporous region was assumed to have no impact on total porosity or surface area however this feature could easily be assigned a secondary porosity value similar to dual porosity features commonly incorporated into transport simulation models gerke and van genuchten 1993 variation in microporous rim width was examined by running 50 simulations with each model having 1 and 2 grid cell widths of microporosity around every vesicle the effective versus total porosity results of these simulations can be seen in the fig 6 the median trend of simulations with 1 and 2 grid cell widths of microporosity are shown in fig 7 the role of larger thoroughgoing fractures on vesicle connectivity and system conductivity are beyond the scope of this study 3 results 3 1 experimental results the experimental measurements of effective porosity versus total porosity are summarized in fig 7 along with data from several studies utilizing alternative imaging methods such as neutron scattering navarre sitchler et al 2013 micro ct callow et al 2018 and synchrotron micro ct song et al 2001 for characterizing effective and total porosity of different basalts specifically the samples analyzed in navarre sitchler et al 2013 were composed of basalt porphery with plagioclase phenocrysts and the samples in song et al 2001 were vesiculated calcite filled vesiculated and scoria tephra basalts analysis in callow et al 2018 was also performed on carbfix basalt samples that had olivine tholeitte composition a summary of sample porosity and surface area measurements from the imaging registration segmentation and analysis is provided in table 2 in sample kb2017a the pet tracer experiment revealed a discrete highly localized region of flow after 6 hours of radiotracer injection as illustrated by a center slice of the segmented micro ct and micro pet in fig 2 this likely results from sub resolution microcracks and highlights the fact that most of the vesicles within the sample were disconnected this highly localized flow behavior leads to an effective porosity 2 8 that is significantly lower than the total porosity 7 6 sample kb2017c was found to have a porosity of 6 4 and the effective porosity was determined to be zero due to the very low permeability 1μd which prevented fluid transmission with the coreflooding system this is consistent with other experimental and imaging work that indicates limited connectivity and very low permeability of unfractured samples with porosity values less than 10 bai et al 2010 mueller et al 2005 as expected from the extent radiotracer distribution in fig 2 most of the vesicles in sample kb2017b were interconnected total porosity 27 1 effective porosity 26 7 near the inlet of the core nearly all of the pores were filled with radiotracer however as some of the interconnected vesicle pathways terminated there were several regions near the outlet of the core that had minimal or no radiotracer after more than one pore volume of radiotracer injection experimental measurements from this study agree well with the observations from previous studies by callow et al 2018 navarre sitchler et al 2013 song et al 2001 which found very little connected porosity in samples with less than 15 porosity between 10 and 25 porosity there is a wide range of trends between effective and total porosity and above 25 porosity effective porosity and total porosity are nearly equal several studies have observed this general relationship between effective porosity and total porosity and described this relationship with empirical percolation blower 2001 navarre sitchler et al 2009 analytical mcgrail et al 2006 or linear saar and manga 1999 functions 3 2 stochastic percolation simulation results the simulation results summarized in fig 6 and 7 demonstrate that as the thickness of the microporous rim increases the vesicles become more interconnected and therefore the effective porosity at a given total porosity increases with the addition of microporosity the simulation results are consistent with the experiments conducted here and with previously reported data fig 7 4 discussion the stochastic percolation simulation model results agree well with experimental data from this and previous studies by callow et al 2018 navarre sitchler et al 2013 song et al 2001 when microfractured vesicle rims and microporosity are taken into account the porosity of the modeled vesicular basalts increases as percolated vesicle density and total vesicle volume increases at low porosity values there is very limited connectivity in the system making fluid transmission difficult between a total porosity of 10 25 vesicle connectivity increase rapidly and as basalt porosity increases above 25 porosity most of the vesicles become interconnected above a total porosity of around 30 surface area also is shown to begin to decrease these trends in connectivity agree well with previous experimental and modeling studies analyzing permeability as a function of basalt porosity costa 2006 farquharson et al 2015 kushnir et al 2016 mueller et al 2005 use of the percolation simulation models to specifically estimate permeability as function of total porosity is an area for future work using a combination of micro ct clinical ct and micro pet it is possible to measure total porosity total surface area effective porosity and effective surface area the advantage of this method over previous experimental methods is that measurements directly observe fluid flow in the core at elevated pressures and temperatures as a basis for calculating effective porosity and surface area direct imaging of pore size and geometry provides more accurate vesicle size distributions than using the cylindrical pore model or other simplified models to infer pore sized distribution from mercury injection capillary pressure analysis in addition larger intact samples are analyzed thus reducing edge effects which tend to overestimate effective porosity for small samples previous studies utilizing the method of gas expansion pycnometry for determining connectivity in basalts found very little difference between effective porosity and total porosity except at very low 10 total porosity values saar and manga 1999 sigurosson et al 2000 while the experimental imaging data from this study and those by song et al 2001 and navarre sitchler et al 2009 as well as nonimaging based measurements described in colombier et al 2017 support the observation of very limited effective porosity below a total porosity of 10 experimental imaging measurements indicate that in some systems effective porosity may not approach total porosity until values approach or exceed 25 differences in effective porosity measurements between studies are likely the result of variability in basalt formation and weathering sample preparation potential edge effects in small samples norton and knapp 1977 and fluids e g helium versus water used to measure porosity washburn and bunting 1922 experimental data of effective porosity versus total porosity indicate several trends that vary as function of total porosity the scattering of data around these trends arise from complex variations associated with basalt formation weathering secondary mineral formation and mechanical deformation these features may result from vesicle shape variation nonrandom vesicle distribution and variability in sample microporosity and fracture extent percolation simulations illustrate the ability to approximate these complex trends observed in the experimental data and capture many of the important features that determine vesicle connectivity in heterogeneous basalts using only sample porosity approximate extent of microporosity and assuming random vesicle spatial distributions some types of basalt such as vesicular scoria or other nonrandom vesicle distributions may require percolation simulations to incorporate vesicle spatial correlations or multipoint statistics these models advance our ability to approximate and predict the connection between total porosity and effective porosity because it does not rely on regression or empirical techniques but incorporates geologically determined rock geometry vesicle size and distribution and microporosity to understand fluid connectivity in vesicular basalt systems 5 conclusions and implications the relationship between effective porosity and total porosity has important implications for estimating injectivity and storage capacity of carbon dioxide in basalt formations both experimental and simulation results from this study indicate that target formations within basalt reservoirs should ideally have total porosities of 25 and a minimum total porosity of 15 depending on fracturing and microporous behavior for vesicle connectivity high enough for sustainable injectivity as with large scale co2 storage reservoirs in sedimentary rocks the target basalt formation will also need a low permeability seal to retain injected co2 until mineral trapping occurs several previously published estimates of basalt storage capacity assume complete connectivity in basalts with total porosity values less than 15 goldberg et al 2008 mcgrail et al 2006 without detailed knowledge of extent and variation in vesicle interconnectivity at low porosity values there is serious potential for overestimating the storage volume in basalt reservoirs overestimation of formation capacity and injectivity significantly increases the risk of issues such as induced seismicity snæbjörnsdóttir and gislason 2016 results from simulations also indicate an important trend in surface area of basalts with increasing porosity as porosity of the material continues to increase above the percolation threshold both the total and effective surface area begin to decrease due to higher vesicle overlap and connectivity the trade off is that ideal carbon storage reservoirs should have maximum porosity and therefore maximum storage volume however at high porosities there will be less material and mineral surfaces available for geochemical reactions and carbonate mineral formation per volume of rock this observation is also important in the context of geothermal energy higher porosity geothermal reservoirs contain larger volumes of water and steam while higher rock fluid surface area increases geothermal heat transfer site specific studies will be necessary to optimize reservoir performance based on porosity microporosity and fracture extent in a given basalt formation the methods described in this work will enable better prediction of connectivity and transport in basaltic systems using standard porosity and thin section analysis to determine the percolation model input parameters of porosity and microporous rim dimensions there is potential for future work to incorporate these percolation models into reactive transport simulations evaluate the role of fracture density and orientation on system connectivity and use percolation simulation techniques to better predict permeability and injectivity in basalt reservoirs acknowledgments this work is funded by the global climate energy project the stanford center for carbon storage the france stanford

authors wish to thank five anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and feedback appendix a percolation simulation sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to analyze the effect of total 3d system volume and vesicle size distribution in order to test the influence of 3d system size 50 simulations with normal vesicle distributions were performed at five different system sizes 40 60 80 100 and 120 voxels i e grid cells per side length this is equal to 8 12 16 20 and 24 times the mean vesicle radius respectively results from this analysis indicate that while the variability between simulation results decreases with increasing system size the median behavior of 50 simulations in nearly identical as illustrated by the surface area calculations in fig 8 due to the low computational cost of the simulations and to prevent large outlier models all of the simulations in this study were run at 120 grid cells per side length a number of different vesicle size distributions have been observed in literature sahagian et al 1989 recorded normal lognormal bimodal and trimodal vesicle size distributions while mostly lognormal distributions were observed by mcgrail et al 2006 shin et al 2005 song et al 2001 sato et al 1997 observed unevenly random distribution of pore sizes in basalt based on these observations in literature and the lognormal vesicle radius distributions measured in the experiments four sets of simulation models were run with random normal lognormal and bimodal vesicle radius distributions see fig 9 for example distributions results of this vesicle distribution sensitivity analysis indicate that while there is variability from one simulation to another the median trend of 50 simulations produces nearly identical effective porosity percolation threshold and effective volume normalized surface area fig 10 results also indicate that vesicle radii distribution does not have a strong influence on the median percolation threshold which agrees well with observations by walsh and saar 2008 there is a slight variation in total volume normalized surface area because vesicle distributions with large numbers of small vesicles such as the lognormal distribution are expected to have a slightly higher surface area to volume ratio and thus a higher total surface area at a given total porosity level supplementary

carbon dioxide emissions relative to current fossil fuel based power generation facilities and production operations benson and cook 2005 socolow and pacala 2004 szulczewski et al 2012 due to the global scale and geographic extent of co2 emissions a number of different types of carbon storage reservoirs are needed storage reservoirs include deep saline aquifers michael et al 2010 abandoned oil and gas fields benson and cook 2005 and basalt or ultramafic rock reservoirs gislason and oelkers 2014 goldberg et al 2010 while saline aquifers and abandoned oil and gas fields have been studied and characterized extensively for co2 carbon storage much remains to be learned about the storage potential injection viability and large scale co2 trapping potential in basalt reservoirs basalt formations are enticing reservoirs for long term co2 storage due to their potential to immobilize large volumes of co2 through mineral trapping gislason and oelkers 2014 and their geographic extent in areas lacking saline aquifers or abandoned oil and gas reservoirs basalts are particularly favorable to mineral storage of co2 due to the presence of highly reactive silicate minerals and glasses rich in divalent cations that are necessary to promote formation of stable carbonate minerals basaltic provinces with potential for storing large volumes of co2 include the columbia river flood basalts in the pacific northwest us mcgrail et al 2006 2017 tollefson 2013 the central atlantic magmatic province basalts on the east coast of the us goldberg et al 2010 basaltic oceanic crust and volcanic

beckingham et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 kushnir et al 2016 landrot et al 2012 navarre sitchler et al 2013 respectively with the advancements in imaging methods total porosity pore geometry and surface

advancements measurements of effective porosity also referred to as connected porosity and effective surface area are typically performed on very small samples 1 cm3 at ambient conditions and without the benefit of directly observing fluid transport in the sample clinical positron emission tomography pet and more recently small bore preclinical micro pet has been used to image flow pathways and

2017 kulenkampff et al 2015 lippmann pipke et al 2017 pini et al 2016 zahasky and benson 2018 when combined with other imaging modalities such as micro ct and clinical ct micro pet imaging is capable of characterizing complex fluid transport behavior and sample properties of geologic materials the complexity and laborious nature of many experimental measurements of total porosity effective porosity total surface area and effective surface area limit the number of samples that may be characterized experimental limitations make it challenging to understand basalt vesicle connectivity and surface area trends that can vary due to emplacement thermodynamic conditions interactions with water and degassing activity along with potential hydrothermal alteration metamorphism stress history and weathering mcgrail et al 2006 song et al 2001 the development of numerical models that can incorporate experimental measurements of these geologic characteristics and predict vesicle connectivity and surface area are essential for reactive transport simulation modeling predicting geothermal reservoir heat transfer efficiency and robustly quantifying basalt reservoir co2 storage capacity in this study pore connectivity advective pathways and surface area were characterized in vesicular basalt cores to better understand co2 storage and trapping properties relevant in ccs projects three cores were obtained from the carbfix co2 storage pilot project two low porosity 10 cores and one higher porosity 30 core using a combination of micro ct clinical ct and micro pet imaging during tracer injection coreflooding experiments it was possible to measure effective and total porosity and effective and total vesicle surface area sample analysis and imaging results also highlight the importance of rims of microcracks and microporous features on vesicle connectivity motivated by these observations a vesicle percolation simulator was constructed in order to generalize vesicle connectivity across a complete range of porosities pore size distributions and microporosity conditions vesicular basalts are the focus of this study as they have been proposed as the principle basalt feature associated with high co2 injectivity and storage volume mcgrail et al 2006 experimental characterization from this study and other reports in literature are compared with the simulation results the findings of this study highlight the trade off between pore volume and surface area in high porosity basalts and provide a method for better predicting effective porosity based on experimental observations of vesicle properties 2 materials and methods the focus of the carbfix project managed by the geothermal power company reykjavík energy is to validate the feasibility of injecting co2 dissolved in water into subsurface mafic reservoirs for long term storage from january to march 2012 and june to august 2012 175 tons of co2 gas and 73 tons of a co2 h2s gas mixture from the hellisheidi geothermal power plant were dissolved in water and injected into a subsurface basaltic formation matter et al 2016 cores used in this study kb2017a kb2017b kb2017c were obtained from well kb01 drilled in 2014 between the injection well hn 02 and the monitoring well hn 04 all of the cores were 4 5 cm in diameter and between 3 5 and 10 1 cm in length a complete summary of sample dimensions and well depth locations is included in the table 1 an important characteristic of sample kb2017b was that it contained a natural axial fracture that ran the entire length of the core samples kb2017a and kb2017c did not contain visible fractures the porosity analysis of the each of the samples was performed on multiple small plugs cored adjacent to each of the samples effective porosity measurements were performed with a micromeritics accupyc ii helium pycnometer with a 3 5 cm3 volume chamber the mean helium porosity measurement for each sample is included in table 2 with measurement details in the excel sheet provided in the supplementary material the mineralogy and composition of the carbfix cores have been analyzed in previous studies by a number of methods including optical petrography and electron microscopy alfredsson et al 2013 snæbjörnsdóttir et al 2018 thomas 2018 an important observation from the optical petrography and backscatter electron images of the samples presented in detail in thomas 2018 is the rim of microcracks and other microporous features surrounding many of the vesicles as highlighted in fig 1 these features are below the resolution of micro ct imaging similar microcracks and microporous features have been observed in other experimental studies of vesicular basalts lamur et al 2017 luhmann et al 2017 mueller et al 2005 navarre sitchler et al 2009 2013 2 1 coreflooding experiments to measure the total and effective porosity and total and connected surface area in the three carbfix cores a multiscale and multimodal characterization process was employed prior to coreflooding the cores were scanned using a zeiss 3d x ray microscope to obtain micro ct images of the pore structure the operating conditions for the micro ct were 140 kv and 10 w using a 0 4x objective with a two second exposure time the reconstructed micro ct images of all of the samples had voxel side lengths of approximately 50 µm exact dimensions of each scan can be found in the excel sheet in the supplementary material following initial characterization and micro ct imaging coreflooding experiments were performed to measure permeability and image pore space connectivity with micro pet to enable injection quantification and disposal of radioactive tracers for micro pet imaging a standard core flooding apparatus perrin and benson 2010 was adapted as described in detail in zahasky and benson 2018 a pet scan was not performed on core kb2017c because it had a permeability less than 1 μd and therefore steady state injection conditions could not be reached the process for loading the cores into the custom aluminum coreholder was to first wrap the core with teflon tape then two layers of heat shrinkable wrap and finally a viton sleeve the teflon tape wrap is essential to prevent fluid bypass in low permeability cores as any fluid bypass is obvious in the pet images the cores were then loaded into an aluminum core holder and water was injected into the volume between the outside of the viton sleeve and the internal wall of the core holder to provide confining pressure on the rock confining pressure was chosen to provide and maintain an effective pressure i e confining overburden pressure minus pore pressure of 2 3 1 mpa at all times the cores were saturated with milliq water by injecting at constant flow rate for a minimum of twelve hours fully saturating the samples with water is important for preventing multiphase flow during radiotracer injection and micro pet imaging once the cores were loaded in the coreholder and saturated with water each core was scanned using a clinical general electric hi speed ct scanner the scanner voltage and current settings were 120 kv and 200 ma respectively the reconstructed images had a voxel size of 0 3125 mm x 0 3125 mm x 1 25 mm the clinical ct scan was used to assist with the registration of the micro ct images with the micro pet images because the clinical ct has high enough resolution to uniquely identify large individual vesicles from the micro ct scan and the clinical ct can image the exact orientation of the core in coreholder for registration with the micro pet scan for the micro pet scans on samples kb2017a and kb2017b the fludeoxyglucose 18f fdg radiotracer was diluted into an isco pump initially containing milliq water fludeoxyglucose is a widely available conservative tracer as confirmed by radioactivity mass balance from tracer curve analysis and has a half life of 109 7 minutes these characteristics make fdg an ideal choice for multi hour tracer injection studies once mixed the solution in the tracer pump was injected through the core kb2017a 0 014 ml min kb2017b 0 2 ml min a minimum of one pore volume of fluid was injected into each sample in order to highlight the connected pores due to the difference in pore volume only 5 ml of radiotracer was injected in sample kb2017a while 30 ml of tracer was injected into kb2017b the micro pet scans were performed using a siemens pre clinical inveon dpet scanner at the stanford center for innovation in in vivo imaging the pet scans were reconstructed with 3d ordered subset expectation maximization using maximum a priori osem opmap hudson and larkin 1994 reconstructed images had square voxels with a side length of 0 8 mm for all scans 2 2 imaging analysis following image acquisition and reconstruction the micro ct and micro pet scans were manually registered with the clinical ct scans using avizo scientific 2018 the micro ct was segmented in avizo to determine the location and geometry of the vesicles and matrix while countless methods exist for porosity segmentation iassonov et al 2009 we chose to segment the micro ct images with the watershed method due to its relative ease and robustness vincent and soille 1991 examples of this segmentation for kb2017a and kb2017b are illustrated in fig 2 along with the calculated vesicle size distributions for all three samples all of the samples show a log normal distribution of pore radii as has commonly been observed in previous studies callow et al 2018 mcgrail et al 2006 shin et al 2005 song et al 2001 it is important to note that the presence of any fractures in kb2017a and some regions of the axial fracture in kb2017b are below the resolution of the micro ct and clinical ct scans once registered micro pet data and segmented micro ct data were exported to matlab the pore space identified from the micro ct images was used to calculate the total porosity and total surface area the effective porosity and effective surface area was determined by identifying the vesicles from the micro ct scan that overlapped with the location of radiotracer from the registered pet data for example see left images in fig 2 matrix material identified in the segmented micro ct scans may contain radiotracer due to 1 micro pet spatial resolution limitations 2 radiotracer present in features below the micro ct resolution i e features connecting vesicles in kb2017a or 3 slight offsets in the micro ct and micro pet plane of view as a result of different voxel sizes due to the minimal amount of radioactivity injected for the pet scans if any part of a vesicle as defined from the registered micro ct scan contained radiotracer the entire vesicle and all additional overlapping vesicles was considered connected and therefore included in the effective porosity calculations the numerical methods for calculating the porosity and surface area were the same as those used in the following section to calculate porosity and surface area in the simulation models using the same algorithms for pore structure characterization in both the imaging and numerical models provided consistency between the simulation and experimental analysis 2 3 stochastic percolation simulation to generalize the experimental observations of connectivity porosity and surface area across a range of basalt porosity microporosity in the form of microcracked vesicle rims and vesicle size distribution conditions a percolation simulator was developed to generate stochastic models of vesicle distribution percolation theory is a statistical method for describing systems that exhibit approximately random behavior bai et al 2010 blower 2001 ellis and wright 2006 sahimi 1994 walsh and saar 2008 by calculating the connectivity porosity and surface area of the vesicles in each percolation model it is possible to correlate effective porosity and surface area with total porosity the percolation simulator was written in matlab and propagates one 3d spherical vesicle during each iteration n and randomly places the vesicle in a synthetic 3d model fig 3 illustrates the center slice of an example simulation at different iterations during each iteration the radius of the propagated vesicle is determined by selecting a random value from a radii distribution array that is constructed based on a probability distribution function such as those observed experimentally right plot in fig 2 to reduce computation memory requirements the vesicle locations are recorded in an m 4 array the columns of this array contain the x y and z grid cell coordinates and vesicle identification number m is the total number of grid cells in which there is pore space in the synthetic 3d basalt model if a new vesicle is propagated on a grid cell where a vesicle is already present then the vesicles are determined to be connected and are assigned the same vesicle identification number the vesicle identification number is used to efficiently determine the extent of connectivity between vesicles in the 3d model after some incremental change in porosity usually 0 1 the following model properties are calculated total porosity ϕt defined as the total number of grid cells containing the vesicles m divided by the total number of grid cells in the model g 1 ϕ t m g effective porosity ϕe defined as the number of grid cells continuously connected to left side of model mc divided by the total number of grid cells in the model in a physical model this would be the porosity accessible by fractures spaced at 2x the synthetic model width the evolution of effective porosity versus total porosity in 50 simulations is indicated by the red lines in the top of fig 4 2 ϕ e m c g percolation threshold porosity defined as the porosity at which a volume of vesicles is continuously connected to the left and right side of the model above the percolation threshold porosity there is a path that fluid can follow through interconnected vesicles from the left side to the right side of model this is often termed the percolation threshold in percolation theory literature sahimi 1994 in a system with no fractures this would be the threshold above which it is possible to maintain large scale injection through advective fluid transport the percolation threshold porosity in 50 simulations is illustrated by the vertical black lines in the top of fig 4 total volume normalized surface area s t of all of the vesicles in the model blue lines on the bottom plot in fig 4 total volume normalized surface area is calculated by counting the number of grid cell faces that lie at the interface between all vesicles and matrix ft divided by the total number of grid cells in the model shin et al 2005 3 s t f t g volume normalized effective surface area s e of all vesicles contributing to effective porosity red lines in the bottom plot in fig 4 effective volume normalized surface area is calculated by counting the number of grid cell faces that lie at the interface between effective porosity vesicles and the matrix fe divided by the total number of grid cells in the model 4 s e f e g a simulation terminates when a specified total porosity threshold is reached e g 60 the assumptions of this percolation simulator are that there is no flow through matrix individual vesicles are spherical although clusters of individual spheres form non ideal shapes the vesicle geographical distribution is random e g no interaction from mineral crystallization and vesicle surfaces are planar due to cubic structure of the simulation grid it has been suggested that specific surface area calculations by direct counting of voxel faces may overestimate surface area due to the staircasing effect song et al 2001 however surface area calculations could also be underestimated by ignoring any vesicle surface roughness behavior that has been observed in basalt samples luhmann et al 2017 navarre sitchler et al 2013 detailed vesicle surface characterization such as the bse images in fig 1 can be used to determine whether surface smoothing or incorporation of a surface roughness factor is necessary for a given geologic sample beckingham et al 2016 wells et al 2017 all models described in this and the following section have a side length of 120 grid cells g 120 3 and a normal vesicle radius distribution with a mean radius of five grid cells sensitivity analysis described in appendix a indicates that the median trend of the percolation simulations does not vary with system size i e total number of grid cells or vesicle radii distribution indicating that detailed knowledge of vesicle topology and size distributions may not be necessary to estimate vesicle connectivity this agrees with percolation theory predictions that as system size approaches infinity a single percolation threshold value is reached sahimi 1994 physical length scales are purposely neglected in the models to highlight scale independence of the median connectivity behavior the median percolation threshold in the top of fig 4 bold black vertical line is approximately 0 32 a value nearly equal to the percolation threshold of 0 3116 predicted for a 3d simple cubic sphere system sahimi 1994 these comparisons with analytical predictions serve to validate the accuracy of the numerical model the results in the lower plot in fig 4 highlight that the effective surface area is significantly lower that the total surface area and that the relationship between surface area and total porosity is nonmonotonic as porosity of the model increases above the percolation threshold both the total and effective surface area begin to decrease due to higher vesicle overlap and connectivity this behavior is not captured in analytical expressions of surface area as a function of porosity mcgrail et al 2006 and highlights an important benefit of percolation simulation analysis 2 4 simulations accounting for microporosity petrographic thin section analysis and backscatter electron imaging from the experimental work fig 1 and observations in previous studies highlight the importance of accounting for rims of microcracks and microporosity around the vesicles in order to properly generalize vesicle connectivity to account for microporous material in the percolation simulations a rim of microporous material was added to the outside of the vesicles percolated in the synthetic model in the simulations if the microporous region overlapped between different vesicles then they were considered connected for the effective porosity calculations see fig 5 for illustration for the simulations in this study the microporous region was assumed to have no impact on total porosity or surface area however this feature could easily be assigned a secondary porosity value similar to dual porosity features commonly incorporated into transport simulation models gerke and van genuchten 1993 variation in microporous rim width was examined by running 50 simulations with each model having 1 and 2 grid cell widths of microporosity around every vesicle the effective versus total porosity results of these simulations can be seen in the fig 6 the median trend of simulations with 1 and 2 grid cell widths of microporosity are shown in fig 7 the role of larger thoroughgoing fractures on vesicle connectivity and system conductivity are beyond the scope of this study 3 results 3 1 experimental results the experimental measurements of effective porosity versus total porosity are summarized in fig 7 along with data from several studies utilizing alternative imaging methods such as neutron scattering navarre sitchler et al 2013 micro ct callow et al 2018 and synchrotron micro ct song et al 2001 for characterizing effective and total porosity of different basalts specifically the samples analyzed in navarre sitchler et al 2013 were composed of basalt porphery with plagioclase phenocrysts and the samples in song et al 2001 were vesiculated calcite filled vesiculated and scoria tephra basalts analysis in callow et al 2018 was also performed on carbfix basalt samples that had olivine tholeitte composition a summary of sample porosity and surface area measurements from the imaging registration segmentation and analysis is provided in table 2 in sample kb2017a the pet tracer experiment revealed a discrete highly localized region of flow after 6 hours of radiotracer injection as illustrated by a center slice of the segmented micro ct and micro pet in fig 2 this likely results from sub resolution microcracks and highlights the fact that most of the vesicles within the sample were disconnected this highly localized flow behavior leads to an effective porosity 2 8 that is significantly lower than the total porosity 7 6 sample kb2017c was found to have a porosity of 6 4 and the effective porosity was determined to be zero due to the very low permeability 1μd which prevented fluid transmission with the coreflooding system this is consistent with other experimental and imaging work that indicates limited connectivity and very low permeability of unfractured samples with porosity values less than 10 bai et al 2010 mueller et al 2005 as expected from the extent radiotracer distribution in fig 2 most of the vesicles in sample kb2017b were interconnected total porosity 27 1 effective porosity 26 7 near the inlet of the core nearly all of the pores were filled with radiotracer however as some of the interconnected vesicle pathways terminated there were several regions near the outlet of the core that had minimal or no radiotracer after more than one pore volume of radiotracer injection experimental measurements from this study agree well with the observations from previous studies by callow et al 2018 navarre sitchler et al 2013 song et al 2001 which found very little connected porosity in samples with less than 15 porosity between 10 and 25 porosity there is a wide range of trends between effective and total porosity and above 25 porosity effective porosity and total porosity are nearly equal several studies have observed this general relationship between effective porosity and total porosity and described this relationship with empirical percolation blower 2001 navarre sitchler et al 2009 analytical mcgrail et al 2006 or linear saar and manga 1999 functions 3 2 stochastic percolation simulation results the simulation results summarized in fig 6 and 7 demonstrate that as the thickness of the microporous rim increases the vesicles become more interconnected and therefore the effective porosity at a given total porosity increases with the addition of microporosity the simulation results are consistent with the experiments conducted here and with previously reported data fig 7 4 discussion the stochastic percolation simulation model results agree well with experimental data from this and previous studies by callow et al 2018 navarre sitchler et al 2013 song et al 2001 when microfractured vesicle rims and microporosity are taken into account the porosity of the modeled vesicular basalts increases as percolated vesicle density and total vesicle volume increases at low porosity values there is very limited connectivity in the system making fluid transmission difficult between a total porosity of 10 25 vesicle connectivity increase rapidly and as basalt porosity increases above 25 porosity most of the vesicles become interconnected above a total porosity of around 30 surface area also is shown to begin to decrease these trends in connectivity agree well with previous experimental and modeling studies analyzing permeability as a function of basalt porosity costa 2006 farquharson et al 2015 kushnir et al 2016 mueller et al 2005 use of the percolation simulation models to specifically estimate permeability as function of total porosity is an area for future work using a combination of micro ct clinical ct and micro pet it is possible to measure total porosity total surface area effective porosity and effective surface area the advantage of this method over previous experimental methods is that measurements directly observe fluid flow in the core at elevated pressures and temperatures as a basis for calculating effective porosity and surface area direct imaging of pore size and geometry provides more accurate vesicle size distributions than using the cylindrical pore model or other simplified models to infer pore sized distribution from mercury injection capillary pressure analysis in addition larger intact samples are analyzed thus reducing edge effects which tend to overestimate effective porosity for small samples previous studies utilizing the method of gas expansion pycnometry for determining connectivity in basalts found very little difference between effective porosity and total porosity except at very low 10 total porosity values saar and manga 1999 sigurosson et al 2000 while the experimental imaging data from this study and those by song et al 2001 and navarre sitchler et al 2009 as well as nonimaging based measurements described in colombier et al 2017 support the observation of very limited effective porosity below a total porosity of 10 experimental imaging measurements indicate that in some systems effective porosity may not approach total porosity until values approach or exceed 25 differences in effective porosity measurements between studies are likely the result of variability in basalt formation and weathering sample preparation potential edge effects in small samples norton and knapp 1977 and fluids e g helium versus water used to measure porosity washburn and bunting 1922 experimental data of effective porosity versus total porosity indicate several trends that vary as function of total porosity the scattering of data around these trends arise from complex variations associated with basalt formation weathering secondary mineral formation and mechanical deformation these features may result from vesicle shape variation nonrandom vesicle distribution and variability in sample microporosity and fracture extent percolation simulations illustrate the ability to approximate these complex trends observed in the experimental data and capture many of the important features that determine vesicle connectivity in heterogeneous basalts using only sample porosity approximate extent of microporosity and assuming random vesicle spatial distributions some types of basalt such as vesicular scoria or other nonrandom vesicle distributions may require percolation simulations to incorporate vesicle spatial correlations or multipoint statistics these models advance our ability to approximate and predict the connection between total porosity and effective porosity because it does not rely on regression or empirical techniques but incorporates geologically determined rock geometry vesicle size and distribution and microporosity to understand fluid connectivity in vesicular basalt systems 5 conclusions and implications the relationship between effective porosity and total porosity has important implications for estimating injectivity and storage capacity of carbon dioxide in basalt formations both experimental and simulation results from this study indicate that target formations within basalt reservoirs should ideally have total porosities of 25 and a minimum total porosity of 15 depending on fracturing and microporous behavior for vesicle connectivity high enough for sustainable injectivity as with large scale co2 storage reservoirs in sedimentary rocks the target basalt formation will also need a low permeability seal to retain injected co2 until mineral trapping occurs several previously published estimates of basalt storage capacity assume complete connectivity in basalts with total porosity values less than 15 goldberg et al 2008 mcgrail et al 2006 without detailed knowledge of extent and variation in vesicle interconnectivity at low porosity values there is serious potential for overestimating the storage volume in basalt reservoirs overestimation of formation capacity and injectivity significantly increases the risk of issues such as induced seismicity snæbjörnsdóttir and gislason 2016 results from simulations also indicate an important trend in surface area of basalts with increasing porosity as porosity of the material continues to increase above the percolation threshold both the total and effective surface area begin to decrease due to higher vesicle overlap and connectivity the trade off is that ideal carbon storage reservoirs should have maximum porosity and therefore maximum storage volume however at high porosities there will be less material and mineral surfaces available for geochemical reactions and carbonate mineral formation per volume of rock this observation is also important in the context of geothermal energy higher porosity geothermal reservoirs contain larger volumes of water and steam while higher rock fluid surface area increases geothermal heat transfer site specific studies will be necessary to optimize reservoir performance based on porosity microporosity and fracture extent in a given basalt formation the methods described in this work will enable better prediction of connectivity and transport in basaltic systems using standard porosity and thin section analysis to determine the percolation model input parameters of porosity and microporous rim dimensions there is potential for future work to incorporate these percolation models into reactive transport simulations evaluate the role of fracture density and orientation on system connectivity and use percolation simulation techniques to better predict permeability and injectivity in basalt reservoirs acknowledgments this work is funded by the global climate energy project the stanford center for carbon storage the france stanford

authors wish to thank five anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and feedback appendix a percolation simulation sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to analyze the effect of total 3d system volume and vesicle size distribution in order to test the influence of 3d system size 50 simulations with normal vesicle distributions were performed at five different system sizes 40 60 80 100 and 120 voxels i e grid cells per side length this is equal to 8 12 16 20 and 24 times the mean vesicle radius respectively results from this analysis indicate that while the variability between simulation results decreases with increasing system size the median behavior of 50 simulations in nearly identical as illustrated by the surface area calculations in fig 8 due to the low computational cost of the simulations and to prevent large outlier models all of the simulations in this study were run at 120 grid cells per side length a number of different vesicle size distributions have been observed in literature sahagian et al 1989 recorded normal lognormal bimodal and trimodal vesicle size distributions while mostly lognormal distributions were observed by mcgrail et al 2006 shin et al 2005 song et al 2001 sato et al 1997 observed unevenly random distribution of pore sizes in basalt based on these observations in literature and the lognormal vesicle radius distributions measured in the experiments four sets of simulation models were run with random normal lognormal and bimodal vesicle radius distributions see fig 9 for example distributions results of this vesicle distribution sensitivity analysis indicate that while there is variability from one simulation to another the median trend of 50 simulations produces nearly identical effective porosity percolation threshold and effective volume normalized surface area fig 10 results also indicate that vesicle radii distribution does not have a strong influence on the median percolation threshold which agrees well with observations by walsh and saar 2008 there is a slight variation in total volume normalized surface area because vesicle distributions with large numbers of small vesicles such as the lognormal distribution are expected to have a slightly higher surface area to volume ratio and thus a higher total surface area at a given total porosity level supplementary

surface modeling groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum 1 introduction groundwater dynamics significantly influence land surface processes such as evapotranspiration et infiltration runoff and groundwater recharge which further impact the atmospheric boundary layer these groundwater land surface atmosphere interactions have been addressed in a number of previous modeling studies aimed at incorporating water table dynamics into climate hydrological and land surface models chen and hu 2004 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2007 gulden et al 2007 liang et al 2003 maxwell and condon 2016 maxwell et al 2011 maxwell and miller 2005 niu et al 2007 yeh and eltahir 2005 york et al 2002 previous modeling studies have focused mainly on the impacts of shallow water tables on water and energy fluxes at the land surface these modeling efforts examined how shallow groundwater directly interacts with unsaturated zone leading to higher soil moisture and increased et chen and hu 2004 condon et al 2013 fan and miguez macho 2010 fan et al 2007 ferguson and maxwell 2010 kollet and maxwell 2008 liang et al 2003 luo et al 2013 maxwell et al 2007 maxwell and kollet 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012b niu et al 2007 rihani et al 2010 york et al 2002 these enhanced models can improve the simulation of precipitation in some regions anyah et al 2008 jiang et al 2009 and capture the changes of surface runoff and stream flow rates gusev and nasonova 2002 gutowski et al 2002 miguez macho and fan 2012a yeh and eltahir 2005 the existence of groundwater dependent vegetation can significantly influence groundwater land surface atmosphere connections maxwell et al 2007 groundwater dependent vegetation frequently occurs in lowland areas along streams around springs and within groundwater fed wetlands eamus and froend 2006 eamus et al 2006 orellana et al 2012 however upland plants namely those belonging deep rooted phreatophytic species can link relatively deep groundwater dynamics 10 m with the land surface atmosphere system bleby et al 2010 canadell et al 1996 lewis and burgy 1964 these phreatophytes can alter the groundwater land surface atmosphere connection via two mechanisms root water uptake and hydraulic redistribution hr groundwater dynamics directly link to et through groundwater uptake to support transpiration while hr indirectly impacts the groundwater land surface atmosphere interaction by redistributing soil water and groundwater throughout the soil plant atmosphere continuum dawson 1993 dawson 1996 hultine et al 2003 ludwig et al 2003 orellana et al 2012 plant root water uptake can shift between shallow and deep water sources on both seasonal and daily time scales this phenomenon has been widely observed in many species especially those with dimorphic root systems and those in water limited environments barbeta et al 2015 bleby et al 2010 dawson and pate 1996 ehleringer and dawson 1992 grossiord et al 2017 meinzer et al 1999 meinzer et al 2001 rose et al 2003 voltas et al 2015 white et al 1985 at daily scales sap flow measurements and stable isotope data indicate that plants respond to changes in soil water availability very rapidly altering the zone from which they are withdrawing water bleby et al 2010 ehleringer and dawson 1992 hultine et al 2004 scott et al 2008 on seasonal time scales plants exploit deeper sources of soil water or groundwater as the upper soil layers dewater naumburg et al 2005 if the soil is recharged after a large rainfall event plants can respond quickly markedly increasing water uptake from upper layers these shifts between deep and shallow uptake suggest that the linkages between et and soil moisture at different depths varies daily and seasonally which can significantly impact the climate when acting over a landscape scale koster and suarez 2001 maxwell and condon 2016 a number of models have addressed the impacts of groundwater dependent vegetation by incorporating the processes of groundwater uptake and hydraulic redistribution some models simulated groundwater uptake by simply using the computed transpiration multiplied by the root fraction accessing groundwater which fails to capture the shift between soil water and groundwater maxwell et al 2007 other models used the compensation method for root water uptake simulation which increases water uptake from deep soil layers and groundwater uptake when shallow soil layers were dry jarvis 2011 simunek and hopmans 2009 javaux et al 2013 ferguson et al 2016 however some compensation methods may lead to overestimation of groundwater uptake without considering that the plants may experience water stress even when they are using groundwater ferguson et al 2016 some compensation approaches may consider such water stress and reduce transpiration by multiplying potential transpiration by the root fraction reaching groundwater but these approaches result to the simultaneous water uptake from soil water and groundwater when both of they are abundant in wet season therefore these approaches fail to capture the seasonal shift of plant water sources oleson et al 2013 as reviewed by neumann and cardon 2012 a number of models of hydraulic redistribution phenomenon have been developed e g siqueira et al 2008 teodosio et al 2017 yu and d odorico 2015 although testing these models against field data e g ryel et al 2002 zheng and wang 2007 is relatively uncommon while a few have been incorporated in land surface models such as clm e g lee et al 2005 wang 2011 wang et al 2011 none of the large scale earth system frameworks routinely incorporates them in addition hydraulic redistribution can occur in senesced and dormant plants hultine et al 2004 leffler et al 2005 but few models depict this phenomenon to address the influence of groundwater dependent vegetation on subsurface land atmosphere interactions the authors previously developed a plant scale model to simulate root water uptake hydraulic redistribution hr and water stress in phreatophytic vegetation gou and miller 2014 the physically based model performed well when simulating water and energy transfer along the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac the root water uptake function proposed in the model is driven by potential gradients along the gspac which allows it to simulate both root water uptake and hr simultaneously in addition a new water stress function in the plant scale model was introduced which was based on a linear relationship between stomatal conductance and root conductance the results of the new model highlighted the seasonal and daily shift in plant water sources however this plant scale model did not address the impacts of these interactions in a wider context the objective of this study was to develop validate and apply a modeling tool capable of determining the influence of plants on the temporal and spatial interactions among groundwater and land surface processes at stand to landscape scales we incorporated the functions developed by gou and miller 2014 into a distributed groundwater land surface model parflow clm jones and woodward 2001 kollet and maxwell 2006 kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 these advancements allowed the modified model to explicitly describe plant groundwater use and hr by a range of plant species which influence both surface and subsurface water flow and alter the water and energy balances at the land surface the model advancements and limitations were discussed by comparing three model versions including our modified parflow clm model the original parflow clm model and the root water uptake compensation method introduced into parflow clm by ferguson et al 2016 we tested its performance when simulating spatial and temporal energy and water dynamics in a real world setting long term simulations of a mediterranean savanna system in california were conducted using the modified model to determine 1 how the timing and amounts of soil water uptake and groundwater uptake varied seasonally at the site and 2 when and why the groundwater dependent vegetation shifted from soil water dependence to groundwater dependence 2 modification of parflow clm 2 1 plant scale formulations of water use by phreatophytic vegetation in the formulations by gou and miller gou and miller 2014 both root water uptake and hr are driven by the water potential gradients along gspac water may flow into or out of roots depending on the direction of water potential gradient between roots and surrounding soils the net water uptake from all layers equals transpiration assuming that the plant water storage does not change a reference point is defined in the model which refers to the junction point between the root system and stem located at the same elevation of the ground surface for a single root the process of water absorption is depicted as 1 q r o o t 2 π l k s o i l ψ s o i l ψ s o i l ψ r o o t ln b r where qroot is the root water uptake rate l3t 1 ψsoil is the soil water potential l ψroot is the root water potential l ksoil ψsoil is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil lt 1 we assume that all roots are first order roots that directly connect to the reference point in a parallel circuit configuration each root is considered to have a transporting part and an absorbing part which is a short absorbing zone behind the root tip b is the distance from the edge of the rhizosphere zone to the axis of the root l l is the length of the absorbing root portion l and r is the root diameter l therefore the surface area of the absorbing root portion of a single root is 2πrl gou and miller 2014 all roots are assumed to have the same surface area of the absorbing portion the root water storage is assumed to be negligible the absorbed water is continuously moved through the transporting root to the reference point 2 q r o o t π r 2 k r o o t ψ r o o t ψ r o o t ψ r e f z 0 5 l l z where kroot ψroot is the hydraulic conductivity of the absorbing and transporting root portions lt 1 ψref is the potential at the reference point l l is the horizontal length of the transporting root portion l and z is the vertical length of the transporting root portion l which equals to the vertical depth from the soil layer to the reference point combining eqs 1 and 2 to eliminate ψroot the water flow from or release

which is the ratio of the number of roots within the ith layer to the total number of roots at a root is the total area of the absorbing root surface of the whole plant l2 froot i at a root represents the total area of the absorbing root surface within the ith layer the xylem potential at the reference point ψref is further used to estimate the changes of water potential within the above ground plant portions by accounting for the energy consumed overcoming gravitational potential and the frictional resistance to water flow along the pathway from the reference point to leaves the resistance of water flowing from surrounding soil into roots and vice versa is denoted as γs i tl 1 l whereas γr i refers to the resistance to transport water from the root tip to the reference point tl 1 l the equations for γs i and γr i and their derivations can be found in gou and miller 2014 soil and plant hydraulic conductivities vary depending on soil and plant water potential status and such relationships were described by van genuchten curves and species specific vulnerability curves sperry et al 1988 sperry and tyree 1988 tyree and sperry 1989 respectively when ψsoil i ψref zi 0 the potential gradient drives the water uptake from surrounding soil into roots in the ith layer while when ψsoil i ψref zi 0 the negative potential gradient implies that water is released from roots to surrounding soils therefore eq 3 estimates both root water uptake and hydraulic redistribution rates simultaneously the plant water storage is assumed to be negligible therefore the total net water uptake from all layers equals to the transpiration of the whole plant 4 t a t a r o o t a l e a f i 1 m f r o o t i ψ s o i l i ψ r e f z i γ s i γ r i where t is the plant transpiration rate per unit

species specific experimentally measured vulnerability curve matzner et al 2001 venturas et al 2017 in this study we used the linear relationship between stomatal conductance and root conductance as the plant water stress function rather than the relationship between stomata and whole plant conductance used in some literature sperry et al 2003 roots are generally more vulnerable to cavitation than the trunks and branches sperry and ikeda 1997 choat et al 2005 domec et al 2009 johnson et al 2016 which implies that roots are likely to be a critical hydraulic bottleneck in whole plant water transport when water is limited as the soil dries root conductance declines fast and becomes the dominant regulator of whole plant conductance steudle 2000 domec et al 2004 domec et al 2009 the measurements indicated that maximum daily stomatal conductance declined linearly with increasing afternoon loss of root conductivity over the course of the dry season domec et al 2006 during the drought the stomatal conductance may decline with the root xylem embolism the adjustment of stomata conductance could avoid hydraulic failure in roots based on our modifications the stomatal conductance was calculated in clm as a linear function of ξ which further reduced transpiration when water was limited 2 2 original parflow clm parflow clm was developed by coupling the parallel integrated hydrology model parflow and the land surface model clm jefferson et al 2017 kollet and maxwell 2006 kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 with clm incorporated into parflow as a module each soil column in parflow has one corresponding clm cell to calculate the water and energy fluxes at the land surface for its specific land cover type kollet and maxwell 2008 the surface and subsurface hydrology formulations in clm are replaced by parflow which simulates variably saturated soil water groundwater movements and overland flow the two models communicate with each other over the root zone at every time step parflow passes information on soil moisture and depth to groundwater to clm clm then factors this subsurface information into its calculation of infiltration transpiration and root water uptake the infiltration and root water uptake rates are then passed back to parflow where they are treated as sinks sources in the richards equation as a result the coupled parflow clm can describe how hydrological and ecological processes are related to the vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of vegetation topography and hydrogeology atchley and maxwell 2011 condon and maxwell 2014 ferguson and maxwell 2010 kollet and maxwell 2008 mikkelson et al 2013 rihani et al 2010 2 3 incorporating phreatophyte functions into original parflow clm in order to properly represent phreatophytes in parflow clm we replaced its original functions with those described in section 2 1 in parflow clm s original root uptake function the total transpiration was distributed over layers within root zone according to the root fraction in each layer dai et al 2003 this approach suggests that plants extracted water simultaneously from each layer at the same water uptake rate per unit root fraction in the original function in the new function eqs 1 3 root water uptake from each layer is controlled by the individual layer s water potential the root water potential and the soil root resistance incorporating the new function allowed the model to simulate root water uptake using a more physically based approach also allowing it to capture both hydraulic lift and hydraulic descent when plant was active and dormant furthermore the new root water uptake function could capture seasonal and daily shifts in plant water sources these shifts are a critical phenomenon in groundwater dependent vegetation since phreatophytes may switch to use groundwater to buffer the impacts of drought when soil water is depleted in the new root water uptake function the shift in plant water sources automatically occurred driven by the potential differences the groundwater uptake was also limited by the changes of resistance along gspac second the original plant water stress function in parflow clm dai et al 2003 was replaced with eq 5 the original function in parflow clm was based on the commonly used feddes equation which describes plant water stress as a piecewise function of matric potential which predicts a linear reduction in evapotranspiration when matric potential decreases from the stress point to the wilting point feddes et al 1978 federer 1979 feddes et al 2001 as it is typically implemented in land surface models like clm this formulation has several drawbacks in simulating the dynamics of groundwater dependent vegetation javaux et al 2013 argued that the formulation can only consider the impacts of plant hydraulic architecture through effective parameterization and fails to account for the changes of root resistances it also neglects the influence of root activity on plant water stress making it unable to simulate water stress in deep rooted plants where the root systems expand across layers with highly varying water content in such situations some roots in wetter layers may be more active with lower cavitation while other roots in drier layers maybe less active in addition the transpiration was set to zero in the original water stress function when the soil water content of the top soil layer dropped below the wilting point which could occur due to soil evaporation this assumption incorrectly suggested that plants stop transpiration when the shallow soil water reservoir are depleted instead of exploiting deeper soil water and groundwater thus this function was not suitable for the simulation of deep rooted plants during droughts the new function integrated the influence of various soil water contents groundwater and root activity on plant water stress after making the replacement the stomatal conductance calculated by parflow clm was linearly limited by the plant water stress ξ in eq 5 rather than the aggregate soil water availability the wilting point and stress point were not needed in the new water stress function instead the species specific xylem vulnerability curves were required finally a new vegetation functional type winter grass was added into the model for application to our study site the original parflow clm model contained only one grass type which is active based on the soil temperature dai et al 2003 the green up and senescence of the new winter grass type were controlled by the soil moisture in the top soil layer representing the behavior of the dominant grass species on site in the modified parflow clm only the old functions in clm were replaced by our new functions e g root water uptake and hydraulic redistribution functions plant water stress function and winter grass phenology function all functions in parflow remain the same therefore these new functions could be incorporated into other land surface models as well such as the stand alone version of clm in the community earth system model cesm in the modified model the root hydraulic conductivity k root i ψ root i declines as the root water potential ψ root i decreases making ψ root i a critical variable in the calculations of plant water uptake release rate and transpiration however the root water potential ψ root i is also related to the plant water uptake release rate and transpiration therefore the modified model was solved iteratively at the beginning of simulation the initial water potential for each layer was set in parflow the initial condition of root water potential ψ root i was set equal to the soil water potential nearby the initial condition of root water potential ψ root i was used to calculate the loss of root hydraulic conductance and the plant water stress function ξ in eq 5 to give the value of transpiration t the transpiration value t was then used in eq 4 to solve for the water potential at the reference point ψ ref which further gave the results of root water uptake from a certain soil layer qi in eq 3 according to how much water was absorbed from the specific layer into the roots or released from roots to the layer q the soil water potential ψsoil the root water potential ψroot was calculated in eq 1 therefore the initial root water potential ψroot value was updated the same procedure was repeated using the updated root water potential until the model converged 3 model application 3 1 study site we tested the modified model against measurements from a savanna ecosystem in order to gauge its performance when predicting storage and fluxes of water and energy the tonzi ranch a blue oak savanna in the lower foothills of the western sierra nevada in california latitude 38 4311 n longitude 120 966 w was selected as a case study site baldocchi 2017 its mediterranean climate leads to wet mild winters and dry hot summers baldocchi et al 2004 chen et al 2008b ma et al 2007 the mean annual precipitation is approximately 560 mm most of which occurs between october and may wet season chen et al 2008b miller et al 2010 determined that deciduous blue oaks quercus douglasii the dominant woody vegetation type at this site are obligate phreatophytes and that plant groundwater use supports most transpiration during dry seasons the phenology of blue oaks is tightly related to temperature leaf out occurs at the end of march and senescence around the beginning of october in contrast the grasses at the site are annual species and only rely on soil water ma et al 2007 their green up typically occurs in november when the wet season begins and they senesce in may of the next year when the soil becomes dry ma et al 2007 the site has shallow rocky silt loam soils that are approximately 60 100 cm deep and are underlain by a 4 8 m saprolite zone followed by fractured metamorphic bedrock the water table depth ranges from 7 12 m across the site miller et al 2010 depending on the season and the ground surface elevation a suite of micrometeorological and hydrological measurements have been collected at the site since 2001 two eddy covariance towers one in the overstory 23 m height above tree canopy and one in the understory 2 m height under tree canopy measure fluxes of co2 water vapor and sensible heat using the eddy covariance method miller et al 2010 continuous soil moisture measurements have been collected at half hourly intervals using a total of three theta probes delta t devices model ml2 x cambridge united kingdom located under the canopy at depths of 5 10 and 20 cm soil heat flux was measured using three replicate plates all at a 3 cm depth hfp01sc hukseflux delft the netherlands in addition time domain reflectometry probes moisture point model 917 environmental sensors inc victoria british columbia were installed at nine locations five under tree canopy and four in the open spaces at depths of 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 45 cm and 45 60 cm to measure soil moisture weekly or every two weeks chen et al 2008b midday and predawn leaf water potentials of blue oak leaves sampled at a height of 2 3 m were measured at two week intervals in the oak active season miller et al 2010 osuna 2011 three observation wells were drilled to manually measure water table depth at two week intervals since may 2007 depth to groundwater has been automatically recorded at half hourly intervals in one well using a vented pressure transducer wl400 global water sacramento california miller et al 2010 other variables such as leaf area index stomatal conductance and plant height have been periodically monitored baldocchi 2017 3 2 model setup the model domain consisted of a 200 m 200 m surface area and extended to a depth of 15 m previous lidar images showed 43 coverage by deciduous blue oak 52 by annual grass and 5 by evergreen grey pine fig 1 chen et al 2008a the model domain was discretized into 100 100 28 cells with a lateral resolution of 2 m δx δy 2 m and variable vertical resolutions δz ranging from δz 0 2 m for soil layers and layers within the range of water table fluctuations to δz 0 8 m for saprolite layers the soil thickness ranged from 60 cm to 100 cm four lateral boundaries were defined as monthly variable constant head boundary conditions based on groundwater depth measurements from three nearby wells the bottom of the computational domain was set as a no flow boundary vegetation distribution and land surface elevation ranging from 166 m to 170 m were obtained from the lidar imagery chen et al 2008a in the model simulation only the blue oaks were considered to be phreatophytes with their tap roots reaching the groundwater table while the grasses and pines solely relied on soil water with their shallow roots terminating above the soil saprolite interface only one vegetation cover type was assigned to each surface model cell neglecting grasses occurring under the tree canopy a simplification necessary for using clm four soil types were used to represent the top soil layer the middle and deeper soil layers the saprolite layer and the bedrock layers the van genuchten parameters of these four soil types were based on previously obtained site data miller 2009 gou and miller 2014 most parameter values for blue oaks were the same as the ones used in gou and miller 2014 therefore no further calibrations were conducted only the parameters of root distribution were different from the ones in gou and miller 2014 here we specified 45 of roots in 0 20 cm soil layer the top soil layer 30 of roots in 20 40 cm soil layer the middle soil layer 15 of roots in the soil layers ranging from 40 to 100 cm depth the deep soil layers based on the dimorphic nature of oak rooting patterns and a lack of appropriate measurements we assumed that 10 of roots were present in the saprolite layer but future model revisions could easily incorporate actual root distribution if new data becomes available the xylem vulnerability curve of blue oaks used in this model was modified based on the root xylem vulnerability curve of oaks measured by matzner et al 2001 see gou and miller 2014 the modified model only considered drought induced root cavitation while frost induced root cavitation was not included this simplification was reasonable for the application at tonzi site where the soil temperature remained above 0 c 3 3 simulation setup first the modified parflow clm model was used to conduct three dimensional stand scale simulations and the model results were compared to field data conditions at the site were simulated for 8 years years 2002 2009 with a half hourly time step the modified model was forced with incoming radiation wind speed and direction surface air temperature precipitation atmospheric pressure and relative humidity measured at the study site the model performance was tested by comparing the model results and measurements at daily and hourly temporal scales and at multiple spatial locations 1 the half hourly model results averaged over the whole domain were summarized into daily results to compare against the 8 year measurements of overstory et understory et point measurements of soil moisture at different depths and available predawn leaf water potential data 2 the half hourly model results for latent heat again averaged over the whole domain were compared against the half hourly measurements from 23 m overstory eddy covariance tower to test if the model captured diurnal changes of latent heat in different seasons and years for both analyses we assumed that the energy and water fluxes from the domain 200 m 200 m 15 m were representative of the fluxes from the footprints of both overstory and understory eddy covariance towers the overstory tower located at a height of 23 m measured the fluxes from soil grasses and trees within the domain while the understory tower at a height of 2 m captured the fluxes from soil and grasses within the domain 3 the model simulation from year 2004 drier year and 2005 wetter year were chosen to analyze the spatial patterns of soil moisture dynamics under different vegetation covers as measured by the spatially distributed tdr probes second the modified parflow clm version was compared to two other parflow clm versions these model versions were used to conduct simulations at the same study area with the same model parameterization used in the modified model in order to test the model performances especially in simulating phreatophytic water use one version was the original parflow clm in the original model the root water uptake was treated as simultaneous water uptake from different layers according to root fraction without explicit consideration of the water availability in each layer when the top soil layer at the land surface dropped below the wilting point the transpiration was shut off to eliminate root water uptake from the dry top soil layer the plant stress function in the original parflow clm model was the commonly used feddes function which required the parameters of wilting points i e 3 mpa for the blue oaks and pines and 1 2 mpa for the winter grass in the simulation another version was based on the root water uptake function proposed by ferguson et al 2016 ferguson et al 2016 introduced a rescaled approach into parflow clm model which maintained transpiration until all layers in root zone fell below wilting point this approach rescaled the root fraction over layers above wilting point using the equation ferguson et al 2016 6 f r o o t i f r o o t i δ ψ i ψ w i l t i 1 n f r o o t i δ ψ i ψ w i l t where f root i is the rescaled root fraction within the ith layer δ ψ i ψ wilt is equal to 1 if ψi ψwilt or 0 if ψi ψwilt therefore the plant would continue to take water from the deep layers with available water during the dry seasons the root fraction was renormalized over the remaining layers above the wilting point the root fraction was set to zero when all layers were below the wilting point it was a root water uptake compensation method we referred this model version as compensation version the plant stress function was the same as the one used in the original parflow clm version third once confirming the modified model s ability to reproduce key ecohydrologic variables we further used the modified model to conduct scenario test to analyze the impacts of plant groundwater use the groundwater uptake of blue oaks was turned off by altering the root distribution so that the deep roots were not present and the root zone was constrained within soil layers this scenario was constructed to analyze the xylem cavitation with without groundwater uptake in order to explore how blue oaks used groundwater to avoid drought induced hydraulic failure 4 results 4 1 modified model results and measurements comparison daily time scale micrometeorological conditions at the site were typical given its mediterranean climate fig 2 during the 2002 2009 interval years 2004 and 2008 were the driest with an average annual precipitation of 440 mm while years 2005 and 2006 were the wettest with an average annual precipitation of 750 mm net radiation rn measured 23 m above the ground averaged 3 15 gj m2 year the energy balance was computed based on the latent heat le sensible heat h and soil heat g flux measurements fig 2 neglecting storage in the canopy air space and biomass as per wilson et al 2002 the comparison between measured rn and measured le h g implied that significant energy imbalance occurred during all winters and during the springs and summers of wet years the absolute value of rn le h g rn was over 30 for a total of 24 of days while this site provided reliable data with high degree of energy balance closure baldocchi et al 2004 wilson et al 2002 the issue was still important as it can significantly influence model calibration and validation foken 2008 the total evapotranspiration ettotal was measured using the 23 m overstory eddy covariance tower which captured the stand scale fluxes fig 3 initially the modeled and measured results showed a positive correlation with r2 0 72 fig 3 bottom left however the modified model failed to match the measured ettotal during all winter periods when significant energy imbalance occurred fig 2 significant energy imbalance in early spring during 2005 and 2006 fig 2 also corresponded with clear mismatches between modeled and measured ettotal at the same time fig 3 when days with poor closure i e daily rn le h g rn 30 were removed from consideration the agreement between the modeled and measured et data improved substantially with r2 0 85 fig 3 bottom right additionally the model simulated dew deposition and generated negative values in et during the winter months the measured understory et etunder fig 4 was estimated from the measurements from the 2 m understory eddy covariance tower which captured the fluxes from grasses and soil the measured etunder was compared to the modeled etunder averaged from et of grass covered areas and the soil evaporation under the tree canopy over the entire model domain fig 4 again after removing the results for the days with poor energy budget closure measurements the correlation between modeled and measured data was improved from r2 0 43 fig 4 bottom left to 0 66 fig 4 bottom right however etunder was still underestimated by around 30 likely due to the model s exclusion of the grasses under the tree canopy in the modified model the moisture control phenology of winter grass required the critical soil water potential to control grass green up and senescence the critical soil water potential for winter grass was set to 1 2 mpa making it active in the winter when soil water potential in the top 20 cm depth of soil exceeded 1 2 mpa and senescent when soil water potential at the top soil layer dropped below 1 2 mpa this relationship helped to capture the changes of etunder fig 4 with soil moisture fig 5 especially the fast decrease in etunder after the rainy season ceased according to this relationship the modeled average grass green up date was the 317th day of year and the modeled average grass senescence date was the 148th day of year these results compared well with ma et al s 2007 observations for years 2000 2006 which showed grass green up dates between days 314 and 362 and senescence dates between days 129 and 162 the new formulation in the modified model allowed for the simulation of leaf water potential changes for every time step which can be used to explore water stress in plants leaf water potential measurements for blue oaks were available during the growing seasons of years 2002 2003 and 2007 osuna 2011 the model generally matched the trends of the measured predawn and midday leaf water potential fig 5 for each year the predawn water potential was high approximately 0 2 mpa during the wet seasons when soil water potential was high it decreased dramatically following the rapid decrease of soil water potential from may to june during dry months from june to september the predawn leaf water potential dropped to between 4 and 6 mpa when rains commenced during september and october the predawn leaf water potential quickly rebounded reaching approximately 0 2 mpa the midday leaf water potential also remained high during the wet season declined dramatically from may to june and rebounded after the winter rainfall the difference between the predawn and midday water potential was relatively small during the wet and transitional seasons while the difference became more significant during the dry seasons the results indicated that leaf water potential responded to the soil water potential dynamics quickly for the inter annual changes the predawn and midday leaf water potentials during dry seasons were lower in dry years year 2004 and 2008 we chose the modeled soil moisture results at the location where the soil moisture sensors were installed to compare against measurements at different depths fig 5 the model generally matched the measurements however from may to august the model results exhibited more rapid soil drying than the observations soil evaporation tends to be overestimated in clm lawrence et al 2007 our results suggest this is likely the case as well in our model a rapid decrease of soil moisture at the beginning of dry season in may led to a mismatch with the measurements which showed a more gradual decrease during dry season fig 5 in addition the permeability in the fractured saprolite zone was highly uncertain which also may have affected the model s accuracy in the upper soil zones by altering drainage rates 4 2 modified model results and measurements comparison diurnal time scale we further examined the modified model performance in simulating the diurnal changes of latent heat we chose the results from four biophysically representative time periods fig 6 the wet season during winter when the oaks were dormant and the grasses were active labeled wet january the wet season during spring wet april the transitional period between wet and dry seasons when both the oaks and grasses were active transitional may and the dry season during summer when the oaks were active and the grasses were senescent dry august during each season we calculated the half hourly average le over a five day period only consecutive days with a high degree of observed energy budget closure were used the modeled latent heat generally followed the diurnal patterns found in the measured results albeit with some notable exceptions the modeled values tended to be lower during nighttime especially during the winter wet season i e january in fig 6 one possible cause the model can simulate dew while the measurements from eddy covariance tower did not capture dew during the night this phenomenon became more obvious in winter nights when temperature was low both overestimations e g may 2005 and 2009 and underestimations e g may 2003 2007 and 2008 of midday latent heat occurred fig 6 these mismatches did not show any seasonal or annual biases and occurred in both wet and dry years we suspect one reason of these mismatches was that the model domain did not represent the footprint of the eddy covariance tower miller 2009 the footprint of 23 m overstory tower captures information up to 500 m from the tower ring 2014 way beyond the 200 m 200 m model domain the footprint of tower most frequently covers the lower left quadrant of the model domain miller 2009 since the spatial dimension of the flux footprint was not fixed and it changed with the atmospheric conditions wilson et al 2002 the modeled results from the fixed model domain may overestimate or underestimate the measured flux captured in the dynamic footprint 4 3 modified model results and measurements comparison spatial patterns we compared modeled soil moisture values at nine locations where tdrs were installed and plotted them against the values measured at 10 cm depth in year 2004 and 2005 fig 7 the modeled results from five points under oak canopies were averaged to compare to the averaged value from five tdrs measurements at the same locations the averaged modeled and measured soil moisture results from four points under grasses in the open spaces were also compared the modeled results generally captured the soil moisture changes under different vegetation covers during the dry seasons during the wet winter seasons the modeled soil moisture values under oak were slightly lower than the soil moisture under grasses the difference was more obvious in the measurements which may due to the effects of soil heterogeneity after major precipitation events ceased in may soil moisture decreased rapidly and the soil water content under oak and grass were differentiated due to unequal plant water uptake and soil evaporation rates the soil moisture beneath grasses decreased more slowly than the soil moisture under oaks did this pattern became more obvious when comparing the model results of spatial and seasonal changes in soil moisture at different depths fig 8 the differences in moisture of soils located under different species fig 1 could be easily distinguished fig 8 the monthly spatial variance of the soil moisture was calculated using the measurements from nine time domain reflectometry probes installed at different locations the variance of the modeled results only generally followed the variance of the measured data during the dry season but failed to match the variance of the measured data during the wet season fig 9 a in the model simulation individuals of the same species were assigned the same species specific parameters for example every oak tree had the same leaf area index and root distribution therefore the soil moisture results under the same species were very similar and only slightly altered by topographic factors in addition the soil type at the same depth was set to be homogenous in the model during the wet season the spatial variance of the measured soil moisture was more significant it may be due to the effects of soil heterogeneity and leaf area of each plant which impacted the canopy interception infiltration and soil water content the model ignored the heterogeneity of soil and leaf area index which led to more homogenous results with low variance during the wet seasons however during the dry season the soil moisture across the domain all approached to the very low level when the net radiation was high therefore the soil heterogeneity and leaf area index were not the dominant factors to impact the soil moisture variance during the dry seasons 4 4 three model version comparison we compared the results of blue oak transpiration soil moisture distribution and root water uptake from the original and modified parflow clm models when transpiration was predominately energy limited from march to may the transpiration results from two model versions were highly correlated fig 9 however significant differences occurred during dry seasons when transpiration became water limited in the original model when soil water content of the top soil layer dropped below the wilting point transpiration stopped abruptly in the compensation model the transpiration rate was maintained at rates near the potential et rates when the oak was using groundwater the results indicated that the oak did not experience severe water stress when accessing the constant water source from the saturated zone in the root water uptake compensation method the spatial variance in latent heat of three methods fig 9b also indicated that the compensation model showed great variance during the dry season because the groundwater dependent oaks maintained high transpiration rate while the other plants almost ceased transpiration in the modified model the transpiration also continued with the water support from deep soil and groundwater however the results from the modified model showed that the transpiration had significant decrease during the dry season which implied that the oaks still encountered severe water stress when accessing the reliable groundwater source the measurements of predawn leaf water potential during the dry season dropped to between 4 to 6 mpa fig 5 indicating that the plants experienced severe water stress with groundwater uptake only the modified model captured the transpiration dynamics fig 10 the soil moisture results of the top soil layer were similar from both models for the middle and deep soil layers the soil moisture results were similar during wet seasons but significantly different during dry seasons in the original model because the transpiration stopped during dry seasons the water uptake from the middle and deep soil layers also ceased as a result the soil water content of the middle and deep soil layers remained high in the original model in the compensation model and the modified model the simulated soil moisture results for all layers were similar in general the transpiration and soil moisture results from all three models were similar during wet seasons indicating that three models may have similar performance when they were applied in wet seasons regions the soil moisture results of the top soil layer were similar during both wet and dry seasons implying that all three models may yield similar results in the simulations of shallow rooted vegetation however the performance of three models was significantly different during dry seasons it indicated that three models had substantial difference in the simulations of dry seasons regions with deep rooted vegetation accessing groundwater we further analyzed the results of root water uptake from different layers in the model fig 11 in the original model the root water uptake from a specific layer was calculated using the computed transpiration multiplied by the root fraction in the layer ferguson et al 2016 therefore the modeled root water uptake from different layers occurred simultaneously and was proportional to the total transpiration fig 11 in the compensation model water stress was calculated according to the available moisture within the layers above the wilting point the computed transpiration was distributed over the layers with available moisture according to the rescaled root fraction therefore the ratio of root water uptake from different layers changed with the changes of available moisture and rescaled root fraction however because the root water uptake compensation method only considered the layers above wilting point in its water stress calculation it led to nearly no stress condition when soil layers were dry and the saturated layer became the only layer to support transpiration therefore fig 11 showed that the groundwater uptake increased significantly during the dry seasons the transpiration reached to the rates near the potential et by unlimited water uptake from groundwater it led to overestimation of plant groundwater use during the dry seasons in the modified model the root water uptake was determined by the potential gradients and the resistances along gspac thus the modeled water uptake from different sources varied daily and seasonally and showed the dynamics of hydraulic redistribution fig 11 during wet seasons the root water uptake from the top soil layer in the modified model was slightly higher than the results from the original and the compensation models because the modified model tended to take more soil water when it was adequate the top soil water uptake results from three models decreased abruptly at the same time when the top soil water reservoir was depleted during dry seasons the root water uptake from all sources stopped in the original model the root water uptake from groundwater maintained et at rates near the reference value in the compensation model simulations while the root water uptake continued at lower rates with severe water stress in the modified model the low groundwater uptake rate was mainly determined by the reduction of root conductance during the dry season in the modified model groundwater was absorbed by the tap root and transferred upwards energy was consumed in this process to overcome the resistance within the tap roots and the gravitational potential which led to the reduction of root water potential within tap roots the tap root conductivity decreased as the root water potential reduced which limited the tap root ability to absorb and transfer groundwater therefore the plants were not able to absorb and transfer groundwater at the maximum rate close to the potential et the plants experienced water stress even though they were accessing reliable groundwater in addition the root water uptake in the modified model showed the results of hydraulic redistribution the soil water uptake in the modified model was mainly positive during the daytime and negative during the nighttime while groundwater uptake was positive during the nighttime indicating the occurrence that groundwater was lifted and released to soil layers during dry seasons the modified model also shows that hydraulic descent usually occurred following the rainfall events during dry seasons during occasional rainfall events e g the rainfall events during dry season of 2003 and hydraulic descent was triggered the precipitation stored in the top soil layer was taken and transferred downward to recharge deeper layers when autumn rains commenced hydraulic descent occurred even when the oaks were dormant the magnitude of hydraulic descent decreased as the potential gradients among layers diminished 5 discussion 5 1 improvements in the modified model several new features were introduced in the modified model to improve its performance especially in simulating deep rooted vegetation in a water limited environment the modified model predicted leaf water potentials which were not included in most land surface models although they serve as critical indicators of plant water status the model results showed that the dynamics of predawn leaf water potential are linked to soil water potential during the wet season before may tightly coupled to groundwater depth and plant hydraulic structure during dry seasons and finally recover with autumn rainfalls similar dynamics of predawn leaf water potential was reported in other mediterranean oaks david et al 2007 during dry seasons the predawn leaf water potential dropped to between 4 and 6 mpa indicating the blue oaks suffered severe water stress even when they shifted to using groundwater groundwater uptake may not be able to meet the high evaporation demand during dry seasons because of the limitations of plant hydraulic structure e g limitation in xylem hydraulic conductance and cavitation in tap roots therefore the shift in water sources the utilization of groundwater and hr may all be necessary for oaks to buffer the effect of prolonged summer drought although these strategies are unable to fully alleviate plant water stress grossiord et al 2017 however accessing groundwater is still critical because it helps plants avoid drought induced hydraulic failure the unmodified model predicted 100 cavitation in the shallow roots in the top soil layer usually in the middle of july in the dry years or in the middle of august in the wet years even the modified model predicted that in the driest period of mid august the loss of conductance in the root system could reach 82 the model scenario test suggests that plant groundwater use prevented hydraulic failure of the shallow roots via two mechanisms 1 when groundwater was accessible plants switched to use groundwater instead of exploiting more soil water during droughts and 2 when groundwater served as the source of hydraulic lift to recharge shallow roots and surrounding soil both mechanisms prevented soil water potential and shallow root water potential to drop to extremely low values and avoid 100 cavitation in the shallow roots the original root water uptake function which extracts water from different layers simultaneously according to the root fraction is typical of those used in hydrologic and land surface models the function is computationally efficient but it does not consider the moisture availability and root activity within each layer thus it may result in continuous water uptake from extremely dry layers to cope with this issue the original function shuts off transpiration when top soil moisture falls below the wilting point it eliminates water uptake from the top dry soil layer during droughts and also prohibits water uptake from deeper layers where moisture is still available it also failed to capture the seasonal shift of plant water sources previous models used root water uptake compensation to account for heterogeneity in soil water availability e g hopmans and bristows 2002 jarvis 2011 simunek and hopmans 2009 javaux et al 2013 ferguson et al 2016 we compared our modified model with the compensation method introduced by ferguson et al 2016 which used a rescaled root fraction approach to redistribute the water uptake over the layers and maintain transpiration until all layers within the root zone fall below wilting point it was one root water uptake compensation method and allowed plants to exploit deep water sources during dry seasons however this approach resulted to unlimited water uptake from groundwater during the dry season since it assumed that the roots accessing groundwater are not water stressed it failed to match the dry season transpiration under severe water stress the new root water uptake function solves these problems considering the dynamics of potential gradients and resistances along the gspac the new function gradually diminishes water uptake from drying layers and increased water use from layers with available moisture it allows plants to use deep water sources when the top soil layer is dry and also captures the shift of plant water sources it is especially suitable for simulations in dry regions seasons with deep rooted vegetation and in places where hr is known to occur the function captured both hydraulic lift and hydraulic descent during plant active and dormant seasons which may have significant hydrological and ecological effects the original plant water stress function was one of the most commonly used functions in hydrologic and land surface models stomatal conductance was inversely related to a water stress factor which was a piecewise linear function of soil water content or soil water potential the water stress factor represents the aggregate moisture availability over the root zone and needed the parameters of stress point i e field capacity in original parflow clm and wilting point for its calculation the new plant water stress function is based on the relationship found in experimental studies showing that the stomatal conductance decreases linearly with the loss of root hydraulic conductance domec et al 2009 the loss of root hydraulic conductance is calculated according to the root water potential and the species specific vulnerability curve instead of assigning a wilting point the new function considers the plant vulnerability to drought in its water stress calculation therefore the new model is able to predict that the predawn leaf water potential of blue oaks during the prolonged drought dropped to around 6 mpa which is much lower than the wilting point value conventionally used in other models but it has been consistently measured at the site 5 2 implications of groundwater uptake we first analyzed the evidence of groundwater uptake from the measured data at our study site miller et al 2010 found that the blue oaks at this site switched to take more water from saturated zone when soil water was depleted in dry seasons we followed the white loheide method loheide et al 2005 white 1932 reported in the study of miller et al 2010 using diurnal water table fluctuation data to estimate groundwater consumption by the blue oaks at this site the diurnal water table fluctuation method isolated the daily change in groundwater driven by plant groundwater uptake from the overall seasonal trends in the water table level miller et al 2010 continuous groundwater measurements with half hourly time interval were collected at the tonzi site since may 2007 the daily groundwater uptake rate was estimated from may 2007 to december 2009 except two major measurement gaps from january 2008 to march 2008 and from august 2008 to september 2008 fig 12 considerable uncertainty and errors in this estimation may be attributed to the measurements the assumptions the parameter value selection and the method itself see discussions in miller et al 2010 this method shows that groundwater uptake starts increasing in may when soil moisture is decreasing and reached the maximum rate around june when net radiation was the highest however the total et measured from the overstory eddy covariance tower began decreasing in may this indicates that at the beginning of dry season in may soil water uptake decreases rapidly and plants switch from soil water dependence to groundwater dependence compared to the wetter year 2009 the estimated groundwater uptake in the drier year 2008 increased earlier and had a greater contribution to the total et this indicates that the time and duration of groundwater uptake is tightly related to precipitation consistent with bleby et al s 2010 findings our modified model generally matches the trend of increasing and decreasing in groundwater uptake from may to september and captures the seasonal shift in plant water sources the modeled groundwater uptake and the estimated values from the groundwater fluctuation data from may 2007 to december 2009 show good agreement fig 12 because only the blue oaks are considered to reach groundwater in the model simulation the modeled groundwater uptake drops to nearly zero when blue oak canopy was dormant from mid october to mid march next year however the estimated groundwater uptake continues to occur at a low rate after the blue oaks senesced which may be due to groundwater usage by the evergreen grey pines at this site or may due to bole evaporation by blue oaks therefore the modeled groundwater uptake results are slightly lower than the estimated values from water table fluctuation the modeled groundwater uptake in the 8 year simulation shows that the groundwater uptake by blue oaks supports most dry season et while soil water supports most wet season et at the site during the dry seasons over 60 of total et during june july august and september came from groundwater uptake the highest groundwater contribution to dry season total et occurred in year 2008 72 and the lowest happened in year 2005 36 this finding implies that groundwater acts as a buffer during dry years but soil water is used preferentially during wet years 5 3 shift in water sources the model simulation allowed us to find the critical soil moisture point at which plants switch from soil water dependence to groundwater dependence for example the time when groundwater uptake started increasing i e groundwater uptake started to exceed 10 of total plant water uptake corresponds to the time when the volumetric soil water content of top soil layer dropped to around 0 10 m3 m3 fig 12 this point can then be related to the van genuchten curves used in the model simulation for the top 20 cm soil layer fig 13 baseline the slope of the curve changes dramatically when soil water content approaches the critical soil water content value 0 10 m3 m3 corresponding to a soil water potential of 0 26 mpa green dot on the baseline in fig 13 this implies that when soil moisture dropped below the threshold of 0 10 m3 m3 a slight decrease in soil water content would lead to dramatic decreases in soil water potential and soil hydraulic conductivity in that situation if plants extract a small amount of water from the soil it needs to overcome a large amount of negative potential caused by dramatic decrease in soil water potential and resistance caused by a dramatic decrease in soil hydraulic conductivity it is at this point that groundwater uptake starts to become more thermodynamically favorable than soil water uptake and the plants subsequently increase their groundwater uptake in contrast during wet seasons soil layers and the layers near water table are all wet with relatively high water potential and hydraulic conductivity because groundwater is relatively deep 10 m at our study site if plants extract groundwater they needed extra energy to overcome gravitational potential to lift water therefore soil water uptake was more thermodynamically favorable during wet seasons and plants use shallow soil moisture preferentially in contrast during wet seasons soil layers and the layers near water table are all wet with relatively high water potential and hydraulic conductivity because groundwater is relatively deep 10 m at our study site if plants extract groundwater they needed extra energy to overcome gravitational potential to lift water therefore soil water uptake was more thermodynamically favorable during wet seasons and plants use shallow soil moisture preferentially although the top soil layer at 20 cm depth and groundwater 10 m at our study site do not have direct hydraulic connections the dynamics of root water uptake from these layers is still tightly linked this relationship helps to explain the phenomena found in the study of bleby et al 2010 that deep roots are tightly coordinated with shallow roots to supply plant water use and hr similar relationships were reported in the study of barbeta et al 2015 at the mediterranean prades holm oak forest in the iberian peninsula they found that when soil water content is less than 10 it coincides with the increase of groundwater uptake the critical point when plants switch from soil water uptake to groundwater uptake may be impacted by many factors such as climate conditions soil water characteristics water table depth soil thickness plant vulnerability to drought root density and root hydraulic conductivity we tested the impacts of soil types on the critical point the cases with two soil types a finer texture of silt loam and a coarser texture of loamy sand were compared to the baseline simulation in the previous analysis the soil water retention curves of three soil types and the critical points were shown in fig 13 all critical points were close to the positions where the slopes of the curves change dramatically indicating that a small decline in soil water content would cause significant decreases in water potential and hydraulic conductivity the critical point in the case of loamy sand corresponded to the point with the lowest soil water content and the highest soil water potential the coarse soil does not retain much water in the soil layer in this case plants would switch to use groundwater at the early stage when soil water potential was high while less soil water was available we postulate that plants use groundwater earlier as the climate becomes drier soil texture coarser water table shallower and soils were shallower vegetation with lower resistance to xylem cavitation higher root fractions accessing groundwater and higher hydraulic conductivity of the tap root will also switch to groundwater use at higher soil moisture contents further measurements and model simulations are needed to explore these hypotheses of plant water source shift 6 conclusions we integrated new functions for modeling the dynamics of groundwater dependent vegetation gou and miller 2014 into a spatially distributed groundwater land surface model parflow clm maxwell and miller 2005 to improve its performance in simulating plant root water uptake hydraulic redistribution and plant water stress the modified model was tested at a mediterranean oak savanna site and performed well capturing the daily hourly and spatial water and energy patterns in 8 year model simulations comparing the results from the original parflow clm model the compensation model and the modified model three models had similar performance in the wet season but yielded substantially different results for deep rooted vegetation in the dry season the modified model had several key advantages for simulating groundwater land surface atmosphere interactions which allowed for a number of insights into the water use behaviors of groundwater dependent vegetation the new root water uptake function used in the model allowed it to capture the seasonal shift in the depth at which plants extract water from the subsurface the model revealed that groundwater contributed to tree transpiration later in the dry season when soil water was depleted consistent with the analysis from diurnal water table fluctuation data this suggests that the relative influence of soil moisture and groundwater on the atmosphere changes dramatically over the course of a growing season this shift of plant water sources has been widely observed but it is currently ignored in most land surface models the root water uptake function in the original model extracted water from different layers simultaneously potentially leading to biases in modeling of land surface atmosphere interactions and climate prediction especially in long term simulations the compensation model simulated the shift in plant water source but it overestimated the groundwater use during the dry seasons in addition the new root water uptake function simultaneously simulated hr which had been widely found in many species the new function predicted both hydraulic lift and hydraulic descent during plant active and dormant seasons the new plant water stress function was based on the linear relationship between the changes of stomatal conductance and the changes of hydraulic conductance in roots it was capable of capturing the latent heat dynamics and proved to be valuable for simulating groundwater dependent vegetation whose root systems span various moisture conditions instead of using the parameters of wilting point and stress point the new function considers species specific vulnerable curves in its calculation which allowed the model to be applied in assessing vegetation vulnerability to drought for specific plants the modified model predicted leaf water potential and xylem cavitation which had advantages in the simulation of plants in arid and semiarid areas where the plants may suffer periodic water stress and cavitation the model results of predawn leaf water potential dropped to as low as 6 mpa during dry seasons indicating that the oaks suffered severe water stress even when they were using reliable groundwater and hydraulic lift occurred however the results of root cavitation revealed that groundwater uptake was still critical for plants to prevent hydraulic failure in shallow roots during dry seasons if groundwater uptake was cut off the loss of hydraulic conductance in shallow roots would likely near 100 in mid july or august in addition our simulations indicated a critical point when plants switched from soil water dependence to groundwater dependence this critical soil water content value coincided with large changes in the slope of the soil water retention curve when surface soil water content dropped below the critical point soil water potential and soil hydraulic conductivity decreased dramatically and a small amount of soil water uptake was needed to overcome a large amount of negative potential and resistance at this point groundwater uptake became thermodynamically more favorable than soil water uptake this critical point was tightly related to the hydraulic characteristics of both soil and plants climate condition water table depth and soil thickness overall this study highlighted the impacts of groundwater dependent vegetation on groundwater land surface atmosphere interactions the model tool presented in this paper captured several important ecohydrological processes which were not available in many hydrological and land surface models these modeling efforts can help improve our fundamental understanding of plant water use patterns and their effects on large scale water and energy balances acknowledgments the authors

756,several new functions representing groundwater dependent vegetation were incorporated into a coupled subsurface land surface model parflow clm in order to adequately describe groundwater water uptake hydraulic redistribution and plant water stress the modified model was used to conduct three dimensional stand scale simulations of a mediterranean oak savanna in california it performed well and captured daily hourly and spatial water and energy dynamics as well as groundwater evapotranspiration rates the new model was then compared to various approaches the original parflow clm and a version using a root water uptake compensation equation during the dry season the modified model closely predicted the measured transpiration rate while the original model predicted that it would become zero and the compensation approach overestimated it by nearly double the modified model also allowed for analysis of several key ecohydrological processes namely the hydraulic redistribution when plants were both active and dormant the leaf water potential and xylem cavitation keywords groundwater dependent vegetation upland phreatophyte hydraulic redistribution groundwater modeling land surface modeling groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum 1 introduction groundwater dynamics significantly influence land surface processes such as evapotranspiration et infiltration runoff and groundwater recharge which further impact the atmospheric boundary layer these groundwater land surface atmosphere interactions have been addressed in a number of previous modeling studies aimed at incorporating water table dynamics into climate hydrological and land surface models chen and hu 2004 clark et al 2015 fan et al 2007 gulden et al 2007 liang et al 2003 maxwell and condon 2016 maxwell et al 2011 maxwell and miller 2005 niu et al 2007 yeh and eltahir 2005 york et al 2002 previous modeling studies have focused mainly on the impacts of shallow water tables on water and energy fluxes at the land surface these modeling efforts examined how shallow groundwater directly interacts with unsaturated zone leading to higher soil moisture and increased et chen and hu 2004 condon et al 2013 fan and miguez macho 2010 fan et al 2007 ferguson and maxwell 2010 kollet and maxwell 2008 liang et al 2003 luo et al 2013 maxwell et al 2007 maxwell and kollet 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012b niu et al 2007 rihani et al 2010 york et al 2002 these enhanced models can improve the simulation of precipitation in some regions anyah et al 2008 jiang et al 2009 and capture the changes of surface runoff and stream flow rates gusev and nasonova 2002 gutowski et al 2002 miguez macho and fan 2012a yeh and eltahir 2005 the existence of groundwater dependent vegetation can significantly influence groundwater land surface atmosphere connections maxwell et al 2007 groundwater dependent vegetation frequently occurs in lowland areas along streams around springs and within groundwater fed wetlands eamus and froend 2006 eamus et al 2006 orellana et al 2012 however upland plants namely those belonging deep rooted phreatophytic species can link relatively deep groundwater dynamics 10 m with the land surface atmosphere system bleby et al 2010 canadell et al 1996 lewis and burgy 1964 these phreatophytes can alter the groundwater land surface atmosphere connection via two mechanisms root water uptake and hydraulic redistribution hr groundwater dynamics directly link to et through groundwater uptake to support transpiration while hr indirectly impacts the groundwater land surface atmosphere interaction by redistributing soil water and groundwater throughout the soil plant atmosphere continuum dawson 1993 dawson 1996 hultine et al 2003 ludwig et al 2003 orellana et al 2012 plant root water uptake can shift between shallow and deep water sources on both seasonal and daily time scales this phenomenon has been widely observed in many species especially those with dimorphic root systems and those in water limited environments barbeta et al 2015 bleby et al 2010 dawson and pate 1996 ehleringer and dawson 1992 grossiord et al 2017 meinzer et al 1999 meinzer et al 2001 rose et al 2003 voltas et al 2015 white et al 1985 at daily scales sap flow measurements and stable isotope data indicate that plants respond to changes in soil water availability very rapidly altering the zone from which they are withdrawing water bleby et al 2010 ehleringer and dawson 1992 hultine et al 2004 scott et al 2008 on seasonal time scales plants exploit deeper sources of soil water or groundwater as the upper soil layers dewater naumburg et al 2005 if the soil is recharged after a large rainfall event plants can respond quickly markedly increasing water uptake from upper layers these shifts between deep and shallow uptake suggest that the linkages between et and soil moisture at different depths varies daily and seasonally which can significantly impact the climate when acting over a landscape scale koster and suarez 2001 maxwell and condon 2016 a number of models have addressed the impacts of groundwater dependent vegetation by incorporating the processes of groundwater uptake and hydraulic redistribution some models simulated groundwater uptake by simply using the computed transpiration multiplied by the root fraction accessing groundwater which fails to capture the shift between soil water and groundwater maxwell et al 2007 other models used the compensation method for root water uptake simulation which increases water uptake from deep soil layers and groundwater uptake when shallow soil layers were dry jarvis 2011 simunek and hopmans 2009 javaux et al 2013 ferguson et al 2016 however some compensation methods may lead to overestimation of groundwater uptake without considering that the plants may experience water stress even when they are using groundwater ferguson et al 2016 some compensation approaches may consider such water stress and reduce transpiration by multiplying potential transpiration by the root fraction reaching groundwater but these approaches result to the simultaneous water uptake from soil water and groundwater when both of they are abundant in wet season therefore these approaches fail to capture the seasonal shift of plant water sources oleson et al 2013 as reviewed by neumann and cardon 2012 a number of models of hydraulic redistribution phenomenon have been developed e g siqueira et al 2008 teodosio et al 2017 yu and d odorico 2015 although testing these models against field data e g ryel et al 2002 zheng and wang 2007 is relatively uncommon while a few have been incorporated in land surface models such as clm e g lee et al 2005 wang 2011 wang et al 2011 none of the large scale earth system frameworks routinely incorporates them in addition hydraulic redistribution can occur in senesced and dormant plants hultine et al 2004 leffler et al 2005 but few models depict this phenomenon to address the influence of groundwater dependent vegetation on subsurface land atmosphere interactions the authors previously developed a plant scale model to simulate root water uptake hydraulic redistribution hr and water stress in phreatophytic vegetation gou and miller 2014 the physically based model performed well when simulating water and energy transfer along the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum gspac the root water uptake function proposed in the model is driven by potential gradients along the gspac which allows it to simulate both root water uptake and hr simultaneously in addition a new water stress function in the plant scale model was introduced which was based on a linear relationship between stomatal conductance and root conductance the results of the new model highlighted the seasonal and daily shift in plant water sources however this plant scale model did not address the impacts of these interactions in a wider context the objective of this study was to develop validate and apply a modeling tool capable of determining the influence of plants on the temporal and spatial interactions among groundwater and land surface processes at stand to landscape scales we incorporated the functions developed by gou and miller 2014 into a distributed groundwater land surface model parflow clm jones and woodward 2001 kollet and maxwell 2006 kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 these advancements allowed the modified model to explicitly describe plant groundwater use and hr by a range of plant species which influence both surface and subsurface water flow and alter the water and energy balances at the land surface the model advancements and limitations were discussed by comparing three model versions including our modified parflow clm model the original parflow clm model and the root water uptake compensation method introduced into parflow clm by ferguson et al 2016 we tested its performance when simulating spatial and temporal energy and water dynamics in a real world setting long term simulations of a mediterranean savanna system in california were conducted using the modified model to determine 1 how the timing and amounts of soil water uptake and groundwater uptake varied seasonally at the site and 2 when and why the groundwater dependent vegetation shifted from soil water dependence to groundwater dependence 2 modification of parflow clm 2 1 plant scale formulations of water use by phreatophytic vegetation in the formulations by gou and miller gou and miller 2014 both root water uptake and hr are driven by the water potential gradients along gspac water may flow into or out of roots depending on the direction of water potential gradient between roots and surrounding soils the net water uptake from all layers equals transpiration assuming that the plant water storage does not change a reference point is defined in the model which refers to the junction point between the root system and stem located at the same elevation of the ground surface for a single root the process of water absorption is depicted as 1 q r o o t 2 π l k s o i l ψ s o i l ψ s o i l ψ r o o t ln b r where qroot is the root water uptake rate l3t 1 ψsoil is the soil water potential l ψroot is the root water potential l ksoil ψsoil is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil lt 1 we assume that all roots are first order roots that directly connect to the reference point in a parallel circuit configuration each root is considered to have a transporting part and an absorbing part which is a short absorbing zone behind the root tip b is the distance from the edge of the rhizosphere zone to the axis of the root l l is the length of the absorbing root portion l and r is the root diameter l therefore the surface area of the absorbing root portion of a single root is 2πrl gou and miller 2014 all roots are assumed to have the same surface area of the absorbing portion the root water storage is assumed to be negligible the absorbed water is continuously moved through the transporting root to the reference point 2 q r o o t π r 2 k r o o t ψ r o o t ψ r o o t ψ r e f z 0 5 l l z where kroot ψroot is the hydraulic conductivity of the absorbing and transporting root portions lt 1 ψref is the potential at the reference point l l is the horizontal length of the transporting root portion l and z is the

which is the ratio of the number of roots within the ith layer to the total number of roots at a root is the total area of the absorbing root surface of the whole plant l2 froot i at a root represents the total area of the absorbing root surface within the ith layer the xylem potential at the reference point ψref is further used to estimate the changes of water potential within the above ground plant portions by accounting for the energy consumed overcoming gravitational potential and the frictional resistance to water flow along the pathway from the reference point to leaves the resistance of water flowing from surrounding soil into roots and vice versa is denoted as γs i tl 1 l whereas γr i refers to the resistance to transport water from the root tip to the reference point tl 1 l the equations for γs i and γr i and their derivations can be found in gou and miller 2014 soil and plant hydraulic conductivities vary depending on soil and plant water potential status and such relationships were described by van genuchten curves and species specific vulnerability curves sperry et al 1988 sperry and tyree 1988 tyree and sperry 1989 respectively when ψsoil i ψref zi 0 the potential gradient drives the water uptake from surrounding soil into roots in the ith layer while when ψsoil i ψref zi 0 the negative potential gradient implies that water is released from roots to surrounding soils therefore eq 3 estimates both root water uptake and hydraulic redistribution rates simultaneously the plant water storage is assumed to be negligible therefore the total net water uptake from all layers equals to the transpiration of the whole plant 4 t a t a r o o t a l e a f i 1 m f r o o t i ψ s o i l i ψ r e f z i γ s i γ r i where t is the plant transpiration rate per unit

root hydraulic conductivity domec et al 2006 was used to simulate plant water stress the loss of hydraulic conductivity in the whole root system is calculated using the equation gou and miller 2014 5

species specific experimentally measured vulnerability curve matzner et al 2001 venturas et al 2017 in this study we used the linear relationship between stomatal conductance and root conductance as the plant water stress function rather than the relationship between stomata and whole plant conductance used in some literature sperry et al 2003 roots are generally more vulnerable to cavitation than the trunks and branches sperry and ikeda 1997 choat et al 2005 domec et al 2009 johnson et al 2016 which implies that roots are likely to be a critical hydraulic bottleneck in whole plant water transport when water is limited as the soil dries root conductance declines fast and becomes the dominant regulator of whole plant conductance steudle 2000 domec et al 2004 domec et al 2009 the measurements indicated that maximum daily stomatal conductance declined linearly with increasing afternoon loss of root conductivity over the course of the dry season domec et al 2006 during the drought the stomatal conductance may decline with the root xylem embolism the adjustment of stomata conductance could avoid hydraulic failure in roots based on our modifications the stomatal conductance was calculated in clm as a linear function of ξ which further reduced transpiration when water was limited 2 2 original parflow clm parflow clm was developed by coupling the parallel integrated hydrology model parflow and the land surface model clm jefferson et al 2017 kollet and maxwell 2006 kollet and maxwell 2008 maxwell and miller 2005 with clm incorporated into parflow as a module each soil column in parflow has one corresponding clm cell to calculate the water and energy fluxes at the land surface for its specific land cover type kollet and maxwell 2008 the surface and subsurface hydrology formulations in clm are replaced by parflow which simulates variably saturated soil water groundwater movements and overland flow the two models communicate with each other over the root zone at every time step parflow passes information on soil moisture and depth to groundwater to clm clm then factors this subsurface information into its calculation of infiltration transpiration and root water uptake the infiltration and root water uptake rates are then passed back to parflow where they are treated as sinks sources in the richards equation as a result the coupled parflow clm can describe how hydrological and ecological processes are related to the vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of vegetation topography and hydrogeology atchley and maxwell 2011 condon and maxwell 2014 ferguson and maxwell 2010 kollet and maxwell 2008 mikkelson et al 2013 rihani et al 2010 2 3 incorporating phreatophyte functions into original parflow clm in order to properly represent phreatophytes in parflow clm we replaced its original functions with those described in section 2 1 in parflow clm s original root uptake function the total transpiration was distributed over layers within root zone according to the root fraction in each layer dai et al 2003 this approach suggests that plants extracted water simultaneously from each layer at the same water uptake rate per unit root fraction in the original function in the new function eqs 1 3 root water uptake from each layer is controlled by the individual layer s water potential the root water potential and the soil root resistance incorporating the new function allowed the model to simulate root water uptake using a more physically based approach also allowing it to capture both hydraulic lift and hydraulic descent when plant was active and dormant furthermore the new root water uptake function could capture seasonal and daily shifts in plant water sources these shifts are a critical phenomenon in groundwater dependent vegetation since phreatophytes may switch to use groundwater to buffer the impacts of drought when soil water is depleted in the new root water uptake function the shift in plant water sources automatically occurred driven by the potential differences the groundwater uptake was also limited by the changes of resistance along gspac second the original plant water stress function in parflow clm dai et al 2003 was replaced with eq 5 the original function in parflow clm was based on the commonly used feddes equation which describes plant water stress as a piecewise function of matric potential which predicts a linear reduction in evapotranspiration when matric potential decreases from the stress point to the wilting point feddes et al 1978 federer 1979 feddes et al 2001 as it is typically implemented in land surface models like clm this formulation has several drawbacks in simulating the dynamics of groundwater dependent vegetation javaux et al 2013 argued that the formulation can only consider the impacts of plant hydraulic architecture through effective parameterization and fails to account for the changes of root resistances it also neglects the influence of root activity on plant water stress making it unable to simulate water stress in deep rooted plants where the root systems expand across layers with highly varying water content in such situations some roots in wetter layers may be more active with lower cavitation while other roots in drier layers maybe less active in addition the transpiration was set to zero in the original water stress function when the soil water content of the top soil layer dropped below the wilting point which could occur due to soil evaporation this assumption incorrectly suggested that plants stop transpiration when the shallow soil water reservoir are depleted instead of exploiting deeper soil water and groundwater thus this function was not suitable for the simulation of deep rooted plants during droughts the new function integrated the influence of various soil water contents groundwater and root activity on plant water stress after making the replacement the stomatal conductance calculated by parflow clm was linearly limited by the plant water stress ξ in eq 5 rather than the aggregate soil water availability the wilting point and stress point were not needed in the new water stress function instead the species specific xylem vulnerability curves were required finally a new vegetation functional type winter grass was added into the model for application to our study site the original parflow clm model contained only one grass type which is active based on the soil temperature dai et al 2003 the green up and senescence of the new winter grass type were controlled by the soil moisture in the top soil layer representing the behavior of the dominant grass species on site in the modified parflow clm only the old functions in clm were replaced by our new functions e g root water uptake and hydraulic redistribution functions plant water stress function and winter grass phenology function all functions in parflow remain the same therefore these new functions could be incorporated into other land surface models as well such as the stand alone version of clm in the community earth system model cesm in the modified model the root hydraulic conductivity k root i ψ root i declines as the root water potential ψ root i decreases making ψ root i a critical variable in the calculations of plant water uptake release rate and transpiration however the root water potential ψ root i is also related to the plant water uptake release rate and transpiration therefore the modified model was solved iteratively at the beginning of simulation the initial water potential for each layer was set in parflow the initial condition of root water potential ψ root i was set equal to the soil water potential nearby the initial condition of root water potential ψ root i was used to calculate the loss of root hydraulic conductance and the plant water stress function ξ in eq 5 to give the value of transpiration t the transpiration value t was then used in eq 4 to solve for the water potential at the reference point ψ ref which further gave the results of root water uptake from a certain soil layer qi in eq 3 according to how much water was absorbed from the specific layer into the roots or released from roots to the layer q the soil water potential ψsoil the root water potential ψroot was calculated in eq 1 therefore the initial root water potential ψroot value was updated the same procedure was repeated using the updated root water potential until the model converged 3 model application 3 1 study site we tested the modified model against measurements from a savanna ecosystem in order to gauge its performance when predicting storage and fluxes of water and energy the tonzi ranch a blue oak savanna in the lower foothills of the western sierra nevada in california latitude 38 4311 n longitude 120 966 w was selected as a case study site baldocchi 2017 its mediterranean climate leads to wet mild winters and dry hot summers baldocchi et al 2004 chen et al 2008b ma et al 2007 the mean annual precipitation is approximately 560 mm most of which occurs between october and may wet season chen et al 2008b miller et al 2010 determined that deciduous blue oaks quercus douglasii the dominant woody vegetation type at this site are obligate phreatophytes and that plant groundwater use supports most transpiration during dry seasons the phenology of blue oaks is tightly related to temperature leaf out occurs at the end of march and senescence around the beginning of october in contrast the grasses at the site are annual species and only rely on soil water ma et al 2007 their green up typically occurs in november when the wet season begins and they senesce in may of the next year when the soil becomes dry ma et al 2007 the site has shallow rocky silt loam soils that are approximately 60 100 cm deep and are underlain by a 4 8 m saprolite zone followed by fractured metamorphic bedrock the water table depth ranges from 7 12 m across the site miller et al 2010 depending on the season and the ground surface elevation a suite of micrometeorological and hydrological measurements have been collected at the site since 2001 two eddy covariance towers one in the overstory 23 m height above tree canopy and one in the understory 2 m height under tree canopy measure fluxes of co2 water vapor and sensible heat using the eddy covariance method miller et al 2010 continuous soil moisture measurements have been collected at half hourly intervals using a total of three theta probes delta t devices model ml2 x cambridge united kingdom located under the canopy at depths of 5 10 and 20 cm soil heat flux was measured using three replicate plates all at a 3 cm depth hfp01sc hukseflux delft the netherlands in addition time domain reflectometry probes moisture point model 917 environmental sensors inc victoria british columbia were installed at nine locations five under tree canopy and four in the open spaces at depths of 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 45 cm and 45 60 cm to measure soil moisture weekly or every two weeks chen et al 2008b midday and predawn leaf water potentials of blue oak leaves sampled at a height of 2 3 m were measured at two week intervals in the oak active season miller et al 2010 osuna 2011 three observation wells were drilled to manually measure water table depth at two week intervals since may 2007 depth to groundwater has been automatically recorded at half hourly intervals in one well using a vented pressure transducer wl400 global water sacramento california miller et al 2010 other variables such as leaf area index stomatal conductance and plant height have been periodically monitored baldocchi 2017 3 2 model setup the model domain consisted of a 200 m 200 m surface area and extended to a depth of 15 m previous lidar images showed 43 coverage by deciduous blue oak 52 by annual grass and 5 by evergreen grey pine fig 1 chen et al 2008a the model domain was discretized into 100 100 28 cells with a lateral resolution of 2 m δx δy 2 m and variable vertical resolutions δz ranging from δz 0 2 m for soil layers and layers within the range of water table fluctuations to δz 0 8 m for saprolite layers the soil thickness ranged from 60 cm to 100 cm four lateral boundaries were defined as monthly variable constant head boundary conditions based on groundwater depth measurements from three nearby wells the bottom of the computational domain was set as a no flow boundary vegetation distribution and land surface elevation ranging from 166 m to 170 m were obtained from the lidar imagery chen et al 2008a in the model simulation only the blue oaks were considered to be phreatophytes with their tap roots reaching the groundwater table while the grasses and pines solely relied on soil water with their shallow roots terminating above the soil saprolite interface only one vegetation cover type was assigned to each surface model cell neglecting grasses occurring under the tree canopy a simplification necessary for using clm four soil types were used to represent the top soil layer the middle and deeper soil layers the saprolite layer and the bedrock layers the van genuchten parameters of these four soil types were based on previously obtained site data miller 2009 gou and miller 2014 most parameter values for blue oaks were the same as the ones used in gou and miller 2014 therefore no further calibrations were conducted only the parameters of root distribution were different from the ones in gou and miller 2014 here we specified 45 of roots in 0 20 cm soil layer the top soil layer 30 of roots in 20 40 cm soil layer the middle soil layer 15 of roots in the soil layers ranging from 40 to 100 cm depth the deep soil layers based on the dimorphic nature of oak rooting patterns and a lack of appropriate measurements we assumed that 10 of roots were present in the saprolite layer but future model revisions could easily incorporate actual root distribution if new data becomes available the xylem vulnerability curve of blue oaks used in this model was modified based on the root xylem vulnerability curve of oaks measured by matzner et al 2001 see gou and miller 2014 the modified model only considered drought induced root cavitation while frost induced root cavitation was not included this simplification was reasonable for the application at tonzi site where the soil temperature remained above 0 c 3 3 simulation setup first the modified parflow clm model was used to conduct three dimensional stand scale simulations and the model results were compared to field data conditions at the site were simulated for 8 years years 2002 2009 with a half hourly time step the modified model was forced with incoming radiation wind speed and direction surface air temperature precipitation atmospheric pressure and relative humidity measured at the study site the model performance was tested by comparing the model results and measurements at daily and hourly temporal scales and at multiple spatial locations 1 the half hourly model results averaged over the whole domain were summarized into daily results to compare against the 8 year measurements of overstory et understory et point measurements of soil moisture at different depths and available predawn leaf water potential data 2 the half hourly model results for latent heat again averaged over the whole domain were compared against the half hourly measurements from 23 m overstory eddy covariance tower to test if the model captured diurnal changes of latent heat in different seasons and years for both analyses we assumed that the energy and water fluxes from the domain 200 m 200 m 15 m were representative of the fluxes from the footprints of both overstory and understory eddy covariance towers the overstory tower located at a height of 23 m measured the fluxes from soil grasses and trees within the domain while the understory tower at a height of 2 m captured the fluxes from soil and grasses within the domain 3 the model simulation from year 2004 drier year and 2005 wetter year were chosen to analyze the spatial patterns of soil moisture dynamics under different vegetation covers as measured by the spatially distributed tdr probes second the modified parflow clm version was compared to two other parflow clm versions these model versions were used to conduct simulations at the same study area with the same model parameterization used in the modified model in order to test the model performances especially in simulating phreatophytic water use one version was the original parflow clm in the original model the root water uptake was treated as simultaneous water uptake from different layers according to root fraction without explicit consideration of the water availability in each layer when the top soil layer at the land surface dropped below the wilting point the transpiration was shut off to eliminate root water uptake from the dry top soil layer the plant stress function in the original parflow clm model was the commonly used feddes function which required the parameters of wilting points i e 3 mpa for the blue oaks and pines and 1 2 mpa for the winter grass in the simulation another version was based on the root water uptake function proposed by ferguson et al 2016 ferguson et al 2016 introduced a rescaled approach into parflow clm model which maintained transpiration until all layers in root zone fell below wilting point this approach rescaled the root fraction over layers above wilting point using the equation ferguson et al 2016 6 f r o o t i f r o o t i δ ψ i ψ w i l t i 1 n f r o o t i δ ψ i ψ w i l t where f root i is the rescaled root fraction within the ith layer δ ψ i ψ wilt is equal to 1 if ψi ψwilt or 0 if ψi ψwilt therefore the plant would continue to take water from the deep layers with available water during the dry seasons the root fraction was renormalized over the remaining layers above the wilting point the root fraction was set to zero when all layers were below the wilting point it was a root water uptake compensation method we referred this model version as compensation version the plant stress function was the same as the one used in the original parflow clm version third once confirming the modified model s ability to reproduce key ecohydrologic variables we further used the modified model to conduct scenario test to analyze the impacts of plant groundwater use the groundwater uptake of blue oaks was turned off by altering the root distribution so that the deep roots were not present and the root zone was constrained within soil layers this scenario was constructed to analyze the xylem cavitation with without groundwater uptake in order to explore how blue oaks used groundwater to avoid drought induced hydraulic failure 4 results 4 1 modified model results and measurements comparison daily time scale micrometeorological conditions at the site were typical given its mediterranean climate fig 2 during the 2002 2009 interval years 2004 and 2008 were the driest with an average annual precipitation of 440 mm while years 2005 and 2006 were the wettest with an average annual precipitation of 750 mm net radiation rn measured 23 m above the ground averaged 3 15 gj m2 year the energy balance was computed based on the latent heat le sensible heat h and soil heat g flux measurements fig 2 neglecting storage in the canopy air space and biomass as per wilson et al 2002 the comparison between measured rn and measured le h g implied that significant energy imbalance occurred during all winters and during the springs and summers of wet years the absolute value of rn le h g rn was over 30 for a total of 24 of days while this site provided reliable data with high degree of energy balance closure baldocchi et al 2004 wilson et al 2002 the issue was still important as it can significantly influence model calibration and validation foken 2008 the total evapotranspiration ettotal was measured using the 23 m overstory eddy covariance tower which captured the stand scale fluxes fig 3 initially the modeled and measured results showed a positive correlation with r2 0 72 fig 3 bottom left however the modified model failed to match the measured ettotal during all winter periods when significant energy imbalance occurred fig 2 significant energy imbalance in early spring during 2005 and 2006 fig 2 also corresponded with clear mismatches between modeled and measured ettotal at the same time fig 3 when days with poor closure i e daily rn le h g rn 30 were removed from consideration the agreement between the modeled and measured et data improved substantially with r2 0 85 fig 3 bottom right additionally the model simulated dew deposition and generated negative values in et during the winter months the measured understory et etunder fig 4 was estimated from the measurements from the 2 m understory eddy covariance tower which captured the fluxes from grasses and soil the measured etunder was compared to the modeled etunder averaged from et of grass covered areas and the soil evaporation under the tree canopy over the entire model domain fig 4 again after removing the results for the days with poor energy budget closure measurements the correlation between modeled and measured data was improved from r2 0 43 fig 4 bottom left to 0 66 fig 4 bottom right however etunder was still underestimated by around 30 likely due to the model s exclusion of the grasses under the tree canopy in the modified model the moisture control phenology of winter grass required the critical soil water potential to control grass green up and senescence the critical soil water potential for winter grass was set to 1 2 mpa making it active in the winter when soil water potential in the top 20 cm depth of soil exceeded 1 2 mpa and senescent when soil water potential at the top soil layer dropped below 1 2 mpa this relationship helped to capture the changes of etunder fig 4 with soil moisture fig 5 especially the fast decrease in etunder after the rainy season ceased according to this relationship the modeled average grass green up date was the 317th day of year and the modeled average grass senescence date was the 148th day of year these results compared well with ma et al s 2007 observations for years 2000 2006 which showed grass green up dates between days 314 and 362 and senescence dates between days 129 and 162 the new formulation in the modified model allowed for the simulation of leaf water potential changes for every time step which can be used to explore water stress in plants leaf water potential measurements for blue oaks were available during the growing seasons of years 2002 2003 and 2007 osuna 2011 the model generally matched the trends of the measured predawn and midday leaf water potential fig 5 for each year the predawn water potential was high approximately 0 2 mpa during the wet seasons when soil water potential was high it decreased dramatically following the rapid decrease of soil water potential from may to june during dry months from june to september the predawn leaf water potential dropped to between 4 and 6 mpa when rains commenced during september and october the predawn leaf water potential quickly rebounded reaching approximately 0 2 mpa the midday leaf water potential also remained high during the wet season declined dramatically from may to june and rebounded after the winter rainfall the difference between the predawn and midday water potential was relatively small during the wet and transitional seasons while the difference became more significant during the dry seasons the results indicated that leaf water potential responded to the soil water potential dynamics quickly for the inter annual changes the predawn and midday leaf water potentials during dry seasons were lower in dry years year 2004 and 2008 we chose the modeled soil moisture results at the location where the soil moisture sensors were installed to compare against measurements at different depths fig 5 the model generally matched the measurements however from may to august the model results exhibited more rapid soil drying than the observations soil evaporation tends to be overestimated in clm lawrence et al 2007 our results suggest this is likely the case as well in our model a rapid decrease of soil moisture at the beginning of dry season in may led to a mismatch with the measurements which showed a more gradual decrease during dry season fig 5 in addition the permeability in the fractured saprolite zone was highly uncertain which also may have affected the model s accuracy in the upper soil zones by altering drainage rates 4 2 modified model results and measurements comparison diurnal time scale we further examined the modified model performance in simulating the diurnal changes of latent heat we chose the results from four biophysically representative time periods fig 6 the wet season during winter when the oaks were dormant and the grasses were active labeled wet january the wet season during spring wet april the transitional period between wet and dry seasons when both the oaks and grasses were active transitional may and the dry season during summer when the oaks were active and the grasses were senescent dry august during each season we calculated the half hourly average le over a five day period only consecutive days with a high degree of observed energy budget closure were used the modeled latent heat generally followed the diurnal patterns found in the measured results albeit with some notable exceptions the modeled values tended to be lower during nighttime especially during the winter wet season i e january in fig 6 one possible cause the model can simulate dew while the measurements from eddy covariance tower did not capture dew during the night this phenomenon became more obvious in winter nights when temperature was low both overestimations e g may 2005 and 2009 and underestimations e g may 2003 2007 and 2008 of midday latent heat occurred fig 6 these mismatches did not show any seasonal or annual biases and occurred in both wet and dry years we suspect one reason of these mismatches was that the model domain did not represent the footprint of the eddy covariance tower miller 2009 the footprint of 23 m overstory tower captures information up to 500 m from the tower ring 2014 way beyond the 200 m 200 m model domain the footprint of tower most frequently covers the lower left quadrant of the model domain miller 2009 since the spatial dimension of the flux footprint was not fixed and it changed with the atmospheric conditions wilson et al 2002 the modeled results from the fixed model domain may overestimate or underestimate the measured flux captured in the dynamic footprint 4 3 modified model results and measurements comparison spatial patterns we compared modeled soil moisture values at nine locations where tdrs were installed and plotted them against the values measured at 10 cm depth in year 2004 and 2005 fig 7 the modeled results from five points under oak canopies were averaged to compare to the averaged value from five tdrs measurements at the same locations the averaged modeled and measured soil moisture results from four points under grasses in the open spaces were also compared the modeled results generally captured the soil moisture changes under different vegetation covers during the dry seasons during the wet winter seasons the modeled soil moisture values under oak were slightly lower than the soil moisture under grasses the difference was more obvious in the measurements which may due to the effects of soil heterogeneity after major precipitation events ceased in may soil moisture decreased rapidly and the soil water content under oak and grass were differentiated due to unequal plant water uptake and soil evaporation rates the soil moisture beneath grasses decreased more slowly than the soil moisture under oaks did this pattern became more obvious when comparing the model results of spatial and seasonal changes in soil moisture at different depths fig 8 the differences in moisture of soils located under different species fig 1 could be easily distinguished fig 8 the monthly spatial variance of the soil moisture was calculated using the measurements from nine time domain reflectometry probes installed at different locations the variance of the modeled results only generally followed the variance of the measured data during the dry season but failed to match the variance of the measured data during the wet season fig 9 a in the model simulation individuals of the same species were assigned the same species specific parameters for example every oak tree had the same leaf area index and root distribution therefore the soil moisture results under the same species were very similar and only slightly altered by topographic factors in addition the soil type at the same depth was set to be homogenous in the model during the wet season the spatial variance of the measured soil moisture was more significant it may be due to the effects of soil heterogeneity and leaf area of each plant which impacted the canopy interception infiltration and soil water content the model ignored the heterogeneity of soil and leaf area index which led to more homogenous results with low variance during the wet seasons however during the dry season the soil moisture across the domain all approached to the very low level when the net radiation was high therefore the soil heterogeneity and leaf area index were not the dominant factors to impact the soil moisture variance during the dry seasons 4 4 three model version comparison we compared the results of blue oak transpiration soil moisture distribution and root water uptake from the original and modified parflow clm models when transpiration was predominately energy limited from march to may the transpiration results from two model versions were highly correlated fig 9 however significant differences occurred during dry seasons when transpiration became water limited in the original model when soil water content of the top soil layer dropped below the wilting point transpiration stopped abruptly in the compensation model the transpiration rate was maintained at rates near the potential et rates when the oak was using groundwater the results indicated that the oak did not experience severe water stress when accessing the constant water source from the saturated zone in the root water uptake compensation method the spatial variance in latent heat of three methods fig 9b also indicated that the compensation model showed great variance during the dry season because the groundwater dependent oaks maintained high transpiration rate while the other plants almost ceased transpiration in the modified model the transpiration also continued with the water support from deep soil and groundwater however the results from the modified model showed that the transpiration had significant decrease during the dry season which implied that the oaks still encountered severe water stress when accessing the reliable groundwater source the measurements of predawn leaf water potential during the dry season dropped to between 4 to 6 mpa fig 5 indicating that the plants experienced severe water stress with groundwater uptake only the modified model captured the transpiration dynamics fig 10 the soil moisture results of the top soil layer were similar from both models for the middle and deep soil layers the soil moisture results were similar during wet seasons but significantly different during dry seasons in the original model because the transpiration stopped during dry seasons the water uptake from the middle and deep soil layers also ceased as a result the soil water content of the middle and deep soil layers remained high in the original model in the compensation model and the modified model the simulated soil moisture results for all layers were similar in general the transpiration and soil moisture results from all three models were similar during wet seasons indicating that three models may have similar performance when they were applied in wet seasons regions the soil moisture results of the top soil layer were similar during both wet and dry seasons implying that all three models may yield similar results in the simulations of shallow rooted vegetation however the performance of three models was significantly different during dry seasons it indicated that three models had substantial difference in the simulations of dry seasons regions with deep rooted vegetation accessing groundwater we further analyzed the results of root water uptake from different layers in the model fig 11 in the original model the root water uptake from a specific layer was calculated using the computed transpiration multiplied by the root fraction in the layer ferguson et al 2016 therefore the modeled root water uptake from different layers occurred simultaneously and was proportional to the total transpiration fig 11 in the compensation model water stress was calculated according to the available moisture within the layers above the wilting point the computed transpiration was distributed over the layers with available moisture according to the rescaled root fraction therefore the ratio of root water uptake from different layers changed with the changes of available moisture and rescaled root fraction however because the root water uptake compensation method only considered the layers above wilting point in its water stress calculation it led to nearly no stress condition when soil layers were dry and the saturated layer became the only layer to support transpiration therefore fig 11 showed that the groundwater uptake increased significantly during the dry seasons the transpiration reached to the rates near the potential et by unlimited water uptake from groundwater it led to overestimation of plant groundwater use during the dry seasons in the modified model the root water uptake was determined by the potential gradients and the resistances along gspac thus the modeled water uptake from different sources varied daily and seasonally and showed the dynamics of hydraulic redistribution fig 11 during wet seasons the root water uptake from the top soil layer in the modified model was slightly higher than the results from the original and the compensation models because the modified model tended to take more soil water when it was adequate the top soil water uptake results from three models decreased abruptly at the same time when the top soil water reservoir was depleted during dry seasons the root water uptake from all sources stopped in the original model the root water uptake from groundwater maintained et at rates near the reference value in the compensation model simulations while the root water uptake continued at lower rates with severe water stress in the modified model the low groundwater uptake rate was mainly determined by the reduction of root conductance during the dry season in the modified model groundwater was absorbed by the tap root and transferred upwards energy was consumed in this process to overcome the resistance within the tap roots and the gravitational potential which led to the reduction of root water potential within tap roots the tap root conductivity decreased as the root water potential reduced which limited the tap root ability to absorb and transfer groundwater therefore the plants were not able to absorb and transfer groundwater at the maximum rate close to the potential et the plants experienced water stress even though they were accessing reliable groundwater in addition the root water uptake in the modified model showed the results of hydraulic redistribution the soil water uptake in the modified model was mainly positive during the daytime and negative during the nighttime while groundwater uptake was positive during the nighttime indicating the occurrence that groundwater was lifted and released to soil layers during dry seasons the modified model also shows that hydraulic descent usually occurred following the rainfall events during dry seasons during occasional rainfall events e g the rainfall events during dry season of 2003 and hydraulic descent was triggered the precipitation stored in the top soil layer was taken and transferred downward to recharge deeper layers when autumn rains commenced hydraulic descent occurred even when the oaks were dormant the magnitude of hydraulic descent decreased as the potential gradients among layers diminished 5 discussion 5 1 improvements in the modified model several new features were introduced in the modified model to improve its performance especially in simulating deep rooted vegetation in a water limited environment the modified model predicted leaf water potentials which were not included in most land surface models although they serve as critical indicators of plant water status the model results showed that the dynamics of predawn leaf water potential are linked to soil water potential during the wet season before may tightly coupled to groundwater depth and plant hydraulic structure during dry seasons and finally recover with autumn rainfalls similar dynamics of predawn leaf water potential was reported in other mediterranean oaks david et al 2007 during dry seasons the predawn leaf water potential dropped to between 4 and 6 mpa indicating the blue oaks suffered severe water stress even when they shifted to using groundwater groundwater uptake may not be able to meet the high evaporation demand during dry seasons because of the limitations of plant hydraulic structure e g limitation in xylem hydraulic conductance and cavitation in tap roots therefore the shift in water sources the utilization of groundwater and hr may all be necessary for oaks to buffer the effect of prolonged summer drought although these strategies are unable to fully alleviate plant water stress grossiord et al 2017 however accessing groundwater is still critical because it helps plants avoid drought induced hydraulic failure the unmodified model predicted 100 cavitation in the shallow roots in the top soil layer usually in the middle of july in the dry years or in the middle of august in the wet years even the modified model predicted that in the driest period of mid august the loss of conductance in the root system could reach 82 the model scenario test suggests that plant groundwater use prevented hydraulic failure of the shallow roots via two mechanisms 1 when groundwater was accessible plants switched to use groundwater instead of exploiting more soil water during droughts and 2 when groundwater served as the source of hydraulic lift to recharge shallow roots and surrounding soil both mechanisms prevented soil water potential and shallow root water potential to drop to extremely low values and avoid 100 cavitation in the shallow roots the original root water uptake function which extracts water from different layers simultaneously according to the root fraction is typical of those used in hydrologic and land surface models the function is computationally efficient but it does not consider the moisture availability and root activity within each layer thus it may result in continuous water uptake from extremely dry layers to cope with this issue the original function shuts off transpiration when top soil moisture falls below the wilting point it eliminates water uptake from the top dry soil layer during droughts and also prohibits water uptake from deeper layers where moisture is still available it also failed to capture the seasonal shift of plant water sources previous models used root water uptake compensation to account for heterogeneity in soil water availability e g hopmans and bristows 2002 jarvis 2011 simunek and hopmans 2009 javaux et al 2013 ferguson et al 2016 we compared our modified model with the compensation method introduced by ferguson et al 2016 which used a rescaled root fraction approach to redistribute the water uptake over the layers and maintain transpiration until all layers within the root zone fall below wilting point it was one root water uptake compensation method and allowed plants to exploit deep water sources during dry seasons however this approach resulted to unlimited water uptake from groundwater during the dry season since it assumed that the roots accessing groundwater are not water stressed it failed to match the dry season transpiration under severe water stress the new root water uptake function solves these problems considering the dynamics of potential gradients and resistances along the gspac the new function gradually diminishes water uptake from drying layers and increased water use from layers with available moisture it allows plants to use deep water sources when the top soil layer is dry and also captures the shift of plant water sources it is especially suitable for simulations in dry regions seasons with deep rooted vegetation and in places where hr is known to occur the function captured both hydraulic lift and hydraulic descent during plant active and dormant seasons which may have significant hydrological and ecological effects the original plant water stress function was one of the most commonly used functions in hydrologic and land surface models stomatal conductance was inversely related to a water stress factor which was a piecewise linear function of soil water content or soil water potential the water stress factor represents the aggregate moisture availability over the root zone and needed the parameters of stress point i e field capacity in original parflow clm and wilting point for its calculation the new plant water stress function is based on the relationship found in experimental studies showing that the stomatal conductance decreases linearly with the loss of root hydraulic conductance domec et al 2009 the loss of root hydraulic conductance is calculated according to the root water potential and the species specific vulnerability curve instead of assigning a wilting point the new function considers the plant vulnerability to drought in its water stress calculation therefore the new model is able to predict that the predawn leaf water potential of blue oaks during the prolonged drought dropped to around 6 mpa which is much lower than the wilting point value conventionally used in other models but it has been consistently measured at the site 5 2 implications of groundwater uptake we first analyzed the evidence of groundwater uptake from the measured data at our study site miller et al 2010 found that the blue oaks at this site switched to take more water from saturated zone when soil water was depleted in dry seasons we followed the white loheide method loheide et al 2005 white 1932 reported in the study of miller et al 2010 using diurnal water table fluctuation data to estimate groundwater consumption by the blue oaks at this site the diurnal water table fluctuation method isolated the daily change in groundwater driven by plant groundwater uptake from the overall seasonal trends in the water table level miller et al 2010 continuous groundwater measurements with half hourly time interval were collected at the tonzi site since may 2007 the daily groundwater uptake rate was estimated from may 2007 to december 2009 except two major measurement gaps from january 2008 to march 2008 and from august 2008 to september 2008 fig 12 considerable uncertainty and errors in this estimation may be attributed to the measurements the assumptions the parameter value selection and the method itself see discussions in miller et al 2010 this method shows that groundwater uptake starts increasing in may when soil moisture is decreasing and reached the maximum rate around june when net radiation was the highest however the total et measured from the overstory eddy covariance tower began decreasing in may this indicates that at the beginning of dry season in may soil water uptake decreases rapidly and plants switch from soil water dependence to groundwater dependence compared to the wetter year 2009 the estimated groundwater uptake in the drier year 2008 increased earlier and had a greater contribution to the total et this indicates that the time and duration of groundwater uptake is tightly related to precipitation consistent with bleby et al s 2010 findings our modified model generally matches the trend of increasing and decreasing in groundwater uptake from may to september and captures the seasonal shift in plant water sources the modeled groundwater uptake and the estimated values from the groundwater fluctuation data from may 2007 to december 2009 show good agreement fig 12 because only the blue oaks are considered to reach groundwater in the model simulation the modeled groundwater uptake drops to nearly zero when blue oak canopy was dormant from mid october to mid march next year however the estimated groundwater uptake continues to occur at a low rate after the blue oaks senesced which may be due to groundwater usage by the evergreen grey pines at this site or may due to bole evaporation by blue oaks therefore the modeled groundwater uptake results are slightly lower than the estimated values from water table fluctuation the modeled groundwater uptake in the 8 year simulation shows that the groundwater uptake by blue oaks supports most dry season et while soil water supports most wet season et at the site during the dry seasons over 60 of total et during june july august and september came from groundwater uptake the highest groundwater contribution to dry season total et occurred in year 2008 72 and the lowest happened in year 2005 36 this finding implies that groundwater acts as a buffer during dry years but soil water is used preferentially during wet years 5 3 shift in water sources the model simulation allowed us to find the critical soil moisture point at which plants switch from soil water dependence to groundwater dependence for example the time when groundwater uptake started increasing i e groundwater uptake started to exceed 10 of total plant water uptake corresponds to the time when the volumetric soil water content of top soil layer dropped to around 0 10 m3 m3 fig 12 this point can then be related to the van genuchten curves used in the model simulation for the top 20 cm soil layer fig 13 baseline the slope of the curve changes dramatically when soil water content approaches the critical soil water content value 0 10 m3 m3 corresponding to a soil water potential of 0 26 mpa green dot on the baseline in fig 13 this implies that when soil moisture dropped below the threshold of 0 10 m3 m3 a slight decrease in soil water content would lead to dramatic decreases in soil water potential and soil hydraulic conductivity in that situation if plants extract a small amount of water from the soil it needs to overcome a large amount of negative potential caused by dramatic decrease in soil water potential and resistance caused by a dramatic decrease in soil hydraulic conductivity it is at this point that groundwater uptake starts to become more thermodynamically favorable than soil water uptake and the plants subsequently increase their groundwater uptake in contrast during wet seasons soil layers and the layers near water table are all wet with relatively high water potential and hydraulic conductivity because groundwater is relatively deep 10 m at our study site if plants extract groundwater they needed extra energy to overcome gravitational potential to lift water therefore soil water uptake was more thermodynamically favorable during wet seasons and plants use shallow soil moisture preferentially in contrast during wet seasons soil layers and the layers near water table are all wet with relatively high water potential and hydraulic conductivity because groundwater is relatively deep 10 m at our study site if plants extract groundwater they needed extra energy to overcome gravitational potential to lift water therefore soil water uptake was more thermodynamically favorable during wet seasons and plants use shallow soil moisture preferentially although the top soil layer at 20 cm depth and groundwater 10 m at our study site do not have direct hydraulic connections the dynamics of root water uptake from these layers is still tightly linked this relationship helps to explain the phenomena found in the study of bleby et al 2010 that deep roots are tightly coordinated with shallow roots to supply plant water use and hr similar relationships were reported in the study of barbeta et al 2015 at the mediterranean prades holm oak forest in the iberian peninsula they found that when soil water content is less than 10 it coincides with the increase of groundwater uptake the critical point when plants switch from soil water uptake to groundwater uptake may be impacted by many factors such as climate conditions soil water characteristics water table depth soil thickness plant vulnerability to drought root density and root hydraulic conductivity we tested the impacts of soil types on the critical point the cases with two soil types a finer texture of silt loam and a coarser texture of loamy sand were compared to the baseline simulation in the previous analysis the soil water retention curves of three soil types and the critical points were shown in fig 13 all critical points were close to the positions where the slopes of the curves change dramatically indicating that a small decline in soil water content would cause significant decreases in water potential and hydraulic conductivity the critical point in the case of loamy sand corresponded to the point with the lowest soil water content and the highest soil water potential the coarse soil does not retain much water in the soil layer in this case plants would switch to use groundwater at the early stage when soil water potential was high while less soil water was available we postulate that plants use groundwater earlier as the climate becomes drier soil texture coarser water table shallower and soils were shallower vegetation with lower resistance to xylem cavitation higher root fractions accessing groundwater and higher hydraulic conductivity of the tap root will also switch to groundwater use at higher soil moisture contents further measurements and model simulations are needed to explore these hypotheses of plant water source shift 6 conclusions we integrated new functions for modeling the dynamics of groundwater dependent vegetation gou and miller 2014 into a spatially distributed groundwater land surface model parflow clm maxwell and miller 2005 to improve its performance in simulating plant root water uptake hydraulic redistribution and plant water stress the modified model was tested at a mediterranean oak savanna site and performed well capturing the daily hourly and spatial water and energy patterns in 8 year model simulations comparing the results from the original parflow clm model the compensation model and the modified model three models had similar performance in the wet season but yielded substantially different results for deep rooted vegetation in the dry season the modified model had several key advantages for simulating groundwater land surface atmosphere interactions which allowed for a number of insights into the water use behaviors of groundwater dependent vegetation the new root water uptake function used in the model allowed it to capture the seasonal shift in the depth at which plants extract water from the subsurface the model revealed that groundwater contributed to tree transpiration later in the dry season when soil water was depleted consistent with the analysis from diurnal water table fluctuation data this suggests that the relative influence of soil moisture and groundwater on the atmosphere changes dramatically over the course of a growing season this shift of plant water sources has been widely observed but it is currently ignored in most land surface models the root water uptake function in the original model extracted water from different layers simultaneously potentially leading to biases in modeling of land surface atmosphere interactions and climate prediction especially in long term simulations the compensation model simulated the shift in plant water source but it overestimated the groundwater use during the dry seasons in addition the new root water uptake function simultaneously simulated hr which had been widely found in many species the new function predicted both hydraulic lift and hydraulic descent during plant active and dormant seasons the new plant water stress function was based on the linear relationship between the changes of stomatal conductance and the changes of hydraulic conductance in roots it was capable of capturing the latent heat dynamics and proved to be valuable for simulating groundwater dependent vegetation whose root systems span various moisture conditions instead of using the parameters of wilting point and stress point the new function considers species specific vulnerable curves in its calculation which allowed the model to be applied in assessing vegetation vulnerability to drought for specific plants the modified model predicted leaf water potential and xylem cavitation which had advantages in the simulation of plants in arid and semiarid areas where the plants may suffer periodic water stress and cavitation the model results of predawn leaf water potential dropped to as low as 6 mpa during dry seasons indicating that the oaks suffered severe water stress even when they were using reliable groundwater and hydraulic lift occurred however the results of root cavitation revealed that groundwater uptake was still critical for plants to prevent hydraulic failure in shallow roots during dry seasons if groundwater uptake was cut off the loss of hydraulic conductance in shallow roots would likely near 100 in mid july or august in addition our simulations indicated a critical point when plants switched from soil water dependence to groundwater dependence this critical soil water content value coincided with large changes in the slope of the soil water retention curve when surface soil water content dropped below the critical point soil water potential and soil hydraulic conductivity decreased dramatically and a small amount of soil water uptake was needed to overcome a large amount of negative potential and resistance at this point groundwater uptake became thermodynamically more favorable than soil water uptake this critical point was tightly related to the hydraulic characteristics of both soil and plants climate condition water table depth and soil thickness overall this study highlighted the impacts of groundwater dependent vegetation on groundwater land surface atmosphere interactions the model tool presented in this paper captured several important ecohydrological processes which were not available in many hydrological and land surface models these modeling efforts can help improve our fundamental understanding of plant water use patterns and their effects on large scale water and energy balances acknowledgments the authors

757,this article details an approach for modeling the motion of large flexible fiber like colloids including micro plastic fibers through porous media fibers and other fiber like colloids such as bacteria have unique shapes and properties that make modeling them more difficult than dissolved solutes and necessitate unique tools the approach uses the concept of a bead rod chain to discretize the fibers as discrete objects that move through the flow field each node of the chain is moved independently via a classical random walk but we enforce the constraint that the length of the fiber cannot change over time which effectively adds a force balance to the random walk problem after a brief illustrative example our main question evaluates some of the tradeoffs between pore water velocity fiber length and the size of the pore spaces in a 4 cm by 12 cm synthetic model of pore scale flow in granular material we find that fiber length is generally correlated to retardation relative to a passive tracer and the magnitude of retardation tends to increase with increasing average pore water velocity however the simulations also show that in some cases fibers shorter than the average pore opening can pass through the experiment faster than a solute this alludes to the complexities and sometimes counter intuitive nature of the transport behavior of discrete non dissolved objects through porous media which merit experimental study in the future to validate our results against experimental data and to refine the proposed hypothesis testing platform keywords random walks micro fiber transport micro plastic transport colloid transport 1 introduction understanding the motion of large colloids in the environment is a significant challenge because of the myriad of factors that can influence their mobility including their non trivial size one class of large colloids with contemporary interest is micro plastic pollution which is rapidly becoming a high profile emerging contaminant micro plastics are generally classified as plastic particles that are less than 5 mm in size and these can be diverse in composition and shape micro plastics often take the form of beads that were manufactured for use directly in products like personal hygiene but beads can also form as other plastics break down eerkes medrano et al 2015 these generally spherical colloids have a steadily growing body of research including their mobility e g besseling et al 2017 but plastic fibers represent an entirely different problem with comparatively little research micro plastic fibers mpfs have existed for decades and are the primary building block of countless synthetic fabrics and their products including fleece and nylon jackets blankets and socks among many others these fibers can be shed into the environment from normal wear of garments or released down the drain with wash water hartline et al 2016 in the latter case it is now known that they can escape wastewater treatment plants in significant quantities murphy et al 2016 and that land application of sludge may be a another even larger source nizzetto et al 2016 zubris and richards 2005 despite their known sources to date there has been little research on the dynamics of mpf or other fiber like objects motion in the environment most of the existing literature focuses on identifying the presence or absence of mpfs in different environments and approximating their amounts because isolating and quantifying the mass of the fibers is more complicated than monitoring solutes claessens et al 2013 consequently their migration rates have been described using laboratory experiments that were used to inform upscaled numerical simulations e g besseling et al 2017 the problem with this approach is that it does not afford isolation of the different processes that may be affecting mpf mobility such as mechanical filtration electrical surface interactions or a combination of fiber self agglomeration flocculation and trapping investigation of these questions requires a physically based model of the dynamics of fiber motion but constructing such a model is not trivial fiber density is similar to water i e near neutral buoyancy but suspended fibers do not behave like dissolved solutes because each is a discrete flexible object mpfs are also not spherical so their motion falls outside of much of the existing colloid filtration theory and they are orders of magnitude larger than rod shaped microbes bacteria or viruses so the current predominant transport theories have limited applicability for direct mechanistic modeling considering these factors there is a need for physically based tools to begin exploring the transport processes of mpfs in the environment in order to provide more realistic evaluations of their fate and any associated short or long term risks this paper begins to develop a dynamic numerical framework designed for the simulation of the transport of fiber like objects in porous media at the fluid continuum level i e pore scale our specific interest is to eventually enable the direct simulation of micro plastic fibers but presently there is no direct data on the movement of mpfs in soils to validate such a model so we present a general framework that can be adapted to any large fiber like colloids the core of the framework is adapted from studies of micro scale polymer dynamics liu 1989 and similar to methods used to simulate the rheology of wood and composite fibers in simple flows derksen 2010 schmid and klingenberg 2000 switzer and klingenberg 2004 the physically based approach adopts a bead rod chain model for the fibers which discretizes a fiber into equidistant segments joined by pivoting nodes the approach uses a two step predictor corrector method to update the nodal positions over time nodes are moved with a classical random walk and their relative positions are adjusted by a correcting force to enforce the constraint that each fiber must have constant length throughout the simulation basic rules can be added to prevent unrealistic behaviors like excessive twisting and the approach also readily lends itself to incorporating external forces or interactions between fibers fibers and solids as well as solute attachment and reactions the first example illustrates the difference between this method and the unconstrained motion more typical of solute transport simulations and the second example provides the first demonstration of the dynamics of fiber transport through porous media at the pore scale particularly the role of fiber length on retardation the results show that the flow speed and fiber length relative to the mean pore opening are both factors in the transport rates of fibers through porous media and that even in the absence of any electrostatic interactions fiber transport can deviate significantly from that expected of passive solutes the supplementary information for this manuscript includes additional notes on convergence scaling of breakthrough curves fiber trajectories and an animation of the simulations that may be of interest to some readers our mechanistic framework proposes a method for how to model the motion of fiber like colloids but it requires verification against laboratory data we are unaware of any existing data sets with sufficient resolution for this purpose and are actively working to generate these data so the model can be validated and refined 2 simulating fiber transport the main conceptual element of the proposed model is referred to as a kramer s chain a freely jointed chain or a bead rod chain brc several models for these have been proposed in the past e g doyle et al 1997 kim et al 2010 moghani and khomami 2017 stowicka et al 2012 and the essential elements are described by liu 1989 but the basic concept is that a single fiber will be discretized as a 1 d line object in 2 or 3 dimensional space the foundation of the method is a two step predictor corrector algorithm introduced by liu 1989 which is also central to the approaches used in the preceding example studies what follows is reproduced from liu 1989 for the sake of completeness and we have kept the original notation wherever possible so there are only minor notational differences the fiber like object is represented by a series of rigid rods that are lined up end to end and each is connected to its neighbor with a rotating joint the first step of the process moves each node deterministically according to a prescribed drift field i e advection and then applies a random stochastic perturbation to simulate brownian fluctuations of the nodal positions gravity density and momentum effects can all be included in this step if required since they have similar effects on the nodal trajectories the length of each line segment the rods along the chain changes during the first step because each node is moved independently so these temporary unconstrained positions of the nodes represent a stretched or squished fiber and constitute the predictor estimate the second step the corrector uses lagrange multipliers and picard iteration to enforce the constraint that the length of the fiber cannot change from its initial length in principle other forces can be added prior to applying the corrector step which could include resistance to folding see section 2 2 and interaction potentials the key point is that the two step process allows a relatively simple model for the motion of the nodal positions while enforcing the unique length constraint posed by fibers the position vector x of the νth node of a given fiber is updated over time as 1 x ν t δ t x ν t δ t ϵ ν where x represents one step in an unconstrained random walk and ϵ ν is a correction force vector in d dimensional space that enforces the constraints on line length for simplicity we assume that all rods are the same length a so the total length of a chain with n beads and n 1 rods is at all times a n 1 l where l is the total fiber length the first step of the algorithm simulates an advection dispersion process using standard random walk methods 2 x ν t δ t x ν t v x ν t δ t α ζ δ w where v is a drift vector field δw is a random d dimensional standard normal gaussian random variable α 2 d δ t where d is a diffusion coefficient i e brownian motion ζ is a friction coefficient see liu 1989 and the identifies this as the position during the predictor step 2 1 enforcing length constraints the corrector step accounts for the fact that the unconstrained motion of each node to x ν has changed the length of the fiber the challenge is how to compute the net result of the forces on the uncorrected positions giving the values of ϵ ν at each time step that maintain the original length operationally the changes in the lengths of individual segments deformations are used as a proxy for the force acting on each node following liu 1989 the constraint forces for a single chain can be found as 3 ϵ ν 2 a δ t ζ i γ i b i ν u i t where the ν index denotes nodes beads and i denotes rods u i is the unit vector connecting the ith and i 1 th nodes of the chain nodes prior to the unconstrained motion for i 1 to n 1 a is the uniform length of the rods with b i ν δ i 1 ν δ i ν where δ i ν is the kronecker delta lagrange multipliers γi are defined for each of the n 1 rods to enforce the following constraint 4 u i t δ t 2 1 2 0 which requires the final perturbed lengths of u i to also be unit vectors after correction the combination of these equations results in the following quadratic 5 0 2 δ t ζ 2 j γ j a i j u j t 2 4 δ t ζ j γ j a i j u i t δ t u j t u i t δ t 2 1 where i and j are indices over the rods in the chain 6 a i j 2 if i j 1 if i j 1 0 otherwise also known as the rouse matrix and 7 a u i t δ t x i 1 t δ t x i t δ t define the vectors between the endpoints of the ith rod after unconstrained motion the lagrange multipliers of this nonlinear system are found via picard iteration where sequential approximations of γ denoted γ i n are obtained from 8 4 δ t ζ j γ j n a i j u i t δ t u j t u i t δ t 2 1 2 δ t ζ 2 j γ j n 1 a i j u j 2 the procedure begins with γ i 0 0 and is iterated until the specified tolerance φ is satisfied for all constraints herein we adopt a value of φ 1 x 10 6 in practice we found that this approach is efficient and converges rapidly as reported by liu 1989 so long as the random displacements are small relative to the advective displacements and velocity gradients are not excessive across the length of the fiber when problems are encountered convergence is dramatically improved by simply reducing the time step for example we found that longer fibers section 4 1 tended to require smaller time steps to ensure convergence relative to shorter fibers in any case the final values of γ i n are then substituted into eq 3 and the final state of all nodes along the fiber at time t δ t are found with eq 1 which now satisfy the constant rod length constraint aside from minor notational changes the only difference between what is shown here from the original liu 1989 implementation lies in the definition of α which dictates the strength of the diffusion process liu 1989 defined this in terms of the boltzmann constant a stokes friction coefficient and the absolute temperature of the system whereas we adopt the brownian motion analog more common to transport in porous media of 2 d δ t we also note that the components of the random displacement vector δw can be scaled to make anisotropic spreading but for simplicity we assume this to be isotropic and we also define ζ 1 since we have no data on this parameter for mpfs in water 2 2 preventing folding brc models may pivot freely around any node joint and this is a significant difference between the model and reality given the right combination of flow conditions and random displacements it is possible for the entire chain to collapse near a point either as a folded line or a circular shape like many other fibers mpfs only bend up to a certain point and do not generally fold over themselves without the application of significant external forces that are unlikely in fluid flows switzer and klingenberg 2004 discuss many of the details needed to strictly enforce rigidity and elasticity but in the absence of detailed data on how plastic fiber like objects fold we propose a simple solution for now folding occurs when two non adjacent nodes pass through the vector connecting another node pair so we introduce a minimum separation distance between non adjacent nodes and impose this as a force prior to the enforcement of the nonlinear constraints operationally the 2 d separation distances between all nodes along a given fiber can be found as 9 ds n u x 2 u y 2 1 2 where u x x x t is a square matrix of the separation distances in x between the nodes on the nth fiber and x i x where i is an np x 1 identity vector x n is the 1 x np vector containing the x coordinates of all nodes of the nth fiber and ds is the matrix containing the distances between all nodes analogous definitions apply for the y component as u y and a generalization to 3 d is straightforward for non adjacent nodes that are less than some dsmin apart we push the nodes away from each other before correcting the total fiber length the offending nodes are pushed away from each other along the vector linking them whose components are defined by u x and u y and each node is moved half of the offending distance strictly this simple approach does not precisely reflect the physical process which more closely resembles a rotation but recall that this push is applied prior to the corrector step so this is essentially just adding a repulsive force and the net rotation effect is achieved after correction preventing crossing or folding is a conceptual simplification of stiffness based on preliminary laboratory testing see section 3 that is not expected to significantly affect our results but it merits a more detailed investigation in the future as more data on the transport properties of the fibers becomes available note that this feature is another departure from the liu 1989 algorithm but it is similar to a stiffness constraint imposed by stowicka et al 2012 we found that d s m i n 0 36 mm produces fiber behaviors similar to observations and to stowicka et al 2012 including the tumbling of a fiber over itself shown below but with a simpler implementation we emphasize that more rigorous alternatives to this approach exist in schmid and klingenberg 2000 and switzer and klingenberg 2004 and we intend to incorporate these in future versions of the model their extra computational demand is not warranted at the present time again due to a lack of data on the parameters 2 3 simplifications one simplification of this model is that each fiber is assumed to be a mass less 1 d line object in 2 or 3 d space this is not expected to affect the results since fibers are generally neutrally buoyant and the flexibility constraint of section 2 2 is an approximation of some of the effects of having thickness another simplification is the omission of attractive forces between different fibers and between fibers and solids given a model for their interactions these can both be incorporated as additional forces in the simulation between the unconstrained predictor step and the corrector so only one computationally expensive nonlinear iteration is necessary regardless of which are included we expect that the lack of interaction forces between fibers and grains will have an impact on the results but we are unaware of any data on the interaction potentials between mpfs and granular material so the inclusion of any force would be purely speculative at this point however when these data become available robust modeling of these forces including friction can be included following schmid and klingenberg 2000 and switzer and klingenberg 2004 another simplification is that the fibers are assumed to be suspended in clean water with no compounds attached to the surface it is known that mpfs tend to function as hyperaccumulators of metals anderson et al 2016 andrady 2011 and are likely hotspots for their associated reactions both of which could also be included recent particle based methods for simulating solute transport diffusion mass transfer and reactions e g benson and bolster 2017 bolster et al 2015 engdahl et al 2017 can also easily be incorporated into the numerical scheme where diffusion and reaction can be made to occur along individual fibers all of these simplifications are made for simplicity but they are interesting prospects for future work that could bring a high degree of realism to the models however in the absence of more detailed data in these areas we move on to the examples 3 rotational flow example the approach shown here is likely to be unfamiliar to readers so we provide a brief comparison of the brc algorithm and a non constrained random walk rw this example represents fibers spinning in a laminar rotational velocity field such as a slowly stirred container the complete source code needed to reproduce this example is available from the corresponding author note that the discretization of a fiber as a brc can affect the overall magnitude of the diffusive displacements and also advective transport when it is allowed in ways that are different from solute plumes since this subject is peripheral to this example the details of these tradeoffs are discussed in the supplementary information document a simple analytical flow field is assumed that represents the gradual deceleration of a vortex that formed in a stirred container of water with fibers suspended in it the 2 d rotational velocity field centered at the origin uses v v x v y with components given by 10a v x t y ν t ξ 10b v y t x ν t ξ where xν and yν are the coordinates of the νth node of a given fiber and ξ 1 20 is a dimensionless scale factor to attenuate the rotation speed the example uses 10 fibers each of uniform length of 1 5 l and each fiber is discretized into 10 nodes and 9 connecting rods each fiber is initialized as a straight line centered at the origin rotated randomly about its centroid then shifted randomly away from the origin with an offset up to a maximum of x y 1 l giving each fiber a random position away from the center of the vortex and a variety of orientations the first simulation is the brc model without the folding constraint section 2 2 to highlight the intricacies of the rod chain note that tight fiber folding is prevented in the next example the simulation proceeds with δ t 5 0 x 10 2 t up to t 100 t 2000 time steps and the random displacements use d 5 0 10 5 l 2 t 1 the second simulation is an unconstrained random walk and this simply assumes that ϵ ν 0 at all times for all nodes both simulations use the same random seed and consequently the exact same sequence of random displacements all differences between the two are due to the force balance imposed by the constraint equations the initial condition of both systems are shown in fig 1 a and the final states of the brc and unconstrained models are shown in fig 1c and d respectively these visual comparisons highlight the differences between the models and these are quantified more precisely by the fiber lengths over time in fig 1b where the dashed lines are the brc model and the solid lines are the rw model every brc fiber maintains constant length at all times detailed validation of the proposed model is complicated by its stochastic nature but a qualitative validation experiment was conducted in the water resources and environmental laboratory at washington state university fibers were stripped off from a mid weight 200 g m2 fleece cloth via friction while scrubbing the clean dark fleece by hand in clear water then adding the fiber water to a slowly stirred beaker to create a vortex the most notable differences were that the fibers in the beaker could not be made perfectly linear initially and that the angles between nodes in the simulations were sharper than observed in the experiment a result of the discretization of the fibers and the omission of the folding constraint but the general behavior of the two were similar the same basic properties seen in the beaker experiment can also be reproduced by any interested reader simply by rubbing two dark colored clean socks together by hand in a sink with water opening the drain for a short while then closing it as the vortex spins the flow field qualitative validation aside the most important point about the model is that the length of the fibers remains constant fig 1b despite the strong velocity gradients along the fiber caused by the rotational flow field this shows that the force balance is being enforced that slow nodes can be pulled ahead by faster ones and conversely that fast nodes can be dragged by slow nodes 4 fiber mobility through porous media there is a lack of data on the interaction potentials between fibers so rather than offer speculative models for these forces our main example focuses on physical filtration through porous media fibers are fundamentally different than solutes because they are suspended in the fluid but not dissolved in it further the finite length of fibers means that the net motion of the fiber is a product of the velocity distribution along the fiber so a straightforward hypothesis that can be evaluated with the proposed method is that deviations from solute transport will increase as the length of the flexible fibers are increased the porous media selected for this example represents a poorly consolidated deposit such as those formed in alluvial settings or low order fluvial deposits where mpfs are expected to be found since wastewater treatment discharges are often into these settings we assume a mixture of smooth gravel and deterministically define a pore scale geometry based on observations of coarse grained alluvial deposits note that this domain is merely an example and future studies considering smaller grains will be needed to complement this preliminary demonstration the synthetic 2 d porous domain has length 12 cm by 4 cm wide with uniform cell sizes of δ x δ y 0 2 mm and the porosity of this domain is roughly 38 within the granular region fig 2 note that the selected cell size gives 10 cells in the average pore throat which is 2 mm to provide good resolution of the velocity profile the domain intentionally has few dead end pores to compensate for situations where in a fully 3 d domain solutes or fibers might be able to flow around a constriction or pore throat accordingly one might consider this a random obstacle model since it is not a precise reconstruction of 3 d porous media the left and right ends of the domain each have a small open buffer zone of width λ 10 mm between the boundary and the porous grains this gap allows fibers to be placed randomly and at random orientations in this region before being drawn into the domain avoiding some of the complexities of randomly placing non point objects fibers are centered randomly along the vertical axis of the domain and passive particles are also placed along the same plane x 0 5 cm the velocity field for this domain was solved using lattice boltzmann methods following chen and doolen 1998 a d2q9 lattice with a single relaxation factor of unity was used and a specified flux was prescribed for the domain of 25 m d giving an arithmetic mean pore water velocity of about 40 m d for the base flow rate or about 26 m d as the geometric mean this would be a high flow rate in consolidated aquifers but it reasonable for the coarse unconsolidated gravel deposits being depicted fig 2 the diffusion coefficient is d 3 75 10 6 m 2 d 1 the velocity field is fully resolved at the pore scale so no dispersivity factor is needed based on the average velocity and the average pore opening the peclet number is about 24 note that lattice boltzman simulations are scaled representations of flows where the base time unit of the simulation is dictated by the lattice size see chen and doolen 1998 and one lattice time unit here is roughly 7 ms this ensures the low mach number requirements of the lattice boltzmann simulation are satisfied we found that using this time step for the transport simulations ensured rapid convergence of the nonlinear solver for the constraint equations the first simulations were an unconstrained random walk representing the transport of a passive solute through the domain using 1 0 104 particles for simplicity any diffusive displacements into an inactive boundary cell are rejected instead of being reflected since this is a high peclet situation we do not expect this to significantly impact the results particles were released halfway through the buffer zone along a vertical line where they were uniformly randomly distributed fig 2 dotted line and the breakthrough plane is located halfway across the opposite buffer zone fig 2 dashed line the breakthrough curve for the passive tracer is shown in fig 4a c as the black dashed lines for the slow base and fast velocity fields respectively and the time scale of each is normalized by the median breakthrough time τk for that speed note that the slow velocity is half of the base velocity the fast is twice the base velocity and that all three of the passive breakthrough curves are essentially fickian the fiber simulations were conducted by releasing 300 fibers into the domain and a snapshot of one simulation is shown in fig 3 each fiber was assumed to start halfway across the buffer zone but its position vertically was random subject to the constraint that it is entirely within the simulation domain and its orientation was also random here the random displacements use the same diffusion coefficient as the solute however the effectivity diffusivity of a node will be less than this because the diffusive motions are subjected to the constraint forces arrival at the monitoring plane for a fiber was defined by the center of mass of the fiber crossing the breakthrough plane after which the fiber was removed from the simulation the breakthrough curve is defined here as the fraction of fibers that have passed the monitoring plane by convention we normalize fiber breakthrough times by the median breakthrough time of the passive tracer note that breakthrough curves are used here solely to quantify the transport behavior and we make no assumptions or implications about any1 d effective upsacled models for describing fiber mobility the scaling of these results at different breakthrough planes across the domain are shown in the supplementary information for interested readers but the question of upscaled transport equations for fibers is left for future study before proceeding we note that 300 fibers may not seem like a large ensemble compared to most particle tracking studies but recall that each is a discrete object comprised of multiple interacting nodes and this samples more of the velocity field than an individual particle would we found that increasing the number of fibers did not significantly affect the median breakthrough time and only affected the tail so the extra runtime was not necessary for our example simulations which are not presently focused on tailing this convergence analysis is included in the supplemental information section recall also that the fibers do not interact with each other in this simulation so adding more does not affect the behavior of the ensemble although this is a preliminary simplification that will be relaxed as data become available however this leads to the bigger issue of runtime since constraints must be enforced we found that 300 fibers with 12 nodes per fiber took approximately 40x longer to run than 1 0 104 particles using matlab as the computational engine enforcement of the constraint forces comes with a price and this is a tremendous runtime difference but we note that our initial algorithm has not yet been optimized for speed so significant performance gains may be attainable 4 1 fiber length effects the normal length fiber is discretized as 12 nodes and 11 connecting rods a 0 18 mm where the total length of the fiber is initially l 2 0 mm or roughly the same length as the average pore throat short fibers remove 4 nodes moderate fibers add 4 nodes and long fibers add 8 nodes this keeps the discretization of the rod segments constant while changing the fiber length by 33 33 and 66 conceptually think of this as a piece of thread cut to different lengths and only the smallest is smaller than the average pore opening note that the length of the fiber can affect its behavior and this is a complex balance of factors preliminary testing and visual analysis of these lengths showed similar dynamics and deformations in all four cases so for now we adopt the simplest possible approach but this is another area where improvements can be made once more data is available the base case velocity simulation fig 4b clearly shows the hypothesized impact of fiber length on the filtration rate and there is a clear correlation between the two as the fiber length increases each fiber is able to sample more of the velocity field and this exposes each fiber to a more heterogeneous distribution of velocities small fibers are able to align themselves with the local velocity field essentially balancing the high and low velocities around them which is an interesting parallel to the dynamics of the particle ensemble visual inspection of trajectories showed that longer fibers also attempt to do this but they are unable to sustain a favorable orientation over long times the extra length also allows them to wrap around grains see fig 3 where they can spend long times and become trapped even in the absence of electrical or friction forces the short fibers showed little to no retardation relative to the passive tracer and there is a sequential increase in the retardation rate that is related to the ratio of the fiber length to the average pore throat a logical supporting question is what is the role of the mean filtration velocity on fiber mobility two additional sets of simulations were conducted using half the average velocity fig 4a and twice the average velocity fig 4c relative to the base case referred to as the slower and faster cases respectively as one would expect the median breakthrough time of the passive tracers for each of these scaled proportionately to the changes in flux i e twice the flux resulted in breakthrough twice as fast table 1 presents the relative speed of the median breakthrough time for each of the fiber simulations of different length columns delineated by the relative speed of the simulation rows all times are normalized by the median breakthrough time of a passive tracer for each speed the slower simulations exhibited the least retardation the faster simulations experienced the most and in each case the magnitude of the filtration speed was proportionate to the length of the fiber an interesting result is that there was more retardation in the faster case than the slower case we hypothesize that the cause of this is the no slip condition imposed at the fluid grain boundary because regardless of the average fluid speed the velocity at the boundary must go to zero this implies that the same pore throat experiences a higher velocity gradient across it under fast flow than a slow flow this can also be seen from in the classic poiseuille flow profile see stowicka et al 2012 solutes are able to overcome this high velocity contrast because they are independent and are able to transition to different streamlines but the discrete nature of fibers prevents them from doing the same portions of the fiber that are near the boundary cause a sustained drag force on the rest of the fiber that is difficult to overcome a second consequence of the longer length is that it can also cause collapsing of a fiber as it transitions from a fast flow through a throat into the slower pore openings for example consider a case where the leading edge of a fiber is decelerating as the trailing end is still moving fast the net force from the tail can push the fiber into slow regions most solutes would avoid with a momentum like effect another interesting result is seen in the short fiber simulation for the slow velocity field fig 4a because it had a higher median transport rate than the passive tracer this implies that shorter fibers are able to bypass slow regions fibers that are significantly shorter than the pore throats are able to orient themselves parallel to the faster velocities where they sample less of the velocity heterogeneity consequently they are less likely than long fibers to be pushed into slow regions and tend to get caught around grain surfaces less frequently the supplementary information contains a plot showing specific fiber trajectories and also a time series animation of the left edge of the domain to help readers better visualize these behaviors naturally further research into these processes is necessary to better understand the relationships between fiber size pore openings and different distributions of grain sizes and fiber lengths we expect that a combination of experimentally determined trajectories and the proposed numerical framework will provide a powerful hypothesis testing tool for understanding the transport of these large colloids 5 discussion the results here are complementary to some of the previous work using bead rod chain models most notably the work of stowicka et al 2012 who considered the motion of elastic fibers in a poiseuille flow and observed many of the same flipping and rotating behaviors lamura and winkler 2015 also considered polymer chains and investigated some of their dynamics properties in uniform and shear flows and moghani and khomami 2017 used similar techniques to evaluate hydrodynamic interactions of macromolecules other related work has been done in the area of rheology considering the influence of deformable stretching polymers on fluids e g doyle et al 1997 winkler et al 2014 but the present study is the first to our knowledge to consider discrete fiber mobility in porous media our example simulations show that fiber transport may behave like solutes when the lengths of the fibers is on the order of or smaller than the mean pore size but the role of electrical and surface interactions needs to be investigated in detail presently there is no data on the interaction potentials but we are learning from ongoing laboratory experiments that the fraction of fibers that will be trapped in porous media is higher than seen here since these are preliminary simulations that are meant to highlight a novel numerical tool we caution the reader that the mobility of the fibers seen here is likely greater than reality because rough grain edges flocculation friction and electrical interactions all lead to trapping it is possible to include these factors see derksen 2010 schmid and klingenberg 2000 switzer and klingenberg 2004 with a significant increase in computational cost but the lack of data led us to omit them for simplicity in this demonstration allowing us to focus on the first order differences between the transport of infinitesimal solutes and finite flexible fibers objects the main point of this article is that simulation of flexible fiber transport is more complicated than solute transport both operationally and in the kinds of transport behaviors that are exhibited but doing so mechanistically is tractable in realistic porous domains at the scale of the fluid continuum the main operational concerns are the high computational demand required to enforce the various constraints these include at a minimum a fixed length for the bead rod chains and may also include constraints that prevent twisting and folding of fibers onto themselves the limited folding constraint imposed here require knowing the distances between all nodes on a single fiber not just the nearest neighbors but this is only a moderate computational increase when the number of nodes is small direct simulation of fiber interaction forces will also require knowing the distances between every node of every fiber and consideration of surface interactions requires knowing the distances to every surface adding significant computational burden many of these challenges are similar to those recently encountered in particle based simulations of solute transport where efficient search algorithms must be employed e g benson and bolster 2017 bolster et al 2015 but the simple fact is that this level of realism comes with a high computational cost benson et al 2017 and every additional process will also have a cost however a physically based simulation tool with the ability to add these features is crucial for exploring how to most efficiently upscale fiber transport behaviors and the animation and trajectories included with the supplementary information will help the reader see these behaviors more clearly our intent is to combine this numerical hypothesis testing platform with direct observations of fiber mobility including detailed trajectories from future laboratory experiments to validate revise and refine our knowledge of the dynamics of large fiber like colloids supplementary material supplementary material associated with this article can be

757,this article details an approach for modeling the motion of large flexible fiber like colloids including micro plastic fibers through porous media fibers and other fiber like colloids such as bacteria have unique shapes and properties that make modeling them more difficult than dissolved solutes and necessitate unique tools the approach uses the concept of a bead rod chain to discretize the fibers as discrete objects that move through the flow field each node of the chain is moved independently via a classical random walk but we enforce the constraint that the length of the fiber cannot change over time which effectively adds a force balance to the random walk problem after a brief illustrative example our main question evaluates some of the tradeoffs between pore water velocity fiber length and the size of the pore spaces in a 4 cm by 12 cm synthetic model of pore scale flow in granular material we find that fiber length is generally correlated to retardation relative to a passive tracer and the magnitude of retardation tends to increase with increasing average pore water velocity however the simulations also show that in some cases fibers shorter than the average pore opening can pass through the experiment faster than a solute this alludes to the complexities and sometimes counter intuitive nature of the transport behavior of discrete non dissolved objects through porous media which merit experimental study in the future to validate our results against experimental data and to refine the proposed hypothesis testing platform keywords random walks micro fiber transport micro plastic transport colloid transport 1 introduction understanding the motion of large colloids in the environment is a significant challenge because of the myriad of factors that can influence their mobility including their non trivial size one class of large colloids with contemporary interest is micro plastic pollution which is rapidly becoming a high profile emerging contaminant micro plastics are generally classified as plastic particles that are less than 5 mm in size and these can be diverse in composition and shape micro plastics often take the form of beads that were manufactured for use directly in products like personal hygiene but beads can also form as other plastics break down eerkes medrano et al 2015 these generally spherical colloids have a steadily growing body of research including their mobility e g besseling et al 2017 but plastic fibers represent an entirely different problem with comparatively little research micro plastic fibers mpfs have existed for decades and are the primary building block of countless synthetic fabrics and their products including fleece and nylon jackets blankets and socks among many others these fibers can be shed into the environment from normal wear of garments or released down the drain with wash water hartline et al 2016 in the latter case it is now known that they can escape wastewater treatment plants in significant quantities murphy et al 2016 and that land application of sludge may be a another even larger source nizzetto et al 2016 zubris and richards 2005 despite their known sources to date there has been little research on the dynamics of mpf or other fiber like objects motion in the environment most of the existing literature focuses on identifying the presence or absence of mpfs in different environments and approximating their amounts because isolating and quantifying the mass of the fibers is more complicated than monitoring solutes claessens et al 2013 consequently their migration rates have been described using laboratory experiments that were used to inform upscaled numerical simulations e g besseling et al 2017 the problem with this approach is that it does not afford isolation of the different processes that may be affecting mpf mobility such as mechanical filtration electrical surface interactions or a combination of fiber self agglomeration flocculation and trapping investigation of these questions requires a physically based model of the dynamics of fiber motion but constructing such a model is not trivial fiber density is similar to water i e near neutral buoyancy but suspended fibers do not behave like dissolved solutes because each is a discrete flexible object mpfs are also not spherical so their motion falls outside of much of the existing colloid filtration theory and they are orders of magnitude larger than rod shaped microbes bacteria or viruses so the current predominant transport theories have limited applicability for direct mechanistic modeling considering these factors there is a need for physically based tools to begin exploring the transport processes of mpfs in the environment in order to provide more realistic evaluations of their fate and any associated short or long term risks this paper begins to develop a dynamic numerical framework designed for the simulation of the transport of fiber like objects in porous media at the fluid continuum level i e pore scale our specific interest is to eventually enable the direct simulation of micro plastic fibers but presently there is no direct data on the movement of mpfs in soils to validate such a model so we present a general framework that can be adapted to any large fiber like colloids the core of the framework is adapted from studies of micro scale polymer dynamics liu 1989 and similar to methods used to simulate the rheology of wood and composite fibers in simple flows derksen 2010 schmid and klingenberg 2000 switzer and klingenberg 2004 the physically based approach adopts a bead rod chain model for the fibers which discretizes a fiber into equidistant segments joined by pivoting nodes the approach uses a two step predictor corrector method to update the nodal positions over time nodes are moved with a classical random walk and their relative positions are adjusted by a correcting force to enforce the constraint that each fiber must have constant length throughout the simulation basic rules can be added to prevent unrealistic behaviors like excessive twisting and the approach also readily lends itself to incorporating external forces or interactions between fibers fibers and solids as well as solute attachment and reactions the first example illustrates the difference between this method and the unconstrained motion more typical of solute transport simulations and the second example provides the first demonstration of the dynamics of fiber transport through porous media at the pore scale particularly the role of fiber length on retardation the results show that the flow speed and fiber length relative to the mean pore opening are both factors in the transport rates of fibers through porous media and that even in the absence of any electrostatic interactions fiber transport can deviate significantly from that expected of passive solutes the supplementary information for this manuscript includes additional notes on convergence scaling of breakthrough curves fiber trajectories and an animation of the simulations that may be of interest to some readers our mechanistic framework proposes a method for how to model the motion of fiber like colloids but it requires verification against laboratory data we are unaware of any existing data sets with sufficient resolution for this purpose and are actively working to generate these data so the model can be validated and refined 2 simulating fiber transport the main conceptual element of the proposed model is referred to as a kramer s chain a freely jointed chain or a bead rod chain brc several models for these have been proposed in the past e g doyle et al 1997 kim et al 2010 moghani and khomami 2017 stowicka et al 2012 and the essential elements are described by liu 1989 but the basic concept is that a single fiber will be discretized as a 1 d line object in 2 or 3 dimensional space the foundation of the method is a two step predictor corrector algorithm introduced by liu 1989 which is also central to the approaches used in the preceding example studies what follows is reproduced from liu 1989 for the sake of completeness and we have kept the original notation wherever possible so there are only minor notational differences the fiber like object is represented by a series of rigid rods that are lined up end to end and each is connected to its neighbor with a rotating joint the first step of the process moves each node deterministically according to a prescribed drift field i e advection and then applies a random stochastic perturbation to simulate brownian fluctuations of the nodal positions gravity density and momentum effects can all be included in this step if required since they have similar effects on the nodal trajectories the length of each line segment the rods along the chain changes during the first step because each node is moved independently so these temporary unconstrained positions of the nodes represent a stretched or squished fiber and constitute the predictor estimate the second step the corrector uses lagrange multipliers and picard iteration to enforce the constraint that the length of the fiber cannot change from its initial length in principle other forces can be added prior to applying the corrector step which could include resistance to folding see section 2 2 and interaction potentials the key point is that the two step process allows a relatively simple model for the motion of the nodal positions while enforcing the unique length constraint posed by fibers the position vector x of the νth node of a given fiber is updated over time as 1 x ν t δ t x ν t δ t ϵ ν where x represents one step in an unconstrained random walk and ϵ ν is a correction force vector in d dimensional space that enforces the constraints on line length for simplicity we assume that all rods are the same length a so the total length of a chain with n beads and n 1 rods is at all times a n 1 l where l is the total fiber length the first step of the algorithm simulates an advection dispersion process using standard random walk methods 2 x ν t δ t x ν t v x ν t δ t α ζ δ w where v is a drift vector field δw is a random d dimensional standard normal gaussian random variable α 2 d δ t where d is a diffusion coefficient i e brownian motion ζ is a friction coefficient see liu 1989 and the identifies this as the position during the predictor step 2 1 enforcing length constraints the corrector step accounts for the fact that the unconstrained motion of each node to x ν has changed the length of the fiber the challenge is how to compute the net result of the forces on the uncorrected positions giving the values of ϵ ν at each time step that maintain the original length operationally the changes in the lengths of individual segments deformations are used as a proxy for the force acting on each node following liu 1989 the constraint forces for a single chain can be found as 3 ϵ ν 2 a δ t ζ i γ i b i ν u i t where the ν index denotes nodes beads and i denotes rods u i is the unit vector connecting the ith and i 1 th nodes of the chain nodes prior to the unconstrained motion for i 1 to n 1 a is the uniform length of the rods with b i ν δ i 1 ν δ i ν where δ i ν is the kronecker delta lagrange multipliers γi are defined for each of the n 1 rods to enforce the following constraint 4 u i t δ t 2 1 2 0 which requires the final perturbed lengths of u i to also be unit vectors after correction the combination of these equations results in the following quadratic 5 0 2 δ t ζ 2 j γ j a i j u j t 2 4 δ t ζ j γ j a i j u i t δ t u j t u i t δ t 2 1 where i and j are indices over the rods in the chain 6 a i j 2 if i j 1 if i j 1 0 otherwise also known as the rouse matrix and 7 a u i t δ t x i 1 t δ t x i t δ t define the vectors between the endpoints of the ith rod after unconstrained motion the lagrange multipliers of this nonlinear system are found via picard iteration where sequential approximations of γ denoted γ i n are obtained from 8 4 δ t ζ j γ j n a i j u i t δ t u j t u i t δ t 2 1 2 δ t ζ 2 j γ j n 1 a i j u j 2 the procedure begins with γ i 0 0 and is iterated until the specified tolerance φ is satisfied for all constraints herein we adopt a value of φ 1 x 10 6 in practice we found that this approach is efficient and converges rapidly as reported by liu 1989 so long as the random displacements are small relative to the advective displacements and velocity gradients are not excessive across the length of the fiber when problems are encountered convergence is dramatically improved by simply reducing the time step for example we found that longer fibers section 4 1 tended to require smaller time steps to ensure convergence relative to shorter fibers in any case the final values of γ i n are then substituted into eq 3 and the final state of all nodes along the fiber at time t δ t are found with eq 1 which now satisfy the constant rod length constraint aside from minor notational changes the only difference between what is shown here from the original liu 1989 implementation lies in the definition of α which dictates the strength of the diffusion process liu 1989 defined this in terms of the boltzmann constant a stokes friction coefficient and the absolute temperature of the system whereas we adopt the brownian motion analog more common to transport in porous media of 2 d δ t we also note that the components of the random displacement vector δw can be scaled to make anisotropic spreading but for simplicity we assume this to be isotropic and we also define ζ 1 since we have no data on this parameter for mpfs in water 2 2 preventing folding brc models may pivot freely around any node joint and this is a significant difference between the model and reality given the right combination of flow conditions and random displacements it is possible for the entire chain to collapse near a point either as a folded line or a circular shape like many other fibers mpfs only bend up to a certain point and do not generally fold over themselves without the application of significant external forces that are unlikely in fluid flows switzer and klingenberg 2004 discuss many of the details needed to strictly enforce rigidity and elasticity but in the absence of detailed data on how plastic fiber like objects fold we propose a simple solution for now folding occurs when two non adjacent nodes pass through the vector connecting another node pair so we introduce a minimum separation distance between non adjacent nodes and impose this as a force prior to the enforcement of the nonlinear constraints operationally the 2 d separation distances between all nodes along a given fiber can be found as 9 ds n u x 2 u y 2 1 2 where u x x x t is a square matrix of the separation distances in x between the nodes on the nth fiber and x i x where i is an np x 1 identity vector x n is the 1 x np vector containing the x coordinates of all nodes of the nth fiber and ds is the matrix containing the distances between all nodes analogous definitions apply for the y component as u y and a generalization to 3 d is straightforward for non adjacent nodes that are less than some dsmin apart we push the nodes away from each other before correcting the total fiber length the offending nodes are pushed away from each other along the vector linking them whose components are defined by u x and u y and each node is moved half of the offending distance strictly this simple approach does not precisely reflect the physical process which more closely resembles a rotation but recall that this push is applied prior to the corrector step so this is essentially just adding a repulsive force and the net rotation effect is achieved after correction preventing crossing or folding is a conceptual simplification of stiffness based on preliminary laboratory testing see section 3 that is not expected to significantly affect our results but it merits a more detailed investigation in the future as more data on the transport properties of the fibers becomes available note that this feature is another departure from the liu 1989 algorithm but it is similar to a stiffness constraint imposed by stowicka et al 2012 we found that d s m i n 0 36 mm produces fiber behaviors similar to observations and to stowicka et al 2012 including the tumbling of a fiber over itself shown below but with a simpler implementation we emphasize that more rigorous alternatives to this approach exist in schmid and klingenberg 2000 and switzer and klingenberg 2004 and we intend to incorporate these in future versions of the model their extra computational demand is not warranted at the present time again due to a lack of data on the parameters 2 3 simplifications one simplification of this model is that each fiber is assumed to be a mass less 1 d line object in 2 or 3 d space this is not expected to affect the results since fibers are generally neutrally buoyant and the flexibility constraint of section 2 2 is an approximation of some of the effects of having thickness another simplification is the omission of attractive forces between different fibers and between fibers and solids given a model for their interactions these can both be incorporated as additional forces in the simulation between the unconstrained predictor step and the corrector so only one computationally expensive nonlinear iteration is necessary regardless of which are included we expect that the lack of interaction forces between fibers and grains will have an impact on the results but we are unaware of any data on the interaction potentials between mpfs and granular material so the inclusion of any force would be purely speculative at this point however when these data become available robust modeling of these forces including friction can be included following schmid and klingenberg 2000 and switzer and klingenberg 2004 another simplification is that the fibers are assumed to be suspended in clean water with no compounds attached to the surface it is known that mpfs tend to function as hyperaccumulators of metals anderson et al 2016 andrady 2011 and are likely hotspots for their associated reactions both of which could also be included recent particle based methods for simulating solute transport diffusion mass transfer and reactions e g benson and bolster 2017 bolster et al 2015 engdahl et al 2017 can also easily be incorporated into the numerical scheme where diffusion and reaction can be made to occur along individual fibers all of these simplifications are made for simplicity but they are interesting prospects for future work that could bring a high degree of realism to the models however in the absence of more detailed data in these areas we move on to the examples 3 rotational flow example the approach shown here is likely to be unfamiliar to readers so we provide a brief comparison of the brc algorithm and a non constrained random walk rw this example represents fibers spinning in a laminar rotational velocity field such as a slowly stirred container the complete source code needed to reproduce this example is available from the corresponding author note that the discretization of a fiber as a brc can affect the overall magnitude of the diffusive displacements and also advective transport when it is allowed in ways that are different from solute plumes since this subject is peripheral to this example the details of these tradeoffs are discussed in the supplementary information document a simple analytical flow field is assumed that represents the gradual deceleration of a vortex that formed in a stirred container of water with fibers suspended in it the 2 d rotational velocity field centered at the origin uses v v x v y with components given by 10a v x t y ν t ξ 10b v y t x ν t ξ where xν and yν are the coordinates of the νth node of a given fiber and ξ 1 20 is a dimensionless scale factor to attenuate the rotation speed the example uses 10 fibers each of uniform length of 1 5 l and each fiber is discretized into 10 nodes and 9 connecting rods each fiber is initialized as a straight line centered at the origin rotated randomly about its centroid then shifted randomly away from the origin with an offset up to a maximum of x y 1 l giving each fiber a random position away from the center of the vortex and a variety of orientations the first simulation is the brc model without the folding constraint section 2 2 to highlight the intricacies of the rod chain note that tight fiber folding is prevented in the next example the simulation proceeds with δ t 5 0 x 10 2 t up to t 100 t 2000 time steps and the random displacements use d 5 0 10 5 l 2 t 1 the second simulation is an unconstrained random walk and this simply assumes that ϵ ν 0 at all times for all nodes both simulations use the same random seed and consequently the exact same sequence of random displacements all differences between the two are due to the force balance imposed by the constraint equations the initial condition of both systems are shown in fig 1 a and the final states of the brc and unconstrained models are shown in fig 1c and d respectively these visual comparisons highlight the differences between the models and these are quantified more precisely by the fiber lengths over time in fig 1b where the dashed lines are the brc model and the solid lines are the rw model every brc fiber maintains constant length at all times detailed validation of the proposed model is complicated by its stochastic nature but a qualitative validation experiment was conducted in the water resources and environmental laboratory at washington state university fibers were stripped off from a mid weight 200 g m2 fleece cloth via friction while scrubbing the clean dark fleece by hand in clear water then adding the fiber water to a slowly stirred beaker to create a vortex the most notable differences were that the fibers in the beaker could not be made perfectly linear initially and that the angles between nodes in the simulations were sharper than observed in the experiment a result of the discretization of the fibers and the omission of the folding constraint but the general behavior of the two were similar the same basic properties seen in the beaker experiment can also be reproduced by any interested reader simply by rubbing two dark colored clean socks together by hand in a sink with water opening the drain for a short while then closing it as the vortex spins the flow field qualitative validation aside the most important point about the model is that the length of the fibers remains constant fig 1b despite the strong velocity gradients along the fiber caused by the rotational flow field this shows that the force balance is being enforced that slow nodes can be pulled ahead by faster ones and conversely that fast nodes can be dragged by slow nodes 4 fiber mobility through porous media there is a lack of data on the interaction potentials between fibers so rather than offer speculative models for these forces our main example focuses on physical filtration through porous media fibers are fundamentally different than solutes because they are suspended in the fluid but not dissolved in it further the finite length of fibers means that the net motion of the fiber is a product of the velocity distribution along the fiber so a straightforward hypothesis that can be evaluated with the proposed method is that deviations from solute transport will increase as the length of the flexible fibers are increased the porous media selected for this example represents a poorly consolidated deposit such as those formed in alluvial settings or low order fluvial deposits where mpfs are expected to be found since wastewater treatment discharges are often into these settings we assume a mixture of smooth gravel and deterministically define a pore scale geometry based on observations of coarse grained alluvial deposits note that this domain is merely an example and future studies considering smaller grains will be needed to complement this preliminary demonstration the synthetic 2 d porous domain has length 12 cm by 4 cm wide with uniform cell sizes of δ x δ y 0 2 mm and the porosity of this domain is roughly 38 within the granular region fig 2 note that the selected cell size gives 10 cells in the average pore throat which is 2 mm to provide good resolution of the velocity profile the domain intentionally has few dead end pores to compensate for situations where in a fully 3 d domain solutes or fibers might be able to flow around a constriction or pore throat accordingly one might consider this a random obstacle model since it is not a precise reconstruction of 3 d porous media the left and right ends of the domain each have a small open buffer zone of width λ 10 mm between the boundary and the porous grains this gap allows fibers to be placed randomly and at random orientations in this region before being drawn into the domain avoiding some of the complexities of randomly placing non point objects fibers are centered randomly along the vertical axis of the domain and passive particles are also placed along the same plane x 0 5 cm the velocity field for this domain was solved using lattice boltzmann methods following chen and doolen 1998 a d2q9 lattice with a single relaxation factor of unity was used and a specified flux was prescribed for the domain of 25 m d giving an arithmetic mean pore water velocity of about 40 m d for the base flow rate or about 26 m d as the geometric mean this would be a high flow rate in consolidated aquifers but it reasonable for the coarse unconsolidated gravel deposits being depicted fig 2 the diffusion coefficient is d 3 75 10 6 m 2 d 1 the velocity field is fully resolved at the pore scale so no dispersivity factor is needed based on the average velocity and the average pore opening the peclet number is about 24 note that lattice boltzman simulations are scaled representations of flows where the base time unit of the simulation is dictated by the lattice size see chen and doolen 1998 and one lattice time unit here is roughly 7 ms this ensures the low mach number requirements of the lattice boltzmann simulation are satisfied we found that using this time step for the transport simulations ensured rapid convergence of the nonlinear solver for the constraint equations the first simulations were an unconstrained random walk representing the transport of a passive solute through the domain using 1 0 104 particles for simplicity any diffusive displacements into an inactive boundary cell are rejected instead of being reflected since this is a high peclet situation we do not expect this to significantly impact the results particles were released halfway through the buffer zone along a vertical line where they were uniformly randomly distributed fig 2 dotted line and the breakthrough plane is located halfway across the opposite buffer zone fig 2 dashed line the breakthrough curve for the passive tracer is shown in fig 4a c as the black dashed lines for the slow base and fast velocity fields respectively and the time scale of each is normalized by the median breakthrough time τk for that speed note that the slow velocity is half of the base velocity the fast is twice the base velocity and that all three of the passive breakthrough curves are essentially fickian the fiber simulations were conducted by releasing 300 fibers into the domain and a snapshot of one simulation is shown in fig 3 each fiber was assumed to start halfway across the buffer zone but its position vertically was random subject to the constraint that it is entirely within the simulation domain and its orientation was also random here the random displacements use the same diffusion coefficient as the solute however the effectivity diffusivity of a node will be less than this because the diffusive motions are subjected to the constraint forces arrival at the monitoring plane for a fiber was defined by the center of mass of the fiber crossing the breakthrough plane after which the fiber was removed from the simulation the breakthrough curve is defined here as the fraction of fibers that have passed the monitoring plane by convention we normalize fiber breakthrough times by the median breakthrough time of the passive tracer note that breakthrough curves are used here solely to quantify the transport behavior and we make no assumptions or implications about any1 d effective upsacled models for describing fiber mobility the scaling of these results at different breakthrough planes across the domain are shown in the supplementary information for interested readers but the question of upscaled transport equations for fibers is left for future study before proceeding we note that 300 fibers may not seem like a large ensemble compared to most particle tracking studies but recall that each is a discrete object comprised of multiple interacting nodes and this samples more of the velocity field than an individual particle would we found that increasing the number of fibers did not significantly affect the median breakthrough time and only affected the tail so the extra runtime was not necessary for our example simulations which are not presently focused on tailing this convergence analysis is included in the supplemental information section recall also that the fibers do not interact with each other in this simulation so adding more does not affect the behavior of the ensemble although this is a preliminary simplification that will be relaxed as data become available however this leads to the bigger issue of runtime since constraints must be enforced we found that 300 fibers with 12 nodes per fiber took approximately 40x longer to run than 1 0 104 particles using matlab as the computational engine enforcement of the constraint forces comes with a price and this is a tremendous runtime difference but we note that our initial algorithm has not yet been optimized for speed so significant performance gains may be attainable 4 1 fiber length effects the normal length fiber is discretized as 12 nodes and 11 connecting rods a 0 18 mm where the total length of the fiber is initially l 2 0 mm or roughly the same length as the average pore throat short fibers remove 4 nodes moderate fibers add 4 nodes and long fibers add 8 nodes this keeps the discretization of the rod segments constant while changing the fiber length by 33 33 and 66 conceptually think of this as a piece of thread cut to different lengths and only the smallest is smaller than the average pore opening note that the length of the fiber can affect its behavior and this is a complex balance of factors preliminary testing and visual analysis of these lengths showed similar dynamics and deformations in all four cases so for now we adopt the simplest possible approach but this is another area where improvements can be made once more data is available the base case velocity simulation fig 4b clearly shows the hypothesized impact of fiber length on the filtration rate and there is a clear correlation between the two as the fiber length increases each fiber is able to sample more of the velocity field and this exposes each fiber to a more heterogeneous distribution of velocities small fibers are able to align themselves with the local velocity field essentially balancing the high and low velocities around them which is an interesting parallel to the dynamics of the particle ensemble visual inspection of trajectories showed that longer fibers also attempt to do this but they are unable to sustain a favorable orientation over long times the extra length also allows them to wrap around grains see fig 3 where they can spend long times and become trapped even in the absence of electrical or friction forces the short fibers showed little to no retardation relative to the passive tracer and there is a sequential increase in the retardation rate that is related to the ratio of the fiber length to the average pore throat a logical supporting question is what is the role of the mean filtration velocity on fiber mobility two additional sets of simulations were conducted using half the average velocity fig 4a and twice the average velocity fig 4c relative to the base case referred to as the slower and faster cases respectively as one would expect the median breakthrough time of the passive tracers for each of these scaled proportionately to the changes in flux i e twice the flux resulted in breakthrough twice as fast table 1 presents the relative speed of the median breakthrough time for each of the fiber simulations of different length columns delineated by the relative speed of the simulation rows all times are normalized by the median breakthrough time of a passive tracer for each speed the slower simulations exhibited the least retardation the faster simulations experienced the most and in each case the magnitude of the filtration speed was proportionate to the length of the fiber an interesting result is that there was more retardation in the faster case than the slower case we hypothesize that the cause of this is the no slip condition imposed at the fluid grain boundary because regardless of the average fluid speed the velocity at the boundary must go to zero this implies that the same pore throat experiences a higher velocity gradient across it under fast flow than a slow flow this can also be seen from in the classic poiseuille flow profile see stowicka et al 2012 solutes are able to overcome this high velocity contrast because they are independent and are able to transition to different streamlines but the discrete nature of fibers prevents them from doing the same portions of the fiber that are near the boundary cause a sustained drag force on the rest of the fiber that is difficult to overcome a second consequence of the longer length is that it can also cause collapsing of a fiber as it transitions from a fast flow through a throat into the slower pore openings for example consider a case where the leading edge of a fiber is decelerating as the trailing end is still moving fast the net force from the tail can push the fiber into slow regions most solutes would avoid with a momentum like effect another interesting result is seen in the short fiber simulation for the slow velocity field fig 4a because it had a higher median transport rate than the passive tracer this implies that shorter fibers are able to bypass slow regions fibers that are significantly shorter than the pore throats are able to orient themselves parallel to the faster velocities where they sample less of the velocity heterogeneity consequently they are less likely than long fibers to be pushed into slow regions and tend to get caught around grain surfaces less frequently the supplementary information contains a plot showing specific fiber trajectories and also a time series animation of the left edge of the domain to help readers better visualize these behaviors naturally further research into these processes is necessary to better understand the relationships between fiber size pore openings and different distributions of grain sizes and fiber lengths we expect that a combination of experimentally determined trajectories and the proposed numerical framework will provide a powerful hypothesis testing tool for understanding the transport of these large colloids 5 discussion the results here are complementary to some of the previous work using bead rod chain models most notably the work of stowicka et al 2012 who considered the motion of elastic fibers in a poiseuille flow and observed many of the same flipping and rotating behaviors lamura and winkler 2015 also considered polymer chains and investigated some of their dynamics properties in uniform and shear flows and moghani and khomami 2017 used similar techniques to evaluate hydrodynamic interactions of macromolecules other related work has been done in the area of rheology considering the influence of deformable stretching polymers on fluids e g doyle et al 1997 winkler et al 2014 but the present study is the first to our knowledge to consider discrete fiber mobility in porous media our example simulations show that fiber transport may behave like solutes when the lengths of the fibers is on the order of or smaller than the mean pore size but the role of electrical and surface interactions needs to be investigated in detail presently there is no data on the interaction potentials but we are learning from ongoing laboratory experiments that the fraction of fibers that will be trapped in porous media is higher than seen here since these are preliminary simulations that are meant to highlight a novel numerical tool we caution the reader that the mobility of the fibers seen here is likely greater than reality because rough grain edges flocculation friction and electrical interactions all lead to trapping it is possible to include these factors see derksen 2010 schmid and klingenberg 2000 switzer and klingenberg 2004 with a significant increase in computational cost but the lack of data led us to omit them for simplicity in this demonstration allowing us to focus on the first order differences between the transport of infinitesimal solutes and finite flexible fibers objects the main point of this article is that simulation of flexible fiber transport is more complicated than solute transport both operationally and in the kinds of transport behaviors that are exhibited but doing so mechanistically is tractable in realistic porous domains at the scale of the fluid continuum the main operational concerns are the high computational demand required to enforce the various constraints these include at a minimum a fixed length for the bead rod chains and may also include constraints that prevent twisting and folding of fibers onto themselves the limited folding constraint imposed here require knowing the distances between all nodes on a single fiber not just the nearest neighbors but this is only a moderate computational increase when the number of nodes is small direct simulation of fiber interaction forces will also require knowing the distances between every node of every fiber and consideration of surface interactions requires knowing the distances to every surface adding significant computational burden many of these challenges are similar to those recently encountered in particle based simulations of solute transport where efficient search algorithms must be employed e g benson and bolster 2017 bolster et al 2015 but the simple fact is that this level of realism comes with a high computational cost benson et al 2017 and every additional process will also have a cost however a physically based simulation tool with the ability to add these features is crucial for exploring how to most efficiently upscale fiber transport behaviors and the animation and trajectories included with the supplementary information will help the reader see these behaviors more clearly our intent is to combine this numerical hypothesis testing platform with direct observations of fiber mobility including detailed trajectories from future laboratory experiments to validate revise and refine our knowledge of the dynamics of large fiber like colloids supplementary material supplementary material associated with this article can be

758,hydrologic persistence plays an important role in natural mechanisms governing hydrologic processes and their interdependence the spatio temporal evolution of persistence in rainfall and streamflow and their joint behaviour is examined here through the estimation of hurst coefficient using detrended fluctuation analysis dfa and detrended cross correlation analysis dcca the mopex model parameter estimation project watersheds in usa and the cauvery river basin in india are used as case studies the analyses show that the temporal dynamics of the persistence of rainfall and streamflow and their joint behaviour are non uniform across different time scales it is found that the contribution of catchment processes influencing the persistence of the streamflow is a function of the catchment area the state of persistence of joint behaviour is neither dependent on the rainfall amount nor affected by the changing patterns of dry and wet spells whereas the persistence of rainfall alone is affected by the latter keywords persistence multiscale rainfall streamflow hurst coefficient 1 introduction persistence is a fundamental characteristic of hydrologic processes kantelhardt et al 2006 koscielny bunde et al 2006 zhang et al 2008 understanding the role of persistence is vital to the development of hydrological models it influences the inter arrival times of extreme and rare events and also helps in understanding the underlying mechanism of their return periods bunde et al 2003 bunde et al 2004 bunde et al 2005 lennartz et al 2008 this understanding has implications for several practical applications in designing the infrastructure the seminal work of hurst 1951 introduced the concept of persistence in hydrological processes and showed persistence in the record of flows of the nile river since then a wide range of research has been undertaken for the identification of persistence across a variety of disciplines ranging from climate bunde et al 2001 blender and fraedrich 2003 rybski et al 2006 kumar et al 2013 to physiology peng et al 1993 1995 bunde et al 2000 and several other disciplines the hydrologic cycle comprises of processes that are highly complex and non linear in nature and they exhibit different degrees of interactions among themselves across space and time scales blöschl and sivapalan 1995 as a result the degree of persistence indicated by positive persistence anti persistence or white noise in processes and their mutual interactions also vary in space and time scales a challenge in understanding the rainfall streamflow transformations is the manifestation of the short term persistence in rainfall in the comparatively long term persistence in streamflow under the influence of both rainfall and the catchment characteristics rainfall a short memory process interacts with a large number of catchment processes soil moisture groundwater surface water interaction snowmelt etc and characteristics such as drainage networks and finally yields the comparatively higher persistence in streamflow a number of studies have dealt with the identification and quantification of persistence in hydrology labat et al 2011 telesca et al 2011 li et al 2015 however very few studies have explored the long term persistence of hydrological processes as related to the hydro meteorological and catchment related characteristics szolgayova et al 2013 studied the relationship of long range dependence with different hydro meteorological characteristics like mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation mean discharge and specific mean discharge and catchment characteristics like catchment area and mean elevation they also considered the characteristics of time series data like seasonality index and length of time series for the european rivers they found that the hurst coefficient h is positively correlated with catchment area mean discharge and air temperature and negatively correlated with mean specific discharge and seasonality index also no significant correlation was observed with the length of time series mudelsee 2007 studied the long memory properties of runoff of six european american and african rivers and concluded that the river network plays a major role in the long memory of runoff by aggregating the short term memory of precipitation this study also revealed that larger catchments have a longer memory than the smaller catchments hirpa et al 2010 questioned the long memory of runoff studied by mudelsee 2007 and suggested that different climate and landscape may have impacted the study findings they focussed on a single watershed of flint river in georgia and analysed the dependency of the watershed area on the long term persistence behaviour of runoff finally they concluded that the long term persistence in runoff is a function of catchment area irrespective of the climate and landscape factors in contrast to their original suggestion various other studies have examined the multiple temporal scale behaviour of rainfall fraedrich and larnder 1993 pelletier and turcotte 1997 iliopoulou et al 2017 matsoukas et al 2000 concluded that the pattern of alternating dry and wet spells not the actual intensities of rainfall control the long term correlation structure of rainfall kantelhardt et al 2006 suggested that the persistence in runoff is dependent on the intermittent behaviour of rainfall and the processes related to soil water storage studies have also reflected on the influence of anthropogenic activities on long term persistence of streamflow jovanovic et al 2016 investigated the influence of urbanization on long term persistence of streamflow and found that the long term persistence estimated h is a function of the percentage of impervious cover in a watershed they found that persistence of flows from more impervious areas more than 25 of the area of the watershed is generally lower than less impervious areas less than 10 of the area they further explain the loss of long term persistence in highly impervious areas due to the combined influence of impervious surfaces and conventional storm water infrastructure lian et al 2016 analysed the long term persistence in comparison to naturally occurring flow and dam induced flow in china they found that dam induced flows exhibit increased long memory and reduction in flow fluctuations due to the combined influence of watershed area as well as the smoothening effect of the dam operations looking at the various study findings from literature it is seen that the persistence in streamflow in catchments with least human influence is primarily governed by two major factors 1 catchment characteristics such as catchment area degree of river networks state of soil water storage that contributes to the partitioning of rainfall to streamflow and evapotranspiration and also the groundwater surface water interaction 2 precipitation characteristics such as sequences of dry and wet spell characteristics that control the persistence in rainfall which then through the various catchment processes translates to long term persistence in streamflow while the above discussions have brought to fore the various influencers of persistence in streamflow and rainfall the focus has to move from a single variable to a multi variable domain to make the analysis of persistence more realistic studying more than one variable in the context of persistence may reveal interesting insights in the processes behaviour and their interactions across different spatial and temporal scales furthermore the temporal evolution of the persistence of the processes and their interactions is still a topic for further enquiry this can give insights about the underlying dynamics that controls their degree of persistence at different time scales another important aspect in context to the persistence of streamflow is the form of precipitation i e fraction of precipitation falling as snow fs which provides persistent flows during dry periods in this study the following research issues based on the aforementioned discussion are explored a temporal evolution of the persistence of rainfall streamflow and their joint behaviour across multiple spatial scales b effect of rainfall amount on the cross correlation structure of rainfall and streamflow c effect of catchment area on the cross correlation structure of rainfall and streamflow and d influence of changing patterns of dry and wet spells on the cross correlation behaviour on catchments with varying degree of fs the following sections in the paper delineate these study objectives methodology analyses and discussion of the results in section 2 details of the methodologies used to address the above objectives are presented along with the details of the study area and the data used in the study for this study we have selected catchments from cauvery river basin in india and mopex watersheds in usa the results are analysed in section 3 where suitable numerical experiments are discussed first and their results are elaborated finally the conclusions of the study are presented along with limitations of the study in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used for the purpose of the study the watersheds from united states and from southern india are selected to examine the persistence in different climatological settings the cauvery river basin fig 1 of southern india is bounded between 75 27 to 79 54 e and 10 9 to 13 30 n with a total surface area of 85 155 sq km which is around 2 7 of the total geographical area of the country the cauvery river is one of the major rivers of peninsular india which flows eastward through the indian states of kerala karnataka tamil nadu and the union territory of puducherry to meet the bay of bengal the river basin experiences both tropical and sub tropical climatic conditions the major part of the basin is covered by agricultural land 67 of the total area and as a result of this large number of water storage structures reservoirs and dams have been constructed to meet the demand for water primarily for agriculture during the dry season due to this human intervention the flows at the downstream of the structures are expected to be influenced by the regulation for the purpose of the analysis the natural streamflow records from ten gauging stations are selected with no major structural interventions upstream the selected gauging stations and their corresponding basins have the least influence of human interventions the location details of the gauging stations and their contributing sub catchment areas are provided in table a 1 in appendix a the daily streamflow data is obtained from india wris database www india wris nrsc gov in the contemporaneous daily precipitation datasets are extracted from imd india meteorological department database with a spatial resolution of 0 25ᵒ 0 25ᵒ which are interpolated from the station data pai et al 2014 the grids for the cauvery river basins are extracted from the imd gridded datasets and simple averaging was done to represent the rainfall over a particular sub catchment based on the number of grids falling within the sub catchment there is no contribution of snowfall in this basin in order to study the influence of fraction of snowfall contribution fs on the persistence of streamflow the watersheds from mopex model parameter estimation project datasets ftp hydrology nws noaa gov pub gcip mopex us data us 438 daily have been selected schaake et al 2006 the mopex datasets consist of time series of precipitation streamflow potential evapotranspiration and maximum and minimum temperature based on the work of berghuijs et al 2014 90 watersheds fig 2 and table a 2 in appendix a from mopex database have been selected on the basis of fraction of precipitation fs contributed from snow these watersheds are classified into three categories namely watersheds with fs equal to 0 fs less than 0 15 and fs greater than 0 5 based on study conducted by berghuijs et al 2014 the degree of fs influences the persistence characteristics of streamflow in each of the watersheds 2 2 methodology traditionally the persistence in hydrologic variables is estimated using auto correlation function of series such that the persistence decays with time by power law for example let ri be daily streamflow observed at any gauging station where i i 1 2 n denotes the number of days of observations and r i be the mean value in order to remove the seasonal trends as it affects the estimation process a series of anomalies ψ is considered as 1 ψ i r i r i the auto correlation function is defined as 2 c s ψ i ψ i s s γ 0 γ 1 where denotes the average of all pairs with time lag s the auto correlation function c s is highly influenced by the presence of trend in the time series also it becomes highly unstable due to small length of the records common in most of hydrologic time series kantelhardt et al 2006 in order to overcome these limitations the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa although debated bryce and sprague 2012 höll and kantz 2015 is one of the commonly used methods applied in this analysis bunde et al 2000 hajian and movahed 2010 ludescher et al 2017 traditional data processing methods may not be the best choice as they will be unable to reduce the effects of non stationary factors which are manifested by trends and noise which may affect the persistence the presence of seasonality in the time series poses problems in evaluating persistence and thus it must be removed prior to further analysis in this analysis it is assumed that the trend is linear and it is removed by the by polynomial detrending of suitable order 2 similar to dfa in order to analyse the joint behaviour of persistence of two variables e g rainfall and streamflow through the investigation of power law cross correlation detrended cross correlation analysis dcca is used dcca was first introduced by podobnik and stanley 2008 at different temporal scales the degree of influence of rainfall and catchment processes on the persistence of streamflow is non uniform in order to capture the state of persistence at different time scales multiple temporal windows are selected fig 3 the temporal scales are selected as seasonal annual and larger time scales to identify the signatures in the joint behaviour of persistence of streamflow and rainfall across catchments of different area as well as different fraction of precipitation falling as snow the algorithms describing the dfa and dcca are given in the appendices b 1 and b 2 respectively the flowchart showing the methodology used in the study is given in fig 3 the h and λ are the univariate and bivariate counterparts of hurst coefficient estimated through dfa and dcca respectively this approach helps to explore the temporal evolution of persistence dynamics through the determination of hurst coefficient and also the coupled behaviour across multi temporal scales the data used for the analysis is at daily time resolution and the multi temporal estimates of hurst coefficient are obtained for time scales ranging from 100 to 1000 days such an analysis has direct application in case of hydrological droughts typically manifested by the combined influence of low rainfall and streamflow in the following paragraphs the details of the numerical experiments used for addressing the proposed objectives are discussed the cross correlation structure reveals the mutual influence of rainfall and streamflow and it is important to study the joint influence to understand the dynamics of their persistence across the different temporal scales in particular the observed rainfall time series can be realized as a series comprising of both dry and wet spells to examine whether the magnitude of rainfall amounts have any impact on cross correlation structure a numerical experiment is designed as follows the mean and the standard deviation of the observed rainfall time series are preserved and are used to simulate normally distributed random numbers the non zero rainfall values of the observed rainfall time series are replaced with the random numbers thus generated and the series is referred as reconstructed time series the hurst coefficient of the cross correlation at different temporal scales is computed as described in the flowchart fig 3 considering the reconstructed rainfall time series and the observed streamflow time series if the difference in the hurst coefficient of this new series and that of the observed series is less than 0 5 then it can be concluded that the rainfall amount has no role in the cross correlation structure matsoukas et al 2000 if however the difference is more than 0 5 it would mean that the state of persistence is altered and thus the rainfall amount will influence the dynamics of the cross correlation structure in the above numerical experiment reconstructed time series of rainfall is used to assess the persistence behaviour of cross correlation of the rainfall and streamflow the streamflow time series used in this numerical experiment is the observed series this could spark a question on whether the results will be affected if the corresponding streamflow resulting from the reconstructed rainfall time series is used a major hypothesis is that whatever be the magnitude of rainfall in the reconstructed rainfall time series the state of persistence of corresponding streamflow will be the same as the observed state of persistence of streamflow in order to check the accuracy of this claim a multiple linear regression model is formulated and used for simulating the streamflow using reconstructed rainfall time series for analysing the state of persistence in this new set up the steps described in fig 3 are used the results and discussion of this numerical experiment and are discussed in section 3 2 to understand the role of catchment size on the persistence characteristics of streamflow another numerical experiment is designed utilizing the fact that an observed time series of rainfall can be considered as a sequence of dry and wet periods a binary series of rainfall is constructed by replacing all non zero elements in rainfall series with numeric ones 1 s and keeping the zeros intact then the analysis as described in fig 3 for the estimation of cross correlation between the observed streamflow and binary rainfall series are carried out if the value of the hurst coefficient obtained from the binary series λ2 is the same as that of the original cross correlation structure λ1 then it is evident that the catchments contribute equally to the persistence of the observed cross correlation otherwise the difference between λ 1 and λ 2 can be used as an indicator to infer about the contribution of catchment area in terms of the state of catchment processes to the persistence of streamflow the results and discussion on the numerical experiments described in this paragraph are provided in section 3 3 the final numerical experiment is set up to understand how the changes in the observed patterns of spells affect the joint persistence of rainfall and streamflow to understand this a numerical experiment using the binary series of rainfall consisting simply of rainy and non rainy days is performed in the experiment the number of rainy days number of ones in binary rainfall dataset in a year are fixed and randomly shuffled across the series and applied the same method i e dcca to obtain the cross covariance structure the analysis and results of this numerical experiment is discussed section 3 4 in the next section the results of the experiments described above are discussed 3 results and discussions 3 1 temporal evolution of the hurst coefficient of rainfall streamflow and their cross correlation structure across multiple temporal scales in fig 4 the plots of the log transformations of fluctuation function and time scales are shown for both dfa and dcca respectively the slope of the plots for subsets corresponding to different time scales as mentioned in the fig 3 will give the estimate of hurst coefficient for individual rainfall and streamflow time series using dfa and their joint behaviour using dcca in fig 5 the temporal evolution of the persistence of rainfall and the streamflow in the cauvery river basin is presented which exhibits quite a few distinct characteristics it is observed that the persistence of streamflow green curve is always more than that of the rainfall the streamflow is a smoothened process and thus exhibits a longer persistence kantelhardt et al 2006 this happens due to the rainfall process characterised by weak persistence interacting with the landscape characteristics such as the channel networks status of soil moisture interaction with groundwater and related catchment processes to generate streamflow the persistence in rainfall black curve is lower than that of streamflow as it exhibits high variability in intensity and duration across the space and time scales the temporal evolution of persistence through the dynamic behaviour of hurst coefficient across time scales can be visualized in the figure understanding the temporal evolution of persistence helps greatly in the exploration of the underlying dynamics and the interaction with other processes that govern the variable of interest the red curve denotes the joint behaviour of rainfall and streamflow in terms of persistence across multiple time scales through dcca one of the characteristics of the cross correlation structure is that it is varying across time scales which signifies that the degree of persistence in streamflow which is explained by rainfall as well as catchment related characteristics is not constant across multiple time scales the temporal evolution of the cross correlation structure is one of the important properties to be understood the dynamic behaviour of the cross correlation structure comprises of the effect of persistence of rainfall characteristics and contribution of catchment processes in fig 6 the temporal evolution of hurst coefficient as a function of fs across mopex watersheds are shown a similar behaviour of dynamics of hurst coefficient across different spatial scales catchments of different areas is observed both in the case of cauvery basin and the mopex watersheds where there is no contribution of snow fs 0 00 for watersheds with fs more than 0 5 it is found that at all temporal scales the values of the dynamic hurst coefficient for streamflow is more than 1 0 which suggests that the streamflow does not exhibit power law behaviour also in the watersheds where fs values are less than 0 15 the dynamic hurst coefficient for streamflow shows variability across both temporal and spatial scales from these observations it can be concluded that due to the combined influence of watershed area and fs the streamflow deviates from the power law behaviour across temporal scales apart from the temporal evolution of hurst coefficient across multiple time scales it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the persistence between rainfall and streamflow in a given time scale across all watersheds generally the watersheds are highly heterogeneous in terms of land use land cover soil characteristics state of soil moisture etc which significantly influence the state of persistence of streamflow in a region these characteristics play an important role in rainfall runoff transformations at a variety of space and temporal scales and thus influence the state and magnitude of persistence according to blöschl and sivapalan 1995 the flow response at event scale is primarily controlled by the storm and basin characteristics at annual scale streamflow is governed by periodicity of rainfall evapotranspiration and snowmelt even at longer time scales the effects of long term variability of rainfall and climate geomorphologic processes and anthropogenic activities influence the streamflow regime pelletier and turcotte 1997 as a result the state as well as magnitude as measured by λ of joint persistence among rainfall and streamflow will exhibit different degrees at multiple temporal scales in fig 7 the variation of the joint persistence of streamflow and rainfall across multiple temporal scales for cauvery river basin and mopex watersheds of different degree of fs are shown it is evident that there is a negative correlation between the mean hurst coefficient across all catchments and the temporal scales this suggests that different controlling factors are predominant at different temporal scales that govern the persistence of streamflow rather than only rainfall i e the state of the catchment characteristics plays a dominant role in the evolution of persistence of streamflow for most of the catchments of cauvery river as well as mopex watersheds with fs 0 00 and fs 0 15 there exists a negative correlation consistently at different time scales the mopex watersheds with fs 0 50 shows positive correlation this can be attributed to slow and steady processes of snowmelt give rise to gradual increase in streamflow from these analyses it is evident that the runoff generation mechanism and the state of the catchment characteristics play a major role in the evolution of persistence in streamflow 3 2 effect of the rainfall amounts on the cross correlation structure of rainfall and streamflow the hurst coefficient obtained by performing dcca reveals the influence of the rainfall patterns and characteristics of the state of the catchment processes on the state of persistence of the streamflow the results presented in this section are based on the experiments designed in section 2 2 which consist of two parts in the first part of this section the influence of the rainfall amount on the cross correlation structure is investigated the analysis is performed over all of mopex catchments irrespective of fs and the cauvery river basin the second part of the discussion is related to examining whether the state of persistence of streamflow is affected if the magnitude of the rainfall is changed the boxplots in figs 8 a b and 9 represent the difference between the dynamic hurst coefficients of cross correlation for the two series of rainfall observed and reconstructed series with the observed streamflow series for mopex watersheds and cauvery river basin respectively it is clear that the differences are well under 0 5 the scatter plots in the figures represent the overall difference which is the difference of hurst coefficients of cross correlation structure of reconstructed and observed rainfall dataset with the observed streamflow without considering the dynamic time scales it is observed that this difference is also well under 0 5 from these observations it is evident that the at all temporal scales the amount of rainfall has no influence on the state of persistence of the cross correlation structure of streamflow and rainfall at watersheds irrespective of form of precipitation and size of watershed based on the discussions in section 2 2 to investigate whether changing the rainfall magnitude as in the reconstructed rainfall time series will have any influence on the state of persistence of streamflow a multiple regression model is formed with rainfall r mean temperature t and potential evapotranspiration pe as covariates to explain the observed streamflow f in one of the watersheds the data used for the analysis is taken from mopex dataset for usgs site id 1 606 500 schaake et al 2006 the regression model is of the form f 0 116171 r 0 181760 pe 0 091701 t 1 83 with multiple r 2 0 1207 the model constructed is found to be useful when tested for the hypothesis of non zero model parameters using f test with resulting p value 2 2 10 16 using this model synthetic streamflow is generated with the reconstructed rainfall time series keeping other variables same as observed the results are shown in fig 10 from the figure it can be seen that the state of persistence of rainfall streamflow and their cross correlation structure do not change even after replacing the actual non zero rainfall values with random numbers this indicates that the magnitude of the rainfall has no effect on its own state of persistence as well as the joint persistence of rainfall and streamflow this suggests that the state of the catchment processes that governs the runoff generation mechanism plays a major role in the dynamics of the persistence characteristics of streamflow in the next section how this effect is attributed to the persistence of streamflow as a function of catchment area is discussed 3 3 effect of the catchment area on the cross correlation structure of rainfall and streamflow kantelhardt et al 2006 suggested that the persistence of streamflow can be partially explained by the persistence in rainfall through its intermittent patterns and that storage of water in soil and river networks mudelsee 2007 which is the function of catchment area dominates the persistence of the streamflow the persistence structure of cross correlation between rainfall and streamflow is affected mostly by catchment related characteristics which can be assume to be a function of the catchment area and slightly by the persistence of rainfall in view of this suggestion the question of how the size of catchment influences the cross correlation structure is explored to address this question a binary series of rainfall i e series consisting of rainy and non rainy days is constructed as described in section 2 2 and the method described in fig 3 is used to infer about the results of the numerical experiment this numerical experiment may have far reaching implications there exists a systematic difference among the hurst coefficients as a function of the catchment area the degree of departure of cross correlation structures defined by the binary series of rainfall from the original series to the observed streamflow reveals the contribution of the catchment processes which is the function of catchment area influencing the persistence in streamflow different catchment related characteristics such as state of soil moisture land use land cover etc may have dominant effect on the joint persistence structure of rainfall and streamflow at different temporal scales in comparison to the persistence characteristics of observed rainfall in figs 11 and 12 the departure of the cross correlation structure as difference between λ1 and λ2 is presented as a function of the catchment area it can be observed that there exists a large variability in the difference across spatial scales which is due to the variability in the different catchment processes contributing towards persistence of streamflow for fs 0 15 and fs 0 00 there are 60 and 16 watersheds respectively showing a significant relationship p value 0 05 between the contribution of the catchment processes to persistence in streamflow and the catchment area in the mopex watersheds with fs 0 50 and the cauvery river basin a positive association is found but it is not significant p value 0 05 as it was in the previous case due to sampling variability as p value is a function of sample size therefore it can be concluded that larger the catchment size the more is the influence of its characteristics on the persistence of streamflow resulting in higher differences between λ1 and λ2 3 4 effect of changing patterns of dry and wet spells on cross correlation between rainfall and streamflow in previous sections the evolution of the persistence behaviour of rainfall streamflow and their joint dynamics are discussed from different perspectives starting from the state of the catchment related processes to the patterns of rainfall in this section the influence of the changing patterns of rainfall on the state of persistence of joint behaviour and the state of persistence of rainfall alone is studied for that purpose the numerical experiment described in section 2 2 is followed the results are presented in figs 13 and 14 for the mopex watersheds and cauvery river basin respectively there are two findings observed in these plots first the state of persistence of rainfall is dramatically affected by the changing patterns of dry and wet spells of the observed rainfall time series after shuffling the patterns of the dry and the wet spells the multi temporal persistence across different time scales is observed to be very close to 0 5 which suggests that the state of persistence of rainfall approaches the state of white noise secondly the state of persistence of the joint behaviour of the streamflow and rainfall is unaffected by the changing patterns of the dry and wet spells for all the catchments irrespective of time scales and the degree of precipitation falling as snow fs 4 conclusions in this paper the temporal dynamics of the persistence of streamflow rainfall and their joint behaviour through cross correlation analysis is explored through the estimation hurst coefficient using dfa and dcca respectively the mopex basins usa with varying degrees of fraction of precipitation falling as snow as well as the cauvery river basin from southern peninsular india with no snowfall contribution are considered for the study it is observed that the degree of persistence is different at different time scales for their cross correlation as well as individually for rainfall and streamflow the behaviour of the persistence of cross correlation is explained as a function of the catchment area as well as at different temporal scales to discern the different controlling factors of rainfall runoff transformation the major conclusions that are derived from the study are as follows 1 the degree of persistence of rainfall and streamflow and their joint behaviour shows a dynamic evolution across temporal scales by analysing the cross correlation the dependence of streamflow persistence on rainfall is not uniform across temporal scales also the persistence is influenced by both rainfall patterns and catchment processes that contribute to the persistence of streamflow at different time scales 2 the state of persistence of cross correlation structure between rainfall and streamflow across the different time scales as well as spatial scales are not controlled by the amount of rainfall observed 3 the contribution of the catchment related processes to the persistence of the streamflow increases with the increasing catchment area although there could exist variability due to the sample size this finding is similar to that of hirpa et al 2010 even though they did not separate out the influence of patterns of dry and wet spells of rainfall from the persistence structure of streamflow the combined influence of catchment area as well as fraction of snowfall contribution fs is responsible for the deviation from power law behaviour in case of streamflow it is observed that with fs 0 50 streamflow deviates from power law behaviour across all spatial and temporal scales 4 the importance of the actual patterns of dry and wet spells on cross correlation structure is also explored in this study by changing the number of days between the two consecutive wet spells keeping the number of rainy days constant in a year the state of persistence of the cross correlation between rainfall and streamflow is not affected across all spatial and temporal scales whereas the state of persistence of rainfall is severely affected by the changing patterns of the observed dry and wet spells which approaches the border of the state of positive and anti persistence a major application of this study can be in the field of drought hazard assessment which has implications for agricultural production and water management inclusion of the concept of joint persistence in the modelling the return periods of droughts will have far reaching applications in prediction of drought characteristics extreme events such as hydrological droughts are manifested by combined influence of low rainfall and streamflow and thus investigating their joint persistence behaviour at multiple scales will help in better understanding the mechanism of the recurrence time of droughts pelletier and turcotte 1997 showed that using autoregressive models overestimate the recurrence interval of drought by significant amount as there is no room for preserving the persistence in the simple autoregressive models large scale climate oscillation such as el niño southern oscillation enso also influences global and regional hydrological processes ausloos et al 2017 interpreted the dynamics of hurst coefficient in relation with el niño and north atlantic oscillation nao while examining the persistence properties of paglia river in central italy it is to be noted that in the analysis the catchment related processes that contribute to the persistence in streamflow are assumed to be lumped the catchment processes such as soil moisture dynamics groundwater surface water interactions land use land cover influence etc that contribute to persistence of streamflow can be used in the future studies to explore the contributions of the processes to streamflow persistence although in this study the watersheds with varying degree of fs and semi arid basin are explored the same framework can be further used to understand patterns in some extreme environments like catchments in arid environments or rapidly urbanizing environments this would give an idea about what other processes influence

as ranged scale analysis r s analysis and periodogram regression which are used for analysing persistence in time series detrended fluctuation analysis is used in this study it is preferred because the estimates obtained through this method are not sensitive to the non stationary characteristics of time series hajian and movahed 2010 and it works well for time series with finite samples ludescher et al 2017 the algorithm of detrended fluctuation analysis is presented below let xk denote a time series which may be of daily rainfall or streamflow in the present analysis after removing the seasonal component from the time series by subtracting the inter annual mean from each daily value the series yk is composed of trend component and noise step 1 calculate profile for the time series b 1 y i k 1 i y k for i 1 2 n step 2 divide the profile y i into n s n s non overlapping segments of equal lengths s as the record length n need not be a multiple of segment length s there will be certain part of the data which always remains outside the non overlapping segments therefore to bring the remaining part of the dataset in the same procedure is repeated from the end of the series thus there are 2ns number of segments step 3 in this step the local trends for each segment s are calculated by fitting a polynomial of degree n therefore the detrended series ys by removing the polynomial fits from the de seasonalised time series data in each segment b 2 y s i y i p v i where v 1 2 2ns in this analysis quadratic polynomial function have been fitted which will remove first

scaling coefficient of the fluctuation function f s can be estimated from linear regression of f s vs s in a log log plane as b 5 f s s h q where h q is the generalized hurst coefficient and in this analysis h q is confined at q 2 the scaling coefficient h q 2 the second order moment is identical to the hurst coefficient h 0 5 h q 2 1 denotes the presence of positive persistence in the time series whereas 0 h q 2 0 5 shows the presence of anti persistence h q 2 1 indicates that the series is correlated but does not exhibit power law behaviour hirpa et al 2010 b 2 detrended cross correlation analysis there could be situations when it is necessary to explore the influence of the fluctuations of one variable on the other this will enable us to understand how persistence in one variable affects the persistence in the other variable understanding this dependence structure helps us to explore a variety of scenarios in the driving variable and how it influences the target variable across both space and time scales to explore all these possibilities the detrended cross correlation analysis is performed as follows consider two time series xk and yk for k 1 2 n both the series are de seasonalised in order to remove the seasonal component by the approach discussed in section 3 1 let xk and yk denote the de seasonalised series the steps for the detrended cross correlation analysis are as follows step 1 the profile x i and y i for the series xk and yk are calculated as follows b 6 x i k 1 i x k b 7 y i k 1 i y k for all i 1 2 n step 2 division of each of the profile to n s n s non overlapping segments of equal length s is done and the fluctuation functions for each segments are computed as there are 2ns segments first the fluctuation function is computed up to ns segments and then from ns 1 to 2ns the computations of the fluctuation functions are as follows b 8 f s m 1 s i 1 s y m 1 s i y m i x m 1 s i x m i for m 1 2 ns and b 9 f s m 1 s i 1 s y n m

increase decrease in value of the one variable flows decrease increase in the value of the other λ 0 5 denotes they are un correlated dutta et al 2014 appendix c fig c 1 and fig c 2 
758,hydrologic persistence plays an important role in natural mechanisms governing hydrologic processes and their interdependence the spatio temporal evolution of persistence in rainfall and streamflow and their joint behaviour is examined here through the estimation of hurst coefficient using detrended fluctuation analysis dfa and detrended cross correlation analysis dcca the mopex model parameter estimation project watersheds in usa and the cauvery river basin in india are used as case studies the analyses show that the temporal dynamics of the persistence of rainfall and streamflow and their joint behaviour are non uniform across different time scales it is found that the contribution of catchment processes influencing the persistence of the streamflow is a function of the catchment area the state of persistence of joint behaviour is neither dependent on the rainfall amount nor affected by the changing patterns of dry and wet spells whereas the persistence of rainfall alone is affected by the latter keywords persistence multiscale rainfall streamflow hurst coefficient 1 introduction persistence is a fundamental characteristic of hydrologic processes kantelhardt et al 2006 koscielny bunde et al 2006 zhang et al 2008 understanding the role of persistence is vital to the development of hydrological models it influences the inter arrival times of extreme and rare events and also helps in understanding the underlying mechanism of their return periods bunde et al 2003 bunde et al 2004 bunde et al 2005 lennartz et al 2008 this understanding has implications for several practical applications in designing the infrastructure the seminal work of hurst 1951 introduced the concept of persistence in hydrological processes and showed persistence in the record of flows of the nile river since then a wide range of research has been undertaken for the identification of persistence across a variety of disciplines ranging from climate bunde et al 2001 blender and fraedrich 2003 rybski et al 2006 kumar et al 2013 to physiology peng et al 1993 1995 bunde et al 2000 and several other disciplines the hydrologic cycle comprises of processes that are highly complex and non linear in nature and they exhibit different degrees of interactions among themselves across space and time scales blöschl and sivapalan 1995 as a result the degree of persistence indicated by positive persistence anti persistence or white noise in processes and their mutual interactions also vary in space and time scales a challenge in understanding the rainfall streamflow transformations is the manifestation of the short term persistence in rainfall in the comparatively long term persistence in streamflow under the influence of both rainfall and the catchment characteristics rainfall a short memory process interacts with a large number of catchment processes soil moisture groundwater surface water interaction snowmelt etc and characteristics such as drainage networks and finally yields the comparatively higher persistence in streamflow a number of studies have dealt with the identification and quantification of persistence in hydrology labat et al 2011 telesca et al 2011 li et al 2015 however very few studies have explored the long term persistence of hydrological processes as related to the hydro meteorological and catchment related characteristics szolgayova et al 2013 studied the relationship of long range dependence with different hydro meteorological characteristics like mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation mean discharge and specific mean discharge and catchment characteristics like catchment area and mean elevation they also considered the characteristics of time series data like seasonality index and length of time series for the european rivers they found that the hurst coefficient h is positively correlated with catchment area mean discharge and air temperature and negatively correlated with mean specific discharge and seasonality index also no significant correlation was observed with the length of time series mudelsee 2007 studied the long memory properties of runoff of six european american and african rivers and concluded that the river network plays a major role in the long memory of runoff by aggregating the short term memory of precipitation this study also revealed that larger catchments have a longer memory than the smaller catchments hirpa et al 2010 questioned the long memory of runoff studied by mudelsee 2007 and suggested that different climate and landscape may have impacted the study findings they focussed on a single watershed of flint river in georgia and analysed the dependency of the watershed area on the long term persistence behaviour of runoff finally they concluded that the long term persistence in runoff is a function of catchment area irrespective of the climate and landscape factors in contrast to their original suggestion various other studies have examined the multiple temporal scale behaviour of rainfall fraedrich and larnder 1993 pelletier and turcotte 1997 iliopoulou et al 2017 matsoukas et al 2000 concluded that the pattern of alternating dry and wet spells not the actual intensities of rainfall control the long term correlation structure of rainfall kantelhardt et al 2006 suggested that the persistence in runoff is dependent on the intermittent behaviour of rainfall and the processes related to soil water storage studies have also reflected on the influence of anthropogenic activities on long term persistence of streamflow jovanovic et al 2016 investigated the influence of urbanization on long term persistence of streamflow and found that the long term persistence estimated h is a function of the percentage of impervious cover in a watershed they found that persistence of flows from more impervious areas more than 25 of the area of the watershed is generally lower than less impervious areas less than 10 of the area they further explain the loss of long term persistence in highly impervious areas due to the combined influence of impervious surfaces and conventional storm water infrastructure lian et al 2016 analysed the long term persistence in comparison to naturally occurring flow and dam induced flow in china they found that dam induced flows exhibit increased long memory and reduction in flow fluctuations due to the combined influence of watershed area as well as the smoothening effect of the dam operations looking at the various study findings from literature it is seen that the persistence in streamflow in catchments with least human influence is primarily governed by two major factors 1 catchment characteristics such as catchment area degree of river networks state of soil water storage that contributes to the partitioning of rainfall to streamflow and evapotranspiration and also the groundwater surface water interaction 2 precipitation characteristics such as sequences of dry and wet spell characteristics that control the persistence in rainfall which then through the various catchment processes translates to long term persistence in streamflow while the above discussions have brought to fore the various influencers of persistence in streamflow and rainfall the focus has to move from a single variable to a multi variable domain to make the analysis of persistence more realistic studying more than one variable in the context of persistence may reveal interesting insights in the processes behaviour and their interactions across different spatial and temporal scales furthermore the temporal evolution of the persistence of the processes and their interactions is still a topic for further enquiry this can give insights about the underlying dynamics that controls their degree of persistence at different time scales another important aspect in context to the persistence of streamflow is the form of precipitation i e fraction of precipitation falling as snow fs which provides persistent flows during dry periods in this study the following research issues based on the aforementioned discussion are explored a temporal evolution of the persistence of rainfall streamflow and their joint behaviour across multiple spatial scales b effect of rainfall amount on the cross correlation structure of rainfall and streamflow c effect of catchment area on the cross correlation structure of rainfall and streamflow and d influence of changing patterns of dry and wet spells on the cross correlation behaviour on catchments with varying degree of fs the following sections in the paper delineate these study objectives methodology analyses and discussion of the results in section 2 details of the methodologies used to address the above objectives are presented along with the details of the study area and the data used in the study for this study we have selected catchments from cauvery river basin in india and mopex watersheds in usa the results are analysed in section 3 where suitable numerical experiments are discussed first and their results are elaborated finally the conclusions of the study are presented along with limitations of the study in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used for the purpose of the study the watersheds from united states and from southern india are selected to examine the persistence in different climatological settings the cauvery river basin fig 1 of southern india is bounded between 75 27 to 79 54 e and 10 9 to 13 30 n with a total surface area of 85 155 sq km which is around 2 7 of the total geographical area of the country the cauvery river is one of the major rivers of peninsular india which flows eastward through the indian states of kerala karnataka tamil nadu and the union territory of puducherry to meet the bay of bengal the river basin experiences both tropical and sub tropical climatic conditions the major part of the basin is covered by agricultural land 67 of the total area and as a result of this large number of water storage structures reservoirs and dams have been constructed to meet the demand for water primarily for agriculture during the dry season due to this human intervention the flows at the downstream of the structures are expected to be influenced by the regulation for the purpose of the analysis the natural streamflow records from ten gauging stations are selected with no major structural interventions upstream the selected gauging stations and their corresponding basins have the least influence of human interventions the location details of the gauging stations and their contributing sub catchment areas are provided in table a 1 in appendix a the daily streamflow data is obtained from india wris database www india wris nrsc gov in the contemporaneous daily precipitation datasets are extracted from imd india meteorological department database with a spatial resolution of 0 25ᵒ 0 25ᵒ which are interpolated from the station data pai et al 2014 the grids for the cauvery river basins are extracted from the imd gridded datasets and simple averaging was done to represent the rainfall over a particular sub catchment based on the number of grids falling within the sub catchment there is no contribution of snowfall in this basin in order to study the influence of fraction of snowfall contribution fs on the persistence of streamflow the watersheds from mopex model parameter estimation project datasets ftp hydrology nws noaa gov pub gcip mopex us data us 438 daily have been selected schaake et al 2006 the mopex datasets consist of time series of precipitation streamflow potential evapotranspiration and maximum and minimum temperature based on the work of berghuijs et al 2014 90 watersheds fig 2 and table a 2 in appendix a from mopex database have been selected on the basis of fraction of precipitation fs contributed from snow these watersheds are classified into three categories namely watersheds with fs equal to 0 fs less than 0 15 and fs greater than 0 5 based on study conducted by berghuijs et al 2014 the degree of fs influences the persistence characteristics of streamflow in each of the watersheds 2 2 methodology traditionally the persistence in hydrologic variables is estimated using auto correlation function of series such that the persistence decays with time by power law for example let ri be daily streamflow observed at any gauging station where i i 1 2 n denotes the number of days of observations and r i be the mean value in order to remove the seasonal trends as it affects the estimation process a series of anomalies ψ is considered as 1 ψ i r i r i the auto correlation function is defined as 2 c s ψ i ψ i s s γ 0 γ 1 where denotes the average of all pairs with time lag s the auto correlation function c s is highly influenced by the presence of trend in the time series also it becomes highly unstable due to small length of the records common in most of hydrologic time series kantelhardt et al 2006 in order to overcome these limitations the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa although debated bryce and sprague 2012 höll and kantz 2015 is one of the commonly used methods applied in this analysis bunde et al 2000 hajian and movahed 2010 ludescher et al 2017 traditional data processing methods may not be the best choice as they will be unable to reduce the effects of non stationary factors which are manifested by trends and noise which may affect the persistence the presence of seasonality in the time series poses problems in evaluating persistence and thus it must be removed prior to further analysis in this analysis it is assumed that the trend is linear and it is removed by the by polynomial detrending of suitable order 2 similar to dfa in order to analyse the joint behaviour of persistence of two variables e g rainfall and streamflow through the investigation of power law cross correlation detrended cross correlation analysis dcca is used dcca was first introduced by podobnik and stanley 2008 at different temporal scales the degree of influence of rainfall and catchment processes on the persistence of streamflow is non uniform in order to capture the state of persistence at different time scales multiple temporal windows are selected fig 3 the temporal scales are selected as seasonal annual and larger time scales to identify the signatures in the joint behaviour of persistence of streamflow and rainfall across catchments of different area as well as different fraction of precipitation falling as snow the algorithms describing the dfa and dcca are given in the appendices b 1 and b 2 respectively the flowchart showing the methodology used in the study is given in fig 3 the h and λ are the univariate and bivariate counterparts of hurst coefficient estimated through dfa and dcca respectively this approach helps to explore the temporal evolution of persistence dynamics through the determination of hurst coefficient and also the coupled behaviour across multi temporal scales the data used for the analysis is at daily time resolution and the multi temporal estimates of hurst coefficient are obtained for time scales ranging from 100 to 1000 days such an analysis has direct application in case of hydrological droughts typically manifested by the combined influence of low rainfall and streamflow in the following paragraphs the details of the numerical experiments used for addressing the proposed objectives are discussed the cross correlation structure reveals the mutual influence of rainfall and streamflow and it is important to study the joint influence to understand the dynamics of their persistence across the different temporal scales in particular the observed rainfall time series can be realized as a series comprising of both dry and wet spells to examine whether the magnitude of rainfall amounts have any impact on cross correlation structure a numerical experiment is designed as follows the mean and the standard deviation of the observed rainfall time series are preserved and are used to simulate normally distributed random numbers the non zero rainfall values of the observed rainfall time series are replaced with the random numbers thus generated and the series is referred as reconstructed time series the hurst coefficient of the cross correlation at different temporal scales is computed as described in the flowchart fig 3 considering the reconstructed rainfall time series and the observed streamflow time series if the difference in the hurst coefficient of this new series and that of the observed series is less than 0 5 then it can be concluded that the rainfall amount has no role in the cross correlation structure matsoukas et al 2000 if however the difference is more than 0 5 it would mean that the state of persistence is altered and thus the rainfall amount will influence the dynamics of the cross correlation structure in the above numerical experiment reconstructed time series of rainfall is used to assess the persistence behaviour of cross correlation of the rainfall and streamflow the streamflow time series used in this numerical experiment is the observed series this could spark a question on whether the results will be affected if the corresponding streamflow resulting from the reconstructed rainfall time series is used a major hypothesis is that whatever be the magnitude of rainfall in the reconstructed rainfall time series the state of persistence of corresponding streamflow will be the same as the observed state of persistence of streamflow in order to check the accuracy of this claim a multiple linear regression model is formulated and used for simulating the streamflow using reconstructed rainfall time series for analysing the state of persistence in this new set up the steps described in fig 3 are used the results and discussion of this numerical experiment and are discussed in section 3 2 to understand the role of catchment size on the persistence characteristics of streamflow another numerical experiment is designed utilizing the fact that an observed time series of rainfall can be considered as a sequence of dry and wet periods a binary series of rainfall is constructed by replacing all non zero elements in rainfall series with numeric ones 1 s and keeping the zeros intact then the analysis as described in fig 3 for the estimation of cross correlation between the observed streamflow and binary rainfall series are carried out if the value of the hurst coefficient obtained from the binary series λ2 is the same as that of the original cross correlation structure λ1 then it is evident that the catchments contribute equally to the persistence of the observed cross correlation otherwise the difference between λ 1 and λ 2 can be used as an indicator to infer about the contribution of catchment area in terms of the state of catchment processes to the persistence of streamflow the results and discussion on the numerical experiments described in this paragraph are provided in section 3 3 the final numerical experiment is set up to understand how the changes in the observed patterns of spells affect the joint persistence of rainfall and streamflow to understand this a numerical experiment using the binary series of rainfall consisting simply of rainy and non rainy days is performed in the experiment the number of rainy days number of ones in binary rainfall dataset in a year are fixed and randomly shuffled across the series and applied the same method i e dcca to obtain the cross covariance structure the analysis and results of this numerical experiment is discussed section 3 4 in the next section the results of the experiments described above are discussed 3 results and discussions 3 1 temporal evolution of the hurst coefficient of rainfall streamflow and their cross correlation structure across multiple temporal scales in fig 4 the plots of the log transformations of fluctuation function and time scales are shown for both dfa and dcca respectively the slope of the plots for subsets corresponding to different time scales as mentioned in the fig 3 will give the estimate of hurst coefficient for individual rainfall and streamflow time series using dfa and their joint behaviour using dcca in fig 5 the temporal evolution of the persistence of rainfall and the streamflow in the cauvery river basin is presented which exhibits quite a few distinct characteristics it is observed that the persistence of streamflow green curve is always more than that of the rainfall the streamflow is a smoothened process and thus exhibits a longer persistence kantelhardt et al 2006 this happens due to the rainfall process characterised by weak persistence interacting with the landscape characteristics such as the channel networks status of soil moisture interaction with groundwater and related catchment processes to generate streamflow the persistence in rainfall black curve is lower than that of streamflow as it exhibits high variability in intensity and duration across the space and time scales the temporal evolution of persistence through the dynamic behaviour of hurst coefficient across time scales can be visualized in the figure understanding the temporal evolution of persistence helps greatly in the exploration of the underlying dynamics and the interaction with other processes that govern the variable of interest the red curve denotes the joint behaviour of rainfall and streamflow in terms of persistence across multiple time scales through dcca one of the characteristics of the cross correlation structure is that it is varying across time scales which signifies that the degree of persistence in streamflow which is explained by rainfall as well as catchment related characteristics is not constant across multiple time scales the temporal evolution of the cross correlation structure is one of the important properties to be understood the dynamic behaviour of the cross correlation structure comprises of the effect of persistence of rainfall characteristics and contribution of catchment processes in fig 6 the temporal evolution of hurst coefficient as a function of fs across mopex watersheds are shown a similar behaviour of dynamics of hurst coefficient across different spatial scales catchments of different areas is observed both in the case of cauvery basin and the mopex watersheds where there is no contribution of snow fs 0 00 for watersheds with fs more than 0 5 it is found that at all temporal scales the values of the dynamic hurst coefficient for streamflow is more than 1 0 which suggests that the streamflow does not exhibit power law behaviour also in the watersheds where fs values are less than 0 15 the dynamic hurst coefficient for streamflow shows variability across both temporal and spatial scales from these observations it can be concluded that due to the combined influence of watershed area and fs the streamflow deviates from the power law behaviour across temporal scales apart from the temporal evolution of hurst coefficient across multiple time scales it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the persistence between rainfall and streamflow in a given time scale across all watersheds generally the watersheds are highly heterogeneous in terms of land use land cover soil characteristics state of soil moisture etc which significantly influence the state of persistence of streamflow in a region these characteristics play an important role in rainfall runoff transformations at a variety of space and temporal scales and thus influence the state and magnitude of persistence according to blöschl and sivapalan 1995 the flow response at event scale is primarily controlled by the storm and basin characteristics at annual scale streamflow is governed by periodicity of rainfall evapotranspiration and snowmelt even at longer time scales the effects of long term variability of rainfall and climate geomorphologic processes and anthropogenic activities influence the streamflow regime pelletier and turcotte 1997 as a result the state as well as magnitude as measured by λ of joint persistence among rainfall and streamflow will exhibit different degrees at multiple temporal scales in fig 7 the variation of the joint persistence of streamflow and rainfall across multiple temporal scales for cauvery river basin and mopex watersheds of different degree of fs are shown it is evident that there is a negative correlation between the mean hurst coefficient across all catchments and the temporal scales this suggests that different controlling factors are predominant at different temporal scales that govern the persistence of streamflow rather than only rainfall i e the state of the catchment characteristics plays a dominant role in the evolution of persistence of streamflow for most of the catchments of cauvery river as well as mopex watersheds with fs 0 00 and fs 0 15 there exists a negative correlation consistently at different time scales the mopex watersheds with fs 0 50 shows positive correlation this can be attributed to slow and steady processes of snowmelt give rise to gradual increase in streamflow from these analyses it is evident that the runoff generation mechanism and the state of the catchment characteristics play a major role in the evolution of persistence in streamflow 3 2 effect of the rainfall amounts on the cross correlation structure of rainfall and streamflow the hurst coefficient obtained by performing dcca reveals the influence of the rainfall patterns and characteristics of the state of the catchment processes on the state of persistence of the streamflow the results presented in this section are based on the experiments designed in section 2 2 which consist of two parts in the first part of this section the influence of the rainfall amount on the cross correlation structure is investigated the analysis is performed over all of mopex catchments irrespective of fs and the cauvery river basin the second part of the discussion is related to examining whether the state of persistence of streamflow is affected if the magnitude of the rainfall is changed the boxplots in figs 8 a b and 9 represent the difference between the dynamic hurst coefficients of cross correlation for the two series of rainfall observed and reconstructed series with the observed streamflow series for mopex watersheds and cauvery river basin respectively it is clear that the differences are well under 0 5 the scatter plots in the figures represent the overall difference which is the difference of hurst coefficients of cross correlation structure of reconstructed and observed rainfall dataset with the observed streamflow without considering the dynamic time scales it is observed that this difference is also well under 0 5 from these observations it is evident that the at all temporal scales the amount of rainfall has no influence on the state of persistence of the cross correlation structure of streamflow and rainfall at watersheds irrespective of form of precipitation and size of watershed based on the discussions in section 2 2 to investigate whether changing the rainfall magnitude as in the reconstructed rainfall time series will have any influence on the state of persistence of streamflow a multiple regression model is formed with rainfall r mean temperature t and potential evapotranspiration pe as covariates to explain the observed streamflow f in one of the watersheds the data used for the analysis is taken from mopex dataset for usgs site id 1 606 500 schaake et al 2006 the regression model is of the form f 0 116171 r 0 181760 pe 0 091701 t 1 83 with multiple r 2 0 1207 the model constructed is found to be useful when tested for the hypothesis of non zero model parameters using f test with resulting p value 2 2 10 16 using this model synthetic streamflow is generated with the reconstructed rainfall time series keeping other variables same as observed the results are shown in fig 10 from the figure it can be seen that the state of persistence of rainfall streamflow and their cross correlation structure do not change even after replacing the actual non zero rainfall values with random numbers this indicates that the magnitude of the rainfall has no effect on its own state of persistence as well as the joint persistence of rainfall and streamflow this suggests that the state of the catchment processes that governs the runoff generation mechanism plays a major role in the dynamics of the persistence characteristics of streamflow in the next section how this effect is attributed to the persistence of streamflow as a function of catchment area is discussed 3 3 effect of the catchment area on the cross correlation structure of rainfall and streamflow kantelhardt et al 2006 suggested that the persistence of streamflow can be partially explained by the persistence in rainfall through its intermittent patterns and that storage of water in soil and river networks mudelsee 2007 which is the function of catchment area dominates the persistence of the streamflow the persistence structure of cross correlation between rainfall and streamflow is affected mostly by catchment related characteristics which can be assume to be a function of the catchment area and slightly by the persistence of rainfall in view of this suggestion the question of how the size of catchment influences the cross correlation structure is explored to address this question a binary series of rainfall i e series consisting of rainy and non rainy days is constructed as described in section 2 2 and the method described in fig 3 is used to infer about the results of the numerical experiment this numerical experiment may have far reaching implications there exists a systematic difference among the hurst coefficients as a function of the catchment area the degree of departure of cross correlation structures defined by the binary series of rainfall from the original series to the observed streamflow reveals the contribution of the catchment processes which is the function of catchment area influencing the persistence in streamflow different catchment related characteristics such as state of soil moisture land use land cover etc may have dominant effect on the joint persistence structure of rainfall and streamflow at different temporal scales in comparison to the persistence characteristics of observed rainfall in figs 11 and 12 the departure of the cross correlation structure as difference between λ1 and λ2 is presented as a function of the catchment area it can be observed that there exists a large variability in the difference across spatial scales which is due to the variability in the different catchment processes contributing towards persistence of streamflow for fs 0 15 and fs 0 00 there are 60 and 16 watersheds respectively showing a significant relationship p value 0 05 between the contribution of the catchment processes to persistence in streamflow and the catchment area in the mopex watersheds with fs 0 50 and the cauvery river basin a positive association is found but it is not significant p value 0 05 as it was in the previous case due to sampling variability as p value is a function of sample size therefore it can be concluded that larger the catchment size the more is the influence of its characteristics on the persistence of streamflow resulting in higher differences between λ1 and λ2 3 4 effect of changing patterns of dry and wet spells on cross correlation between rainfall and streamflow in previous sections the evolution of the persistence behaviour of rainfall streamflow and their joint dynamics are discussed from different perspectives starting from the state of the catchment related processes to the patterns of rainfall in this section the influence of the changing patterns of rainfall on the state of persistence of joint behaviour and the state of persistence of rainfall alone is studied for that purpose the numerical experiment described in section 2 2 is followed the results are presented in figs 13 and 14 for the mopex watersheds and cauvery river basin respectively there are two findings observed in these plots first the state of persistence of rainfall is dramatically affected by the changing patterns of dry and wet spells of the observed rainfall time series after shuffling the patterns of the dry and the wet spells the multi temporal persistence across different time scales is observed to be very close to 0 5 which suggests that the state of persistence of rainfall approaches the state of white noise secondly the state of persistence of the joint behaviour of the streamflow and rainfall is unaffected by the changing patterns of the dry and wet spells for all the catchments irrespective of time scales and the degree of precipitation falling as snow fs 4 conclusions in this paper the temporal dynamics of the persistence of streamflow rainfall and their joint behaviour through cross correlation analysis is explored through the estimation hurst coefficient using dfa and dcca respectively the mopex basins usa with varying degrees of fraction of precipitation falling as snow as well as the cauvery river basin from southern peninsular india with no snowfall contribution are considered for the study it is observed that the degree of persistence is different at different time scales for their cross correlation as well as individually for rainfall and streamflow the behaviour of the persistence of cross correlation is explained as a function of the catchment area as well as at different temporal scales to discern the different controlling factors of rainfall runoff transformation the major conclusions that are derived from the study are as follows 1 the degree of persistence of rainfall and streamflow and their joint behaviour shows a dynamic evolution across temporal scales by analysing the cross correlation the dependence of streamflow persistence on rainfall is not uniform across temporal scales also the persistence is influenced by both rainfall patterns and catchment processes that contribute to the persistence of streamflow at different time scales 2 the state of persistence of cross correlation structure between rainfall and streamflow across the different time scales as well as spatial scales are not controlled by the amount of rainfall observed 3 the contribution of the catchment related processes to the persistence of the streamflow increases with the increasing catchment area although there could exist variability due to the sample size this finding is similar to that of hirpa et al 2010 even though they did not separate out the influence of patterns of dry and wet spells of rainfall from the persistence structure of streamflow the combined influence of catchment area as well as fraction of snowfall contribution fs is responsible for the deviation from power law behaviour in case of streamflow it is observed that with fs 0 50 streamflow deviates from power law behaviour across all spatial and temporal scales 4 the importance of the actual patterns of dry and wet spells on cross correlation structure is also explored in this study by changing the number of days between the two consecutive wet spells keeping the number of rainy days constant in a year the state of persistence of the cross correlation between rainfall and streamflow is not affected across all spatial and temporal scales whereas the state of persistence of rainfall is severely affected by the changing patterns of the observed dry and wet spells which approaches the border of the state of positive and anti persistence a major application of this study can be in the field of drought hazard assessment which has implications for agricultural production and water management inclusion of the concept of joint persistence in the modelling the return periods of droughts will have far reaching applications in prediction of drought characteristics extreme events such as hydrological droughts are manifested by combined influence of low rainfall and streamflow and thus investigating their joint persistence behaviour at multiple scales will help in better understanding the mechanism of the recurrence time of droughts pelletier and turcotte 1997 showed that using autoregressive models overestimate the recurrence interval of drought by significant amount as there is no room for preserving the persistence in the simple autoregressive models large scale climate oscillation such as el niño southern oscillation enso also influences global and regional hydrological processes ausloos et al 2017 interpreted the dynamics of hurst coefficient in relation with el niño and north atlantic oscillation nao while examining the persistence properties of paglia river in central italy it is to be noted that in the analysis the catchment related processes that contribute to the persistence in streamflow are assumed to be lumped the catchment processes such as soil moisture dynamics groundwater surface water interactions land use land cover influence etc that contribute to persistence of streamflow can be used in the future studies to explore the contributions of the processes to streamflow persistence although in this study the watersheds with varying degree of fs and semi arid basin are explored the same framework can be further used to understand patterns in some extreme environments like catchments in arid environments or rapidly urbanizing environments this would give an idea about what other processes influence

as ranged scale analysis r s analysis and periodogram regression which are used for analysing persistence in time series detrended fluctuation analysis is used in this study it is preferred because the estimates obtained through this method are not sensitive to the non stationary characteristics of time series hajian and movahed 2010 and it works well for time series with finite samples ludescher et al 2017 the algorithm of detrended fluctuation analysis is presented below let xk denote a time series which may be of daily rainfall or streamflow in the present analysis after removing the seasonal component from the time series by subtracting the inter annual mean from each daily value the series yk is composed of trend component and noise step 1 calculate profile for the time series b 1 y i k 1 i y k for i 1 2 n step 2 divide the profile y i into n s n s non overlapping segments of equal lengths s as the record length n need not be a multiple of segment length s there will be certain part of the data which always remains outside the non overlapping segments therefore to bring the remaining part of the dataset in the same procedure is repeated from the end of the series thus there are 2ns number of segments step 3 in this step the local trends for each segment s are calculated by fitting a polynomial of degree n therefore the detrended series ys by removing the polynomial fits from the de seasonalised time series data in each segment b 2 y s i y i p v i where v 1 2 2ns in this analysis quadratic polynomial function have been fitted which will remove first order trend from the observed time series of rainfall and streamflow step 4 in this step variance for each of the 2ns segments b 3 f s 2 v 1 s i 1 s y s 2 v 1 s i of detrended series ys i are calculated by taking mean overall data points i in the vth segment step 5 in the final step the detrended fluctuation function is determined as follows b 4 f s 1 2 n s v 1 2 n s f s 2 v 0 5 the scaling coefficient of the fluctuation function f s can be estimated from linear regression of f s vs s in a log log plane as b 5 f s s h q where h q is the generalized hurst coefficient and in this analysis h q is confined at q 2 the scaling coefficient h q 2 the second order moment is identical to the hurst coefficient h 0 5 h q 2 1 denotes the presence of positive persistence in the time series whereas 0 h q 2 0 5 shows the presence of anti persistence h q 2 1 indicates that the series is correlated but does not exhibit power law behaviour hirpa et al 2010 b 2 detrended cross correlation analysis there could be situations when it is necessary to explore the influence of the fluctuations of one variable on the other this will enable us to understand how persistence in one variable affects the persistence in the other variable understanding this dependence structure helps us to explore a variety of scenarios in the driving variable and how it influences the target variable across both space and time scales to explore all these possibilities the detrended cross correlation analysis is performed as follows consider two time series xk and yk for k 1 2 n both the series are de seasonalised in order to remove the seasonal component by the approach discussed in section 3 1 let xk and yk denote the de seasonalised series the steps for the detrended cross correlation analysis are as follows step 1 the profile x i and y i for the series xk and yk are calculated as follows b 6 x i k 1 i x k b 7 y i k 1 i y k for all i 1 2 n step 2 division of each of the profile to n s n s non overlapping segments of equal length s is done and the fluctuation functions for each segments are computed as there are 2ns segments first the fluctuation function is computed up to ns segments and then from ns 1 to 2ns the computations of the fluctuation functions are as follows b 8 f s m 1 s i 1 s y m 1 s i y m i x m 1 s i x m i for m 1 2 ns and b 9 f s m 1 s i 1 s y n m 1 s i y m i x n m 1 s i x m i for the remaining segments m ns 1 2ns here xm and ym are the fitted polynomials for mth segment step 3 finally by averaging the fluctuation function for all segments it can be written as b 10 f 2 s 1 2 n s m 1 2 n s f s m 0 5 the fluctuation function f 2 s will increase as power law and can be expressed as follows b 11 f 2 s s λ 2 this is a special case of multi fractal generalization of second order moment the coefficient λ denotes the level of cross correlation between the two series if λ 0 5 it indicates positive persistence in joint behaviour of the two series i e increase decrease in value of one variable follows increase decrease in value of the other if λ 0 5 on the other hand it denotes anti persistent behaviour in the coupled relationship i e increase decrease in value of the one variable flows decrease increase in the value of the other λ 0 5 denotes they are un correlated dutta et al 2014 appendix c fig c 1 and fig c 2 
759,we quantify the poorly understood interactions between resident and infiltrating water during drainage imbibition cycles in heterogeneous porous media via a 2 d and 3 d lattice boltzmann simulation method these interactions are critical in the partially saturated soil layer which is the interface from land surface to groundwater that controls the fate and transport of infiltrating water and chemicals to aquifers the results demonstrate the sensitivity of these dynamic interactions to the contact angle boundary flux condition body force and porosity we show that the body force and contact angle have relatively small effects on interactions in the capillary flow regime while the boundary flux and porosity alter the amount and distribution of resident and infiltrating water significantly moreover air water interfaces are shown to be dynamically concave convex determined by both contact angle and pore geometry our analysis demonstrates the coexistence of distinct pockets of resident and infiltrating water and provides pore scale mechanistic evidence that supports field observations of soil water zones with different chemical signatures keywords resident infiltrating water interactions drainage imbibition cycle lattice boltzmann method lbm shan chen model 1 introduction the vadose or partially saturated zone plays a significant role in the environment because it is the critical interface from land surface to groundwater that controls the fate and transport of both infiltrating water and chemicals imbibition and drainage processes in this multicomponent multiphase system have been a subject of intense study for decades field experiments have been carried out to characterize flow patterns and related transport phenomena ghodrati and jury 1990 hill and parlange 1972 ritsema et al 1993 and noninvasive measurement techniques and numerical modeling methods have been developed to explore the pore scale details of fluid distributions pohlmeier et al 2008 porter and wildenschild 2010 sněhota et al 2010 dynamic interactions between fluids galindo torres et al 2013 porter et al 2009 and contaminant transport luo et al 2008 raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 however these efforts have focused mainly on the immiscible interaction between water and air and related phenomena the actual interaction between resident and infiltrating water which occurs during cycles of drainage and imbibition has received little attention notwithstanding recognition that patterns of fluid migration and chemical mixing between resident and infiltrating water are highly non uniform and heterogeneous and that resident and infiltrating waters can maintain different chemical signatures in this context several field experiments using non reactive tracers showed not only that resident water is the main component of outflow in soil profiles when infiltration rainfall first occurs but also that resident water is retained in the soil for hours days and even years collins et al 2000 turton et al 1995 mass exchange between immobile water resident water and mobile infiltrating water can continue for tens of years gvirtzman et al 1988 moreover a series of field measurements of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicated that precipitation which supplies groundwater recharge and streamflow is different from the water that supplies some soil water recharge and plant transpiration brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 mcdonnell 2017 similar measurements also showed that pore water in peat profiles is flushed out mainly by recharge from the near surface peat levy et al 2016 all of these field observations challenge the classical assumption that resident water in soil mixes with and or is displaced fully by infiltrating water and indicate the occurrence of different mechanisms of interaction between resident and infiltrating water various mathematical frameworks that include models for water mixing have been proposed to quantify these phenomena botter et al 2010 2011 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 weiler et al 2003 for example in catchments incorporation of soil moisture dynamics to express travel time of water in soil has been proposed botter et al 2010 with soil water conceptualized as mobile and immobile immobile water can become mobilized during rainfall events such a model mimics mixing processes between old and new water but assumes that the rainfall mobilized immobile water involves randomly all of the available regions and ages of water in the soil and does not provide any information at the pore scale in parallel several laboratory experiments and numerical studies gouet kaplan et al 2012 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 gouet kaplan et al 2009 explored pore scale interactions between resident and infiltrating water these studies identified three mechanisms of interaction between resident and infiltrating water 1 displacement and flow of resident water pockets as they became connected to new channels 2 partial or full mixing of resident water with infiltrating water 3 diffusive transfer of solute from old water to new water as new water flows through a channel these analyses however are limited to high porosities and or regular pore structures that are not fully representative of natural soils as well as to a narrow range of hydraulic conditions here to examine the effects of complex soil geometry and topology on interactions between resident and infiltrating water we implement a lattice boltzmann method lbm with two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d irregular pore structures for capillary flow regime for the scenarios we examine here which focus on the interplay between resident and infiltrating water during a cycle of drainage and imbibition the modified shan chen model is chosen two other principal lbm models for multicomponent multiphase flow color gradient and free energy have natural advantages for dealing with higher viscosity leclaire et al 2017 and density ratios shao et al 2014 zheng et al 2006 however these models target two component two phase immiscible fluid systems and it is difficult to include additional fluids these models are thus less suitable for treating a scenario such as the one of interest here which involves interaction of three fluid air resident water and infiltrating water in the domain to account for miscible processes e g mixing between two fluids one fluid can be treated as a solute relative to the other fluid in a multicomponent multiphase shan chen model by eliminating or significantly reducing local interactions between them sukop and thorne 2006 shan and doolen 1995 also showed that the multiphase multicomponent shan chen lbm model can recover the advection diffusion equation using the chapman enskog expansion on the other hand the shan chen model which has an explicit force scheme with an especially high isotropy scheme has been shown to handle effectively high viscosity ratios between fluids porter et al 2012 moreover it has been demonstrated that the influence of a high density ratio can be neglected when the flow is in the capillary regime schaap et al 2007 thus the multiphase multicomponent shan chen lbm model is capable of simulating the immscible miscible fluid flow process of interest here with more complex pore structures we investigate how various factors boundary flux condition wettability body force and porosity influence the interactions between the resident and infiltrating water our results demonstrate that the boundary flux and the pore structure can affect the amount and distribution of resident and infiltrating water significantly while wettability and body force are less influential these pore scale simulations provide mechanistic evidence that supports field observations of resident and infiltrating water interactions resident infiltrating water interactions are also affected by the air water interface geometry which is shown to be dynamic the interface between air and water evolves and varies between convex and concave which is determined not only by contact angle but also by the geometry of the pore space 2 method 2 1 lattice boltzmann method the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a discretized form of the boltzmann equation and derived from the bgk approximation in this method the discrete distribution function fi is introduced to represent fluid particles in certain directions as shown in fig 1 and satisfies the equation 1 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t 1 τ f x t f i e q x t where fi is the distribution function for fluid particles in the direction of discrete velocity e i and τ is the relaxation rate related to the kinematic viscosity ν 1 3 τ 1 2 the equilibrium function f i e q is usually calculated as 2 f i e q w i ρ 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where wi is the weight coefficient whose value depends on the direction i ρ is the macroscopic density calculated as ρ i 0 n f i and u is the macroscopic velocity given by u 1 ρ i 0 n f i e i it has been shown that the navier stokes equation can be recovered from the lbm eqs 1 and 2 using the chapman enskog expansion chen and doolen 1998 the basic idea in the shan chen model is to incorporate interaction forces between fluid particles by means of 3 f σ n g c ψ n x t n n i 1 w i ψ n x e i δ t t e i where n and n denote the different fluids ψ is the potential of fluid at the location x and is calculated from different equations of state gc is the interaction strength coefficient which controls the cohesion force between fluids when gc is positive the fluids repel each other when gc is negative the force is cohesive this form of the force between fluids indicates that the number of fluid types is limited only by computational resources here the infiltrating water is treated as the third fluid with its own particle distribution function f i i w macroscopic density ρiw and other parameters when the imbibition starts the interactions with air and resident water are also calculated by eq 3 the force between fluids and solid phase is calculated in a similar manner 4 f a d s n x t g a d s n ρ x t i 1 w i s x e i δ t e i where g ads n is the interaction strength coefficient for nth fluid to solid cohesion and s x e i δ t is the indicator function of solid phase 1 solid phase 0 void space for fluid whether the fluid is wetting or non wetting is adjusted by changing the value of g ads n from negative to positive which means that g ads n determines the contact angle the total force for each fluid is 5 f n f σ n f a d s n if a certain type of body force is required to be included f n b will be added to this equation to integrate fluid fluid cohesion and fluid solid cohesion into the lbm the original shan chen model replaces the velocity u in eq 2 with macroscopic equilibrium velocity u eq 6 u n e q u τ n f n ρ n where the velocity u is defined as 7 u n ρ n u τ n n ρ n τ n schaap et al 2007 showed that the original shan chen model can be applied to simulate water air drainage and imbibition processes when the capillary force is dominant and the relaxation rates are the same when the viscous force cannot be neglected or a larger viscosity ratio is included in the simulation another way of integrating force f n is implemented porter et al 2012 8 f i n x e i δ t t δ t f i n x t ω c o l l n δ t 2 f i f n x e i δ t t δ t f i f n x t moreover compared to the original shan chen method this approach also makes surface tension between two fluids independent of the viscosity ratio between them porter et al 2012 the collision term ω c o l l n is the same as the right part of eq 1 without the force term the external force term here is calculated as 9 f i f n f n e i u eq ρ n c s 2 f i eq n where fn is the sum of all external and body forces for the nth component cs is the so called sound speed in lbm u eq is different from the equilibrium velocity in eq 6 compared to the original shan chen method which includes the external and body forces through adding the force term to the effective velocity the forces in the explicit force method are incorporated directly into the distribution function as eq 8 therefore the effective velocity in eq 7 is usually used here for u eq of each fluid component but the momentum conservation is still retained the original distribution function is transformed to 10 f i n f i n δ t 2 f i f n and then applied to eq 8 for both f i n at time step t and t δ t we obtain 11 f i n x e i δ t t δ t δ t 2 f i f n x e i δ t t δ t f i n x t δ t 2 f i f n x t 1 τ n f i e q n x t f i n x t δ t 2 f i f n x t δ t 2 f i f n x e i δ t t δ t f i f n x t clearly the force term of the next step can be canceled on both sides of the equation finally the explicit force scheme is 12 f i n x e i δ t t δ t f i n e i t 1 τ n f i eq n x t f i n x t δ t 2 f i f n δ t f i f n the macroscopic parameters density and momentum of each fluid are calculated as 13 ρ n i f i n 14 ρ n u i f i n e i δ t 2 f n thus the transformed distribution function f i n can be used to calculate the macroscopic parameters of the system therefore the transformation in eq 10 only needs to be implemented at the beginning of the simulation which saves the computational cost as well 2 2 numerical experiments the simulations are in 2d so the lbm scheme here is d2q9 prior to running simulations with the binary image shown in fig 2 the contact angle and interface evolution tests were run in a binary fluid system and regular pores to confirm that the interface characteristics between immsicible fluids water and air are captured correctly subsequently simulations of drainage imbibition cycles to investigate the interplay between resident and infiltrating water were run with the image fig 2 the size of the domain is 73 2 33 1 mm and the porosity is 38 2 the minimum maximum and mean pore space diameters are 0 046 mm 2 66 mm and 1 48 mm respectively the resolution of a pixel is 0 046 mm 46 µm while current x ray tomography reaches higher resolutions the image used here was sufficient for the purposes of this study which required correct identification of the location and movement of the interface in related contexts similar resolutions were employed by others porter et al 2009 schaap et al 2007 in each simulation a neumann constant flux rate inlet boundary condition is prescribed on the left side of the structure the method zou and he 1997 proposed is the most common one but here we apply a method chang et al 2009 that has a smoother pressure gradient see appendix section a 1 the outlet boundary is prescribed as a zero gradient boundary lou et al 2013 the top and the bottom are set up as periodic boundary conditions and the macroscopic flow is from left to right in the domain to reach the component separation between water and air the interaction strength coefficient is based on numerical experiments huang et al 2007 porter et al 2012 which can minimize diffusion between the two fluids in our case air and water phases on the other hand the resident and infiltrating waters are considered to be fluids having the same properties so that the interaction coefficient is set up to be below the threshold of separating the two fluids as table 1 shows air and water are set to have different relaxation rates and viscosity values conversion of physical units to lattice units while maintaining the same time step is explained in the appendix section a 2 all of the simulations start with the initial condition that the domain is fully saturated air then enters the domain at a constant rate until the flow in the domain is in steady state the inlet boundary condition is then replaced by imbibition of water this boundary condition is maintained until steady state conditions are reached again following pan et al 2006 and yang 2013 steady state conditions are considered to be reached for 15 m u x t u x t 100 2 m u x 5 2 10 6 or 16 s r w t s r w t 100 s r w t 100 10 6 due to the data structure of lbm all of the equations are solved numerically using graphic processing units nvidia tesla k40 gpu cards in this way simulation run times are reduced to durations of a few days 3 results and analysis all of the drainage imbibition simulations were in the capillary flow domain with capillary numbers ca in the range 10 5 10 4 c a v i n η i n σ where vin and ηin are the mean velocity and dynamic viscosity of displacing fluids at the inlet respectively σ is the surface tension and with a viscosity ratio of 15 m ν w ν a to confirm that the lbm is capable of capturing the characteristics of mixing between resident and infiltrating water lbm solutions for such a displacement process in a single regular pore 1 2 mm 1 0 mm were compared to those obtained with openfoam the openfoam software package for open source field operation and manipulation is a c toolbox of finite volume numerical solvers for continuum mechanics including computational fluid dynamics cfd weller et al 1998 it was found that the lbm solutions were very similar to those of the twoliquidmixingfoam solver in openfoam when the péclet number pé v m e a n d c h a r d where vmean and dchar are the mean velocty in the pore space and the mean pore space diameter respectively d is the diffusion coefficient of the fluid was about 30 above this value the lbm solution may underestimate the degree of mixing by several percent the values of pé in the simulations considered here were generally in the range of 3 30 only for vhigh did pé values in a few pores reach as high as 90 as a consequence for the scenarios considered here the main characteristics of mixing between resident and infiltrating water can be captured moreover by using the approach described here of integrating the force term spurious currents around interfaces were suppressed typical lattice velocities in the pores were of the order of 10 4 l u t 1 and velocities around the air water interfaces increased compared to the neighboring area but were usually of the same order only when the interface moved through very narrow pore spaces equivalent to less than 10 pixels in the image did the magnitude sometimes reach the order of 10 3 l u t 1 in contrast for example simulation of air water interactions in a static bubble in a gravity free fully periodic domain indicated that most of the lattice velocities were in the range 10 5 l u t 1 10 4 l u t 1 note also that shan chen lbm simulations have been shown to be reliable at low velocities and capillary numbers 10 8 10 5 huang et al 2009 schaap et al 2007 3 1 effects of contact angle simulations were first carried out to test the effect of contact angle usually the parameters for the interactions between the fluids and the solid phase are g a d s n g a d s n where g ads n accounts for the surrounding fluid and g a d s n accounts for fluid composing a droplet on the solid wall however huang et al 2007 show that g a d s n g a d s n 0 1 can span a wider contact angle range more accurately than g a d s n g a d s n as a result we compare the contact angles from both equations as shown in table 2 indeed the contact angles θ simulated by g a d s n g a d s n 0 1 are generally close to the theoretical values which are calculated by 17 tan θ l 2 r h where l is the length of the droplet bottom r is the radius of the droplet and h is the height of the droplet the relationship between contact angle and the value of g a d s n g a d s n is shown in fig 3 and is almost linear therefore the contact angles used in our simulations are determined by g a d s n g a d s n 0 1 then simulations were run using a regular pore network fig 4 to examine the influence of different contact angles although it is traditionally considered that the interface between wetting and nonwetting fluids is convex from nonwetting fluid to wetting fluid when the contact angle is less than 90 blunt 2001 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 we find that the interfaces are in fact dynamic being a function of contact angle and pore space geometry as fig 4a shows the interfaces indicated by green arrows are convex from nonwetting fluid to wetting fluid when the nonwetting fluid enters the pore space however when the interfaces reach the wall of the pore bodies and begin to invade a pore throat the interfaces indicated by black arrows become convex from the wetting fluid if the contact angle is above a critical value θc as a result both concave and convex interface geometries are present simultaneously in the domain similar behavior has been found also for intermediate wet systems contact angles in the range θ 60 100 rabbani et al 2016 a convex from the wetting fluid interface indicates that the wetting fluid pressure p w in the pore space is larger than that of the nonwetting fluid p nw even when the nonwetting fluid is invading the pore space when the contact angle is close to the critical value the interface becomes almost flat if it is below this value the interfaces are always convex from the nonwetting fluid indicated in fig 4b this critical value is related to the corner angle β of the pore space and is defined in degrees as θ c 90 β 2 ma et al 1996 in our simulations with rectangular pores the critical value is θ 45 this relationship has been used to describe drainage and imbibition in a polygonal tube ma et al 1996 our results demonstrate that it is also valid for pore bodies the contact angle and the corner angle of the pore space should be included in capillary pressure calculations for a pore body when the solid phase is not totally wetting because the interface geometry shows the change in p n w p w however it is usually assumed that there are no interface geometry dynamics in pore bodies and or that the solid phase is totally wetting which means the contact angle is equal to zero joekar niasar et al 2010 joekar niasar and majid hassanizadeh 2011 as a consequence both the contact angle and the corner angle of the pore space are usually neglected in capillary pressure calculations in pore bodies however if the solid phase surface is not totally wetting the study in rabbani et al 2016 also shows that the interface geometry can be altered in the intermediate wettability condition being determined by wettability and pore geometry together therefore calculation of the capillary pressure in a pore body of any dynamic pore network model should include the local wettability and pore geometry information when the solid phase surface is not totally wetting the influence of contact angle on miscible immiscible fluid interactions was then explored with contact values θ 65 and θ 40 considering a naturally heterogeneous pore structure see methods fig 2 the primary drainage phase begins with a fully saturated domain to generate a distribution of resident water after the saturation value becomes stable the imbibition phase then follows during drainage and imbibition the injection rate on the boundary is constant at v high from the young laplace equation p nw p w p c 2 γ cos θ r where p nw is the pressure of nonwetting fluid p w is the wetting fluid p c is the capillary pressure γ is the interfacial tension between two fluids and θ is the contact angle it is known that the capillary force is strengthened when the contact angle decreases which means that macroscopically more nonwetting fluid can be displaced with the same pore structure and boundary condition on the other hand it may be more difficult for wetting fluid to enter larger pore spaces as we expect at the start of the imbibition phase the saturation of resident water with lower contact angle is seen to be higher than that for the higher contact angle compare fig 5 a at 31 to fig 6 a at 25 below because stronger capillary forces retain water in the pore space after imbibition begins the saturation of the resident water drops very slowly fig 5a because the infiltrating water flows mainly through the narrow pore space because of capillary forces this trend continues until the infiltrating mixing water reaches the outlet at that point gradually the relative volume of resident water decreases faster with the infiltrating water invading more pore space in the direction orthogonal to the macroscopic flux in this way more resident water is flushed out or mixed with the infiltrating water at the end of the simulation the saturation of the resident water is stable and almost identical to the simulations with a larger contact angle fig 6a in contrast the saturation of the infiltrating water is larger compare fig 5a at 89 3 to fig 6a at 84 4 below the number of resident water clusters fig 5b is similar as well to that for the case with a larger contact angle value fig 6c this result demonstrates that an increased wetting surface area can improve the efficiency of imbibition rabbani et al 2017 although it does not significantly influence the interaction between the resident and infiltrating water 3 2 effect of boundary flux three fluxes v high v medium and v low are prescribed on the inlet boundary of the domain with a contact angle of θ 65 while all of the simulations describe resident infiltating water interactions within the capillary dominated regime we find that the interactions between resident and infiltrating water are influenced significantly by changes in the flux overall the resident water saturation decreases after imbibition of new water occurs the highest flux on the boundary has the highest residual resident water ratio at the completion of the imbibition phase compare fig 6a to b and fig 14a in the appendix section a 3 the ratio of residual resident water to the initial state is 33 9 so that one third of the resident water still remains in the pore space to compare the lowest boundary flux v low has a lower ratio of residual resident water to the initial state 8 4 fig 6b while the medium flux v medium on the inlet boundary also has a ratio of 29 1 fig 14 a to gain insight into the changes in resident water saturation observed above we also analyze how many residual water pockets remain and their change in size with lower boundary flux of infiltrating water the number of resident water pockets decreases as well fig 6c shows that 27 resident water pockets exist in the domain at the end of the imbibition phase for the boundary flux of v high simulations with the two lower boundary fluxes yield only 20 for v medium see appendix section a 3 fig 14b and 7 pockets for v low see fig 6d in each of their domains the changes in size of the resident water pockets are also investigated as shown in fig 6e most of the resident water pockets are relatively small which are represented from 0 to 100 pixels at the beginning of the simulation the number of these small resident water pockets decreases from 126 as the imbibition process continues ultimately only 17 small pockets remain in the system however large resident water pockets display a different trend with higher flux on the boundary their number decreased from 15 to 11 and sizes are relatively stable during the imbibition process which means that they barely mix with the infiltrating water to examine the degree of mixing between the resident and the infiltrating water the ratio of the resident water in the outflow is also analyzed when the imbibition of new water begins the main component of the outflow is the resident water fig 6f gradually the infiltrating water begins to replace the resident water in the outflow this replacement is faster when the flux on the boundary is higher fig 6f and at the end of the imbibition stage when equilibrium is reached there is almost no resident water in the outflow however the process is slower and the resident water is still the main component 50 70 in simulations with lower fluxes on the boundary see appendix section a 3 the findings above demonstrate that resident water is not totally replaced by infiltrating water especially when the flow rate on the boundary is relatively high the high flux on the boundary may cause a higher proportion of the resident water to remain in the pore space with essentially untouched large old water pockets the infiltrating water advances faster as it determines path s to the outlet as a result the resident water pockets on the paths are flushed out as the main component of the outflow in the early stages of the imbibition in parallel mixing between the resident and infiltrating water is repressed so that large resident water pockets are essentially untouched when the flux on the boundary is lower more mixing occurs and fewer resident water pockets remain 3 3 effect of body force while we focus our analysis on resident infiltrating water in the capillary dominated flow regime we can also explore the effect of body force gravity on interactions between resident and infiltrating water the bond number bo δρgb 2 σ where δρ denotes the density difference between two fluids water and air b is the characteristic length scale taken as the mean pore radius and σ is the surface tension is used here as a measure of the ratio between body and capillary forces in the simulations above bo 2 98 10 3 1 indicating that body force plays an insignificant role given that δρg can be conceptualized as a kind of unit body force we increase this body force by an order of magnitude so that bo 2 98 10 2 the simulations with the increased body force show little effect on interactions between resident and infiltrating water fig 7 a shows a residual saturation of resident water at the end of the imbibition phase of 11 2 similar to the value of 9 8 comparing to fig 6a with lower body force in contrast the saturation of the infiltrating water decreases from 84 4 fig 6a to 67 1 fig 7a as the body force increases these results indicate that while increasing the body force may not lead to a significant change in the path of infiltrating water to the outlet boundary increasing the body force within the capillary dominated regime may cause infiltrating water to advance faster with less invasion orthogonal to the macroscopic flow direction 3 4 effects of porosity porosity values of natural field soils and aquifer materials vary widely freeze and cherry 1979 so we investigate the effect of decreasing the porosity of the same pore structure examined in the preceding sections the porosity is decreased from 38 to 30 which is typical of natural sand and sandstone materials by uniformly increasing the sizes of solid particles in the simulation domain fig 2 while porosity is a macroscale parameter reducing the porosity in this manner also alters pore space geometry and reduces the overall connectivity the resulting changes in connectivity decrease the likelihood of interactions between resident and infiltrating water mousavi and bryant 2012 in parallel changes in the pore space geometry mainly in terms of smaller pore sizes result in increased entry pressures for nonwetting fluid considering a boundary flux of v low at the conclusion of the drainage phase the saturation of the resident water in the lower porosity domain is higher than that in the higher porosity domain 41 versus 35 8 compare fig 8 a to 6 b when the imbibition phase of new water begins the water preferentially infiltrates through narrow pore spaces because of capillary forces as seen in fig 8a the decrease in saturation of the resident water over time is relatively small from 41 to 30 1 in contrast the decrease in resident water saturation in the domain with higher porosity is more significant 35 8 to 4 1 moreover the number of resident water pockets is also much larger in the lower porosity domain compare fig 8b to 6d thus lower porosity domains are more likely to retain a larger relative amount of residual old water 3 5 3d simulation results to explore how the key factors identified for 2d systems influence immsicible miscible interactions among air residual water and infiltrating water in 3d several drainage imbibition cycle simulations with conditions similar to those for the 2d cases were completed using the structure shown in fig 9 this structure was generated by stacking 20 layers of part of the domain shown in fig 2 assuming a uniform layer thickness of one lattice unit with different boundary fluxes similar patterns of residual infiltrating water interactions were found as for the 2d cases specifically for the low flux on the inlet boundary the number of residual water pockets trapped in the pore space relative to the start of the simulation decreases from 6 to 4 fig 10 a and b and all of them are small as compared to the initial condition the final saturation of residual water was significantly lower fig 10b in contrast more residual water pockets remain in the pore space with the higher flux v high on the inlet boundary fig 10d and they are relatively large moreover the saturation of residual water is higher than for the lower flux case v low 13 4 vs 3 2 the same method implemented for the 2d domain was used to decrease the porosity of the 3d domain see section 3 4 to lower the porosity from 42 1 to 34 0 it is clear that decreasing porosity in 3d also causes more residual water to be retained in the pore space fig 11 8 pockets of residual water remain at the end of the simulation with a residual water saturation of 22 2 fig 11b note that the initial saturation is 39 7 fig 11a so that more than half of residual water remains in the pore space at the end of the simulation to compare significantly less residual water remains in the domain for the higher porosity case with the same flux on the inlet boundary fig 11d thus in general the behavior observed in the 2d domain simulations reported here are also valid for the 3d system we consider 4 conclusion in the present pore scale study lbm simulations conducted with different contact angles flux boundary conditions body force and porosity all within the capillary dominated flow regime highlight interactions between resident and infiltrating water with these interactions the amount of resident water generally decreases during imbibition of new water but it is not displaced completely from the pore space our results demonstrate that that contact angle and body force impact the distribution of resident water in the pore space only very slightly in contrast at the end of imbibition phase more residual old water is retained in the domain with relatively high flux on the inlet boundary and for domains with lower porosity higher inlet boundary fluxes enable the infiltrating water to define paths to the outlet more quickly which evidently displaces less residual old water infiltrating water has less opportunity to mix with the old water as a result too compared to the imbibition at low boundary fluxes more resident water pockets exist with regard to structural effects decreasing the porosity then decreases the pore space connectivity and the pore sizes for the same boundary conditions more residual water pockets are isolated or bypassed by infiltrating water thus we demonstrate that inlet boundary flux and medium porosity are the dominant factors influencing interactions between residual and infiltrating water although it is difficult to extrapolate the pore scale phenomena demonstrated here directly to the field scale clear connections can be delineated fig 12 shows the ratio of resident water volume in the outflows of two field systems when the influx of new infiltrating water to soil is relatively high as given in fig 12a the proportion of resident water in the outflow decreases relatively quickly when the influx is lower the decrease in the proportion of resident water in the outflow is altered significantly fig 12b both of these phenomena are also apparent in our simulations however critically our pore scale simulations indicate that a lack of resident water in the outflow does not mean that there is no or very little residual water in the pore space on the contrary resident old can remain longer and the tailing behavior may be a function of the mixing between resident and infiltrating water in general resident water remains stable in soils and is not completely mixed with or displaced by infiltrating water a key implication of this analysis is that resident water may be largely available for vegetation because it is not totally flushed during episodes of infiltration and remains stable in some regions of the pore space moreover in accord with field observations in a mediterranean climate brooks et al 2010 our analysis demonstrates that domains with lower porosity or smaller pore sizes may reduce the amount of resident water replaced during imbibition phases as a consequence this residual water is generally accessible to roots of plants in contrast infiltrating water is the source of surface runoff and recharge to groundwater the latter occurring through relatively large pores and cracks as demonstrated in our simulations recent field studies further indicate this co existence between pockets of new and old water and the mechanism of infiltrating water bypassing rather than displacing old water are prevalent under most field conditions around the world evaristo et al 2015 the results of the pore scale simulations presented here lend quantitative mechanistic insight into

we choose f i n x t f i n x e i t a2 conversion of units in the lattice boltzmann method the physical space is converted to the lattice space which is based on keeping the value of a dimensionless number e g reynolds number capillary number the flux boundary was used on the inlet so the flux rate in the lattice space can be determined using the reynolds number as 31 r e r e u n r c h a r ν u n r c h a r ν n where un is the darcy velocity of the fluid n on the inlet boundary rchar is the characteristic mean pore radius ν is the kinematic viscosity and means lattice parameters since all the

other hand the viscosity ratio between two fluids m and n is 33 m ν m ν n ν m ν n as a result the other fluid kinematic viscosity can be determined by ν m m ν n then the relaxation time is calculated

coefficient to the dimensionless value in lbm d l b m d δ t δ x 2 a3 comparison for the miscible fluids interactions simulated by lbm and openfoam to validate that the lattice boltzmann model is able to simulate the mixing process between miscible fluids e g old new water a series of simulations in a single pore were run by lbm and the twoliquidmixingfoam solver of openfoam to compare their results with different values of pé the process was set up in a single regular pore 1 2 mm 1 0 mm and it was meshed to 40 30 grids for the simulations the diffusion coefficient d was chosen to be 2 0 10 9 m s 2 for the openfoam solver it was then converted to the equivalent value in lbm using the method described in a 2 the initial condition was v x y t 0 0 0 with the relative concentration of new water c x 0 5 mm y t 0 1 and c x 0 5 mm y t 0 0 the boundary conditions for flow and the relative concentration of new water were constant velocity and constant concentration c i n 1 0 respectively the values of the velocity depend on the choices of pé because the diffusion coefficient and characteristic length were fixed for the outlet boundary a free flux boundary condition was chosen for both flow and the relative concentration of new water the mixing processes with pé 3 and pé 30 are compared in fig 13 it is seen that lbm results generally match those of openfoam so that lbm captures the characteristics of mixing processes between miscible fluids in the range of pé calculated from our simulations 3 pé 30 a4 additional results temporal evolution of resident and infiltrating water we show here temporal evolution of resident and infiltrating water interaction dynamics for the case of an intermediate boundary flux v medium and a comparison of ratios of resident water in the outflow

759,we quantify the poorly understood interactions between resident and infiltrating water during drainage imbibition cycles in heterogeneous porous media via a 2 d and 3 d lattice boltzmann simulation method these interactions are critical in the partially saturated soil layer which is the interface from land surface to groundwater that controls the fate and transport of infiltrating water and chemicals to aquifers the results demonstrate the sensitivity of these dynamic interactions to the contact angle boundary flux condition body force and porosity we show that the body force and contact angle have relatively small effects on interactions in the capillary flow regime while the boundary flux and porosity alter the amount and distribution of resident and infiltrating water significantly moreover air water interfaces are shown to be dynamically concave convex determined by both contact angle and pore geometry our analysis demonstrates the coexistence of distinct pockets of resident and infiltrating water and provides pore scale mechanistic evidence that supports field observations of soil water zones with different chemical signatures keywords resident infiltrating water interactions drainage imbibition cycle lattice boltzmann method lbm shan chen model 1 introduction the vadose or partially saturated zone plays a significant role in the environment because it is the critical interface from land surface to groundwater that controls the fate and transport of both infiltrating water and chemicals imbibition and drainage processes in this multicomponent multiphase system have been a subject of intense study for decades field experiments have been carried out to characterize flow patterns and related transport phenomena ghodrati and jury 1990 hill and parlange 1972 ritsema et al 1993 and noninvasive measurement techniques and numerical modeling methods have been developed to explore the pore scale details of fluid distributions pohlmeier et al 2008 porter and wildenschild 2010 sněhota et al 2010 dynamic interactions between fluids galindo torres et al 2013 porter et al 2009 and contaminant transport luo et al 2008 raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 however these efforts have focused mainly on the immiscible interaction between water and air and related phenomena the actual interaction between resident and infiltrating water which occurs during cycles of drainage and imbibition has received little attention notwithstanding recognition that patterns of fluid migration and chemical mixing between resident and infiltrating water are highly non uniform and heterogeneous and that resident and infiltrating waters can maintain different chemical signatures in this context several field experiments using non reactive tracers showed not only that resident water is the main component of outflow in soil profiles when infiltration rainfall first occurs but also that resident water is retained in the soil for hours days and even years collins et al 2000 turton et al 1995 mass exchange between immobile water resident water and mobile infiltrating water can continue for tens of years gvirtzman et al 1988 moreover a series of field measurements of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicated that precipitation which supplies groundwater recharge and streamflow is different from the water that supplies some soil water recharge and plant transpiration brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 mcdonnell 2017 similar measurements also showed that pore water in peat profiles is flushed out mainly by recharge from the near surface peat levy et al 2016 all of these field observations challenge the classical assumption that resident water in soil mixes with and or is displaced fully by infiltrating water and indicate the occurrence of different mechanisms of interaction between resident and infiltrating water various mathematical frameworks that include models for water mixing have been proposed to quantify these phenomena botter et al 2010 2011 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 weiler et al 2003 for example in catchments incorporation of soil moisture dynamics to express travel time of water in soil has been proposed botter et al 2010 with soil water conceptualized as mobile and immobile immobile water can become mobilized during rainfall events such a model mimics mixing processes between old and new water but assumes that the rainfall mobilized immobile water involves randomly all of the available regions and ages of water in the soil and does not provide any information at the pore scale in parallel several laboratory experiments and numerical studies gouet kaplan et al 2012 gouet kaplan and berkowitz 2011 gouet kaplan et al 2009 explored pore scale interactions between resident and infiltrating water these studies identified three mechanisms of interaction between resident and infiltrating water 1 displacement and flow of resident water pockets as they became connected to new channels 2 partial or full mixing of resident water with infiltrating water 3 diffusive transfer of solute from old water to new water as new water flows through a channel these analyses however are limited to high porosities and or regular pore structures that are not fully representative of natural soils as well as to a narrow range of hydraulic conditions here to examine the effects of complex soil geometry and topology on interactions between resident and infiltrating water we implement a lattice boltzmann method lbm with two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d irregular pore structures for capillary flow regime for the scenarios we examine here which focus on the interplay between resident and infiltrating water during a cycle of drainage and imbibition the modified shan chen model is chosen two other principal lbm models for multicomponent multiphase flow color gradient and free energy have natural advantages for dealing with higher viscosity leclaire et al 2017 and density ratios shao et al 2014 zheng et al 2006 however these models target two component two phase immiscible fluid systems and it is difficult to include additional fluids these models are thus less suitable for treating a scenario such as the one of interest here which involves interaction of three fluid air resident water and infiltrating water in the domain to account for miscible processes e g mixing between two fluids one fluid can be treated as a solute relative to the other fluid in a multicomponent multiphase shan chen model by eliminating or significantly reducing local interactions between them sukop and thorne 2006 shan and doolen 1995 also showed that the multiphase multicomponent shan chen lbm model can recover the advection diffusion equation using the chapman enskog expansion on the other hand the shan chen model which has an explicit force scheme with an especially high isotropy scheme has been shown to handle effectively high viscosity ratios between fluids porter et al 2012 moreover it has been demonstrated that the influence of a high density ratio can be neglected when the flow is in the capillary regime schaap et al 2007 thus the multiphase multicomponent shan chen lbm model is capable of simulating the immscible miscible fluid flow process of interest here with more complex pore structures we investigate how various factors boundary flux condition wettability body force and porosity influence the interactions between the resident and infiltrating water our results demonstrate that the boundary flux and the pore structure can affect the amount and distribution of resident and infiltrating water significantly while wettability and body force are less influential these pore scale simulations provide mechanistic evidence that supports field observations of resident and infiltrating water interactions resident infiltrating water interactions are also affected by the air water interface geometry which is shown to be dynamic the interface between air and water evolves and varies between convex and concave which is determined not only by contact angle but also by the geometry of the pore space 2 method 2 1 lattice boltzmann method the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a discretized form of the boltzmann equation and derived from the bgk approximation in this method the discrete distribution function fi is introduced to represent fluid particles in certain directions as shown in fig 1 and satisfies the equation 1 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t 1 τ f x t f i e q x t where fi is the distribution function for fluid particles in the direction of discrete velocity e i and τ is the relaxation rate related to the kinematic viscosity ν 1 3 τ 1 2 the equilibrium function f i e q is usually calculated as 2 f i e q w i ρ 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where wi is the weight coefficient whose value depends on the direction i ρ is the macroscopic density calculated as ρ i 0 n f i and u is the macroscopic velocity given by u 1 ρ i 0 n f i e i it has been shown that the navier stokes equation can be recovered from the lbm eqs 1 and 2 using the chapman enskog expansion chen and doolen 1998 the basic idea in the shan chen model is to incorporate interaction forces between fluid particles by means of 3 f σ n g c ψ n x t n n i 1 w i ψ n x e i δ t t e i where n and n denote the different fluids ψ is the potential of fluid at the location x and is calculated from different equations of state gc is the interaction strength coefficient which controls the cohesion force between fluids when gc is positive the fluids repel each other when gc is negative the force is cohesive this form of the force between fluids indicates that the number of fluid types is limited only by computational resources here the infiltrating water is treated as the third fluid with its own particle distribution function f i i w macroscopic density ρiw and other parameters when the imbibition starts the interactions with air and resident water are also calculated by eq 3 the force between fluids and solid phase is calculated in a similar manner 4 f a d s n x t g a d s n ρ x t i 1 w i s x e i δ t e i where g ads n is the interaction strength coefficient for nth fluid to solid cohesion and s x e i δ t is the indicator function of solid phase 1 solid phase 0 void space for fluid whether the fluid is wetting or non wetting is adjusted by changing the value of g ads n from negative to positive which means that g ads n determines the contact angle the total force for each fluid is 5 f n f σ n f a d s n if a certain type of body force is required to be included f n b will be added to this equation to integrate fluid fluid cohesion and fluid solid cohesion into the lbm the original shan chen model replaces the velocity u in eq 2 with macroscopic equilibrium velocity u eq 6 u n e q u τ n f n ρ n where the velocity u is defined as 7 u n ρ n u τ n n ρ n τ n schaap et al 2007 showed that the original shan chen model can be applied to simulate water air drainage and imbibition processes when the capillary force is dominant and the relaxation rates are the same when the viscous force cannot be neglected or a larger viscosity ratio is included in the simulation another way of integrating force f n is implemented porter et al 2012 8 f i n x e i δ t t δ t f i n x t ω c o l l n δ t 2 f i f n x e i δ t t δ t f i f n x t moreover compared to the original shan chen method this approach also makes surface tension between two fluids independent of the viscosity ratio between them porter et al 2012 the collision term ω c o l l n is the same as the right part of eq 1 without the force term the external force term here is calculated as 9 f i f n f n e i u eq ρ n c s 2 f i eq n where fn is the sum of all external and body forces for the nth component cs is the so called sound speed in lbm u eq is different from the equilibrium velocity in eq 6 compared to the original shan chen method which includes the external and body forces through adding the force term to the effective velocity the forces in the explicit force method are incorporated directly into the distribution function as eq 8 therefore the effective velocity in eq 7 is usually used here for u eq of each fluid component but the momentum conservation is still retained the original distribution function is transformed to 10 f i n f i n δ t 2 f i f n and then applied to eq 8 for both f i n at time step t and t δ t we obtain 11 f i n x e i δ t t δ t δ t 2 f i f n x e i δ t t δ t f i n x t δ t 2 f i f n x t 1 τ n f i e q n x t f i n x t δ t 2 f i f n x t δ t 2 f i f n x e i δ t t δ t f i f n x t clearly the force term of the next step can be canceled on both sides of the equation finally the explicit force scheme is 12 f i n x e i δ t t δ t f i n e i t 1 τ n f i eq n x t f i n x t δ t 2 f i f n δ t f i f n the macroscopic parameters density and momentum of each fluid are calculated as 13 ρ n i f i n 14 ρ n u i f i n e i δ t 2 f n thus the transformed distribution function f i n can be used to calculate the macroscopic parameters of the system therefore the transformation in eq 10 only needs to be implemented at the beginning of the simulation which saves the computational cost as well 2 2 numerical experiments the simulations are in 2d so the lbm scheme here is d2q9 prior to running simulations with the binary image shown in fig 2 the contact angle and interface evolution tests were run in a binary fluid system and regular pores to confirm that the interface characteristics between immsicible fluids water and air are captured correctly subsequently simulations of drainage imbibition cycles to investigate the interplay between resident and infiltrating water were run with the image fig 2 the size of the domain is 73 2 33 1 mm and the porosity is 38 2 the minimum maximum and mean pore space diameters are 0 046 mm 2 66 mm and 1 48 mm respectively the resolution of a pixel is 0 046 mm 46 µm while current x ray tomography reaches higher resolutions the image used here was sufficient for the purposes of this study which required correct identification of the location and movement of the interface in related contexts similar resolutions were employed by others porter et al 2009 schaap et al 2007 in each simulation a neumann constant flux rate inlet boundary condition is prescribed on the left side of the structure the method zou and he 1997 proposed is the most common one but here we apply a method chang et al 2009 that has a smoother pressure gradient see appendix section a 1 the outlet boundary is prescribed as a zero gradient boundary lou et al 2013 the top and the bottom are set up as periodic boundary conditions and the macroscopic flow is from left to right in the domain to reach the component separation between water and air the interaction strength coefficient is based on numerical experiments huang et al 2007 porter et al 2012 which can minimize diffusion between the two fluids in our case air and water phases on the other hand the resident and infiltrating waters are considered to be fluids having the same properties so that the interaction coefficient is set up to be below the threshold of separating the two fluids as table 1 shows air and water are set to have different relaxation rates and viscosity values conversion of physical units to lattice units while maintaining the same time step is explained in the appendix section a 2 all of the simulations start with the initial condition that the domain is fully saturated air then enters the domain at a constant rate until the flow in the domain is in steady state the inlet boundary condition is then replaced by imbibition of water this boundary condition is maintained until steady state conditions are reached again following pan et al 2006 and yang 2013 steady state conditions are considered to be reached for 15 m u x t u x t 100 2 m u x 5 2 10 6 or 16 s r w t s r w t 100 s r w t 100 10 6 due to the data structure of lbm all of the equations are solved numerically using graphic processing units nvidia tesla k40 gpu cards in this way simulation run times are reduced to durations of a few days 3 results and analysis all of the drainage imbibition simulations were in the capillary flow domain with capillary numbers ca in the range 10 5 10 4 c a v i n η i n σ where vin and ηin are the mean velocity and dynamic viscosity of displacing fluids at the inlet respectively σ is the surface tension and with a viscosity ratio of 15 m ν w ν a to confirm that the lbm is capable of capturing the characteristics of mixing between resident and infiltrating water lbm solutions for such a displacement process in a single regular pore 1 2 mm 1 0 mm were compared to those obtained with openfoam the openfoam software package for open source field operation and manipulation is a c toolbox of finite volume numerical solvers for continuum mechanics including computational fluid dynamics cfd weller et al 1998 it was found that the lbm solutions were very similar to those of the twoliquidmixingfoam solver in openfoam when the péclet number pé v m e a n d c h a r d where vmean and dchar are the mean velocty in the pore space and the mean pore space diameter respectively d is the diffusion coefficient of the fluid was about 30 above this value the lbm solution may underestimate the degree of mixing by several percent the values of pé in the simulations considered here were generally in the range of 3 30 only for vhigh did pé values in a few pores reach as high as 90 as a consequence for the scenarios considered here the main characteristics of mixing between resident and infiltrating water can be captured moreover by using the approach described here of integrating the force term spurious currents around interfaces were suppressed typical lattice velocities in the pores were of the order of 10 4 l u t 1 and velocities around the air water interfaces increased compared to the neighboring area but were usually of the same order only when the interface moved through very narrow pore spaces equivalent to less than 10 pixels in the image did the magnitude sometimes reach the order of 10 3 l u t 1 in contrast for example simulation of air water interactions in a static bubble in a gravity free fully periodic domain indicated that most of the lattice velocities were in the range 10 5 l u t 1 10 4 l u t 1 note also that shan chen lbm simulations have been shown to be reliable at low velocities and capillary numbers 10 8 10 5 huang et al 2009 schaap et al 2007 3 1 effects of contact angle simulations were first carried out to test the effect of contact angle usually the parameters for the interactions between the fluids and the solid phase are g a d s n g a d s n where g ads n accounts for the surrounding fluid and g a d s n accounts for fluid composing a droplet on the solid wall however huang et al 2007 show that g a d s n g a d s n 0 1 can span a wider contact angle range more accurately than g a d s n g a d s n as a result we compare the contact angles from both equations as shown in table 2 indeed the contact angles θ simulated by g a d s n g a d s n 0 1 are generally close to the theoretical values which are calculated by 17 tan θ l 2 r h where l is the length of the droplet bottom r is the radius of the droplet and h is the height of the droplet the relationship between contact angle and the value of g a d s n g a d s n is shown in fig 3 and is almost linear therefore the contact angles used in our simulations are determined by g a d s n g a d s n 0 1 then simulations were run using a regular pore network fig 4 to examine the influence of different contact angles although it is traditionally considered that the interface between wetting and nonwetting fluids is convex from nonwetting fluid to wetting fluid when the contact angle is less than 90 blunt 2001 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 we find that the interfaces are in fact dynamic being a function of contact angle and pore space geometry as fig 4a shows the interfaces indicated by green arrows are convex from nonwetting fluid to wetting fluid when the nonwetting fluid enters the pore space however when the interfaces reach the wall of the pore bodies and begin to invade a pore throat the interfaces indicated by black arrows become convex from the wetting fluid if the contact angle is above a critical value θc as a result both concave and convex interface geometries are present simultaneously in the domain similar behavior has been found also for intermediate wet systems contact angles in the range θ 60 100 rabbani et al 2016 a convex from the wetting fluid interface indicates that the wetting fluid pressure p w in the pore space is larger than that of the nonwetting fluid p nw even when the nonwetting fluid is invading the pore space when the contact angle is close to the critical value the interface becomes almost flat if it is below this value the interfaces are always convex from the nonwetting fluid indicated in fig 4b this critical value is related to the corner angle β of the pore space and is defined in degrees as θ c 90 β 2 ma et al 1996 in our simulations with rectangular pores the critical value is θ 45 this relationship has been used to describe drainage and imbibition in a polygonal tube ma et al 1996 our results demonstrate that it is also valid for pore bodies the contact angle and the corner angle of the pore space should be included in capillary pressure calculations for a pore body when the solid phase is not totally wetting because the interface geometry shows the change in p n w p w however it is usually assumed that there are no interface geometry dynamics in pore bodies and or that the solid phase is totally wetting which means the contact angle is equal to zero joekar niasar et al 2010 joekar niasar and majid hassanizadeh 2011 as a consequence both the contact angle and the corner angle of the pore space are usually neglected in capillary pressure calculations in pore bodies however if the solid phase surface is not totally wetting the study in rabbani et al 2016 also shows that the interface geometry can be altered in the intermediate wettability condition being determined by wettability and pore geometry together therefore calculation of the capillary pressure in a pore body of any dynamic pore network model should include the local wettability and pore geometry information when the solid phase surface is not totally wetting the influence of contact angle on miscible immiscible fluid interactions was then explored with contact values θ 65 and θ 40 considering a naturally heterogeneous pore structure see methods fig 2 the primary drainage phase begins with a fully saturated domain to generate a distribution of resident water after the saturation value becomes stable the imbibition phase then follows during drainage and imbibition the injection rate on the boundary is constant at v high from the young laplace equation p nw p w p c 2 γ cos θ r where p nw is the pressure of nonwetting fluid p w is the wetting fluid p c is the capillary pressure γ is the interfacial tension between two fluids and θ is the contact angle it is known that the capillary force is strengthened when the contact angle decreases which means that macroscopically more nonwetting fluid can be displaced with the same pore structure and boundary condition on the other hand it may be more difficult for wetting fluid to enter larger pore spaces as we expect at the start of the imbibition phase the saturation of resident water with lower contact angle is seen to be higher than that for the higher contact angle compare fig 5 a at 31 to fig 6 a at 25 below because stronger capillary forces retain water in the pore space after imbibition begins the saturation of the resident water drops very slowly fig 5a because the infiltrating water flows mainly through the narrow pore space because of capillary forces this trend continues until the infiltrating mixing water reaches the outlet at that point gradually the relative volume of resident water decreases faster with the infiltrating water invading more pore space in the direction orthogonal to the macroscopic flux in this way more resident water is flushed out or mixed with the infiltrating water at the end of the simulation the saturation of the resident water is stable and almost identical to the simulations with a larger contact angle fig 6a in contrast the saturation of the infiltrating water is larger compare fig 5a at 89 3 to fig 6a at 84 4 below the number of resident water clusters fig 5b is similar as well to that for the case with a larger contact angle value fig 6c this result demonstrates that an increased wetting surface area can improve the efficiency of imbibition rabbani et al 2017 although it does not significantly influence the interaction between the resident and infiltrating water 3 2 effect of boundary flux three fluxes v high v medium and v low are prescribed on the inlet boundary of the domain with a contact angle of θ 65 while all of the simulations describe resident infiltating water interactions within the capillary dominated regime we find that the interactions between resident and infiltrating water are influenced significantly by changes in the flux overall the resident water saturation decreases after imbibition of new water occurs the highest flux on the boundary has the highest residual resident water ratio at the completion of the imbibition phase compare fig 6a to b and fig 14a in the appendix section a 3 the ratio of residual resident water to the initial state is 33 9 so that one third of the resident water still remains in the pore space to compare the lowest boundary flux v low has a lower ratio of residual resident water to the initial state 8 4 fig 6b while the medium flux v medium on the inlet boundary also has a ratio of 29 1 fig 14 a to gain insight into the changes in resident water saturation observed above we also analyze how many residual water pockets remain and their change in size with lower boundary flux of infiltrating water the number of resident water pockets decreases as well fig 6c shows that 27 resident water pockets exist in the domain at the end of the imbibition phase for the boundary flux of v high simulations with the two lower boundary fluxes yield only 20 for v medium see appendix section a 3 fig 14b and 7 pockets for v low see fig 6d in each of their domains the changes in size of the resident water pockets are also investigated as shown in fig 6e most of the resident water pockets are relatively small which are represented from 0 to 100 pixels at the beginning of the simulation the number of these small resident water pockets decreases from 126 as the imbibition process continues ultimately only 17 small pockets remain in the system however large resident water pockets display a different trend with higher flux on the boundary their number decreased from 15 to 11 and sizes are relatively stable during the imbibition process which means that they barely mix with the infiltrating water to examine the degree of mixing between the resident and the infiltrating water the ratio of the resident water in the outflow is also analyzed when the imbibition of new water begins the main component of the outflow is the resident water fig 6f gradually the infiltrating water begins to replace the resident water in the outflow this replacement is faster when the flux on the boundary is higher fig 6f and at the end of the imbibition stage when equilibrium is reached there is almost no resident water in the outflow however the process is slower and the resident water is still the main component 50 70 in simulations with lower fluxes on the boundary see appendix section a 3 the findings above demonstrate that resident water is not totally replaced by infiltrating water especially when the flow rate on the boundary is relatively high the high flux on the boundary may cause a higher proportion of the resident water to remain in the pore space with essentially untouched large old water pockets the infiltrating water advances faster as it determines path s to the outlet as a result the resident water pockets on the paths are flushed out as the main component of the outflow in the early stages of the imbibition in parallel mixing between the resident and infiltrating water is repressed so that large resident water pockets are essentially untouched when the flux on the boundary is lower more mixing occurs and fewer resident water pockets remain 3 3 effect of body force while we focus our analysis on resident infiltrating water in the capillary dominated flow regime we can also explore the effect of body force gravity on interactions between resident and infiltrating water the bond number bo δρgb 2 σ where δρ denotes the density difference between two fluids water and air b is the characteristic length scale taken as the mean pore radius and σ is the surface tension is used here as a measure of the ratio between body and capillary forces in the simulations above bo 2 98 10 3 1 indicating that body force plays an insignificant role given that δρg can be conceptualized as a kind of unit body force we increase this body force by an order of magnitude so that bo 2 98 10 2 the simulations with the increased body force show little effect on interactions between resident and infiltrating water fig 7 a shows a residual saturation of resident water at the end of the imbibition phase of 11 2 similar to the value of 9 8 comparing to fig 6a with lower body force in contrast the saturation of the infiltrating water decreases from 84 4 fig 6a to 67 1 fig 7a as the body force increases these results indicate that while increasing the body force may not lead to a significant change in the path of infiltrating water to the outlet boundary increasing the body force within the capillary dominated regime may cause infiltrating water to advance faster with less invasion orthogonal to the macroscopic flow direction 3 4 effects of porosity porosity values of natural field soils and aquifer materials vary widely freeze and cherry 1979 so we investigate the effect of decreasing the porosity of the same pore structure examined in the preceding sections the porosity is decreased from 38 to 30 which is typical of natural sand and sandstone materials by uniformly increasing the sizes of solid particles in the simulation domain fig 2 while porosity is a macroscale parameter reducing the porosity in this manner also alters pore space geometry and reduces the overall connectivity the resulting changes in connectivity decrease the likelihood of interactions between resident and infiltrating water mousavi and bryant 2012 in parallel changes in the pore space geometry mainly in terms of smaller pore sizes result in increased entry pressures for nonwetting fluid considering a boundary flux of v low at the conclusion of the drainage phase the saturation of the resident water in the lower porosity domain is higher than that in the higher porosity domain 41 versus 35 8 compare fig 8 a to 6 b when the imbibition phase of new water begins the water preferentially infiltrates through narrow pore spaces because of capillary forces as seen in fig 8a the decrease in saturation of the resident water over time is relatively small from 41 to 30 1 in contrast the decrease in resident water saturation in the domain with higher porosity is more significant 35 8 to 4 1 moreover the number of resident water pockets is also much larger in the lower porosity domain compare fig 8b to 6d thus lower porosity domains are more likely to retain a larger relative amount of residual old water 3 5 3d simulation results to explore how the key factors identified for 2d systems influence immsicible miscible interactions among air residual water and infiltrating water in 3d several drainage imbibition cycle simulations with conditions similar to those for the 2d cases were completed using the structure shown in fig 9 this structure was generated by stacking 20 layers of part of the domain shown in fig 2 assuming a uniform layer thickness of one lattice unit with different boundary fluxes similar patterns of residual infiltrating water interactions were found as for the 2d cases specifically for the low flux on the inlet boundary the number of residual water pockets trapped in the pore space relative to the start of the simulation decreases from 6 to 4 fig 10 a and b and all of them are small as compared to the initial condition the final saturation of residual water was significantly lower fig 10b in contrast more residual water pockets remain in the pore space with the higher flux v high on the inlet boundary fig 10d and they are relatively large moreover the saturation of residual water is higher than for the lower flux case v low 13 4 vs 3 2 the same method implemented for the 2d domain was used to decrease the porosity of the 3d domain see section 3 4 to lower the porosity from 42 1 to 34 0 it is clear that decreasing porosity in 3d also causes more residual water to be retained in the pore space fig 11 8 pockets of residual water remain at the end of the simulation with a residual water saturation of 22 2 fig 11b note that the initial saturation is 39 7 fig 11a so that more than half of residual water remains in the pore space at the end of the simulation to compare significantly less residual water remains in the domain for the higher porosity case with the same flux on the inlet boundary fig 11d thus in general the behavior observed in the 2d domain simulations reported here are also valid for the 3d system we consider 4 conclusion in the present pore scale study lbm simulations conducted with different contact angles flux boundary conditions body force and porosity all within the capillary dominated flow regime highlight interactions between resident and infiltrating water with these interactions the amount of resident water generally decreases during imbibition of new water but it is not displaced completely from the pore space our results demonstrate that that contact angle and body force impact the distribution of resident water in the pore space only very slightly in contrast at the end of imbibition phase more residual old water is retained in the domain with relatively high flux on the inlet boundary and for domains with lower porosity higher inlet boundary fluxes enable the infiltrating water to define paths to the outlet more quickly which evidently displaces less residual old water infiltrating water has less opportunity to mix with the old water as a result too compared to the imbibition at low boundary fluxes more resident water pockets exist with regard to structural effects decreasing the porosity then decreases the pore space connectivity and the pore sizes for the same boundary conditions more residual water pockets are isolated or bypassed by infiltrating water thus we demonstrate that inlet boundary flux and medium porosity are the dominant factors influencing interactions between residual and infiltrating water although it is difficult to extrapolate the pore scale phenomena demonstrated here directly to the field scale clear connections can be delineated fig 12 shows the ratio of resident water volume in the outflows of two field systems when the influx of new infiltrating water to soil is relatively high as given in fig 12a the proportion of resident water in the outflow decreases relatively quickly when the influx is lower the decrease in the proportion of resident water in the outflow is altered significantly fig 12b both of these phenomena are also apparent in our simulations however critically our pore scale simulations indicate that a lack of resident water in the outflow does not mean that there is no or very little residual water in the pore space on the contrary resident old can remain longer and the tailing behavior may be a function of the mixing between resident and infiltrating water in general resident water remains stable in soils and is not completely mixed with or displaced by infiltrating water a key implication of this analysis is that resident water may be largely available for vegetation because it is not totally flushed during episodes of infiltration and remains stable in some regions of the pore space moreover in accord with field observations in a mediterranean climate brooks et al 2010 our analysis demonstrates that domains with lower porosity or smaller pore sizes may reduce the amount of resident water replaced during imbibition phases as a consequence this residual water is generally accessible to roots of plants in contrast infiltrating water is the source of surface runoff and recharge to groundwater the latter occurring through relatively large pores and cracks as demonstrated in our simulations recent field studies further indicate this co existence between pockets of new and old water and the mechanism of infiltrating water bypassing rather than displacing old water are prevalent under most field conditions around the world evaristo et al 2015 the results of the pore scale simulations presented here lend quantitative mechanistic insight into the dominant controls leading to the existence of stable soil water zones with different chemical signatures acknowledgments b b gratefully acknowledges the support of a research grant from rochelle

we choose f i n x t f i n x e i t a2 conversion of units in the lattice boltzmann method the physical space is converted to the lattice space which is based on keeping the value of a dimensionless number e g reynolds number capillary number the flux boundary was used on the inlet so the flux rate in the lattice space can be determined using the reynolds number as 31 r e r e u n r c h a r ν u n r c h a r ν n where un is the darcy velocity of the fluid n on the inlet boundary rchar is the characteristic mean pore radius ν is the kinematic viscosity and means lattice parameters since all the physical parameters are known and the value of ν is calculated from the supposed value of the relaxation time τ so the velocity in the lattice space is 32 v n u r c h a r ν n ν n r c h a r on the other hand the viscosity ratio between two fluids m and n is 33 m ν m ν n ν m ν n as a result the other fluid kinematic viscosity can be determined by ν m m ν n then the relaxation time is calculated from τ i 3 ν i 0 5 i m n to know how many seconds in the physical space is equal to one time step δt the calculation is 34 δ t u n δ x u n where δx is one grid length in the physical space therefore n

to simulate the mixing process between miscible fluids e g old new water a series of simulations in a single pore were run by lbm and the twoliquidmixingfoam solver of openfoam to compare their results with different values of pé the process was set up in a single regular pore 1 2 mm 1 0 mm and it was meshed to 40 30 grids for the simulations the diffusion coefficient d was chosen to be 2 0 10 9 m s 2 for the openfoam solver it was then converted to the equivalent value in lbm using the method described in a 2 the initial condition was v x y t 0 0 0 with the relative concentration of new water c x 0 5 mm y t 0 1 and c x 0 5 mm y t 0 0 the boundary conditions for flow and the relative concentration of new water were constant velocity and constant concentration c i n 1 0 respectively the values of the velocity depend on the choices of pé because the diffusion coefficient and characteristic length were fixed for the outlet boundary a free flux boundary condition was chosen for both flow and the relative concentration of new water the mixing processes with pé 3 and pé 30 are compared in fig 13 it is seen that lbm results generally match those of openfoam so that lbm captures the characteristics of mixing processes between miscible fluids in the range of pé calculated from our simulations 3 pé 30 a4 additional results temporal evolution of resident and infiltrating water we
