21855,a robust adaptive prescribed performance control rappc law is proposed for dynamic positioning dp of ships subject to unknown time varying disturbances with the control input magnitude and rate constraints a simple error mapping function is first constructed to achieve the dp prescribed performance control design next an adaptive disturbance observer is proposed to online estimate the unknown time varying disturbances and an auxiliary dynamic system is introduced to addresses the effects of the input magnitude and rate constraints then incorporating the above into the dynamic surface control method the dp control law with prescribed performance is proposed theoretical analysis and simulation results prove that the proposed dp rappc law makes the ship s position and heading be maintained at the desired values with prescribed positioning performance keywords dynamic positioning of ships input magnitude and rate constraints adaptive disturbance observer auxiliary dynamic system prescribed performance 1 introduction a dynamic positioning dp system allows an autonomous floating structure such as a platform or a ship to automatically keep its position and heading at the desired values by using its own thrusters propellers and rudders sørensen 2011 shi et al 2017 with the ocean exploitation and exploration further developing to the distant and deep ocean the dp systems are widely used in the field of ocean engineering as pipe laying drilling hydrographic surveying and ocean observation hassani et al 2013 fossen 1994 li et al 2018 however ships inevitably suffer from changeable and unpredictable ocean environmental disturbances furthermore the magnitude and the rate of change of the command control forces and moment are constrained because of the physical limitations of a ship s propulsion system hence dp control design should take into account the effects of the disturbances and constraints to ensure high dp performance in the presence of unknown constant disturbances the dp adaptive robust output feedback control scheme was developed incorporating an adaptive state observer into the vectorial backstepping method in do 2011 to deal with wave and low frequency disturbances a passive observer was constructed to online estimate the ship s low frequency position velocities and slow varying disturbances in fossen and strand 1999 using this passive observer a dp robust control scheme was proposed in loria et al 2000 nevertheless the passive observer in fossen and strand 1999 loria et al 2000 requires disturbances priori knowledge for ships operating in unpredictable and varying sea states a dp hybrid control strategy based on supervisory switching logic was developed in nguyen et al 2007 where different control laws and wave filters can be switched automatically in terms of different sea states under the conditions of model parameter perturbations as well as time varying disturbances a dp sliding mode control scheme was developed for a turret moored floating production storage and offloading system in tannuri et al 2001 a dp robust h control scheme was designed in katebi et al 2001 and a dp robust control scheme using h and mixed μ methods was given in hassani et al 2017 respectively in the presence of unknown time varying disturbances many researchers proposed different dp schemes hu et al 2015 2017 du et al 2018 brodtkorb et al 2018 vaernø et al 2017 2019a 2019b zhao et al 2019 hu et al 2015 proposed an adaptive fuzzy dp control scheme where the uncertainties arising from unknown time varying disturbances were approximated by adaptive fuzzy system hu et al 2017 and du et al 2018 proposed the robust adaptive dp control schemes respectively where the disturbances were online estimated through the adaptive disturbance observer brodtkorb et al 2018 proposed a novel online estimate method for wave drift force where the estimates were introduced in the dp control system for feed forward compensating wave disturbance vaerno et al vaernø et al 2017 employed the model based observer to estimate the slow varying disturbances for dp of vessels where the performance of the observer was verified in both a high fidelity simulation model and the research vessel gunnerus in vaernø et al 2019a different bias load models for dp were presented and several common observer algorithms for dp were compared in vaernø et al 2019b four methods for compensating the bias load for dp were presented and compared in zhao et al 2019 a robust adaptive terminal sliding mode dp control scheme was developed for a semi submersible offshore platform where an adaptive compensator was proposed to reject the effects of the disturbances in practice however because of ship thruster system physical limitations there exist the magnitude and rate constraints of command control inputs considering unknown constant disturbances and input magnitude constraint perez and donaire 2009 proposed the anti windup control strategies introducing the integral action in the control design respectively under the consideration of input magnitude constraints and unknown time varying disturbances chang et al 2010 presented a fuzzy controller for the dp of ships subject to multiplicative noises with inputs constraints based on parallel distributed compensation takagi sugeno fuzzy model and linear matrix inequality du et al 2016 designed a dp robust control scheme combining the auxiliary dynamic system and the disturbance observer with the dynamic surface control dsc method zheng et al 2017 proposed a trajectory tracking control scheme for ships with unknown time varying disturbances and asymmetric input constraints lin et al 2018 proposed a fault tolerant output feedback control law for ship dp systems subject to thruster faults unknown time varying disturbances and dynamic uncertainties under inputs constraints sarhadi et al 2016 developed a model reference adaptive proportional integral derivative control with anti windup compensator for underwater vehicles with model uncertainty and actuator saturation the references perez and donaire 2009 donaire and perez 2012 chang et al 2010 du et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 lin et al 2018 sarhadi et al 2016 ignore the input rate constraint considering input magnitude and rate constraints under unknown constant disturbances veksler et al 2016 developed a model predictive control mpc scheme for dp of ships where input magnitude and rate constraints were dealt with using mpc based on constrained optimization considering input magnitude and rate constraints under unknown time varying disturbances hu et al 2018 developed a robust adaptive control law for dp of ships where an auxiliary dynamic system was constructed to handle the input magnitude and rate constraints on the other hand it is necessary to consider the prescribed control performance in the dp control design the reference bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 firstly developed the prescribed performance control method by constructing a logarithmic error mapping function which has widely been used in the prescribed performance control of nonlinear systems wang et al 2018 li and tong 2018 and manipulator systems lu and jia 2019 zhu et al 2019 furthermore based on the constructed non logarithmic piecewise error mapping functions the references han and lee 2014 wang and yang 2018 designed the prescribed performance control laws for a class of strict feedback nonlinear system and a class of mimo nonlinear system respectively so far as is known to the authors no results have been reported on the dp of ships with the prescribed performance in the simultaneous presence of unknown time varying disturbances and input magnitude and rate constraints this work is thus motivated to propose a dp robust adaptive prescribed performance control rappc scheme the main contributions of this paper are as follows simultaneously considering unknown time varying disturbances and input magnitude and rate constraints this paper for the first time develops the robust adaptive control law with prescribed performance for dp of ships by means of a simple non logarithmic error mapping function such that the ship works in a tolerant and safe working area with the desired positioning accuracy the remaining of this paper is organized as follows the problem formulation is presented in section 2 the dp rappc design is detailed in section 3 section 4 provides the simulations on a supply ship finally section 5 concludes this work 2 problem formulation let η x y ψ t comprising of ship position x y and heading ψ in the north east frame and ν u v r t comprising of ship velocities u in surge v in sway and r in yaw in the body fixed frame respectively the motion mathematical model of a ship in the dp mode is expressed as follows fossen and strand 1999 1 η j ψ ν 2 m ν d ν τ d t where j ψ r 3 3 denotes the rotation with j ψ 1 and j t ψ j 1 ψ here represents the 2 norm of a matrix or a vector m r 3 3 is the inertia matrix with the added mass d r 3 3 is the linear damping matrix they are respectively 3 j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 4 m m x u 0 0 0 m y v m x g y r 0 m x g n v i z n r 5 d x u 0 0 0 y v y r 0 n v n r where m is the mass of the ship x g denotes the longitudinal position of the center of gravity of the ship relative to the body fixed frame i z is the moment of inertia in yaw x u y v y r n v and n r represent hydrodynamic added mass x u y v y r n v and n r are the linear damping coefficients according to the assumption 1 in fossen and strand 1999 m is positive definite and symmetric d t d 1 t d 2 t d 3 t t represents the low frequency lf disturbance vector comprising of equivalent disturbance forces d 1 in surge d 2 in sway and moment d 3 in yaw in the body fixed frame respectively τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t denotes the actual control vector consisting of equivalent surge force τ 1 sway force τ 2 and yaw moment τ 3 provided by the thruster system in practice the magnitude and rate of the actual control vector τ are bounded i e 6 τ i τ m i τ i τ r i i 1 2 3 with τ m i 0 representing input magnitude limit and τ r i 0 representing input rate limit here we notate τ c τ c 1 τ c 2 τ c 3 t as the command control vector calculated by the dp control law to be designed later notate δ τ τ τ c as the inconsistency between the actual and the command control vectors induced by the input magnitude and rate limitations then the ship s kinetic model 2 is rewritten as follows 7 m ν d ν τ c δ τ d t remark 1 there inevitably exist the inconsistency δ τ between the command and the actual control signals because of the magnitude and rate constraints of the control inputs an auxiliary dynamic system will be proposed to mitigate the effects of the inconsistency δ τ due to the magnitude and rate constraints in the later control design remark 2 the ocean disturbances acting on the ship are usually divided into two types the lf disturbances caused by second order waves current and wind and the wave frequency wf disturbances caused by first order waves the lf and wf disturbances induce the ship s drift motions and the ship s oscillatory motions respectively the wf disturbances are unnecessary to be compensated for because they rock the ship back and forth compensating for first order wave induced oscillatory motions would give rise to the tear and wear of actuators and increase the fuel consumption veksler et al 2016 the oscillatory motions should be filtered out from the ship s position and heading measurements through wave filtering techniques fossen and strand 1999 hassani et al 2012 fossen 2011 fossen and perez 2009 therefore we only need to consider the lf disturbances when performing dp control design assumption 1 the lf disturbances d i t i 1 2 3 are unknown time varying and bounded as well as are able to be expressed as the superposition of a series of sinusoidal components 8 d i t j 1 q a i j sin ω i j t ε i j where q is a natural number a i j ω i j and ε i j represent unknown amplitude frequency and phase respectively remark 3 the ocean environment is changing and unpredictable in addition according to the fourier analysis the lf disturbances can be decomposed into a series of sinusoidal components with different amplitudes phases and frequencies faltinsen 2005 assumption 1 is thus reasonable the ship s position x y and heading ψ should be maintained at the desired value η d x d y d ψ d t with the prescribed performance of the positioning error e η η d e x e y e ψ t which means the positioning error should satisfy 9 e κ t e κ t e κ t t 0 κ x y ψ with 10 e κ t e κ 0 e κ exp μ κ t e κ 11 e κ t e κ 0 e κ exp μ κ t e κ where e κ t and e κ t are the prescribed performance of the positioning error e κ 0 e κ e κ 0 e κ and μ j are positive constants and e κ e κ 0 and e κ e κ 0 the pictorial illustration of the prescribed performance is illustrated in fig 1 if the positioning error satisfies 7 the dynamically positioning ship will be kept in the tolerantly safe area in this paper the control objective is to develop a rappc law τ c for the dp of the ship with the lf disturbances under assumption 1 and the input magnitude and rate constraints 6 so that the position x y and heading ψ of the ship are kept at the desired value η d x d y d ψ d t with the positioning error e κ settling within the prescribed boundaries e κ t and e κ t while guaranteeing the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the dp closed loop control system 3 dp robust adaptive prescribed performance control design in this section the dp rappc law for a ship under unknown time varying disturbances with input magnitude and rate constraints will be developed a simple error mapping function is constructed to ensure the positioning error meeting the requirements 9 an adaptive disturbance observer is employed online estimate the unknown time varying disturbances an auxiliary dynamic system with the inconsistency δ τ between the command and actual control signals being input is employed to address the effects of input magnitude and rate constraints polycarpou and farrell 2004 farrell et al 2004 based on the above the dp rappc law is proposed applying the dsc method swaroop et al 2000 wang and huang 2005 the schematic of the dp closed loop control system of the ship is illustrated in fig 2 3 1 control design first we construct the following error mapping function 12 s 1 κ f e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ where s 1 κ is the transformed new error variable it is seen from 12 that s 1 κ 0 if and only if e κ 0 and s 1 κ tends to infinity when the positioning error e κ tends to its prescribed boundary e κ or e κ on the other hand f in 17 is strictly increasing therefore under the condition e κ 0 e κ 0 e κ 0 the boundedness of s 1 κ is sufficient to make sure that the positioning error e κ meets the requirements of 9 based on the error mapping function 12 we design the dp rappc law for ships step 1 taking the time derivative of s 1 κ according to 12 we have 13 s 1 κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ 2 e κ e κ 2 n i e κ q κ where n κ e κ 2 e κ e κ e κ e κ 2 e κ e κ 2 0 and q κ e i 2 e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ 2 e κ e κ 2 according to 1 and 13 we have 14 s 1 n j ψ ν q where n n x n y n ψ t q q x q y q ψ t and ν is viewed as the virtual control vector design the virtual stabilizing function vector α 1 r 3 for ν as follows 15 α 1 j t ψ n 1 k 1 s 1 q n s 1 where k 1 is the 3 3 positive definite symmetric design matrix let α 1 pass through the first order filter 16 π d β d β d α 1 β d 0 α 1 0 where β d r 3 is the state vector and π d 0 is the design constant remark 4 it is noted from 16 that the differential term β d can be obtained directly by β d α 1 β d π d which can be used to replace the differential term α 1 required in the vectorial backstepping design so that the differential operation is replaced by the simple algebraic operation as a result the dp robust adaptive control law will be efficient to compute and easy to implement in practice step 2 define the velocity error surface vector 17 s 2 ν β d taking the time derivative of 17 along 7 we have 18 s 2 m 1 d ν τ d m β d m 1 d ν τ c δ τ d m β d according to theorem 2 in hu et al 2017 the unknown lf disturbance d of the ship can be represented as the linear parametric form 19 d θ t ς ˆ θ t ς where θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 r 6 q 3 is the unknown coefficient matrix with θ i θ 1 i θ 6 q i t r 6 q i 1 2 3 being the i th column vector and ς ˆ r 6 q is the estimate vector generated by the following observer 20 ς ˆ ρ f ν 21 ρ g ρ g f f m 1 d ν f m 1 τ with ρ r 6 q being the auxiliary vector g r 6 q 6 q being a hurwitz design matrix l r 6 q 3 being a design matrix and f r 6 q 3 being a design matrix satisfying 22 f m 1 l the estimation error ς ς ς ˆ obeys 23 ς g ς according to 18 and 19 we obtain 24 s 2 m 1 d ν τ c δ τ θ t ς ˆ θ t ς m β d to mitigate the effects of δ τ on the dp control performance we construct the following auxiliary dynamic system 25 m ξ k 2 ξ δ τ here ξ r 3 is the state vector of the auxiliary dynamic system which is a filtered version of the effect of input magnitude and rate constraints on the variable being controlled and is involved in the dp control design to be presented later and k 2 is a 3 3 positive definite symmetric design matrix furthermore we define an auxiliary error vector 26 s 2 s 2 ξ design the following dp rappc law 27 τ c j t ψ n s 1 k 2 s 2 d ν m β d k 2 ξ θ ˆ t ς ˆ with the adaptive law incorporating a leakage term to reduce the effects of parameter drifting 28 θ ˆ i γ i s 2 i ς ˆ σ i θ ˆ i i 1 2 3 where θ ˆ θ ˆ 1 θ ˆ 2 θ ˆ 3 r 6 q 3 is the estimate of θ with θ ˆ i θ ˆ 1 i θ ˆ 6 q i t r 6 q i 1 2 3 being the i th column vector and γ i r 6 q 6 q i 1 2 3 is a positive definite symmetric design matrix remark 5 the observer 20 21 together with the adaptive law 28 provides the online estimate vector θ ˆ t ς ˆ for unknown time varying disturbance vector d which can be viewed as the adaptive disturbance observer as a result the robust dp of ships is conveniently realized through adaptive control algorithms on the other hand in this paper the adaptive disturbance observer provides the estimates of unknown time varying disturbances rather than the estimates of their constant upper bounds by contrast our proposed control method has less conservativeness 3 2 stability analysis the main results of the paper are summarized in the following theorem theorem 1 consider the ship outlined in 1 and 7 with the lf disturbances and the input magnitude and rate of change constraints 6 and apply the dp rappc law 27 28 with the virtual stabilizing function vector 15 the first order filter 16 the observer 20 21 and the auxiliary dynamic system 25 if assumption 1 holds for all v 0 b 0 with b 0 being any positive constant we have the following results 1 the error vector s 1 η η d settles within s 1 r 3 s 1 ζ s 1 ζ s 1 c μ which can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately choosing the design constants σ i i 1 2 3 π d and the design matrices g l f γ i k 1 k 2 satisfying 22 and 43 46 as such the position x y and heading ψ of the ship are kept at the desired value η d x d y d ψ d t with the prescribed performance 2 all signals in

receptively the simulation results in case 1 are depicted in fig 3 a 3 f furthermore the performance indices of the proposed dp rappc law are listed in table 2 where the settling time t s is taken as the maximum value of the times at which the north position x east position y and heading ψ enter and remain within the specified error bands 1m 1m and 1 360 π rad respectively it is seen from fig 3 a

that the kalman filter can filter out the measurement noises and the oscillatory motions from the ship s position and heading measurements case 2 choose ψ 2 d i a g 2 10 2 2 10 2 2 10 3 m w i t h p e

disturbance is changed to two times as large as that in case 1 and the parameters of the ship motion mathematical model are perturbed the desired position and heading of the ship initial conditions and the remaining design parameters are identical to the counterparts in case 1 which means that the dp control laws in both case 1 and case 2 are the same the simulation results in case 2 are depicted in fig 4 a f and the performance indices are summarized in table 2 from fig 3 a 3 e and 4 a 4 e and table 2 it is obviously seen that the designed dp rappc law shows almost same control performance in two cases which indicates that the designed dp rappc law has good robustness to the time varying disturbances and model parameter perturbations 4 2 simulation comparisons in this

the expressions of ξ θ ˆ and ς ˆ are identical to those in 27 the design parameters of τ c o m are chosen the same to those of our designed dp rappc the simulation results in two cases are plotted in

21855,a robust adaptive prescribed performance control rappc law is proposed for dynamic positioning dp of ships subject to unknown time varying disturbances with the control input magnitude and rate constraints a simple error mapping function is first constructed to achieve the dp prescribed performance control design next an adaptive disturbance observer is proposed to online estimate the unknown time varying disturbances and an auxiliary dynamic system is introduced to addresses the effects of the input magnitude and rate constraints then incorporating the above into the dynamic surface control method the dp control law with prescribed performance is proposed theoretical analysis and simulation results prove that the proposed dp rappc law makes the ship s position and heading be maintained at the desired values with prescribed positioning performance keywords dynamic positioning of ships input magnitude and rate constraints adaptive disturbance observer auxiliary dynamic system prescribed performance 1 introduction a dynamic positioning dp system allows an autonomous floating structure such as a platform or a ship to automatically keep its position and heading at the desired values by using its own thrusters propellers and rudders sørensen 2011 shi et al 2017 with the ocean exploitation and exploration further developing to the distant and deep ocean the dp systems are widely used in the field of ocean engineering as pipe laying drilling hydrographic surveying and ocean observation hassani et al 2013 fossen 1994 li et al 2018 however ships inevitably suffer from changeable and unpredictable ocean environmental disturbances furthermore the magnitude and the rate of change of the command control forces and moment are constrained because of the physical limitations of a ship s propulsion system hence dp control design should take into account the effects of the disturbances and constraints to ensure high dp performance in the presence of unknown constant disturbances the dp adaptive robust output feedback control scheme was developed incorporating an adaptive state observer into the vectorial backstepping method in do 2011 to deal with wave and low frequency disturbances a passive observer was constructed to online estimate the ship s low frequency position velocities and slow varying disturbances in fossen and strand 1999 using this passive observer a dp robust control scheme was proposed in loria et al 2000 nevertheless the passive observer in fossen and strand 1999 loria et al 2000 requires disturbances priori knowledge for ships operating in unpredictable and varying sea states a dp hybrid control strategy based on supervisory switching logic was developed in nguyen et al 2007 where different control laws and wave filters can be switched automatically in terms of different sea states under the conditions of model parameter perturbations as well as time varying disturbances a dp sliding mode control scheme was developed for a turret moored floating production storage and offloading system in tannuri et al 2001 a dp robust h control scheme was designed in katebi et al 2001 and a dp robust control scheme using h and mixed μ methods was given in hassani et al 2017 respectively in the presence of unknown time varying disturbances many researchers proposed different dp schemes hu et al 2015 2017 du et al 2018 brodtkorb et al 2018 vaernø et al 2017 2019a 2019b zhao et al 2019 hu et al 2015 proposed an adaptive fuzzy dp control scheme where the uncertainties arising from unknown time varying disturbances were approximated by adaptive fuzzy system hu et al 2017 and du et al 2018 proposed the robust adaptive dp control schemes respectively where the disturbances were online estimated through the adaptive disturbance observer brodtkorb et al 2018 proposed a novel online estimate method for wave drift force where the estimates were introduced in the dp control system for feed forward compensating wave disturbance vaerno et al vaernø et al 2017 employed the model based observer to estimate the slow varying disturbances for dp of vessels where the performance of the observer was verified in both a high fidelity simulation model and the research vessel gunnerus in vaernø et al 2019a different bias load models for dp were presented and several common observer algorithms for dp were compared in vaernø et al 2019b four methods for compensating the bias load for dp were presented and compared in zhao et al 2019 a robust adaptive terminal sliding mode dp control scheme was developed for a semi submersible offshore platform where an adaptive compensator was proposed to reject the effects of the disturbances in practice however because of ship thruster system physical limitations there exist the magnitude and rate constraints of command control inputs considering unknown constant disturbances and input magnitude constraint perez and donaire 2009 proposed the anti windup control strategies introducing the integral action in the control design respectively under the consideration of input magnitude constraints and unknown time varying disturbances chang et al 2010 presented a fuzzy controller for the dp of ships subject to multiplicative noises with inputs constraints based on parallel distributed compensation takagi sugeno fuzzy model and linear matrix inequality du et al 2016 designed a dp robust control scheme combining the auxiliary dynamic system and the disturbance observer with the dynamic surface control dsc method zheng et al 2017 proposed a trajectory tracking control scheme for ships with unknown time varying disturbances and asymmetric input constraints lin et al 2018 proposed a fault tolerant output feedback control law for ship dp systems subject to thruster faults unknown time varying disturbances and dynamic uncertainties under inputs constraints sarhadi et al 2016 developed a model reference adaptive proportional integral derivative control with anti windup compensator for underwater vehicles with model uncertainty and actuator saturation the references perez and donaire 2009 donaire and perez 2012 chang et al 2010 du et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 lin et al 2018 sarhadi et al 2016 ignore the input rate constraint considering input magnitude and rate constraints under unknown constant disturbances veksler et al 2016 developed a model predictive control mpc scheme for dp of ships where input magnitude and rate constraints were dealt with using mpc based on constrained optimization considering input magnitude and rate constraints under unknown time varying disturbances hu et al 2018 developed a robust adaptive control law for dp of ships where an auxiliary dynamic system was constructed to handle the input magnitude and rate constraints on the other hand it is necessary to consider the prescribed control performance in the dp control design the reference bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 firstly developed the prescribed performance control method by constructing a logarithmic error mapping function which has widely been used in the prescribed performance control of nonlinear systems wang et al 2018 li and tong 2018 and manipulator systems lu and jia 2019 zhu et al 2019 furthermore based on the constructed non logarithmic piecewise error mapping functions the references han and lee 2014 wang and yang 2018 designed the prescribed performance control laws for a class of strict feedback nonlinear system and a class of mimo nonlinear system respectively so far as is known to the authors no results have been reported on the dp of ships with the prescribed performance in the simultaneous presence of unknown time varying disturbances and input magnitude and rate constraints this work is thus motivated to propose a dp robust adaptive prescribed performance control rappc scheme the main contributions of this paper are as follows simultaneously considering unknown time varying disturbances and input magnitude and rate constraints this paper for the first time develops the robust adaptive control law with prescribed performance for dp of ships by means of a simple non logarithmic error mapping function such that the ship works in a tolerant and safe working area with the desired positioning accuracy the remaining of this paper is organized as follows the problem formulation is presented in section 2 the dp rappc design is detailed in section 3 section 4 provides the simulations on a supply ship finally section 5 concludes this work 2 problem formulation let η x y ψ t comprising of ship position x y and heading ψ in the north east frame and ν u v r t comprising of ship velocities u in surge v in sway and r in yaw in the body fixed frame respectively the motion mathematical model of a ship in the dp mode is expressed as follows fossen and strand 1999 1 η j ψ ν 2 m ν d ν τ d t where j ψ r 3 3 denotes the rotation with j ψ 1 and j t ψ j 1 ψ here represents the 2 norm of a matrix or a vector m r 3 3 is the inertia matrix with the added mass d r 3 3 is the linear damping matrix they are respectively 3 j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 4 m m x u 0 0 0 m y v m x g y r 0 m x g n v i z n r 5 d x u 0 0 0 y v y r 0 n v n r where m is the mass of the ship x g denotes the longitudinal position of the center of gravity of the ship relative to the body fixed frame i z is the moment of inertia in yaw x u y v y r n v and n r represent hydrodynamic added mass x u y v y r n v and n r are the linear damping coefficients according to the assumption 1 in fossen and strand 1999 m is positive definite and symmetric d t d 1 t d 2 t d 3 t t represents the low frequency lf disturbance vector comprising of equivalent disturbance forces d 1 in surge d 2 in sway and moment d 3 in yaw in the body fixed frame respectively τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t denotes the actual control vector consisting of equivalent surge force τ 1 sway force τ 2 and yaw moment τ 3 provided by the thruster system in practice the magnitude and rate of the actual control vector τ are bounded i e 6 τ i τ m i τ i τ r i i 1 2 3 with τ m i 0 representing input magnitude limit and τ r i 0 representing input rate limit here we notate τ c τ c 1 τ c 2 τ c 3 t as the command control vector calculated by the dp control law to be designed later notate δ τ τ τ c as the inconsistency between the actual and the command control vectors induced by the input magnitude and rate limitations then the ship s kinetic model 2 is rewritten as follows 7 m ν d ν τ c δ τ d t remark 1 there inevitably exist the inconsistency δ τ between the command and the actual control signals because of the magnitude and rate constraints of the control inputs an auxiliary dynamic system will be proposed to mitigate the effects of the inconsistency δ τ due to the magnitude and rate constraints in the later control design remark 2 the ocean disturbances acting on the ship are usually divided into two types the lf disturbances caused by second order waves current and wind and the wave frequency wf disturbances caused by first order waves the lf and wf disturbances induce the ship s drift motions and the ship s oscillatory motions respectively the wf disturbances are unnecessary to be compensated for because they rock the ship back and forth compensating for first order wave induced oscillatory motions would give rise to the tear and wear of actuators and increase the fuel consumption veksler et al 2016 the oscillatory motions should be filtered out from the ship s position and heading measurements through wave filtering techniques fossen and strand 1999 hassani et al 2012 fossen 2011 fossen and perez 2009 therefore we only need to consider the lf disturbances when performing dp control design assumption 1 the lf disturbances d i t i 1 2 3 are unknown time varying and bounded as well as are able to be expressed as the superposition of a series of sinusoidal components 8 d i t j 1 q a i j sin ω i j t ε i j where q is a natural number a i j ω i j and ε i j represent unknown amplitude frequency and phase respectively remark 3 the ocean environment is changing and unpredictable in addition according to the fourier analysis the lf disturbances can be decomposed into a series of sinusoidal components with different amplitudes phases and frequencies faltinsen 2005 assumption 1 is thus reasonable the ship s position x y and heading ψ should be maintained at the desired value η d x d y d ψ d t with the prescribed performance of the positioning error e η η d e x e y e ψ t which means the positioning error should satisfy 9 e κ t e κ t e κ t t 0 κ x y ψ with 10 e κ t e κ 0 e κ exp μ κ t e κ 11 e κ t e κ 0 e κ exp μ κ t e κ where e κ t and e κ t are the prescribed performance of the positioning error e κ 0 e κ e κ 0 e κ and μ j are positive constants and e κ e κ 0 and e κ e κ 0 the pictorial illustration of the prescribed performance is illustrated in fig 1 if the positioning error satisfies 7 the dynamically positioning ship will be kept in the tolerantly safe area in this paper the control objective is to develop a rappc law τ c for the dp of the ship with the lf disturbances under assumption 1 and the input magnitude and rate constraints 6 so that the position x y and heading ψ of the ship are kept at the desired value η d x d y d ψ d t with the positioning error e κ settling within the prescribed boundaries e κ t and e κ t while guaranteeing the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the dp closed loop control system 3 dp robust adaptive prescribed performance control design in this section the dp rappc law for a ship under unknown time varying disturbances with input magnitude and rate constraints will be developed a simple error mapping function is constructed to ensure the positioning error meeting the requirements 9 an adaptive disturbance observer is employed online estimate the unknown time varying disturbances an auxiliary dynamic system with the inconsistency δ τ between the command and actual control signals being input is employed to address the effects of input magnitude and rate constraints polycarpou and farrell 2004 farrell et al 2004 based on the above the dp rappc law is proposed applying the dsc method swaroop et al 2000 wang and huang 2005 the schematic of the dp closed loop control system of the ship is illustrated in fig 2 3 1 control design first we construct the following error mapping function 12 s 1 κ f e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ where s 1 κ is the transformed new error variable it is seen from 12 that s 1 κ 0 if and only if e κ 0 and s 1 κ tends to infinity when the positioning error e κ tends to its prescribed boundary e κ or e κ on the other hand f in 17 is strictly increasing therefore under the condition e κ 0 e κ 0 e κ 0 the boundedness of s 1 κ is sufficient to make sure that the positioning error e κ meets the requirements of 9 based on the error mapping function 12 we design the dp rappc law for ships step 1 taking the time derivative of s 1 κ according to 12 we have 13 s 1 κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ 2 e κ e κ 2 n i e κ q κ where n κ e κ 2 e κ e κ e κ e κ 2 e κ e κ 2 0 and q κ e i 2 e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ e κ 2 e κ e κ 2 according to 1 and 13 we have 14 s 1 n j ψ ν q where n n x n y n ψ t q q x q y q ψ t and ν is viewed as the virtual control vector design the virtual stabilizing function vector α 1 r 3 for ν as follows 15 α 1 j t ψ n 1 k 1 s 1 q n s 1 where k 1 is the 3 3 positive definite symmetric design matrix let α 1 pass through the first order filter 16 π d β d β d α 1 β d 0 α 1 0 where β d r 3 is the state vector and π d 0 is the design constant remark 4 it is noted from 16 that the differential term β d can be obtained directly by β d α 1 β d π d which can be used to replace the differential term α 1 required in the vectorial backstepping design so that the differential operation is replaced by the simple algebraic operation as a result the dp robust adaptive control law will be efficient to compute and easy to implement in practice step 2 define the velocity error surface vector 17 s 2 ν β d taking the time derivative of 17 along 7 we have 18 s 2 m 1 d ν τ d m β d m 1 d ν τ c δ τ d m β d according to theorem 2 in hu et al 2017 the unknown lf disturbance d of the ship can be represented as the linear parametric form 19 d θ t ς ˆ θ t ς where θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 r 6 q 3 is the unknown coefficient matrix with θ i θ 1 i θ 6 q i t r 6 q i 1 2 3 being the i th column vector and ς ˆ r 6 q is the estimate vector generated by the following observer 20 ς ˆ ρ f ν 21 ρ g ρ g f f m 1 d ν f m 1 τ with ρ r 6 q being the auxiliary vector g r 6 q 6 q being a hurwitz design matrix l r 6 q 3 being a design matrix and f r 6 q 3 being a design matrix satisfying 22 f m 1 l the estimation error ς ς ς ˆ obeys 23 ς g ς according to 18 and 19 we obtain 24 s 2 m 1 d ν τ c δ τ θ t ς ˆ θ t ς m β d to mitigate the effects of δ τ on the dp control performance we construct the following auxiliary dynamic system 25 m ξ k 2 ξ δ τ here ξ r 3 is the state vector of the auxiliary dynamic system which is a filtered version of the effect of input magnitude and rate constraints on the variable being controlled and is involved in the dp control design to be presented later and k 2 is a 3 3 positive definite symmetric design matrix furthermore we define an auxiliary error vector 26 s 2 s 2 ξ design the following dp rappc law 27 τ c j t ψ n s 1 k 2 s 2 d ν m β d k 2 ξ θ ˆ t ς ˆ with the adaptive law incorporating a leakage term to reduce the effects of parameter drifting 28 θ ˆ i γ i s 2 i ς ˆ σ i θ ˆ i i 1 2 3 where θ ˆ θ ˆ 1 θ ˆ 2 θ ˆ 3 r 6 q 3 is the estimate of θ with θ ˆ i θ ˆ 1 i θ ˆ 6 q i t r 6 q i 1 2 3 being the i th column vector and γ i r 6 q 6 q i 1 2 3 is a positive definite symmetric design matrix remark 5 the observer 20 21 together with the adaptive law 28 provides the online estimate vector θ ˆ t ς ˆ for unknown time varying disturbance vector d which can be viewed as the adaptive disturbance observer as a result the robust dp of ships is conveniently realized through adaptive control algorithms on the other hand in this paper the adaptive disturbance observer provides the estimates of unknown time varying disturbances rather than the estimates of their constant upper bounds by contrast our proposed control method has less conservativeness 3 2 stability analysis the main results of the paper are summarized in the following theorem theorem 1 consider the ship outlined in 1 and 7 with the lf disturbances and the input magnitude and rate of change constraints 6 and apply the dp rappc law 27 28 with the virtual stabilizing function vector 15 the first order filter 16 the observer 20 21 and the auxiliary dynamic system 25 if assumption 1 holds for all v 0 b 0 with b 0 being any positive constant we have the following results 1 the error vector s 1 η η d settles within s 1 r 3 s 1 ζ s 1 ζ s 1 c μ which can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately choosing the design constants σ i i 1 2 3 π d and the design matrices g l f γ i k 1 k 2 satisfying 22 and 43 46 as such the position x y and heading ψ of the ship are kept at the desired value η d x d y d ψ d t with the prescribed performance 2 all signals in

receptively the simulation results in case 1 are depicted in fig 3 a 3 f furthermore the performance indices of the proposed dp rappc law are listed in table 2 where the settling time t s is taken as the maximum value of the times at which the north position x east position y and heading ψ enter and remain within the specified error bands 1m 1m and 1 360 π rad respectively it is seen from fig 3 a

that the kalman filter can filter out the measurement noises and the oscillatory motions from the ship s position and heading measurements case 2 choose ψ 2 d i a g 2 10 2 2 10 2 2 10 3 m w i t h p e

disturbance is changed to two times as large as that in case 1 and the parameters of the ship motion mathematical model are perturbed the desired position and heading of the ship initial conditions and the remaining design parameters are identical to the counterparts in case 1 which means that the dp control laws in both case 1 and case 2 are the same the simulation results in case 2 are depicted in fig 4 a f and the performance indices are summarized in table 2 from fig 3 a 3 e and 4 a 4 e and table 2 it is obviously seen that the designed dp rappc law shows almost same control performance in two cases which indicates that the designed dp rappc law has good robustness to the time varying disturbances and model parameter perturbations 4 2 simulation comparisons in this

21856,a new type of bow appendage is proposed to reduce resistance of high speed ship with a froude number of 0 4 0 5 in this paper the ship bow appendage can restrain the bow waves of high speed ships thus enabling to decrease the principal wave making resistance significantly in this study resistance experiments and numerical simulation calculations on a ship model were carried out this new type of bow appendage was designed according to wave pattern of the ship model at the froude number of 0 45 aiming to restrain the peak of bow wave numerical calculation shows that the bow appendage can affect the wave making state and reduce the resistance of ship model at high speed and the effect of the bow appendage is sensitive to its installation position and the model speed the ship model experiments were conducted to verify the effects of the bow appendage on reducing the resistance of ship model experiment results show that this bow appendage is able to restrain bow wave of the ship model and reduce the total resistance by more than 8 to the maximum extent the water spray induced by the bow appendage can be improved by optimization of the shape keywords bow appendage resistance reduction wave making resistance high speed ship 1 introduction reducing the resistance of ship is conducive to increasing the speed of ship and reducing energy consumption resistance of ships mainly includes frictional resistance viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance for low speed ships the frictional resistance accounts for the largest proportion of total resistance friction resistance can be reduced by using antifouling coatings yigit kemal demirel et al 2014 micro grooved surfaces liu et al 2007 and lubrication air layers jamie butterworth et al 2015 the wave making resistance originates from disturbances of ship to the water and air interface which increases dramatically with the increase of navigation speed of ships for high speed displacement ships the proportion of wave making resistance in total resistance is higher than 50 therefore reducing wave making resistance is vital to lower the ships resistance major techniques to reduce ships wave making resistance are introduced as follows hull form optimization technique based on numerical calculation and optimization algorithm of wave making resistance this technique is used to design a hull form with the minimum wave making resistance by combining certain constraints siung 1981 bao et al 2015 calculated the ship wave making resistance by rankine source method through which they concluded the minimum resistance hull form kostas et al 2015 studied the ship hull optimization method using t spline based on boundary element method wavelet method was put forward by zhao et al 2015 to optimize ship wave resistance andrea et al 2016 optimized hydrodynamics of ships by local hybridization of deterministic derivative free global algorithms with the progresses on multidisciplinary optimization algorithms hull form optimization has been developed from the simple optimization of wave making resistance to optimization of comprehensive navigation performances the hull form optimization technique has some shortcomings firstly the hull form with the minimum wave making resistance might be related to the speed range secondly one hull form is difficult to achieve low wave making resistance in the whole range of navigation speed kim et al 2008 feng et al 2018 thirdly almost the hull forms are restricted by floating ability stability arrangement and loading resulting in the limited space for hull form optimization bulbous bow technique this technique designs the front part of a ship below the water surface into a spherical bow the bulbous bow also induces wave making however this wave is opposite to the first transverse wave of the original hull s bow wave system as a result the total wave resistance of ships can be reduced wang and lu 2006 jin and young 2017 according to theoretical and experimental studies bulbous bow technique can effectively reduce wave making resistance for the low speed or moderate speed ships when froude number is smaller than 0 35 but it is difficult to reduce the resistance of high speed ships significantly with froude number over 0 4 anti wave hydrofoil technique this technique is to install hydrofoils at the fore of ships below the water surface lu et al 2008 pointed out that hydrofoil can reduce wave making resistance by changing wave making form of the bow during high navigation speed of ships anti wave hydrofoil technique also has a disadvantage according to model test and numerical calculations reducing resistance of anti wave hydrofoil can only be realized through extremely high speed navigation when froude number is higher than 0 5 however such navigation speed is beyond the ability of most displacement ships all over the world yet since the navigation state of high speed ships changes greatly a stern plate resistance reduction technology that can decrease trim of hull and increase virtual stern length has been developed zheng et al 2011 this technology can reduce the resistance under the appropriate working conditions bulbous bow and anti wave hydrofoil can reduce wave making resistance by producing opposite phase waves to the original bow wave induced by ship hull but they fail to decrease resistance of high speed ships with froude number ranging between 0 4 and 0 5 to address these problems a new type of bow appendage technology was proposed or designed it can directly restrain wave peak of bow change the distribution of the pressure field on the ship hull and finally reduce wave making resistance and total resistance of high speed ships 2 resistance experiment and numerical calculation of a high speed ship model generally speaking hydrodynamic resistance takes the dominant role in total resistance of bare hull hydrodynamic resistance of bare hull can be divided into frictional resistance viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance their proportions in total resistance are closely related with hull form and navigation speed of ships for conventional high speed displacement mono hull ships the length breadth ratio is generally higher than 7 while the block coefficient is generally lower than 0 55 conventional high speed displacement mono hull ships generally have a slim hull which has a square stern the viscous pressure resistance accounts for a small proportion of the total resistance however the proportion of wave making resistance increases quickly with the increase of navigation speed in this study a resistance experiment and a numerical calculation of wave making flow field were carried out based on a ship model with the scale ratio of 1 20 the geometry of the ship model is shown in fig 1 main parameters are listed in table 1 in this experiment resistance components of ships and wave pattern produced by the bow were analyzed this is because weight and center of gravity cg position of the ship model need to be adjusted by placing and moving weights inside the ship before the experiment the hull cannot be closed by the deck moreover the freeboard height of ship model was increased to 0 35m in the experiment 2 1 resistance experiments of the ship model a resistance experiment of the ship model was conducted in a towing tank with 320m in length 10m in width and 5m in depth the ship model was towed by the carriage in the tank the towing speed of the carriage could reach 7 m s and the speed precision was controlled at 0 1 in order to analyze the test error the resistance experiments of the ship model under every towing speed has been performed three times test results are shown in table 2 where v m is speed of the ship model and fr is froude number that uses waterline length of the ship model as the reference length froude number is defined as follows 1 f r v m g l w l note that the stern trim is negative in table 2 the errors of the test resistance results are analyzed and shown in table 3 here the error is the maximum of the three test values minus the minimum and then divided by the average it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that test values of resistance sinkage and trim of the ship model under different towing speeds are very similar in three tests which proves the high stability and accuracy of the testing system especially when the ship model speed exceeds 2 685 m s the relative errors of the resistance test results are less than 1 because the absolute value of the trim is very small its relative test error is slightly larger wave patterns produced by bow of the ship model under four froude numbers are shown in fig 2 a significant positive relation between the height of the wave peak of bow and the towing speed was observed the total resistance coefficient of the ship model c t which is calculated by the averaged experiment results and the frictional resistance coefficients c f which is calculated from the formula ittc 57 are listed in table 4 re is the reynolds number which uses waterline length of the ship model as the reference length c r represents residual resistance coefficient of the ship model the relationship of these three resistance coefficients is as follows 2 c t r t 0 5 ρ v m 2 s 3 c r c t c f where r t is total resistance of the ship model and s is wetted area of the ship model obviously the proportion of residual resistance coefficient in total resistance coefficient is higher than 60 when the froude number exceeds 0 4 although residual resistance includes wave making resistance and viscous pressure resistance the proportion of viscous pressure resistance of high speed ships with slim hulls is generally about 10 hence wave making resistance is the main component of resistance of high speed ships which have a froude number higher than 0 41 key attentions should be paid to decrease wave making resistance of high speed ships 2 2 numerical simulation of the ship model at present it is an important way to calculate the ship hydrodynamics and flow field by the method of computational fluid dynamics cfd hafizul and carlos 2019b predicted resistance of container ship by cfd and discussed effects of trim on the ship resistance under different speeds and drafts pablo et al 2016 studied the zigzag maneuver of kcs container ship in shallow water by cfd and found high consistence between cfd predictions and experimental results of most variables yavuz and baris 2017 calculated ship motions and resistance of kvlcc2 model at a constant forward velocity they demonstrated that ship resistance pitch and heave motions in regular head waves could be estimated accurately the accuracy of cfd calculation in flow field and hydrodynamic force of ships under constant speed straight movement have been verified hafizul and carlos 2019a in this study resistance of the ship model as well as sinkage and trim of the hull under different navigation speeds was calculated using cfd cfd method gets a numerical solution to flow field from the generalized fluid continuity equation and momentum equations a time average navier stokes equation and turbulence model were applied to solve complexity of turbulence the time average continuity equation of fluid as well as the time average navier stokes equations is 4 ρ u i x i 0 5 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 μ u l x l δ i j x j ρ u i u j ρ f i where ρ is the density u i denotes the averaged cartesian components of the velocity vector p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity and f i denotes the body forces the reynolds stresses ρ u i u j needs to be calculated to solve unclosed equations therefore it is necessary to introduce in a turbulence model the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model is integrated effectively with the k ε model in the far field and with the k ω model near the wall in high accuracy calculation of ship hydrodynamics hence sst k ω turbulence model was applied in the present study details of the sst k ω turbulence model had been introduced by andrea et al 2018 the sinkage and trim might be produced when froude number is higher than 0 4 these sinkage and trim behaviors cannot be ignored due to hydrodynamic forces therefore motion of the hull must be taken into account in numerical calculation this requires six degrees of freedom dofs mode to calculate resistance and flow field of ships under constant speed straight navigation the roll yaw and sway of the hull can be restricted in this way only three dofs have to be chosen and calculated in the mode in this study ship motion and resistance are simulated in fine marine with the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse and coupling six degree of freedom equations the embedded vof method can accurately capture the complex wave pattern the establishment of computational domain and grids is the basis for calculating ship model resistance using cfd method the computational domain and boundary conditions for the resistance calculation of ship model are shown in fig 3 since the hull is symmetrical it is only necessary to calculate the flow field of the half hull as shown in fig 3 the boundary condition of inlet is set as velocity inlet and the inflow velocity component is defined according to the ship model velocity the boundary condition of outlet is set as pressure outlet and the inflow pressure is defined as undisturbed pressure the boundary conditions of top bottom and side are set as far field conditions the boundary condition of hull is set as no slip wall condition the verification of the ship model resistance calculation by cfd is carried out according to the recommended procedure of 22nd ittc verification is defined as a process for assessing simulation numerical uncertainty u sn iterative and parameter convergence studies are conducted using multiple solutions and systematic parameter refinement so three sets of computational grids are created with the grid refinement ratio r g 2 as shown in fig 4 grid 1 is the fine grid with the grid number of 4 35 millions grid 2 is the middle grid with the grid number of 1 76 millions grid 3 is the coarse grid with the grid number of 0 69 millions the meshing density of bow and stern is high and the meshing density of the midship is low moreover a block of high meshing density was set close to the bow to improve calculation resolution of the bow wave pattern the calculated resistance results of the half hull at different speeds with these grids are shown in table 5 the numerical simulation uncertainty u sn are decomposed into uncertainty of grid size u g uncertainty of time step u t uncertainty of iteration u i and uncertainty of other parameters u p the expression of u sn is written as 6 u sn u g u t u i u p because in this process of the ship model resistance numerical calculation time step depends on the speed of the ship model and the grid size the uncertainty of time step u t is included in the uncertainty of grid size u g uncertainty of iteration u i reflects the influence of the iteration number on the calculation result fig 5 shows the time history curves of the calculated resistance of half hull and it can be seen that the calculated results hardly change with the iteration number and time after the calculation converges zhang et al 2008 had proved that uncertainty of iteration u i is two orders of magnitude smaller than uncertainty of grid size u g in the process of gird meshing and numerical calculations other parameters remain unchanged thus uncertainty of other parameters u p is negligible so in this ship model resistance numerical calculation it can be considered that the simulation numerical uncertainty u sn is approximately equal to the uncertainty of grid size u g based on the recommended procedure of 22nd ittc the verification of this ship model resistance calculated by numerical simulation finished and the results are shown in table 6 in table 6 r k is the converge ratio p k is the order of accuracy c k is the correction factor u sn is the simulation numerical uncertainty because r k is less than 1 for every speed the convergence of this numerical simulation by cfd is satisfied the simulation numerical uncertainty u sn is less than 1 in order to ensure the accuracy of the calculation by cfd the fine meshing scheme is used in the numerical simulation the calculated total resistance coefficients of ship model were compared to the experimental results table 7 as shown in table 7 the calculated results are in accord with the experimental results wave patterns at bow of ship model in numerical simulation are shown in fig 6 the changes of calculated wave pattern with navigation speed conform to experiment as shown in fig 2 the wave height is positively related to the navigation speed since the wave making resistance is proportional to square of wave height it increases dramatically with the increase of navigation speed in the wave system of ships the transverse wave of bow has the highest the wave making resistance can be decreased significantly as long as the wave height at bow of the high speed ship model can be restrained 3 numerical calculation of bow appendage a new type of the bow appendage is designed in the present study to restrain the bow wave of the high speed ship model in order to reduce the wave making resistance the resistance reduction principle of bow appendage is significantly different from those of traditional bulbous bow and anti wave hydrofoil to restrain the wave produced by bow effectively the new appendage is installed at the position of bow where is close to the water surface position and size of the appendage need to be designed according to wave pattern at bow the actual design speed of the full scale vessel is 30kn and the corresponding froude number is 0 45 so the wave pattern of the ship model with high froude number of 0 45 is applied as the design point the wave pattern at the bow was gotten from numerical simulation by cfd as shown in fig 6 the bow appendage fig 7 is designed preliminarily according to this wave pattern resistance of the ship model with a bow appendage which has a froude number of 0 45 was calculated by the numerical calculation method in section 2 2 to further discussion influences of installation position of the appendage on resistance reduction the installation height was moved upward and downward by 0 03m in the initial scheme from which three appendage states fa 0 fa 1 and fa 2 were obtained fa 0 stands for the initial bow appendage scheme and it is installed at the position where the front end of the appendage is just on the still water fa 1 stands for the bow appendage scheme moved upward and fa 2 stands for the bow appendage scheme moved downward to ensure the accuracy and validity of the calculated results the same meshing scheme in section 2 2 was applied in this calculation of the ship model with bow appendage blocks of high density meshing were also set at the bow which have the same sizes and positions wave patterns under the influence of bow appendage and resistance of the ship model were calculated in the calculation the navigation speed of the ship model was set to 3 452 m s which corresponds to the design point of bow appendage with the froude number of 0 45 the numerical calculation results of the wave patterns are shown in fig 8 comparison of the wave patterns fa 0 fa 1 and fa 2 is shown in fig 8 obviously the wave height under fa 0 is restrained significantly and the effect is highly sensitive to installation height of appendage when the appendage is installed at a high position fig 8 b only middle and rear parts of the appendage touch the wave surface moreover wake flow at the rear of the appendage impacts on gunwale to produce water spraying when the appendage is installed at a low position fig 8 c it is fixed below wave making surface at the bow and it cannot suppress wave making effectively the calculated total resistance coefficients of ship model under fa 0 fa 1 and fa 2 are shown in table 8 the total resistance coefficient of bare hull minus total resistance coefficient of the hull with appendage and then divided by total resistance coefficient of the bare hull the result is corresponded as the resistance reduction rate if the resistance reduction rate is positive appendage can reduce resistance also the appendage position of fa 0 can reduce resistance of ship model effectively this shows that restraining the wave of high speed ships can decrease wave making resistance of ships in addition the resistance reduction rate varies with installation position of the appendage hence it is necessary to choose an appropriate installation position for the bow appendage it is shown in fig 8 and table 8 that the resistance reduction rate varies with installation position of the appendage and an appropriate installation position should be chosen according to the wave pattern of the ship with the speed at which the best resistance reduction effect needs to have for this ship model the design point of bow appendage is set to reduce the ship resistance at v m 3 452 m s fr 0 45 so fa 0 is in consistent with the target furthermore the wave pattern and resistance of the ship model with fa 0 at v m 3 146 m s and v m 3 790 m s are calculated using cfd respectively and the results are shown in fig 9 and table 9 as shown in fig 9 and table 9 at a higher speed of 3 790 m s the trim angle of the hull increase the appendage at the bow moves up accordingly and does not fully restrain the wave which is similar to the state of fa 1 as shown in fig 8 b at a lower speed of 3 146 m s the trim angle of the hull decrease the appendage on the bow moves down and part of the appendage is mounted below the wave surface therefore the resistance reduction rate of the appendage at a speed of 3 146 m s and 3 790 m s are less than that at a speed of 3 452 m s 4 model test of bow appendage 4 1 verification of resistance reduction effect resistance reduction of bow appendage was verified by a model experiment with the ship model section 2 fa 0 was installed on the ship model accurately through 3d printing photograph of the ship model with fa 0 are shown in fig 10 a towing experiment of the ship model with fa 0 in the tank was carried out wave pattern pictures at bow of the ship model under four typical navigation speeds are shown in fig 11 according to experimental wave pattern pictures at the bow of the ship model the appendage can affect waves at the bow under different typical navigation speeds comparing fig 11 b fig 11 c fig 11 d with fig 9 a fig 8 a fig 9 b respectively it is found that the calculated wave pattern is consistent with the experimental phenomenon so this new resistance reduction method is feasible in practice however the splash on both sides of the hull is captured insufficiently in numerical simulation which results in some errors in the calculations of resistance reduction rate the measurement results of resistance sinkage and trim of the ship model with fa 0 are listed in table 10 and the experiment results of the bare hull are also presented in the table as shown in table 10 when froude number is higher than 0 4 the appendage at the bow is able to reduce the total resistance of ship model according to test results the trim angle of the hull is increased slightly due to the hydrodynamic lift of the appendage and the values of the experimental resistance reduction ratio at the speeds of 3 146 m s 3 452 m s and 3 790 m s are all less than the calculated results especially under the influence of strong splash when the speed is 3 790 m s 4 2 test of improved appendage it can be seen from fig 11 d that there is an evidence in the tail flow at the stern of appendage when the navigation speed is 3 79 m s this tail flow causes evident water spraying on the hull moreover the relevant resistance reduction rate declines high froude number is conducive to increase trim angle of hull and trim of the appendage in relative to the wave surface the section at the tail end of the appendage is inserted into the high speed free surface flow and it induces the strong tail flows to improve this phenomenon fa 0 extends backward naturally along the longitudinal direction to contact with the hull directly thus eliminating the tail section of the appendage in this way a modified appendage fa m is formed in this study fa m was manufactured by 3d printing to replace fa 0 similarly the towing experiment of ship model with fa m was carried out wave pattern pictures at the bow of the ship model under four typical navigation speeds are shown in fig 12 and the experiment resistance results are shown in table 11 the comparisons of wave pattern pictures in figs 11 d and fig 12 d show that the fa m can control the water spraying caused by fa 0 at fr 0 494 effectively under other navigation speeds wave pattern caused by fa m is different from that caused by fa 0 at stern according to resistance reduction rate in table 11 fa 0 is better than fa m when navigation speed is lower than 3 452 m s and the froude number is lower than 0 45 this is because a large appendage can increase viscous resistance and trim angle of hull however fa m is better than fa 0 when the navigation speed is higher than 3 452 m s and the froude number is higher than 0 45 as shown in fig 11 d the spray induced by fa 0 is very strong at the speed of 3 790 m s and severe appendage spray would increase the resistance since the spray caused by fa m is much smaller than that of fa 0 the resistance caused by the spray is reduced by fa m as shown in fig 12 which extends the resistance reduction rate further 5 conclusions traditional techniques to reduce wave making resistance such as bulbous bow and anti wave hydrofoil all decrease wave making resistance of ship hull by inducing a wave to counteract the original hull bow wave however bulbous bow and anti wave hydrofoil are difficult to reduce resistance of high speed ships effectively when froude number ranges from 0 4 to 0 5 in this study a new bow appendage which is installed at the appropriate position of the bow is proposed to reduce the ship resistance numerical calculation and resistance experiments based on a high speed ship model were carried out in this study wave patterns of the ship model with appendage were simulated and the resistance of the ship model was calculated according to the calculated results the appendage that is able to

21856,a new type of bow appendage is proposed to reduce resistance of high speed ship with a froude number of 0 4 0 5 in this paper the ship bow appendage can restrain the bow waves of high speed ships thus enabling to decrease the principal wave making resistance significantly in this study resistance experiments and numerical simulation calculations on a ship model were carried out this new type of bow appendage was designed according to wave pattern of the ship model at the froude number of 0 45 aiming to restrain the peak of bow wave numerical calculation shows that the bow appendage can affect the wave making state and reduce the resistance of ship model at high speed and the effect of the bow appendage is sensitive to its installation position and the model speed the ship model experiments were conducted to verify the effects of the bow appendage on reducing the resistance of ship model experiment results show that this bow appendage is able to restrain bow wave of the ship model and reduce the total resistance by more than 8 to the maximum extent the water spray induced by the bow appendage can be improved by optimization of the shape keywords bow appendage resistance reduction wave making resistance high speed ship 1 introduction reducing the resistance of ship is conducive to increasing the speed of ship and reducing energy consumption resistance of ships mainly includes frictional resistance viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance for low speed ships the frictional resistance accounts for the largest proportion of total resistance friction resistance can be reduced by using antifouling coatings yigit kemal demirel et al 2014 micro grooved surfaces liu et al 2007 and lubrication air layers jamie butterworth et al 2015 the wave making resistance originates from disturbances of ship to the water and air interface which increases dramatically with the increase of navigation speed of ships for high speed displacement ships the proportion of wave making resistance in total resistance is higher than 50 therefore reducing wave making resistance is vital to lower the ships resistance major techniques to reduce ships wave making resistance are introduced as follows hull form optimization technique based on numerical calculation and optimization algorithm of wave making resistance this technique is used to design a hull form with the minimum wave making resistance by combining certain constraints siung 1981 bao et al 2015 calculated the ship wave making resistance by rankine source method through which they concluded the minimum resistance hull form kostas et al 2015 studied the ship hull optimization method using t spline based on boundary element method wavelet method was put forward by zhao et al 2015 to optimize ship wave resistance andrea et al 2016 optimized hydrodynamics of ships by local hybridization of deterministic derivative free global algorithms with the progresses on multidisciplinary optimization algorithms hull form optimization has been developed from the simple optimization of wave making resistance to optimization of comprehensive navigation performances the hull form optimization technique has some shortcomings firstly the hull form with the minimum wave making resistance might be related to the speed range secondly one hull form is difficult to achieve low wave making resistance in the whole range of navigation speed kim et al 2008 feng et al 2018 thirdly almost the hull forms are restricted by floating ability stability arrangement and loading resulting in the limited space for hull form optimization bulbous bow technique this technique designs the front part of a ship below the water surface into a spherical bow the bulbous bow also induces wave making however this wave is opposite to the first transverse wave of the original hull s bow wave system as a result the total wave resistance of ships can be reduced wang and lu 2006 jin and young 2017 according to theoretical and experimental studies bulbous bow technique can effectively reduce wave making resistance for the low speed or moderate speed ships when froude number is smaller than 0 35 but it is difficult to reduce the resistance of high speed ships significantly with froude number over 0 4 anti wave hydrofoil technique this technique is to install hydrofoils at the fore of ships below the water surface lu et al 2008 pointed out that hydrofoil can reduce wave making resistance by changing wave making form of the bow during high navigation speed of ships anti wave hydrofoil technique also has a disadvantage according to model test and numerical calculations reducing resistance of anti wave hydrofoil can only be realized through extremely high speed navigation when froude number is higher than 0 5 however such navigation speed is beyond the ability of most displacement ships all over the world yet since the navigation state of high speed ships changes greatly a stern plate resistance reduction technology that can decrease trim of hull and increase virtual stern length has been developed zheng et al 2011 this technology can reduce the resistance under the appropriate working conditions bulbous bow and anti wave hydrofoil can reduce wave making resistance by producing opposite phase waves to the original bow wave induced by ship hull but they fail to decrease resistance of high speed ships with froude number ranging between 0 4 and 0 5 to address these problems a new type of bow appendage technology was proposed or designed it can directly restrain wave peak of bow change the distribution of the pressure field on the ship hull and finally reduce wave making resistance and total resistance of high speed ships 2 resistance experiment and numerical calculation of a high speed ship model generally speaking hydrodynamic resistance takes the dominant role in total resistance of bare hull hydrodynamic resistance of bare hull can be divided into frictional resistance viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance their proportions in total resistance are closely related with hull form and navigation speed of ships for conventional high speed displacement mono hull ships the length breadth ratio is generally higher than 7 while the block coefficient is generally lower than 0 55 conventional high speed displacement mono hull ships generally have a slim hull which has a square stern the viscous pressure resistance accounts for a small proportion of the total resistance however the proportion of wave making resistance increases quickly with the increase of navigation speed in this study a resistance experiment and a numerical calculation of wave making flow field were carried out based on a ship model with the scale ratio of 1 20 the geometry of the ship model is shown in fig 1 main parameters are listed in table 1 in this experiment resistance components of ships and wave pattern produced by the bow were analyzed this is because weight and center of gravity cg position of the ship model need to be adjusted by placing and moving weights inside the ship before the experiment the hull cannot be closed by the deck moreover the freeboard height of ship model was increased to 0 35m in the experiment 2 1 resistance experiments of the ship model a resistance experiment of the ship model was conducted in a towing tank with 320m in length 10m in width and 5m in depth the ship model was towed by the carriage in the tank the towing speed of the carriage could reach 7 m s and the speed precision was controlled at 0 1 in order to analyze the test error the resistance experiments of the ship model under every towing speed has been performed three times test results are shown in table 2 where v m is speed of the ship model and fr is froude number that uses waterline length of the ship model as the reference length froude number is defined as follows 1 f r v m g l w l note that the stern trim is negative in table 2 the errors of the test resistance results are analyzed and shown in table 3 here the error is the maximum of the three test values minus the minimum and then divided by the average it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that test values of resistance sinkage and trim of the ship model under different towing speeds are very similar in three tests which proves the high stability and accuracy of the testing system especially when the ship model speed exceeds 2 685 m s the relative errors of the resistance test results are less than 1 because the absolute value of the trim is very small its relative test error is slightly larger wave patterns produced by bow of the ship model under four froude numbers are shown in fig 2 a significant positive relation between the height of the wave peak of bow and the towing speed was observed the total resistance coefficient of the ship model c t which is calculated by the averaged experiment results and the frictional resistance coefficients c f which is calculated from the formula ittc 57 are listed in table 4 re is the reynolds number which uses waterline length of the ship model as the reference length c r represents residual resistance coefficient of the ship model the relationship of these three resistance coefficients is as follows 2 c t r t 0 5 ρ v m 2 s 3 c r c t c f where r t is total resistance of the ship model and s is wetted area of the ship model obviously the proportion of residual resistance coefficient in total resistance coefficient is higher than 60 when the froude number exceeds 0 4 although residual resistance includes wave making resistance and viscous pressure resistance the proportion of viscous pressure resistance of high speed ships with slim hulls is generally about 10 hence wave making resistance is the main component of resistance of high speed ships which have a froude number higher than 0 41 key attentions should be paid to decrease wave making resistance of high speed ships 2 2 numerical simulation of the ship model at present it is an important way to calculate the ship hydrodynamics and flow field by the method of computational fluid dynamics cfd hafizul and carlos 2019b predicted resistance of container ship by cfd and discussed effects of trim on the ship resistance under different speeds and drafts pablo et al 2016 studied the zigzag maneuver of kcs container ship in shallow water by cfd and found high consistence between cfd predictions and experimental results of most variables yavuz and baris 2017 calculated ship motions and resistance of kvlcc2 model at a constant forward velocity they demonstrated that ship resistance pitch and heave motions in regular head waves could be estimated accurately the accuracy of cfd calculation in flow field and hydrodynamic force of ships under constant speed straight movement have been verified hafizul and carlos 2019a in this study resistance of the ship model as well as sinkage and trim of the hull under different navigation speeds was calculated using cfd cfd method gets a numerical solution to flow field from the generalized fluid continuity equation and momentum equations a time average navier stokes equation and turbulence model were applied to solve complexity of turbulence the time average continuity equation of fluid as well as the time average navier stokes equations is 4 ρ u i x i 0 5 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 μ u l x l δ i j x j ρ u i u j ρ f i where ρ is the density u i denotes the averaged cartesian components of the velocity vector p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity and f i denotes the body forces the reynolds stresses ρ u i u j needs to be calculated to solve unclosed equations therefore it is necessary to introduce in a turbulence model the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model is integrated effectively with the k ε model in the far field and with the k ω model near the wall in high accuracy calculation of ship hydrodynamics hence sst k ω turbulence model was applied in the present study details of the sst k ω turbulence model had been introduced by andrea et al 2018 the sinkage and trim might be produced when froude number is higher than 0 4 these sinkage and trim behaviors cannot be ignored due to hydrodynamic forces therefore motion of the hull must be taken into account in numerical calculation this requires six degrees of freedom dofs mode to calculate resistance and flow field of ships under constant speed straight navigation the roll yaw and sway of the hull can be restricted in this way only three dofs have to be chosen and calculated in the mode in this study ship motion and resistance are simulated in fine marine with the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse and coupling six degree of freedom equations the embedded vof method can accurately capture the complex wave pattern the establishment of computational domain and grids is the basis for calculating ship model resistance using cfd method the computational domain and boundary conditions for the resistance calculation of ship model are shown in fig 3 since the hull is symmetrical it is only necessary to calculate the flow field of the half hull as shown in fig 3 the boundary condition of inlet is set as velocity inlet and the inflow velocity component is defined according to the ship model velocity the boundary condition of outlet is set as pressure outlet and the inflow pressure is defined as undisturbed pressure the boundary conditions of top bottom and side are set as far field conditions the boundary condition of hull is set as no slip wall condition the verification of the ship model resistance calculation by cfd is carried out according to the recommended procedure of 22nd ittc verification is defined as a process for assessing simulation numerical uncertainty u sn iterative and parameter convergence studies are conducted using multiple solutions and systematic parameter refinement so three sets of computational grids are created with the grid refinement ratio r g 2 as shown in fig 4 grid 1 is the fine grid with the grid number of 4 35 millions grid 2 is the middle grid with the grid number of 1 76 millions grid 3 is the coarse grid with the grid number of 0 69 millions the meshing density of bow and stern is high and the meshing density of the midship is low moreover a block of high meshing density was set close to the bow to improve calculation resolution of the bow wave pattern the calculated resistance results of the half hull at different speeds with these grids are shown in table 5 the numerical simulation uncertainty u sn are decomposed into uncertainty of grid size u g uncertainty of time step u t uncertainty of iteration u i and uncertainty of other parameters u p the expression of u sn is written as 6 u sn u g u t u i u p because in this process of the ship model resistance numerical calculation time step depends on the speed of the ship model and the grid size the uncertainty of time step u t is included in the uncertainty of grid size u g uncertainty of iteration u i reflects the influence of the iteration number on the calculation result fig 5 shows the time history curves of the calculated resistance of half hull and it can be seen that the calculated results hardly change with the iteration number and time after the calculation converges zhang et al 2008 had proved that uncertainty of iteration u i is two orders of magnitude smaller than uncertainty of grid size u g in the process of gird meshing and numerical calculations other parameters remain unchanged thus uncertainty of other parameters u p is negligible so in this ship model resistance numerical calculation it can be considered that the simulation numerical uncertainty u sn is approximately equal to the uncertainty of grid size u g based on the recommended procedure of 22nd ittc the verification of this ship model resistance calculated by numerical simulation finished and the results are shown in table 6 in table 6 r k is the converge ratio p k is the order of accuracy c k is the correction factor u sn is the simulation numerical uncertainty because r k is less than 1 for every speed the convergence of this numerical simulation by cfd is satisfied the simulation numerical uncertainty u sn is less than 1 in order to ensure the accuracy of the calculation by cfd the fine meshing scheme is used in the numerical simulation the calculated total resistance coefficients of ship model were compared to the experimental results table 7 as shown in table 7 the calculated results are in accord with the experimental results wave patterns at bow of ship model in numerical simulation are shown in fig 6 the changes of calculated wave pattern with navigation speed conform to experiment as shown in fig 2 the wave height is positively related to the navigation speed since the wave making resistance is proportional to square of wave height it increases dramatically with the increase of navigation speed in the wave system of ships the transverse wave of bow has the highest the wave making resistance can be decreased significantly as long as the wave height at bow of the high speed ship model can be restrained 3 numerical calculation of bow appendage a new type of the bow appendage is designed in the present study to restrain the bow wave of the high speed ship model in order to reduce the wave making resistance the resistance reduction principle of bow appendage is significantly different from those of traditional bulbous bow and anti wave hydrofoil to restrain the wave produced by bow effectively the new appendage is installed at the position of bow where is close to the water surface position and size of the appendage need to be designed according to wave pattern at bow the actual design speed of the full scale vessel is 30kn and the corresponding froude number is 0 45 so the wave pattern of the ship model with high froude number of 0 45 is applied as the design point the wave pattern at the bow was gotten from numerical simulation by cfd as shown in fig 6 the bow appendage fig 7 is designed preliminarily according to this wave pattern resistance of the ship model with a bow appendage which has a froude number of 0 45 was calculated by the numerical calculation method in section 2 2 to further discussion influences of installation position of the appendage on resistance reduction the installation height was moved upward and downward by 0 03m in the initial scheme from which three appendage states fa 0 fa 1 and fa 2 were obtained fa 0 stands for the initial bow appendage scheme and it is installed at the position where the front end of the appendage is just on the still water fa 1 stands for the bow appendage scheme moved upward and fa 2 stands for the bow appendage scheme moved downward to ensure the accuracy and validity of the calculated results the same meshing scheme in section 2 2 was applied in this calculation of the ship model with bow appendage blocks of high density meshing were also set at the bow which have the same sizes and positions wave patterns under the influence of bow appendage and resistance of the ship model were calculated in the calculation the navigation speed of the ship model was set to 3 452 m s which corresponds to the design point of bow appendage with the froude number of 0 45 the numerical calculation results of the wave patterns are shown in fig 8 comparison of the wave patterns fa 0 fa 1 and fa 2 is shown in fig 8 obviously the wave height under fa 0 is restrained significantly and the effect is highly sensitive to installation height of appendage when the appendage is installed at a high position fig 8 b only middle and rear parts of the appendage touch the wave surface moreover wake flow at the rear of the appendage impacts on gunwale to produce water spraying when the appendage is installed at a low position fig 8 c it is fixed below wave making surface at the bow and it cannot suppress wave making effectively the calculated total resistance coefficients of ship model under fa 0 fa 1 and fa 2 are shown in table 8 the total resistance coefficient of bare hull minus total resistance coefficient of the hull with appendage and then divided by total resistance coefficient of the bare hull the result is corresponded as the resistance reduction rate if the resistance reduction rate is positive appendage can reduce resistance also the appendage position of fa 0 can reduce resistance of ship model effectively this shows that restraining the wave of high speed ships can decrease wave making resistance of ships in addition the resistance reduction rate varies with installation position of the appendage hence it is necessary to choose an appropriate installation position for the bow appendage it is shown in fig 8 and table 8 that the resistance reduction rate varies with installation position of the appendage and an appropriate installation position should be chosen according to the wave pattern of the ship with the speed at which the best resistance reduction effect needs to have for this ship model the design point of bow appendage is set to reduce the ship resistance at v m 3 452 m s fr 0 45 so fa 0 is in consistent with the target furthermore the wave pattern and resistance of the ship model with fa 0 at v m 3 146 m s and v m 3 790 m s are calculated using cfd respectively and the results are shown in fig 9 and table 9 as shown in fig 9 and table 9 at a higher speed of 3 790 m s the trim angle of the hull increase the appendage at the bow moves up accordingly and does not fully restrain the wave which is similar to the state of fa 1 as shown in fig 8 b at a lower speed of 3 146 m s the trim angle of the hull decrease the appendage on the bow moves down and part of the appendage is mounted below the wave surface therefore the resistance reduction rate of the appendage at a speed of 3 146 m s and 3 790 m s are less than that at a speed of 3 452 m s 4 model test of bow appendage 4 1 verification of resistance reduction effect resistance reduction of bow appendage was verified by a model experiment with the ship model section 2 fa 0 was installed on the ship model accurately through 3d printing photograph of the ship model with fa 0 are shown in fig 10 a towing experiment of the ship model with fa 0 in the tank was carried out wave pattern pictures at bow

evidence in the tail flow at the stern of appendage when the navigation speed is 3 79 m s this tail flow causes evident water spraying on the hull moreover the relevant resistance reduction rate declines high froude number is conducive to increase trim angle of hull and trim of the appendage in relative to the wave surface the section at the tail end of the appendage is inserted into the high

caused by fa m is different from that caused by fa 0 at stern according to resistance reduction rate in table 11 fa 0 is better than fa m when navigation speed is lower than 3 452 m s and the froude number is lower than 0 45 this is because a large appendage can increase viscous resistance and trim angle of hull however fa m is better than fa 0 when the navigation speed is higher than 3 452 m s

21857,a numerical study was conducted to investigate the stern flap effects on catamaran s hydrodynamic performance in regular waves an unsteady rans code hust ship was used to predict the catamaran hydrodynamic performance in different sea states experimental tests were performed to assess the accuracy of the cfd code validation of the numerical method was conducted for time steps grid independent studies and uncertainty analysis of the numerical simulation results includes evaluation of resistance and ship motions the comparisons of cfd and efd results agree well with each other then numerical studies on the stern flaps effect for the catamaran s hydrodynamic performance in regular head waves were presented different lengths of stern flaps have been considered the effects of stern flap on resistance heave and pitch motions were evaluated for different wave lengths and amplitudes the catamaran s resistance heave and pitch motions reached peak values near the resonance frequency of the catamaran models the results demonstrate that both the resistance and ship motions could be reduced when install the stern flap for the catamaran keywords catamaran stern flap cfd ship motion regular head wave seakeeping characteristic 1 introduction the catamaran is made up with two demi hulls in recent years catamarans have attracted growing attention and have been the relatively good choice for both civil transportation and naval vessels sahoo et al 2006 zhou et al 2014 as one of high speed ships catamaran can provide a relatively wide deck compared with mono hull deng and deng 2015 however a ship is often optimized on its rapidity in calm water when advancing in the sea the ship may provide a relatively poor seakeeping performance due to large vertical resonant motions castiglione et al 2011 the conventional catamaran is easily vulnerable from the deck diving in following seas lavroffa et al 2017 as a matter of fact it provoked the need about the optimization for hydrodynamic performance of the catamarans for the hydrodynamic optimization of the high speed ships some transom appendages installed behind the stern have been considered for playing a role in the improvement of resistance and seakeeping characteristic of ships several studies have been carried out for the use of these appendages karafiath and fisher 1987 gained the experimental and numerical results about the effect of stern wedges and stern flaps the results showed that full scale ship gained great powering reduction by using the stern wedges and stern flaps tsai and hwang 2004 conducted several experiments in order to research the effect of stern flap and interceptor for ship resistance reduction the experimental results indicated that the reduction of trim and resistance has been found for the high speed ships when installed the proper stern flap and interceptor karimi et al 2015 focused on the impact of controllable interceptors for the hydrodynamic performance of a planning craft both experimental and theoretical methods have been used for the research and a model of which the vertical motion could be controlled with interceptors both in calm water and head waves was used for the research using modern optimal control theory and savitsky s method the simulated results gained agreed well with the experimental data and both data showed that the controlled interceptors could be applied for reducing the resistance of the planning craft and heave and pitch motions especially near the resonant frequency mansoori et al 2017 investigated the effect of interceptor with different sizes and optimized the size of interceptors the research found that the interceptor could reduce the resistance and control sailing attitude of ship when the height of interceptor is less than 60 percent of boundary layer thickness at stern some other researches brizzolara 2003 day and cooper 2011 mansoori and fernandes 2015 also have been published which aimed to optimize the hydrodynamic performance of the high speed ships using such easily installed appendages many researches have been conducted for the effect of stern flaps the installation of stern flaps on ships began relatively early in the end of the 20th century the stern flap has been applied on large sized u s navy combatant judging from the experimental data the ship resistance could be prominently reduced when using the stern flap cusanelli and cave 1993 cusanelli and karafiath 2001 the reason of the effect caused by stern flap has been the focus of the research amacher et al 2015 presented a stern flap with optimized shape and assessed it by field tests the results showed that the reduction of wave energy have been caused using this flap ghadimi et al 2016 presented a stern flap with new shape and made a study on the effect of this stern flap using a 3d numerical analysis the results showed that this stern flap could influence the flow around the ship and reduce the wave resistance maki et al 2016 aimed to explain the reason of the resistance reduction caused by stern flaps and both experiment and numerical simulation have been conducted their results clarified that the installation of stern flaps could change the wave pattern behind the stern and then make an improvement on pressure distribution song et al 2018 conducted a systematic research of the effect of stern flaps and interceptors on hydrodynamic performance of a deep vee ship in calm water and the results showed that the proper combination of stern flap and interceptor could reduce the ship resistance and control sailing attitude effectively in calm water plenty of efforts have been focused on developing numerical methods for the prediction of catamaran seakeeping performance the motion characteristics for high speed wave piercing catamaran in waves were simulated by numerical method fang and chan 2004 the numerical results showed a good agreement with experimental data from sspa however lower error was found for the pitch motion when the encounter frequency was around the resonance region because of the nonlinear effects of center bow with large pitch motions in waves moraes et al 2004 used two methods to predict the wave resistance of the high speed catamaran and the effects of hull spacing were studied the results showed that the elevation of the wave resistance coefficient curve becomes greater with the decrease of the spacing when froude number is around 0 5 castiglione et al 2011 applied an urans code for the numerical simulation of the seakeeping behavior of a catamaran and the numerical results were compared well with the experimental data the study showed that the accuracy of simulation results using urans method is higher than the strip theory solutions and nonlinear effects could be considered using urans method they also found that the maximum of ship motions occurred near the resonance frequency and the maximum value of pitch motion occurred lower than resonance frequency bouscasse et al 2013 investigated the seakeeping performance of a catamaran in transient regular and irregular head waves they conducted repeatability analysis in order to certify the experimental data and it has been proved as a valuable database for the research of hydrodynamic performance of catamarans fitriadhy et al 2018 aimed to research the seakeeping performance of one deep v high speed catamaran with cfd method and the effect of different froude number wave length and wave height for heave and pitch motions of catamaran have been studied this paper presents a numerical study of seakeeping characteristics for a catamaran with stern flap advancing in regular head wave an inhouse cfd code hust ship was used to predict the resistance and motion of the catamaran in wave with without stern flap experimental studies were conducted to validate the numerical method uncertainty analysis of numerical method had been performed to minimize the numerical error of the cfd code the effects of stern flap with different lengths on the catamaran seakeeping characteristics in regular head wave has been studied for different wave lengths and amplitudes spectra analysis of the unsteady motion of catamaran on wave condition was performed for comparisons comparisons between the bare hull model and model with different stern flaps show that stern flaps could improve the resistance and seakeeping performance of catamaran in regular head wave 2 objective of study 2 1 catamaran model a catamaran model was selected as the object of the study including numerical simulation and experimental test the model is made up by two symmetrical demi hulls with a sharp bow and a transom stern fig 1 shows the geometry of the catamaran model with stern flap and table 1 shows the main parameters of catamaran model 2 2 geometry of stern flap table 2 shows the values of specific parameters of different stern flaps selected for this study fig 2 shows the geometry of the stern flap since the installation of stern flap could lead to the increase of wetted surface area of catamaran which would increase the ship friction resistance the lengths of stern flaps l are 80 mm and 160 mm corresponding to 3 and 6 of the ship length at waterline in this study the span is taken across the transom and the installation angle of different stern flap is constant the bare hull without stern flap has also been considered in the study to understand the effect of stern flap on the catamaran model 3

cartesian coordinate systems are employed to describe the ship motions including an absolute inertial earth fixed coordinate system and a relative non inertial ship fixed coordinate system as shown in fig 3 positive x y and z represent aft starboard and upward direction respectively in the cartesian earth fixed and ship fixed coordinate system ship fixed coordinate system moves with the motions of ship and its origin o is always fixed at the center of gravity of the ship 3 2 numerical towing tank and boundary conditions the numerical tank dimensions were set to 1 0 x l wl 4 0 1 0 y l wl 1 0 and 1 0 z l wl 1 0 for the catamaran model advancing in regular head waves which is depicted in fig 4 the ship length is on the x axis with the bow at x 0 and the stern at x 1l wl the free surface is at z 0 the boundary conditions are described in fig 4 the velocity inlet boundary condition is applied on the front end of the numerical tank the pressure outlet boundary condition is applied on the exit the zero pressure boundary condition is applied on the bottom zero pressure gradient boundary conditions are applied on two sides and top no slip boundary conditions are applied on the surfaces of the catamaran hull 3 3 wave generating method linear regular wave theory is used to simulate regular waves by wave length and wave amplitude of incident wave regular wave can be generated by defining the boundary condition of numerical tank the free surface position at the inlet of numerical tank is set as 9 η t a c o s k x ω t φ the velocity components at the inlet are set as 10 u a ω cosh k z d sinh

coefficient in this simulation wave damping range is 3 0 x l wl 4 0 and as 2 3 5 numerical wave tank numerical regular wave tank was developed for catamaran seakeeping characteristic studies in order to evaluate the accuracy of numerical wave tank a point in front of the ship was selected to monitor the change of wave elevation over time the comparison between cfd simulation results for the regular head wave λ l wl 1 15 a l wl 0 10 and the corresponding theoretical wave amplitude curve is shown in fig 5 as can be seen the regular wave generated by the numerical wave tank is satisfactory 3 6 overset grid technology the idea of overset grids arose from the need to model multicomponent systems where an optimum body fitted grid is used for each component by allowing arbitrary overlap between neighboring grids each grid in an overset system can be generated independently from one another where the sole focus can be on maintaining high grid cell quality such as orthogonality and clustering this flexibility typically results in significantly better grid quality compared to the tightly constrained abutting grid approach where grid points on the boundaries of neighboring grids are required to coincide with each other exactly moreover the overset approach allows local modifications to the geometry such as addition or removal of a component without the need to regenerate the entire grid system boger and dreyer 2006 chan 2009 the structured overset grid technology used in this study is almost same as the scheme of the reference boger and dreyer 2006 chan 2009 for the grid generation the total grid consists of two part grids as depicted in fig 6 one is hull grid and the other is numerical tank for the hull the grid on the boundary layer are small enough y 1 in order to capture the boundary layer several refinements have been created around the bow and stern of catamaran where the flow is relatively complex in the numerical tank the grid at the free surface is refined to capture the wave pattern accurately for the numerical simulation of the model in head waves the numerical tank needs to be refined including at least 50 grid points per wavelength and 20 grid points per wave height based on ittc recommendation the hull grid is embedded in the numerical tank using overset grid technology the grid nodes inside the hull grid are removed but several layers of oversetting nodes are remained these remaining nodes are prepared for interpolation which is used to exchange each grid data at the boundary of the oversetting region to complete the calculation of the entire flow field as depicted in fig 6 4 verification and validation estimation of the numerical modelling errors using asme v v 2009 validation procedure the american society of mechanical engineers 2009 2016 requires experimental data and its uncertainties numerical simulations and its uncertainties and input parameter uncertainties the input parameters uncertainty is assumed to be zero the experiment tests including resistance tests in calm water and regular wave have been carried out for the catamaran model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm in order to validate the numerical method verification and validation works have been conducted for the catamaran model advancing in calm water and regular head wave at fn 0 885 4 1 verification of cfd code 4 1 1 resistance in calm water systematic grid convergence study time convergence study and iterative convergence study have been carried out according to the method stern et al 2001 xing and stern 2010 according to this method the convergence factor r was defined as 15 r s f s m s m s c when 0 r 1 monotonic convergence is achieved and richardson extrapolation method was used the estimated order of accuracy p re was calculated as 16 p r e ln s m s c s f s m ln r a distance metric p to the asymptotic range is used defined as the ratio of p re to p th the factor of safety method uncertainty is given as 17 u f s 2 45 0 85 p s f s m r p r e 1 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 s f s m r p r e 1 p 1 for the grid convergence verification three different grids were generated with the grid refinement ratio r g 2 corresponding to coarse 1 45 million grid points medium 4 09 million grid points and fine 11 5 million grid points the grid convergence study was based on the medium time step and the results simulated by the coarse medium and fine grids were signed as s gc s gm and s gf respectively shown in table 3 three time steps were used with the refinement ratio r t 2 corresponding to coarse δt 0 0071 medium δt 0 005 and fine δt 0 0035 the time step convergence study was based on the medium grid and the results simulated for three time steps were signed as s tc s tm and s tf shown in table 4 iterative convergence study was conducted on the medium grid and medium time step and the errors were at least one order of magnitude smaller than the grid and time step errors from tables 3 and 4 thus the iterative errors could be neglected results of grid and time step convergence studies for the resistance of the catamaran model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm advancing in calm water at highest speed fn 0 885 were summarized in table 5 for both grid and time step the convergence factor r was between 0 and 1 which meant that the monotonic convergence was achieved and then the factor of safety method could be used to calculate the numerical uncertainties from the table 5 it can be observed that the uncertainties of grid and time step were 0 88 s gf and 0 36 s tf respectively as can be seen u g values are obviously higher than u t which indicates that the grid errors are the major source of the numerical uncertainty what s more the grid and time step convergence was achieved satisfactorily 4 1 2 unsteady motions of the catamaran in regular head wave the same method has been used for the verification study of unsteady motions of the model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm in regular head wave including heave and pitch motions the wave condition where the amplitudes of ship motions are relatively large were chosen for the verification study fn 0 885 λ l wl 2 a l wl 0 0129 i yy l wl 0 35 the verification parameters are the transfer functions tf 3 and tf 5 of heave and pitch motions three different grids were generated with the grid refinement ratio r g 2 corresponding to coarse 3 09 million grid points medium 4 77 million grid points and fine 9 50 million grid points three time steps were also used with the refinement ratio r t 2 corresponding to coarse δt 0 0071 medium δt 0 0050 and fine δt 0 0035 for both grid and time step the convergence factor r was between 0 and 1 indicating that the monotonic convergence was achieved and the factor of safety method could be used to obtain the uncertainties the results of grid and time step convergence study were shown in table 6 and the verification results were shown in table 7 overall verification results demonstrate good convergence performance for both grid and time step as a result the medium grid and medium time step were selected for the next numerical study 4 2 validation of the cfd code validation of numerical method is used to assess the simulation modeling uncertainty u d using the experimental data for the validation study the results from numerical simulations were compared to the experimental data the validation uncertainty u v is calculated as 18 u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 where u d is the experimental uncertainty and u sn is the numerical uncertainty which is calculated as 19 u s n 2 u g 2 u t 2 u i 2 where u g is the uncertainty from grid convergence study u t is the uncertainty from time step convergence study and u i is the iterative uncertainty which could be neglected the comparison error e is defined as 20 e d s where d is the experimental data and s is the result from numerical simulation the experimental tests of the catamaran model were conducted at the laboratory of ship model towing tank of naval architecture ocean engineering college of huazhong university of science and technology which is 175 m long 6 m wide and 4 m deep the catamaran model installed with stern flap 1 l 80 mm was considered as the object of experimental tests experimental data for the catamaran model advancing in calm water includes ship resistance over a speed range between fn 0 537 to fn 0 885 fn is the froude number and defined as 21 f n v g l w l where v is the sailing speed of ship g is the acceleration due to gravity and l wl is ship length at waterline the experiments aimed to validate the reliability of numerical method used in this study fig 7 shows the model in experimental tests the experimental data in regular head wave includes time histories of catamaran s motion for different wave lengths ranging from λ lwl 1 to λ lwl 2 with corresponding wave amplitudes at fn 0 885 the details of test conditions are shown in table 8 and numerical simulations have been carried out for the same conditions in order to compare the numerical results with the experimental data and then validate the numerical method in the experiment tests the dimensionless longitudinal radius of inertia i yy l wl was 0 35 4 2 1 resistance in calm water the results of validation study about model resistance in calm water are shown in table 9 the validation study shows that the comparison error e is lower than the validation uncertainty u v which indicates that the simulation results are validated under the u v level fig 8 shows the comparison between cfd simulation results and the experimental data for total resistance of the catamaran model installed with stern flap 1 l 80 mm at different speeds the total resistance coefficient is defined as 22 c t r t 0 5 ρ v 2 s where r t is the total resistance s is wetted surface area of the hull model and v is the sailing velocity of model as shown in fig 8 the results of total resistance from hust ship cfd code agree well with the experimental data for all speeds fig 9 shows the wave pattern of the free surface for the catamaran model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm advancing in calm water at different values of fn simulated by hust ship cfd code the wave pattern around the model in calm water is helpful to analyze the ship resistance as can be observed in fig 9 the kelvin wave pattern is evident obvious wave crest is formed at the bow and obvious wave though behind the stern it could be also observed that higher wave crest is formed between two demi hulls and the wave crest region becomes longer with the increase of fn which is caused by the interference effects between the wave systems of two demi hulls with the increase of fn the wave making region behind the stern becomes lankier and the major wave trough and crest move far away from the stern 4 2 2 unsteady motion of the catamaran in regular head wave seakeeping experimental tests for several conditions have been conducted in order to validate the numerical method table 10 shows the results of validation study about model s unsteady motion in regular head wave the results show that the comparison error e of ship pitch motion is lower than the validation uncertainty u v which indicates that the simulation results are validated under the u v level three wave lengths λ 1l wl 1 5l wl and λ 2l wl have been selected for regular head wave tests at one speed fn 0 885 fig 10 and fig 11 show the comparison between numerical simulation results from hust ship and experimental data including the time history amplitude and period of pitch motion of model it can be observed that the numerical results from hust ship show a good agreement with the experimental data 5 results and discussion 5 1 simulation conditions the numerical simulations are conducted in regular head waves for models with without different stern flaps including bare hull hull with flap 1 and hull with flap 2 simulations are carried out at different wave lengths and amplitudes at a relatively high speed of the model fn 0 885 wave lengths ranging from λ l wl 1 to λ l wl 2 5 at fn 0 885 and wave amplitudes ranging from a l wl 0 005 to a l wl 0 015 details of simulation conditions are shown in table 11 numerical results include total resistance heave and pitch motions of catamaran models 5 2 heave and pitch motions figs 12 14 show the time histories of heave and pitch motions in regular head wave at λ l wl 1 00 2 50 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl respectively for bare hull model with flap1 l 80 mm and model with flap2 l 160 mm fig 12 gives the variation of heave and pitch motions of bare hull over time at different wave lengths it can be observed that the model moves smoothly when the wave length λ l wl 1 25 the amplitudes of both heave and pitch motions are limited and the periods are large at the range of 1 00 λ l wl 2 00 the amplitudes of ship motions increase and the periods decrease with the increase of wave length after λ l wl 2 00 amplitudes of ship motions turn to decrease with the increase of wave length but the periods still increase due to the increase of wave period figs 13 and 14 show the heave and pitch motions of models installed with stern flap1 and flap2 respectively when the stern flap is installed trends of ship motions with wave length are similar to the bare hull but the amplitudes are lower than the motions of bare hull at the range of 1 75 λ l wl 2 50 especially for the pitch motion time histories of heave and pitch motions for different models have been compared distinctly in fig 15 at λ l wl 2 00 a 0 01 l wl where the amplitudes of ship motions are relatively large the effect of stern flap for reducing ship motions is obvious but not significant for the period of ship motions for the study on the effect of stern flap for the seakeeping behavior of the catamaran model only fn 0 885 has been considered which is corresponding to the highest speed of this catamaran and makes more sense for the seakeeping characteristics time history results of heave and pitch motions are obtained from the hust ship cfd code and the motions could be approximated with fourier series expansions simonsen et al 2008 as 23 z t z 0 z 1 cos 2 π f e t γ z 1 z 2 cos 4 π f e t γ z 2 z 3 c o s 6 π f e t γ z 3 24 θ t θ 0 θ 1 cos 2 π f e t γ θ 1 θ 2 cos 4 π f e t γ θ 2 θ 3 c o s 6 π f e t γ θ 3 where z and θ represent the heave and pitch motions respectively z n and θ n are the nth order harmonic amplitude and γ z n and γ θ n are the nth order phase time histories have been processed by fft fast fourier transform in order to obtain the amplitudes of ship motions and the 1st harmonic is taken as the motion amplitude for example fig 16 shows the predicted ship motions time histories of the catamaran model bare hull in head wave λ 1 25l wl a 0 01l wl at fn 0 885 and fig 17 shows the results from fft analysis transfer functions are used to describe the heave and pitch motions as 25 t f 3 z 1 a 26 t f 5 θ 1 k a where tf 3 and tf 5 are the transfer functions for heave and pitch motions respectively z 1 and θ 1 are the 1st order harmonic amplitude a is the regular wave amplitude and k is the wave number which is defined as 27 k 2 π λ figs 18 and 19 show the numerical results of transfer functions of heave and pitch motions for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths as functions of both wave length λ l wl and encounter frequency f e at the highest speed fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl the encounter frequency f e is defined as 28 f e g 2 π λ v λ as can be seen from figs 18 and 19 for the bare hull model the heave and pitch transfer functions tf 3 and tf 5 increase with the increase of the wave length λ firstly corresponding to the decrease of the encounter frequency f e at the highest speed fn 0 885 and decrease at λ l wl 2 the peak of these have been found near the dimensionless wave length λ l wl 2 the encounter frequency f e 1 38 hz and it could be explained by the catamaran natural frequency the natural frequencies for heave and pitch could be obtained from the following formulations castiglione et al 2011 where the ship motions caused by wave are equivalent to a damping mass spring system 29 f z g c w p 8 π 2 c b t 30 f θ c i t g b 3 96 π 2 i 55 ˆ l w l 4 where c wp is the waterplane coefficient b is the beam overall c b is the block coefficient of the catamaran c it 12i t b 3 l wl is the coefficient of inertia of the waterplane area for y axis and i 55 ˆ i 55 ρl wl 5 is the dimensionless mass moment of inertia for y axis the natural frequencies for heave and pitch motions could be gained as f z 1 30 hz and f θ 1 31 hz as a result the maximum amplitudes of ship motions will occur at or near the resonance frequency 1 30 hz which is consistent with the trend of the curves in figs 18 and 19 irvine et al 2008 the effect of stern flap on the seakeeping behavior of the catamaran model could be observed from figs 18 and 19 fig 18 shows the transfer function of heave motion for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths as functions of both wave length λ l wl and encounter frequency f e at the highest speed fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl it can be observed that the effect of stern flap for the heave motion of the catamaran varied with the increase of wave length λ the decrease of encounter frequency f e as 1 0 λ l wl 2 0 1 35 hz f e 2 45 hz the transfer function of heave motion reduced when using stern flap and the reduction of heave motion increased with the increase of wave length λ the decrease of encounter frequency f e furthermore maximum reduction of the transfer function of heave motion occurred near the resonance frequency of the catamaran which indicated that the installation of the stern flap can effectively reduce the ship motion as the hull resonance occurred f e f z 1 30 hz fig 19 shows the transfer function of pitch motion for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths as functions of both wave length λ l wl and encounter frequency f e at the highest speed fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl the same trend could be found for the numerical results which indicated that the use of stern flap could reduce the pitch motion of the catamaran and the maximum reduction occurred near the hull resonance frequency f e f θ 1 30 hz moreover it could be found that heave motion of the catamaran model installed with flap 1 l 80 mm and flap 2 l 160 mm demonstrated a small difference the pitch motion of the catamaran model installed with flap 2 l 160 mm was relatively lower than the model with flap 1 l 80 mm 5 3 resistance the effect of stern flap for the resistance performance of the catamaran model has also been studied at the highest speed of model fn 0 885 figs 20 22 show the time histories of total resistance in regular head wave at λ l wl 1 00 2 50 fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl respectively for bare hull model with flap1 l 80 mm and model with flap2 l 160 mm fig 20 gives the variation of total resistance of bare hull over time at different wave lengths when compared with time histories of ship motions fig 12 it can be found that the relationship between wave resistance and ship motions in wave is closely linked the trends of wave resistance changing overtime at different wave lengths are consistent with ship motions when the wave length λ l wl 1 25 the fluctuation of wave resistance is limited with the increase of wave length 1 00 λ l wl 2 00 the fluctuation of wave resistance increases and the periods decrease after λ l wl 2 00 fluctuation of wave resistance decreases the time histories of total resistance for catamaran model with flap1 and flap2 are shown in figs 21 and 22 respectively comparison of total resistance for different models have been shown distinctly in fig 23 it can be observed that the resistance of model with stern flap is obviously lower than the resistance of bare hull which may be due to the reduction of ship motions using stern flap total resistance of different models in regular head waves could be derived as average values over time similar to the results of heave and pitch motions the numerical results of total resistance at time domain could approximated with fourier series expansions as 31 r t t r t 0 r t 1 cos 2 π f e t γ r t 1 r t 2 cos 4 π f e t γ r t 2 r t 3 c o s 6 π f e t γ r t 3 where r t represents value of total resistance r tn represents the nth order harmonic value and γ r t n are the nth order phase the 0th order harmonic value r t0 is equal to the average value of resistance over time time histories of total resistance of different models have been processed by fft fast fourier transform and the 0th harmonic value is taken as the average value of total resistance for example fig 24 shows the predicted ship resistance time history of the catamaran model bare hull in regular head wave λ 1 25l wl a 0 01l wl at fn 0 885 and fig 25 shows the results from fft analysis table 12 shows the resistance for different models at λ l wl 2 a l wl 0 01 operation condition the major contribution of stern flap is that it could reduce the residuary resistance wave resistance even the installation of the stern flap will increase the friction resistance on the other hand the length of the stern must be designed wisely respectively the operation speed and ocean condition should be considered to get the optimized length which will benefit the ship hydrodynamic performance fig 26 shows the total resistance coefficient for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths at fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl fig 26 a shows the total resistance coefficient as a function of wave length λ l wl and fig 26 b as a function of encounter frequency f e total resistance coefficient in waves for different sea states was derived as averaged values over time judging from the figures it is obvious that as the wave length λ increases the encounter frequency f e decreases the resistance of the bare hull increases first and then decreases rapidly at λ l wl 2 the maximum value of total resistance occurs near the resonance frequency of the catamaran model f z f θ 1 30 hz corresponding to the maximum value of the heave and pitch motions for the catamaran model after installing the stern flap the catamaran model demonstrates a better resistance performance with the increase of wave length λ the encounter frequency f e decreases the reduction of total resistance caused by using stern flap in head wave is observed increasing firstly and then decreasing at λ l wl 2 corresponding to the resonance frequency of the catamaran model f z f θ 1 30 hz the maximum resistance reduction could be found near the resonance frequency of the catamaran model f z f θ 1 30 hz and the reduction rate caused by stern flap 1 l 80 mm comparing with the bare hull is approximately 7 4 meanwhile it could be observed from fig 26 that the model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm demonstrates better resistance performance when comparing the model with stern flap 2 l 160 mm which is consistent with the resistance performance in calm water zhou et al 2019 the resistance reduction rates are respectively 7 4 and 5 1 for stern flap 1 l 80 mm and stern flap 2 l 160 mm when the dimensionless wave length λ l wl is 2 near the resonance frequency of catamaran model 5 4 stern flap effect on wave pattern fig 27 shows the wave pattern for different catamaran models with without stern flaps with different lengths in head wave λ 2 00 l wl a 0 01 l wl at fn 0 885 as can be seen obviously the head wave is coupled with the wave generated by the catamaran and the lanky kelvin wave system is obvious a hollow region is formed near the stern and then the flow converges behind the region to form the rooster tail for the model installed with stern flap the stern flap could increase effective ship length on the one hand thus increasing the area of hollow region on the other hand it could be found that the wave height is evidently reduced and the first wave crest behind the stern is removed which means that the wave energy losses of the flow field could be reduced using stern flap the height of rooster tail is also reduced indicating that the stern flap could effectively optimize the wave elevation generated by catamaran this phenomenon explains the reason about the resistance reduction caused by stern flap which is helpful to understand the effect of stern flap on the catamaran fig 28 and fig 29 respectively show the wave profiles at different longitudinal and transverse wave cuts for the flow field generated by different models the wave profiles could illustrate the effect of stern flap on the catamaran flow field behind stern intuitively fig 28 a shows wave profiles at the longitudinal centerline of the catamaran it can be found that the use of stern flap increases the length of hollow region behind stern and with the increase of flap length the hollow region increases even more meanwhile the wave height could be reduced at the first wave crest when using stern flaps the peak value of the first wave crest behind model with stern flap is only half of the peak value behind the bare hull in addition as shown in figs 28 and 29 the flow field behind the model with stern flap appears less steep than the flow field behind bare hull signifying that the installation of stern flap could reduce the wave energy loss 5 5 results in different wave amplitudes the effect of stern flap for catamaran model in head waves with different wave amplitudes has also been studied fig 30 shows the comparison of total resistance coefficient for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths in head waves λ l wl 2 at fn 0 885 as a function of the wave amplitude a l wl it can be observed that the resistance of the bare hull increases with the increase of wave amplitude a the reduction of total resistance caused by stern flap increases with the increase of wave amplitude a and the effect of flap 1 is better than the flap 2 6 conclusions this paper presents a systematic study on the effects of stern flap for the catamaran hydrodynamic performance in regular head waves different lengths of stern flaps were selected and the comparisons between the effects of different stern flaps were conducted an inhouse cfd code hust ship was used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the catamaran model experimental studies for several cases including the model advancing in calm water and head waves were conducted to validate the numerical method the results demonstrate that the resistance in calm water and the seakeeping behavior of the catamaran model could be predicted using inhouse cfd code hust ship which agree well with experimental data the effect of stern flap for heave and pitch motions of the catamaran model was more obvious near the resonance frequency of the catamaran model at which the maximum heave and pitch motions occurred the reduction of resistance was observed over the wave lengths ranging from λ l wl 1 to λ l wl 2 5 at fn 0 885 and wave amplitudes ranging from a l wl 0 005 to a l wl 0 015 the optimum resistance reduction occurred near the resonance frequency of the catamaran model and the resistance reduction increased with the increase of wave amplitude when the installing angle is decided the length ratio of the l stern flap l wl should not exit the 3 0 in this study case for fn 0 885 the stern flap could reduce the motions of the catamaran model on the wave for two length 80 mm and 160 mm according to the simulation results even the length of stern flap was double the improvement of see keeping characteristics shows little change on the other side the resistance reduction caused by stern flap 1 l 80 mm is better than the model with stern flap 2

hydrodynamic performance in different sea states experimental tests were performed to assess the accuracy of the cfd code validation of the numerical method was conducted for time steps grid independent studies and uncertainty analysis of the numerical simulation results includes evaluation of resistance and ship motions the comparisons of cfd and efd results agree well with each other then numerical studies on the stern flaps effect for the catamaran s hydrodynamic performance in regular head waves were presented different lengths of stern flaps have been considered the effects of stern flap on resistance heave and pitch motions were evaluated for different wave lengths and amplitudes the catamaran s resistance heave and pitch motions reached peak values near the resonance frequency of the catamaran models the results demonstrate that both the resistance and ship motions could be reduced when install the stern flap for the catamaran keywords catamaran stern flap cfd ship motion regular head wave seakeeping characteristic 1 introduction the catamaran is made up with two demi hulls in recent years catamarans have attracted growing attention and have been the relatively good choice for both civil transportation and naval vessels sahoo et al 2006 zhou et al 2014 as one of high speed ships catamaran can provide a relatively wide deck compared with mono hull deng and deng 2015 however a ship is often optimized on its rapidity in calm water when advancing in the sea the ship may provide a relatively poor seakeeping performance due to large vertical resonant motions castiglione et al 2011 the conventional catamaran is easily vulnerable from the deck diving in following seas lavroffa et al 2017 as a matter of fact it provoked the need about the optimization for hydrodynamic performance of the catamarans for the hydrodynamic optimization of the high speed ships some transom appendages installed behind the stern have been considered for playing a role in the improvement of resistance and seakeeping characteristic of ships several studies have been carried out for the use of these appendages karafiath and fisher 1987 gained the experimental and numerical results about the effect of stern wedges and stern flaps the results showed that full scale ship gained great powering reduction by using the stern wedges and stern flaps tsai and hwang 2004 conducted several experiments in order to research the effect of stern flap and interceptor for ship resistance reduction the experimental results indicated that the reduction of trim and resistance has been found for the high speed ships when installed the proper stern flap and interceptor karimi et al 2015 focused on the impact of controllable interceptors for the hydrodynamic performance of a planning craft both experimental and theoretical methods have been used for the research and a model of which the vertical motion could be controlled with interceptors both in calm water and head waves was used for the research using modern optimal control theory and savitsky s method the simulated results gained agreed well with the experimental data and both data showed that the controlled interceptors could be applied for reducing the resistance of the planning craft and heave and pitch motions especially near the resonant frequency mansoori et al 2017 investigated the effect of interceptor with different sizes and optimized the size of interceptors the research found that the interceptor could reduce the resistance and control sailing attitude of ship when the height of interceptor is less than 60 percent of boundary layer thickness at stern some other researches brizzolara 2003 day and cooper 2011 mansoori and fernandes 2015 also have been published which aimed to optimize the hydrodynamic performance of the high speed ships using such easily installed appendages many researches have been conducted for the effect of stern flaps the installation of stern flaps on ships began relatively early in the end of the 20th century the stern flap has been applied on large sized u s navy combatant judging from the experimental data the ship resistance could be prominently reduced when using the stern flap cusanelli and cave 1993 cusanelli and karafiath 2001 the reason of the effect caused by stern flap has been the focus of the research amacher et al 2015 presented a stern flap with optimized shape and assessed it by field tests the results showed that the reduction of wave energy have been caused using this flap ghadimi et al 2016 presented a stern flap with new shape and made a study on the effect of this stern flap using a 3d numerical analysis the results showed that this stern flap could influence the flow around the ship and reduce the wave resistance maki et al 2016 aimed to explain the reason of the resistance reduction caused by stern flaps and both experiment and numerical simulation have been conducted their results clarified that the installation of stern flaps could change the wave pattern behind the stern and then make an improvement on pressure distribution song et al 2018 conducted a systematic research of the effect of stern flaps and interceptors on hydrodynamic performance of a deep vee ship in calm water and the results showed that the proper combination of stern flap and interceptor could reduce the ship resistance and control sailing attitude effectively in calm water plenty of efforts have been focused on developing numerical methods for the prediction of catamaran seakeeping performance the motion characteristics for high speed wave piercing catamaran in waves were simulated by numerical method fang and chan 2004 the numerical results showed a good agreement with experimental data from sspa however lower error was found for the pitch motion when the encounter frequency was around the resonance region because of the nonlinear effects of center bow with large pitch motions in waves moraes et al 2004 used two methods to predict the wave resistance of the high speed catamaran and the effects of hull spacing were studied the results showed that the elevation of the wave resistance coefficient curve becomes greater with the decrease of the spacing when froude number is around 0 5 castiglione et al 2011 applied an urans code for the numerical simulation of the seakeeping behavior of a catamaran and the numerical results were compared well with the experimental data the study showed that the accuracy of simulation results using urans method is higher than the strip theory solutions and nonlinear effects could be considered using urans method they also found that the maximum of ship motions occurred near the resonance frequency and the maximum value of pitch motion occurred lower than resonance frequency bouscasse et al 2013 investigated the seakeeping performance of a catamaran in transient regular and irregular head waves they conducted repeatability analysis in order to certify the experimental data and it has been proved as a valuable database for the research of hydrodynamic performance of catamarans fitriadhy et al 2018 aimed to research the seakeeping performance of one deep v high speed catamaran with cfd method and the effect of different froude number wave length and wave height for heave and pitch motions of catamaran have been studied this paper presents a numerical study of seakeeping characteristics for a catamaran with stern flap advancing in regular head wave an inhouse cfd code hust ship was used to predict the resistance and motion of the catamaran in wave with without stern flap experimental studies were conducted to validate the numerical method uncertainty analysis of numerical method had been performed to minimize the numerical error of the cfd code the effects of stern flap with different lengths on the catamaran seakeeping characteristics in regular head wave has been studied for different wave lengths and amplitudes spectra analysis of the unsteady motion of catamaran on wave condition was performed for comparisons comparisons between the bare hull model and model with different stern flaps show that stern flaps could improve the resistance and seakeeping performance of catamaran in regular head wave 2 objective of study 2 1 catamaran model a catamaran model was selected as the object of the study including numerical simulation and experimental test the model is made up by two symmetrical demi hulls with a sharp bow and a transom stern fig 1 shows the geometry of the catamaran model with stern flap and table 1 shows the main parameters of catamaran model 2 2 geometry of stern flap table 2 shows the values of specific parameters of different stern flaps selected for this study fig 2 shows the geometry of the stern flap since the installation of stern flap could lead to the increase of wetted surface area of catamaran which would increase the ship friction resistance the lengths of stern flaps l are 80 mm and 160 mm corresponding to 3 and 6 of the ship length at waterline in this study the span is taken across the transom and the installation angle of different stern flap is constant the bare hull without stern flap has also been considered in the study to understand the effect of stern flap on the catamaran model 3

cartesian coordinate systems are employed to describe the ship motions including an absolute inertial earth fixed coordinate system and a relative non inertial ship fixed coordinate system as shown in fig 3 positive x y and z represent aft starboard and upward direction respectively in the cartesian earth fixed and ship fixed coordinate system ship fixed coordinate system moves with the motions of ship and its origin o is always fixed at the center of gravity of the ship 3 2 numerical towing tank and boundary conditions the numerical tank dimensions were set to 1 0 x l wl 4 0 1 0 y l wl 1 0 and 1 0 z l wl 1 0 for the catamaran model advancing in regular head waves which is depicted in fig 4 the ship length is on the x axis with the bow at x 0 and the stern at x 1l wl the free surface is at z 0 the boundary conditions are described in fig 4 the velocity inlet boundary condition is applied on the front end of the numerical tank the pressure outlet boundary condition is applied on the exit the zero pressure boundary condition is applied on the bottom zero pressure gradient boundary conditions are applied on two sides and top no slip boundary conditions are applied on the surfaces of the catamaran hull 3 3 wave generating method linear regular wave theory is used to simulate regular waves by wave length and wave amplitude of incident wave regular wave can be generated by defining the boundary condition of numerical tank the free surface position at the inlet of numerical tank is set as 9 η t a c o s k x ω t φ the velocity components at the inlet are set as 10 u a ω cosh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t φ 11 w a ω sinh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t φ 3 4 damping method damping method is used for the wave elevation the expression of the momentum equation after modification is 12 u t u u x

with damping method 14 μ x a s x x 0 l s x x 0 0 x x 0 where x0 represents position which wave begins to be absorbed l s is the total length of the damping layer and as is the wave extinction strength coefficient in this simulation wave damping range is 3 0 x l wl 4 0 and as 2 3 5 numerical wave tank numerical regular wave tank was developed for catamaran seakeeping characteristic studies in order to evaluate the accuracy of numerical wave tank a point in front of the ship was selected to monitor the change of wave elevation over time the comparison between cfd simulation results for the regular head wave λ l wl 1 15 a l wl 0 10 and the corresponding theoretical wave amplitude curve is shown in fig 5 as can be seen the regular wave generated by the numerical wave tank is satisfactory 3 6 overset grid technology the idea of overset grids arose from the need to model multicomponent systems where an optimum body fitted grid is used for each component by allowing arbitrary overlap between neighboring grids each grid in an overset system can be generated independently from one another where the sole focus can be on maintaining high grid cell quality such as orthogonality and clustering this flexibility typically results in significantly better grid quality compared to the tightly constrained abutting grid approach where grid points on the boundaries of neighboring grids are required to coincide with each other exactly moreover the overset approach allows local modifications to the geometry such as addition or removal of a component without the need to regenerate the entire grid system boger and dreyer 2006 chan 2009 the structured overset grid technology used in this study is almost same as the scheme of the reference boger and dreyer 2006 chan 2009 for the grid generation the total grid consists of two part grids as depicted in fig 6 one is hull grid and the other is numerical tank for the hull the grid on the boundary layer are small enough y 1 in order to capture the boundary layer several refinements have been created around the bow and stern of catamaran where the flow is relatively complex in the numerical tank the grid at the free surface is refined to capture the wave pattern accurately for the numerical simulation of the model in head waves the numerical tank needs to be refined including at least 50 grid points per wavelength and 20 grid points per wave height based on ittc recommendation the hull grid is embedded in the numerical tank using overset grid technology the grid nodes inside the hull grid are removed but several layers of oversetting nodes are remained these remaining nodes are prepared for interpolation which is used to exchange each grid data at the boundary of the oversetting region to complete the calculation of the entire flow field as depicted in fig 6 4 verification and validation estimation of the numerical modelling errors using asme v v 2009 validation procedure the american society of mechanical engineers 2009 2016 requires experimental data and its uncertainties numerical simulations and its uncertainties and input parameter uncertainties the input parameters uncertainty is assumed to be zero the experiment tests including resistance tests in calm water and regular wave have been carried out for the catamaran model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm in order to validate the numerical method verification and validation works have been conducted for the catamaran model advancing in calm water and regular head wave at fn 0 885 4 1 verification of cfd code 4 1 1 resistance in calm water systematic grid convergence study time convergence study and iterative convergence study have been carried out according to the method stern et al 2001 xing and stern 2010 according to this method the convergence factor r was defined as 15 r s f s m s m s c when 0 r 1 monotonic convergence is achieved and richardson extrapolation method was used the estimated order of accuracy p re was calculated as 16 p r e ln s m s c s f s m ln r a distance metric p to the asymptotic range is used defined as the ratio of p re to p th the factor of safety method uncertainty is given as 17 u f s 2 45 0 85 p s f s m r p r e 1 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 s f s m r p r e 1 p 1 for the grid convergence verification three different grids were generated with the grid refinement ratio r g 2 corresponding to coarse 1 45 million grid points medium 4 09 million grid points and fine 11 5 million grid points the grid convergence study was based on the medium time step and the results simulated by the coarse medium and fine grids were signed as s gc s gm and s gf respectively shown in table 3 three time steps were used with the refinement ratio r t 2 corresponding to coarse δt 0 0071 medium δt 0 005 and fine δt 0 0035 the time step convergence study was based on the medium grid and the results simulated for three time steps were signed as s tc s tm and s tf shown in table 4 iterative convergence study was conducted on the medium grid and medium time step and the errors were at least one order of magnitude smaller than the grid and time step errors from tables 3 and 4 thus the iterative errors could be neglected results of grid and time step convergence studies for the resistance of the catamaran model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm advancing in calm water at highest speed fn 0 885 were summarized in table 5 for both grid and time step the convergence factor r was between 0 and 1 which meant that the monotonic convergence was achieved and then the factor of safety method could be used to calculate the numerical uncertainties from the table 5 it can be observed that the uncertainties of grid and time step were 0 88 s gf and 0 36 s tf respectively as can be seen u g values are obviously higher than u t which indicates that the grid errors are the major source of the numerical uncertainty what s more the grid and time step convergence was achieved satisfactorily 4 1 2 unsteady motions of the catamaran in regular head wave the same method has been used for the verification study of unsteady motions of the model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm in regular head wave including heave and pitch motions the wave condition where the amplitudes of ship motions are relatively large were chosen for the verification study fn 0 885 λ l wl 2 a l wl 0 0129 i yy l wl 0 35 the verification parameters are the transfer functions tf 3 and tf 5 of heave and pitch motions three different grids were generated with the grid refinement ratio r g 2 corresponding to coarse 3 09 million grid points medium 4 77 million grid points and fine 9 50 million grid points three time steps were also used with the refinement ratio r t 2 corresponding to coarse δt 0 0071 medium δt 0 0050 and fine δt 0 0035 for both grid and time step the convergence factor r was between 0 and 1 indicating that the monotonic convergence was achieved and the factor of safety method could be used to obtain the uncertainties the results of grid and time step convergence study were shown in table 6 and the verification results were shown in table 7 overall verification results demonstrate good convergence performance for both grid and time step as a result the medium grid and medium time step were selected for the next numerical study 4 2 validation of the cfd code validation of numerical method is used to assess the simulation modeling uncertainty u d using the experimental data for the validation study the results from numerical simulations were compared to the experimental data the validation uncertainty u v is calculated as 18 u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 where u d is the experimental uncertainty and u sn is the numerical uncertainty which is calculated as 19 u s n 2 u g 2 u t 2 u i 2 where u g is the uncertainty from grid convergence study u t is the uncertainty from time step convergence study and u i is the iterative uncertainty which could be neglected the comparison error e is defined as 20 e d s where d is the experimental data and s is the result from numerical simulation the experimental tests of the catamaran model were conducted at the laboratory of ship model towing tank of naval architecture ocean engineering college of huazhong university of science and technology which is 175 m long 6 m wide and 4 m deep the catamaran model installed with stern flap 1 l 80 mm was considered as the object of experimental tests experimental data for the catamaran model advancing in calm water includes ship resistance over a speed range between fn 0 537 to fn 0 885 fn is the froude number and defined as 21 f n v g l w l where v is the sailing speed of ship g is the acceleration due to gravity and l wl is ship length at waterline the experiments aimed to validate the reliability of numerical method used in this study fig 7 shows the model in experimental tests the experimental data in regular head wave includes time histories of catamaran s motion for different wave lengths ranging from λ lwl 1 to λ lwl 2 with corresponding wave amplitudes at fn 0 885 the details of test conditions are shown in table 8 and numerical simulations have been carried out for the same conditions in order to compare the numerical results with the experimental data and then validate the numerical method in the experiment tests the dimensionless longitudinal radius of inertia i yy l wl was 0 35 4 2 1 resistance in calm water the results of validation study about model resistance in calm water are shown in table 9 the validation study shows that the comparison error e is lower than the validation uncertainty u v which indicates that the simulation results are validated under the u v level fig 8 shows the comparison between cfd simulation results and the experimental data for total resistance of the catamaran model installed with stern flap 1 l 80 mm at different speeds the total resistance coefficient is defined as 22 c t r t 0 5 ρ v 2 s where r t is the total resistance s is wetted surface area of the hull model and v is the sailing velocity of model as shown in fig 8 the results of total resistance from hust ship cfd code agree well with the experimental data for all speeds fig 9 shows the wave pattern of the free surface for the catamaran model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm advancing in calm water at different values of fn simulated by hust ship cfd code the wave pattern around the model in calm water is helpful to analyze the ship resistance as can be observed in fig 9 the kelvin wave pattern is evident obvious wave crest is formed at the bow and obvious wave though behind the stern it could be also observed that higher wave crest is formed between two demi hulls and the wave crest region becomes longer with the increase of fn which is caused by the interference effects between the wave systems of two demi hulls with the increase of fn the wave making region behind the stern becomes lankier and the major wave trough and crest move far away from the stern 4 2 2 unsteady motion of the catamaran in regular head wave seakeeping experimental tests for several conditions have been conducted in order to validate the numerical method table 10 shows the results of validation study about model s unsteady motion in regular head wave the results show that the comparison error e of ship pitch motion is lower than the validation uncertainty u v which indicates that the simulation results are validated under the u v level three wave lengths λ 1l wl 1 5l wl and λ 2l wl have been selected for regular head wave tests at one speed fn 0 885 fig 10 and fig 11 show the comparison between numerical simulation results from hust ship and experimental data including the time history amplitude and period of pitch motion of model it can be observed that the numerical results from hust ship show a good agreement with the experimental data 5 results and discussion 5 1 simulation conditions the numerical simulations are conducted in regular head waves for models with without different stern flaps including bare hull hull with flap 1 and hull with flap 2 simulations are carried out at different wave lengths and amplitudes at a relatively high speed of the model fn 0 885 wave lengths ranging from λ l wl 1 to λ l wl 2 5 at fn 0 885 and wave amplitudes ranging from a l wl 0 005 to a l wl 0 015 details of simulation conditions are shown in table 11 numerical results include total resistance heave and pitch motions of catamaran models 5 2 heave and pitch motions figs 12 14 show the time histories of heave and pitch motions in regular head wave at λ l wl 1 00 2 50 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl respectively for bare hull model with flap1 l 80 mm and model with flap2 l 160 mm fig 12 gives the variation of heave and pitch motions of bare hull over time at different wave lengths it can be observed that the model moves smoothly when the wave length λ l wl 1 25 the amplitudes of both heave and pitch motions are limited and the periods are large at the range of 1 00 λ l wl 2 00 the amplitudes of ship motions increase and the periods decrease with the increase of wave length after λ l wl 2 00 amplitudes of ship motions turn to decrease with the increase of wave length but the periods still increase due to the increase of wave period figs 13 and 14 show the heave and pitch motions of models installed with stern flap1 and flap2 respectively when the stern flap is installed trends of ship motions with wave length are similar to the bare hull but the amplitudes are lower than the motions of bare hull at the range of 1 75 λ l wl 2 50 especially for the pitch motion time histories of heave and pitch motions for different models have been compared distinctly in fig 15 at λ l wl 2 00 a 0 01 l wl where the amplitudes of ship motions are relatively large the effect of stern flap for reducing ship motions is obvious but not significant for the period of ship motions for the study on the effect of stern flap for the seakeeping behavior of the catamaran model only fn 0 885 has been considered which is corresponding to the highest speed of this catamaran and makes more sense for the seakeeping characteristics time history results of heave and pitch motions are obtained from the hust ship cfd code and the motions could be approximated with fourier series expansions simonsen et al 2008 as 23 z t z 0 z 1 cos 2 π f e t γ z 1 z 2 cos 4 π f e t γ z 2 z 3 c o s 6 π f e t γ z 3 24 θ t θ 0 θ 1 cos 2 π f e t γ θ 1 θ 2 cos 4 π f e t γ θ 2 θ 3 c o s 6 π f e t γ θ 3 where z and θ represent the heave and pitch motions respectively z n and θ n are the nth order harmonic amplitude and γ z n and γ θ n are the nth order phase time histories have been processed by fft fast fourier transform in order to obtain the amplitudes of ship motions and the 1st harmonic is taken as the motion amplitude for example fig 16 shows the predicted ship motions time histories of the catamaran model bare hull in head wave λ 1 25l wl a 0 01l wl at fn 0 885 and fig 17 shows the results from fft analysis transfer functions are used to describe the heave and pitch motions as 25 t f 3 z 1 a 26 t f 5 θ 1 k a where tf 3 and tf 5 are the transfer functions for heave and pitch motions respectively z 1 and θ 1 are the 1st order harmonic amplitude a is the regular wave amplitude and k is the wave number which is defined as 27 k 2 π λ figs 18 and 19 show the numerical results of transfer functions of heave and pitch motions for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths as functions of both wave length λ l wl and encounter frequency f e at the highest speed fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl the encounter frequency f e is defined as 28 f e g 2 π λ v λ as can be seen from figs 18 and 19 for the bare hull model the heave and pitch transfer functions tf 3 and tf 5 increase with the increase of the wave length λ firstly corresponding to the decrease of the encounter frequency f e at the highest speed fn 0 885 and decrease at λ l wl 2 the peak of these have been found near the dimensionless wave length λ l wl 2 the encounter frequency f e 1 38 hz and it could be explained by the catamaran natural frequency the natural frequencies for heave and pitch could be obtained from the following formulations castiglione et al 2011 where the ship motions caused by wave are equivalent to a damping mass spring system 29 f z g c w p 8 π 2 c b t 30 f θ c i t g b 3 96 π 2 i 55 ˆ l w l 4 where c wp is the waterplane coefficient b is the beam overall c b is the block coefficient of the catamaran c it 12i t b 3 l wl is the coefficient of inertia of the waterplane area for y axis and i 55 ˆ i 55 ρl wl 5 is the dimensionless mass moment of inertia for y axis the natural frequencies for heave and pitch motions could be gained as f z 1 30 hz and f θ 1 31 hz as a result the maximum amplitudes of ship motions will occur at or near the resonance frequency 1 30 hz which is consistent with the trend of the curves in figs 18 and 19 irvine et al 2008 the effect of stern flap on the seakeeping behavior of the catamaran model could be observed from figs 18 and 19 fig 18 shows the transfer function of heave motion for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths as functions of both wave length λ l wl and encounter frequency f e at the highest speed fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl it can be observed that the effect of stern flap for the heave motion of the catamaran varied with the increase of wave length λ the decrease of encounter frequency f e as 1 0 λ l wl 2 0 1 35 hz f e 2 45 hz the transfer function of heave motion reduced when using stern flap and the reduction of heave motion increased with the increase of wave length λ the decrease of encounter frequency f e furthermore maximum reduction of the transfer function of heave motion occurred near the resonance frequency of the catamaran which indicated that the installation of the stern flap can effectively reduce the ship motion as the hull resonance occurred f e f z 1 30 hz fig 19 shows the transfer function of pitch motion for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths as functions of both wave length λ l wl and encounter frequency f e at the highest speed fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl the same trend could be found for the numerical results which indicated that the use of stern flap could reduce the pitch motion of the catamaran and the maximum reduction occurred near the hull resonance frequency f e f θ 1 30 hz moreover it could be found that heave motion of the catamaran model installed with flap 1 l 80 mm and flap 2 l 160 mm demonstrated a small difference the pitch motion of the catamaran model installed with flap 2 l 160 mm was relatively lower than the model with flap 1 l 80 mm 5 3 resistance the effect of stern flap for the resistance performance of the catamaran model has also been studied at the highest speed of model fn 0 885 figs 20 22 show the time histories of total resistance in regular head wave at λ l wl 1 00 2 50 fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl respectively for bare hull model with flap1 l 80 mm and model with flap2 l 160 mm fig 20 gives the variation of total resistance of bare hull over time at different wave lengths when compared with time histories of ship motions fig 12 it can be found that the relationship between wave resistance and ship motions in wave is closely linked the trends of wave resistance changing overtime at different wave lengths are consistent with ship motions when the wave length λ l wl 1 25 the fluctuation of wave resistance is limited with the increase of wave length 1 00 λ l wl 2 00 the fluctuation of wave resistance increases and the periods decrease after λ l wl 2 00 fluctuation of wave resistance decreases the time histories of total resistance for catamaran model with flap1 and flap2 are shown in figs 21 and 22 respectively comparison of total resistance for different models have been shown distinctly in fig 23 it can be observed that the resistance of model with stern flap is obviously lower than the resistance of bare hull which may be due to the reduction of ship motions using stern flap total resistance of different models in regular head waves could be derived as average values over time similar to the results of heave and pitch motions the numerical results of total resistance at time domain could approximated with fourier series expansions as 31 r t t r t 0 r t 1 cos 2 π f e t γ r t 1 r t 2 cos 4 π f e t γ r t 2 r t 3 c o s 6 π f e t γ r t 3 where r t represents value of total resistance r tn represents the nth order harmonic value and γ r t n are the nth order phase the 0th order harmonic value r t0 is equal to the average value of resistance over time time histories of total resistance of different models have been processed by fft fast fourier transform and the 0th harmonic value is taken as the average value of total resistance for example fig 24 shows the predicted ship resistance time history of the catamaran model bare hull in regular head wave λ 1 25l wl a 0 01l wl at fn 0 885 and fig 25 shows the results from fft analysis table 12 shows the resistance for different models at λ l wl 2 a l wl 0 01 operation condition the major contribution of stern flap is that it could reduce the residuary resistance wave resistance even the installation of the stern flap will increase the friction resistance on the other hand the length of the stern must be designed wisely respectively the operation speed and ocean condition should be considered to get the optimized length which will benefit the ship hydrodynamic performance fig 26 shows the total resistance coefficient for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths at fn 0 885 with constant wave amplitude a 0 01 l wl fig 26 a shows the total resistance coefficient as a function of wave length λ l wl and fig 26 b as a function of encounter frequency f e total resistance coefficient in waves for different sea states was derived as averaged values over time judging from the figures it is obvious that as the wave length λ increases the encounter frequency f e decreases the resistance of the bare hull increases first and then decreases rapidly at λ l wl 2 the maximum value of total resistance occurs near the resonance frequency of the catamaran model f z f θ 1 30 hz corresponding to the maximum value of the heave and pitch motions for the catamaran model after installing the stern flap the catamaran model demonstrates a better resistance performance with the increase of wave length λ the encounter frequency f e decreases the reduction of total resistance caused by using stern flap in head wave is observed increasing firstly and then decreasing at λ l wl 2 corresponding to the resonance frequency of the catamaran model f z f θ 1 30 hz the maximum resistance reduction could be found near the resonance frequency of the catamaran model f z f θ 1 30 hz and the reduction rate caused by stern flap 1 l 80 mm comparing with the bare hull is approximately 7 4 meanwhile it could be observed from fig 26 that the model with stern flap 1 l 80 mm demonstrates better resistance performance when comparing the model with stern flap 2 l 160 mm which is consistent with the resistance performance in calm water zhou et al 2019 the resistance reduction rates are respectively 7 4 and 5 1 for stern flap 1 l 80 mm and stern flap 2 l 160 mm when the dimensionless wave length λ l wl is 2 near the resonance frequency of catamaran model 5 4 stern flap effect on wave pattern fig 27 shows the wave pattern for different catamaran models with without stern flaps with different lengths in head wave λ 2 00 l wl a 0 01 l wl at fn 0 885 as can be seen obviously the head wave is coupled with the wave generated by the catamaran and the lanky kelvin wave system is obvious a hollow region is formed near the stern and then the flow converges behind the region to form the rooster tail for the model installed with stern flap the stern flap could increase effective ship length on the one hand thus increasing the area of hollow region on the other hand it could be found that the wave height is evidently reduced and the first wave crest behind the stern is removed which means that the wave energy losses of the flow field could be reduced using stern flap the height of rooster tail is also reduced indicating that the stern flap could effectively optimize the wave elevation generated by catamaran this phenomenon explains the reason about the resistance reduction caused by stern flap which is helpful to understand the effect of stern flap on the catamaran fig 28 and fig 29 respectively show the wave profiles at different longitudinal and transverse wave cuts for the flow field generated by different models the wave profiles could illustrate the effect of stern flap on the catamaran flow field behind stern intuitively fig 28 a shows wave profiles at the longitudinal centerline of the catamaran it can be found that the use of stern flap increases the length of hollow region behind stern and with the increase of flap length the hollow region increases even more meanwhile the wave height could be reduced at the first wave crest when using stern flaps the peak value of the first wave crest behind model with stern flap is only half of the peak value behind the bare hull in addition as shown in figs 28 and 29 the flow field behind the model with stern flap appears less steep than the flow field behind bare hull signifying that the installation of stern flap could reduce the wave energy loss 5 5 results in different wave amplitudes the effect of stern flap for catamaran model in head waves with different wave amplitudes has also been studied fig 30 shows the comparison of total resistance coefficient for different models with without stern flaps with different lengths in head waves λ l wl 2 at fn 0 885 as a function of the wave amplitude a l wl it can be observed that the resistance of the bare hull increases with the increase of wave amplitude a the reduction of total resistance caused by stern flap increases with the increase of wave amplitude a and the effect of flap 1 is better than the flap 2 6 conclusions this paper presents a systematic study on the effects of stern flap for the catamaran hydrodynamic performance in regular head waves different lengths of stern flaps were selected and the comparisons between the effects of different stern flaps were conducted an inhouse cfd code hust ship was used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the catamaran model experimental studies for several cases including the model advancing in calm water and head waves were conducted to validate the numerical method the results demonstrate that the resistance in calm water and the seakeeping behavior of the catamaran model could be predicted using inhouse cfd code hust ship which agree well with experimental data the effect of stern flap for heave and pitch motions of the catamaran model was more obvious near the resonance frequency of the catamaran model at which the maximum heave and pitch motions occurred the reduction of resistance was observed over the wave lengths ranging from λ l wl 1 to λ l wl 2 5 at fn 0 885 and wave amplitudes ranging from a l wl 0 005 to a l wl 0 015 the optimum resistance reduction occurred near the resonance frequency of the catamaran model and the resistance reduction increased with the increase of wave amplitude when the installing angle is decided the length ratio of the l stern flap l wl should not exit the 3 0 in this study case for fn 0 885 the stern flap could reduce the motions of the catamaran model on the wave for two length 80 mm and 160 mm according to the simulation results even the length of stern flap was double the improvement of see keeping characteristics shows little change on the other side the resistance reduction caused by stern flap 1 l 80 mm is better than the model with stern flap 2

21858,to apply the p y curve method in laterally loaded pile analyses three dimensional effects in component such as the ultimate pile bearing capacity pile compatibility factor and initial subgrade modulus must be incorporated a framework to consider these factors in the theoretical p y curve derived by the total displacement loading extended mobilisable strength design t emsd approach is presented the bearing capacity design equation can be used to estimate the continuous velocity fields based pile compatibility factor profile to verify the pile bearing capacity design equation fitted from an upper bound solution centrifuge experiments of rigidly translated piles were performed corresponding finite element analyses were also performed the pile compatibility factor profile was obtained through the verified bearing capacity equation and experimental results finally the applications of plane strain p y curves to three dimensional problems were demonstrated via experiment simulation and parametric study keywords laterally loaded pile ultimate bearing capacity factor compatibility factor p y curve centrifuge experiment 1 introduction in offshore engineering pile foundations are often designed to sustain lateral load such as wind and wave both the deformation control at serviceability limit state sls and lateral load at ultimate limit state uls are important guidance for pile design available pile design methods include elasto plastic numerical methods elastic continuum methods and subgrade reaction methods although elasto plastic finite element fe method can provide both sls bransby 1999 jeanjean 2009 and uls zhang et al 2016b truong and lehane 2017 for laterally loaded piles expertise concerning the analysis parameter setting property choice and even soil constitutive model implementation is required to guarantee the rationality of fe analysis based on the mindlin s solution the elastic continuum method baguelin et al 1977 banerjee and davies 1978 poulos and davis 1980 kitiyodom and matsumoto 2003 zhang et al 2016a cannot be extended to analyze the nonlinear behavior of laterally loaded piles accordingly the application of the elastic continuum method is confined in sls design in the subgrade reaction method the soil surrounding the pile is represented by a series of discrete horizontal springs whose responses are independent of others the reaction deformation relationship of the discrete springs can be taken linear guo and lee 2001 hirai 2012 zhang et al 2016a or nonlinear matlock 1970 reese et al 1975 nogami et al 1992 georgiadis et al 1992 bransby 1999 klar 2008 zhang and ahmari 2013 byrne et al 2017 which is also termed as the p y curve model as the p y curve method can conveniently take nonlinear behavior and non homogeneity property of soil into account it has been extensively applied to the analyses of lateral loaded piles available p y curves were primarily based on empirical curve fitted from laboratory or centrifuge model tests matlock 1970 yan and byrne 1992 dyson and randolph 1997 jeanjean 2009 hong et al 2017 or finite element results bransby 1999 templeton 2009 truong and lehane 2017 in which the definition proposed by matlock 1970 and recommended by american petroleum institute api are widely adopted in practice to demonstrate the essential components involving p y curve construction the p y curve by matlock 1970 for laterally loaded pile in soft clay is given as follows 1 p 0 5 p u y y c 1 3 where y c 2 5 ε 50 d is the critical lateral displacement with ε 50 representing the axial strain under one half of maximum deviatoric stress in laboratory undrained compression tests on undisturbed clay samples and d is pile diameter p u n p d s u is the ultimate lateral load per unit depth n p is the ultimate bearing capacity factor and s u is the undrained shear strength of clay the n p definition of api approach is 2 n p z 3 j z d γ z s u z z r 9 z z r where z is the depth below mudline γ is the effective unit weight of clay j is a dimensionless empirical constant ranging from 0 25 to 0 5 with 0 25 for soft clay and 0 5 for stiff clay z r 6 d γ d s u j is the transition depth from the matlock formula two essential components of p y curve are identified one is the backbone curve of eq 1 that describes the nonlinear evolution of subgrade reaction modulus k h p y the other is the profile of ultimate bearing capacity given in eq 2 the laboratory stress strain curve is implicitly represented by a controlling point in eq 1 thereby considering the soil property to better understand the mechanism of pile soil interaction substantial effort has been made to either establish the theoretical basis for ultimate bearing capacity factor or construct backbone curve that considers the soil stress strain relation in proper way in terms of uls randolph and houlsby 1984 obtained the limiting lateral pressure on a plane strain circular pile by the limit analysis method and the most accurate analytical upper bound solutions of the same problem were provided by martin and randolph 2006 by combining the shallow wedge mechanism and the deep full flow mechanism such as that proposed by randolph and houlsby 1984 murff and hamilton 1993 constructed a three dimensional velocity field for laterally load pile and conducted upper bound limit analysis by modifying the shape function for the shallow wedge of the combined mechanism yu et al 2015 improved the upper bound n p profile of murff and hamilton 1993 yu et al 2017a further proposed a shallow wedge mechanism that considered the progressive rotation of a rigid pile whose upper bound solutions agreed well with the centrifuge experiment results at the large rotation angles a continuous three dimensional upper bound velocity field was also constructed by klar and randolph 2008 for flexible piles klar 2008 applied the msd approach osman and bolton 2005 to generate p y curve by scaling from soil stress strain curve the scaling factors were analytically derived from a continuous mechanism by upper bound analysis for stress load factor and deformation compatibility for strain displacement factor klar and osman 2008 further improved the accuracy of such stress strain curve based p y curve by the emsd approach with incremental steps where the velocity field could evolve but the simplicity of constant scaling factors is lost yu et al 2017b presented a new t emsd approach to construct continuous mechanism by elastic iteration and applied the method in generating p y curve following klar 2008 similarly the p y curves presented by zhang and andersen 2017 were also scaled from laboratory stress strain curve with scale factor calibrated by fe results although the analytical p y curve proposed by klar 2008 and yu et al 2017b is derived from the plane strain continuous mechanism three dimensional effect can be taking into account through the ultimate bearing capacity factor compatibility factor and initial subgrade modulus the compatibility factor defines the relationship between the pile section displacement and the average strain surrounding the pile push over results of fixed head rigid piles zhang et al 2010 murali et al 2015 can be used to verify the upper bound n p profile however the available tests were exclusively conducted for short rigid pile with l d 5 where l is the pile buried depth accordingly centrifuge experiment of long rigid pile is designed and performed in the present study to bridge the gap the variation pattern of compatibility factor with depth was also investigated based on the test results besides the present analytical p y curve is applied to simulate centrifuge tests and analysis example 2 consideration of three dimensional effects in t emsd based p y curves although the laterally loaded piles are typical three dimensional problem the p y curves are derived from the plane strain analysis model thus three dimensional effects should be incorporated in the p y curves such three dimensional effects can be separated into three categories namely the ultimate bearing capacity factor n p compatibility factor m c and initial subgrade modulus k i n i the parameter n p defines the relationship between the pile lateral limiting bearing pressure p u and the undrained shear strength s u the parameter m c defines the relationship between the pile section displacement y d and the average strain ε s a v e within the fully mobilized nonlinear zone surrounding the pile which is independent of the elastic region the parameter k i n i defines the elastic response of the pile soil system as shown in fig 1 the values of n p m c and k i n i would vary with depth reflecting the three dimensional pile soil interaction and the scaling relationship between the stress strain curve and the p y backbone curve is derived from the plane strain analysis model ideally the p y backbone curve should contain n p m c and k i n i so that the three dimensional effects could be naturally taken into account in the case of the api p y curve formulation only n p is contained in the p y backbone formula accordingly only three dimensional n p expression is suggested although k ini is not explicitly expressed in the api approach derivation of the p y relationship leads to an infinite value for k ini which has no particular physical meaning in practice secant stiffness is used for the api p y method instead of tangent stiffness to avoid the treatment of infinity comparing the definition of m c given by ε s a v 2 ε max dv dv m c y d r 0 and the api formulation to link soil strain with pile section displacement by y c 2 5 ε 50 d where r 0 d 2 is the pile radius some similarity between them is identified suppose ε 50 and y c are equivalent of ε s a v and y d respectively y c 2 5 ε 50 d could be rewritten as ε s a v 1 5 y d r 0 resulting in m c 0 2 since the expression of y c is irrelevant to depth constant m c is adopted in the api p y curve the parameter k i n i is not expressed explicitly in the api p y curve after reviewing the api p y curve let us focus on the analytical p y curve proposed by klar 2008 and yu et al 2017b which is theoretically derived from a plane strain pile soil bearing mechanism with the soil stress strain curve taken into account the analytical p y is given as 3 p n p r 0 s u 1 5 m c a r 0 s u 0 5 a e y n p r 0 s u 1 5 m c a r 0 s u 0 5 a e y 2 2 a e n p r 0 s u y where e is the young s modulus of soil in the plane strain analytical model the soil is separated into an outer linear zone and an inner nonlinear zone by a rigid ring to avoid unrealistic overestimation of the initial subgrade modulus the radius of the ring is determined by the optimal mechanism whose effect is reflected in m c and a e defines the linear stiffness of the ring relative to the out linear zone by derivation of eq 3 the initial subgrade modulus defined by the p y curve can be written as 4 d p d y y 0 a e m c n p m c n p 1 5 a as the lateral pile stiffness derived from plane strain elastic model is boundary dependent three dimensional solution should be used instead baguelin et al 1977 klar 2008 thereby linking a e with k i n i accordingly k i n i d p d y leads to non dimensional coefficient a m c n p k i n i m c n p e 1 5 k i n i since n p m c and k i n i are contained in the theoretical p y curve three dimensional effects can be easily taken into account demonstrating the merits of the theoretically derived p y curve over the api formulation the n p expression of yu et al 2015 using the upper bound limit analysis and the k i n i expression of zhang et al 2016a by comparing the solution of the elastic continuum method and that of the linear subgrade reaction method are adopted in the present study 5 k i n i h 7 5 η h 1 v 2 3 4 v e 1 v 2 e d 4 e p i p 12 k r 10 2 7 5 η h 1 v 2 3 4 v e 1 v 2 100 d l 4 12 k r 10 2 where k r e p i p e l 4 is the relative pile soil rigidity factor defined by poulos and davis 1980 e p i p is the pile flexural rigidity and h stands for the depth under consideration as z is used as an integral variable in factor η h 6 η h 1 v e l 2 1 v 6 8 v ln l

h z 2 r 2 b 2 h z 2 however only plane strain theoretical value of m c is available in addition the adopted n p expression also needs to be verified because the upper bound solutions are dependent of the constructed velocity field due to the difficulty in three dimensional velocity field construction compromises are often introduced therefore the present study sets out to establish three dimensional m c profile and verify the available n p profile which can be incorporated in the theoretical p y curve to achieve this goal centrifuge experiments were carried out and theoretical deduction conducted 3 centrifuge test 3 1 test preparation the test was performed at 50 g in the geotechnical centrifuge lab of the national university of singapore nus normally consolidated nc clay samples were adopted in the test a cylindrical container of 550 mm in diameter and 400 mm in depth was used to prepare clay samples a sand layer of 20 mm in thickness was placed at the bottom of the contained to facilitate clay consolidation clay slurry with a water content of 120 was made from kaolin powder and water by 8 h vacuum mixing to guarantee uniform and saturated sample after being placed in the container the slurry was first consolidated under a pressure of 4 kpa at 1 g for one week then consolidated under self weight with double drainage at 50 g for 16 h to achieve at least 95 degree of consolidation detailed soil properties of the same clay were obtained by hartono 2014 through laboratory test which is also listed in table 1 two model piles were fabricated from solid circular stainless steel bars as illustrated in fig 2 the diameter of both piles is 10 mm 0 5 m in prototype and the total length of the model pile are 150 mm 7 5 m in prototype and 280 mm 14 0 m in prototype respectively the pile tip was fabricated as a circular cone of 3 mm in height to facilitate the piling process a cylindrical enlargement of 16 mm in diameter and 35 mm in length which could be connected to the hydraulic cylinder for piling was fabricated and welded to the pile head two symmetrical slots were cut from both side of the pile head enlargement and specially designed clamping plates were fabricated to constrain pile head rotation during laterally loading the young s modulus of steel is 200 gpa and e p i p is calculated as 0 614gnm2 in prototype the young s modulus of clay can be estimated from the measured strength profile the fe simulation of yu et al 2018a indicated that the modulus of nc clay is 200 times of the undrained shear strength since the present clay sample is produced by the same procedure and consolidated under 50 g the average clay modulus at half buried depth is estimated to be 0 695 mpa l d 10 and 1 668 mpa l d 24 respectively and the relative pile soil rigidity factor k r is calculated to be 1 41 and 1 77 10 2 for the short and long pile respectively the k r value for present short pile is large than the threshold of 0 208 for a rigid pile while the k r value for present long pile falls in the range between the rigid and flexible pile between 0 0025 and 0 208 3 2 model set up after in flight consolidation of the clay sample the centrifuge was spun down to install pile and assembly the loading frame on the container previous centrifuge researches for pile in clay craig 1985 ilyas et al 2004 reported that whether the pile was installed at 1 g or in flight had limited impact on the lateral pile capacity accordingly the model pile was pressed vertically into the soil under 1 g at a constant rate of 1 mm s by a closed loop hydraulic servo valve control system the control system was composed of a servo a hydraulic cylinder to provide pressure a potentiometer to measure displacement and a guide plate to keep movement of the cylinder and the potentiometer in accordance since the same experiment setup is used for the two model piles only setup illustration with the long model pile is provided in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the closed loop control system for piling was used for in flight t bar penetration test to measure the undrained shear strength profile of clay yu et al 2018b and a similar control system was configured in the lateral direction to control pile head movement a t bar with length of 20 mm and diameter of 5 mm was used in the experiment and the horizontal distance between the t bar to the pile center was 14 pile diameters as for the lateral loading system one end of it was connected to an actuator to provide horizontal load and the other end was fixed on the stiff loading frame to provide the counter force and maintain the height of the actuator during loading the holder was designed to allow the pile and loading arm to settle with the clay during the second centrifuge spin to allow for the dissipation of excess pore pressure as well as to maintain the elevation of the loading point during lateral loading through the clamping of the loading arm the lateral load provided by the hydraulic actuator was transferred to a loading arm through a holder the pile head and the loading arm were fixed by the clamping plates to transfer lateral load to the pile under fix head condition as shown in fig 4 and a loadcell was placed between the holder and the actuator to measure the pile head force during lateral loading 3 3 test procedure and results after the pile installation and frame assembly are completed the centrifuge was spun up to 50 g for about 10 h to dissipate the pore pressured induced by soil centrifuge down time and the pile installation the final thickness of nc clay sample under the second centrifuge spin was about 290 mm 14 5 m in prototype for both tests and the buried depth of model pile is 240 mm 12 m in prototype and 100 mm 5 m in prototype resulting in length ratio l d of 24 and 10 respectively once the second in flight consolidation is completed t bar penetration tested is performed finnie 1993 demonstrated that the undrained condition could be achieved when the dimensionless velocity group factor v d c v is greater than 30 where v is the penetration velocity d is the diameter of the t bar and c v is the coefficient of consolidation for the present t bar and clay sample a velocity of 3 m s resulted in v d c v 32 that satisfied the undrained criterion therefore both the t bar penetration and the pile lateral loading afterward were executed under the rate of 3 m s following the initial penetration the t bar was retracted to a depth of about 118 mm 5 9 m in prototype after which the t bar was moved up and down over a range of 6 t bar diameters for 10 cycles as suggested by martin and randolph 2006 a constant t bar factor of 10 5 was adopt to calculate the undrained shear strength profile from reaction measured during t bar test as shown in fig 5 the strength gradient of present clay is around 1 39 kpa m and the soil sensitivity s t defined by s u 0 s u rem is around 2 95 where s u 0 is the initial strength and s u rem is the post cyclic remolded strength such soil strength properties are close to that reported by yu et al 2017a of similar nc clay under 50 g consolidation validating the sample quality of the present experiment the lateral loading of pile was performed immediately after the t bar penetration test the loading was applied by displacement control at a rate of 3 m s note that the pile head was constrained by the clamping plate during the loading so pile was rigidly translated into the soil the prototype load displacement responses measured at pile head were illustrated in fig 6 in normalized form together with available centrifuge experiments zhang et al 2010 murali et al 2015 for pile under rigid translation although the obtained pile response patterns were different the limiting state was reached in both tests the reaction force of the l d 10 pile increased linearly within a small displacement of 0 1d after which a stable value was gradually reached which can be viewed as a typical response of rigid pile under translation on the other hand the reaction force of the l d 24 pile gradually increases over a large displacement range until it finally becomes stable theoretically the present pile with l d 24 should experience some flexural deflection as its k r value is below the rigid bound which is also verified by the test result despite the existence of flexural deflection the soil surrounding the pile at different depths can reach limiting state simultaneously suppose the applied displacement load is large enough such deduction is also verified by the fe analysis presented later 4 ultimate pile capacity simulation when a pile is rigidly translated over a large displacement the surrounding soil at different depths would reach the critical state simultaneously resulting in the ultimate bearing capacity as shown in fig 6 the ultimate pile lateral capacity results were simulated by upper bound based design equation as well as fe analyses 4 1 upper bound solution based design formula the bearing capacity factor formula proposed by yu et al 2015 is adopted here which is fitted from the best upper bound solution at present the expression of yu s formula is 7 n p z min n p 0 γ z s u n f l o w n p 0 n 1 1 α n 1 n 2 1 z 14 5 0 6 1 35 n f l o w where n p 0 is the bearing capacity factor for weightless soil n 1 11 94 and n 2 3 22 the adhesion factor α is the ratio of adhesion at the pile soil interface to the undrained shear strength with α 0 for a smooth contact and α 1 for a rough contact n f l o w is the bearing capacity factor for deep mechanism under the plane strain condition and n f l o w 9 2 11 94 9 2 α is adopted which is fitted from the upper bound solution of martin and randolph 2006 the transitional depth z r below which the plastic flow mechanism is mobilized can be obtained by solving n p 0 γ z r s u n f l o w the pile head force p p i l e can be determined by integration of bearing capacity along buried depth which can be expressed as 8 p p i l e 0 l n p z s u z d d z the properties required in eq 7 and eq 8 including clay strength profile effective unit weight pile diameter and buried depth are listed in table 2 the strength expression for the oc clay of murali et al 2015 is fitted from the measured data the integration was performed by matlab software and the results were demonstrated in fig 7 together with the ultimate pile capacities measured in the experiments the stable reaction force measured at pile head under large displacement is taken as the experimental ultimate bearing capacity note that the phenomenon of pile head force weakening in zhang et al 2010 was caused by the soil structure destruction of heavy oc clay thereby the post peak stable reaction should be taken as the ultimate bearing capacity on the whole the ultimate bearing capacity calculation using eq 7 gives out acceptable results with relative error ranging from 7 to 16 the maximum error occurred for the test by murali et al 2015 which is performed in oc clay for such oc clay sample the post peak pile head force instead of the peak value should be taken as the ultimate bearing capacity to remove the effect of structure induced by over consolidation however only pile response up to the peak reaction is provided that explains the relatively large difference between the calculated bearing capacity and measured peak reaction for oc clay of murali et al 2015 as expected the calculated ultimate lateral pile capacity factor p p i l e s u a v d l increases with length ratio l d indicating that the lateral bearing capacity could be effectively increased by increasing pile buried depth 3 2 finite element analysis of centrifuge tests elasto plastic fe analyses were performed through program abaqus to simulate the centrifuge experiments of pile under rigid translation the fe models were established with parameters in prototype and the typical fe mesh layout of pile with l d 5 is shown in fig 8 examination on the boundary effect of the fe models used in this study was also carried out which revealed that the current soil domains are large enough to yield stable pile response eight node hexagon lagrangian elements with reduced integration formula were used for both the soil and pile and the number of elements employed in fe analysis ranges from 27756 to 33344 for pile with different length ratio the clay is simulated as a tresca material with associated flow rule and a poisson s ratio of 0 495 is selected to satisfy the undrained condition the undrained shear strength profile is achieved through the usdfld subroutine which is capable of defining the material property as a function of depth the undrained soil elastic modulus e could be determined by the modulus ratio e s u following yu et al 2018a e s u 200 is adopted for present soft nc clay made from kaolin powder as for the oc clay of zhang et al 2010 and murali et al 2015 a modulus ratio of 95 was used the present wished in place pile model is just an approximation of the stable state when the majority of excess pore pressure generated during the piling process has been dissipated to avoid further disturbance the t bar test was performed far from the pile over 6d as a result the measured strength profile could not directly reflect the property of soil surrounding the pile leading to further assumption about the pile soil contact parameter the isotropic initial geo stress field corresponding to the defined soil submerged unit weight γ was established by a geostatic step before the loading step all the fe analyses were performed under displacement control to simulate the fix head condition the part of pile above mudline was constrained as rigid body thereby restraining pile head rotation during lateral loading the pile soil interaction was simulated as an adhesion contact with specified adhesion maximum shear strength of 0 34 s u and the local tangential stress prior to adhesion is governed by the coulomb s law following tho et al 2013 a coulomb friction coefficient f of 0 4 is adopted in the present fe analyses to simulate rough pile soil interaction although the use of the coulomb s law in combination with a total stress analysis without modelling the pore water pressure has no particular physical meaning such adhesion interface produces a tangential response changing with depth with the strength profile and has been well verified for the pile soil simulation yu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b yu et al 2018a fe analyses with smooth pile soil interface as the most conservative cases are also performed fig 9 illustrates the pile head load displacement curves obtained by fe analyses and measured in the experiments besides the ultimate lateral pile capacity calculated by eq 7 was also marked in dash line and the results of p y will be discussed later under large displacement stable pile head reaction force was obtained in all the fe analyses which could be regarded as the ultimate bearing capacity regardless of the length ratio and pile soil interaction condition the fe bearing capacity results are always consistent with those calculated by eq 7 indicating that the present fe models are reasonable in addition fe analysis result of the present pile l d 24 provides an indirect evidence that the ultimate bearing capacity can be mobilized under large displacement the ultimate bearing capacities obtained by fe analyses are also close to that measured in experiments difference within 15 0 with the most significant difference occurs for the l d 2 pile murali et al 2015 due to the reason explained above it should be pointed out that the interpretation of fe modelling of piles l d 10 and l d 24 does not provide a consistent response in terms of the choice a smooth or adhesion interface more experiments and field test records are required to further investigate the choice of interface parameter in predictive fashion although the simplified total stress model perfectly elasto plastic with tresca yield criterion adopted in the present fe analysis is easy to use its ability to simulate the hardening soil behavior is quite limited prior to the limiting state the calculated pile head responses are generally stiffer than measured results as illustrated in fig 9 besides the present simplified model fails to simulate the capacity softening phenomenon observed in oc clay such shortcomings might be improved with more advanced model such as total stress models considering the combined hardening rule and even the effective stress ones coupled with the consolidation equation based on which more accurate p y curves e g in terms of hardening and softening and early non linear response might be established the displacement fields at limit state obtained by the fe analysis are shown in fig 10 with the contour plot for the velocity magnitude the displacement fields are normalized by the applied displacement load to facilitate comparison on the whole the soil domain mobilized under rough pile soil contact is larger than that of smooth case for piles in oc clay the soil behind the pile did no move with the pile as shown in fig 10 a and b on the contrary for piles in nc clay the soil behind the pile moved in the direction of loading together with the pile as shown in fig 10 c and d such phenomenon is in accordance with the experiment observation about whether a gap forms behind the pile zhang et al 2010 yu et al 2017a for short pile l d 2 5 under rigid translation the limit displacement field resembles a wedge while for long pile l d 10 24 a localized flow mechanism is mobilized at deep buried part as shown in fig 10 e meanwhile a wedge shape mechanism forms at the shallow part the fe limit displacement fields are similar to the three dimension upper bound velocity proposed by yu et al 2015 supporting the consistent ultimate pile capacity results obtained by fe analysis and the upper bound based design equation 5 simulation of load displacement response based on p y curve 5 1 pile compatibility factor in the present p y curve scaled from stress strain curve of soil element the compatibility factor is an important parameter that links the applied displacement δ and the average strain ε s a v through a continuous displacement field by definition ε s a v 2 ε max dv dv m c δ r 0 so the three dimensional pile compatibility factor m c pile can be determined by 9 m c p i l e r 0 δ 2 ε max d v d v where ε m a x max ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 is the largest absolute principal strain and the integration is performed over the non linear zone mobilized around the pile namely the plastic velocity field a plane strain upper bound continuous field was constructed by yu et al 2017b for the laterally loaded pile problem whose m c 2 d 0 8 and the corresponding boundary r 3 34 r 0 as the three dimension displacement field of laterally loaded pile is composed of both the deep flow mechanism and the shallow wedge mechanism a compatibility factor that varies with depth is more reasonable since both the compatibility factor m c and the upper bound bearing capacity t are determined by the displacement field and the upper bound based design equation for the bearing capacity profile is available the relationship between m c and t is investigated first for undrained clay as a tresca material the upper bound load determined from a kinematically admissible velocity field v i can be expressed as 10 t i v 2 s u ε max d v a s u δ v t d a v f i v i d v v 0 i 1 2 3 where t i is the upper bound collapse load and v 0 is the velocity at pile head f i is the body force vector in the volume v ε m a x is the absolutely largest principal plastic strain rate δ v i is the velocity jump across the discontinuity surfaces a the msd similarity assumption of δ u u is introduced here which leads to δ ε ε further consider the first increment only gives out δ u u and δ ε ε consequently eq 9 can be written as 11 m c p i l e r 0 v 0 2 ε max d v d v substitute eq 10 into eq 11 gives out 12 m c p i l e r 0 t i t g t f r i c t i o n s u a v d v where s u a v is the average undrained shear strength within the buried depth t g v f i v i d v v 0 is the load contributed by gravity and t f r i c t i o n a s u δ v i d a v 0 is the load contributed by friction as the soil is under undrained condition a wedge of width d and depth z r and length z r in direction of loading is assumed to be moved upward under the same velocity of lateral loading v 0 thereby the wedge depth z r and t g γ r 0 z r 2 can be determined to simplify the treatment of friction only the reaction force caused by friction at pile bottom is considered so t f r i c t i o n s u l π r 0 2 assume the strain is mobilized in a cylinder dominant with depth l and inner diameter r 0 and outer diameter r 3 34 r 0 corresponding to the flow mechanism then the experimental compatibility factor m c pile of a laterally loaded pile can be calculated by putting the measured ultimate load into eq 12 the experimental m c pile results of the centrifuge experiments are listed in table 3 the obtained experimental m c pile gradually increases with the pile length ratio and approaches the theoretical value 0 8 corresponding to a pile with infinite buried depth the difference of murali et al 2015 and zhang et al 2010 in m c pile values might be caused by the peak pile reaction force being treated as ultimate bearing capacity for oc clay the compatibility factor to be used in the p y expression of eq 3 is the two dimension compatibility factor m c 2 d corresponding to the soil section at a given depth as the relationship between the upper bound limit load at pile head t and the pile compatibility factor m c pile was established through continuous fields similar relationship could be obtained for their derivatives with respect to depth namely n p 0 and m c 2 d suppose a continuous field exists the field is divided and represented by discrete two dimension plates with inner diameter of r 0 and outer diameter of 3 34 r 0 to determine m c 2 d at different depths for continuous fields the bearing capacity factor for weightless soil n p 0 can be expressed as 13 n p 0 ε max d v r 0 v 0 the factor m c 2 d corresponding to the same continuous field can be written as 14 m c 2 d r 0 v 0 2 ε max d v d v r 0 v 0 2 n p 0 r 0 v 0 π 3 34 r 0 2 r 0 2 n p 0 5 0778 π further consider an adjustment factor of θ over m c 2 d for the shallow wedge zone and m c 2 d 0 8 for the deep flow zone of z z r to get 15 m c 2 d z θ n p 0 5 0778 π z z r 0 8 z z r the value of θ can be determined through fitting process using the experimental m c pile as benchmark it should be pointed out that only the results of pile with l d 5 10 and 24 was used in the fitting process due to the overestimation of ultimate bearing capacity of the l d 2 pile the pattern search function within matlab package was employed and the obtained optimal value of θ is 0 816 the experimental and calculated m c pile results are compared in fig 11 which demonstrates basic consistency 5 2 centrifuge test simulation by using the three dimension upper bound solution based bearing capacity factor equation of eq 7 and the compatibility factor profile defined by eq 15 the three dimension effect can be considered in the present p y curve of eq 3 besides the coefficient a is determined from three dimension elastic solution for laterally loaded pile proposed by zhang et al 2016a the fourth order controlling equation for the beam on nonlinear spring problem was written in difference form and solve by nonlinear iteration which is also implemented in matlab package analyses using the api p y curve defined by eq 1 and eq 2 were also performed for comparison it should be pointed out that the power function of eq 1 was replaced with subsection lines to avoid infinite initial slope and typical values of ε 50 0 015 and j 0 25 were used for the api p y curve the calculated load displacement results for the centrifuge experiment of pile under rigid lateral translation are shown in fig 9 generally the pile responses obtained by the present p y curve are close to the fe and experiment results on the contrary the results of the api p y curve underestimate the pile response at both sls and uls the present p y curve is also applied to analyze the free head monopile in nc clay by yu et al 2017a the result of the free head pile is given in fig 12 where good agreement between the fe analysis and experiment result is found result of the present p y curve underestimates the pile response by around 30 and the underestimation by the api p y curve is more prominent around 70 for such free head monopile 5 3 parametric analyses to further evaluate the performance of the present p y curve parametric analyses for laterally loaded free head pile were also carried out there are in total 7 parameters that might influence the lateral response of a pile in undrained clay 1 pile diameter d 2 pile buried depth l 3 eccentricity of loading above the soil surface e 4 undrained shear strength of the soil 5 effective unit weight of soil γ 6 young s modulus of soil e and 7 adhesion factor α at the pile soil interface these influence parameters can be expressed into 6 dimensionless factors 1 pile length ratio l d 2 loading eccentricity ratio e d 3 soil strength ratio γ d s u 4 soil modulus ratio e s u 5 relative pile soil rigid factor k r and 6 adhesion factor α to find out the parametric range in practice available pile tests in clay were reviewed and classified into flexible and rigid piles respectively the parameters of flexible pile tests obtained from guo 2013 were listed in table 4 where the values of k r were supplemented more recently with the development of offshore wind farms monopiles with large diameter small length ratio and substantial flexural rigidity have been increasingly used table 5 summarized the parameters of available rigid pile tests in clay based on tables 4 and 5 typical parameter combinations were selected that were case 1 d 0 5 m e 1 0 m l d 60 k r 10 4 case 2 d 0 5 m e 1 0 m l d 15 k r 10 3 and case 3 d 1 5 m e 10 0 m l d 6 k r 0 5 and α 0 34 and e s u 200 were adopted in all the cases clearly the former two cases represent typical flexible piles and the latter one represents a typical rigid pile apart from analyses with the present p y curve corresponding analyses by the fe and the api p y curve were also performed as the rigid monopiles designed as offshore wind turbine foundation are governed by pile head rotation det norske veritas 2004 both load displacement and load rotation curves of lateral piles are demonstrated in fig 13 in general the results of present p y curve agreed with those of fe analysis under different parameter combinations while the results of api p y curve underestimate the pile response in varying degrees the normalized pile side modulus p u l s u a v p d l s u a v u d at u 0 001 d is used to evaluate the initial response of lateral piles for the typical flexible pile cases the differences of initial response between the present p y curve and fe results are within 2 0 while results of the api p y curve generally underestimate the fe results by around 55 0 for the typical rigid pile the difference of initial response obtained by the present p y curve and fe analysis is 6 5 and the underestimation of the api p y curve results to those of fe analysis is increased to around 85 0 which is in accordance with the finding of byrne et al 2017 that the api p y curve tends to underestimate the initial lateral responses of rigid piles such incapability of the api p y curve in rigid pile analysis might be attributed to its extrapolated application far beyond the original field test database in terms of ultimate lateral bearing capacity the maximum load within the analysis range is taken as the bearing capacity of the flexible pile while the bearing capacity of rigid pile is assumed to be achieved at pile head rotation of 0 5 for the flexible piles the differences between bearing capacity results by the present p y curve and fe results are within 10 0 while results of the api p y curve underestimate the fe results by around 22 0 as for the rigid pile the bearing capacity results of the present and api p y curves are 20 8 and 71 0 less than the fe analysis result respectively the bearing capacity underestimation by the api p y curve for flexible pile might be attributed to the conservative assumption of a smooth pile soil interface yet the extreme underestimation indicates that the api p y curve is not applicable for rigid piles the bearing capacity difference between the present p y curve and fe analysis for the rigid pile might be attribute to the fact that pile bottom kick out phenomenon is observed in the fe simulation which is not considered in the bearing capacity profile adopted in the present p y curve 6 conclusions a framework to consider three dimensional effects including the ultimate pile capacity pile compatibility and initial subgrade modulus in the t emsd based p y curve of laterally loaded pile in undrained clay is presented to verify the ultimate pile lateral bearing capacity design equation centrifuge experiments of rigid fix head piles under lateral translation were designed and performed in nc clay the present limiting loads on pile head were compared to calculated results by the design equation for pile ultimate lateral capacity and fe analysis analyses were also made for previous tests with different length ratios which indicate that the results by the design equation and fe analysis are close to those measured in the experiments the relationship between the pile compatibility factor and upper bound limiting load is established based on continuous fields therefore the measured ultimate pile lateral loads were used to determine the experimental pile compatibility factor and theoretical compatibility factor corresponding to a soil section was also proposed and calibrated by the experimental pile compatibility factor then the compatibility factor profile was adopted in the p y curve scaled from soil stress strain curve to consider the difference in mechanism mobilized at different depth finally the present p y curve was applied in centrifuge experiment simulation and parametric analysis analysis result indicates that the present p y curve provides pile response close to those of fe analysis and experiment results besides the present p y curve method always gives out more accurate prediction compared with the api p y curve method thus the present p y curve is recommended for the design of lateral pile in clay with relative pile soil rigidity factor from 10 4 to 0 5 although the form of the present p y approach is still very complex it has the merit of a clear theoretical basis and might shed light on the modification of the standard p y approach credit authorship contribution statement sen li methodology software investigation writing original draft visualization jian yu methodology software investigation maosong huang

21858,to apply the p y curve method in laterally loaded pile analyses three dimensional effects in component such as the ultimate pile bearing capacity pile compatibility factor and initial subgrade

presented the bearing capacity design equation can be used to estimate the continuous velocity fields based pile compatibility factor profile to verify the pile bearing capacity design equation fitted from an upper bound solution centrifuge experiments of rigidly translated piles were performed corresponding finite element analyses were also performed the pile compatibility factor profile was obtained through the verified bearing capacity equation and experimental results finally the applications of plane strain p y curves to three dimensional problems were demonstrated via experiment simulation and parametric study keywords laterally loaded pile ultimate bearing capacity factor compatibility factor p y curve centrifuge experiment 1 introduction in offshore engineering pile foundations are often designed to sustain lateral load such as wind and wave both the deformation control at serviceability limit state sls and lateral load at ultimate limit state uls are important guidance for pile design available pile design methods include elasto plastic numerical methods elastic continuum methods and subgrade reaction methods although elasto plastic finite element fe method can provide both sls bransby 1999 jeanjean 2009 and uls zhang et al 2016b truong and lehane 2017 for laterally loaded piles expertise concerning the analysis parameter setting property choice and even soil constitutive model implementation is required to guarantee the rationality of fe analysis based on the mindlin s solution the elastic continuum method baguelin et al 1977 banerjee and davies 1978 poulos and davis 1980 kitiyodom and matsumoto 2003 zhang et al 2016a cannot be extended to analyze the nonlinear behavior of laterally loaded piles accordingly the application of the elastic continuum method is confined in sls design in the subgrade reaction method the soil surrounding the pile is represented by a series of discrete horizontal springs whose responses are independent of others the reaction deformation relationship of the discrete springs can be taken linear guo and lee 2001 hirai 2012 zhang et al 2016a or nonlinear matlock 1970 reese et al 1975 nogami et al 1992 georgiadis et al 1992 bransby 1999 klar 2008 zhang and ahmari 2013 byrne et al 2017 which is also termed as the p y curve model as the p y curve method can conveniently take nonlinear behavior and non homogeneity property of soil into account it has been extensively applied to the analyses of lateral loaded piles available p y curves were primarily based on empirical curve fitted from laboratory or centrifuge model tests matlock 1970 yan and byrne 1992 dyson and randolph 1997 jeanjean 2009 hong et al 2017 or finite element results bransby 1999 templeton 2009 truong and lehane 2017 in which the definition proposed by matlock 1970 and recommended by american petroleum institute api are widely adopted in practice to demonstrate the essential components involving p y curve construction the p y curve by matlock 1970 for laterally loaded pile in soft clay is given as follows 1 p 0 5 p u y y c 1 3 where y c 2 5 ε 50 d is the critical lateral displacement with ε 50 representing the axial strain under one half of maximum deviatoric stress in laboratory undrained compression tests on undisturbed clay samples and d is pile diameter p u n p d s u is the ultimate lateral load per unit depth n p is the ultimate bearing capacity factor and s u is the undrained shear strength of clay the n p definition of api approach is 2 n p z 3 j z d γ z s u z z r 9 z z r where z is the depth below mudline γ is the effective unit weight of clay j is a dimensionless empirical constant ranging from 0 25 to 0 5 with 0 25 for soft clay and 0 5 for stiff clay z r 6 d γ d s u j is the transition depth from the matlock formula two essential components of p y curve are identified one is the backbone curve of eq 1 that describes the nonlinear evolution of subgrade reaction modulus k h p y the other is the profile of ultimate bearing capacity given in eq 2 the laboratory stress strain curve is implicitly represented by a controlling point in eq 1 thereby considering the soil property to better understand the mechanism of pile soil interaction substantial effort has been made to either establish the theoretical basis for ultimate bearing capacity factor or construct backbone curve that considers the soil stress strain relation in proper way in terms of uls randolph and houlsby 1984 obtained the limiting lateral pressure on a plane strain circular pile by the limit analysis method and the most accurate analytical upper bound solutions of the same problem were provided by martin and randolph 2006 by combining the shallow wedge mechanism and the deep full flow mechanism such as that proposed by randolph and houlsby 1984 murff and hamilton 1993 constructed a three dimensional velocity field for laterally load pile and conducted upper bound limit analysis by modifying the shape function for the shallow wedge of the combined mechanism yu et al 2015 improved the upper bound n p profile of murff and hamilton 1993 yu et al 2017a further proposed a shallow wedge mechanism that considered the progressive rotation of a rigid pile whose upper bound solutions agreed well with the centrifuge experiment results at the large rotation angles a continuous three dimensional upper bound velocity field was also constructed by klar and randolph 2008 for flexible piles klar 2008 applied the msd approach osman and bolton 2005 to generate p y curve by scaling from soil stress strain curve the scaling factors were analytically derived from a continuous mechanism by upper bound analysis for stress load factor and deformation compatibility for strain displacement factor klar and osman 2008 further improved the accuracy of such stress strain curve based p y curve by the emsd approach with incremental steps where the velocity field could evolve but the simplicity of constant scaling factors is lost yu et al 2017b presented a new t emsd approach to construct continuous mechanism by elastic iteration and applied the method in generating p y curve following klar 2008 similarly the p y curves presented by zhang and andersen 2017 were also scaled from laboratory stress strain curve with scale factor calibrated by fe results although the analytical p y curve proposed by klar 2008 and yu et al 2017b is derived from the plane strain continuous mechanism three dimensional effect can be taking into account through the ultimate bearing capacity factor compatibility factor and initial subgrade modulus the compatibility factor defines the relationship between the pile section displacement and the average strain surrounding the pile push over results of fixed head rigid piles zhang et al 2010 murali et al 2015 can be used to verify the upper bound n p profile however the available tests were exclusively conducted for short rigid pile with l d 5 where l is the pile buried depth accordingly centrifuge experiment of long rigid pile is designed and performed in the present study to bridge the gap the variation pattern of compatibility factor with depth was also investigated based on the test results besides the present analytical p y curve is applied to simulate centrifuge tests and analysis example 2 consideration of three dimensional effects in t emsd based p y curves although the laterally loaded piles are typical three dimensional problem the p y curves are derived from the plane strain analysis model thus three dimensional effects should be incorporated in the p y curves such three dimensional effects can be separated into three categories namely the ultimate bearing capacity factor n p compatibility factor m c and initial subgrade modulus k i n i the parameter n p defines the relationship between the pile lateral limiting bearing pressure p u and the undrained shear strength s u the parameter m c defines the relationship between the pile section displacement y d and the average strain ε s a v e within the fully mobilized nonlinear zone surrounding the pile which is independent of the elastic region the parameter k i n i defines the elastic response of the pile soil system as shown in fig 1 the values of n p m c and k i n i would vary with depth reflecting the three dimensional pile soil interaction and the scaling relationship between the stress strain curve and the p y backbone curve is derived from the plane strain analysis model ideally the p y backbone curve should contain n p m c and k i n i so that the three dimensional effects could be naturally taken into account in the case of the api p y curve formulation only n p is contained in the p y backbone formula accordingly only three dimensional n p expression is suggested although k ini is not explicitly expressed in the api approach derivation of the p y relationship leads to an infinite value for k ini which has no particular physical meaning in practice secant stiffness is used for the api p y method instead of tangent stiffness to avoid the treatment of infinity comparing the definition of m c given by ε s a v 2 ε max dv dv m c y d r 0 and the api formulation to link soil strain with pile section displacement by y c 2 5 ε 50 d where r 0 d 2 is the pile radius some similarity between them is identified suppose ε 50 and y c are equivalent of ε s a v and y d respectively y c 2 5 ε 50 d could be rewritten as ε s a v 1 5 y d r 0 resulting in m c 0 2 since the expression of y c is irrelevant to depth constant m c is adopted in the api p y curve the parameter k i n i is not expressed explicitly in the api p y curve after reviewing the api p y curve let us focus on the analytical p y curve proposed by klar 2008 and yu et al 2017b which is theoretically derived from a plane strain pile soil bearing mechanism with the soil stress strain curve taken into account the analytical p y is given as 3 p n p r 0 s u 1 5 m c a r 0 s u 0 5 a e y n p r 0 s u 1 5 m c a r 0 s u 0 5 a e y 2 2 a e n p r 0 s u y where e is the young s modulus of soil in the plane strain analytical model the soil is separated into an outer linear zone and an inner nonlinear zone by a rigid ring to avoid unrealistic overestimation of the initial subgrade modulus the radius of the ring is determined by the optimal mechanism whose effect is reflected in m c and a e defines the linear stiffness of the ring relative to the out linear zone by derivation of eq 3 the initial subgrade modulus defined by the p y curve can be written as 4 d p d y y 0 a e m c n p m c n p 1 5 a as the lateral pile stiffness derived from plane strain elastic model is boundary dependent three dimensional solution should be used instead baguelin et al 1977 klar 2008 thereby linking a e with k i n i accordingly k i n i d p d y leads to non dimensional coefficient a m c n p k i n i m c n p e 1 5 k i n i since n p m c and k i n i are contained in the theoretical p y curve three dimensional effects can be easily taken into account demonstrating the merits of the theoretically derived p y curve over the api formulation the n p expression of yu et al 2015 using the upper bound limit analysis and the k i n i expression of zhang et al 2016a by comparing the solution of the elastic continuum method and that of the linear subgrade reaction method are adopted in the present study 5 k i n i h 7 5 η h 1 v 2 3 4 v e 1 v 2 e d 4 e p i p 12 k r 10 2 7 5 η h 1 v 2 3 4 v e 1 v 2 100 d l 4 12 k r 10 2 where k r e p i p e l 4 is the relative pile soil rigidity factor defined by poulos and davis 1980 e p i p is the pile flexural rigidity and h stands for the depth under consideration as z is used as an integral variable in factor η h 6 η h 1 v e l 2 1 v 6 8 v ln l

h z 2 r 2 b 2 h z 2 however only plane strain theoretical value of m c is available in addition the adopted n p expression also needs to be verified because the upper bound solutions are dependent of the constructed velocity field due to the difficulty in three dimensional velocity field construction compromises are often introduced therefore the present study sets out to establish three dimensional m c profile and verify the available n p profile which can be incorporated in the theoretical p y curve to achieve this goal centrifuge experiments were carried out and theoretical deduction conducted 3 centrifuge test 3 1 test preparation the test was performed at 50 g in the geotechnical centrifuge lab of the national university of singapore nus normally consolidated nc clay samples were adopted in the test a cylindrical container of 550 mm in diameter and 400 mm in depth was used to prepare clay samples a sand layer of 20 mm in thickness was placed at the bottom of the contained to facilitate clay consolidation clay slurry with a water content of 120 was made from kaolin powder and water by 8 h vacuum mixing to guarantee uniform and saturated sample after being placed in the container the slurry was first consolidated under a pressure of 4 kpa at 1 g for one week then consolidated under self weight with double drainage at 50 g for 16 h to achieve at least 95 degree of consolidation detailed soil properties of the same clay were obtained by hartono 2014 through laboratory test which is also listed in table 1 two model piles were fabricated from solid circular stainless steel bars as illustrated in fig 2 the diameter of both piles is 10 mm 0 5 m in prototype and the total length of the model pile are 150 mm 7 5 m in prototype and 280 mm 14 0 m in prototype respectively the pile tip was fabricated as a circular cone of 3 mm in height to facilitate the piling process a cylindrical enlargement of 16 mm in diameter and 35 mm in length which could be connected to the hydraulic cylinder for piling was fabricated and welded to the pile head two symmetrical slots were cut from both side of the pile head enlargement and specially designed clamping plates were fabricated to constrain pile head rotation during laterally loading the young s modulus of steel is 200 gpa and e p i p is calculated as 0 614gnm2 in prototype the young s modulus of clay can be estimated from the measured strength profile the fe simulation of yu et al 2018a indicated that the modulus of nc clay is 200 times of the undrained shear strength since the present clay sample is produced by the same procedure and consolidated under 50 g the average clay modulus at half buried depth is estimated to be 0 695 mpa l d 10 and 1 668 mpa l d 24 respectively and the relative pile soil rigidity factor k r is calculated to be 1 41 and 1 77 10 2 for the short and long pile respectively the k r value for present short pile is large than the threshold of 0 208 for a rigid pile while the k r value for present long pile falls in the range between the rigid and flexible pile between 0 0025 and 0 208 3 2 model set up after in flight consolidation of the clay sample the centrifuge was spun down to install pile and assembly the loading frame on the container previous centrifuge researches for pile in clay craig 1985 ilyas et al 2004 reported that whether the pile was installed at 1 g or in flight had limited impact on the lateral pile capacity accordingly the model pile was pressed vertically into the soil under 1 g at a constant rate of 1 mm s by a closed loop hydraulic servo valve control system the control system was composed of a servo a hydraulic cylinder to provide pressure a potentiometer to measure displacement and a guide plate to keep movement of the cylinder and the potentiometer in accordance since the same experiment setup is used for the two model piles only setup illustration with the long model pile is provided in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the closed loop control system for piling was used for in flight t bar penetration test to measure the undrained shear strength profile of clay yu et al 2018b and a similar control system was configured in the lateral direction to control pile head movement a t bar with length of 20 mm and diameter of 5 mm was used in the experiment and the horizontal distance between the t bar to the pile center was 14 pile diameters as for the lateral loading system one end of it was connected to an actuator to provide horizontal load and the other end was fixed on the stiff loading frame to provide the counter force and maintain the height of the actuator during loading the holder was designed to allow the pile and loading arm to settle with the clay during the second centrifuge spin to allow for the dissipation of excess pore pressure as well as to maintain the elevation of the loading point during lateral loading through the clamping of the loading arm the lateral load provided by the hydraulic actuator was transferred to a loading arm through a holder the pile head and the loading arm were fixed by the clamping plates to transfer lateral load to the pile under fix head condition as shown in fig 4 and a loadcell was placed between the holder and the actuator to measure the pile head force during lateral loading 3 3 test procedure and results after the pile installation and frame assembly are completed the centrifuge was spun up to 50 g for about 10 h to dissipate the pore pressured induced by soil centrifuge down time and the pile installation the final thickness of nc clay sample under the second centrifuge spin was about 290 mm 14 5 m in prototype for both tests and the buried depth of model pile is 240 mm 12 m in prototype and 100 mm 5 m in prototype resulting in length ratio l d of 24 and 10 respectively once the second in flight consolidation is completed t bar penetration tested is performed finnie 1993 demonstrated that the undrained condition could be achieved when the dimensionless velocity group factor v d c v is greater than 30 where v is the penetration velocity d is the diameter of the t bar and c v is the coefficient of consolidation for the present t bar and clay sample a velocity of 3 m s resulted in v d c v 32 that satisfied the undrained criterion therefore both the t bar penetration and the pile lateral loading afterward were executed under the rate of 3 m s following the initial penetration the t bar was retracted to a depth of about 118 mm 5 9 m in prototype after which the t bar was moved up and down over a range of 6 t bar diameters for 10 cycles as suggested by martin and randolph 2006 a constant t bar factor of 10 5 was adopt to calculate the undrained shear strength profile from reaction measured during t bar test as shown in fig 5 the strength gradient of present clay is around 1 39 kpa m and the soil sensitivity s t defined by s u 0 s u rem is around 2 95 where s u 0 is the initial strength and s u rem is the post cyclic remolded strength such soil strength properties are close to that reported by yu et al 2017a of similar nc clay under 50 g consolidation validating the sample quality of the present experiment the lateral loading of pile was performed immediately after the t bar penetration test the loading was applied by displacement control at a rate of 3 m s note that the pile head was constrained by the clamping plate during the loading so pile was rigidly translated into the soil the prototype load displacement responses measured at pile head were illustrated in fig 6 in normalized form together with available centrifuge experiments zhang et al 2010 murali et al 2015 for pile under rigid translation although the obtained pile response patterns were different the limiting state was reached in both tests the reaction force of the l d 10 pile increased linearly within a small displacement of 0 1d after which a stable value was gradually reached which can be viewed as a typical response of rigid pile under translation on the other hand the reaction force of the l d 24 pile gradually increases over a large displacement range until it finally becomes stable theoretically the present pile with l d 24 should experience some flexural deflection as its k r value is below the rigid bound which is also verified by the test result despite the existence of flexural deflection the soil surrounding the pile at different depths can reach limiting state simultaneously suppose the applied displacement load is large enough such deduction is also verified by the fe analysis presented later 4 ultimate pile capacity simulation when a pile is rigidly translated over a large displacement the surrounding soil at different depths would reach the critical state simultaneously resulting in the ultimate bearing capacity as shown in fig 6 the ultimate pile lateral capacity results were simulated by upper bound based design equation as well as fe analyses 4 1 upper bound solution based design formula the bearing capacity factor formula proposed by yu et al 2015 is adopted here which is fitted from the best upper bound solution at present the expression of yu s formula is 7 n p z min n p 0 γ z s u n f l o w n p 0 n 1 1 α n 1 n 2 1 z 14 5 0 6 1 35 n f l o w where n p 0 is the bearing capacity factor for weightless soil n 1 11 94 and n 2 3 22 the adhesion factor α is the ratio of adhesion at the pile soil interface to the undrained shear strength with α 0 for a smooth contact and α 1 for a rough contact n f l o w is the bearing capacity factor for deep mechanism under the plane strain condition and n f l o w 9 2 11 94 9 2 α is adopted which is fitted from the upper bound solution of martin and randolph 2006 the transitional depth z r below which the plastic flow mechanism is mobilized can be obtained by solving n p 0 γ z r s u n f l o w the pile head force p p i l e can be determined by integration of bearing capacity along buried depth which can be expressed as 8 p p i l e 0 l n p z s u z d d z the properties required in eq 7 and eq 8 including clay strength profile effective unit weight pile diameter and buried depth are listed in table 2 the strength expression for the oc clay of murali et al 2015 is fitted from the measured data the integration was performed by matlab software and the results were demonstrated in fig 7 together with the ultimate pile capacities measured in the experiments the stable reaction force measured at pile head under large displacement is taken as the experimental ultimate bearing capacity note that the phenomenon of pile head force weakening in zhang et al 2010 was caused by the soil structure destruction of heavy oc clay thereby the post peak stable reaction should be taken as the ultimate bearing capacity on the whole the ultimate bearing capacity calculation using eq 7 gives out acceptable results with relative error ranging from 7 to 16 the maximum error occurred for the test by murali et al 2015 which is performed in oc clay for such oc clay sample the post peak pile head force instead of the peak value should be taken as the ultimate bearing capacity to remove the effect of structure induced by over consolidation however only pile response up to the peak reaction is provided that explains the relatively large difference between the calculated bearing capacity and measured peak reaction for oc clay of murali et al 2015 as expected the calculated ultimate lateral pile capacity factor p p i l e s u a v d l increases with length ratio l d indicating that the lateral bearing capacity could be effectively increased by increasing pile buried depth 3 2 finite element analysis of centrifuge tests elasto plastic fe analyses were performed through program abaqus to simulate the centrifuge experiments of pile under rigid translation the fe models were established with parameters in prototype and the typical fe mesh layout of pile with l d 5 is shown in fig 8 examination on the boundary effect of the fe models used in this study was also carried out which revealed that the current soil domains are large enough to yield stable pile response eight node hexagon lagrangian elements with reduced integration formula were used for both the soil and pile and the number of elements employed in fe analysis ranges from 27756 to 33344 for pile with different length ratio the clay is simulated as a tresca material with associated flow rule and a poisson s ratio of 0 495 is selected to satisfy the undrained condition the undrained shear strength profile is achieved through the usdfld subroutine which is capable of defining the material property as a function of depth the undrained soil elastic modulus e could be determined by the modulus ratio e s u following yu et al 2018a e s u 200 is adopted for present soft nc clay made from kaolin powder as for the oc clay of zhang et al 2010 and murali et al 2015 a modulus ratio of 95 was used the present wished in place pile model is just an approximation of the stable state when the majority of excess pore pressure generated during the piling process has been dissipated to avoid further disturbance the t bar test was performed far from the pile over 6d as a result the measured strength profile could not directly reflect the property of soil surrounding the pile leading to further assumption about the pile soil contact parameter the isotropic initial geo stress field corresponding to the defined soil submerged unit weight γ was established by a geostatic step before the loading step all the fe analyses were performed under displacement control to simulate the fix head condition the part of pile above mudline was constrained as rigid body thereby restraining pile head rotation during lateral loading the pile soil interaction was simulated as an adhesion contact with specified adhesion maximum shear strength of 0 34 s u and the local tangential stress prior to adhesion is governed by the coulomb s law following tho et al 2013 a coulomb friction coefficient f of 0 4 is adopted in the present fe analyses to simulate rough pile soil interaction although the use of the coulomb s law in combination with a total stress analysis without modelling the pore water pressure has no particular physical meaning such adhesion interface produces a tangential response changing with depth with the strength profile and has been well verified for the pile soil simulation yu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b yu et al 2018a fe analyses with smooth pile soil interface as the most conservative cases are also performed fig 9 illustrates the pile head load displacement curves obtained by fe analyses and measured in the experiments besides the ultimate lateral pile capacity calculated by eq 7 was also marked in dash line and the results of p y will be discussed later under large displacement stable pile head reaction force was obtained in all the fe analyses which could be regarded as the ultimate bearing capacity regardless of the length ratio and pile soil interaction condition the fe bearing capacity results are always consistent with those calculated by eq 7 indicating that the present fe models are reasonable in addition fe analysis result of the present pile l d 24 provides an indirect evidence that the ultimate bearing capacity can be mobilized under large displacement the ultimate bearing capacities obtained by fe analyses are also close to that measured in experiments difference within 15 0 with the most significant difference occurs for the l d 2 pile murali et al 2015 due to the reason explained above it should be pointed out that the interpretation of fe modelling of piles l d 10 and l d 24 does not provide a consistent response in terms of the choice a smooth or adhesion interface more experiments and field test records are required to further investigate the choice of interface parameter in predictive fashion although the simplified total stress model perfectly elasto plastic with tresca yield criterion adopted in the present fe analysis is easy to use its ability to simulate the hardening soil behavior is quite limited prior to the limiting state the calculated pile head responses are generally stiffer than measured results as illustrated in fig 9 besides the present simplified model fails to simulate the capacity softening phenomenon observed in oc clay such shortcomings might be improved with more advanced model such as total stress models considering the combined hardening rule and even the effective stress ones coupled with the consolidation equation based on which more accurate p y curves e g in terms of hardening and softening and early non linear response might be established the displacement fields at limit state obtained by the fe analysis are shown in fig 10 with the contour plot for the velocity magnitude the displacement fields are normalized by the applied displacement load to facilitate comparison on the whole the soil domain mobilized under rough pile soil contact is larger than that of smooth case for piles in oc clay the soil behind the pile did no move with the pile as shown in fig 10 a and b on the contrary for piles in nc clay the soil behind the pile moved in the direction of loading together with the pile as shown in fig 10 c and d such phenomenon is in accordance with the experiment observation about whether a gap forms behind the pile zhang et al 2010 yu et al 2017a for short pile l d 2 5 under rigid translation the limit displacement field resembles a wedge while for long pile l d 10 24 a localized flow mechanism is mobilized at deep buried part as shown in fig 10 e meanwhile a wedge shape mechanism forms at the shallow part the fe limit displacement fields are similar to the three dimension upper bound velocity proposed by yu et al 2015 supporting the consistent ultimate pile capacity results obtained by fe analysis and the upper bound based design equation 5 simulation of load displacement response based on p y curve 5 1 pile compatibility factor in the present p y curve scaled from stress strain curve of soil element the compatibility factor is an important parameter that links the applied displacement δ and the average strain ε s a v through a continuous displacement field by definition ε s a v 2 ε max dv dv m c δ r 0 so the three dimensional pile compatibility factor m c pile can be determined by 9 m c p i l e r 0 δ 2 ε max d v d v where ε m a x max ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 is the largest absolute principal strain and the integration is performed over the non linear zone mobilized around the pile namely the plastic velocity field a plane strain upper bound continuous field was constructed by yu et al 2017b for the laterally loaded pile problem whose m c 2 d 0 8 and the corresponding boundary r 3 34 r 0 as the three dimension displacement field of laterally loaded pile is composed of both the deep flow mechanism and the shallow wedge mechanism a compatibility factor that varies with depth is more reasonable since both the compatibility factor m c and the upper bound bearing capacity t are determined by the displacement field and the upper bound based design equation for the bearing capacity profile is available the relationship between m c and t is investigated first for undrained clay as a tresca material the upper bound load determined from a kinematically admissible velocity field v i can be expressed as 10 t i v 2 s u ε max d v a s u δ v t d a v f i v i d v v 0 i 1 2 3 where t i is the upper bound collapse load and v 0 is the velocity at pile head f i is the body force vector in the volume v ε m a x is the absolutely largest principal plastic strain rate δ v i is the velocity jump across the discontinuity surfaces a the msd similarity assumption of δ u u is introduced here which leads to δ ε ε further consider the first increment only gives out δ u u and δ ε ε consequently eq 9 can be written as 11 m c p i l e r 0 v 0 2 ε max d v d v substitute eq 10 into eq 11 gives out 12 m c p i l e r 0 t i t g t f r i c t i o n s u a v d v where s u a v is the average undrained shear strength within the buried depth t g v f i v i d v v 0 is the load contributed by gravity and t f r i c t i o n a s u δ v i d a v 0 is the load contributed by friction as the soil is under undrained condition a wedge of width d and depth z r and length z r in direction of loading is assumed to be moved upward under the same velocity of lateral loading v 0 thereby the wedge depth z r and t g γ r 0 z r 2 can be determined to simplify the treatment of friction only the reaction force caused by friction at pile bottom is considered so t f r i c t i o n s u l π r 0 2 assume the strain is mobilized in a cylinder dominant with depth l and inner diameter r 0 and outer diameter r 3 34 r 0 corresponding to the flow mechanism then the experimental compatibility factor m c pile of a laterally loaded pile can be calculated by putting the measured ultimate load into eq 12 the experimental m c pile results of the centrifuge experiments are listed in table 3 the obtained experimental m c pile gradually increases with the pile length ratio and approaches the theoretical value 0 8 corresponding to a pile with infinite buried depth the difference of murali et al 2015 and zhang et al 2010 in m c pile values might be caused by the peak pile reaction force being treated as ultimate bearing capacity for oc clay the compatibility factor to be used in the p y expression of eq 3 is the two dimension compatibility factor m c 2 d corresponding to the soil section at a given depth as the relationship between the upper bound limit load at pile head t and the pile compatibility factor m c pile was established through continuous fields similar relationship could be obtained for their derivatives with respect to depth namely n p 0 and m c 2 d suppose a continuous field exists the field is divided and represented by discrete two dimension plates with inner diameter of r 0 and outer diameter of 3 34 r 0 to determine m c 2 d at different depths for continuous fields the bearing capacity factor for weightless soil n p 0 can be expressed as 13 n p 0 ε max d v r 0 v 0 the factor m c 2 d corresponding to the same continuous field can be written as 14 m c 2 d r 0 v 0 2 ε max d v d v r 0 v 0 2 n p 0 r 0 v 0 π 3 34 r 0 2 r 0 2 n p 0 5 0778 π further consider an adjustment factor of θ over m c 2 d for the shallow wedge zone and m c 2 d 0 8 for the deep flow zone of z z r to get 15 m c 2 d z θ n p 0 5 0778 π z z r 0 8 z z r the value of θ can be determined through fitting process using the experimental m c pile as benchmark it should be pointed out that only the results of pile with l d 5 10 and 24 was used in the fitting process due to the overestimation of ultimate bearing capacity of the l d 2 pile the pattern search function within matlab package was employed and the obtained optimal value of θ is 0 816 the experimental and calculated m c pile results are compared in fig 11 which demonstrates basic consistency 5 2 centrifuge test simulation by using the three dimension upper bound solution based bearing capacity factor equation of eq 7 and the compatibility factor profile defined by eq 15 the three dimension effect can be considered in the present p y curve of eq 3 besides the coefficient a is determined from three dimension elastic solution for laterally loaded pile proposed by zhang et al 2016a the fourth order controlling equation for the beam on nonlinear spring problem was written in difference form and solve by nonlinear iteration which is also implemented in matlab package analyses using the api p y curve defined by eq 1 and eq 2 were also performed for comparison it should be pointed out that the power function of eq 1 was replaced with subsection lines to avoid infinite initial slope and typical values of ε 50 0 015 and j 0 25 were used for the api p y curve the calculated load displacement results for the centrifuge experiment of pile under rigid lateral translation are shown in fig 9 generally the pile responses obtained by the present p y curve are close to the fe and experiment results on the contrary the results of the api p y curve underestimate the pile response at both sls and uls the present p y curve is also applied to analyze the free head monopile in nc clay by yu et al 2017a the result of the free head pile is given in fig 12 where good agreement between the fe analysis and experiment result is found result of the present p y curve underestimates the pile response by around 30 and the underestimation by the api p y curve is more prominent around 70 for such free head monopile 5 3 parametric analyses to further evaluate the performance of the present p y curve parametric analyses for laterally loaded free head pile were also carried out there are in total 7 parameters that might influence the lateral response of a pile in undrained clay 1 pile diameter d 2 pile buried depth l 3 eccentricity of loading above the soil surface e 4 undrained shear strength of the soil 5 effective unit weight of soil γ 6 young s modulus of soil e and 7 adhesion factor α at the pile soil interface these influence parameters can be expressed into 6 dimensionless factors 1 pile length ratio l d 2 loading eccentricity ratio e d 3 soil strength ratio γ d s u 4 soil modulus ratio e s u 5 relative pile soil rigid factor k r and 6 adhesion factor α to find out the parametric range in practice available pile tests in clay were reviewed and classified into flexible and rigid piles respectively the parameters of flexible pile tests obtained from guo 2013 were listed in table 4 where the values of k r were supplemented more recently with the development of offshore wind farms monopiles with large diameter small length ratio and substantial flexural rigidity have been increasingly used table 5 summarized the parameters of available rigid pile tests in clay based on tables 4 and 5 typical parameter combinations were selected that were case 1 d 0 5 m e 1 0 m l d 60 k r 10 4 case 2 d 0 5 m e 1 0 m l d 15 k r 10 3 and case 3 d 1 5 m e 10 0 m l d 6 k r 0 5 and α 0 34 and e s u 200 were adopted in all the cases clearly the former two cases represent typical flexible piles and the latter one represents a typical rigid pile apart from analyses with the present p y curve corresponding analyses by the fe and the api p y curve were also performed as the rigid monopiles designed as offshore wind turbine foundation are governed by pile head rotation det norske veritas 2004 both load displacement and load rotation curves of lateral piles are demonstrated in fig 13 in general the results of present p y curve agreed with those of fe analysis under different parameter combinations while the results of api p y curve underestimate the pile response in varying degrees the normalized pile side modulus p u l s u a v p d l s u a v u d at u 0 001 d is used to evaluate the initial response of lateral piles for the typical flexible pile cases the differences of initial response between the present p y curve and fe results are within 2 0 while results of the api p y curve generally underestimate the fe results by around 55 0 for the typical rigid pile the difference of initial response obtained by the present p y curve and fe analysis is 6 5 and the underestimation of the api p y curve results to those of fe analysis is increased to around 85 0 which is in accordance with the finding of byrne et al 2017 that the api p y curve tends to underestimate the initial lateral responses of rigid piles such incapability of the api p y curve in rigid pile analysis might be attributed to its extrapolated application far beyond the original field test database in terms of ultimate lateral bearing capacity the maximum load within the analysis range is taken as the bearing capacity of the flexible pile while the bearing capacity of rigid pile is assumed to be achieved at pile head rotation of 0 5 for the flexible piles the differences between bearing capacity results by the present p y curve and fe results are within 10 0 while results of the api p y curve underestimate the fe results by around 22 0 as for the rigid pile the bearing capacity results of the present and api p y curves are 20 8 and 71 0 less than the fe analysis result respectively the bearing capacity underestimation by the api p y curve for flexible pile might be attributed to the conservative assumption of a smooth pile soil interface yet the extreme underestimation indicates that the api p y curve is not applicable for rigid piles the bearing capacity difference between the present p y curve and fe analysis for the rigid pile might be attribute to the fact that pile bottom kick out phenomenon is observed in the fe simulation which is not considered in the bearing capacity profile adopted in the present p y curve 6 conclusions a framework to consider three dimensional effects including the ultimate pile capacity pile compatibility and initial subgrade modulus in the t emsd based p y curve of laterally loaded pile in undrained clay is presented to verify the ultimate pile lateral bearing capacity design equation centrifuge experiments of rigid fix head piles under lateral translation were designed and performed in nc clay the present limiting loads on pile head were compared to calculated results by the design equation for pile ultimate lateral capacity and fe analysis analyses were also made for previous tests with different length ratios which indicate that the results by the design equation and fe analysis are close to those measured in the experiments the relationship between the pile compatibility factor and upper bound limiting load is established based on continuous fields therefore the measured ultimate pile lateral loads were used to determine the experimental pile compatibility factor and theoretical compatibility factor corresponding to a soil section was also proposed and calibrated by the experimental pile compatibility factor then the compatibility factor profile was adopted in the p y curve scaled from soil stress strain curve to consider the difference in mechanism mobilized at different depth finally the present p y curve was applied in centrifuge experiment simulation and parametric analysis analysis result indicates that the present p y curve provides pile response close to those of fe analysis and experiment results besides the present p y curve method always gives out more accurate prediction compared with the api p y curve method thus the present p y curve is recommended for the design of lateral pile in clay with relative pile soil rigidity factor from 10 4 to 0 5 although the form of the present p y approach is still very complex it has the merit of a clear theoretical basis and might shed light on the modification of the standard p y approach credit authorship contribution statement sen li methodology software investigation writing original draft visualization jian yu methodology software investigation maosong huang

21859,corrosion and cracking are two main reasons for failure of plates in ships and offshore structures in the current paper the ultimate strength of plates with pitting corrosion and a longitudinal crack is investigated under uniform in plane compression using non linear finite element method fem ultimate strength of cracked pitted plates are predicted using proper artificial neural network ann under different aspect ratio thickness of plate number of pits crack length and pit depth over thickness of the plate based on the numerical results in rectngular plates ultimate strength for pitted plate and cracked pitted plate are almost the same while in square plates when degree of pitting is low negligible effect of longitudinal crack on the ultimate strength is detected for thin plates less influence of pit corrosion on ultimate strength reduction is observed in comparison to thick plates also it is found that the arrangements of pits in the cracked pitted plates on ultimate strength reduction is more influential than number of the pits finally an equation is suggested to predict the ultimate strength of corroded plated with longitudinal crack using ann s weights and bias keywords artificial neural network plate pitting corrosion longitudinal crack finite element method ultimate strength 1 introduction ships and offshore structures are in expose of seawater environment which have high risk of corrosion moreover the cargos on board of oil tankers and bulk carriers may be highly corrosive corrosion may cause material degradation fatigue crack facilitation brittle fracture and unstable failure guedes soares et al 2008 up to now ultimate strength of intact plates is comprehensively evaluated using analytical methods cui et al 2002 paik and pedersen 1998 ueda and yao 1985 experimental tests chen et al 2004 dowling et al 1973 dwight and moxham 1969 faulkner 1977 smith 1975 empirical formulas faulkner 1975 frankland 1940 guedes soares and gordo 2002 and finite element method fem chaithanya et al 2010 cho et al 2013 fujikubo et al 1997 kim et al 2018 paik et al 2008 however the assessment of ultimate strength of a plate with defects is essential to life time expansion of aged structures nakai et al 2004 have studied the artificial pitting corrosion patterns by conducting compression tests on plates with different degree of pitting dop and found that the ultimate strength of corroded plate decreased by increasing dop paik et al 2003 and ok et al 2007a conducted a series of numerical tests using fem to investigate ultimate compressive strength of plate elements with pit corrosion and locally corroded wastage they observed that ultimate strength of a steel plate with pitting corrosion under edge shear depend on dop whereas ultimate strength of a pitted plate element under axial compressive loads depend on to the smallest cross section area of plate taken through the pitted region a series of fem simulation are done by rahbar ranji et al 2015 to investigate the strength of stiffened plates with pitting corrosion they found that ultimate strength of a plate is related to its thickness stiffeners type and size and dop shi et al 2018 suggested empirical formula to estimate ultimate strength of corroded stiffened plates based on their numerical data on the other hands one of the major parameters to failures of aged ships is fatigue cracks abs corporate technology 2012 paik et al 2005a investigated longitudinal cracking damage by studying a series of tensile and compressive tests on the plates with longitudinal cracking damage they proposed a simple model for predicting ultimate strength of a center or edge cracked plate under axial tensile compressive loads hu et al 2004 suggested some empirical formulae according to their fem analyses for calculating ultimate tensile compressive strength of stiffened panels and un stiffened plates with center and edge crack a simple approximate theoretical model for analysis of buckling phenomena in the cracked plates under tension compression is proposed by brighenti 2009 he considered different crack parameters under tension compression loadings bayatfar et al 2014 investigated buckling strength of cracked plates by fem they found that the size of crack as well as its location and orientation have remarkable impression on buckling behavior of plate paik 2009a numerically investigated transverse cracks in steel plates by fem he observed transverse cracks propagation under longitudinal axial tension and buckling under the axial compressive forces that resulted to lateral deflection of plates rahbar ranji and zarookian 2015 studied ultimate strength of steel stiffened plates with a transverse crack using fem they found that a transverse crack is more crucial in thick stiffened plates compared to thin plates they also observed that the edge crack has more significant effect on reduction of ultimate strength compared to centre crack ultimate strength of stiffened plates with transversely cracks under uni axial compression is numerically investigated by cui et al 2017 nowadays different forecasting methods such as artificial neural networks anns are developed to predict the input output of complex systems there are various works in context of using artificial neural networks anns in ocean engineering applications mahmoodi et al 2017 najafi et al 2018 nowruzi et al 2017a 2017b nowruzi and ghassemi 2016 shora et al 2018 in the case of using ann in prediction of structural performance of marine structures one can refer to the study conducted by wei and zhang 1999 they investigated ultimate strength of stiffened plates using ann and found high potential of ann in prediction of ultimate strength of stiffened plates compared to empirical formulae derived from the conventional regression analysis pu and mesbahi 2006 used ann to predict ultimate strength of un stiffened plates under uni axial compression by using neural networks nn and genetic programming gp cevik and guzelbey 2007 proposed some formulations for plate strength ok et al 2007b applied ann to predict ultimate strength reduction of locally corroded plates to our best of knowledge and based on the cited studies simultaneous effects of pit corrosion and cracks on ultimate strength reduction of a plate have not been studied moreover the lack of predictive equation to estimate ultimate strength of corroded plates with longitudinal crack under different physical and geometrical conditions is detectable therefore the major goal of the present paper is to study ultimate strength of one sided corroded plate having one longitudinal crack to this accomplishment a series of elasto plastic large deflection fea is performed on plates with pitting corrosion and center longitudinal crack at the plane longitudinal compression load under different aspect ratio thickness of plate crack length pit depth thickness of plate distance between crack tip and center of pit and number of pits in addition an equation is proposed to predict ultimate strength of considered corroded plate with center longitudinal crack under different geometrical and physical conditions using anns 2 physics of the problem and numerical procedure pitting corrosions have different geometrical morphology i e cylindrical conical semi sphere or ellipsoidal according to paik et al 2003 and zhang et al 2016 studies effects of geometrical morphology of a pit on strength reduction of a plate is negligible and they suggested cylindrical shape for pits maximum diameter of a localized corrosion is in range of 25 80 mm for marine immersion corrosion of steel diameter to the depth ratio of a corrosion pit for tanker bottom shells is between the 4 1 or 6 1 while diameter to the depth ratio of a corrosion pit for bulk carrier surface of the hold frames diameter to the depth ratio is between the 8 1 and 10 1 daidola et al 1997 in the current study diameter to depth ratio of pits is 10 depth of the pits is 2 mm and one sided corroded plate is considered it should be noted that in order to analyze strength of pitted plate the ratio percentage of the corroded surface area to the original plate surface area known as degree of pitting dop is used figure 1 indicates some plate with different dop commercial software ansys v 19 is employed to evaluate ultimate strength of cracked pitted plate in numerical analysis of thin structural members such as plate 2d shell or 3d solid elements can be used the selection between them depends on the goals of analysis accuracy and size of structure if the aim of study is to investigate local behavior of structures such as stress concentration around pit hole or any discontinuities definitely solid elements should be used however when a global behavior of structure such as buckling or ultimate strength is concerned depending on size of structure solid or shell elements is used there are some papers teixeira et al 2013 bin 2013 in which both shell and solid elements have been used to analyze buckling ultimate strength of corroded plates and results are compared this comparison shows that the difference between ultimate strength of the corroded plate determined by shell and solid elements is of the order of 0 5 for thick plates and of 1 7 for slender plates therefore it can be concluded that using shell elements for buckling ultimate strength analysis of plates is justified in this simulation shell 181 2d element with 4 nodes and 6 degrees of freedom at each node is considered shell elements in computer code ansys has this capability to define the position of nodes in respect to mid thickness of plate either at top bottom or center of plate in this investigation the position of each nodes are defined at the bottom of plate thus the whole thickness of plate would be positioned at the top of each node when the thickness is reduced due to pitting corrosion the pit is generated non symmetrically at one side of plate and mid plane of plate will dislocated and positioned at new mid thickness figures 2 and 3 shows cylindrical modeling of pits with uniform thickness reduction and a center crack longitudinal crack by two parallel lines with constant distance of 1 100 crack length is modeled moreover crack propagation is ignored to avoid complicated fracture mechanics phenomenon considered material is mild steel with young s modulus 209 gpa and yield stress 245 mpa and elastic perfectly plastic material four edges of the plate are simply supported and a uniform axial in plane force is applied at one end of the plate as may be seen in fig 3 the loaded edge and the other edges perpendicular to it are kept straight by coupling the residual stress is neglected and initial deflections of plate are modeled with a half sine wave with the maximum out of plane amplitude as follows smith et al 1988 1 w p 0 1 β 2 t where t is thickness of plate and β is plate slenderness ratio 2 1 1 mesh sensitivity analysis and validation study to ensure from mesh independency of numerical simulation mesh sensitivity analysis is conducted figure 4 shows ratio of ultimate stress to yield stress for a square intact plate with dimensions 0 6 0 6 0 01m for different number of elements as can be seen for number of elements greater than 120 mesh size equal to 0 005 mm the result remains constant figure 5 and figure 6 indicate the convergence study for cracked and pitted plate respectively as can be seen element size of 0 005 mm at the crack face and 0 002 mm at the perimeter of the circle is an appropriate selection therefore in further studies the sizes of mesh at the perimeter of pit is considered as 0 002 mm and at crack face and elsewhere are 0 005 mm to validate fem three empirical formulas guo et al 2008 table 1 are used to calculate ultimate strength of plates as a function of plate slenderness ratio figure 7 indicates comparison of ultimate strength of un corroded plate determined by fem with these formulas and good agreements have been achieved for plate with slenderness ratio less than 2 3 fem results are approximately the same as iacs s11 2006 the accuracy of fem for crack and pitted plate are validated with experiments paik 2008 paik et al 2003 figure 8 and good agreements between fe results and experiments have been observed corrosion in general and pitting in particular are random phenomena and shape size location and number of them are random variables crack parameters including its position length orientation relative distance to pits are also random variables in order to study ultimate strength of cracked pitted plate all these randomly varying parameters together with the dimensions of plate and mechanical properties of material should be considered it can be seen that number of analyses increases significantly and it would be very difficult to reach to a comprehensive conclusion therefore it very helpful to know the role of each parameter on reduction of ultimate strength it is the main aim of this study to determine quantitatively the effect of each involving parameter on ultimate strength reduction of cracked pitted plate using ann for this reason number of pits is limited to four with identical size and only longitudinal crack at the center of plate is considered literature review shows that some researchers have focused on longitudinal cracks paik et al 2005b some on transverse cracks cui et al 2017 and others on both therefore both transverse and longitudinal cracks are possible in this work only longitudinal crack which occurs in stiffened plates parallel to weld line of stiffeners is considered the steel plates with width 600 mm and length 600 1200 1800 and 2400 mm with aspect ratio ar 1 2 3 and 4 are considered table 2 summarize the considered parameters in this study in studying cracked structures under compressive force using fem the contact between two edges of crack which occurs in transverse cracks is a challenging problem to overcome it usually a minimum gap size is considered between two edges in such a way that even under maximum loading two edges never come to contact paik 2008 paik et al 2005 in contrast longitudinal cracks would be opened further under compressive 3 artificial neural network ann structure anns are recognized by their high ability in prediction of the output of complex systems anns are formed via three different layers i e input layer hidden layers and output layer where there is process unite i e neurons in each layer feed forward back propagation neural network is one of the most famous deep learning ann model which is used in the current study input layer of ann is the receiving terminal for outside evidence then these evidences will be transfer into the input variables via identity transfer function these data enter the hidden layer by interconnection among the input and hidden layers neurons the main calculation of anns is implemented in hidden layer through interconnected weights among hidden layers neurons summations of input layer output will be weighted in the hidden layer and then will be added by bias these summations cross through a transfer function in the current work we used hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function in hidden layer as follows 2 n j 2 1 e 2 z 1 where nj is the jth neuron of output and z will be defined as 3 z i 1 r ω i j p i b j here interconnection weight from ith neuron in previous layer to the jth neurons is shown by ω i j and p i is output of the ith neuron in addition r and b j are the number of previous layer neurons and the bias respectively in output layer we used linear transfer function λ as follows 4 g λ ω l z b o here interconnection weights among the last hidden layer and output layer is ω l and b o is representative of output layer bias learning algorithm of feed forward ann is according to feed forward training of the inputs back propagation of the associated errors and adjusting the weights and bias via transfer error from the previous layer this learning algorithm as back propagation bp procedure stochastic gradient descends method is presented by rumelhart et al 1986 for ann optimization offline training marquardt levenberg algorithm mla as damped least squares procedure is utilized in order to evaluate the efficiency of selected anns mean square errors mse and correlation coefficient r are used as follows 5 m s e i 1 n o i y d e s i r e d 2 n 6 r 1 i 1 n o i y d e s i r e d i 1 n o i y d e s i r e d here n is the number of evidence data y d e s i r e d is the number of reference data i e desired values o i and y d e s i r e d are predicted data i e actual values and average of desired values respectively in the present work 151 numerical data are used for database for anns limited values of input output variables of considered anns are shown in table 3 inputs outputs of numerical database are randomly classified to train data i e 60 of database validation data i e 20 of database and test data i e 20 of database sets we applied early stopping procedure proposed by prechelt 1998 in ann to overcome the over fitting because of various magnitudes of input output values considered database is normalized in interval of 0 1 0 9 as follows 7 φ n 0 8 φ min φ max φ min φ 0 1 here normalized input is shown by φ n two major parameters for choosing an appropriate anns are number of hidden layers and number of hidden neurons on one hand increasing the number of hidden layers will because to higher computational costs and sometimes will be resulted to over fitting so in practice anns with one or two hidden layer are interested and they have well performance choi et al 2008 trenn 2008 zhang et al 2003 therefore the current study we used two hidden layers ann on the other hands there are various methodologies to select proper number of hidden neurons choi et al 2008 trenn 2008 while an appropriate number of hidden neurons significantly related to errors of ann output and experimentation for choosing a proper ann to predict the ultimate strength to yield stress ratio of corroded plates with longitudinal crack an iterative algorithm is suggested see appendix b please see the detail concept of this algorithm in shora et al 2018 as may be seen in figure 9 based on the proposed algorithm an appropriate ann is selected with two hidden layers with architecture of 6 7 5 1 4 results and discussion in the current section the numerical results of ultimate strength to yield stress ratio of corroded plates with longitudinal crack under different aspect ratio ar thickness of plate top crack length cl number of pits nop pit depth thickness of plate pd top and distance between crack tip and center of pit dcp are first evaluated afterward ann s results i e correlation diagrams predictive equation and weight sensitivity analysis are presented 4 1 numerical results preliminary the effect of pit and crack on the structural behavior of corroded plate with longitudinal cracks is investigated figure 10 indicates the distribution of von mises stresses in intact corroded cracked and cracked corroded square plates as may be seen addition of crack and pit will result to a significant change in distribution of stresses and the position of stress maximum figure 11 indicates the deflection shape at ultimate stage in intact corroded cracked and cracked corroded square plates figure 12 present the effect of different aspect ratios on the relative compressive stress strain curve ultimate strength for intact plate cracked plate with a 50 mm longitudinal center crack pitted plate and cracked pitted plate as may be seen ultimate strength of deteriorated plates is significantly lower than the intact plate for square plates ultimate strength of deteriorated plates with pits is remarkably lower than the deteriorated plates with crack for plates with higher aspect ratios ultimate strength of pitted plate and cracked pitted plate are the same also it can be concluded that the detrimental effect of pitting on reduction of ultimate strength is more severe than the presence of a crack thus presence of crack in a pitted plate can be ignore effect of number of pits on the relative compressive stress strain curve for cracked pitted plates at two different plate aspect ratio ar 1 and ar 4 is shown in figure 13 as can be seen the relative compressive stress strain curves of cracked pitted plates with different number of pits are approximately the same for square plate ar 1 the cracked plate with three number of pits has the lowest ultimate strength while for rectangular plate ar 4 cracked plate with two pits has the lowest ultimate strength figure 14 indicates the relative compressive stress strain curves for a square cracked pitted plate with a pit and different crack length as can be seen the crack length has no influence on reduction of ultimate strength of cracked pitted plate which is due to position and orientations of crack paik 2009b and rahbar ranji and zarookian 2015 have reported that longitudinal cracks has little effect on ultimate strength reduction and in plate with transverse crack ultimate strength reduction in edge crack is more than center crack therefore it can be concluded that for center longitudinal cracks irrespective of crack length number of pits dop and position of pits in respect to crack there is no interaction between crack and pit in ultimate strength reduction figure 15 and figure 16 are presented to evaluate the effect of pit depth to thickness of plate ratio on ultimate strength reduction of cracked pitted square plates under different number of pits and crack length respectively as can be seen by increasing the ratio of pit depth to plate thickness ultimate strength reduction increases 4 2 ann results as stated before ann with architecture of 6 7 5 1 is designed to predict the ultimate strength to yield stress ratio of corroded plates with longitudinal crack under different aspect ratio ar thickness of plate top crack length cl number of pits nop pit depth thickness of plate pd top and distance between crack tip and center of pit dcp figure 17 shows the correlation diagrams of used data values and predicted ultimate strength to yield stress ratio for training validation test and all data sets as can be seen all data are located on the bisector that is representative of an appropriate correlation among the reference data with predicted output moreover maximum of mse and lowest value of correlation coefficient r are obtained 0 001237 and 0 95223 respectively used data and predicted outputs of selected ann for training data set validation data set test data set and all data sets are compared together in figure 18 as can be seen predicted outputs have good accordance with used data according to figs 17 and 18 one can be conclude that selected ann is appropriately able to predict the ultimate stress to yield stress ratio under different aspect ratio ar thickness of plate top crack length cl number of pits nop pit depth thickness of plate pd top and distance between crack tip and center of pit dcp therefore based on the ann weights and bias an equation is proposed to predict the ultimate stress to yield stress ratio under different considered geometrical and physical conditions as follows 8 σ u σ y 2 1 exp 2 h 1 here h has the following form 9 h j 1 5 ω j y j b k where y j has following form 10 y j 2 1 exp 2 i 1 7 ω i j 2 1 exp 2 a r ω a r i t o p ω t o p i c l ω c l i n o p ω n o p i p d t o p ω p d t o p i d c p ω d c p i b i 1 b j 1 constant values in eqs 9 and 10 are tabulated in table 4 one way to investigate the comparative importance of each input variables on the ann output is weight sensitivity analysis to this accomplishment matrixes of the adjusted weights in learning procedure as numerical parameters are used in the current paper partitioning the ann weights is used that this methodology is proposed by garson 1991 as follows 11 i j m 1 m n h ω j m i h k 1 n i ω k m i h ω m n h o k 1 k n i m 1 m n h ω k m i h k 1 k n i ω k m i h ω m n h o here the output of eq 11 indicates the comparative importance of each input on the output of ann ni and nh show the number of hidden layer inputs and neurons respectively input hidden and output layers are respectively shown via indices of i h and o moreover input hidden and output neurons are shown with indices of k m and n figure 19 indicates the comparative importance of the input variables ar top cl nop pd top and dcp the response variable of ultimate stress to yield stress ratio of corroded plates with longitudinal crack according to fig 19 the highest impression is observed for ar with relative importance percentage of 29 1 however nop with comparative importance percentage of 1 44 has the lowest effect on the ultimate stress to yield stress ratio 5 conclusion ultimate strength analysis of corroded plates with cracks is the essential input data for limit state design of ships and offshore structures geometrical and physical characteristics of plate corrosion and crack are influential parameters on ultimate strength of pitted cracked plate in the current study ultimate strength of corroded plates with center longitudinal crack under different aspect ratio thickness of plate number of pits crack length and pit depth over thickness of the plate are numerically examined by fem then an appropriate feed forward back propagation ann to predict the ultimate strength of considered plates is found using an iterative algorithm between the most important extracted findings in this paper are the following 1 at high aspect ratios ultimate strength of cracked plates is higher than the ultimate strength of pitted and the cracked pitted plates while ultimate strength of pitted plate and cracked pitted plates are approximately similar for ar 1 2 numerical results show the negligible effect of crack length enhancement on the ultimate strength reduction of cracked pitted plates 3 increasing the thickness of a plate is resulted to reduce of ultimate strength of cracked pitted plate pitting corrosions have less effect on ultimate strength reduction of thin plates where buckling control the ultimate strength compared to the thick plate where yielding control the ultimate strength 4 maximum mean square error mse and minimum of correlation coefficient r for considered ann in prediction of ultimate strength are achieved 0 001237 and 0 95223 respectively 5 based on the weight sensitivity analysis the highest impression is observed for aspect ratio ar with relative importance percentage of 29 1 however number of pits nop with comparative importance percentage of 1 44 has the lowest effect on ultimate strength 6 an equation according to the designed ann s weights and bias is suggested in order to predict the ultimate strength of corroded plated with longitudinal crack the present study deserves further investigation in the future evaluation of other soft computing approaches such as gmdh elm and anfis in prediction the ultimate strength of corroded plated with longitudinal can be intended in future studies funding body the authors received no financial support for the research authorship

less influence of pit corrosion on ultimate strength reduction is observed in comparison to thick plates also it is found that the arrangements of pits in the cracked pitted plates on ultimate strength reduction is more influential than number of the pits finally an equation is suggested to predict the ultimate strength of corroded plated with longitudinal crack using ann s weights and bias keywords artificial neural network plate pitting corrosion longitudinal crack finite element method ultimate strength 1 introduction ships and offshore structures are in expose of seawater environment which have high risk of corrosion moreover the cargos on board of oil tankers and bulk carriers may be highly corrosive corrosion may cause material degradation fatigue crack facilitation brittle fracture and unstable failure guedes soares et al 2008 up to now ultimate strength of intact plates is comprehensively evaluated using analytical methods cui et al 2002 paik and pedersen 1998 ueda and yao 1985 experimental tests chen et al 2004 dowling et al 1973 dwight and moxham 1969 faulkner 1977 smith 1975 empirical formulas faulkner 1975 frankland 1940 guedes soares and gordo 2002 and finite element method fem chaithanya et al 2010 cho et al 2013 fujikubo et al 1997 kim et al 2018 paik et al 2008 however the assessment of ultimate strength of a plate with defects is essential to life time expansion of aged structures nakai et al 2004 have studied the artificial pitting corrosion patterns by conducting compression tests on plates with different degree of pitting dop and found that the ultimate strength of corroded plate decreased by increasing dop paik et al 2003 and ok et al 2007a conducted a series of numerical tests using fem to investigate ultimate compressive strength of plate elements with pit corrosion and locally corroded wastage they observed that ultimate strength of a steel plate with pitting corrosion under edge shear depend on dop whereas ultimate strength of a pitted plate element under axial compressive loads depend on to the smallest cross section area of plate taken through the pitted region a series of fem simulation are done by rahbar ranji et al 2015 to investigate the strength of stiffened plates with pitting corrosion they found that ultimate strength of a plate is related to its thickness stiffeners type and size and dop shi et al 2018 suggested empirical formula to estimate ultimate strength of corroded stiffened plates based on their numerical data on the other hands one of the major parameters to failures of aged ships is fatigue cracks abs corporate technology 2012 paik et al 2005a investigated longitudinal cracking damage by studying a series of tensile and compressive tests on the plates with longitudinal cracking damage they proposed a simple model for predicting ultimate strength of a center or edge cracked plate under axial tensile compressive loads hu et al 2004 suggested some empirical formulae according to their fem analyses for calculating ultimate tensile compressive strength of stiffened panels and un stiffened plates with center and edge crack a simple approximate theoretical model for analysis of buckling phenomena in the cracked plates under tension compression is proposed by brighenti 2009 he considered different crack parameters under tension compression loadings bayatfar et al 2014 investigated buckling strength of cracked plates by fem they found that the size of crack as well as its location and orientation have remarkable impression on buckling behavior of plate paik 2009a numerically investigated transverse cracks in steel plates by fem he observed transverse cracks propagation under longitudinal axial tension and buckling under the axial compressive forces that resulted to lateral deflection of plates rahbar ranji and zarookian 2015 studied ultimate strength of steel stiffened plates with a transverse crack using fem they found that a transverse crack is more crucial in thick stiffened plates compared to thin plates they also observed that the edge crack has more significant effect on reduction of ultimate strength compared to centre crack ultimate strength of stiffened plates with transversely cracks under uni axial compression is numerically investigated by cui et al 2017 nowadays different forecasting methods such as artificial neural networks anns are developed to predict the input output of complex systems there are various works in context of using artificial neural networks anns in ocean engineering applications mahmoodi et al 2017 najafi et al 2018 nowruzi et al 2017a 2017b nowruzi and ghassemi 2016 shora et al 2018 in the case of using ann in prediction of structural performance of marine structures one can refer to the study conducted by wei and zhang 1999 they investigated ultimate strength of stiffened plates using ann and found high potential of ann in prediction of ultimate strength of stiffened plates compared to empirical formulae derived from the conventional regression analysis pu and mesbahi 2006 used ann to predict ultimate strength of un stiffened plates under uni axial compression by using neural networks nn and genetic programming gp cevik and guzelbey 2007 proposed some formulations for plate strength ok et al 2007b applied ann to predict ultimate strength reduction of locally corroded plates to our best of knowledge and based on the cited studies simultaneous effects of pit corrosion and cracks on ultimate strength reduction of a plate have not been studied moreover the lack of predictive equation to estimate ultimate strength of corroded plates with longitudinal crack under different physical and geometrical conditions is detectable therefore the major goal of the present paper is to study ultimate strength of one sided corroded plate having one longitudinal crack to this accomplishment a series of elasto plastic large deflection fea is performed on plates with pitting corrosion and center longitudinal crack at the plane longitudinal compression load under different aspect ratio thickness of plate crack length pit depth thickness of plate distance between crack tip and center of pit and number of pits in addition an equation is proposed to predict ultimate strength of considered corroded plate with center longitudinal crack under different geometrical and physical conditions using anns 2 physics of the problem and numerical procedure pitting corrosions have different geometrical morphology i e cylindrical conical semi sphere or ellipsoidal according to paik et al 2003 and zhang et al 2016 studies effects of geometrical morphology of a pit on strength reduction of a plate is negligible and they suggested cylindrical shape for pits maximum diameter of a localized corrosion is in range of 25 80 mm for marine immersion corrosion of steel diameter to the depth ratio of a corrosion pit for tanker bottom shells is between the 4 1 or 6 1 while diameter to the depth ratio of a corrosion pit for bulk carrier surface of the hold frames diameter to the depth ratio is between the 8 1 and 10 1 daidola et al 1997 in the current study diameter to depth ratio of pits is 10 depth of the pits is 2 mm and one sided corroded plate is considered it should be noted that in order to analyze strength of pitted plate the ratio percentage of the corroded surface area to the original plate surface area known as degree of pitting dop is used figure 1 indicates some plate with different dop commercial software ansys v 19 is employed to evaluate ultimate strength of cracked pitted plate in numerical analysis of thin structural members such as plate 2d shell or 3d solid elements can be used the selection between them depends on the goals of analysis accuracy and size of structure if the aim of study is to investigate local behavior of structures such as stress concentration around pit hole or any discontinuities definitely solid elements should be used however when a global behavior of structure such as buckling or ultimate strength is concerned depending on size of structure solid or shell elements is used there are some papers teixeira et al 2013 bin 2013 in which both shell and solid elements have been used to analyze buckling ultimate strength of corroded plates and results are compared this comparison shows that the difference between ultimate strength of the corroded plate determined by shell and solid elements is of the order of 0 5 for thick plates and of 1 7 for slender plates therefore it can be concluded that using shell elements for buckling ultimate strength analysis of plates is justified in this simulation shell 181 2d element with 4 nodes and 6 degrees of freedom at each node is considered shell elements in computer code ansys has this capability to define the position of nodes in respect to mid thickness of plate either at top bottom or center of plate in this investigation the position of each nodes are defined at the bottom of plate thus the whole thickness of plate would be positioned at the top of each node when the thickness is reduced due to pitting corrosion the pit is generated non symmetrically at one side of plate and mid plane of plate will dislocated and positioned at new mid thickness figures 2 and 3 shows cylindrical modeling of pits with uniform thickness reduction and a center crack longitudinal crack by two parallel lines with constant distance of 1 100 crack length is modeled moreover crack propagation is ignored to avoid complicated fracture mechanics phenomenon considered material is mild steel with young s modulus 209 gpa and yield stress 245 mpa and elastic perfectly plastic material four edges of the plate are simply supported and a uniform axial in plane force is applied at one end of the plate as may be seen in fig 3 the loaded edge and the other edges perpendicular to it are kept straight by coupling the residual stress is neglected and initial deflections of plate are modeled with a half sine wave with the maximum out of plane amplitude as follows smith et al 1988 1 w p 0 1 β 2 t where t is thickness of plate and β is plate slenderness ratio 2 1 1 mesh sensitivity analysis and validation study to ensure from mesh independency of numerical simulation mesh sensitivity analysis is conducted figure 4 shows ratio of ultimate stress to yield stress for a square intact plate with dimensions 0 6 0 6 0 01m for different number of elements as can be seen for number of elements greater than 120 mesh size equal to 0 005 mm the result remains constant figure 5 and figure 6 indicate the convergence study for cracked and pitted plate respectively as can be seen element size of 0 005 mm at the crack face and 0 002 mm at the perimeter of the circle is an appropriate selection therefore in further studies the sizes of mesh at the perimeter of pit is considered as 0 002 mm and at crack face and elsewhere are 0 005 mm to validate fem three empirical formulas guo et al 2008 table 1 are used to calculate ultimate strength of plates as a function of plate slenderness ratio figure 7 indicates comparison of ultimate strength of un corroded plate determined by fem with these formulas and good agreements have been achieved for plate with slenderness ratio less than 2 3 fem results are approximately the same as iacs s11 2006 the accuracy of fem for crack and pitted plate are validated with experiments paik 2008 paik et al 2003 figure 8 and good agreements between fe results and experiments have been observed corrosion in general and pitting in particular are random phenomena and shape size location and number of them are random variables crack parameters including its position length orientation relative distance to pits are also random variables in order to study ultimate strength of cracked pitted plate all these randomly varying parameters together with the dimensions of plate and mechanical properties of material should be considered it can be seen that number of analyses increases significantly and it would be very difficult to reach to a comprehensive conclusion therefore it very helpful to know the role of each parameter on reduction of ultimate strength it is the main aim of this study to determine quantitatively the effect of each involving parameter on ultimate strength reduction of cracked pitted plate using ann for this reason number of pits is limited to four with identical size and only longitudinal crack at the center of plate is considered literature review shows that some researchers have focused on longitudinal cracks paik et al 2005b some on transverse cracks cui et al 2017 and others on both therefore both transverse and longitudinal cracks are possible in this work only longitudinal crack which occurs in stiffened plates parallel to weld line of stiffeners is considered the steel plates with width 600 mm and length 600 1200 1800 and 2400 mm with aspect ratio ar 1 2 3 and 4 are considered table 2 summarize the considered parameters in this study in studying cracked structures under compressive force using fem the contact between two edges of crack which occurs in transverse cracks is a challenging problem to overcome it usually a minimum gap size is considered between two edges in such a way that even under maximum loading two edges never come to contact paik 2008 paik et al 2005 in contrast longitudinal cracks would be opened further under compressive 3 artificial neural network ann structure anns are recognized by their high ability in prediction of the output of complex systems anns are formed via three different layers i e input layer hidden layers and output layer where there is process unite i e neurons in each layer feed forward back propagation neural network is one of the most famous deep learning ann model which is used in the current study input layer of ann is the receiving terminal for outside evidence then these evidences will be transfer into the input variables via identity transfer function these data enter the hidden layer by interconnection among the input and hidden layers neurons the main calculation of anns is implemented in hidden layer through interconnected weights among hidden layers neurons summations of input layer output will be weighted in the hidden layer and then will be added by bias these summations cross through a transfer function in the current work we used hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function in hidden layer as follows 2 n j 2 1 e 2 z 1 where nj is the jth neuron of output and z will be defined as 3 z i 1 r ω i j p i b j here interconnection weight from ith neuron in previous layer to the jth neurons is shown by ω i j and p i is output of the ith neuron in addition r and b j are the number of previous layer neurons and the bias respectively in output layer we used linear transfer function λ as follows 4 g λ ω l z b o here interconnection weights among the last hidden layer and output layer is ω l and b o is representative of output layer bias learning algorithm of feed forward ann is according to feed forward training of the inputs back propagation of the associated errors and adjusting the weights and bias via transfer error from the previous layer this learning algorithm as back propagation bp procedure stochastic gradient descends method is presented by rumelhart et al 1986 for ann optimization offline training marquardt levenberg algorithm mla as damped least squares procedure is utilized in order to evaluate the efficiency of selected anns mean square errors mse and correlation coefficient r are used as follows 5 m s e i 1 n o i y d e s i r e d 2 n 6 r 1 i 1 n o i y d e s i r e d i 1 n o i y d e s i r e d here n is the number of evidence data y d e s i r e d is the number of reference data i e desired values o i and y d e s i r e d are predicted data i e actual values and average of desired values respectively in the present work 151 numerical data are used for database for anns limited values of input output variables of considered anns are shown in table 3 inputs outputs of numerical database are randomly classified to train data i e 60 of database validation data i e 20 of database and test data i e 20 of database sets we applied early stopping procedure proposed by prechelt 1998 in ann to overcome the over fitting because of various magnitudes of input output values considered database is normalized in interval of 0 1 0 9 as follows 7 φ n 0 8 φ min φ max φ min φ 0 1 here normalized input is shown by φ n two major parameters for choosing an appropriate anns are number of hidden layers and number of hidden neurons on one hand increasing the number of hidden layers will because to higher computational costs and sometimes will be resulted to over fitting so in practice anns with one or two hidden layer are interested and they have well performance choi et al 2008 trenn 2008 zhang et al 2003 therefore the current study we used two hidden layers ann on the other hands there are various methodologies to select proper number of hidden neurons choi et al 2008 trenn 2008 while an appropriate number of hidden neurons significantly related to errors of ann output and experimentation for choosing a proper ann to predict the ultimate strength to yield stress ratio of corroded plates with longitudinal crack an iterative algorithm is suggested see appendix b please see the detail concept of this algorithm in shora et al 2018 as may be seen in figure 9 based on the proposed algorithm an appropriate ann is selected with two hidden layers with architecture of 6 7 5 1 4 results and discussion in the current section the numerical results of ultimate strength to yield stress ratio of corroded plates with longitudinal crack under different aspect ratio ar thickness of plate top crack length cl number of pits nop pit depth thickness of plate pd top and distance between crack tip and center of pit dcp are first evaluated afterward ann s results i e correlation diagrams predictive equation and weight sensitivity analysis are presented 4 1 numerical results preliminary the effect of pit and crack on the structural behavior of corroded plate with longitudinal cracks is investigated figure 10 indicates the distribution of von mises stresses in intact corroded cracked and cracked corroded square plates as may be seen addition of crack and pit will result to a significant change in distribution of stresses and the position of stress maximum figure 11 indicates the deflection shape at ultimate stage in intact corroded cracked and cracked corroded square plates figure 12 present the effect of different aspect ratios on the relative compressive stress strain curve ultimate strength for intact plate cracked plate with a 50 mm longitudinal center crack pitted plate and cracked pitted plate as may be seen ultimate strength of deteriorated plates is significantly lower than the intact plate for square plates ultimate strength of deteriorated plates with pits is remarkably lower than the deteriorated plates with crack for plates with higher aspect ratios ultimate strength of pitted plate and cracked pitted plate are the same also it can be concluded that the detrimental effect of pitting on reduction of ultimate strength is more severe than the presence of a crack thus presence of crack in a pitted plate can be ignore effect of number of pits on the relative compressive stress strain curve for cracked pitted plates at two different plate aspect ratio ar 1 and ar 4 is shown in figure 13 as can be seen the relative compressive stress strain curves of cracked pitted plates with different number of pits are approximately the same for square plate ar 1 the cracked plate with three number of pits has the lowest ultimate strength while for rectangular plate ar 4 cracked plate with two pits has the lowest ultimate strength figure 14 indicates the relative compressive stress strain curves for a square cracked pitted plate with a pit and different crack length as can be seen the crack length has no influence on reduction of ultimate strength of cracked pitted plate which is due to position and orientations of crack paik 2009b and rahbar ranji and zarookian 2015 have reported that longitudinal cracks has little effect on ultimate strength reduction and in plate with transverse crack ultimate strength reduction in edge crack is more than center crack therefore it can be concluded that for center longitudinal cracks irrespective of crack length number of pits dop and position of pits in respect to crack there is no interaction between crack and pit in ultimate strength reduction figure 15 and figure 16 are presented to evaluate the effect of pit depth to thickness of plate ratio on ultimate strength reduction of cracked pitted square plates under different number of pits and crack length respectively as can be seen by increasing the ratio of pit depth to plate thickness ultimate strength reduction increases 4 2 ann results as stated before ann with architecture of 6 7 5 1 is designed to predict the ultimate strength to yield stress ratio of corroded plates with longitudinal crack under different aspect ratio ar thickness of plate top crack length cl number of pits nop pit depth thickness of plate pd top and distance between crack tip and center of pit dcp figure 17 shows the correlation diagrams of used data values and predicted ultimate strength to yield stress ratio for training validation test and all data sets as can be seen all data are located on the bisector that is representative of an appropriate correlation among the reference data with predicted output moreover maximum of mse and lowest value of correlation coefficient r are obtained 0 001237 and 0 95223 respectively used data and predicted outputs of selected ann for training data set validation data set test data set and all data sets are compared together in figure 18 as can be seen predicted outputs have good accordance with used data according to figs 17 and 18 one can be conclude that selected ann is appropriately able to predict the ultimate stress to yield stress ratio under different aspect ratio ar thickness of plate top crack length cl number of pits nop pit depth thickness of plate pd top and distance between crack tip and center of pit dcp therefore based on the ann weights and bias an equation is proposed to predict the ultimate stress to yield stress ratio under different considered geometrical and physical conditions as follows 8 σ u σ y 2 1 exp 2 h 1 here h has the following form 9 h j 1 5 ω j y j b k where y j has following form 10 y j 2 1 exp 2 i 1 7 ω i j 2 1 exp 2 a r ω a r i t o p ω t o p i c l ω c l i n o p ω n o p i p d t o p ω p d t o p i d c p ω d c p i b i 1 b j 1 constant values in eqs 9 and 10 are tabulated in table 4 one way to investigate the comparative importance of each input variables on the ann output is weight sensitivity analysis to this accomplishment matrixes of the adjusted weights in learning procedure as numerical parameters are used in the current paper partitioning the ann weights is used that this methodology is proposed by garson 1991 as follows 11 i j m 1 m n h ω j m i h k 1 n i ω k m i h ω m n h o k 1 k n i m 1 m n h ω k m i h k 1 k n i ω k m i h ω m n h o here the output of eq 11 indicates the comparative importance of each input on the output of ann ni and nh show the number of hidden layer inputs and neurons respectively input hidden and output layers are respectively shown via indices of i h and o moreover input hidden and output neurons are shown with indices of k m and n figure 19 indicates the comparative importance of the input variables ar top cl nop pd top and dcp the response variable of ultimate stress to yield stress ratio of corroded plates with longitudinal crack according to fig 19 the highest impression is observed for ar with relative importance percentage of 29 1 however nop with comparative importance percentage of 1 44 has the lowest effect on the ultimate stress to yield stress ratio 5 conclusion ultimate strength analysis of corroded plates with cracks is the essential input data for limit state design of ships and offshore structures geometrical and physical characteristics of plate corrosion and crack are influential parameters on ultimate strength of pitted cracked plate in the current study ultimate strength of corroded plates with center longitudinal crack under different aspect ratio thickness of plate number of pits crack length and pit depth over thickness of the plate are numerically examined by fem then an appropriate feed forward back propagation ann to predict the ultimate strength of considered plates is found using an iterative algorithm between the most important extracted findings in this paper are the following 1 at high aspect ratios ultimate strength of cracked plates is higher than the ultimate strength of pitted and the cracked pitted plates while ultimate strength of pitted plate and cracked pitted plates are approximately similar for ar 1 2 numerical results show the negligible effect of crack length enhancement on the ultimate strength reduction of cracked pitted plates 3 increasing the thickness of a plate is resulted to reduce of ultimate strength of cracked pitted plate pitting corrosions have less effect on ultimate strength reduction of thin plates where buckling control the ultimate strength compared to the thick plate where yielding control the ultimate strength 4 maximum mean square error mse and minimum of correlation coefficient r for considered ann in prediction of ultimate strength are achieved 0 001237 and 0 95223 respectively 5 based on the weight sensitivity analysis the highest impression is observed for aspect ratio ar with relative importance percentage of 29 1 however number of pits nop with comparative importance percentage of 1 44 has the lowest effect on ultimate strength 6 an equation according to the designed ann s weights and bias is suggested in order to predict the ultimate strength of corroded plated with longitudinal crack the present study deserves further investigation in the future evaluation of other soft computing approaches such as gmdh elm
