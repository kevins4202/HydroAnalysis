10120,when using subsurface drip irrigation sdi to grow field crops concerns may exist for water availability to plants because emitters and plants cannot be lined up perfectly the spatial distribution of water around sdi emitters is largely determined by soil hydraulic properties and characteristics of root water uptake rwu experiments were performed in an indoor facility to quantify the effects of alfalfa rwu on characteristics of wetting patterns in three soil textures in all soils the majority of rwu took place in a layer below the emitters where soil moisture was most dynamic unique wetting patterns developed in the three soils in response to irrigation events however when irrigation applications were aimed to replace potential evapotranspiration these unique patterns disappeared within 24 hr when irrigation was supplied in excess for a 21 d period an effective wetted zone developed over time both the extent of and moisture distribution within the wetted zone varied between the three soil textures an analysis of spatial moments showed that the moisture plume characteristics stabilized within seven days of irrigation and rwu zones of effective drying were observed in all three soils during the 21 d period the alfalfa crop was not negatively affected by the presence of these zones because compensatory rwu was concentrated around the sdi emitters the results of these experiments imply that the design of sdi line spacing can be less focused on soil type when root system size is considered this does require the presence of sufficient early season moisture for the crop to develop a complete root system keywords root water uptake spatial moment analysis experimental hillslope 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a water efficient technology popular for the irrigation of high value fruit and vegetable crops in semi arid regions while long considered un economical for lower value field cropping sdi is increasingly being adopted for the growth of row crops in the great plains region of the usa and canada evett et al 2014 alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 in sdi systems water is pressurized in regularly spaced driplines with passive emitters to deliver water directly into the rootzone which largely eliminates interception and evaporation losses the redistribution of water around emitters is the three dimensional outcome of interactions between flow rate and volume soil hydraulic properties and plant water uptake characteristics assouline 2002 the goals of sdi water management are to promote lateral and upward water movement and to minimize leaching from the rootzone by keeping soils at the right moisture levels lamm and camp 2006 when used for growing row crops it is not possible to line up driplines and emitters with individual rows and plants concerns therefore exist that the non uniform wetting pattern that is a characteristic of sdi systems may result in water stress and lower yields for plant rows positioned further away from the driplines murley et al 2018 the impact of soil hydraulic properties on wetting patters around sdi emitters can be expressed in terms of geometry of the wetted zone plume and the distribution of soil moisture within it for a known volume of water applied with a subsurface irrigation method the extent of the wetted zone increases with larger unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k u of the soil ashrafi et al 2002 this implies smaller wetted zones in low permeability soils such as loams or clays than in high permeability soils such as sands ashrafi et al 2002 cote et al 2003 kanda et al 2020 as well as smaller wetted zones in drier soils than in wetter soils of the same texture skaggs et al 2010 the shape of the wetted zone is also affected by k u with coarser or wetter soils featuring a smaller ratio between width and height of the wetted area than finer or drier soils cote et al 2003 kanda et al 2020 soulis et al 2015 in addition placement of emitters close to the soil surface e g 0 15 m or less may result in larger width to height ratios because of the barrier effect of the soil surface to upward movement kandelous and šimůnek 2010 skaggs et al 2010 a variety of models is available for the analysis of the geometry of soil wetting patterns semi empirical infiltration models for point sources e g schwartzman and zur model 1986 and wetup cook et al 2003 determine the wetted perimeter as a function of emitter flow rate irrigation volume and soil hydraulic properties such as saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s or macroscopic capillary length two or three dimensional numerical models e g elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 and hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2008 solve equations for unsaturated flow on a grid and are able to simulate moisture dynamics resulting from irrigation and root water uptake in more complex soil profiles semi empirical models are practical tools to inform effective and economic spacing of emitters and driplines while numerical models are required when investigating the distribution of moisture around drippers in layered soils soulis and elmaloglou 2018 or when performing multi criteria optimization of system design and crop water management kandelous et al 2012 seidel et al 2015 for soils of varying k u it is not just the extent of a wetted zone that varies but also the spatial distribution of water within the zone an analysis of spatial moments can be used to quantify such distributions yeh et al 2005 analyses of moments of experimental and simulated data of sub surface drip irrigation in sand loam and sandy loam soils have shown that the vertical properties of moisture distributions are affected more by soil texture than the lateral properties lazarovitch et al 2007 sperling and lazarovitch 2010 other numerical simulations of water distribution around surface and subsurface drip emitters have aimed to find the most representative soil moisture region within the rootzone these simulations indicated that representative locations could be found at similar lateral distances but varying depths with respect to emitters in different soil types soulis and elmaloglou 2016 such results have practical applications for the placement of soil moisture sensors to inform irrigation water management soulis et al 2015 successful practical applications however cannot be developed without taking into account the spatial distributions of roots and root water uptake rwu the location of a main water source e g surface sprinkling subsurface drip or capillary rise with respect to plant location influences the spatial distribution of a crop s root system coelho and or 1999 phene et al 1991 reyes cabrera et al 2016 even so rwu is more dynamic and adaptive than root density distribution itself plants invoke compensatory water uptake when subjected to non uniform distributions of water head jarvis 2011 javaux et al 2013 while sometimes thought of as a response to water stress in parts of the root system hopmans and bristow 2002 compensatory uptake can be observed under wetter conditions coelho and or 1999 skaggs et al 2004 phene et al 1991 as a broader passive response to variability of water head gradient over the root soil interface javaux et al 2013 under sdi conditions rwu has been shown to be highly heterogeneous and responsive especially where natural rainfall or other water sources are present in addition to the irrigation system albasha et al 2015 mubarak et al 2009 reyes cabrera et al 2016 rwu will impact the development and longevity of wetted zones around emitters especially when irrigation applications are performed at low flow rates and in small volumes the effects of the dynamics of rwu on the characteristics of wetted zones in different soil textures are poorly quantified to date here we present the results of experiments in which the wetting patterns around sdi emitters were investigated for three different soils with an alfalfa crop the experiments were performed indoors in three large soil bins that feature artificial soil profiles constructed of clay loam cl loamy sand ls and clay c materials native to southern alberta canada the facility provides an opportunity to perform year round sdi studies on field crops our research questions were 1 what are rwu patterns of an alfalfa crop around sdi micro drippers in three soil textural classes 2 what are the characteristics of wetting patterns in three soil textural classes when subjected to an irrigation schedule based on calculated water demand of the growing alfalfa crop we placed soil moisture sensors around sdi emitters for a spatiotemporal analysis of root water uptake and short term and long term wetting dynamics including an analysis of moments 2 methods 2 1 experimental soil bins the experimental setup consisted of three large bins 6 3 3 3 1 2 m l x w x h each containing a 0 9 m artificial soil profile the bottom panel of the bins was flat but a weeping tile drain was positioned at a 1 angle to allow outflow during saturated conditions the soil profiles in the bins were created from agricultural topsoil obtained from three locations in southern alberta selected for their general differences in soil texture and soil hydraulic properties table 1 topsoil material was placed into the bins with a skid steer loader and packed into 0 10 m layers with a walk behind a detailed description of soil profile construction and analysis of the soil hydraulic properties can be found in karimi and appels 2021 alfalfa medicago sativa l was selected as experimental crop for its deep root system and high crop water needs seed was distributed at a rate of 25 kg ha 1 and covered with 0 01 m of pulverized soil material germination was promoted with overhead irrigation with a handheld wand sprayer these overhead irrigations were stopped when the plants reached a 0 04 0 05 m height plant establishment in the c bin was poor most likely due to the abundance of cracks and macropores in this soil the top 0 05 m layer of this soil was mixed with peat sod material to improve establishment the extent of the rooting system was monitored through the transparent polycarbonate panel in each bin roots were observed at 0 90 m depth five months after seeding in keeping with agronomic practices for alfalfa hay the crop was cut every six to eight weeks after it had reached maturity each individual plant would regrow to a height of 0 20 0 25 m within ten days after fifteen days the plants reached a height of 0 40 0 50 m and the canopy covered the soil surface completely again 2 2 subsurface drip irrigation four sdi systems were installed in each bin with different line depths and emitter spacings and the same line spacing table 2 the two systems at 0 30 m depth were installed in an alternating manner for a resulting distance of 0 5 m between individual driplines fig 1 the two systems at 0 20 m depth were also installed in an alternating manner with an offset of 0 25 m compared to the systems below to avoid emitters being positioned in the same vertical line fig 2 overlap of wetted zones generated by the different systems could not be prevented physically however only one system was operated at any time and a rest period of 65 hr or more was observed when irrigation was switched from one system to another all sdi driplines featured typhoon non pressure compensating emitters netafim irrigation inc fresno ca usa each system was operated at a pressure of 10 psi resulting in an emitter flow rate of 0 12 10 3 l s 1 the sdi systems were operated with an nmc junior pro controller netafim irrigation inc fresno ca usa with each bin set up as one zone a 1 8 m wooden frame was constructed over the bins to mount lights and data loggers indoor construction allows for year long operation and multiple growth cycles per year which could otherwise not be achieved in the canadian prairie region 2 3 soil moisture measurements and characterization of soil moisture distribution in each soil bin 10hs capacitance probes meter group pullman wa usa and tdr315 l time domain reflectometers acclima inc kimberly id usa were installed to monitor vwc at multiple depths and various distances from the sdi emitters for the duration of the experiments at 5 minute intervals fourteen sensors formed a vertical cross section around the central emitter of one line of each of the sdi systems fig 2a twelve sensors formed a horizontal cross section at 0 10 m below the soil surface fig 2b four sensors were part of both the vertical and horizontal cross section the 10hs and tdr315 l probes were calibrated for the three soils with a volumetric gravimetric method vaz et al 2013 the readings by the tdr315 l probes did not require a correction when installed in the three soils the readings by the 10hs probes exhibited a 0 03 0 04 m3 m 3 error in the vwc range of 0 15 0 25 m3 m 3 soil specific quadratic equations were fitted to the data and these equations were applied to the 10hs probe readings before analysis karimi and appels 2021 for analysis the vwc readings at a designated time or the change in vwc over a designated time period δvwc were interpolated to a two dimensional surface with the inverse distance weighting function idw from the gstat package in r statistical software r core team 2019 pebesma 2004 gräler et al 2016 2 4 environmental settings environmental conditions in the experimental facility were regulated by a heat recovery ventilator hrv system that served the main 6000 m3 experimental space and three nearby offices the facility and its hrv system were originally designed as educational space and environmental conditions varied consistently between weekdays and weekend days each bin received light from six 40 w fluorescent tube lights gro lux sylvania and three 1000 w high pressure sodium lamps greenpower xtra philips mounted to a wooden frame at 1 8 m above the soil surface in the bins the air temperature relative humidity incoming radiation and wind speed in the experimental facility were monitored at a 5 minute time step the observations were aggregated to an hourly time step and reference evapotranspiration et rs was calculated according to the penman monteith fao 56 method allen 1998 1 et rs 0 408 r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s o e a γ 1 c d

the crop s potential evapotranspiration pet according to 2 pet k c et rs for a mature crop we assigned k c 1 while in the establishment period and after crop cuts we assigned k c 0 33 allen et al 2005 during regrow periods k c was linearly interpolated against time between these two values on weekdays the average air temperature was 20 0 74 c fig 3a with an average rh of 40 9 3 fig 3b the air velocity around the bins varied between 0 1 and 0 7 m s 1 due to variability of the unit flow rate of the hrv and the uneven distribution of air vents in the experimental facility the lights provided incoming radiation r a of 50 3 4 w m 2 at the top of the canopy fig 3c the pattern of hourly et rs reflected the day and week dynamics of the environmental variables fig 3d when operated on a daily schedule of 18 hr light and 6 hr dark photo period the average et rs was 3 4 0 78 mm d 1 on weekdays and 2 0 0 09 mm d 1 on weekend days these et rs values correspond to average alfalfa crop water demand in may and june in southern alberta alberta agriculture and forestry 2016 when operated on a 12 hr light and 12 hr dark photo period the average et rs was 2 3 mm d 1 on weekdays and 1 3 mm d 1 on weekend days 2 5 experiments 2 5 1 spatial distribution of root water uptake one month after the first cut of the alfalfa crop no irrigation was applied to the soil bins for a period of 27 days redistribution of water in the soil profile was negligible after two days and no signs of water stress were observed until day 26 we selected 21 days between redistribution and crop water stress to determine total and daily root water uptake from the vwc observations in the vertical and horizontal profiles fig 2 of each bin under the assumption that any changes in vwc during the drying period were caused by root water uptake the normalized root water uptake was determined from a two dimensional interpolated surface with eq 3 coelho and or 1999 3 u x z t u x z t x z u x z t where u is the normalized root water uptake and u is the cumulative root water uptake or vwc change m3 m 3 in a grid cell with midpoint coordinates x and z during a time period of length t total root water uptake in the bins in mm h2o was calculated by extrapolating the δvwc from the cross sections the observations were assumed to be representative for a 0 15 m layer in y direction and a 0 3 m layer in z direction in the vertical and horizontal cross sections respectively 2 5 2 wetting patterns during alfalfa regrowth after the fifth cut of the alfalfa crop irrigation applications were provided at 2 3 d intervals to the regrowing crop the total amount of irrigation during the 15 d period of interest covered the estimated pet section 2 3 with a small excess of 1 7 mm 6 table 3 the antecedent moisture conditions around the sdi emitters was on average 50 relative saturation in the cl and ls bins and 62 relative saturation in the c bin table 3 for every irrigation application the maximum δvwc and δvwc one day 24 hr after the start of the application were determined for every sensor in the vertical profile the data were interpolated to a two dimensional surface the maximum and 24 hr width w and height h of the wetted profile were determined from these surfaces by contouring the area where δvwc 0 01 m3 m 3 the residual amount of water in the profile 24 hr after the start of the irrigation event was determined by extrapolating the 24 hr δvwc over a 0 15 m soil layer in y direction the difference between maximum and 24 hr geometry of the wetted area and the residual soil moisture mm h2o in the vertical profile after each event were evaluated as a function of time passed since biomass removal 2 5 3 wetting pattern stability and dynamics during a 21 d period after the fourth cut of the alfalfa crop daily irrigation applications were applied with the 24 8 sdi system to provide the regrowing crop with sufficient water to meet pet the daily application volume was increased with time from 2 4 mm d 1 to 3 7 mm d 1 to adapt to the increasing pet during the regrowth period controller issues caused a 2 d and 3 d irrigation gap in the first and third week of regrowth respectively in both cases manual control was taken of sdi systems and 1 8 mm d 1 applied with the 24 8 system in total 91 hr of irrigation provided 55 5 mm of water to the bins to meet an estimated pet of 50 8 mm with a margin of 4 7 mm or 9 the wetting pattern that developed during the 21 d period was analyzed through interpolation of the vwc data in a horizontal and vertical cross section section 2 3 the stability of the wetting pattern during the 21 d period was investigated with an analysis of spatial moments of the water plume around the active sdi emitter the three dimensional spatial moments of a water plume were determined according to yeh et al 2005 4 m ijk t θ diff x y z t x i y j z k d x d y d z where θ diff x y z t θ x y z t θ ini x y z t is the difference in water content at time t and a given location x y z and the initial water content θ at the same location the zeroth first and second spatial moments correspond to i j k 0 1 or 2 respectively the zeroth moment m 000 is the total volume of water applied to the monitored domain the first moments m 100 m 010 and m 001 lead to the location of the centre of the wetting area with the coordinates of the centre of mass x c y c z c given by 5 x c m 100 m 000 y c m 010 m 000 z c m 001 m 000 the second moments m 200 m 020 and m 002 quantify the spread of the plume around its average position when used to calculate the spatial variance in the x y and z direction σ2 x σ2 y and σ2 z respectively according to 6 σ x 2 m 200 m 000 x c 2 σ y 2 m 020 m 000 y c 2 σ z 2 m 002 m 000 z c 2 the positions of sensors in soil bins allowed for determination of moments in a two dimensional area only x and z direction spatial moments analysis has previously been used on surface and subsurface drip irrigation problems in simulations lazarovitch et al 2007 and irrigation lab and field experiments skaggs et al 2010 sperling and lazarovitch 2010 xiong et al 2012 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of root water uptake from visual observations of root penetration we inferred that the alfalfa was able to access soil moisture in any location of the soil profiles provided local conditions were above wilting point fig 4 shows the patterns of normalized root water uptake u in the vertical cross section of each bin at the end of the 21 d drying period the spatial pattern of u was most uniform in the ls bin while that in the c bin was most heterogeneous in all three bins the maximum of u was located at 0 40 m below the soil surface 0 10 or 0 20 m below the four sdi systems the cl and ls bins featured a single maximum u location at this depth fig 4a and b while the c bin featured three local maximum locations fig 4c the maximum of u was located within a radius of 0 3 m of the emitters of the 24 12 system cl the 30 8 24 12 and 24 8 systems ls and the 30 12 30 8 24 12 systems c in the three weeks prior to the drying period irrigation applications had been performed with the 24 12 system cl and ls and with both the 24 12 and 30 12 system c the spatial distribution of u did not correspond to the spatial distribution of average vwc v w c during the drying period fig 5 the largest values of u were found in the 0 26 0 29 m3 m 3 cl 0 22 0 27 m3 m 3 ls 0 37 0 43 m3 m 3 c vwc ranges while locations with v w c up to 0 35 0 32 0 47 m3 m 3 were observed in the respective bins these higher vwc values were found deeper in the rootzones at depths larger than 0 6 m below the soil surface during the drying period the estimated pet was 2 3 mm d 1 on weekdays and 1 3 mm d 1 on weekends section 2 4 the total rwu in the root zone profile during the drying period was 0 21 m3 m 3 d 1 in the cl bin 0 17 m3 m 3 d 1 in the ls bin and 0 1 m3 m 3 d 1 in the c bin table 4 shows the extrapolated daily rwu for each week in the drying period and the 21 d average the values of the horizontal profile sensors were not extrapolated to the entire root zone but only to the top 0 3 m soil layer a difference between pet estimated from environmental conditions and rwu determined from vwc observations was expected due to the heterogeneous wetting patterns in sdi systems and the layout of our sensor network however the differences in rwu between the bins and weeks in the drying period were larger than expected table 4 daily rwu was 35 higher in the cl bin than in the ls bin and 123 higher in the cl bin than in the c bin under the same environmental conditions daily rwu from the vertical profile was 94 cl 70 ls and 42 c of the estimated daily pet in all three bins rwu was higher in the first week than in the other two weeks of the drying period this may indicate that the decreasing vwc levels in the bins did restrict rwu during part of the drying period even though signs of water stress were not observed in all three bins daily rwu from the top 0 3 m of the soil profile was 15 of the daily rwu in the vertical cross section 3 2 wetting patterns during alfalfa regrowth the effects of the cutting of alfalfa biomass on wetting patterns in the three soil bins is illustrated in fig 6 the maximum extent of the wetted area in terms of its width w and height h was 0 46 0 03 m by 0 46 0 09 m for the cl bin 0 46 0 02 m by 0 60 0 11 m for the ls bin and 0 45 0 02 m by 0 56 0 02 m for the c bin cutting of the alfalfa biomass led to a temporary decrease in pet and root water uptake as a result the wetted area had only decreased by 0 05 m in h and w 24 hr after the start of the irrigation event fig 6a while the δvwc in the vertical profile was 4 11 mm after 24 hr fig 6b as the biomass regrew to full canopy the difference between maximum and 24 hr extent of the wetted area increased fig 6a and the 24 hr δvwc in the profile decreased fig 6b two weeks after the biomass cut a 7 hr irrigation application did not leave a wetted area in the ls bin after 24 h while in the cl and c bins the wetted area was reduced to less than 50 of its maximum extent the accompanying 24 h δvwc in the profile was reduced to 1 2 mm in the two week period we did not observe spatial differences in regrowth of plants along or between the driplines interestingly the crop needed some time to adjust its water uptake when a different sdi system was used for irrigation in a fully developed crop 29 d after biomass cut switching to a system that had not been used for 20 days resulted in a difference between maximum and 24 hr extent of the wetted area that was similar to the difference observed directly after the biomass cut fig 6c in a 4 d period the difference increased to values of 0 20 0 40 m similar to values observed 14 d after the biomass cut the 24 hr δvwc decreased from 7 11 to 2 3 mm fig 6d the final δvwc in the cl bin was higher than the final δvwc after the biomass cut 3 3 wetting pattern dynamics and stability during a 21 d period for the duration of the 21 d experimental period the 9 over irrigation resulted in increases of vwc at all depths in the three bins fig 7 the characteristics of the wetting response varied between the bins and with time within active wetted areas around the sdi emitter a vwc response could be distinguished for each event fig 7c outside this active area steady vwc increases were observed even though event responses were not e g c in fig 7a and b or cl in fig 7f where the soil was dry at the beginning of the experimental period the passing of the wetting front could lead to a change from one to the other response type cl in fig 7d soil heterogeneity affected these responses with both response types occurring concurrently at the same lateral distance from the active emitter ls in fig 7b the largest vwc changes were observed 0 20 0 40 m below the soil surface in all three bins with 21 d increases of 0 17 0 10 and 0 20 m3 m 3 in the cl ls c bins respectively vwc changes smaller than 0 02 m3 m 3 were observed at 0 55 m below the soil surface and deeper cl ls bins and in the top 0 20 m below the soil surface c bin the spatial distribution of vwc change at the end of the 21 d experimental period is presented in fig 8 for the shallow horizontal upper row and vertical lower row cross sections in the bins in the ls bin positive δvwc was more widespread and more uniformly distributed than in the cl and c bins in both the horizontal fig 8c and vertical fig 8d cross sections of the ls bin the δvwc patterns were almost symmetrical around the sdi emitter though the response types were not fig 7 negative δvwc was observed 0 10 m below the surface at 0 40 0 50 m distance laterally from the emitter in the cl and c bins the positive δvwc in the vertical cross sections was distributed in an approximate elliptical shape around and under the emitter fig 8b and f areas with negative δvwc were found deeper into the rootzone than in the ls bin in the horizontal cross sections positive δvwc was not found symmetrically around the emitter fig 8a and e indicating more soil hydraulic heterogeneity than in the ls bin we did not observe spatial differences in regrowth of plants along or between the driplines an analysis of moments was used to investigate the stability of the spatial distribution of vwc over the 21 d period during the experimental period the zeroth moment m 000 increased in all three bins as more water was applied to the domain than was taken up by the crop fig 9a temporary decreases were observed on the days the irrigation controller failed in the cl and c bins m 000 stabilized 16 18 days into the experimental period suggesting that irrigation and root water uptake were balancing each other in the ls bin m 000 increased more than in the cl and c bins after day 6 suggesting that a larger fraction of the applied volume of water was retained in the instrumented part of the rootzone than in other zones along the sdi lines the total irrigated volume during the 21 d period was 38 dm3 of which only 8 cl c and 16 ls was present in the instrumented profile at the end of the experimental period m 000 in the cl and c bins was close to the 9 excess irrigation provided to the alfalfa crop based on pet calculations the vertical coordinate of the center of mass z c derived from the first and zeroth moment by eq 5 was found below the emitter in all three bins at depths of 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m below the soil surface for the cl ls and c bins respectively at the end of the 21 day period fig 9b in the cl and ls bins z c moved deeper into the rootzone with time while in the c bin an initial decrease of z c was followed by a 0 06 m increase in the second and third week the ratio between spatial variance in the x and z direction σ2 x σ2 z increased with time in the ls bin while it decreased with time in the cl bin fig 9c in the ls bin the increase of the ratio was the result of σ2 x increasing more than σ2 z whereas in the cl bin σ2 x effectively decreased and σ2 z remained stable after an initial increase in the c bin σ2 x decreased during the first five days and increased during the last five days of the period while σ2 z remained stable results not shown contraction and expansion of the wetted area fluctuated more in lateral x direction than in vertical z direction in all bins however variability on a sub daily timescale was observed in the cl and c bins but not in the ls bin in the c bin the spatial variance in both x and z direction was affected by redistribution of water between irrigation events leading to negative values for integral in eq 4 with i j k 2 lazarovitch et al 2007 suggest this could be overcome by using background vwc instead of initial vwc to determine the spread of vwc with time however that approach can only be applied when investigating model simulations as such the σ2 x σ2 z ratio could not be successfully used to characterize vwc pattern development in the c bin beyond suggesting it was more heterogeneous than in the other two bins 4 discussion 4 1 what are rwu patterns of an alfalfa crop around sdi micro drippers in three soil textural classes the alfalfa root water uptake patterns observed in the three soils all peaked in a band between 0 3 and 0 5 m below the soil surface under the emitters of the sdi systems the level of variability of rwu varied between the three soils with the ls bin featuring the most homogeneous distribution of rwu while the cl and c bins featured a concentration of rwu under one and three emitters respectively fig 4 during irrigation periods soil moisture levels around and under the sdi emitters showed the largest fluctuations while soil moisture levels deeper in the profile increased more slowly fig 7 during the drying period rwu was higher in zones that were previously subjected to rapid moisture fluctuations than in zones that featured higher average soil moisture levels but less fluctuations fig 4 these observations are in agreement with field observations of maize crop under sdi conditions albasha et al 2015 root distribution was not believed to be a limiting factor for rwu root presence was confirmed qualitatively at all depths in the soil profiles section 2 1 the presence of multiple sdi systems at different depths and short 0 25 m alternating distances could have resulted in a broader root establishment than typical for a crop grown at a smaller row distance than dripline spacing however while root density distributions will develop in response to the location of a water source water is not the only driver of root density distribution and in field situations plant roots will develop beyond the direct sphere of influence of any sdi emitter coelho and or 1999 phene et al 1991 reyes cabrera et al 2016 the occurrence of maximum rwu in zones where vwc and water head were most dynamic instead of wetter less dynamic areas was in agreement with other studies on the compensatory nature of rwu albasha et al 2015 couvreur et al 2012 jarvis 2011 however our observations indicate that adapting root water uptake in response to a change of water source may not occur immediately during the drying period maximum rwu values were observed near the systems that were operated in the three weeks before the drying period in the clay loam and clay soils such a strong correlation was not observed in the loamy sand soil the switch to a different sdi system which had not been operated for more than 20 days previously for water appeared to take a day to generate a response by the fully mature alfalfa crop of the first regrowth experiment the first application through a new system resulted in similar wetted zone characteristics as an identical water application to a crop that had just been cut and had a much lower water demand two to four day rest periods did not induce a similar rwu delay this behaviour was observed in all three soils 4 2 what are the characteristics of wetting patterns in three soil textural classes when subjected to an irrigation schedule based on calculated water demand of the growing alfalfa crop the observations of wetted area dynamics during the 15 d regrow period illustrate the interaction between soil texture and its associated soil hydraulic properties and crop characteristics the irrigation applications during this period were aimed at meeting crop water demand with an irrigation frequency of once every two days the maximum extents of the wetted zone varied between the three soil bins with the c soil moving water preferentially downward through macropores the ls soil spreading water laterally and vertically and the cl soil retaining water in the shallow depths of the rootzone karimi and appels 2021 immediately after the alfalfa cut the crop water demand was low enough for these patterns to remain present 24 hr after the start of the irrigation event though no increase of the wetted area was observed as reported by skaggs et al 2010 in a surface drip system installed in bare soil as the crop regrew the effect of irrigation at the 24 hr mark decreased rapidly in all three soils after two weeks of growth water applications still generated different soil moisture responses in the three soils but the differences were no longer distinguishable after 24 hr this observation is in accordance with field and numerical experiments of pet based irrigation schedules at various application frequencies when using pet as a target for irrigation regular irrigation events provide a modest amount of water per event promoting root water uptake over leaching wang et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 because rwu and irrigation occur at similar timescales and volumes variations in the application scheme e g sub daily pulsing have negligible impact on soil moisture distributions phogat et al 2012 in the second regrow experiment with daily irrigation at 9 surplus of estimated pet a distinguishable wetted zone did develop over the 21 d period the geometry of the wetted zones varied between the soil textures they retained width and height characteristics observed during individual irrigation events karimi and appels 2021 and did not cover the entire rootzone crop regrowth was not visibly variable between and along the driplines which confirmed that compensatory water uptake was taking place the spatial moment analysis of the wetted area during this period showed that the distribution of moisture within the wetted area varied between the soil textures as well the characteristics of the moisture distribution stabilized seven days into the regrow period though the horizontal spatial variance σ2 x fluctuated on a daily cycle in response to irrigation events the differences in center of mass z c and vertical spatial variance σ2 z were smaller than those reported in studies investigating irrigation applications in bare soil conditions lazarovitch et al 2007 sperling and lazarovitch 2010 we attributed this to the effect of the crop on reducing wetting pattern establishment in response to each irrigation application similar to those studies however soil texture affected σ2 z more than it affected σ2 x 4 3 limitations of the experimental setup the nature of the experimental facility may affect the applicability of the indoor findings from this study to the field scale the pet generated in the facility was in the lower spectrum for conditions in the irrigated agriculture region of southern alberta plant water demands could be easily met with short 10 hr irrigation applications under conditions where pet is higher and cannot be met within the operational limits of the sdi system wetted zones could be reduced to smaller volumes and compensatory root water uptake compromised a second limitation to the interpretation of the experimental results was that our sensor network could not fully capture the three dimensional soil moisture distribution that existed around the sdi emitters the comparison of rwu observations and pet estimates suggested that a majority of water uptake took place within the instrumented zone of the cl and ls bins in the c bin a similar spatial pattern of rwu was observed but the total volume of water was not always the same this could have been the result of significant root activity outside of the instrumented area driven by movement of a larger volume of irrigation water out of the instrumented zone through macropores and cracks for future investigations positioning the sensors in a three dimensional grid will be considered 5 conclusions plant rwu and soil hydraulic properties control the redistribution of soil moisture around the emitters of subsurface drip irrigation systems in this work we investigated patterns of root water uptake and wetting in three different soil textural classes cl ls c in which an alfalfa crop was grown in all three soil textures rwu was higher in zones with regular soil moisture fluctuations than in zones with higher but less fluctuating vwc levels rwu was more concentrated spatially in soil types where soil moisture response to irrigation applications were more spatially concentrated as well irrigation applications generated wetted zones with varying geometry and soil moisture distribution in the three soils however for irrigation schedules aimed at replacing crop et the wetted zones reduced within a 24 hr period resulting in minimal lasting differences between the three soils daily irrigation with a 9 surplus for three weeks resulted in wetted zones that retained geometrical characteristics unique to the three soils an analysis of spatial moments revealed that spatial characteristics of the excess moisture distribution stabilized in the first week of the irrigation period while wetted zones generated by irrigation events did not cover the entire root zone volume alfalfa plants in the bins grew uniformly this suggests compensatory water uptake was an important mechanism in the three soils that can overcome moisture limitations resulting from texture dependent wetting dynamics these findings have implications for design of sdi systems for row crops compensatory root water uptake allows moisture to be taken up effectively even when irrigation applications do not generate large wetted zones this means drip line and emitter spacing can be chosen with less focus on soil type but more on root system characteristics of the crops that will be grown in the field a crucial caveat is that an annual crop needs sufficient moisture to develop a complete root system in arid regions without sufficient spring soil moisture or spring rains and complete dependence on the sdi system

10120,when using subsurface drip irrigation sdi to grow field crops concerns may exist for water availability to plants because emitters and plants cannot be lined up perfectly the spatial distribution of water around sdi emitters is largely determined by soil hydraulic properties and characteristics of root water uptake rwu experiments were performed in an indoor facility to quantify the effects of alfalfa rwu on characteristics of wetting patterns in three soil textures in all soils the majority of rwu took place in a layer below the emitters where soil moisture was most dynamic unique wetting patterns developed in the three soils in response to irrigation events however when irrigation applications were aimed to replace potential evapotranspiration these unique patterns disappeared within 24 hr when irrigation was supplied in excess for a 21 d period an effective wetted zone developed over time both the extent of and moisture distribution within the wetted zone varied between the three soil textures an analysis of spatial moments showed that the moisture plume characteristics stabilized within seven days of irrigation and rwu zones of effective drying were observed in all three soils during the 21 d period the alfalfa crop was not negatively affected by the presence of these zones because compensatory rwu was concentrated around the sdi emitters the results of these experiments imply that the design of sdi line spacing can be less focused on soil type when root system size is considered this does require the presence of sufficient early season moisture for the crop to develop a complete root system keywords root water uptake spatial moment analysis experimental hillslope 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a water efficient technology popular for the irrigation of high value fruit and vegetable crops in semi arid regions while long considered un economical for lower value field cropping sdi is increasingly being adopted for the growth of row crops in the great plains region of the usa and canada evett et al 2014 alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 in sdi systems water is pressurized in regularly spaced driplines with passive emitters to deliver water directly into the rootzone which largely eliminates interception and evaporation losses the redistribution of water around emitters is the three dimensional outcome of interactions between flow rate and volume soil hydraulic properties and plant water uptake characteristics assouline 2002 the goals of sdi water management are to promote lateral and upward water movement and to minimize leaching from the rootzone by keeping soils at the right moisture levels lamm and camp 2006 when used for growing row crops it is not possible to line up driplines and emitters with individual rows and plants concerns therefore exist that the non uniform wetting pattern that is a characteristic of sdi systems may result in water stress and lower yields for plant rows positioned further away from the driplines murley et al 2018 the impact of soil hydraulic properties on wetting patters around sdi emitters can be expressed in terms of geometry of the wetted zone plume and the distribution of soil moisture within it for a known volume of water applied with a subsurface irrigation method the extent of the wetted zone increases with larger unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k u of the soil ashrafi et al 2002 this implies smaller wetted zones in low permeability soils such as loams or clays than in high permeability soils such as sands ashrafi et al 2002 cote et al 2003 kanda et al 2020 as well as smaller wetted zones in drier soils than in wetter soils of the same texture skaggs et al 2010 the shape of the wetted zone is also affected by k u with coarser or wetter soils featuring a smaller ratio between width and height of the wetted area than finer or drier soils cote et al 2003 kanda et al 2020 soulis et al 2015 in addition placement of emitters close to the soil surface e g 0 15 m or less may result in larger width to height ratios because of the barrier effect of the soil surface to upward movement kandelous and šimůnek 2010 skaggs et al 2010 a variety of models is available for the analysis of the geometry of soil wetting patterns semi empirical infiltration models for point sources e g schwartzman and zur model 1986 and wetup cook et al 2003 determine the wetted perimeter as a function of emitter flow rate irrigation volume and soil hydraulic properties such as saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s or macroscopic

simulate moisture dynamics resulting from irrigation and root water uptake in more complex soil profiles semi empirical models are practical tools to inform effective and economic spacing of emitters and driplines while numerical models are required when investigating the distribution of moisture around drippers in layered soils soulis and elmaloglou 2018 or when performing multi criteria optimization of system design and crop water management kandelous et al 2012 seidel et al 2015 for soils of varying k u it is not just the extent of a wetted zone that varies but also the spatial distribution of water within the zone an analysis of spatial moments can be used to quantify such distributions yeh et al 2005 analyses of moments of experimental and simulated data of sub surface drip irrigation in sand loam and sandy loam soils have shown that the vertical properties of moisture distributions are affected more by soil texture than the lateral properties lazarovitch et al 2007 sperling and lazarovitch 2010 other numerical simulations of water distribution around surface and subsurface drip emitters have aimed to find the most representative soil moisture region within the rootzone these simulations indicated that representative locations could be found at similar lateral distances but varying depths with respect to emitters in different soil types soulis and elmaloglou 2016 such results have practical applications for the placement of soil moisture sensors to inform irrigation water management soulis et al 2015 successful practical applications however cannot be developed without taking into account the spatial distributions of roots and root water uptake rwu the location of a main water source e g surface sprinkling subsurface drip or capillary rise with respect to plant location influences the spatial distribution of a crop s root system coelho and or 1999 phene et al 1991 reyes cabrera et al 2016 even so rwu is more dynamic and adaptive than root density distribution itself plants invoke compensatory water uptake when subjected to non uniform distributions of water head jarvis 2011 javaux et al 2013 while sometimes thought of as a response to water stress in parts of the root system hopmans and bristow 2002 compensatory uptake can be observed under wetter conditions coelho and or 1999 skaggs et al 2004 phene et al 1991 as a broader passive response to variability of water head gradient over the root soil interface javaux et al 2013 under sdi conditions rwu has been shown to be highly heterogeneous and responsive especially where natural rainfall or other water sources are present in addition to the irrigation system albasha et al 2015 mubarak et al 2009 reyes cabrera et al 2016 rwu will impact the development and longevity of wetted zones around emitters especially when irrigation applications are performed at low flow rates and in small volumes the effects of the dynamics of rwu on the characteristics of wetted zones in different soil textures are poorly quantified to date here we present the results of experiments in which the wetting patterns around sdi emitters were investigated for three different soils with an alfalfa crop the experiments were performed indoors in three large soil bins that feature artificial soil profiles constructed of clay loam cl loamy sand ls and clay c materials native to southern alberta canada the facility provides an opportunity to perform year round sdi studies on field crops our research questions were 1 what are rwu patterns of an alfalfa crop around sdi micro drippers in three soil textural classes 2 what are the characteristics of wetting patterns in three soil textural classes when subjected to an irrigation schedule based on calculated water demand of the growing alfalfa crop we placed soil moisture sensors around sdi emitters for a spatiotemporal analysis of root water uptake and short term and long term wetting dynamics including an analysis of moments 2 methods 2 1 experimental soil bins the experimental setup consisted of three large bins 6 3 3 3 1 2 m l x w x h each containing a 0 9 m artificial soil profile the bottom panel of the bins was flat but a weeping tile drain was positioned at a 1 angle to allow outflow during saturated conditions the soil profiles in the bins were created from agricultural topsoil obtained from three locations in southern alberta selected for their general differences in soil texture and soil hydraulic properties table 1 topsoil material was placed into the bins with a skid steer loader and packed into 0 10 m layers with a walk behind a detailed description of soil profile construction and analysis of the soil hydraulic properties can be found in karimi and appels 2021 alfalfa medicago sativa l was selected as experimental crop for its deep root system and high crop water needs seed was distributed at a rate of 25 kg ha 1 and covered with 0 01 m of pulverized soil material germination was promoted with overhead irrigation with a handheld wand sprayer these overhead irrigations were stopped when the plants reached a 0 04 0 05 m height plant establishment in the c bin was poor most likely due to the abundance of cracks and macropores in this soil the top 0 05 m layer of this soil was mixed with peat sod material to improve establishment the extent of the rooting system was monitored through the transparent polycarbonate panel in each bin roots were observed at 0 90 m depth five months after seeding in keeping with agronomic practices for alfalfa hay the crop was cut every six to eight weeks after it had reached maturity each individual plant would regrow to a height of 0 20 0 25 m within ten days after fifteen days the plants reached a height of 0 40 0 50 m and the canopy covered the soil surface completely again 2 2 subsurface drip irrigation four sdi systems were installed in each bin with different line depths and emitter spacings and the same line spacing table 2 the two systems at 0 30 m depth were installed in an alternating manner for a resulting distance of 0 5 m between individual driplines fig 1 the two systems at 0 20 m depth were also installed in an alternating manner with an offset of 0 25 m compared to the systems below to avoid emitters being positioned in the same vertical line fig 2 overlap of wetted zones generated by the different systems could not be prevented physically however only one system was operated at any time and a rest period of 65 hr or more was observed when irrigation was switched from one system to another all sdi driplines featured typhoon non pressure compensating emitters netafim irrigation inc fresno ca usa each system was operated at a pressure of 10 psi resulting in an emitter flow rate of 0 12 10 3 l s 1 the sdi systems were operated with an nmc junior pro controller netafim irrigation inc fresno ca usa with each bin set up as one zone a 1 8 m wooden frame was constructed over the bins to mount lights and data loggers indoor construction allows for year long operation and multiple growth cycles per year which could otherwise not be achieved in the canadian prairie region 2 3 soil moisture measurements and characterization of soil moisture distribution in each soil bin 10hs capacitance probes meter group pullman wa usa and tdr315 l time domain reflectometers acclima inc kimberly id usa were installed to monitor vwc at multiple depths and various distances from the sdi emitters for the duration of the experiments at 5 minute intervals fourteen sensors formed a vertical cross section around the central emitter of one line of each of the sdi systems fig 2a twelve sensors formed a horizontal cross section at 0 10 m below the soil surface fig 2b four sensors were part of both the vertical and horizontal cross section the 10hs and tdr315 l probes were calibrated for the three soils with a volumetric gravimetric method vaz et al 2013 the readings by the tdr315 l probes did not require a correction when installed in the three soils the readings by the 10hs probes exhibited a 0 03 0 04 m3 m 3 error in the vwc range of 0 15 0 25 m3 m 3 soil specific quadratic equations were fitted to the data and these equations were applied to the 10hs probe readings before analysis karimi and appels 2021 for analysis the vwc readings at a designated time or the change in vwc over a designated time period δvwc were interpolated to a two dimensional surface with the inverse distance weighting function idw from the gstat package in r statistical software r core team 2019 pebesma 2004 gräler et al 2016 2 4 environmental settings environmental conditions in the experimental facility were regulated by a heat recovery ventilator hrv system that served the main 6000 m3 experimental space and three nearby offices the facility and its hrv system were originally designed as educational space and environmental conditions varied consistently between weekdays and weekend days each bin received light from six 40 w fluorescent tube lights gro lux sylvania and three 1000 w high pressure sodium lamps greenpower xtra philips mounted to a wooden frame at 1 8 m above the soil surface in the bins the air temperature relative humidity incoming radiation and wind speed in the experimental facility were monitored at a 5 minute time step the observations were aggregated to an hourly time step and reference evapotranspiration et rs was calculated according to the penman monteith fao 56 method allen 1998 1 et rs 0 408 r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s o e a γ 1 c d

the crop s potential evapotranspiration pet according to 2 pet k c et rs for a mature crop we assigned k c 1 while in the establishment period and after crop cuts we assigned k c 0 33 allen et al 2005 during regrow periods k c was linearly interpolated against time between these two values on weekdays the average air temperature was 20 0 74 c fig 3a with an average rh of 40 9 3 fig 3b the air velocity around the bins varied between 0 1 and 0 7 m s 1 due to variability of the unit flow rate of the hrv and the uneven distribution of air vents in the experimental facility the lights provided incoming radiation r a of 50 3 4 w m 2 at the top of the canopy fig 3c the pattern of hourly et rs reflected the day and week dynamics of the environmental variables fig 3d when operated on a daily schedule of 18 hr light and 6 hr dark photo period the average et rs was 3 4 0 78 mm d 1 on weekdays and 2 0 0 09 mm d 1 on weekend days these et rs values correspond to average alfalfa crop water demand in may and june in southern alberta alberta agriculture and forestry 2016 when operated on a 12 hr light and 12 hr dark photo period the average et rs was 2 3 mm d 1 on weekdays and 1 3 mm d 1 on weekend days 2 5 experiments 2 5 1 spatial distribution of root water uptake one month after the first cut of the alfalfa crop no irrigation was applied to the soil bins for a period of 27 days redistribution of water in the soil profile was negligible after two days and no signs of water stress were observed until day 26 we selected 21 days between redistribution and crop water stress to determine total and daily root water uptake from the vwc observations in the vertical and horizontal profiles fig 2 of each bin under the assumption that any changes in vwc during the drying period were caused by root water uptake the normalized root water uptake was determined from a two dimensional interpolated surface with eq 3 coelho and or 1999 3 u x z t u x z t x z u x z t where u is the normalized root water uptake and u is the cumulative root water uptake or vwc change m3 m 3 in a grid cell with midpoint coordinates x and z during a time period of length t total root water uptake in the bins in mm h2o was calculated by extrapolating the δvwc from the cross sections the observations were assumed to be representative for a 0 15 m layer in y direction and a 0 3 m layer in z direction in the vertical and horizontal cross sections respectively 2 5 2 wetting patterns during alfalfa regrowth after the fifth cut of the alfalfa crop irrigation applications were provided at 2 3 d intervals to the regrowing crop the total amount of irrigation during the 15 d period of interest covered the estimated pet section 2 3 with a small excess of 1 7 mm 6 table 3 the antecedent moisture conditions around the sdi emitters was on average 50 relative saturation in the cl and ls bins and 62 relative saturation in the c bin table 3 for every irrigation application the maximum δvwc and δvwc one day 24 hr after the start of the application were determined for every sensor in the vertical profile the data were interpolated to a two dimensional surface the maximum and 24 hr width w and height h of the wetted profile were determined from these surfaces by contouring the area where δvwc 0 01 m3 m 3 the residual amount of water in the profile 24 hr after the start of the irrigation event was determined by extrapolating the 24 hr δvwc over a 0 15 m soil layer in y direction the difference between maximum and 24 hr geometry of the wetted area and the residual soil moisture mm h2o in the vertical profile after each event were evaluated as a function of time passed since biomass removal 2 5 3 wetting pattern stability and dynamics during a 21 d period after the fourth cut of the alfalfa crop daily irrigation applications were applied with the 24 8 sdi system to provide the regrowing crop with sufficient water to meet pet the daily application volume was increased with time from 2 4 mm d 1 to 3 7 mm d 1 to adapt to the increasing pet during the regrowth period controller issues caused a 2 d and 3 d irrigation gap in the first and third week of regrowth respectively in both cases manual control was taken of sdi systems and 1 8 mm d 1 applied with the 24 8 system in total 91 hr of irrigation provided 55 5 mm of water to the bins to meet an estimated pet of 50 8 mm with a margin of 4 7 mm or 9 the wetting pattern that developed during the 21 d period was analyzed through interpolation of the vwc data in a horizontal and vertical cross section section 2 3 the stability of the wetting pattern during the 21 d period was investigated with an analysis of spatial moments of the water plume around the active sdi emitter the three dimensional spatial moments of a water plume were determined according to yeh et al 2005 4 m ijk t θ diff x y z t x i y j z k d x d y d z where θ diff x y z t θ x y z t θ ini x y z t is the difference in water content at time t and a given location x y z and the initial water content θ at the same location the zeroth first and second spatial moments correspond to i j k 0 1 or 2 respectively the zeroth moment m 000 is the total volume of water applied to the monitored domain the first moments m 100 m 010 and m 001 lead to the location of the centre of the wetting area with the coordinates of the centre of mass x c y c z c given by 5 x c m 100 m 000 y c m 010 m 000 z c m 001 m 000 the second moments m 200 m 020 and m 002 quantify the spread of the plume around its average position when used to calculate the spatial variance in the x y and z direction σ2 x σ2 y and σ2 z respectively according to 6 σ x 2 m 200 m 000 x c 2 σ y 2 m 020 m 000 y c 2 σ z 2 m 002 m 000 z c 2 the positions of sensors in soil bins allowed for determination of moments in a two dimensional area only x and z direction spatial moments analysis has previously been used on surface and subsurface drip irrigation problems in simulations lazarovitch et al 2007 and irrigation lab and field experiments skaggs et al 2010 sperling and lazarovitch 2010 xiong et al 2012 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of root water uptake from visual observations of root penetration we inferred that the alfalfa was able to access soil moisture in any location of the soil profiles provided local conditions were above wilting point fig 4 shows the patterns of normalized root water uptake u in the vertical cross section of each bin at the end of the 21 d drying period the spatial pattern of u was most uniform in the ls bin while that in the c bin was most heterogeneous in all three bins the maximum of u was located at 0 40 m below the soil surface 0 10 or 0 20 m below the four sdi systems the cl and ls bins featured a single maximum u location at this depth fig 4a and b while the c bin featured three local maximum locations fig 4c the maximum of u was located within a radius of 0 3 m of the emitters of the 24 12 system cl the 30 8 24 12 and 24 8 systems ls and the 30 12 30 8 24 12 systems c in the three weeks prior to the drying period irrigation applications had been performed with the 24 12 system cl and ls and with both the 24 12 and 30 12 system c the spatial distribution of u did not correspond to the spatial distribution of average vwc v w c during the drying period fig 5 the largest values of u were found in the 0 26 0 29 m3 m 3 cl 0 22 0 27 m3 m 3 ls 0 37 0 43 m3 m 3 c vwc ranges while locations with v w c up to 0 35 0 32 0 47 m3 m 3 were observed in the respective bins these higher vwc values were found deeper in the rootzones at depths larger than 0 6 m below the soil surface during the drying period the estimated pet was 2 3 mm d 1 on weekdays and 1 3 mm d 1 on weekends section 2 4 the total rwu in the root zone profile during the drying period was 0 21 m3 m 3 d 1 in the cl bin 0 17 m3 m 3 d 1 in the ls bin and 0 1 m3 m 3 d 1 in the c bin table 4 shows the extrapolated daily rwu for each week in the drying period and the 21 d average the values of the horizontal profile sensors were not extrapolated to the entire root zone but only to the top 0 3 m soil layer a difference between pet estimated from environmental conditions and rwu determined from vwc observations was expected due to the heterogeneous wetting patterns in sdi systems and the layout of our sensor network however the differences in rwu between the bins and weeks in the drying period were larger than expected table 4 daily rwu was 35 higher in the cl bin than in the ls bin and 123 higher in the cl bin than in the c bin under the same environmental conditions daily rwu from the vertical profile was 94 cl 70 ls and 42 c of the estimated daily pet in all three bins rwu was higher in the first week than in the other two weeks of the drying period this may indicate that the decreasing vwc levels in the bins did restrict rwu during part of the drying period even though signs of water stress were not observed in all three bins daily rwu from the top 0 3 m of the soil profile was 15 of the daily rwu in the vertical cross section 3 2 wetting patterns during alfalfa regrowth the effects of the cutting of alfalfa biomass on wetting patterns in the three soil bins is illustrated in fig 6 the maximum extent of the wetted area in terms of its width w and height h was 0 46 0 03 m by 0 46 0 09 m for the cl bin 0 46 0 02 m by 0 60 0 11 m for the ls bin and 0 45 0 02 m by 0 56 0 02 m for the c bin cutting of the alfalfa biomass led to a temporary decrease in pet and root water uptake as a result the wetted area had only decreased by 0 05 m in h and w 24 hr after the start of the irrigation event fig 6a while the δvwc in the vertical profile was 4 11 mm after 24 hr fig 6b as the biomass regrew to full canopy the difference between maximum and 24 hr extent of the wetted area increased fig 6a and the 24 hr δvwc in the profile decreased fig 6b two weeks after the biomass cut a 7 hr irrigation application did not leave a wetted area in the ls bin after 24 h while in the cl and c bins the wetted area was reduced to less than 50 of its maximum extent the accompanying 24 h δvwc in the profile was reduced to 1 2 mm in the two week period we did not observe spatial differences in regrowth of plants along or between the driplines interestingly the crop needed some time to adjust its water uptake when a different sdi system was used for irrigation in a fully developed crop 29 d after biomass cut switching to a system that had not been used for 20 days resulted in a difference between maximum and 24 hr extent of the wetted area that was similar to the difference observed directly after the biomass cut fig 6c in a 4 d period the difference increased to values of 0 20 0 40 m similar to values observed 14 d after the biomass cut the 24 hr δvwc decreased from 7 11 to 2 3 mm fig 6d the final δvwc in the cl bin was higher than the final δvwc after the biomass cut 3 3 wetting pattern dynamics and stability during a 21 d period for the duration of the 21 d experimental period the 9 over irrigation resulted in increases of vwc at all depths in the three bins fig 7 the characteristics of the wetting response varied between the bins and with time within active wetted areas around the sdi emitter a vwc response could be distinguished for each event fig 7c outside this active area steady vwc increases were observed even though event responses were not e g c in fig 7a and b or cl in fig 7f where the soil was dry at the beginning of the experimental period the passing of the wetting front could lead to a change from one to the other response type cl in fig 7d soil heterogeneity affected these responses with both response types occurring concurrently at the same lateral distance from the active emitter ls in fig 7b the largest vwc changes were observed 0 20 0 40 m below the soil surface in all three bins with 21 d increases of 0 17 0 10 and 0 20 m3 m 3 in the cl ls c bins respectively vwc changes smaller than 0 02 m3 m 3 were observed at 0 55 m below the soil surface and deeper cl ls bins and in the top 0 20 m below the soil surface c bin the spatial distribution of vwc change at the end of the 21 d experimental period is presented in fig 8 for the shallow horizontal upper row and vertical lower row cross sections in the bins in the ls bin positive δvwc was more widespread and more uniformly distributed than in the cl and c bins in both the horizontal fig 8c and vertical fig 8d cross sections of the ls bin the δvwc patterns were almost symmetrical around the sdi emitter though the response types were not fig 7 negative δvwc was observed 0 10 m below the surface at 0 40 0 50 m distance laterally from the emitter in the cl and c bins the positive δvwc in the vertical cross sections was distributed in an approximate elliptical shape around and under the emitter fig 8b and f areas with negative δvwc were found deeper into the rootzone than in the ls bin in the horizontal cross sections positive δvwc was not found symmetrically around the emitter fig 8a and e indicating more soil hydraulic heterogeneity than in the ls bin we did not observe spatial differences in regrowth of plants along or between the driplines an analysis of moments was used to investigate the stability of the spatial distribution of vwc over the 21 d period during the experimental period the zeroth moment m 000 increased in all three bins as more water was applied to the domain than was taken up by the crop fig 9a temporary decreases were observed on the days the irrigation controller failed in the cl and c bins m 000 stabilized 16 18 days into the experimental period suggesting that irrigation and root water uptake were balancing each other in the ls bin m 000 increased more than in the cl and c bins after day 6 suggesting that a larger fraction of the applied volume of water was retained in the instrumented part of the rootzone than in other zones along the sdi lines the total irrigated volume during the 21 d period was 38 dm3 of which only 8 cl c and 16 ls was present in the instrumented profile at the end of the experimental period m 000 in the cl and c bins was close to the 9 excess irrigation provided to the alfalfa crop based on pet calculations the vertical coordinate of the center of mass z c derived from the first and zeroth moment by eq 5 was found below the emitter in all three bins at depths of 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m below the soil surface for the cl ls and c bins respectively at the end of the 21 day period fig 9b in the cl and ls bins z c moved deeper into the rootzone with time while in the c bin an initial decrease of z c was followed by a 0 06 m increase in the second and third week the ratio between spatial variance in the x and z direction σ2 x σ2 z increased with time in the ls bin while it decreased with time in the cl bin fig 9c in the ls bin the increase of the ratio was the result of σ2 x increasing more than σ2 z whereas in the cl bin σ2 x effectively decreased and σ2 z remained stable after an initial increase in the c bin σ2 x decreased during the first five days and increased during the last five days of the period while σ2 z remained stable results not shown contraction and expansion of the wetted area fluctuated more in lateral x direction than in vertical z direction in all bins however variability on a sub daily timescale was observed in the cl and c bins but not in the ls bin in the c bin the spatial variance in both x and z direction was affected by redistribution of water between irrigation events leading to negative values for integral in eq 4 with i j k 2 lazarovitch et al 2007 suggest this could be overcome by using background vwc instead of initial vwc to determine the spread of vwc with time however that approach can only be applied when investigating model simulations as such the σ2 x σ2 z ratio could not be successfully used to characterize vwc pattern development in the c bin beyond suggesting it was more heterogeneous than in the other two bins 4 discussion 4 1 what are rwu patterns of an alfalfa crop around sdi micro drippers in three soil textural classes the alfalfa root water uptake patterns observed in the three soils all peaked in a band between 0 3 and 0 5 m below the soil surface under the emitters of the sdi systems the level of variability of rwu varied between the three soils with the ls bin featuring the most homogeneous distribution of rwu while the cl and c bins featured a concentration of rwu under one and three emitters respectively fig 4 during irrigation periods soil moisture levels around and under the sdi emitters showed the largest fluctuations while soil moisture levels deeper in the profile increased more slowly fig 7 during the drying period rwu was higher in zones that were previously subjected to rapid moisture fluctuations than in zones that featured higher average soil moisture levels but less fluctuations fig 4 these observations are in agreement with field observations of maize crop under sdi conditions albasha et al 2015 root distribution was not believed to be a limiting factor for rwu root presence was confirmed qualitatively at all depths in the soil profiles section 2 1 the presence of multiple sdi systems at different depths and short 0 25 m alternating distances could have resulted in a broader root establishment than typical for a crop grown at a smaller row distance than dripline spacing however while root density distributions will develop in response to the location of a water source water is not the only driver of root density distribution and in field situations plant roots will develop beyond the direct sphere of influence of any sdi emitter coelho and or 1999 phene et al 1991 reyes cabrera et al 2016 the occurrence of maximum rwu in zones where vwc and water head were most dynamic instead of wetter less dynamic areas was in agreement with other studies on the compensatory nature of rwu albasha et al 2015 couvreur et al 2012 jarvis 2011 however our observations indicate that adapting root water uptake in response to a change of water source may not occur immediately during the drying period maximum rwu values were observed near the systems that were operated in the three weeks before the drying period in the clay loam and clay soils such a strong correlation was not observed in the loamy sand soil the switch to a different sdi system which had not been operated for more than 20 days previously for water appeared to take a day to generate a response by the fully mature alfalfa crop of the first regrowth experiment the first application through a new system resulted in similar wetted zone characteristics as an identical water application to a crop that had just been cut and had a much lower water demand two to four day rest periods did not induce a similar rwu delay this behaviour was observed in all three soils 4 2 what are the characteristics of wetting patterns in three soil textural classes when subjected to an irrigation schedule based on calculated water demand of the growing alfalfa crop the observations of wetted area dynamics during the 15 d regrow period illustrate the interaction between soil texture and its associated soil hydraulic properties and crop characteristics the irrigation applications during this period were aimed at meeting crop water demand with an irrigation frequency of once every two days the maximum extents of the wetted zone varied between the three soil bins with the c soil moving water preferentially downward through macropores the ls soil spreading water laterally and vertically and the cl soil retaining water in the shallow depths of the rootzone karimi and appels 2021 immediately after the alfalfa cut the crop water demand was low enough for these patterns to remain present 24 hr after the start of the irrigation event though no increase of the wetted area was observed as reported by skaggs et al 2010 in a surface drip system installed in bare soil as the crop regrew the effect of irrigation at the 24 hr mark decreased rapidly in all three soils after two weeks of growth water applications still generated different soil moisture responses in the three soils but the differences were no longer distinguishable after 24 hr this observation is in accordance with field and numerical experiments of pet based irrigation schedules at various application frequencies when using pet as a target for irrigation regular irrigation events provide a modest amount of water per event promoting root water uptake over leaching wang et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 because rwu and irrigation occur at similar timescales and volumes variations in the application scheme e g sub daily pulsing have negligible impact on soil moisture distributions phogat et al 2012 in the second regrow experiment with daily irrigation at 9 surplus of estimated pet a distinguishable wetted zone did develop over the 21 d period the geometry of the wetted zones varied between the soil textures they retained width and height characteristics observed during individual irrigation events karimi and appels 2021 and did not cover the entire rootzone crop regrowth was not visibly variable between and along the driplines which confirmed that compensatory water uptake was taking place the spatial moment analysis of the wetted area during this period showed that the distribution of moisture within the wetted area varied between the soil textures as well the characteristics of the moisture distribution stabilized seven days into the regrow period though the horizontal spatial variance σ2 x fluctuated on a daily cycle in response to irrigation events the differences in center of mass z c and vertical spatial variance σ2 z were smaller than those reported in studies investigating irrigation applications in bare soil conditions lazarovitch et al 2007 sperling and lazarovitch 2010 we attributed this to the effect of the crop on reducing wetting pattern establishment in response to each irrigation application similar to those studies however soil texture affected σ2 z more than it affected σ2 x 4 3 limitations of the experimental setup the nature of the experimental facility may affect the applicability of the indoor findings from this study to the field scale the pet generated in the facility was in the lower spectrum for conditions in the irrigated agriculture region of southern alberta plant water demands could be easily met with short 10 hr irrigation applications under conditions where pet is higher and cannot be met within the operational limits of the sdi system wetted zones could be reduced to smaller volumes and compensatory root water uptake compromised a second limitation to the interpretation of the experimental results was that our sensor network could not fully capture the three dimensional soil moisture distribution that existed around the sdi emitters the comparison of rwu observations and pet estimates suggested that a majority of water uptake took place within the instrumented zone of the cl and ls bins in the c bin a similar spatial pattern of rwu was observed but the total volume of water was not always the same this could have been the result of significant root activity outside of the instrumented area driven by movement of a larger volume of irrigation water out of the instrumented zone through macropores and cracks for future investigations positioning the sensors in a three dimensional grid will be considered 5 conclusions plant rwu and soil hydraulic properties control the redistribution of soil moisture around the emitters of subsurface drip irrigation systems in this work we investigated patterns of root water uptake and wetting in three different soil textural classes cl ls c in which an alfalfa crop was grown in all three soil textures rwu was higher in zones with regular soil moisture fluctuations than in zones with higher but less fluctuating vwc levels rwu was more concentrated spatially in soil types where soil moisture response to irrigation applications were more spatially concentrated as well irrigation applications generated wetted zones with varying geometry and soil moisture distribution in the three soils however for irrigation schedules aimed at replacing crop et the wetted zones reduced within a 24 hr period resulting in minimal lasting differences between the three soils daily irrigation with a 9 surplus for three weeks resulted in wetted zones that retained geometrical characteristics unique to the three soils an analysis of spatial moments revealed that spatial characteristics of the excess moisture distribution stabilized in the first week of the irrigation period while wetted zones generated by irrigation events did not cover the entire root zone volume alfalfa plants in the bins grew uniformly this suggests compensatory water uptake was an important mechanism in the three soils that can overcome moisture limitations resulting from texture dependent wetting dynamics these findings have implications for design of sdi systems for row crops compensatory root water uptake allows moisture to be taken up effectively even when irrigation applications do not generate large wetted zones this means drip line and emitter spacing can be chosen with less focus on soil type but more on root system characteristics of the crops that will be grown in the field a crucial caveat is that an annual crop needs sufficient moisture to develop a complete root system in arid regions without sufficient spring soil moisture or spring rains and complete dependence on the sdi system such a simplified design approach cannot be used declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10121,this study was conducted to understand the mechanism of wheat yield decrease under drought stress and the role of co2 in modulating physiological and metabolic drought effects wheat was grown

activities of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes were decreased in leaf and increased in spikes during drought total antioxidant potential tap was decreased under drought both in leaf and spike grain

invertase activity while it negatively correlated with ascorbate peroxidase cell wall peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in leaves thousand kernel weight positively correlated with leaf phosphoglucoisomerase and spike glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase activities this indicates that elevated co2 could boost co2 assimilation through an increase in antioxidant potential and facilitate

factor it generates unaffordable changes in plants resulting in inhibition of photosynthesis growth and subsequently the yield components kumari et al 2016 rapid inhibition of shoot and limitation of root growth are the symptoms induced by drought which are further characterized by stomatal closure resulting in reduced transpiration rate and co2 uptake during photosynthesis tabassam et al 2014 the

for the corresponding physiological changes relevant for the ultimate impact on agronomic traits großkinsky et al 2015 drought stress is a complex phenomenon interconnected and regulated by a number of parameters zivcak et al 2013 drought stress reduces plant an gs and e while elevated co2 may improve plant water status by reducing gs and thereby raising water use efficiency ameliorating the adverse effects of stressful factors on plant growth and physiological processes ainsworth and rogers 2007 xu et al 2013 xu et al 2014 in our study plants decreased stomatal conductance and increased photosynthetic rate under combined response to e co2 and drought conditions table 1 we also recorded decreased ψι and ψπ under drought conditions where e co2 improved ψπ indicating that e co2 may help plants to maintain ψπ and resultantly higher an under combined drought and e co2 table 1 the source sink relationship is a pivotal factor influencing grain yield as the final grain weight highly depends on the amount of photo assimilates available per grain during the early grain filling stage gambín et al 2008 hisse et al 2019 at anthesis drought stress increases pollen and ovary abortion induces poor anther dehiscence and restricts panicle exertion due to shortened peduncle length resulting in higher spikelet sterility in rice wheat and maize rang et al 2011 powell et al 2012 aslam et al 2013 in this study drought stress reduced grain number and size and resultantly grain yield while e co2 improved grain yield both under well watered and drought environments table 4 drought stress at flowering has also been reported to reduce grain number and size through limited supply of photosynthates barnabás et al 2008 bernard and habash 2009 dolferus et al 2013 hirel et al 2007 modhej et al 2012 moradi and ismail 2007 li et al 2019 that reduces grain number and weight while e co2 supports plants in maintaining grain yield mainly due to change in grain number and weight significant positive correlations of an and ψπ with bm ngs and tkw indicate that the maintenance of higher ψπ and an may help to attain higher ngs and tkw through an increase in bm under simultaneous drought and

and heat tolerant cultivars of wheat were found to be characterized by different activities of peroxidase asthir et al 2010 in agreement with previous studies our results indicate that higher antioxidants potential helping the plants to maintain higher an and resultantly higher grain number and weight is achieved under combined effect of drought and e co2 apart from redox pathway enzyme activities involved in carbohydrate metabolism are also key determinants of the physiological state and yield related traits of a plant shokat et al 2020b yoshida et al 1998 reported that accumulated carbohydrates before heading can contribute up to 40 while photosynthesis during grain filling contributes up to 60 to grain carbohydrates under drought stress conditions we found a decrease in an and most of the carbohydrate metabolic enzymes in leaves and oppositely an increase in activities in spikes similar results were reported by shokat et al 2020b where a decrease in an and most of the carbohydrate metabolic enzymes of leaves was reported under drought conditions indicating that limited carbohydrates are available for the developing organs in the current study activities of leaf

10121,this study was conducted to understand the mechanism of wheat yield decrease under drought stress and the role of co2 in modulating physiological and metabolic drought effects wheat was grown under ambient and elevated co2 400 and 800 ppm respectively and plants were subjected to drought stress prior to anthesis photosynthetic rate an stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate e and activities of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes were decreased in leaf and increased in spikes during drought total antioxidant potential tap was decreased under drought both in leaf and spike grain yield parameters were again reduced under drought while an e and most of the yield traits were increased under elevated co2 the number of grains spike 1 correlated positively with an tap and cell wall invertase activity while it negatively correlated with ascorbate peroxidase cell wall peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in leaves thousand kernel weight positively correlated with leaf phosphoglucoisomerase and spike glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase activities this indicates that elevated co2 could boost co2 assimilation through an increase in antioxidant potential and facilitate more photosynthate supply via various increased carbohydrate metabolic enzyme activities and thus increases yield this could be a possible mechanism of grain yield increase caused by elevated co2

10122,improving efficiency with the use of rainfall is one of the effective ways to conserve water in agriculture at present weather forecasting can be used to potentially conserve irrigation water but the risks of unnecessary irrigation and the yield loss due to the uncertainty of weather forecasts should be avoided thus a deep q learning dqn irrigation decision making strategy based on short term weather forecasts was proposed to determine the optimal irrigation decision the utility of the method is demonstrated for paddy rice grown in nanchang china the short term weather forecasts and observed meteorological data of the paddy rice growth period from 2012 to 2019 were collected from stations near nanchang irrigation was decided for two irrigation decision making strategies namely conventional irrigation i e flooded irrigation commonly used by local farmers and dqn irrigation and their performance in water conservation was evaluated the results showed that the daily rainfall forecasting performance was acceptable with potential space for learning and exploitation the dqn irrigation strategy had strong generalization ability after training and can be used to make irrigation decisions using weather forecasts in our case simulation results indicated that compared with conventional irrigation decisions dqn irrigation took advantage of water conservation from unnecessary irrigation resulting in irrigation water savings of 23 mm and reducing drainage by 21 mm and irrigation timing by 1 0 times on average without significant yield reduction the dqn irrigation strategy of learning from past irrigation experiences and the uncertainties in weather forecasts avoided the risks of imperfect weather forecasting keywords reinforcement learning irrigation decision making paddy rice irrigation weather forecasts 1 introduction rice is one of the major grain crops in china comprising approximately 30 million hectares of the planting area nbsprc 2019 as a water loving crop rice needs a large amount of fresh water for irrigation during its growth although the water resources in china are abundant they are distributed unevenly in time and space and do not match perfectly with the rice irrigation demand in addition with rapidly increasing industrial and domestic water consumption the amount of agricultural water resources has decreased and water scarcity has become a threat to irrigated rice driving calls for constant development of new methods of irrigation aimed at increasing the efficiency of allocated irrigation water mao 2002 an important attempt to achieve this goal is linked to the improvement in rainfall use efficiency using rainfall information in weather forecasts to make irrigation decisions can conserve irrigation water in recent years public weather forecasts mishra et al 2013 lorite et al 2015 luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 traore et al 2016 and numerical weather forecasts perera et al 2014 medina et al 2018 have been applied to determine reference evapotranspiration et0 in the development of irrigation schedules however these researches did not consider future rainfall and a large difference was observed between the et0 and actual irrigation demand making it difficult to put into practice therefore certain studies incorporated the et0 and precipitation forecasts for irrigation demand predictions perera et al 2016 longo minnolo et al 2020 the literature is rich in setting decision rules for determining the irrigated time and amount by using short term weather forecasts cao et al 2019 cai et al 2011 gowing and ejieji 2001 linker and sylaios 2016 bergez and garcia 2010 however one major issue in previous studies is that the risks due to the uncertainties in weather forecasts i e unnecessary irrigation applied to the field because of unexpected rainfall and potential yield reduction if irrigation is delayed should be considered in making irrigation decisions using weather forecasts mondaca duarte et al 2020 when considering the balance between crop yield and water saving most studies normally focus on short term risks by applying a strategy that delays irrigation or removes the expected rainfall from the irrigation water and simply simulates the loss of yield using the average historical data or does not give sufficient consideration to yield thus failing to obtain the long term effects of current irrigation decisions which makes it difficult to obtain the global optimal solution for rice irrigation decision optimization the irrigation decision must determine the timing and amount of irrigation applied to the field which can be formulated as a markov decision process i e the future state is only related to the current state lee et al 1991 reinforcement learning rl a machine learning method that uses rewards obtained in the process of interaction with the environment to guide behavior and constantly learns a strategy to maximize the ultimate cumulative rewards is suitable for decision making process with the markov property sutton and barto 2018 as a branch of rl the deep q learning network dqn combines the perception ability of deep learning and its own decision making ability mnih et al 2013 and can supply new solutions to cognitive decision making problems in complex states as a new method in computer science rl has been widely used in prediction görges 2017 intelligent control chen and su 2018 decision support shen et al 2017 wu et al 2018 and many other fields but less attention has been given to irrigation management bergez et al 2001 compared the dynamic programming dp and rl methods for the identification of optimal initial irrigation strategies with limited irrigation water for maize crops coupled with a stochastic random weather generator the results showed that rl performed better than dp when only a small number of simulation runs were available irukula 2015 optimized the water consumption as much as possible without affecting the crop yield by using the rl algorithm on a maize crop simulation model according to daily conditions such as temperature solar radiation rainfall and soil water content a decrease in water consumption of almost 40 was achieved compared with the constant irrigation method and without any significant decrease in yield and leaf area index bu and wang 2019 designed a smart agriculture internet of things iot system based on deep reinforcement learning and presented several representative deep reinforcement learning models the reviewed water resources studies used rl as a heuristic decision optimization method focusing on use of real time data collected from the farmland or simulator without considering the future rainfall information contained in a weather forecast with the improvement in weather forecast quality use of the reinforcement learning method can excavate hidden information and improve rainfall use efficiency in this paper a rl approach based on the dqn was proposed for irrigation decision making using weather forecasting this approach is known as the dqn irrigation decision making strategy dqn irrigation strategy and the paddy rice of nanchang a typical rice planting area of china was chosen as a case study for validation the rainfall forecast is the main variable of the dqn irrigation strategy and its accuracy has a great influence on the strategy performance therefore we first evaluated the forecasting performance of daily rainfall for lead times of 1 7 days and a simple water balance model and a crop water production function used to simulate the real state of the paddy rice and field were integrated with the dqn algorithm for irrigation decision making the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the quality of the short term public weather forecasts for different types of paddy rice in different periods in nanchang 2 to propose a reinforcement learning strategy based on dqn for irrigation decision making and to analyze its training and generalization results and 3 to verify the effect of this proposed strategy in conventional flooded irrigation in terms of water conservation and drainage reduction and to preliminarily illustrate how the proposed method saves water by considering the rainfall forecast 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data paddy rice is mainly distributed in southern china and includes double season rice early rice and late rice and single season rice middle rice in this study data from nanchang in southern china on double season rice and single season rice were used to verify the proposed method fig 1 to increase the number of samples in the training set the daily observed meteorological data of the paddy rice growing period at three stations near nanchang from 2012 to 2019 table 1 were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma gov cn including daily minimum and maximum temperature average temperature average wind speed sunshine duration mean relative humidity and precipitation the weather type of the public weather forecast data that contained rainfall information with a 7 day lead time for the same period was collected from weather china http www weather com cn noting that the observed and forecast weather data for certain periods were incomplete the data in 2012 for the early rice growth period and the data in 2014 for the middle rice and late rice growth period were not included in this study the data from 2012 to 2018 were set as the training set and the data of 2019 were set as the verification set information on agricultural management from 2012 to 2019 in nanchang was obtained from field experiments and included phenological data crop coefficients and irrigation scheduling the growth period of paddy rice was divided into six stages the returning green rg early tillering et late tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mi and yellow ripe yr stages all types of rice were assumed to apply the conventional flooded irrigation regime according to the experience in irrigation from local farmers and the crop coefficients and the criteria of field water depth in each growth stage of paddy rice are shown in table 2 2 2 evaluation of weather forecasting previous studies reported that uncertainties exist in the application of weather forecasting to irrigation or evapotranspiration forecasting luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 cao et al 2019 to evaluate the performance of weather forecasting the threat score ts missing alarm rate mar and false alarm rate far were used donaldson et al 1975 wilks 2006 1 t s n a n a n b n c 2 m a r n c n a n c 3 f a r n b n a n b where na is the number of hits i e the days that both forecasts and observations fall in the prescribed threshold ranges nb is the number of false alarms i e the days that the forecast falls in the threshold ranges but the observation does not and nc is the number of misses i e the days that the forecast falls outside the threshold range and the observation falls inside the threshold range according to the cumulative rainfall over 24 h the weather type was divided into 5 categories and the threshold values for no rain nr light rain lr moderate rain mr heavy rain hr storm or above st were set as 0 0 1 0 1 10 10 25 25 50 and 50 mm respectively it is worth noting that the type of storm or above in this case was composed of storms heavy storms and severe storms due to the low probability of individual occurrences 2 3 determination of crop evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration is estimated by allen et al 1998 4 e t c k c k s e t 0 where k c is the single crop coefficient k s is the water stress coefficient for soil water limiting conditions k s 1 otherwise k s 1 and et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day reference evapotranspiration is a key parameter to compute crop water requirement determine irrigation schedule and conduct reasonable farmland water management at present there are many calculation methods for example hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 blaney criddle blaney and criddle 1962 mccloud mccloud 1955 and other temperature based methods irmak allen irmak et al 2003 and other empirical methods priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 and other radiation based method fao24 penman doorenbos and pruitt 1975 fao56 penman manteith allen et al 1998 and other synthesis methods as the fao56 penman manteith method has a high precision and a solid application foundation and all the meteorological variables needed can be obtained therefore in this case fao56 penman manteith method was selected for reference evapotranspiration and it can be expressed as 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s

soil type e g 0 16 at clay loam 2 4 crop water production function when the weather forecast information is considered in irrigation scheduling irrigation might be delayed to wait for rainfall in the forecast resulting in water deficit and leading to yield reduction to evaluate the effect of water deficit on crop yield the crop water production function was used to establish the functional relationship between water deficit and yield at a specific growth stage according to previous studies paddy rice in southern china usually adopts the jenson model jensen 1968 to quantify the effect the model is expressed as 9 y a y m i 1 n e t a e t m i λ i where y a is the actual crop yield y m is the maximum crop yield et a is the actual crop evapotranspiration et m is the maximum crop evapotranspiration n is the number of growth stages i is the ordinal number of the growth stage i 1 2 n and λ i is the water stress sensitivity index at growth stage i in this study the values of λ i for the three rice types were derived from the literature as shown in table 3 luo 2003 2 5 dqn algorithm for irrigation decision a markov property is present in the process of irrigation decision making the irrigation decision is made based on soil water content and crop condition in the observation stage it is obvious that the state of the soil system and the crop condition at the current moment is only related to the state of the soil system climatic conditions crop conditions and the decision adopted the amount of irrigation water at the previous moment thus rl was introduced to solve the irrigation decision problem with the markov property 2 5 1 environment of rl rl refers to a method of machine learning in which an agent interacts with an environment through a sequence of observations actions and rewards the goal of the agent is to find an optimal policy that selects actions in a fashion that maximizes cumulative future rewards the environment of reinforcement can be expressed as 10 e s a p r where s is the state space a is the action space p is the transition probability and r is the reward function state space consists of the environmental parameters in the decision making cycle of the area to be irrigated i e a certain day in the growing period of crops and it can be expressed as 11 s t p t h t h min h max h p where p t is the forecast rainfall sequence for the next 7 days on day t mm h t is the water depth on day t mm h min is the lower limit of water depth mm h max is the upper limit of water depth mm h p is the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall and the value of h min h max and h p are updated in accordance with the growth period of day t see table 2 action space is the option of irrigation decision making in this case there are 3 possible actions that represent the proportion of the irrigation quota irrigate until h max to be supplied to the field on day t action 0 supplies 0 action 1 supplies 50 and action 2 supplies 100 the transition probability is the probability that makes the environment move from the current state to another state after the irrigation decision is executed including evapotranspiration update forecast weather data update and change in depth of water the change of water depth is expressed as 12 m t h max h t a t 0 1 2 h max h t a t 1 h t a t 2 13 h t 1 h t m t where m t is the amount of irrigation water on day t mm h t 1 is the depth of water on day t 1 mm after executing action a t at state s t actual meteorological and field conditions are observed and the environmental state parameters including actual evapotranspiration and water depth should be modified the modifier formula of water depth can be expressed as 14 h t 1 h t 1 p t 1 e t c t f t h t 1 p t 1 e t c t f t h p h p h t 1 p t 1 e t c t f t h p where h t 1 is the actual depth of water on day t 1 mm and p t 1 et c t and f t are the actual rainfall evapotranspiration and deep percolation on day t respectively mm in this study the daily deep percolation was set as a constant value the value for clay loam was set as 2 mm before the field water was depleted otherwise the value was set as zero the reward function is the reward feedback when the environment moves from the current state to another state after the irrigation decision is executed in this case the reward function consists of multiplying three subfunctions as follows 15 r t r 0 t r 1 t r 2 t where r 0 t represents the basic reward r 1 t represents the rainfall utilization reward and r 2 t represents the yield reward r 1 t is expressed as 16 r 1 t e t c t t 7 f t t 7 p t t 7 m t h t h t 7 where et c t t 7 f t t 7 and p t t 7 are the cumulative amount of actual evapotranspiration deep percolation and rainfall in the next 7 days from day t to day t 7 after executing action a t for example a 7 day observation was conducted from day t if taking action 2 the water was filled to the upper limit of water depth i e m t h max h t and drainage occurred if the depth of the water layer reached the maximum allowable water depth after the rainfall h p otherwise no other operation was performed the total amount of all indicators within 7 days was recorded where h t 7 is the water depth at the end of day t 7 the value of r 1 t represents the impact of irrigation decisions on rainfall utilization if no drainage event occurs r 1 t is equal to 1 which means all rainfall is used for field consumption and there is no waste of water caused by rainfall after irrigation otherwise r 1 t is less than 1 which means that drainage wastes part of the rainfall and reduces rainfall utilization r 2 t is expressed as 17 r 2 t e t c t t 7 e t m t t 7 λ where et m t t 7 represents the cumulative amount of actual evapotranspiration from non stressed treatment in the next 7 days from day t to day t 7 after executing action at λ is water stress sensitivity index in accordance with growth period of day t see table 3 the value of r 2 t represents the influence of irrigation decisions on yields if r 2 t is less than 1 after a specific decision is made e g action a 2 it indicates that crops will suffer from water deficit in the next few days resulting in the yield loss otherwise this irrigation decision has no adverse effect on crop yield r 0 t is expressed as 18 r 0 t 1 a t 0 a t 1or2 h t h min h t h min 9 a t 1 h t h min 10 a t 0 a t 2 h t h min h t h min the value of r 0 t represents whether the irrigation decision conforms to the irrigation baseline according to the depth of traditional irrigation criteria eq 18 indicates that if the basic principle of traditional irrigation is violated e g irrigating before reaching the lower limit of water depth there will be a small reward i e 1 moreover we believe that when the water depth in the field reaches the lower limit of water depth and irrigation is required taking action a1 should receive a smaller reward than action a2 this difference of 1 is set to compensate for rising costs since action a1 i e small irrigation quota will increase the irrigation times to some extent it is worthwhile noting that r 0 t will only be determined according to eq 18 if there is no drainage in the next 7 days after irrigation namely r 1 1 otherwise r 0 1 because when drainage events occur we want the irrigation decision should be based on the balance of rainfall utilization reward and yield reward without being constrained by irrigation baseline to evaluate the strategy the action value function q was used to represent the accumulated value of the long term expected reward sutton and barto 2018 given policy π for irrigation decision making the q for selecting action a under input sate s can be defined as 19 q π s a ε π t 0 γ i r t i s t s a t a where γ is the discount factor and is set as 0 2 in this case i is the number of subsequent execution steps and s a is the joint vector of state and action the optimal q function q can be defined as 20 q s a max π q π s a the optimal stationary policy is 21 π s arg max a a q s a 2 5 2 deep q learning network algorithm when reinforcement model is complete known that is every part of eq 17 is known reinforcement learning problems can be transformed into optimal control problems i e model based reinforcement problem the model based reinforcement problems i e where the transition probability set is given can be solved efficiently by dynamic programming techniques however the transition probability set of our irrigation model is not completely given i e uncertainties exist related to rainfall in the future on the other hand the traditional reinforcement learning approach is usually designed for discrete cases while the water depth and precipitation are not distributed discretely in other words certain issues are associated with the continuous state space to address the continuous state space and enhance the learning speed we leverage deep neural network dnn technology to realize a deep q learning network algorithm for irrigation decision making according to basic q learning algorithm q should be updated by the following equation known as off policy temporal difference learning watkins and dayan 1992 22 q s t a t q s t a t α r t γ max a t 1 q s t 1 a t 1 q s t a t where α is the learning rate and is set as 0 001 0 0003 and 0 0002 for early rice middle rice and late rice respectively to deal with the continuous state space a neural network function approximator with weight θ was used as a q network mnih et al 2015 this approximator can be trained by minimizing a sequence of loss functions l k θ k that changes at each iteration k and the loss function is defined as 23 l k θ k ε r γ max a t 1 q s t 1 a t 1 θ k q s t a t θ k 2 where r γ max q s t 1 a t 1 θ k is the target of iteration k θ k is the parameter used to compute the target network and θ k is the parameter of the q network of iteration k the target network parameter θ k is only updated with the q network parameter θ k every c steps thus the update of action value function is adjusted by updating the q network parameter as 24 θ k 1 θ k α θ k l k θ k the partial in the θ k direction is defined as 25 θ k l k θ k ε r γ max a t 1 q s t 1 a t 1 θ k q s t a t θ k θ k q s t a t θ k in training the neural network to avoid a sub optimal policy in which the agent does not have the opportunity to sample state actions with higher returns an ε greedy policy was used that selects the action that maximizes q s t a t θ k with probability 1 ε or a random action with probability ε additionally to ensure the convergence and stability of neural network training dqn introduced the so called experience replay mnih et al 2015 to break the connection among data and to make better use of historical data samples i e the agent stored data in a database in the process of reinforcement learning and subsequently used the uniform random sampling method to extract data from the database to a minibatch and the state of each episode was initialized randomly at the training stage to avoid model uncertainties caused by initial conditions li et al 2009 finally the extracted data were used to train the neural network as shown in fig 2 and table 4 the exact neural network architecture is as follows the input layer is a matrix of feature vector of stowage samples the output layer is the approximate q value of each action thus the number of nodes in input layer is 11 the number of nodes in output layer is 3 there are 2 hidden layers in this case and the first and second hidden layer are both fully connected and consists of 7 and 5 units respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of rainfall forecast statistical indices for the daily rainfall forecasting performance of various rainfall levels with a lead time of 7 days in the growth period for three types of rice are presented in fig 3 for all types of rice fig 3a shows that the average threat score ts of different precipitation grades ranged between 0 38 and 0 70 and that the ts of all precipitation grades and average ts decreased with increasing lead times a significant difference was found among the rice types in that the ts of early rice was the lowest followed by that of middle rice and late rice for different precipitation grades the ts of forecasts with no rainfall is significantly higher than that of forecasts with rainfall and the ts decreased with increasing rainfall level fig 3b c also showed that the average missing alarm rate mar and false alarm rate far ranged from 0 20 to 0 39 and 0 14 to 0 49 respectively the mar and far of all precipitation grades and the average mar and far decreased with increasing lead times similar to ts the mar and far of early rice were the highest followed by those of middle rice and late rice a clear increasing trend is observed for mar and far with increasing rainfall level except that the trends of hr and sr were almost zero for certain lead times due to low frequency of occurrence in general the performance of the rainfall forecasts varied greatly in time and precipitation grades and the rainfall forecasts performed worse with increasing lead time and rainfall level which was in agreement with results obtained in previous studies luo et al 2016 cao et al 2019 these results suggested that the daily rainfall forecasting performance was acceptable and that potentially uncertain rainfall exists for learning and utilization 3 2 performance evaluation of dqn irrigation decision making strategy loss is the objective function value during neural network training eq 22 representing the degree to which the neural network approximates the discrete action value as shown in fig 4a c the loss was large at the beginning because the information was insufficient to approximate satisfactorily and subsequently decreased rapidly in 100 iterations after approximately 500 2000 iterations the parameters of each iteration differed less the loss value tended to be stable and fluctuating and the neural network could better approach the action value under various states slightly different from the loss function the mean reward first decreased slightly and then increased dramatically because at first the exploration strategy was more frequently used to obtain an adequate sample of reward values on every state i e exploration rate ε εmin which was likely to perform unreasonable action with less reward and then the exploitation strategy was adopted in deciding on the action with highest reward after approximately 200 1000 iterations of each rice type the mean reward increased significantly and stabilized as for decomposed rewards the average values of basic reward r 0 rainfall utilization reward r 1 and yield reward r 2 of samples that h hmin were calculated because the proportion of samples that h hmin was significantly large but the learning rules were simple and the reward values were concentrated eqs 15 18 which made it likely to blur the learning performance of samples that h hmin when calculating the mean reward as can be seen from fig 4d l basic reward rainfall utilization reward and yield reward had some extreme high and low points at the beginning of training since the model was taking the random exploration strategy and adopting unreasonable strategy frequently which led to over irrigation r 1 1 r 2 1 and potential yield loss r 1 1 r 2 1 then r 0 r 1 and r 2 rapidly converged and increased indicating that the model started to optimize the strategy according to the feedback rewards r 0 was in a steady rise in the middle and late stage which proved that r 0 had a large learning space and was optimized steadily while r 1 showed a slow and slightly decreasing trend in the middle and late period unlike r 1 r 2 rose slowly in the late period the reason why the trends of r 1 and r 2 were different in the middle and late period might be the checks and balances between r 1 and r 2 to be more specific the increase of r 1 will lead to the decrease of r 2 therefore the advantages and disadvantages will be automatically weighed in the training and the improvement of rainfall utilization rate will be marginally sacrificed to ensure no yield reduction table 5 shows that the average reward on the verification set was not much different from the average reward on the training set indicating that the model had a strong generalization ability and can be used to make irrigation decisions with future weather forecasts it is worth noting that there are a number of important differences in the trend of reward function among early rice middle rice and late rice because the focus of the reward function was to maximize rainfall use efficiency and to avoid the yield loss with increasing rainfall the probability of drainage increased and the rainfall utilization reward was less than 1 when drainage occurred while the probability of drought decreased and the yield reward was less than 1 when water deficit occurred thus the value of the reward function had a certain correlation with rainfall in the rice growth period which showed that the rainfall utilization reward of early rice with a large amount of rainfall was lower and more scattered than that of middle rice and late rice with less rainfall whereas yield reward of early rice was more concentrated and larger than that of middle rice and late rice 3 3 analysis of the water saving effect of the dqn irrigation decision making strategy the results of the dqn irrigation strategy compared with the results of the conventional irrigation strategy showed obvious decreases in the amount of irrigation water fig 5a1 c1 irrigation timings fig 5a2 c2 and drainage water fig 5a3 c3 without yield losses i e the rate of yield losses in the simulation is equal to 0 fig 5a1 c1 show that the dqn irrigation strategy could further conserve irrigation water with an average decrease of 23 mm compared with the conventional irrigation strategy the average water saving rates of early rice middle rice and late rice were 23 6 and 3 and the standard deviations were 12 4 and 4 respectively indicating a significant difference among different rice varieties and years possibly caused by the distinct precipitation distributions and weather forecast patterns during the growth period of the three types of rice during the early rice growth period usually from april to july with abundant rainfall and lower crop water demand for lower temperature early rice only needed minimal irrigation to grow properly thus delaying irrigation to use future rainfall can conserve a large proportion of irrigation water consumption moreover unpredicted rainfall a high mar was found in 3 1 was likely to occur during this period and this unexpected rainfall can be used as supplementary irrigation by learning and training the data via the dqn algorithm during the growth period of middle rice from may to october much rainfall occurred but the crop water demand was also high requiring substantial irrigation therefore the impact of rainfall on irrigation was weakened making the water saving effect inferior to that of early rice during the growth period of late rice from july to october although the water demand of rice decreased due to the decrease in temperature there was less rainfall that could be used as supplementary irrigation due to the significant decrease of rainfall and thus the water saving effect was the least fig 5a2 c2 show that the dqn irrigation strategy reduced irrigation timings with an average decrease of 0 98 compared with the conventional irrigation strategy the proportion of reduction of irrigation times was different across rice varieties and irrigation timings of early rice decreased more than that of middle rice and late rice there were 1 4 31 0 6 5 and 1 3 9 irrigation timing reductions and 0 6 0 9 and 0 4 standard deviations in early rice middle rice and late rice respectively fig 5a3 c3 show that the dqn irrigation strategy reduced drainage water with an average decrease of 21 mm compared with the conventional irrigation strategy the amounts of drainage water of early rice middle rice and late rice were reduced by 7 8 and 9 with standard deviations of 7 8 and 11 respectively simulation results showed that applying dqn irrigation strategy did not result in yield losses in any given year not only because the reward function took into account the influence of yield but also because the lower limit of local traditional irrigation criteria was relatively high even if irrigation is delayed occasionally there would be no water deficit affecting the crop evapotranspiration resulting in the yield loss therefore dqn irrigation decision based on flooded irrigation can be regarded as a relatively safe irrigation strategy and has the potential to further save water the variations in the water saving effect among rice types supported evidence for previous observations e g cai et al 2011 gowing and ejieji 2001 which found that using the short term weather forecasts in wet years could be beneficial due to cost and water savings from unnecessary irrigation however in average and dry years profits could derive from improved efficiency in the use of a limited water supply correspondingly this study showed that the performance of the dqn irrigation strategy for early rice was better than that of middle rice and late rice the rainfall of which was less than that of early rice it should be noted that although the costs of irrigation were not included in the dqn model as a limitation of this study the irrigation timings could indirectly reflect the input of irrigation management the value of the action value function q for each action in the three types of rice under the same criterion of field water depth is shown in fig 6 a reasonable increase occurred in the average q value with the increase in water depth of the field in the case of taking action 0 whereas a decrease in the average q value was found with an increase in water depth of the field in the case of taking action 1 or 2 and the q value of action 2 was always higher than that of action 1 because the r1 rainfall utilization reward of the reward function for action 2 was higher than that of action 1 when h hmin for reducing the frequency of irrigation additionally the average q values of action 0 and action 2 were approximately equal at h 20 mm i e hmin when predicted precipitation is approximately equal to 0 which indicated that dqn was able to learn the basic irrigation rule that paddy rice should be irrigated when the water depth of the field reached the lower limit of water depth considering the future rainfall when h hmin the q value was generally at a relatively high stage if taking action 0 but at a low stage if taking action 1 or 2 when h hmin the q value of action 0 increased with the increase in predicted rainfall whereas the q values of action 1 and action 2 decreased with the increase in predicted rainfall it is worth noting that the above patterns were most obvious in early rice followed by middle rice and the least in late rice which was related to the rainfall during the growth period of paddy rice it is clear that less rainfall during the growth period of paddy rice gives less information on rainfall in the corresponding weather forecasts therefore there were insufficient samples containing key information i e samples for which rain is predicted in the future in the model during training thus the q value distribution of the late rice model was not as obvious as that of the middle rice and late rice models in addition the forecast frequencies of various rainfall grades within 1 7 days of each action when h hmin were analyzed fig 7 the results showed that the average grade for the rainfall forecast of early rice was the highest i e the average color was deepest followed by middle rice and late rice although the q value of action 1 was always lower than that of action 2 with the same amount of predicted rainfall and the same criterion of field water depth see fig 6 there were still cases of action 1 except for late rice due to random distribution of rainfall it is apparent from this figure that the average grade for the rainfall forecast of action 0 was higher than that of action 1 and 2 as the forecast lead time increased a decreasing trend was noted in the average grade for the rainfall forecasts of action 0 an increasing trend occurred in that of action 2 and the average grade for the rainfall forecasts of action 1 first increased and subsequently decreased these results indicated that the future rainfall was considered in the model when the field needed irrigation the dqn model chose to delay irrigation to avoid over irrigation leading to wasted water if heavy rainfall was expected in the short term future in 1 3 days alternatively the model chose to reduce the amount of irrigation water if rainfall was expected in the middle term future in 4 5 days to relieve the crop from drought and reduce water waste or chose to irrigate immediately according to the conventional rules if there was rainfall in the long term future in 6 7 days or almost no forecast rainfall in the next 7 days these results are in accordance with the irrigation rules developed by cao et al 2019 it is worth noting that the rainfall forecasts were not involved in the reward function of the dqn model it is possible to hypothesize that even though the model did not directly determine which decision to make in a specific situation the model obtained feedback through the interaction with the environment and continuously took advantage of implicit domain knowledge thus summarizing the irrigation experience in the manner of experts this paper proposed a reinforcement learning approach to irrigation decision making for rice using weather forecasts certain limitations exist with respect to both sample size and station selection first unlike traditional machine learning projects such as autonomous driving and game development which can produce data artificially only historical information collected from meteorological data and weather forecast data were used in training in this study although the meteorological data and weather forecast data from three meteorological stations near nanchang were collected to increase the number of samples in the training set an obvious gap still existed compared with the large amount of data in traditional machine learning projects and thus limitation could reduce the training effect of this new method therefore improving the utilization of samples should be a topic of future research second only nanchang a typical rice growing area in china was selected for verification in this paper without consideration of the spatial variability in climate and soil conditions thus more typical stations should be included to assess the spatial variability performance for the proposed method in terms of practical application this research only discussed the water saving effect of the irrigation decision for a single station for a small size irrigated area with quick response to irrigation this approach can be directly applied to improve the utilization rate of rainfall and increase irrigation profits however for large size irrigated areas the water saving effect of irrigation decisions is limited by multi level constraints such as water distribution efficiency and available water supply therefore in the process of practical application this proposed method should be embedded into irrigation scheduling optimization of large size irrigated areas as one a sub goal 4 conclusions in this study an dqn irrigation decision making strategy suitable for paddy rice was proposed using weather forecasts and nanchang station in southern china was selected to validate the strategy the forecasting performance of daily rainfall for lead times of 1 7 days was evaluated for three types of rice and the training process and generalization of the dqn were discussed the water saving effects of the dqn irrigation decision and those of the conventional irrigation decision were compared the results indicated that the ts of rainfall in the weather forecasts ranged from 0 38 to 0 70 with a certain degree of false alarms and missed alarms which showed that weather forecasts can be used as reliable inputs for the proposed dqn irrigation decision making strategy the training process of the dqn algorithm converged rapidly and the nonobvious difference between the average reward of the training set and that of the verification set showed that the strategy had a strong generalization ability and can be used to make irrigation decisions with future weather forecasts in our case simulated results of dqn algorithm indicated that compared with conventional irrigation decisions the dqn strategy can conserve irrigation water by 23 mm and reduce drainage water by 21 mm and irrigation timing by 1 0 on average without yield reduction theoretically considering the risk of irrigation water waste and yield reduction the results also showed that the dqn strategy was able to summarize the past irrigation experiences after training and select the most appropriate irrigation decisions based on current field water conditions and forecast rainfall patterns thereby increasing rainfall utilization and conserving irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10122,improving efficiency with the use of rainfall is one of the effective ways to conserve water in agriculture at present weather forecasting can be used to potentially conserve irrigation water but the risks of unnecessary irrigation and the yield loss due to the uncertainty of weather forecasts should be avoided thus a deep q learning dqn irrigation decision making strategy based on short term weather forecasts was proposed to determine the optimal irrigation decision the utility of the method is demonstrated for paddy rice grown in nanchang china the short term weather forecasts and observed meteorological data of the paddy rice growth period from 2012 to 2019 were collected from stations near nanchang irrigation was decided for two irrigation decision making strategies namely conventional irrigation i e flooded irrigation commonly used by local farmers and dqn irrigation and their performance in water conservation was evaluated the results showed that the daily rainfall forecasting performance was acceptable with potential space for learning and exploitation the dqn irrigation strategy had strong generalization ability after training and can be used to make irrigation decisions using weather forecasts in our case simulation results indicated that compared with conventional irrigation decisions dqn irrigation took advantage of water conservation from unnecessary irrigation resulting in irrigation water savings of 23 mm and reducing drainage by 21 mm and irrigation timing by 1 0 times on average without significant yield reduction the dqn irrigation strategy of learning from past irrigation experiences and the uncertainties in weather forecasts avoided the risks of imperfect weather forecasting keywords reinforcement learning irrigation decision making paddy rice irrigation weather forecasts 1 introduction rice is one of the major grain crops in china comprising approximately 30 million hectares of the planting area nbsprc 2019 as a water loving crop rice needs a large amount of fresh water for irrigation during its growth although the water resources in china are abundant they are distributed unevenly in time and space and do not match perfectly with the rice irrigation demand in addition with rapidly increasing industrial and domestic water consumption the amount of agricultural water resources has decreased and water scarcity has become a threat to irrigated rice driving calls for constant development of new methods of irrigation aimed at increasing the efficiency of allocated irrigation water mao 2002 an important attempt to achieve this goal is linked to the improvement in rainfall use efficiency using rainfall information in weather forecasts to make irrigation decisions can conserve irrigation water in recent years public weather forecasts mishra et al 2013 lorite et al 2015 luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 traore et al 2016 and numerical weather forecasts perera et al 2014 medina et al 2018 have been applied to determine reference evapotranspiration et0 in the development of irrigation schedules however these researches did not consider future rainfall and a large difference was observed between the et0 and actual irrigation demand making it difficult to put into practice therefore certain studies incorporated the et0 and precipitation forecasts for irrigation demand predictions perera et al 2016 longo minnolo et al 2020 the literature is rich in setting decision rules for determining the irrigated time and amount by using short term weather forecasts cao et al 2019 cai et al 2011 gowing and ejieji 2001 linker and sylaios 2016 bergez and garcia 2010 however one major issue in previous studies is that the risks due to the uncertainties in weather forecasts i e unnecessary irrigation applied to the field because of unexpected rainfall and potential yield reduction if irrigation is delayed should be considered in making irrigation decisions using weather forecasts mondaca duarte et al 2020 when considering the balance between crop yield and water saving most studies normally focus on short term risks by applying a strategy that delays irrigation or removes the expected rainfall from the irrigation water and simply simulates the loss of yield using the average historical data or does not give sufficient consideration to yield thus failing to obtain the long term effects of current irrigation decisions which makes it difficult to obtain the global optimal solution for rice irrigation decision optimization the irrigation decision must determine the timing and amount of irrigation applied to the field which can be formulated as a markov decision process i e the future state is only related to the current state lee et al 1991 reinforcement learning rl a machine learning method that uses rewards obtained in the process of interaction with the environment to guide behavior and constantly learns a strategy to maximize the ultimate cumulative rewards is suitable for decision making process with the markov property sutton and barto 2018 as a branch of rl the deep q learning network dqn combines the perception ability of deep learning and its own decision making ability mnih et al 2013 and can supply new solutions to cognitive decision making problems in complex states as a new method in computer science rl has been widely used in prediction görges 2017 intelligent control chen and su 2018 decision support shen et al 2017 wu et al 2018 and many other fields but less attention has been given to irrigation management bergez et al 2001 compared the dynamic programming dp and rl methods for the identification of optimal initial irrigation strategies with limited irrigation water for maize crops coupled with a stochastic random weather generator the results showed that rl performed better than dp when only a small number of simulation runs were available irukula 2015 optimized the water consumption as much as possible without affecting the crop yield by using the rl algorithm on a maize crop simulation model according to daily conditions such as temperature solar radiation rainfall and soil water content a decrease in water consumption of almost 40 was achieved compared with the constant irrigation method and without any significant decrease in yield and leaf area index bu and wang 2019 designed a smart agriculture internet of things iot system based on deep reinforcement learning and presented several representative deep reinforcement learning models the reviewed water resources studies used rl as a heuristic decision optimization method focusing on use of real time data collected from the farmland or simulator without considering the future rainfall information contained in a weather forecast with the improvement in weather forecast quality use of the reinforcement learning method can excavate hidden information and improve rainfall use efficiency in this paper a rl approach based on the dqn was proposed for irrigation decision making using weather forecasting this approach is known as the dqn irrigation decision making strategy dqn irrigation strategy and the paddy rice of nanchang a typical rice planting area of china was chosen as a case study for validation the rainfall forecast is the main variable of the dqn irrigation strategy and its accuracy has a great influence on the strategy performance therefore we first evaluated the forecasting performance of daily rainfall for lead times of 1 7 days and a simple water balance model and a crop water production function used to simulate the real state of the paddy rice and field were integrated with the dqn algorithm for irrigation decision making the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate the quality of the short term public weather forecasts for different types of paddy rice in different periods in nanchang 2 to propose a reinforcement learning strategy based on dqn for irrigation decision making and to analyze its training and generalization results and 3 to verify the effect of this proposed strategy in conventional flooded irrigation in terms of water conservation and drainage reduction and to preliminarily illustrate how the proposed method saves water by considering the rainfall forecast 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data paddy rice is mainly distributed in southern china and includes double season rice early rice and late rice and single season rice middle rice in this study data from nanchang in southern china on double season rice and single season rice were used to verify the proposed method fig 1 to increase the number of samples in the training set the daily observed meteorological data of the paddy rice growing period at three stations near nanchang from 2012 to 2019 table 1 were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma gov cn including daily minimum and maximum temperature average temperature average wind speed sunshine duration mean relative humidity and precipitation the weather type of the public weather forecast data that contained rainfall information with a 7 day lead time for the same period was collected from weather china http www weather com cn noting that the observed and forecast weather data for certain periods were incomplete the data in 2012 for the early rice growth period and the data in 2014 for the middle rice and late rice growth period were not included in this study the data from 2012 to 2018 were set as the training set and the data of 2019 were set as the verification set information on agricultural management from 2012 to 2019 in nanchang was obtained from field experiments and included phenological data crop coefficients and irrigation scheduling the growth period of paddy rice was divided into six stages the returning green rg early tillering et late tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mi and yellow ripe yr stages all types of rice were assumed to apply the conventional flooded irrigation regime according to the experience in irrigation from local farmers and the crop coefficients and the criteria of field water depth in each growth stage of paddy rice are shown in table 2 2 2 evaluation of weather forecasting previous studies reported that uncertainties exist in the application of weather forecasting to irrigation or evapotranspiration forecasting luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 cao et al 2019 to evaluate the performance of weather forecasting the threat score ts missing alarm rate mar and false alarm rate far were used donaldson et al 1975 wilks 2006 1 t s n a n a n b n c 2 m a r n c n a n c 3 f a r n b n a n b where na is the number of hits i e the days that both forecasts and observations fall in the prescribed threshold ranges nb is the number of false alarms i e the days that the forecast falls in the threshold ranges but the observation does not and nc is the number of misses i e the days that the forecast falls outside the threshold range and the observation falls inside the threshold range according to the cumulative rainfall over 24 h the weather type was divided into 5 categories and the threshold values for no rain nr light rain lr moderate rain mr heavy rain hr storm or above st were set as 0 0 1 0 1 10 10 25 25 50 and 50 mm respectively it is worth noting that the type of storm or above in this case was composed of storms heavy storms and severe storms due to the low probability of individual occurrences 2 3 determination of crop evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration is estimated by allen et al 1998 4 e t c k c k s e t 0 where k c is the single crop coefficient k s is the water stress coefficient for soil water limiting conditions k s 1 otherwise k s 1 and et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day reference evapotranspiration is a key parameter to compute crop water requirement determine irrigation schedule and conduct reasonable farmland water management at present there are many calculation methods for example hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 blaney criddle blaney and criddle 1962 mccloud mccloud 1955 and other temperature based methods irmak allen irmak et al 2003 and other empirical methods priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 and other radiation based method fao24 penman doorenbos and pruitt 1975 fao56 penman manteith allen et al 1998 and other synthesis methods as the fao56 penman manteith method has a high precision and a solid application foundation and all the meteorological variables needed can be obtained therefore in this case fao56 penman manteith method was selected for reference evapotranspiration and it can be expressed as 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s

height of 2 m m s 1 e s is the vapor pressure of the air at saturation kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the water stress coefficient is given by allen et al 1998 6 k s 1 0 d r r a w t a w d r t a w r a w d r r a w where d r is the root zone depletion expressing water content in the root zone i e water shortage relative to field capacity d r 0 at field capacity mm taw is the total available soil water in the zone mm and raw is the readily available soil water in the root zone mm taw and raw

soil type e g 0 16 at clay loam 2 4 crop water production function when the weather forecast information is considered in irrigation scheduling irrigation might be delayed to wait for rainfall in the forecast resulting in water deficit and leading to yield reduction to evaluate the effect of water deficit on crop yield the crop water production function was used to establish the functional relationship between water deficit and yield at a specific growth stage according to previous studies paddy rice in southern china usually adopts the jenson model jensen 1968 to quantify the effect the model is expressed as 9 y a y m i 1 n e t a e t m i λ i where y a is the actual crop yield y m is the maximum crop yield et a is the actual crop evapotranspiration et m is the maximum crop evapotranspiration n is the number of growth stages i is the ordinal number of the growth stage i 1 2 n and λ i is the water stress sensitivity index at growth stage i in this study the values of λ i for the three rice types were derived from the literature as shown in table 3 luo 2003 2 5 dqn algorithm for irrigation decision a markov property is present in the process of irrigation decision making the irrigation decision is made based on soil water content and crop condition in the observation stage it is obvious that the state of the soil system and the crop condition at the current moment is only related to the state of the soil system climatic conditions crop conditions and the decision adopted the amount of irrigation water at the previous moment thus rl was introduced to solve the irrigation decision problem with the markov property 2 5 1 environment of rl rl refers to a method of machine learning in which an agent interacts with an environment through a sequence of observations actions and rewards the goal of the agent is to find an optimal policy that selects actions in a fashion that maximizes cumulative future rewards the environment of reinforcement can be expressed as 10 e s a p r where s is the state space a is the action space p is the transition probability and r is the reward function state space consists of the environmental parameters in the decision making cycle of the area to be irrigated i e a certain day in the growing period of crops and it can be expressed as 11 s t p t h t h min h max h p where p t is the forecast rainfall sequence for the next 7 days on day t mm h t is the water depth on day t mm h min is the lower limit of water depth mm h max is the upper limit of water depth mm h p is the maximum allowable water depth after rainfall and the value of h min h max and h p are updated in accordance with the growth period of day t see table 2 action space is the option of irrigation decision making in this case there are 3 possible actions that represent the proportion of the irrigation quota irrigate until h max to be supplied to the field on day t action 0 supplies 0 action 1 supplies 50 and action 2 supplies 100 the transition probability is the probability that makes the environment move from the current state to another state after the irrigation decision is executed including evapotranspiration update forecast weather data update and change in depth of water the change of water depth is expressed as 12 m t h max h t a t 0 1 2 h max h t a t 1 h t a t 2 13 h t 1 h t m t where m t is the amount of irrigation water on day t mm h t 1 is the depth of water on day t 1 mm after executing action a t at state s t actual meteorological and field conditions are observed and the environmental state parameters including actual evapotranspiration and water depth should be modified the modifier formula of water depth can be expressed as 14 h t 1 h t 1 p t 1 e t c t f t h t 1 p t 1 e t c t f t h p h p h t 1 p t 1 e t c t f t h p where h t 1 is the actual depth of water on day t 1 mm and p t 1 et c t and f t are the actual rainfall evapotranspiration and deep percolation on day t respectively mm in this study the daily deep percolation was set as a constant value the value for clay loam was set as 2 mm before the field water was depleted otherwise the value was set as zero the reward function is the reward feedback when the environment moves from the current state to another state after the irrigation decision is executed in this case the reward function consists of multiplying three subfunctions as follows 15 r t r 0 t r 1 t r 2 t where r 0 t represents the basic reward r 1 t represents the rainfall utilization reward and r 2 t represents the yield reward r 1 t is expressed as 16 r 1 t e t c t t 7 f t t 7 p t t 7 m t h t h t 7 where et c t t 7 f t t 7 and p t t 7 are the cumulative amount of actual evapotranspiration deep percolation and rainfall in the next 7 days from day t to day t 7 after executing action a t for example a 7 day observation was conducted from day t if taking action 2 the water was filled to the upper limit of water depth i e m t h max h t and drainage occurred if the depth of the water layer reached the maximum allowable water depth after the rainfall h p otherwise no other operation was performed the total amount of all indicators within 7 days was recorded where h t 7 is the water depth at the end of day t 7 the value of r 1 t represents the impact of irrigation decisions on rainfall utilization if no drainage event occurs r 1 t is equal to 1 which means all rainfall is used for field consumption and there is no waste of water caused by rainfall after irrigation otherwise r 1 t is less than 1 which means that drainage wastes part of the rainfall and reduces rainfall utilization r 2 t is expressed as 17 r 2 t e t c t t 7 e t m t t 7 λ where et m t t 7 represents the cumulative amount of actual evapotranspiration from non stressed treatment in the next 7 days from day t to day t 7 after executing action at λ is water stress sensitivity index in accordance with growth period of day t see table 3 the value of r 2 t represents the influence of irrigation decisions on yields if r 2 t is less than 1 after a specific decision is made e g action a 2 it indicates that crops will suffer from water deficit in the next few days resulting in the yield loss otherwise this irrigation decision has no adverse effect on crop yield r 0 t is expressed as 18 r 0 t 1 a t 0 a t 1or2 h t h min h t h min 9 a t 1 h t h min 10 a t 0 a t 2 h t h min h t h min the value of r 0 t represents whether the irrigation decision conforms to the irrigation baseline according to the depth of traditional irrigation criteria eq 18 indicates that if the basic principle of traditional irrigation is violated e g irrigating before reaching the lower limit of water depth there will be a small reward i e 1 moreover we believe that when the water depth in the field reaches the lower limit of water depth and irrigation is required taking action a1 should receive a smaller reward than action a2 this difference of 1 is set to compensate for rising costs since action a1 i e small irrigation quota will increase the irrigation times to some extent it is worthwhile noting that r 0 t will only be determined according to eq 18 if there is no drainage in the next 7 days after irrigation namely r 1 1 otherwise r 0 1 because when drainage events occur we want the irrigation decision should be based on the balance of rainfall utilization reward and yield reward without being constrained by irrigation baseline to evaluate the strategy the action value function q was used to represent the accumulated value of the long term expected reward sutton and barto 2018 given policy π for irrigation decision making the q for selecting action a under input sate s can be defined as 19 q π s a ε π t 0 γ i r t i s t s a t a where γ is the discount factor and is set as 0 2 in this case i is the number of subsequent execution steps and s a is the joint vector of state and action the optimal q function q can be defined as 20 q s a max π q π s a the optimal stationary policy is 21 π s arg max a a q s a 2 5 2 deep q learning network algorithm when reinforcement model is complete known that is every part of eq 17 is known reinforcement learning problems can be transformed into optimal control problems i e model based reinforcement problem the model based reinforcement problems i e where the transition probability set is given can be solved efficiently by dynamic programming techniques however the transition probability set of our irrigation model is not completely given i e uncertainties exist related to rainfall in the future on the other hand the traditional reinforcement learning approach is usually designed for discrete cases while the water depth and precipitation are not distributed discretely in other words certain issues are associated with the continuous state space to address the continuous state space and enhance the learning speed we leverage deep neural network dnn technology to realize a deep q learning network algorithm for irrigation decision making according to basic q learning algorithm q should be updated by the following equation known as off policy temporal difference learning watkins and dayan 1992 22 q s t a t q s t a t α r t γ max a t 1 q s t 1 a t 1 q s t a t where α is the learning rate and is set as 0 001 0 0003 and 0 0002 for early rice middle rice and late rice respectively to deal with the continuous state space a neural network function approximator with weight θ was used as a q network mnih et al 2015 this approximator can be trained by minimizing a sequence of loss functions l k θ k that changes at each iteration k and the loss function is defined as 23 l k θ k ε r γ max a t 1 q s t 1 a t 1 θ k q s t a t θ k 2 where r γ max q s t 1 a t 1 θ k is the target of iteration k θ k is the parameter used to compute the target network and θ k is the parameter of the q network of iteration k the target network parameter θ k is only updated with the q network parameter θ k every c steps thus the update of action value function is adjusted by updating the q network parameter as 24 θ k 1 θ k α θ k l k θ k the partial in the θ k direction is defined as 25 θ k l k θ k ε r γ max a t 1 q s t 1 a t 1 θ k q s t a t θ k θ k q s t a t θ k in training the neural network to avoid a sub optimal policy in which the agent does not have the opportunity to sample state actions with higher returns an ε greedy policy was used that selects the action that maximizes q s t a t θ k with probability 1 ε or a random action with probability ε additionally to ensure the convergence and stability of neural network training dqn introduced the so called experience replay mnih et al 2015 to break the connection among data and to make better use of historical data samples i e the agent stored data in a database in the process of reinforcement learning and subsequently used the uniform random sampling method to extract data from the database to a minibatch and the state of each episode was initialized randomly at the training stage to avoid model uncertainties caused by initial conditions li et al 2009 finally the extracted data were used to train the neural network as shown in fig 2 and table 4 the exact neural network architecture is as follows the input layer is a matrix of feature vector of stowage samples the output layer is the approximate q value of each action thus the number of nodes in input layer is 11 the number of nodes in output layer is 3 there are 2 hidden layers in this case and the first and second hidden layer are both fully connected and consists of 7 and 5 units respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of rainfall forecast statistical indices for the daily rainfall forecasting performance of various rainfall levels with a lead time of 7 days in the growth period for three types of rice are presented in fig 3 for all types of rice fig 3a shows that the average threat score ts of different precipitation grades ranged between 0 38 and 0 70 and that the ts of all precipitation grades and average ts decreased with increasing lead times a significant difference was found among the rice types in that the ts of early rice was the lowest followed by that of middle rice and late rice for different precipitation grades the ts of forecasts with no rainfall is significantly higher than that of forecasts with rainfall and the ts decreased with increasing rainfall level fig 3b c also showed that the average missing alarm rate mar and false alarm rate far ranged from 0 20 to 0 39 and 0 14 to 0 49 respectively the mar and far of all precipitation grades and the average mar and far decreased with increasing lead times similar to ts the mar and far of early rice were the highest followed by those of middle rice and late rice a clear increasing trend is observed for mar and far with increasing rainfall level except that the trends of hr and sr were almost zero for certain lead times due to low frequency of occurrence in general the performance of the rainfall forecasts varied greatly in time and precipitation grades and the rainfall forecasts performed worse with increasing lead time and rainfall level which was in agreement with results obtained in previous studies luo et al 2016 cao et al 2019 these results suggested that the daily rainfall forecasting performance was acceptable and that potentially uncertain rainfall exists for learning and utilization 3 2 performance evaluation of dqn irrigation decision making strategy loss is the objective function value during neural network training eq 22 representing the degree to which the neural network approximates the discrete action value as shown in fig 4a c the loss was large at the beginning because the information was insufficient to approximate satisfactorily and subsequently decreased rapidly in 100 iterations after approximately 500 2000 iterations the parameters of each iteration differed less the loss value tended to be stable and fluctuating and the neural network could better approach the action value under various states slightly different from the loss function the mean reward first decreased slightly and then increased dramatically because at first the exploration strategy was more frequently used to obtain an adequate sample of reward values on every state i e exploration rate ε εmin which was likely to perform unreasonable action with less reward and then the exploitation strategy was adopted in deciding on the action with highest reward after approximately 200 1000 iterations of each rice type the mean reward increased significantly and stabilized as for decomposed rewards the average values of basic reward r 0 rainfall utilization reward r 1 and yield reward r 2 of samples that h hmin were calculated because the proportion of samples that h hmin was significantly large but the learning rules were simple and the reward values were concentrated eqs 15 18 which made it likely to blur the learning performance of samples that h hmin when calculating the mean reward as can be seen from fig 4d l basic reward rainfall utilization reward and yield reward had some extreme high and low points at the beginning of training since the model was taking the random exploration strategy and adopting unreasonable strategy frequently which led to over irrigation r 1 1 r 2 1 and potential yield loss r 1 1 r 2 1 then r 0 r 1 and r 2 rapidly converged and increased indicating that the model started to optimize the strategy according to the feedback rewards r 0 was in a steady rise in the middle and late stage which proved that r 0 had a large learning space and was optimized steadily while r 1 showed a slow and slightly decreasing trend in the middle and late period unlike r 1 r 2 rose slowly in the late period the reason why the trends of r 1 and r 2 were different in the middle and late period might be the checks and balances between r 1 and r 2 to be more specific the increase of r 1 will lead to the decrease of r 2 therefore the advantages and disadvantages will be automatically weighed in the training and the improvement of rainfall utilization rate will be marginally sacrificed to ensure no yield reduction table 5 shows that the average reward on the verification set was not much different from the average reward on the training set indicating that the model had a strong generalization ability and can be used to make irrigation decisions with future weather forecasts it is worth noting that there are a number of important differences in the trend of reward function among early rice middle rice and late rice because the focus of the reward function was to maximize rainfall use efficiency and to avoid the yield loss with increasing rainfall the probability of drainage increased and the rainfall utilization reward was less than 1 when drainage occurred while the probability of drought decreased and the yield reward was less than 1 when water deficit occurred thus the value of the reward function had a certain correlation with rainfall in the rice growth period which showed that the rainfall utilization reward of early rice with a large amount of rainfall was lower and more scattered than that of middle rice and late rice with less rainfall whereas yield reward of early rice was more concentrated and larger than that of middle rice and late rice 3 3 analysis of the water saving effect of the dqn irrigation decision making strategy the results of the dqn irrigation strategy compared with the results of the conventional irrigation strategy showed obvious decreases in the amount of irrigation water fig 5a1 c1 irrigation timings fig 5a2 c2 and drainage water fig 5a3 c3 without yield losses i e the rate of yield losses in the simulation is equal to 0 fig 5a1 c1 show that the dqn irrigation strategy could further conserve irrigation water with an average decrease of 23 mm compared with the conventional irrigation strategy the average water saving rates of early rice middle rice and late rice were 23 6 and 3 and the standard deviations were 12 4 and 4 respectively indicating a significant difference among different rice varieties and years possibly caused by the distinct precipitation distributions and weather forecast patterns during the growth period of the three types of rice during the early rice growth period usually from april to july with abundant rainfall and lower crop water demand for lower temperature early rice only needed minimal irrigation to grow properly thus delaying irrigation to use future rainfall can conserve a large proportion of irrigation water consumption moreover unpredicted rainfall a high mar was found in 3 1 was likely to occur during this period and this unexpected rainfall can be used as supplementary irrigation by learning and training the data via the dqn algorithm during the growth period of middle rice from may to october much rainfall occurred but the crop water demand was also high requiring substantial irrigation therefore the impact of rainfall on irrigation was weakened making the water saving effect inferior to that of early rice during the growth period of late rice from july to october although the water demand of rice decreased due to the decrease in temperature there was less rainfall that could be used as supplementary irrigation due to the significant decrease of rainfall and thus the water saving effect was the least fig 5a2 c2 show that the dqn irrigation strategy reduced irrigation timings with an average decrease of 0 98 compared with the conventional irrigation strategy the proportion of reduction of irrigation times was different across rice varieties and irrigation timings of early rice decreased more than that of middle rice and late rice there were 1 4 31 0 6 5 and 1 3 9 irrigation timing reductions and 0 6 0 9 and 0 4 standard deviations in early rice middle rice and late rice respectively fig 5a3 c3 show that the dqn irrigation strategy reduced drainage water with an average decrease of 21 mm compared with the conventional irrigation strategy the amounts of drainage water of early rice middle rice and late rice were reduced by 7 8 and 9 with standard deviations of 7 8 and 11 respectively simulation results showed that applying dqn irrigation strategy did not result in yield losses in any given year not only because the reward function took into account the influence of yield but also because the lower limit of local traditional irrigation criteria was relatively high even if irrigation is delayed occasionally there would be no water deficit affecting the crop evapotranspiration resulting in the yield loss therefore dqn irrigation decision based on flooded irrigation can be regarded as a relatively safe irrigation strategy and has the potential to further save water the variations in the water saving effect among rice types supported evidence for previous observations e g cai et al 2011 gowing and ejieji 2001 which found that using the short term weather forecasts in wet years could be beneficial due to cost and water savings from unnecessary irrigation however in average and dry years profits could derive from improved efficiency in the use of a limited water supply correspondingly this study showed that the performance of the dqn irrigation strategy for early rice was better than that of middle rice and late rice the rainfall of which was less than that of early rice it should be noted that although the costs of irrigation were not included in the dqn model as a limitation of this study the irrigation timings could indirectly reflect the input of irrigation management the value of the action value function q for each action in the three types of rice under the same criterion of field water depth is shown in fig 6 a reasonable increase occurred in the average q value with the increase in water depth of the field in the case of taking action 0 whereas a decrease in the average q value was found with an increase in water depth of the field in the case of taking action 1 or 2 and the q value of action 2 was always higher than that of action 1 because the r1 rainfall utilization reward of the reward function for action 2 was higher than that of action 1 when h hmin for reducing the frequency of irrigation additionally the average q values of action 0 and action 2 were approximately equal at h 20 mm i e hmin when predicted precipitation is approximately equal to 0 which indicated that dqn was able to learn the basic irrigation rule that paddy rice should be irrigated when the water depth of the field reached the lower limit of water depth considering the future rainfall when h hmin the q value was generally at a relatively high stage if taking action 0 but at a low stage if taking action 1 or 2 when h hmin the q value of action 0 increased with the increase in predicted rainfall whereas the q values of action 1 and action 2 decreased with the increase in predicted rainfall it is worth noting that the above patterns were most obvious in early rice followed by middle rice and the least in late rice which was related to the rainfall during the growth period of paddy rice it is clear that less rainfall during the growth period of paddy rice gives less information on rainfall in the corresponding weather forecasts therefore there were insufficient samples containing key information i e samples for which rain is predicted in the future in the model during training thus the q value distribution of the late rice model was not as obvious as that of the middle rice and late rice models in addition the forecast frequencies of various rainfall grades within 1 7 days of each action when h hmin were analyzed fig 7 the results showed that the average grade for the rainfall forecast of early rice was the highest i e the average color was deepest followed by middle rice and late rice although the q value of action 1 was always lower than that of action 2 with the same amount of predicted rainfall and the same criterion of field water depth see fig 6 there were still cases of action 1 except for late rice due to random distribution of rainfall it is apparent from this figure that the average grade for the rainfall forecast of action 0 was higher than that of action 1 and 2 as the forecast lead time increased a decreasing trend was noted in the average grade for the rainfall forecasts of action 0 an increasing trend occurred in that of action 2 and the average grade for the rainfall forecasts of action 1 first increased and subsequently decreased these results indicated that the future rainfall was considered in the model when the field needed irrigation the dqn model chose to delay irrigation to avoid over irrigation leading to wasted water if heavy rainfall was expected in the short term future in 1 3 days alternatively the model chose to reduce the amount of irrigation water if rainfall was expected in the middle term future in 4 5 days to relieve the crop from drought and reduce water waste or chose to irrigate immediately according to the conventional rules if there was rainfall in the long term future in 6 7 days or almost no forecast rainfall in the next 7 days these results are in accordance with the irrigation rules developed by cao et al 2019 it is worth noting that the rainfall forecasts were not involved in the reward function of the dqn model it is possible to hypothesize that even though the model did not directly determine which decision to make in a specific situation the model obtained feedback through the interaction with the environment and continuously took advantage of implicit domain knowledge thus summarizing the irrigation experience in the manner of experts this paper proposed a reinforcement learning approach to irrigation decision making for rice using weather forecasts certain limitations exist with respect to both sample size and station selection first unlike traditional machine learning projects such as autonomous driving and game development which can produce data artificially only historical information collected from meteorological data and weather forecast data were used in training in this study although the meteorological data and weather forecast data from three meteorological stations near nanchang were collected to increase the number of samples in the training set an obvious gap still existed compared with the large amount of data in traditional machine learning projects and thus limitation could reduce the training effect of this new method therefore improving the utilization of samples should be a topic of future research second only nanchang a typical rice growing area in china was selected for verification in this paper without consideration of the spatial variability in climate and soil conditions thus more typical stations should be included to assess the spatial variability performance for the proposed method in terms of practical application this research only discussed the water saving effect of the irrigation decision for a single station for a small size irrigated area with quick response to irrigation this approach can be directly applied to improve the utilization rate of rainfall and increase irrigation profits however for large size irrigated areas the water saving effect of irrigation decisions is limited by multi level constraints such as water distribution efficiency and available water supply therefore in the process of practical application this proposed method should be embedded into irrigation scheduling optimization of large size irrigated areas as one a sub goal 4 conclusions in this study an dqn irrigation decision making strategy suitable for paddy rice was proposed using weather forecasts and nanchang station in southern china was selected to validate the strategy the forecasting performance of daily rainfall for lead times of 1 7 days was evaluated for three types of rice and the training process and generalization of the dqn were discussed the water saving effects of the dqn irrigation decision and those of the conventional irrigation decision were compared the results indicated that the ts of rainfall in the weather forecasts ranged from 0 38 to 0 70 with a certain degree of false alarms and missed alarms which showed that weather forecasts can be used as reliable inputs for the proposed dqn irrigation decision making strategy the training process of the dqn algorithm converged rapidly and the nonobvious difference between the average reward of the training set and that of the verification set showed that the strategy had a strong generalization ability and can be used to make irrigation decisions with future weather forecasts in our case simulated results of dqn algorithm indicated that compared with conventional irrigation decisions the dqn strategy can conserve irrigation water by 23 mm and reduce drainage water by 21 mm and irrigation timing by 1 0 on average without yield reduction theoretically considering the risk of irrigation water waste and yield reduction the results also showed that the dqn strategy was able to summarize the past irrigation experiences after training and select the most appropriate irrigation decisions based on current field water conditions and forecast rainfall patterns thereby increasing rainfall utilization and conserving irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10123,declining water levels in the southern ogallala aquifer and associated reduction in irrigation capacities and increasing pumping costs necessitate adoption of deficit limited irrigation practices for sustaining cotton production in the texas high plains thp region the overall goal of this study was to evaluate the response of cotton crop to water stress in different growth stages and suggest efficient growth stage based deficit gsbd irrigation schedules for maximizing yield crop water productivity cwp and economic returns under contrasting weather conditions using the cropgro cotton model five growth stages including seedling emergence germination squaring early bloom flower initiation peak bloom and boll opening late bloom were considered a combination of five irrigation scenarios s1 through s5 with seasonal irrigation amounts of 240 300 360 420 and 480 mm and six irrigation treatments t1 through t5 no irrigation in one of the five growth stages and t6 irrigation applied in all five growth stages were then simulated with a center pivot irrigation system skipping irrigation during the peak bloom growth stage t4 treatment resulted in the lowest yield cwp and net returns under all weather conditions the t1 irrigation treatment in which irrigation was skipped during the seedling emergence germination stage was identified as the most efficient irrigation strategy for maximizing yield cwp and net returns among all irrigation scenarios application of more than 360 420 and 480 mm of irrigation water in wet normal and dry years respectively did not significantly improve yield or net returns and resulted in a decrease in cwp these results imply that cotton responses to water deficit vary by growth stages and adoption of appropriate gsbd irrigation strategies could optimize the use of limited water resources and extend the life of the southern ogallala aquifer graphical abstract ga1 keywords cropgro cotton deficit irrigation dssat irrigation economics ogallala aquifer texas high plains 1 introduction irrigated agriculture in many parts of the world is facing key sustainability issues due to rapidly growing population and declining water availability texas high plains thp is one of such regions where producers are finding it difficult to provide full irrigation to meet crop water needs due to continuously declining water levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer which is the largest aquifer in the united states scanlon et al 2012 availability of groundwater in the southern portion of this aquifer is critical to the economy of the thp region as about 93 of the total water use in this region comes from this aquifer weinheimer et al 2013 o shaughnessy et al 2020 about 95 of the water mined from this highly depleted aquifer is used for irrigated agriculture twdb 2020 as ogallala aquifer is the primary source of irrigation water in this region the effect of groundwater pumping for crop production on the decline of groundwater levels in the aquifer is much severe in dry years especially in the southern portion of the aquifer chaudhuri and ale 2014a scanlon et al 2012 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is the main irrigated crop in the thp region with planted acres of about 52 of the thp s total field crop acreage usda nass 2020 irrigated cotton production in this region is facing challenges as groundwater in the southern ogallala aquifer is depleting at an unsustainable rate due to extraction far exceeding recharge scanlon et al 2012 nair et al 2013 while the average decline in groundwater level across the eight states in the ogallala aquifer region since pre development 1950 was estimated as 4 6 m 15 6 ft it was 12 5 m 41 1 ft in the thp region mcguire 2017 rapid depletion of the ogallala aquifer has not only reduced groundwater availability for irrigation mcmahon et al 2007 chaudhuri and ale 2014a 2014b himanshu et al 2019 but also increased groundwater pumping costs konikow and kendy 2005 colaizzi et al 2009 the groundwater conservation districts within the thp region have imposed limits on groundwater withdrawals to extend the life of the ogallala aquifer for example the annual groundwater pumping limit was set at 457 mm 18 in by the high plains underground water conservation district hpwd 2015 at the same time studies on climate change for the thp region project major changes in summer winter precipitation patterns and an increase in temperature in the future which could further exacerbate the existing water shortages and adversely affect crop production islam et al 2012 modala et al 2017 nielsen gammon et al 2020 production of more food from less water for a growing population is a major challenge for the agriculture sector and this could be achieved by enhancing crop water productivity cwp pabuayon et al 2019 araya et al 2019 an increase in cwp can be achieved either with more production from the same amount of water or the same production with less amount of water which can directly benefit other water users cwp can be improved with regulated deficit irrigation which strategically applies less water than required to achieve maximal yield zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 geerts and raes 2009 hunsaker et al 2015 greaves and wang 2017 shareef et al 2018 the selection of an appropriate irrigation method is also important for achieving higher cwp and this depends on several factors including climate crop and soil type topography water and labor availability energy use and cost of irrigation system due to windy conditions semi arid climate and existing water scarcity problems less efficient surface irrigation methods are not recommended for the thp region subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems are gaining popularity in this region and a carefully managed sdi system probably provides the greatest cwp due to the highest reduction in irrigation water losses however center pivot irrigation is the most commonly used irrigation method in this region and this method also has the potential to provide higher cwp zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 estimated the potential maximum global cwp of cotton as 0 33 kg m 3 however the current global cwp of cotton is 0 23 kg m 3 suggesting enormous opportunities for increasing cotton cwp with an estimated 20 40 reduction in the water use fan et al 2018 the efficiency of water use can be increased through optimal allocation of irrigation water among critical growth stages bordovsky et al 2015 greaves and wang 2017 zonta et al 2017 h li et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 these studies reported a significant reduction in yield when water deficit was imposed during peak bloom stage as compared to the deficit during early and late growth stages the amount and distribution of rainfall also affects cotton growth and yield significantly as water requirement of cotton varies widely during different growth stages fisher and udeigwe 2012 boman and warren 2014 therefore an assessment of the effects of growing season precipitation and irrigation under different growth stage based deficit gsbd irrigation strategies on crop yield cwp and net returns could assist in the identification of strategies for efficient irrigation management economics of irrigated cotton systems in the arid and semi arid regions of the united states were evaluated by several researchers bordovsky et al 2001 delaune et al 2012 mitchell mccallister et al 2020 focusing on the thp region bordovsky et al 2001 compared the profits of cotton production using low energy precision application lepa and sdi systems and reported higher net returns using lepa if the irrigation capacity was greater than 2 5 mm d 1 0 1 in d 1 delaune et al 2012 studied the effects of five irrigation regimes 0 33 66 100 and 133 et replacement on cotton production they found that maximum lint yield and net returns were achieved at 104 5 and 102 et replacement respectively while irrigation at 83 et replacement resulted in the lint yield within the 95 confidence interval mitchell mccallister et al 2020 estimated the profitability of irrigating cotton during three growing periods early vegetative reproductive and maturation based on growing degree day accumulation and found that irrigation during maturation at 6 4 mm d 1 irrigation level increased profits by 468 and 110 as compared to 0 and 3 2 mm d 1 irrigation levels respectively evaluating efficient irrigation strategies through field experiments alone is rather difficult and it is constrained by time and cost crop simulation models on the other hand are useful to evaluate efficient crop and irrigation strategies based on crop yield cwp and net returns for diverse cropping systems adhikari et al 2016 attia et al 2016 gaydon et al 2017 thorp et al 2017 himanshu et al 2019 however before application these models require a thorough evaluation based on observed data several crop growth models have been developed for assessing cotton growth development and yield under varying agro climatic conditions thorp et al 2014 among them the cropgro cotton module of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm has been widely adopted across the world for evaluating cotton production under different irrigation management approaches butter et al 2007 pathak et al 2007 modala et al 2015 mauget et al 2017 thorp et al 2017 loison et al 2017 m li et al 2019 garibay et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 ale et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in a recent study we suggested efficient gsbd irrigation strategies for increasing irrigation water use efficiency iwue while achieving higher cotton yield under different climatic conditions using an sdi system himanshu et al 2019 however as mentioned earlier center pivot irrigation systems are more commonly used in this region and sdi systems are used in less than 20 of the irrigated area while the center pivot systems irrigate about 740 000 ha within the hpwd limits sdi systems irrigate only 181 000 ha hpwd 2018 in addition the economic analysis of simulated irrigation strategies was not carried out in himanshu et al 2019 therefore the objectives of this study were to i identify critical cotton growth periods for application of irrigation using center pivot sprinkler irrigation system ii assess the long term 1977 2018 effects of gsbd irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield cwp and economic returns at halfway in the thp region and iii suggest efficient gsbd irrigation strategies for dry normal and wet weather years the csm cropgro cotton model which was previously evaluated for this study area adhikari et al 2016 was used to achieve the above objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the availability of irrigation water from the ogallala aquifer along with favorable growing conditions and fertile soils make thp one of the world s most productive agricultural regions weinheimer et al 2013 thp is also a major cotton growing region and it contributes to about 25 and 64 of the us and texas cotton production respectively mauget et al 2017 usda nass 2020 about 25 different crops are grown in this region with cotton winter wheat triticum aestivum l grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l and corn zea mays l being the primary irrigated crops the local climate is classified as semi arid and windy with large variations in daily temperature hashem et al 2020 the thp region typically receives about 200 300 mm 8 12 in of rainfall during the summer growing season weinheimer et al 2013 clay loams and sandy loams are common soil types in this region measured data from a cotton iwue field experiment conducted by bordovsky et al 2015 during 2010 2013 growing seasons at the texas a m agrilife research center at halfway 34 10 n 101 56 w elevation 1075 m in the thp was used by adhikari et al 2016 for evaluating the dssat cropgro cotton model the treatments in the iwue experiment consisted of three in season irrigation capacities of low l 0 mm d 1 medium m 3 2 mm d 1 and high h 6 4 mm d 1 applied during pre bloom peak bloom and post peak bloom growth stages these three irrigation periods were defined on the basis of accumulated growing degree days gdds at a threshold temperature of 15 6 c 2 2 crop growth simulation model the dssat csm cropgro cotton model version 4 7 was used in this study the model can simulate growth and yield responses of cotton under different crop and management strategies over time jones et al 2003 thorp et al 2014 garibay et al 2019 hoogenboom et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the model requires inputs related to weather genetic parameters soil properties and crop and irrigation management the minimum weather data required for the model include daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature and solar radiation dew point temperature relative humidity and wind speed are optional weather inputs required genetic parameters include ecotype cultivar and species coefficients defined in eco cul and spe suffixed files the model inputs related to irrigation management planting and harvesting tillage management fertilizer and chemical applications in this study were decided based on the experimental details provided in bordovsky et al 2015 additional details about the model inputs used in this study can be found in adhikari et al 2016 2 3 weather input data the daily weather data required by the model including precipitation mm maximum and minimum air temperature c wind speed m s 1 relative humidity and solar radiation mj m 2 were obtained for the period from 1977 to 2018 from an on site weather station at halfway the growing season april october and non growing season rainfall and average daily minimum and maximum growing season air temperature varied substantially during the simulation period fig 1 the average 1977 2018 growing season and annual rainfall recorded at the study site were 344 mm and 463 mm respectively the average growing season minimum and maximum temperature recorded at the study site were 12 7 c in the year 1995 and 31 7 c in the year 2011 respectively fig 1 2 4 model evaluation as mentioned earlier the dssat cropgro cotton model used in this study was previously evaluated for the study site by adhikari et al 2016 based on the measured data from bordovsky et al 2015 cotton iwue experiment during four growing seasons from 2010 to 2013 twenty seven irrigation treatments were implemented in the field experiment the model was calibrated using measured data from 4 high irrigation treatments and it was evaluated using measured data from the remaining 23 low and medium irrigation treatments the measured and simulated dates of onset of different phenological stages and seed cotton yields matched well during model calibration and evaluation adhikari et al 2016 an average percent error of 0 1 and 6 5 was estimated for cotton yield prediction during the calibration and evaluation respectively the coefficient of determination r2 in cotton yield prediction was 0 94 during both calibration and evaluation periods complete details about the model evaluation are available in adhikari et al 2016 2 5 simulated irrigation strategies the effects of gsbd irrigation strategies on cotton yield cwp and economic returns were assessed by performing long term simulations over 42 years 1977 2018 based on the four years 2010 2013 of observed records from the field experiment at halfway bordovsky et al 2015 planting and harvesting dates in each year were assumed as may 11 and november 8 respectively similar to himanshu et al 2019 study five growth stages were considered as critical for irrigation in this study i seedling emergence germination stage gs1 spanning from 3 to 17 days after planting dap during which the irrigation requirement is low ii squaring stage gs2 23 47 dap low irrigation requirement iii early bloom flower initiation stage gs3 48 72 dap moderate irrigation requirement iv peak bloom stage gs4 73 102 dap high irrigation requirement v boll opening late bloom stage gs5 103 130 dap moderate irrigation requirement five irrigation scenarios were considered in this study and the amount of irrigation water applied during the cotton growing season in those scenarios was varied from 240 to 480 mm table 1 the irrigation amount per application was kept at 24 mm with a minimum irrigation interval of four days the amount of seasonal irrigation water in each irrigation scenario was distributed among the five growth stages according to the irrigation requirement in respective growth stages fig 2 for example the greatest proportion of irrigation water was applied during the peak bloom stage when irrigation requirement was the highest fig 2 the proportion of irrigation water applied during different crop growth stages under simulated irrigation strategies are presented in fig 2 the irrigation applications within a growth period were evenly distributed on both sides of the center day for example under the first scenario s1 one irrigation was allocated for gs1 stage 3 17 dap and it was simulated on the 10th dap in the case of scenarios s2 to s5 except s2 t6 two irrigations were allocated for gs1 stage and they were applied on 8 and 12 dap irrigation was skipped on days when a significant amount of rainfall was received however the number of irrigation applications enumerated for specific growth stages was maintained by extending the period of irrigation relatively wider windows were therefore considered for all growth stages so that all of the allocated irrigations within a growth period could be simulated even in case of multiple rainy days a seasonal analysis was carried out for the long term 1977 2018 simulations by running each year s simulation independently of the previous year and initializing soil initial conditions prior to planting each year to ensure that there were no residual effects of previous years tovihoudji et al 2019 six irrigation treatments were adopted under each irrigation scenario out of the six treatments irrigation was eliminated in one of the five identified critical growth stages in treatments t1 through t5 and irrigation was applied in all growth stages in the last treatment t6 figs 2 and 3 however within an irrigation scenario the applied irrigation amount was kept the same for all irrigation treatments fig 3 irrigation treatment t6 was used as a control treatment and the effects of different gsbd irrigation strategies t1 through t5 on cotton yield and net gross returns were assessed by comparing these simulated results for respective treatments with those for the t6 treatment based on the amount of rainfall received during the growing period april to october the years in the long term simulation period of 1977 2018 were divided into dry normal and wet years for the analysis of simulated results the years with less than 277 mm 33rd percentile and greater than 366 mm 66th percentile growing season precipitation were considered dry and wet years respectively the remaining years were considered normal years the same thresholds were also chosen by himanshu et al 2019 and kothari et al 2019 for classifying simulation years into different weather variability classes the average growing season rainfall for the dry years 1980 1983 1984 1990 1993 1994 1996 1998 2000 2001 2002 2003 2011 and 2013 normal years 1977 1978 1982 1997 1999 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2012 2016 and 2018 and wet years 1979 1981 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1991 1992 1995 2004 2014 2015 and 2017 was 220 mm 322 mm and 490 mm respectively similarly the average growing season air temperature during dry normal and wet years was determined as 22 0 c 21 4 c and 21 3 c respectively efficient irrigation strategies for cotton production in the thp region under different weather conditions were finally suggested based on the simulated crop yield cwp and economic returns while considering the hpwd s annual groundwater withdrawal limit 457 mm for irrigation an irrigation strategy i e an irrigation treatment under an irrigation scenario was considered as ideal for a weather category if there was no minimal increase in mean cotton yield cwp and net returns from applying next higher irrigation amount 2 6 estimation of net depth of irrigation requirement and crop water productivity the seasonal crop water requirement cwr was estimated as the amount of water needed to meet simulated evapotranspiration requirement during the growth period the seasonal net depth of irrigation requirement nir was then calculated by subtracting seasonal rainfall from cwr based on the amount of irrigation water applied during the growing season 240 300 360 420 and 480 mm for irrigation scenarios s1 through s5 the percentage of nir met through irrigation irm was finally calculated as 1 irm applied seasonal irrigation irrigation efficiency nir 100 the irrigation efficiency of the lepa center pivot irrigation system used at the study site was assumed as 95 cwp is a robust benchmark for assessing crop production in relation to water application edreira et al 2018 cwp can be increased significantly if yields are not penalized by appropriately timed deficit irrigations zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in this study cwp kg m 3 was estimated using the following relationship playán and mateos 2006 pereira et al 2009 2012 2 c wp yield twu where yield refers to the irrigated seed cotton yield kg ha 1 and twu is the total water use which was estimated using the equation below rodrigues and pereira 2009 3 twu p i δ sw cr where p is the seasonal precipitation m3 i is the seasonal irrigation amount m3 δsw is the change in soil water content between planting and harvest m3 and cr is the capillary rise m3 since the groundwater level in the study region is greater than 60 m below the ground surface twbd 2020 the capillary rise was considered negligible in this study 2 7 economic analysis and profit estimation economic analysis was conducted using observed data from the field experiment at halfway during 2010 2013 bordovsky et al 2015 and the simulated yield data from the long term simulations 1977 2018 specifically lint and cotton seed yields were estimated from the simulated seed cotton yields using turnout ratios of 0 362 and 0 502 respectively based on the measured data at halfway the gross return in nominal value was estimated for each irrigation scenario s s 1 5 and each irrigation treatment t t 1 6 in each year r r 1977 2018 historical prices of lint and cotton

above costs were estimated using the texas a m agrilife extension service enterprise budget texas a m agrilife extension 2019 estimates for the south plains extension district 2 were used and

expenses on cotton seed fertilizers chemicals labor and fuel relating to the applications operations lubricants energy use for irrigation repairs and maintenance of machinery including irrigation systems interest insurance harvesting and hauling expenses and ginning cost 1 1 land rental was not included in the budget this research did not account for changes in technologies of cotton cultivar irrigation system fertilizers chemicals except for insecticide insecticide application changes were adjusted according to cotton leads 2018 we used an annual interest rate of 5 75 and the

discussion 3 1 impacts of simulated gsbd irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield box plots of annual yield distributions and line charts of average annual yields under different gsbd irrigation strategies during dry normal and wet years are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively due to differences in response of cotton to water deficit during different growth stages a considerable variation in yield was found among different gsbd irrigation strategies figs 4 and 5 the changes in seed cotton yield under different irrigation treatments when irrigation was skipped in a growth stage t1 through t5 as compared to t6 same quantity of irrigation water was applied but distributed to all growth stages are presented in table 2 the results show that eliminating irrigation during the initial growth stages t1 and t2 treatments resulted in a significant increase in seed cotton yield except in the case of s5 t2 when there was a slight reduction as compared to t6 when irrigation was applied in all growth stages table 2 the average yield increase among different irrigation scenarios was 18 6 9 0 and 3 7 during dry normal and wet years respectively under t1 treatment when irrigation was skipped during gs1 a similar increase in seed cotton yield of 13 9 6 0 and 2 7 was found during dry normal and wet years respectively under t2 treatment when irrigation was skipped during gs2 irrigation applications in the early growth stages of cotton can be lost via evaporation due to high temperatures in this semi arid region and hence they do not contribute to an increase in yield himanshu et al 2019 those early irrigations also result in diseases and undesirable excessive plant growth skipping irrigation in gs1 and gs2 stages potentially increased root growth and therefore water uptake and enhanced resilience of cotton to shortage of water all of these factors contributed to an increase in yield thorp et al 2017 no irrigation during the peak bloom growth stage t4 treatment resulted in the lowest seed cotton yield under all irrigation scenarios in dry normal and wet years figs 4 and 5 the yield reduction under t4 treatment was 59 3 43 3 and 17 0 during dry normal and wet years respectively when compared to t6 table 2 in general water deficit during peak bloom growth stage reduces flowering rate and boll retention and increases shedding zonta et al 2017 most reproductive structures grow and develop during this critical stage and therefore plants require more water ritchie et al 2007 numerous studies perry and barnes 2012 bordovsky et al 2015 himanshu et al 2019 have also outlined that imposing water deficit during peak bloom stage affected physiological processes and reduced crop yields significantly however as expected the effect of elimination of irrigation during the peak bloom stage on seed cotton yield was less in wet years than in dry and normal years likewise this effect was minimal under higher irrigation scenarios especially during wet years application of irrigation water in all growth stages t6 was found beneficial only in the case of s5 irrigation scenario 480 mm as indicated by higher median seed cotton yield in case of t6 treatment compared to other treatments especially during dry years fig 4 in the cases of higher irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 elimination of irrigation during gs1 to gs3 and gs5 growth stages did not significantly affect yield due to availability of enough moisture from irrigation in preceding growth stages however providing excess water in any growth stage could create excess water stress resulting in a yield loss simulated cotton yield in wet years was as expected consistently higher than that in dry and normal years fig 4 additionally in the case of wet years maximum yield was achieved with a lesser irrigation amount as compared to dry and normal years with the increase in irrigation water applied the simulated seed cotton yield increased continuously in dry years in the case of normal and wet years the simulated yield increased gradually with an increase in irrigation water application and peaked at 420 mm scenario 4 and 360 mm scenario 5 respectively and any additional irrigation resulted in no minor increase in yield fig 5 also the differences in simulated seed cotton yield among different categories of years were found to be minimum in the case of high irrigation scenarios s4 through s5 figs 4 and 5 these results indicate that the producers in the thp have the potential of achieving higher cotton yields while complying with the hpwd s annual pumping allowance 457 mm by adopting appropriate gsbd irrigation strategies especially during normal and wet years 3 2 impacts of gsbd irrigation strategies on seasonal net depth of irrigation requirement and crop water productivity the simulated seasonal cwr nir and irm under different irrigation strategies in dry normal and wet years are presented in table 3 interestingly cwr was consistently higher in wet years than in dry and normal years under all irrigation strategies as expected nir was consistently lower in wet years than in dry and normal years as the majority of cwr in wet years was met from rainfall however the irm was found to be maximum in wet years followed by normal and dry years table 3 in wet years the irm exceeded 100 when applied seasonal irrigation water was 360 mm or higher the cwr nir and irm values increased continuously from irrigation strategies s1 to s5 under different weather conditions simulated annual cwp distributions and average annual cwp under different gsbd irrigation strategies during dry normal and wet years are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively similar to yield trends a considerable difference in cwp was found among simulated irrigation strategies due to the differences in the response of cotton crop to availability of water during different growth stages snowden et al 2014 zonta et al 2017 specifically cwp was found to be the lowest in all irrigation scenarios in which irrigation was skipped during the peak bloom stage gs4 figs 6 and 7 in contrast elimination of irrigation during the initial growth stages gs1 and gs2 improved cwp when compared to applying irrigation water in all growth stages t6 treatment fig 7 the cwp increased continuously with the increase in irrigation water applied in the case of dry years in normal and wet years the cwp increased steadily until the irrigation amount reached 360 mm s3 scenario and a further increase in irrigation resulted in a slight reduction in cwp fig 7 in addition variability in the simulated cwp decreased with an increase in irrigation amount under all weather conditions and this variability was minimum in wet years this was because the benefit of irrigation water became less prominent with higher growing season precipitation received in wet years the simulated cwp was found to be consistently lower under dry weather conditions in the case of low and moderate irrigation scenarios s1 through s3 fig 7 conversely under high irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 the simulated cwp was higher in dry years except in the case of t4 treatment followed by normal years fig 7 these results indicate that higher amounts of irrigation water would be needed to improve cwp during dry years in normal and wet years however application of moderate amounts of irrigation water s3 scenario would be desirable for increasing cwp while maintaining high seed cotton yields 3 3 profitability under simulated gsbd irrigation strategies gross return production cost and net return under the simulated gsbd irrigation strategies among three weather categories are presented in fig 8 the results indicated that application of appropriate gsbd irrigation strategies could potentially improve the profitability of irrigated cotton production in the thp region depending on current practices and irrigation water availability the trends in gross return and production costs under simulated strategies were similar to those of yields in dry normal and wet years fig 8a b both gross return and production cost increased linearly in dry years with the increase in irrigation water applied in normal years the rate of increase in gross return and production cost decreased with the increase in irrigation water applied especially for t1 and t2 irrigation treatments in wet years the gross return and production cost increased gradually until the amount of irrigation water increased to 360 mm scenario s3 and thereafter the rate of increase slowed down eliminating irrigation in the peak bloom growth stage resulted in the lowest gross return and production cost in all weather conditions because low cotton yield in this treatment lowered harvesting hauling and ginning expenses and reduced income from the sale of lint and cotton seed fig 8a b the impacts of gsbd irrigation strategies on gross return and production cost were minimal under higher irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 specifically in wet years as compared to dry and normal weather conditions the gross returns and production costs were found consistently higher under wet weather conditions especially in low and medium irrigation scenarios s1 through s3 however variations in gross returns and production costs under different weather conditions were found to be small in the case of high irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 the net returns from cotton production under different gsbd irrigation strategies are shown in fig 8c the economic impact of skipping irrigation in a particular growth stage t1 through t5 in comparison to t6 i e irrigation water applied in all growth stages is presented in table 4 a significant income loss was observed when irrigation was eliminated during gs4 irrigation treatment t4 under all irrigation scenarios and categories of years table 4 on average a loss of 997 775 and 462 ha 1 was estimated during dry normal and wet years respectively for the t4 treatment when compared to their counterpart t6 treatment several other studies also reported similar results and concluded that imposing water deficit during peak bloom growth stage had a significant negative effect on crop development and yield bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 himanshu et al 2019 on the other hand eliminating irrigation during initial growth stages gs1 to gs2 resulted in a greater net return compared to the t6 treatment in which irrigation was applied in all growth stages table 4 on average a net profit of 278 179 and 98 ha 1 was estimated during dry normal and wet years respectively for the t1 treatment a slightly lower average net profit of 211 162 and 72 ha 1 was estimated during dry normal and wet years respectively for the t2 treatment compared to the t6 treatment these results are consistent with some recent studies bordovsky et al 2015 mitchell mccallister et al 2020 which showed that imposing water stress during early growth stages could potentially increase cotton root growth and resilience to water uptake during water shortage periods and thereby increase seed cotton yield and net return the net return was found to be consistently higher under wet weather conditions especially in low and medium irrigation scenarios s1 through s3 fig 8c in the case of high irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 variation in net returns among dry normal and wet years was found to be minimum like seed cotton yield the net return in dry years increased linearly with the increase in the amount of irrigation water applied in normal and wet years the net returns increased steadily until the irrigation amount was increased to 420 mm scenario s4 and 360 mm scenario s3 respectively and application of additional irrigation resulted in a minor increase in net returns especially with better performing irrigation treatments t1 and t2 fig 8 overall the irrigation treatment t1 skipping irrigation in the first growth stage was found to be the best irrigation strategy for maximizing net return followed by t2 therefore the differences in net returns across the treatments became smaller as seasonal precipitation increased from dry years to wet years and the effect of different irrigation strategies on net returns became minimal as more irrigation water was applied from s1 to s5 3 4 suggested efficient gsbd irrigation strategies for different weather conditions the ideal irrigation strategies identified for dry normal and wet years based on simulated seed cotton yields cwps and net returns are summarized in table 5 irrigation treatment t1 was identified as the best irrigation strategy for maximizing yield cwp and net return under all weather conditions fig 9 irrigation amount applied under the identified ideal irrigation strategies for normal s4 t1 and wet s3 t1 years was found to be less than the hpwd s annual groundwater pumping limit 457 mm indicating that irrigating cotton as per the suggested gsbd irrigation strategies could enable producers maximize their net returns while complying with the hpwd pumping restrictions however in the case of dry years seasonal irrigation water applied under the suggested efficient irrigation strategy s5 t1 was found to be 480 mm indicating that the potential highest yield might not be achieved in dry years without surpassing the hpwd s annual pumping allowance however with careful planning producers can save irrigation water in normal wet years and bank it for use in succeeding dry years overall application of 360 mm scenario s3 420 mm scenario s4 and 480 mm scenario s5 of irrigation water during growth stages gs2 to gs5 as per the treatment t1 in wet normal and dry years respectively could maximize seed cotton yield cwp and net returns these results indicate that the recommended optimum irrigation strategies could increase seed cotton yield by 1 6 3 9 and 5 4 during dry normal and wet years respectively as compared to treatment t6 irrigation applied in all growth stages in addition suggested irrigation strategies could provide additional profits of 37 150 and 161 ha 1 during dry normal and wet years respectively therefore the adoption of appropriate gsbd irrigation strategies based on forecasted weather conditions could save irrigation water especially during normal and wet years however as a growing season progresses changes in actual weather conditions may necessitate switching from one strategy to another for achieving optimum yield and water productivity 4 conclusions the effects of gsbd irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield cwp and economic returns were assessed and efficient irrigation strategies for cotton production under dry normal and wet weather conditions were suggested for the thp region using the dssat csm cropgro cotton model the response of cotton crop to water deficit varied substantially among growth stages and the net returns were greatly affected by the amount and distribution of irrigation water applied in different growth stages eliminating irrigation during initial growth stages gs1 to gs2 resulted in an improvement in seed cotton yield cwp and net return in contrast eliminating irrigation during the peak bloom stage gs4 resulted in the lowest yield cwp and net return net return was found to be consistently higher for wet years when compared to dry and normal years especially under low and medium irrigation strategies s1 through s3 however in the case of high irrigation strategies s4 and s5 variation in net return under different weather conditions was found to be minimum with higher precipitation the advantage of irrigation water became less prominent the irrigation treatment t1 was identified as the best gsbd irrigation treatment for maximizing the net return from irrigated cotton production overall application of 360 mm scenario s3 420 mm scenario s4 and 480 mm scenario s5 of irrigation water as per the irrigation treatment t1 in wet normal and dry years respectively was recommended to maximize seed cotton yield cwp and net return this study revealed that the recommended optimum irrigation strategies could provide additional profits of 37 150 and 161 ha 1 during dry normal and wet years respectively as compared to applying irrigation in all growth periods the findings from this modeling study are useful for producers in the southern ogallala aquifer region for achieving higher seed cotton yields and improving economic profitability while optimizing the application of limited available irrigation water however suggestions on efficient gsbd irrigation strategies should only be used as a general guide as the effects of irrigation regimes deficits on cotton yield cwp and net return vary with soils crop management practices and weather conditions declaration of competing

10123,declining water levels in the southern ogallala aquifer and associated reduction in irrigation capacities and increasing pumping costs necessitate adoption of deficit limited irrigation practices for sustaining cotton production in the texas high plains thp region the overall goal of this study was to evaluate the response of cotton crop to water stress in different growth stages and suggest efficient growth stage based deficit gsbd irrigation schedules for maximizing yield crop water productivity cwp and economic returns under contrasting weather conditions using the cropgro cotton model five growth stages including seedling emergence germination squaring early bloom flower initiation peak bloom and boll opening late bloom were considered a combination of five irrigation scenarios s1 through s5 with seasonal irrigation amounts of 240 300 360 420 and 480 mm and six irrigation treatments t1 through t5 no irrigation in one of the five growth stages and t6 irrigation applied in all five growth stages were then simulated with a center pivot irrigation system skipping irrigation during the peak bloom growth stage t4 treatment resulted in the lowest yield cwp and net returns under all weather conditions the t1 irrigation treatment in which irrigation was skipped during the seedling emergence germination stage was identified as the most efficient irrigation strategy for maximizing yield cwp and net returns among all irrigation scenarios application of more than 360 420 and 480 mm of irrigation water in wet normal and dry years respectively did not significantly improve yield or net returns and resulted in a decrease in cwp these results imply that cotton responses to water deficit vary by growth stages and adoption of appropriate gsbd irrigation strategies could optimize the use of limited water resources and extend the life of the southern ogallala aquifer graphical abstract ga1 keywords cropgro cotton deficit irrigation dssat irrigation economics ogallala aquifer texas high plains 1 introduction irrigated agriculture in many parts of the world is facing key sustainability issues due to rapidly growing population and declining water availability texas high plains thp is one of such regions where producers are finding it difficult to provide full irrigation to meet crop water needs due to continuously declining water levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer which is the largest aquifer in the united states scanlon et al 2012 availability of groundwater in the southern portion of this aquifer is critical to the economy of the thp region as about 93 of the total water use in this region comes from this aquifer weinheimer et al 2013 o shaughnessy et al 2020 about 95 of the water mined from this highly depleted aquifer is used for irrigated agriculture twdb 2020 as ogallala aquifer is the primary source of irrigation water in this region the effect of groundwater pumping for crop production on the decline of groundwater levels in the aquifer is much severe in dry years especially in the southern portion of the aquifer chaudhuri and ale 2014a scanlon et al 2012 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is the main irrigated crop in the thp region with planted acres of about 52 of the thp s total field crop acreage usda nass 2020 irrigated cotton production in this region is facing challenges as groundwater in the southern ogallala aquifer is depleting at an unsustainable rate due to extraction far exceeding recharge scanlon et al 2012 nair et al 2013 while the average decline in groundwater level across the eight states in the ogallala aquifer region since pre development 1950 was estimated as 4 6 m 15 6 ft it was 12 5 m 41 1 ft in the thp region mcguire 2017 rapid depletion of the ogallala aquifer has not only reduced groundwater availability for irrigation mcmahon et al 2007 chaudhuri and ale 2014a 2014b himanshu et al 2019 but also increased groundwater pumping costs konikow and kendy 2005 colaizzi et al 2009 the groundwater conservation districts within the thp region have imposed limits on groundwater withdrawals to extend the life of the ogallala aquifer for example the annual groundwater pumping limit was set at 457 mm 18 in by the high plains underground water conservation district hpwd 2015 at the same time studies on climate change for the thp region project major changes in summer winter precipitation patterns and an increase in temperature in the future which could further exacerbate the existing water shortages and adversely affect crop production islam et al 2012 modala et al 2017 nielsen gammon et al 2020 production of more food from less water for a growing population is a major challenge for the agriculture sector and this could be achieved by enhancing crop water productivity cwp pabuayon et al 2019 araya et al 2019 an increase in cwp can be achieved either with more production from the same amount of water or the same production with less amount of water which can directly benefit other water users cwp can be improved with regulated deficit irrigation which strategically applies less water than required to achieve maximal yield zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 geerts and raes 2009 hunsaker et al 2015 greaves and wang 2017 shareef et al 2018 the selection of an appropriate irrigation method is also important for achieving higher cwp and this depends on several factors including climate crop and soil type topography water and labor availability energy use and cost of irrigation system due to windy conditions semi arid climate and existing water scarcity problems less efficient surface irrigation methods are not recommended for the thp region subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems are gaining popularity in this region and a carefully managed sdi system probably provides the greatest cwp due to the highest reduction in irrigation water losses however center pivot irrigation is the most commonly used irrigation method in this region and this method also has the potential to provide higher cwp zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 estimated the potential maximum global cwp of cotton as 0 33 kg m 3 however the current global cwp of cotton is 0 23 kg m 3 suggesting enormous opportunities for increasing cotton cwp with an estimated 20 40 reduction in the water use fan et al 2018 the efficiency of water use can be increased through optimal allocation of irrigation water among critical growth stages bordovsky et al 2015 greaves and wang 2017 zonta et al 2017 h li et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 these studies reported a significant reduction in yield when water deficit was imposed during peak bloom stage as compared to the deficit during early and late growth stages the amount and distribution of rainfall also affects cotton growth and yield significantly as water requirement of cotton varies widely during different growth stages fisher and udeigwe 2012 boman and warren 2014 therefore an assessment of the effects of growing season precipitation and irrigation under different growth stage based deficit gsbd irrigation strategies on crop yield cwp and net returns could assist in the identification of strategies for efficient irrigation management economics of irrigated cotton systems in the arid and semi arid regions of the united states were evaluated by several researchers bordovsky et al 2001 delaune et al 2012 mitchell mccallister et al 2020 focusing on the thp region bordovsky et al 2001 compared the profits of cotton production using low energy precision application lepa and sdi systems and reported higher net returns using lepa if the irrigation capacity was greater than 2 5 mm d 1 0 1 in d 1 delaune et al 2012 studied the effects of five irrigation regimes 0 33 66 100 and 133 et replacement on cotton production they found that maximum lint yield and net returns were achieved at 104 5 and 102 et replacement respectively while irrigation at 83 et replacement resulted in the lint yield within the 95 confidence interval mitchell mccallister et al 2020 estimated the profitability of irrigating cotton during three growing periods early vegetative reproductive and maturation based on growing degree day accumulation and found that irrigation during maturation at 6 4 mm d 1 irrigation level increased profits by 468 and 110 as compared to 0 and 3 2 mm d 1 irrigation levels respectively evaluating efficient irrigation strategies through field experiments alone is rather difficult and it is constrained by time and cost crop simulation models on the other hand are useful to evaluate efficient crop and irrigation strategies based on crop yield cwp and net returns for diverse cropping systems adhikari et al 2016 attia et al 2016 gaydon et al 2017 thorp et al 2017 himanshu et al 2019 however before application these models require a thorough evaluation based on observed data several crop growth models have been developed for assessing cotton growth development and yield under varying agro climatic conditions thorp et al 2014 among them the cropgro cotton module of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropping system model csm has been widely adopted across the world for evaluating cotton production under different irrigation management approaches butter et al 2007 pathak et al 2007 modala et al 2015 mauget et al 2017 thorp et al 2017 loison et al 2017 m li et al 2019 garibay et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 ale et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in a recent study we suggested efficient gsbd irrigation strategies for increasing irrigation water use efficiency iwue while achieving higher cotton yield under different climatic conditions using an sdi system himanshu et al 2019 however as mentioned earlier center pivot irrigation systems are more commonly used in this region and sdi systems are used in less than 20 of the irrigated area while the center pivot systems irrigate about 740 000 ha within the hpwd limits sdi systems irrigate only 181 000 ha hpwd 2018 in addition the economic analysis of simulated irrigation strategies was not carried out in himanshu et al 2019 therefore the objectives of this study were to i identify critical cotton growth periods for application of irrigation using center pivot sprinkler irrigation system ii assess the long term 1977 2018 effects of gsbd irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield cwp and economic returns at halfway in the thp region and iii suggest efficient gsbd irrigation strategies for dry normal and wet weather years the csm cropgro cotton model which was previously evaluated for this study area adhikari et al 2016 was used to achieve the above objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the availability of irrigation water from the ogallala aquifer along with favorable growing conditions and fertile soils make thp one of the world s most productive agricultural regions weinheimer et al 2013 thp is also a major cotton growing region and it contributes to about 25 and 64 of the us and texas cotton production respectively mauget et al 2017 usda nass 2020 about 25 different crops are grown in this region with cotton winter wheat triticum aestivum l grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l and corn zea mays l being the primary irrigated crops the local climate is classified as semi arid and windy with large variations in daily temperature hashem et al 2020 the thp region typically receives about 200 300 mm 8 12 in of rainfall during the summer growing season weinheimer et al 2013 clay loams and sandy loams are common soil types in this region measured data from a cotton iwue field experiment conducted by bordovsky et al 2015 during 2010 2013 growing seasons at the texas a m agrilife research center at halfway 34 10 n 101 56 w elevation 1075 m in the thp was used by adhikari et al 2016 for evaluating the dssat cropgro cotton model the treatments in the iwue experiment consisted of three in season irrigation capacities of low l 0 mm d 1 medium m 3 2 mm d 1 and high h 6 4 mm d 1 applied during pre bloom peak bloom and post peak bloom growth stages these three irrigation periods were defined on the basis of accumulated growing degree days gdds at a threshold temperature of 15 6 c 2 2 crop growth simulation model the dssat csm cropgro cotton model version 4 7 was used in this study the model can simulate growth and yield responses of cotton under different crop and management strategies over time jones et al 2003 thorp et al 2014 garibay et al 2019 hoogenboom et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the model requires inputs related to weather genetic parameters soil properties and crop and irrigation management the minimum weather data required for the model include daily precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature and solar radiation dew point temperature relative humidity and wind speed are optional weather inputs required genetic parameters include ecotype cultivar and species coefficients defined in eco cul and spe suffixed files the model inputs related to irrigation management planting and harvesting tillage management fertilizer and chemical applications in this study were decided based on the experimental details provided in bordovsky et al 2015 additional details about the model inputs used in this study can be found in adhikari et al 2016 2 3 weather input data the daily weather data required by the model including precipitation mm maximum and minimum air temperature c wind speed m s 1 relative humidity and solar radiation mj m 2 were obtained for the period from 1977 to 2018 from an on site weather station at halfway the growing season april october and non growing season rainfall and average daily minimum and maximum growing season air temperature varied substantially during the simulation period fig 1 the average 1977 2018 growing season and annual rainfall recorded at the study site were 344 mm and 463 mm respectively the average growing season minimum and maximum temperature recorded at the study site were 12 7 c in the year 1995 and 31 7 c in the year 2011 respectively fig 1 2 4 model evaluation as mentioned earlier the dssat cropgro cotton model used in this study was previously evaluated for the study site by adhikari et al 2016 based on the measured data from bordovsky et al 2015 cotton iwue experiment during four growing seasons from 2010 to 2013 twenty seven irrigation treatments were implemented in the field experiment the model was calibrated using measured data from 4 high irrigation treatments and it was evaluated using measured data from the remaining 23 low and medium irrigation treatments the measured and simulated dates of onset of different phenological stages and seed cotton yields matched well during model calibration and evaluation adhikari et al 2016 an average percent error of 0 1 and 6 5 was estimated for cotton yield prediction during the calibration and evaluation respectively the coefficient of determination r2 in cotton yield prediction was 0 94 during both calibration and evaluation periods complete details about the model evaluation are available in adhikari et al 2016 2 5 simulated irrigation strategies the effects of gsbd irrigation strategies on cotton yield cwp and economic returns were assessed by performing long term simulations over 42 years 1977 2018 based on the four years 2010 2013 of observed records from the field experiment at halfway bordovsky et al 2015 planting and harvesting dates in each year were assumed as may 11 and november 8 respectively similar to himanshu et al 2019 study five growth stages were considered as critical for irrigation in this study i seedling emergence germination stage gs1 spanning from 3 to 17 days after planting dap during which the irrigation requirement is low ii squaring stage gs2 23 47 dap low irrigation requirement iii early bloom flower initiation stage gs3 48 72 dap moderate irrigation requirement iv peak bloom stage gs4 73 102 dap high irrigation requirement v boll opening late bloom stage gs5 103 130 dap moderate irrigation requirement five irrigation scenarios were considered in this study and the amount of irrigation water applied during the cotton growing season in those scenarios was varied from 240 to 480 mm table 1 the irrigation amount per application was kept at 24 mm with a minimum irrigation interval of four days the amount of seasonal irrigation water in each irrigation scenario was distributed among the five growth stages according to the irrigation requirement in respective growth stages fig 2 for example the greatest proportion of irrigation water was applied during the peak bloom stage when irrigation requirement was the highest fig 2 the proportion of irrigation water applied during different crop growth stages under simulated irrigation strategies are presented in fig 2 the irrigation applications within a growth period were evenly distributed on both sides of the center day for example under the first scenario s1 one irrigation was allocated for gs1 stage 3 17 dap and it was simulated on the 10th dap in the case of scenarios s2 to s5 except s2 t6 two irrigations were allocated for gs1 stage and they were applied on 8 and 12 dap irrigation was skipped on days when a significant amount of rainfall was received however the number of irrigation applications enumerated for specific growth stages was maintained by extending the period of irrigation relatively wider windows were therefore considered for all growth stages so that all of the allocated irrigations within a growth period could be simulated even in case of multiple rainy days a seasonal analysis was carried out for the long term 1977 2018 simulations by running each year s simulation independently of the previous year and initializing soil initial conditions prior to planting each year to ensure that there were no residual effects of previous years tovihoudji et al 2019 six irrigation treatments were adopted under each irrigation scenario out of the six treatments irrigation was eliminated in one of the five identified critical growth stages in treatments t1 through t5 and irrigation was applied in all growth stages in the last treatment t6 figs 2 and 3 however within an irrigation scenario the applied irrigation amount was kept the same for all irrigation treatments fig 3 irrigation treatment t6 was used as a control treatment and the effects of different gsbd irrigation strategies t1 through t5 on cotton yield and net gross returns were assessed by comparing these simulated results for respective treatments with those for the t6 treatment based on the amount of rainfall received during the growing period april to october the years in the long term simulation period of 1977 2018 were divided into dry normal and wet years for the analysis of simulated results the years with less than 277 mm 33rd percentile and greater than 366 mm 66th percentile growing season precipitation were considered dry and wet years respectively the remaining years were considered normal years the same thresholds were also chosen by himanshu et al 2019 and kothari et al 2019 for classifying simulation years into different weather variability classes the average growing season rainfall for the dry years 1980 1983 1984 1990 1993 1994 1996 1998 2000 2001 2002 2003 2011 and 2013 normal years 1977 1978 1982 1997 1999 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2012 2016 and 2018 and wet years 1979 1981 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1991 1992 1995 2004 2014 2015 and 2017 was 220 mm 322 mm and 490 mm respectively similarly the average growing season air temperature during dry normal and wet years was determined as 22 0 c 21 4 c and 21 3 c respectively efficient irrigation strategies for cotton production in the thp region under different weather conditions were finally suggested based on the simulated crop yield cwp and economic returns while considering the hpwd s annual groundwater withdrawal limit 457 mm for irrigation an irrigation strategy i e an irrigation treatment under an irrigation scenario was considered as ideal for a weather category if there was no minimal increase in mean cotton yield cwp and net returns from applying next higher irrigation amount 2 6 estimation of net depth of irrigation requirement and crop water productivity the seasonal crop water requirement cwr was estimated as the amount of water needed to meet simulated evapotranspiration requirement during the growth period the seasonal net depth of irrigation requirement nir was then calculated by subtracting seasonal rainfall from cwr based on the amount of irrigation water applied during the growing season 240 300 360 420 and 480 mm for irrigation scenarios s1 through s5 the percentage of nir met through irrigation irm was finally calculated as 1 irm applied seasonal irrigation irrigation efficiency nir 100 the irrigation efficiency of the lepa center pivot irrigation system used at the study site was assumed as 95 cwp is a robust benchmark for assessing crop production in relation to water application edreira et al 2018 cwp can be increased significantly if yields are not penalized by appropriately timed deficit irrigations zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in this study cwp kg m 3 was estimated using the following relationship playán and mateos 2006 pereira et al 2009 2012 2 c wp yield twu where yield refers to the irrigated seed cotton yield kg ha 1 and twu is the total water use which was estimated using the equation below rodrigues and pereira 2009 3 twu p i δ sw cr where p is the seasonal precipitation m3 i is the seasonal irrigation amount m3 δsw is the change in soil water content between planting and harvest m3 and cr is the capillary rise m3 since the groundwater level in the study region is greater than 60 m below the ground surface twbd 2020 the capillary rise was considered negligible in this study 2 7 economic analysis and profit estimation economic analysis was conducted using observed data from the field experiment at halfway during 2010 2013 bordovsky et al 2015 and the simulated yield data from the long term simulations 1977 2018 specifically lint and cotton seed yields were estimated from the simulated seed cotton yields using turnout ratios of 0 362 and 0 502 respectively based on the measured data

discussion 3 1 impacts of simulated gsbd irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield box plots of annual yield distributions and line charts of average annual yields under different gsbd irrigation strategies during dry normal and wet years are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively due to differences in response of cotton to water deficit during different growth stages a considerable variation in yield was found among different gsbd irrigation strategies figs 4 and 5 the changes in seed cotton yield under different irrigation treatments when irrigation was skipped in a growth stage t1 through t5 as compared to t6 same quantity of irrigation water was applied but distributed to all growth stages are presented in table 2 the results show that eliminating irrigation during the initial growth stages t1 and t2 treatments resulted in a significant increase in seed cotton yield except in the case of s5 t2 when there was a slight reduction as compared to t6 when irrigation was applied in all growth stages table 2 the average yield increase among different irrigation scenarios was 18 6 9 0 and 3 7 during dry normal and wet years respectively under t1 treatment when irrigation was skipped during gs1 a similar increase in seed cotton yield of 13 9 6 0 and 2 7 was found during dry normal and wet years respectively under t2 treatment when irrigation was skipped during gs2 irrigation applications in the early growth stages of cotton can be lost via evaporation due to high temperatures in this semi arid region and hence they do not contribute to an increase in yield himanshu et al 2019 those early irrigations also result in diseases and undesirable excessive plant growth skipping irrigation in gs1 and gs2 stages potentially increased root growth and therefore water uptake and enhanced resilience of cotton to shortage of water all of these factors contributed to an increase in yield thorp et al 2017 no irrigation during the peak bloom growth stage t4 treatment resulted in the lowest seed cotton yield under all irrigation scenarios in dry normal and wet years figs 4 and 5 the yield reduction under t4 treatment was 59 3 43 3 and 17 0 during dry normal and wet years respectively when compared to t6 table 2 in general water deficit during peak bloom growth stage reduces flowering rate and boll retention and increases shedding zonta et al 2017 most reproductive structures grow and develop during this critical stage and therefore plants require more water ritchie et al 2007 numerous studies perry and barnes 2012 bordovsky et al 2015 himanshu et al 2019 have also outlined that imposing water deficit during peak bloom stage affected physiological processes and reduced crop yields significantly however as expected the effect of elimination of irrigation during the peak bloom stage on seed cotton yield was less in wet years than in dry and normal years likewise this effect was minimal under higher irrigation scenarios especially during wet years application of irrigation water in all growth stages t6 was found beneficial only in the case of s5 irrigation scenario 480 mm as indicated by higher median seed cotton yield in case of t6 treatment compared to other treatments especially during dry years fig 4 in the cases of higher irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 elimination of irrigation during gs1 to gs3 and gs5 growth stages did not significantly affect yield due to availability of enough moisture from irrigation in preceding growth stages however providing excess water in any growth stage could create excess water stress resulting in a yield loss simulated cotton yield in wet years was as expected consistently higher than that in dry and normal years fig 4 additionally in the case of wet years maximum yield was achieved with a lesser irrigation amount as compared to dry and normal years with the increase in irrigation water applied the simulated seed cotton yield increased continuously in dry years in the case of normal and wet years the simulated yield increased gradually with an increase in irrigation water application and peaked at 420 mm scenario 4 and 360 mm scenario 5 respectively and any additional irrigation resulted in no minor increase in yield fig 5 also the differences in simulated seed cotton yield among different categories of years were found to be minimum in the case of high irrigation scenarios s4 through s5 figs 4 and 5 these results indicate that the producers in the thp have the potential of achieving higher cotton yields while complying with the hpwd s annual pumping allowance 457 mm by adopting appropriate gsbd irrigation strategies especially during normal and wet years 3 2 impacts of gsbd irrigation strategies on seasonal net depth of irrigation requirement and crop water productivity the simulated seasonal cwr nir and irm under different irrigation strategies in dry normal and wet years are presented in table 3 interestingly cwr was consistently higher in wet years than in dry and normal years under all irrigation strategies as expected nir was consistently lower in wet years than in dry and normal years as the majority of cwr in wet years was met from rainfall however the irm was found to be maximum in wet years followed by normal and dry years table 3 in wet years the irm exceeded 100 when applied seasonal irrigation water was 360 mm or higher the cwr nir and irm values increased continuously from irrigation strategies s1 to s5 under different weather conditions simulated annual cwp distributions and average annual cwp under different gsbd irrigation strategies during dry normal and wet years are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively similar to yield trends a considerable difference in cwp was found among simulated irrigation strategies due to the differences in the response of cotton crop to availability of water during different growth stages snowden et al 2014 zonta et al 2017 specifically cwp was found to be the lowest in all irrigation scenarios in which irrigation was skipped during the peak bloom stage gs4 figs 6 and 7 in contrast elimination of irrigation during the initial growth stages gs1 and gs2 improved cwp when compared to applying irrigation water in all growth stages t6 treatment fig 7 the cwp increased continuously with the increase in irrigation water applied in the case of dry years in normal and wet years the cwp increased steadily until the irrigation amount reached 360 mm s3 scenario and a further increase in irrigation resulted in a slight reduction in cwp fig 7 in addition variability in the simulated cwp decreased with an increase in irrigation amount under all weather conditions and this variability was minimum in wet years this was because the benefit of irrigation water became less prominent with higher growing season precipitation received in wet years the simulated cwp was found to be consistently lower under dry weather conditions in the case of low and moderate irrigation scenarios s1 through s3 fig 7 conversely under high irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 the simulated cwp was higher in dry years except in the case of t4 treatment followed by normal years fig 7 these results indicate that higher amounts of irrigation water would be needed to improve cwp during dry years in normal and wet years however application of moderate amounts of irrigation water s3 scenario would be desirable for increasing cwp while maintaining high seed cotton yields 3 3 profitability under simulated gsbd irrigation strategies gross return production cost and net return under the simulated gsbd irrigation strategies among three weather categories are presented in fig 8 the results indicated that application of appropriate gsbd irrigation strategies could potentially improve the profitability of irrigated cotton production in the thp region depending on current practices and irrigation water availability the trends in gross return and production costs under simulated strategies were similar to those of yields in dry normal and wet years fig 8a b both gross return and production cost increased linearly in dry years with the increase in irrigation water applied in normal years the rate of increase in gross return and production cost decreased with the increase in irrigation water applied especially for t1 and t2 irrigation treatments in wet years the gross return and production cost increased gradually until the amount of irrigation water increased to 360 mm scenario s3 and thereafter the rate of increase slowed down eliminating irrigation in the peak bloom growth stage resulted in the lowest gross return and production cost in all weather conditions because low cotton yield in this treatment lowered harvesting hauling and ginning expenses and reduced income from the sale of lint and cotton seed fig 8a b the impacts of gsbd irrigation strategies on gross return and production cost were minimal under higher irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 specifically in wet years as compared to dry and normal weather conditions the gross returns and production costs were found consistently higher under wet weather conditions especially in low and medium irrigation scenarios s1 through s3 however variations in gross returns and production costs under different weather conditions were found to be small in the case of high irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 the net returns from cotton production under different gsbd irrigation strategies are shown in fig 8c the economic impact of skipping irrigation in a particular growth stage t1 through t5 in comparison to t6 i e irrigation water applied in all growth stages is presented in table 4 a significant income loss was observed when irrigation was eliminated during gs4 irrigation treatment t4 under all irrigation scenarios and categories of years table 4 on average a loss of 997 775 and 462 ha 1 was estimated during dry normal and wet years respectively for the t4 treatment when compared to their counterpart t6 treatment several other studies also reported similar results and concluded that imposing water deficit during peak bloom growth stage had a significant negative effect on crop development and yield bordovsky et al 2015 zonta et al 2017 himanshu et al 2019 on the other hand eliminating irrigation during initial growth stages gs1 to gs2 resulted in a greater net return compared to the t6 treatment in which irrigation was applied in all growth stages table 4 on average a net profit of 278 179 and 98 ha 1 was estimated during dry normal and wet years respectively for the t1 treatment a slightly lower average net profit of 211 162 and 72 ha 1 was estimated during dry normal and wet years respectively for the t2 treatment compared to the t6 treatment these results are consistent with some recent studies bordovsky et al 2015 mitchell mccallister et al 2020 which showed that imposing water stress during early growth stages could potentially increase cotton root growth and resilience to water uptake during water shortage periods and thereby increase seed cotton yield and net return the net return was found to be consistently higher under wet weather conditions especially in low and medium irrigation scenarios s1 through s3 fig 8c in the case of high irrigation scenarios s4 and s5 variation in net returns among dry normal and wet years was found to be minimum like seed cotton yield the net return in dry years increased linearly with the increase in the amount of irrigation water applied in normal and wet years the net returns increased steadily until the irrigation amount was increased to 420 mm scenario s4 and 360 mm scenario s3 respectively and application of additional irrigation resulted in a minor increase in net returns especially with better performing irrigation treatments t1 and t2 fig 8 overall the irrigation treatment t1 skipping irrigation in the first growth stage was found to be the best irrigation strategy for maximizing net return followed by t2 therefore the differences in net returns across the treatments became smaller as seasonal precipitation increased from dry years to wet years and the effect of different irrigation strategies on net returns became minimal as more irrigation water was applied from s1 to s5 3 4 suggested efficient gsbd irrigation strategies for different weather conditions the ideal irrigation strategies identified for dry normal and wet years based on simulated seed cotton yields cwps and net returns are summarized in table 5 irrigation treatment t1 was identified as the best irrigation strategy for maximizing yield cwp and net return under all weather conditions fig 9 irrigation amount applied under the identified ideal irrigation strategies for normal s4 t1 and wet s3 t1 years was found to be less than the hpwd s annual groundwater pumping limit 457 mm indicating that irrigating cotton as per the suggested gsbd irrigation strategies could enable producers maximize their net returns while complying with the hpwd pumping restrictions however in the case of dry years seasonal irrigation water applied under the suggested efficient irrigation strategy s5 t1 was found to be 480 mm indicating that the potential highest yield might not be achieved in dry years without surpassing the hpwd s annual pumping allowance however with careful planning producers can save irrigation water in normal wet years and bank it for use in succeeding dry years overall application of 360 mm scenario s3 420 mm scenario s4 and 480 mm scenario s5 of irrigation water during growth stages gs2 to gs5 as per the treatment t1 in wet normal and dry years respectively could maximize seed cotton yield cwp and net returns these results indicate that the recommended optimum irrigation strategies could increase seed cotton yield by 1 6 3 9 and 5 4 during dry normal and wet years respectively as compared to treatment t6 irrigation applied in all growth stages in addition suggested irrigation strategies could provide additional profits of 37 150 and 161 ha 1 during dry normal and wet years respectively therefore the adoption of appropriate gsbd irrigation strategies based on forecasted weather conditions could save irrigation water especially during normal and wet years however as a growing season progresses changes in actual weather conditions may necessitate switching from one strategy to another for achieving optimum yield and water productivity 4 conclusions the effects of gsbd irrigation strategies on seed cotton yield cwp and economic returns were assessed and efficient irrigation strategies for cotton production under dry normal and wet weather conditions were suggested for the thp region using the dssat csm cropgro cotton model the response of cotton crop to water deficit varied substantially among growth stages and the net returns were greatly affected by the amount and distribution of irrigation water applied in different growth stages eliminating irrigation during initial growth stages gs1 to gs2 resulted in an improvement in seed cotton yield cwp and net return in contrast eliminating irrigation during the peak bloom stage gs4 resulted in the lowest yield cwp and net return net return was found to be consistently higher for wet years when compared to dry and normal years especially under low and medium irrigation strategies s1 through s3 however in the case of high irrigation strategies s4 and s5 variation in net return under different weather conditions was found to be minimum with higher precipitation the advantage of irrigation water became less prominent the irrigation treatment t1 was identified as the best gsbd irrigation treatment for maximizing the net return from irrigated cotton production overall application of 360 mm scenario s3 420 mm scenario s4 and 480 mm scenario s5 of irrigation water as per the irrigation treatment t1 in wet normal and dry years respectively was recommended to maximize seed cotton yield cwp and net return this study revealed that the recommended optimum irrigation strategies could provide additional profits of 37 150 and 161 ha 1 during dry normal and wet years respectively as compared to applying irrigation in all growth periods the findings from this modeling study are useful for producers in the southern ogallala aquifer region for achieving higher seed cotton yields and improving economic profitability while optimizing the application of limited available irrigation water however suggestions on efficient gsbd irrigation strategies should only be used as a general guide as the effects of irrigation regimes deficits on cotton yield cwp and net return vary with soils crop management practices and weather conditions declaration of competing

10124,drip irrigation using fertilizers is one of the commonly used methods to save fertilizer and minimize the impacts of fertilizer on the soil and the environment however the clogging issue of drip fertigation systems has been the major limitation and may lead to system damage if fertilizer solution concentrations are not appropriately selected therefore the head loss flow rates and clogging substances of screen and disc filters were analyzed to evaluate the effect of different fertilizer solution concentrations on filter clogging under different injection rates 2 3 and 4 and fertilizer water ratios 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 in drip fertigation systems the surface morphology and chemical composition of the clogging substances were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry eds the results showed that the large injection rate caused uneven fertilization and the recommend injection rates of the proportional fertilizer pump were 2 and 3 in the same fertilizer solution concentration range the difference in head loss of the screen filter 0 09 7 75 m was larger than that of the disc filter 0 32 3 88 m indicating that the anti clogging performance of the disc filter was better meanwhile the application scope of the fertilizer solution concentration of the screen filter was less than 0 117 and that of the disc filter was between 0 117 and 0 296 there was a significant effect of the fertilizer solution concentrations on filter clogging p 0 05 the interaction between the fertilizer solution concentrations and filter types had a more significant effect on filter clogging p 0 01 the clogging substances consisted of undissolved phosphate fertilizers and silicates as well as carbonate and phosphate precipitations generated by chemical reactions the clogging mechanism was a physical and chemical coupling process when using phosphate fertilizers therefore the use of fertilizers especially phosphate fertilizers contributed to the generation of clogging substances fertilizer solution concentrations and type of fertilizers should therefore be considered in the anti clogging performance of filters in drip fertigation systems keywords drip irrigation hydraulic performance clogging substances electron microscopy energy dispersive analysis 1 introduction drip irrigation systems can be used for fertilization which can reduce fertilizer use increase crop yield and minimize the impact of fertilizer on the environment hernandez et al 1991 hanson et al 2006 ajdary et al 2007 li et al 2016 jayakumar et al 2017 therefore drip fertigation is an efficient and precise fertilization method however the use of fertilizer contributes to the formation and development of clogging substances in the drip fertigation systems and excessive fertilizer solution concentration aggravate the clogging process liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 reduce the service life of the system and cause uneven fertilization eventually resulting in a decrease in economic benefits meanwhile drip fertigation is a commonly used method in arid and semi arid regions for water and fertilizer saving consequently research on the anti clogging performance of drip fertigation systems has practical significance for the widely use of the system to enhance the anti clogging performance of drip fertigation systems it is necessary for the used equipment to have efficient performance filters are the key equipment to prevent impurities in drip irrigation systems oron et al 1979 mcdonald et al 1984 tripathi et al 2014 and their good hydraulic performance can ensure the efficient operation of the systems wu et al 2015 found that the filtration efficiency of sand filters was 11 4 48 0 which increased when used with disc filters many scholars have studied filter hydraulic parameters to evaluate the anti clogging performance of different filters duran ros et al 2009 concluded that the flow rate of emitters protected by disc filters had the smallest change when compared with other filters ribeiro et al 2008 showed that the head loss changes in disc filters were more significant than those in non woven synthetic fabric filters zong et al 2012 studied the relationship between the filter head loss and flow rate when using muddy water and thought that the head loss was a key parameter to evaluate filter performance fertilizer solution concentration is another key factor that affects the clogging of drip fertigation systems various ions and impurities in fertilizer solutions react with the ions in water to form insoluble precipitates thereby increasing the clogging degree of the drip fertigation system haynes 1985 li et al 2007 tang et al 2018 stated that the fertilizer solution concentration was one of the factors affecting fertilization uniformity and poor fertilization uniformity can lead to the clogging of drip irrigation systems li et al 2015 inferred that the clogging effect of emitters was more obvious at higher fertilizer concentrations phosphorus is an essential nutrient for the growth of crops yamaji et al 2017 however the excessive use of phosphate fertilizer can easily cause water and soil pollution therefore it is best to use drip irrigation systems to effectively use phosphate fertilizer studies have shown that phosphate fertilizer aggravate the clogging of drip irrigation systems but the clogging risk of drip fertigation systems can be reduced by setting appropriate system operation patterns zhou et al 2015 tang et al 2018 the anti clogging performance of drip fertigation systems can be improved when fertilizer solution concentrations are matched with the performance of the filtration systems research on the anti clogging performance of drip irrigation systems has focused on the independent performance of each device and emitter clogging pei et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 feng et al 2017 studies on the filter anti clogging performance are mostly based on the impurities in the water source without considering the effect of fertilizers therefore the fertilization process filtration performance and clogging substances of filters in drip fertigation systems need further study the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the uniformity of the fertilizer solution concentration under different combinations of injection rates and fertilizer water ratios in drip fertigation systems 2 explore the effects of different fertilizer solution concentrations on the hydraulic performance of filters and the clogging substances of screen and disc filters the results of this study will provide a reference for the anti clogging research aiming to promote the integrated water and fertilizer technology of drip fertigation systems in arid and semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment designs the drip fertigation experiments were carried out in the shiyang river ecological water saving experimental station in gansu province from april to october of 2017 with a pre experiment and field experiment respectively the shiyang river station is located on the edge of the tengger desert which is a typical drought deficient area with an average elevation of 1581 m and drought index of 5 25 the annual average rainfall and evaporation of the station is 160 mm and 2000 mm respectively additionally the water source in the station is the shiyang river water system and three water samples were collected before the experiment table 1 presents the chemical parameters of the shiyang river water from table 1 it can be observed that the concentration of ca2 is highest in the cations and the concentrations of hco3 and so4 2 are relatively higher in the anions the ph value of water is slightly alkaline the layout of the pre experiment and field experiment is shown in fig 1 including a proportional fertilizer pump water meters with an accuracy of 2 pressure gauges valves screen filters disc filters and driplines the design flow rates of the proportional fertilizer pump range from 20 to 2 500 l h and the setting injection rate range from 1 to 4 the screen and disc filters jie yang lu mei water saving technology co ltd have an inlet diameter of 32 mm aperture 125 µm and design flow rate of 0 5 4 5 m3 h the screen of the screen filter was made of iron and the core of the disc filter was made of plastic the effective water passing area of filter is the area of the filter screen or core through which water can pass knowing the aperture size of the filter screen core the effective water passing area can be calculated the precision digital pressure gauge with an accuracy of 0 25 has a measuring range of 0 0 25 mpa y180 hangzhou mico sensor technology co ltd two types of non pressure compensating emitters were used the flat emitter rated discharge 2 03 l h emitter spacing 0 3 m and the flank labyrinth emitter 1 98 l h emitter spacing 0 15 m three kinds of fertilizers urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate were studied in the pre experiment of the drip fertigation system it was found that urea and potassium sulfate fertilizer had better solubility than the phosphate fertilizer the clogging of the drip fertigation system was induced by diammonium phosphate therefore diammonium phosphate p2o5 46 which is commonly used in the field was selected as the experimental fertilizer during the actual operation of the drip fertigation system various impurities inevitably appeared in the water source the most common ones included sand and clay particles in the soil table 2 shows the elemental content of phosphate fertilizer and soil by energy spectrum analysis the treatments were carried out at three injection rates of 2 3 4 and each treatment contained three fertilizer water ratios of 1 4 mass ratio of fertilizer to water 1 5 and 1 6 in the pre experiment table 3 meanwhile the drip fertigation system was built with a screen filter disc filter and no filter on the three parallel driplines fig 1 creating a total of 27 treatments each treatment was repeated three times the injection rate in the experimental setup was determined by the proportional fertilizer pump the purpose of setting different fertilizer water ratios was to explore the influence of diammonium phosphate solubility on filter clogging three parts of 0 87 kg of diammonium phosphate were weighed and dissolved in 3 48 kg 4 35 kg and 5 22 kg of water to obtain fertilizer water ratios of 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 the 0 87 kg fertilizer was determined by the actual fertilizer demand in the field when making the fertilizer solution the phosphate fertilizer was added to the water stirred thoroughly soaked in water for one hour then stirred again to fully dissolve it it was found that the fertilizer could not be completely dissolved and there was still a gray green powdery precipitate at the bottom of the fertilizer solution which was turbid after stirring 2 2 field experiments the field experiment was set up in a maize field with an area of 0 25 ha aiming to verify the fertilization uniformity of the fertilizer pump and further evaluate the hydraulic characteristics and anti clogging performance of the filters in practical applications xianyu 335 maize was sown on may 6 2017 and the planting method was one film one dripline and two rows of mulch with a film width of 0 12 m corn plant spacing of 0 25 m and row spacing of 0 4 m the test area was divided into eight plots arranged in four rows and two columns every four plots used the same emitters in each of the four plots three plots were treated with different fertilization treatments 2 3 4 the other was treated with fresh water as a control each plot 50 3 6 m was laid with three 50 m long driplines of the same emitter type and the three driplines were installed with a screen filter disc filter and no filter respectively the drip fertigation system layout of each plot is shown in fig 1 before planting 30 urea n 200 kg ha and all the potassium sulfate k2o 90 kg ha were applied as the base fertilizer and full irrigation was done during the entire growth period the harvest date was on september 24 a total of nine fertigations were carried out from june 6th to september 9th the diammonium phosphate p2o5 200 kg ha used was averaged into nine fertigations and 0 87 kg of diammonium phosphate was applied to each plot each time the irrigation process involved two periods namely the fertigation period and the water irrigation period first fertigation was carried out with fertilizer and water and the duration of the fertigation was 20 25 min subsequently fresh water was used for about one hour the alternate irrigation method of fertilizer solution and fresh water can effectively reduce the clogging probability of drip fertigation systems the reason for the inconsistent fertigation time was that the volume of the fertilizer solution with different fertilizer water ratios was different the head loss flow rate of the filters and fertilizer solution concentrations were measured during the fertigation period the head loss was converted from differential pressure within 1 min which was measured by pressure gauges installed at both ends of the filter the flow rate was read once every 3 min from the water meter installed behind the filter a fertilizer solution sample was taken once every 3 min at the water intake fig 1 the collected fertilizer solution sample was measured using a conductivity meter dds 11a shanghai magnetic resonance and its concentration was converted from conductivities using a concentration conversion formula phene et al 1992 machado and oliveira 2005 the screen or core are both inside the filters and they were removed from the screen disc filter and placed in the shade of ventilation to dry after the experiment then the clogging substances were scraped off and observed using a scanning electron microscope and the surface energy spectrum analysis was performed to analyze the clogging substance 2 3 uniformity indexes fertilization uniformity is one of the indexes used to assess the performance of the fertilization pump in drip fertigation systems fan et al 2016 zhou et al 2009 if the fertilization uniformity is too low the yield of crops and efficiency of fertilizer use will decrease therefore the evaluation of fertilization uniformity is essential for drip fertigation systems in the filtration system the effect of the uniformity of the fertilizer solution concentration on the performance of the filter should be verified further in this experiment three fertilization uniformity indexes were used as follows 1 the christiansen coefficient calculated in formula one christiansen 1942 1 u c 100 1 i 1 n x i x n x where u c the christiansen coefficient x the total mean of the sample x i the i th observed value n the total number of observations 2 the distribution uniformity calculated in formula two kruse 1978 where 2 du 100 x lq x du the distribution uniformity x lq the mean of the smaller quarter observations in the sample 3 the statistical uniformity calculated in formula three kruse 1978 3 c v s x x 4 s x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i 2 n 1 n i 1 n x i 2 1 2 5 u s 10 1 c v where c v is the coefficient of variation s x is the standard deviation of the observed values and u s is the statistical uniformity 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analysis of variance was performed using the microsoft excel and spss the significance was identified by the level of p p 0 05 and p 0 01 represent significant and extremely significant effects respectively 3 results 3 1 uniformity of fertilizer solution concentrations the changes of fertilizer solution concentration at the outlet of the proportional fertilizer pump using different injection rates 4 3 2 and fertilizer water ratios 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 are shown in fig 2 the fertilizer solution concentrations remained stable during the operation of the drip fertigation systems indicating that the proportional fertilizer pump had efficient running performance the christiansen coefficient distribution uniformity and statistical uniformity of the fertilizer solution concentrations are shown in table 3 as presented in table 3 there was a significant difference between the nine groups of fertilizer solution concentrations p 0 05 when the injection rate was 4 the christiansen coefficient with 1 6 fertilizer ratio was the smallest and the differences in the christiansen coefficient were significant between the 1 6 fertilizer water ratio and the other treatments p 0 05 similar to the distribution and statistical uniformity however the differences in the christiansen coefficient were not significant when the injection rates were 2 p 0 05 and 3 p 0 05 similar to the statistical and distribution uniformities respectively in general the christiansen distribution and statistical uniformity of the fertilizer solution was better when the injection rates were 2 or 3 however the three uniformity indices of the fertilizer solution was significantly different only when the injection rate was 4 especially when the fertilizer water ratio was 1 6 3 2 filter head loss and flow rate 3 2 1 head loss of screen and disc filters head loss is a key parameter for filter performance elbana et al 2013 an increase in head loss means an increase in filter clogging degree it can be observed from fig 3 that the head loss gradually increased with the increase in fertilizer solution concentrations fig 3 a shows the variation in the head loss of the screen filters for nine groups of fertilizer solution concentrations the inflexion point of the head loss appeared at approximately 3 min then basically remained stable as shown in fig 3 a when the fertilizer solution concentration was less than 0 117 injection rate of 2 with all fertilizer water ratios injection rate of 3 with the fertilizer water ratios of 1 5 and 1 6 the head loss of the screen filter was always less than 0 5 m when the fertilizer solution concentration was more than or equal to 0 117 injection rate of 4 with all fertilizer water ratios the injection rate of 3 with a fertilizer water ratio of 1 4 the variation in head loss was significant fig 3 b shows the variation in head loss of the disc filters which exhibited a slow increasing trend with time indicating that the clogging of the disc filters was a slow accumulation process table 4 shows the total head loss and total flow rate of the filters under different fertilizer solution concentrations the head loss varied significantly when clogging started in the filter it can be observed that the head loss of the disc filters was smaller than that of the screen filters when the fertilizer solution concentration exceeded 0 117 the above results showed that the clogging degree of the disc filters was smaller and the anti clogging performance was better when the fertilizer solution concentrations were between 0 117 0 296 3 2 2 flow rate of screen and disc filters the decrease in flow rates indicates an increase in filter clogging therefore the analysis of the screen and disc filter flow rates is critical for evaluating the anti clogging performance of filters fig 4 shows the relationship between the flow rates and fertilizer solution concentrations under the conditions with filters and without filter the flow rate of the screen filter was reduced from 0 4 m3 h to approximately 0 2 m3 h with an increase in fertilizer solution concentration which was a reduction of 50 compared with the screen filter the flow rate of the disc filter was reduced from 0 4 m3 h to approximately 0 3 m3 h with an increase in fertilizer solution concentration which was a reduction of 25 from the slope of the three lines in fig 4 it can be observed that the flow rate of the screen filter dropped the fastest and most indicating that the anti clogging performance of the disc filters was better 3 3 filter clogging substances clogging that occurs in the filter screen core can be physical chemical or biological bounoua et al 2016 the clogging substances in the filter screen core were observed using a scanning electron microscope meanwhile the energy spectrum analysis was performed to further clarify the clogging substances in the filters the representative particle structure was selected for observation and analysis as shown in figs 5 and 6 where wt is the mass fraction and at is the atomic percentage in fig 5 a the clogging substance was an irregular blocky particle with a honeycomb the energy spectrum analysis is shown in fig 6 compared with the phosphate fertilizer the mass fractions of c o and p in the clogging substances decreased by approximately 29 10 and 15 respectively however the mass fraction of fe had an extremely high content of 65 neither the water source nor the phosphate fertilizer can contain such a large amount of fe therefore it was inferred that the substances originated from the filter screen in fig 5 b the clogging substance was rod shaped the surface was smooth and the remaining impurities were attached the mass fractions of c and p decreased by 20 and 18 respectively but the mass fraction of o increased by 10 compared with that of the phosphate fertilizer the mass fraction of calcium was more than 24 in clogging substances from the atomic percentage of the element it was found that the atomic percentage of ca c o was 1 1 4 4 5 which was close to the caco3 atomic percentage of 1 1 3 indicating that the substances might be caco3 in fig 5 c the clogging substance was a flocculent polymer with an uneven surface the energy spectrum analysis showed that the mass fraction of the metal elements mg al ca and fe increased compared to that of the phosphate fertilizer but the mass fraction of c decreased by approximately 12 the mass fraction of p was up to 19 which was consistent with the content of p in the phosphate fertilizer therefore the clogging substance was a phosphate fertilizer particle simultaneously the atomic percentage of phosphorus to oxygen was 1 4 which can form po4 3 because shiyang river water contains a large amount of ca2 it was speculated that the po4 3 and ca2 would form insoluble precipitate substances in fig 5 d the clogging substance was blocky and irregular in shape according to the energy spectrum analysis the mass fraction of element c increased by approximately 15 compared with that of the soil and the content of si was high therefore this substance was the silicon component in the soil that entered the filtration system 4 discussion fertilization and filtration equipment are critical for avoiding emitter clogging when water and fertilizer integrated technology is applied in drip fertigation systems filtration can be used to reduce system clogging from the source of the drip fertigation systems reduce the risk of emitter clogging and achieve the large scale application of drip fertigation systems additionally the fertilizer solution concentrations and clogging substances in drip fertigation systems can affect the high efficiency and normal operation of the systems tang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to analyze the mutual performance of fertilization and filtration equipment aiming to minimize the probability of clogging in drip fertigation systems 4 1 fertilizer solution concentrations an appropriate fertilizer solution concentration can effectively improve the anti clogging performance of the filters to minimize the clogging degree caused by fertilizers this study analyzed the uniformity of the fertilizer solution concentration under different injection rates and fertilizer water ratios our study found that the fertilization uniformity of the proportional fertilizer pump was good when the injection rates were 2 and 3 however the large injection rate led to uneven fertilization resulting in poor use of the proportional fertilizer pump our study was consistent with the results of tang 2018 he inferred that the uniformity of fertilizers in fertilization equipment was worse with the increase in fertilizer solution concentration and the fertilization uniformity was lower than the irrigation uniformity in drip fertigation systems fan et al 2016 regarding fertilizer solution concentrations our results showed that the fertilizer solution concentration should be less than 0 117 when using a screen filter the disc filter was more suitable for fertilizer concentrations between 0 117 and 0 296 from the perspective of hydraulics the calculation formula for the head loss is h j ζ v 2 2 g v is the flow velocity g is gravity acceleration and ζ is the local head loss coefficient when the fertilizer solution concentration was between 0 117 and 0 296 h j d i s c h j s c r e e n but v d i s c v s c r e e n therefore ζ d i s c ζ s c r e e n the smaller local head loss coefficient ζ indicates a smaller clogging degree of filters the local head loss coefficient ζ of the disc filters was less than that of the screen filters liu et al 2017 deduced that when using a screen filter the emitter was easily clogged when the phosphate fertilizer concentration was between 0 5 and 2 0 the reasons for the differences between the two experiments were the different fertilization equipment used during the operation of the drip fertigation system a reasonable concentration of fertilizer solution should be selected to improve the uniformity of fertigation and avoid short term and efficient clogging 4 2 filter head loss and flow rates the anti clogging performance of the filters was evaluated by analyzing the head loss and flow rate of the filters the smaller the head loss is the better the anti clogging performance of the filters the analysis of the filter head loss showed that the increase in fertilizer solution concentration had a significant effect on the head loss but the significant difference in fertilizer solution concentrations did not mean that the difference between the filter head loss was significant the difference in the head loss of the screen filters 0 09 7 75 m was larger than that of the disc filters 0 32 3 88 m table 4 in the same fertilizer concentration range the flow rate of the disc filters decreased more slowly than that of the screen filters being better than the anti clogging performance of the screen filters the reason for the different head loss is that the effective water area 1600π of the disc filters is 35 times that 46π of the screen filters the filter core in the disc filter contained 100 laminates the grooves in the laminates were used to intercept the clogging substance when water passed through the laminates an analysis of variance was carried out to study the influence of the fertilizer solution concentrations filter types and their interaction on the head loss and flow rate the results are shown in tables 5 and 6 the fertilizer solution concentration had a significant effect on the filter head loss and flow rate p 0 05 and the interaction between fertilizer solution concentrations and filters had an extremely significant effect on the head loss p 0 01 it can be seen from fig 3 that the head loss increased with the increase of the fertilizer solution concentration when using the same filter indicating that the increase of fertilizer solution concentration can cause the increase of head loss and the fertilizer solution concentration had a significant impact on head loss when the fertilizer solution concentration was the same the head loss of the two filters increased with time but the growth rate was different the interaction between fertilizer solution concentration and filter type ultimately resulted in a significant difference in total head loss table 4 from fig 4 the flow rates decreased with the increase of fertilizer solution concentrations when using the same filter indicating that fertilizer solution concentrations have a significant influence on flow rates the fertilizer solution concentration interacted with the filter type which ultimately resulted in a decrease in total flow rate table 4 figs 3 and 4 show the changing process of filter clogging 4 3 filter clogging substances the clogging process of this experiment was a coupling process of physical and chemical clogging the main factors that affected the clogging process of the filters in the experiments were the water quality the soil fertilizer that entered the drip fertigation system and the reaction among them through analysis it was found that the clogging substances were not only undissolved phosphate fertilizers and silicates but also carbonate and phosphate precipitation generated by chemical reactions because of the high concentration of ca2 in the water source the higher content of the generated precipitate was caco3 the phosphorus in the filters was mainly undissolved phosphate fertilizer particles and some phosphate precipitation various ions carbonates and minerals in the water react to form precipitates and adhere to the inside of the filters although many studies have been conducted on emitter clogging in drip irrigation systems few studies have focused on the composition of the clogging substances in filters because filters and emitters are installed in series in drip irrigation systems the composition of the clogging substance in emitters can be used to verify the validity of the experiment results the combination of fertilizers and carbonate precipitates had been the main cause of clogging inducing a higher risk of clogging in drip fertigation systems sagi 1990 haynes et al 1985 deduced that phosphate fertilizer could form insoluble precipitates with ca2 and mg2 liu et al 2017 suggested that phosphate fertilizer produced cahpo4 as clogging substances aggravating the clogging of drip fertigation systems our study considered that phosphate produced some insoluble phosphate precipitations which was consistent with previous results phosphate fertilizer accelerated the flocculation of impurities and ion replacement resulting in the formation of flocs and precipitated particles li et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 li et al 2019 inferred that the precipitation of solid particles caco3 and mgco3 directly affected the clogging process of the drip fertigation system which was consistent with the results of our study li et al 2015 reported that fertilizer only aggravated the flocculation of sediments when using muddy water and ca2 and mg2 were not the main cause of clogging actually different irrigation water qualities can produce similar clogging substances such as quartz calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate and silicate however the clogging risk and induction mechanism were different depending on the type of ions in water hao et al 2017 the clogging of the drip fertigation system caused by phosphate fertilizer was because of the presence of solid particles and the reaction between the fertilizer and water the clogging mechanism induced by phosphate fertilizers in our study was mainly physical and chemical coupling some meaningful results were obtained in the experiment however there are still some issues that should be studied in future 1 although the head loss flow rates and clogging substances of filters in the drip fertigation system were analyzed the other part of the drip irrigation system was not evaluated for example the operation of the emitters under fertilizer water integration conditions needs further study 2 in the analysis of the clogging substances physical and chemical clogging were involved in the use of the phosphate fertilizer however the effect of biological clogging on the filters was not studied further research on biological clogging in drip fertigation systems should be carried out 5 conclusion studying the uniformity of fertilization and the effect of different fertilizer solution concentrations on filter clogging are the basis for the use of drip fertigation systems in the field application this study used scanning electron microscopy and eds to evaluate clogging substances with the aim of studying the formation mechanism of clogging in drip fertigation systems and ease system clogging that may induce system failure in the drip fertigation system the proper injection rate can improve fertilization uniformity and the recommend injection rates of the proportional fertilizer pump were 2 and 3 the difference in head loss of the screen filter 0 09 7 75 m was larger than that of the disc filter 0 32 3 88 m in the same fertilizer concentration range therefore the anti clogging performance of the disc filter was better when using in the long term operation in the drip fertigation system the appropriate fertilizer solution concentration in the screen filter and the disc filter were 0 117 and 0 117 0 296 respectively compared with the filter types the fertilizer solution concentration had a significant impact on the head loss and the flow rate of filters p 0 05 indicating that the fertilizer solution concentration had a significant impact on filter clogging the interaction between the fertilizer solution concentration and filter types had an extremely significant effect on the head loss p 0 01 hence the proper coordination of fertilization equipment and filters can improve the anti clogging performance of drip fertigation systems the reason for drip fertigation clogging caused by the phosphate fertilizer was the existence of solid particles and precipitations from the reaction of fertilizers and water the clogging substance included undissolved phosphate fertilizer silicate as well as carbonate precipitates and phosphate precipitation from chemical reactions the clogging mechanism was a physical and chemical coupling process when using the phosphate fertilizer chemical clogging was a critical factor that caused filter clogging and can not be ignored in the study of

10124,drip irrigation using fertilizers is one of the commonly used methods to save fertilizer and minimize the impacts of fertilizer on the soil and the environment however the clogging issue of drip fertigation systems has been the major limitation and may lead to system damage if fertilizer solution concentrations are not appropriately selected therefore the head loss flow rates and clogging substances of screen and disc filters were analyzed to evaluate the effect of different fertilizer solution concentrations on filter clogging under different injection rates 2 3 and 4 and fertilizer water ratios 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 in drip fertigation systems the surface morphology and chemical composition of the clogging substances were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry eds the results showed that the large injection rate caused uneven fertilization and the recommend injection rates of the proportional fertilizer pump were 2 and 3 in the same fertilizer solution concentration range the difference in head loss of the screen filter 0 09 7 75 m was larger than that of the disc filter 0 32 3 88 m indicating that the anti clogging performance of the disc filter was better meanwhile the application scope of the fertilizer solution concentration of the screen filter was less than 0 117 and that of the disc filter was between 0 117 and 0 296 there was a significant effect of the fertilizer solution concentrations on filter clogging p 0 05 the interaction between the fertilizer solution concentrations and filter types had a more significant effect on filter clogging p 0 01 the clogging substances consisted of undissolved phosphate fertilizers and silicates as well as carbonate and phosphate precipitations generated by chemical reactions the clogging mechanism was a physical and chemical coupling process when using phosphate fertilizers therefore the use of fertilizers especially phosphate fertilizers contributed to the generation of clogging substances fertilizer solution concentrations and type of fertilizers should therefore be considered in the anti clogging performance of filters in drip fertigation systems keywords drip irrigation hydraulic performance clogging substances electron microscopy energy dispersive analysis 1 introduction drip irrigation systems can be used for fertilization which can reduce fertilizer use increase crop yield and minimize the impact of fertilizer on the environment hernandez et al 1991 hanson et al 2006 ajdary et al 2007 li et al 2016 jayakumar et al 2017 therefore drip fertigation is an efficient and precise fertilization method however the use of fertilizer contributes to the formation and development of clogging substances in the drip fertigation systems and excessive fertilizer solution concentration aggravate the clogging process liu et al 2017 tang et al 2018 reduce the service life of the system and cause uneven fertilization eventually resulting in a decrease in economic benefits meanwhile drip fertigation is a commonly used method in arid and semi arid regions for water and fertilizer saving consequently research on the anti clogging performance of drip fertigation systems has practical significance for the widely use of the system to enhance the anti clogging performance of drip fertigation systems it is necessary for the used equipment to have efficient performance filters are the key equipment to prevent impurities in drip irrigation systems oron et al 1979 mcdonald et al 1984 tripathi et al 2014 and their good hydraulic performance can ensure the efficient operation of the systems wu et al 2015 found that the filtration efficiency of sand filters was 11 4 48 0 which increased when used with disc filters many scholars have studied filter hydraulic parameters to evaluate the anti clogging performance of different filters duran ros et al 2009 concluded that the flow rate of emitters protected by disc filters had the smallest change when compared with other filters ribeiro et al 2008 showed that the head loss changes in disc filters were more significant than those in non woven synthetic fabric filters zong et al 2012 studied the relationship between the filter head loss and flow rate when using muddy water and thought that the head loss was a key parameter to evaluate filter performance fertilizer solution concentration is another key factor that affects the clogging of drip fertigation systems various ions and impurities in fertilizer solutions react with the ions in water to form insoluble precipitates thereby increasing the clogging degree of the drip fertigation system haynes 1985 li et al 2007 tang et al 2018 stated that the fertilizer solution concentration was one of the factors affecting fertilization uniformity and poor fertilization uniformity can lead to the clogging of drip irrigation systems li et al 2015 inferred that the clogging effect of emitters was more obvious at higher fertilizer concentrations phosphorus is an essential nutrient for the growth of crops yamaji et al 2017 however the excessive use of phosphate fertilizer can easily cause water and soil pollution therefore it is best to use drip irrigation systems to effectively use phosphate fertilizer studies have shown that phosphate fertilizer aggravate the clogging of drip irrigation systems but the clogging risk of drip fertigation systems can be reduced by setting appropriate system operation patterns zhou et al 2015 tang et al 2018 the anti clogging performance of drip fertigation systems can be improved when fertilizer solution concentrations are matched with the performance of the filtration systems research on the anti clogging performance of drip irrigation systems has focused on the independent performance of each device and emitter clogging pei et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 feng et al 2017 studies on the filter anti clogging performance are mostly based on the impurities in the water source without considering the effect of fertilizers therefore the fertilization process filtration performance and clogging substances of filters in drip fertigation systems need further study the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the uniformity of the fertilizer solution concentration under different combinations of injection rates and fertilizer water ratios in drip fertigation systems 2 explore the effects of different fertilizer solution concentrations on the hydraulic performance of filters and the clogging substances of screen and disc filters the results of this study will provide a reference for the anti clogging research aiming to promote the integrated water and fertilizer technology of drip fertigation systems in arid and semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment designs the drip fertigation experiments were carried out in the shiyang river ecological water saving experimental station in gansu province from april to october of 2017 with a pre experiment and field experiment respectively the shiyang river station is located on the edge of the tengger desert which is a typical drought deficient area with an average elevation of 1581 m and drought index of 5 25 the annual average rainfall and evaporation of the station is 160 mm and 2000 mm respectively additionally the water source in the station is the shiyang river water system and three water samples were collected before the experiment table 1 presents the chemical parameters of the shiyang river water from table 1 it can be observed that the concentration of ca2 is highest in the cations and the concentrations of hco3 and so4 2 are relatively higher in the anions the ph value of water is slightly alkaline the layout of the pre experiment and field experiment is shown in fig 1 including a proportional fertilizer pump water meters with an accuracy of 2 pressure gauges valves screen filters disc filters and driplines the design flow rates of the proportional fertilizer pump range from 20 to 2 500 l h and the setting injection rate range from 1 to 4 the screen and disc filters jie yang lu mei water saving technology co ltd have an inlet diameter of 32 mm aperture 125 µm and design flow rate of 0 5 4 5 m3 h the screen of the screen filter was made of iron and the core of the disc filter was made of plastic the effective water passing area of filter is the area of the filter screen or core through which water can pass knowing the aperture size of the filter screen core the effective water passing area can be calculated the precision digital pressure gauge with an accuracy of 0 25 has a measuring range of 0 0 25 mpa y180 hangzhou mico sensor technology co ltd two types of non pressure compensating emitters were used the flat emitter rated discharge 2 03 l h emitter spacing 0 3 m and the flank labyrinth emitter 1 98 l h emitter spacing 0 15 m three kinds of fertilizers urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate were studied in the pre experiment of the drip fertigation system it was found that urea and potassium sulfate fertilizer had better solubility than the phosphate fertilizer the clogging of the drip fertigation system was induced by diammonium phosphate therefore diammonium phosphate p2o5 46 which is commonly used in the field was selected as the experimental fertilizer during the actual operation of the drip fertigation system various impurities inevitably appeared in the water source the most common ones included sand and clay particles in the soil table 2 shows the elemental content of phosphate fertilizer and soil by energy spectrum analysis the treatments were carried out at three injection rates of 2 3 4 and each treatment contained three fertilizer water ratios of 1 4 mass ratio of fertilizer to water 1 5 and 1 6 in the pre experiment table 3 meanwhile the drip fertigation system was built with a screen filter disc filter and no filter on the three parallel driplines fig 1 creating a total of 27 treatments each treatment was repeated three times the injection rate in the experimental setup was determined by the proportional fertilizer pump the purpose of setting different fertilizer water ratios was to explore the influence of diammonium phosphate solubility on filter clogging three parts of 0 87 kg of diammonium phosphate were weighed and dissolved in 3 48 kg 4 35 kg and 5 22 kg of water to obtain fertilizer water ratios of 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 the 0 87 kg fertilizer was determined by the actual fertilizer demand in the field when making the fertilizer solution the phosphate fertilizer was added to the water stirred thoroughly soaked in water for one hour then stirred again to fully dissolve it it was found that the fertilizer could not be completely dissolved and there was still a gray green powdery precipitate at the bottom of the fertilizer solution which was turbid after stirring 2 2 field experiments the field experiment was set up in a maize field with an area of 0 25 ha aiming to verify the fertilization uniformity of the fertilizer pump and further evaluate the hydraulic characteristics and anti clogging performance of the filters in practical applications xianyu 335 maize was sown on may 6 2017 and the planting method was one film one dripline and two rows of mulch with a film width of 0 12 m corn plant spacing of 0 25 m and row spacing of 0 4 m the test area was divided into eight plots arranged in four rows and two columns every four plots used the same emitters in each of the four plots three plots were treated with different fertilization treatments 2 3 4 the other was treated with fresh water as a control each plot 50 3 6 m was laid with three 50 m long driplines of the same emitter type and the three driplines were installed with a screen filter disc filter and no filter respectively the drip fertigation system layout of each plot is shown in fig 1 before planting 30 urea n 200 kg ha and all the potassium sulfate k2o 90 kg ha were applied as the base fertilizer and full irrigation was done during the entire growth period the harvest date was on september 24 a total of nine fertigations were carried out from june 6th to september 9th the diammonium phosphate p2o5 200 kg ha used was averaged into nine fertigations and 0 87 kg of diammonium phosphate was applied to each plot each time the irrigation process involved two periods namely the fertigation period and the water irrigation period first fertigation was carried out with fertilizer and water and the duration of the fertigation was 20 25 min subsequently fresh water was used for about one hour the alternate irrigation method of fertilizer solution and fresh water can effectively reduce the clogging probability of drip fertigation systems the reason for the inconsistent fertigation time was that the volume of the fertilizer solution with different fertilizer water ratios was different the head loss flow rate of the filters and fertilizer solution concentrations were measured during the fertigation period the head loss was converted from differential pressure within 1 min which was measured by pressure gauges installed at both ends of the filter the flow rate was read once every 3 min from the water meter installed behind the filter a fertilizer solution sample was taken once every 3 min at the water intake fig 1 the collected fertilizer solution sample was measured using a conductivity meter dds 11a shanghai magnetic resonance and its concentration was converted from conductivities using a concentration conversion formula phene et al 1992 machado and oliveira 2005 the screen or core are both inside the filters and they were removed from the screen disc filter and placed in the shade of ventilation to dry after the experiment then the clogging substances were scraped off and observed using a scanning electron microscope and the surface energy spectrum analysis was performed to analyze the clogging substance 2 3 uniformity indexes fertilization uniformity is one of the indexes used to assess the performance of the fertilization pump in drip fertigation systems fan et al 2016 zhou et al 2009 if the fertilization uniformity is too low the yield of crops and efficiency of fertilizer use will decrease therefore the evaluation of fertilization uniformity is essential for drip fertigation systems in the filtration system the effect of the uniformity of the fertilizer solution concentration on the performance of the filter should be verified further in this experiment three fertilization uniformity indexes were used as follows 1 the christiansen coefficient calculated in formula one christiansen 1942 1 u c 100 1 i 1 n x i x n x where u c the christiansen coefficient x the total mean of the sample x i the i th observed value n the total number of observations 2 the distribution uniformity calculated in formula two kruse 1978 where 2 du 100 x lq x du the distribution uniformity x lq the mean of the smaller quarter observations in the sample 3 the statistical uniformity calculated in formula three kruse 1978 3 c v s x x 4 s x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i 2 n 1 n i 1 n x i 2 1 2 5 u s 10 1 c v where c v is the coefficient of variation s x is the standard deviation of the observed values and u s is the statistical uniformity 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analysis of variance was performed using the microsoft excel and spss the significance was identified by the level of p p 0 05 and p 0 01 represent significant and extremely significant effects respectively 3 results 3 1 uniformity of fertilizer solution concentrations the changes of fertilizer solution concentration at the outlet of the proportional fertilizer pump using different injection rates 4 3 2 and fertilizer water ratios 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 are shown in fig 2 the fertilizer solution concentrations remained stable during the operation of the drip fertigation systems indicating that the proportional fertilizer pump had efficient running performance the christiansen coefficient distribution uniformity and statistical uniformity of the fertilizer solution concentrations are shown in table 3 as presented in table 3 there was a significant difference between the nine groups of fertilizer solution concentrations p 0 05 when the injection rate was 4 the christiansen coefficient with 1 6 fertilizer ratio was the smallest and the differences in the christiansen coefficient were significant between the 1 6 fertilizer water ratio and the other treatments p 0 05 similar to the distribution and statistical uniformity however the differences in the christiansen coefficient were not significant when the injection rates were 2 p 0 05 and 3 p 0 05 similar to the statistical and distribution uniformities respectively in general the christiansen distribution and statistical uniformity of the fertilizer solution was better when the injection rates were 2 or 3 however the three uniformity indices of the fertilizer solution was significantly different only when the injection rate was 4 especially when the fertilizer water ratio was 1 6 3 2 filter head loss and flow rate 3 2 1 head loss of screen and disc filters head loss is a key parameter for filter performance elbana et al 2013 an increase in head loss means an increase in filter clogging degree it can be observed from fig 3 that the head loss gradually increased with the increase in fertilizer solution concentrations fig 3 a shows the variation in the head loss of the screen filters for nine groups of fertilizer solution concentrations the inflexion point of the head loss appeared at approximately 3 min then basically remained stable as shown in fig 3 a when the fertilizer solution concentration was less than 0 117 injection rate of 2 with all fertilizer water ratios injection rate of 3 with the fertilizer water ratios of 1 5 and 1 6 the head loss of the screen filter was always less than 0 5 m when the fertilizer solution concentration was more than or equal to 0 117 injection rate of 4 with all fertilizer water ratios the injection rate of 3 with a fertilizer water ratio of 1 4 the variation in head loss was significant fig 3 b shows the variation in head loss of the disc filters which exhibited a slow increasing trend with time indicating that the clogging of the disc filters was a slow accumulation process table 4 shows the total head loss and total flow rate of the filters under different fertilizer solution concentrations the head loss varied significantly when clogging started in the filter it can be observed that the head loss of the disc filters was smaller than that of the screen filters when the fertilizer solution concentration exceeded 0 117 the above results showed that the clogging degree of the disc filters was smaller and the anti clogging performance was better when the fertilizer solution concentrations were between 0 117 0 296 3 2 2 flow rate of screen and disc filters the decrease in flow rates indicates an increase in filter clogging therefore the analysis of the screen and disc filter flow rates is critical for evaluating the anti clogging performance of filters fig 4 shows the relationship between the flow rates and fertilizer solution concentrations under the conditions with filters and without filter the flow rate of the screen filter was reduced from 0 4 m3 h to approximately 0 2 m3 h with an increase in fertilizer solution concentration which was a reduction of 50 compared with the screen filter the flow rate of the disc filter was reduced from 0 4 m3 h to approximately 0 3 m3 h with an increase in fertilizer solution concentration which was a reduction of 25 from the slope of the three lines in fig 4 it can be observed that the flow rate of the screen filter dropped the fastest and most indicating that the anti clogging performance of the disc filters was better 3 3 filter clogging substances clogging that occurs in the filter screen core can be physical chemical or biological bounoua et al 2016 the clogging substances in the filter screen core were observed using a scanning electron microscope meanwhile the energy spectrum analysis was performed to further clarify the clogging substances in the filters the representative particle structure was selected for observation and analysis as shown in figs 5 and 6 where wt is the mass fraction and at is the atomic percentage in fig 5 a the clogging substance was an irregular blocky particle with a honeycomb the energy spectrum analysis is shown in fig 6 compared with the phosphate fertilizer the mass fractions of c o and p in the clogging substances decreased by approximately 29 10 and 15 respectively however the mass fraction of fe had an extremely high content of 65 neither the water source nor the phosphate fertilizer can contain such a large amount of fe therefore it was inferred that the substances originated from the filter screen in fig 5 b the clogging substance was rod shaped the surface was smooth and the remaining impurities were attached the mass fractions of c and p decreased by 20 and 18 respectively but the mass fraction of o increased by 10 compared with that of the phosphate fertilizer the mass fraction of calcium was more than 24 in clogging substances from the atomic percentage of the element it was found that the atomic percentage of ca c o was 1 1 4 4 5 which was close to the caco3 atomic percentage of 1 1 3 indicating that the substances might be caco3 in fig 5 c the clogging substance was a flocculent polymer with an uneven surface the energy spectrum analysis showed that the mass fraction of the metal elements mg al ca and fe increased compared to that of the phosphate fertilizer but the mass fraction of c decreased by approximately 12 the mass fraction of p was up to 19 which was consistent with the content of p in the phosphate fertilizer therefore the clogging substance was a phosphate fertilizer particle simultaneously the atomic percentage of phosphorus to oxygen was 1 4 which can form po4 3 because shiyang river water contains a large amount of ca2 it was speculated that the po4 3 and ca2 would form insoluble precipitate substances in fig 5 d the clogging substance was blocky and irregular in shape according to the energy spectrum analysis the mass fraction of element c increased by approximately 15 compared with that of the soil and the content of si was high therefore this substance was the silicon component in the soil that entered the filtration system 4 discussion fertilization and filtration equipment are critical for avoiding emitter clogging when water and fertilizer integrated technology is applied in drip fertigation systems filtration can be used to reduce system clogging from the source of the drip fertigation systems reduce the risk of emitter clogging and achieve the large scale application of drip fertigation systems additionally the fertilizer solution concentrations and clogging substances in drip fertigation systems can affect the high efficiency and normal operation of the systems tang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to analyze the mutual performance of fertilization and filtration equipment aiming to minimize the probability of clogging in drip fertigation systems 4 1 fertilizer solution concentrations an appropriate fertilizer solution concentration can effectively improve the anti clogging performance of the filters to minimize the clogging degree caused by fertilizers this study analyzed the uniformity of the fertilizer solution concentration under different injection rates and fertilizer water ratios our study found that the fertilization uniformity of the proportional fertilizer pump was good when the injection rates were 2 and 3 however the large injection rate led to uneven fertilization resulting in poor use of the proportional fertilizer pump our study was consistent with the results of tang 2018 he inferred that the uniformity of fertilizers in fertilization equipment was worse with the increase in fertilizer solution concentration and the fertilization uniformity was lower than the irrigation uniformity in drip fertigation systems fan et al 2016 regarding fertilizer solution concentrations our results showed that the fertilizer solution concentration should be less than 0 117 when using a screen filter the disc filter was more suitable for fertilizer concentrations between 0 117 and 0 296 from the perspective of hydraulics the calculation formula for the head loss is h j ζ v 2 2 g v is the flow velocity g is gravity acceleration and ζ is the local head loss coefficient when the fertilizer solution concentration was between 0 117 and 0 296 h j d i s c h j s c r e e n but v d i s c v s c r e e n therefore ζ d i s c ζ s c r e e n the smaller local head loss coefficient ζ indicates a smaller clogging degree of filters the local head loss coefficient ζ of the disc filters was less than that of the screen filters liu et al 2017 deduced that when using a screen filter the emitter was easily clogged when the phosphate fertilizer concentration was between 0 5 and 2 0 the reasons for the differences between the two experiments were the different fertilization equipment used during the operation of the drip fertigation system a reasonable concentration of fertilizer solution should be selected to improve the uniformity of fertigation and avoid short term and efficient clogging 4 2 filter head loss and flow rates the anti clogging performance of the filters was evaluated by analyzing the head loss and flow rate of the filters the smaller the head loss is the better the anti clogging performance of the filters the analysis of the filter head loss showed that the increase in fertilizer solution concentration had a significant effect on the head loss but the significant difference in fertilizer solution concentrations did not mean that the difference between the filter head loss was significant the difference in the head loss of the screen filters 0 09 7 75 m was larger than that of the disc filters 0 32 3 88 m table 4 in the same fertilizer concentration range the flow rate of the disc filters decreased more slowly than that of the screen filters being better than the anti clogging performance of the screen filters the reason for the different head loss is that the effective water area 1600π of the disc filters is 35 times that 46π of the screen filters the filter core in the disc filter contained 100 laminates the grooves in the laminates were used to intercept the clogging substance when water passed through the laminates an analysis of variance was carried out to study the influence of the fertilizer solution concentrations filter types and their interaction on the head loss and flow rate the results are shown in tables 5 and 6 the fertilizer solution concentration had a significant effect on the filter head loss and flow rate p 0 05 and the interaction between fertilizer solution concentrations and filters had an extremely significant effect on the head loss p 0 01 it can be seen from fig 3 that the head loss increased with the increase of the fertilizer solution concentration when using the same filter indicating that the increase of fertilizer solution concentration can cause the increase of head loss and the fertilizer solution concentration had a significant impact on head loss when the fertilizer solution concentration was the same the head loss of the two filters increased with time but the growth rate was different the interaction between fertilizer solution concentration and filter type ultimately resulted in a significant difference in total head loss table 4 from fig 4 the flow rates decreased with the increase of fertilizer solution concentrations when using the same filter indicating that fertilizer solution concentrations have a significant influence on flow rates the fertilizer solution concentration interacted with the filter type which ultimately resulted in a decrease in total flow rate table 4 figs 3 and 4 show the changing process of filter clogging 4 3 filter clogging substances the clogging process of this experiment was a coupling process of physical and chemical clogging the main factors that affected the clogging process of the filters in the experiments were the water quality the soil fertilizer that entered the drip fertigation system and the reaction among them through analysis it was found that the clogging substances were not only undissolved phosphate fertilizers and silicates but also carbonate and phosphate precipitation generated by chemical reactions because of the high concentration of ca2 in the water source the higher content of the generated precipitate was caco3 the phosphorus in the filters was mainly undissolved phosphate fertilizer particles and some phosphate precipitation various ions carbonates and minerals in the water react to form precipitates and adhere to the inside of the filters although many studies have been conducted on emitter clogging in drip irrigation systems few studies have focused on the composition of the clogging substances in filters because filters and emitters are installed in series in drip irrigation systems the composition of the clogging substance in emitters can be used to verify the validity of the experiment results the combination of fertilizers and carbonate precipitates had been the main cause of clogging inducing a higher risk of clogging in drip fertigation systems sagi 1990 haynes et al 1985 deduced that phosphate fertilizer could form insoluble precipitates with ca2 and mg2 liu et al 2017 suggested that phosphate fertilizer produced cahpo4 as clogging substances aggravating the clogging of drip fertigation systems our study considered that phosphate produced some insoluble phosphate precipitations which was consistent with previous results phosphate fertilizer accelerated the flocculation of impurities and ion replacement resulting in the formation of flocs and precipitated particles li et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 li et al 2019 inferred that the precipitation of solid particles caco3 and mgco3 directly affected the clogging process of the drip fertigation system which was consistent with the results of our study li et al 2015 reported that fertilizer only aggravated the flocculation of sediments when using muddy water and ca2 and mg2 were not the main cause of clogging actually different irrigation water qualities can produce similar clogging substances such as quartz calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate and silicate however the clogging risk and induction mechanism were different depending on the type of ions in water hao et al 2017 the clogging of the drip fertigation system caused by phosphate fertilizer was because of the presence of solid particles and the reaction between the fertilizer and water the clogging mechanism induced by phosphate fertilizers in our study was mainly physical and chemical coupling some meaningful results were obtained in the experiment however there are still some issues that should be studied in future 1 although the head loss flow rates and clogging substances of filters in the drip fertigation system were analyzed the other part of the drip irrigation system was not evaluated for example the operation of the emitters under fertilizer water integration conditions needs further study 2 in the analysis of the clogging substances physical and chemical clogging were involved in the use of the phosphate fertilizer however the effect of biological clogging on the filters was not studied further research on biological clogging in drip fertigation systems should be carried out 5 conclusion studying the uniformity of fertilization and the effect of different fertilizer solution concentrations on filter clogging are the basis for the use of drip fertigation systems in the field application this study used scanning electron microscopy and eds to evaluate clogging substances with the aim of studying the formation mechanism of clogging in drip fertigation systems and ease system clogging that may induce system failure in the drip fertigation system the proper injection rate can improve fertilization uniformity and the recommend injection rates of the proportional fertilizer pump were 2 and 3 the difference in head loss of the screen filter 0 09 7 75 m was larger than that of the disc filter 0 32 3 88 m in the same fertilizer concentration range therefore the anti clogging performance of the disc filter was better when using in the long term operation in the drip fertigation system the appropriate fertilizer solution concentration in the screen filter and the disc filter were 0 117 and 0 117 0 296 respectively compared with the filter types the fertilizer solution concentration had a significant impact on the head loss and the flow rate of filters p 0 05 indicating that the fertilizer solution concentration had a significant impact on filter clogging the interaction between the fertilizer solution concentration and filter types had an extremely significant effect on the head loss p 0 01 hence the proper coordination of fertilization equipment and filters can improve the anti clogging performance of drip fertigation systems the reason for drip fertigation clogging caused by the phosphate fertilizer was the existence of solid particles and precipitations from the reaction of fertilizers and water the clogging substance included undissolved phosphate fertilizer silicate as well as carbonate precipitates and phosphate precipitation from chemical reactions the clogging mechanism was a physical and chemical coupling process when using the phosphate fertilizer chemical clogging was a critical factor that caused filter clogging and can not be ignored in the study of
