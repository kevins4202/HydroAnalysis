10490,nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen don leaching are major nitrogen n loss pathway for intensive greenhouse vegetable production system gvps quantifying the nitrate and don leaching is essential to develop best management practices in this study four seasons of tomato field experiments were conducted to test the impact of different water furrow and drip irrigation and n management practices and straw incorporation on n leaching and vegetable yield a soil crop system model whcns veg soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator for vegetables was calibrated and evaluated and results suggested that the model performed well for simulating soil water potential water drainage nitrate and don leaching crop n uptake and yield the average values of nrmse ia and nse for nitrate or don leaching ranged from 12 1 11 3 0 96 0 94 and 0 85 0 77 respectively compared with furrow irrigation and over fertilization drip fertigation treatments reduced irrigation water use water drainage nitrate and don leaching by 41 60 68 and 68 respectively without compromising crop yield straw incorporation further reduced nitrate and don leaching by 13 1 and 25 7 compared with no straw incorporation furthermore we found that don leaching accounted for 21 7 46 6 of total dissolved n leaching loss in the study area using the model we determined that the optimal water and n inputs ranged from 350 400 mm and 350 400 kg n ha 1 for the winter spring season and 200 250 mm and 150 200 kg n ha 1 for the autumn winter season this led to an 87 reduction in nitrate leaching and a 74 reduction in don leaching with only a slightly reduction in crop yield 5 compared with the local farmer practice the recommended water and n management practices achieved high crop yield with less environmental impact keywords greenhouse vegetable whcns veg model don leaching water and n management straw incorporation 1 introduction in the last 30 years the global vegetable planting area has quadrupled from 2 7 million ha in 1987 to 10 7 million ha in 2017 in order to satisfy the increasing demand for vegetables fao 2016 china produced 59 of global vegetables with 52 of global vegetable planting area in 2017 fao 2016 famers have increased water and nitrogen n inputs to obtain higher yield and income for greenhouse vegetables the current n fertilizer application rate is nearly 1000 kg n ha 1 per season for vegetable production in china which far exceeds vegetable growth needs ju et al 2006 guo et al 2010 norse and ju 2015 most of the excessive n is leached out of the root zone and enters the groundwater posing a threat to groundwater contamination and human health lv et al 2019 nitrate concentration in the groundwater in several greenhouse vegetable production regions exceeds the who s public drinking water limit of 10 mg n l 1 in china zhu et al 2005 du et al 2011 lin et al 2011 therefore best management practices bmps should be developed for sustainable cultivation of greenhouse vegetables compared with other agricultural systems greenhouse vegetable production systems gvps usually have high water and n input rates sun et al 2012 2013 many studies have shown that nitrate and don leaching are the major n loss pathways for intensive gvps min et al 2011 sun et al 2012 2013 granados et al 2013 lv et al 2019 sun et al 2012 reported that more than 35 of n fertilizer 358 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was lost by nitrate leaching under current farmer practices for greenhouse cucumber production in north china granados et al 2013 also documented that nitrate leaching could be more than 210 kg n ha 1 per season under traditional water and n management in greenhouse pepper production don leaching loss accounts for 8 8 63 of total n leaching for gvps depending on different climate soil and field management conditions min et al 2011 lv et al 2019 liang et al 2019 the threshold concentration of kjeldahl n nh4 n plus don in drinking water is 1 0 mg n l 1 in europe european community 1980 which is smaller than that of nitrate 11 3 mg n l 1 in europe and 10 mg n l 1 in us and china this indicates that don has a greater threat to human health than nitrate many studies have evaluated the effects of different field management practices on nitrate leaching and vegetable yield and recommended optimal water and n management practices gallardo et al 2009 sun et al 2019 suárez rey et al 2016 woli et al 2016 however don leaching was largely ignored in previous studies soil crop system models provide a powerful tool to estimate n leaching and evaluate the environmental impact of different water and n management practices for gvps greenwood 2001 jones et al 2003 rahn et al 2010a guo et al 2010 gallardo et al 2016 models such as n able greenwood 2001 eu rotate n rahn et al 2010b dssat jones et al 2003 vegsyst gallardo et al 2016 and whcns veg liang et al 2018 can simulate the effects of various field management practices on water consumption n fates and vegetable growth although these models have been widely used to develop optimal water and n management practices that maximize vegetable yield and reduce environmental impacts sun et al 2012 2019 woli et al 2016 suárez rey et al 2016 the don related processes were not included in the most of these models the lack of a don component limits these models for simulating and evaluating don leaching under different water and n management practice recently the whcns veg model incorporated a don component which can be used for simulating nitrate and don leaching under different water and n management practices liang et al 2019 because of the high organic n use in greenhouse production don leaching should be considered in developing best management practices bmps for intensive gvps therefore the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the effects of different water and n management practices and straw incorporation on total n leaching and tomato yield and ii optimize the water and n management practices by considering nitrate leaching don leaching and tomato yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted at the agricultural experimental station of tianjin academy of agricultural sciences n 39 25 35 e 116 57 18 in the wuqing district of tianjin city china the study area belongs to the northern temperate monsoon climate zone according to the 30 year climate data from 1987 to 2017 the mean annual air temperature at the experiment site was 12 5 c and the mean annual sunshine hours were 2392 h while the mean annual air temperature in the solar greenhouse was 22 2 c from 2016 to 2018 ebro ebi 20 germany the solar greenhouse was built in 2011 and is 62 m long 8 m wide and 1 4 m in height the soil organic carbon ph and electronic conductivity

experiment design and field management four growing seasons of tomato were grown from march 11 2016 to february 5 2018 the annual double cropping of tomato consisted of a winter spring season ws end of february to the end of june and autumn winter season aw end of august to the start of february seasons during the end of june to the end august farmers do not grow vegetable due to high temperature in solar greenhouse tomato seedlings were transplanted with the plant spacing of 0 5 m the transplanting and final harvesting dates of tomato are shown in table 2 a two factorial randomized split plot was designed with three replicates resulting in four treatments 1 furrow irrigation with conventional n fertilizer farmer s practice f 2 f maize straw incorporation fs 3 drip irrigation with optimized n fertilization d 4 d maize straw incorporation ds treatments that incorporated straw fs and ds received crushed maize straw equivalent to 3500 kg c ha 1 approximately 80 kg n ha 1 which was mixed into the 0 20 cm soil layer by a rotary machine together with the base fertilizer approximately 200 kg n ha 1 of chicken manure 1 45 n 2 30 p2o5 and 2 78 k2o was applied with the base fertilizer and also mixed into the 0 20 cm soil layer before each crop transplanting for all treatments different types of chemical fertilizer were used depending on irrigation methods synthetic fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 15 15 15 and water soluble fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 19 8 27 was used for furrow irrigation and drip fertigation treatments respectively the total chemical n application rates for all treatments are shown in table 2 furrow irrigation treatments were irrigated 9 10 times each season on 10 15 d intervals each application was approximately 60 mm half of the chemical fertilizer was applied as the base fertilizer and the other half was applied as the topdressing by dissolving the fertilizer in the irrigation water for drip irrigation treatments all of the chemical fertilizer was applied as the topdressing the frequency of drip fertigation was 1 2 d with 3 5 mm of irrigation water and 2 0 3 5 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer in each irrigation application the total amount of irrigation and chemical fertilizer applications for all treatments are shown in table 2 the size of each plot was 24 1 m2 6 7 m 3 6 m in order to minimize the lateral water seepage a plastic film with a depth of 0 6 m was used to separate each plot more detail information of field management can be found in lv et al 2019 2 3 sampling and analysis for each subplot the tomatoes were picked from one raised bed 6 7 m 0 7 m and weighed at each harvest the total yield was calculated as the cumulative weight of tomatoes from all harvest days three plants were collected at the early flowering full production and final harvesting stages to determine the n content of the plant for each plot plant samples were oven dried at 75 c to a constant weight and ground in a knife mill then placed in a ball mill mm200 germany the total n was measured using an elemental analyzer costech ech 4024 italy before starting the experiment soil samples with three replicates were obtained using a steel ring at depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm to determine the soil bulk density and hydraulic parameters table 1 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by the constant head method the relationship between soil water potential and soil water content was determined by the pressure plate method and the soil water retention curve parameters θs θr α and n were calculated by fitting van genuchten model van genuchten 1987 the daily soil water potential in each plot was measured for d and f treatments at depths of 55 and 65 cm using tensiometers dls2 cas china in each plot microporous ceramic cups were installed at a soil depth of 60 cm approximately 10 ml of leachate was collected daily for three days after each irrigation event mineral n nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the leachate were determined using a continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran luebbe norderstedt germany the total soluble n tsn in the leachate was measured by dual wavelength 220 and 275 nm ultraviolet spectrophotometry after alkaline persulfate oxidation norman et al 1985 the don concentration in leachate was determined as the difference between tsn and mineral n jones and willett 2006 the daily water flux at the soil depth of 60

growing season was calculated by summing the daily qw and qn values respectively the cumulative water drainage and n leaching was regarded as measured data which was used to calibrate and evaluate whcns veg model 2 4 whcns veg model the whcns veg model was used to simulate the effects of different water and n management practices and straw incorporation on water drainage n leaching and crop yield in the study the key processes in the model include soil water movement n transport soil c and n cycles and vegetable growth in this model the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 is used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration water infiltration is computed by the modified green ampt approach hachum and alfaro 1980 water redistribution is simulated by the richards equation in a soil profile in which plant uptake is considered as a sink simunek et al 2008 soil c and n cycling concepts were taken from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 the don components are included in the model which allows the model to simulate don release transport and transformations liang et al 2019 vegetable growth processes are described based on principles in the eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010a the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by inputs including soil properties weather data crop biological parameters and field management information a detailed model description is available in the literature liang et al 2018 2 5 scenario analysis to optimize water and n management a total of 840 scenarios combining different levels of irrigation and fertilizer for the ws and aw seasons under furrow and drip conditions were designed 15 irrigations 14 fertilizations 2 ws and aw seasons 2 furrow and drip methods the total irrigation amount for both furrow and drip irrigations ranged from 100 to 800 mm in increments of 50 mm and n application rates ranged from 50 to 700 kg n ha 1 in increments of 50 kg n ha 1 timing of irrigation and fertilizer applications was fixed based on the local farmer practice the upper limit of water and n levels were set slightly higher than the local famer practice in order to better reflect the relationship of n leaching and vegetable yield with different water and n management practices scenario analysis was based on the calibrated whcns veg model using the experimental dataset in 2016 2 6 model parameterization field data including soil water potential cumulative water drainage cumulative nitrate and don leaching crop n uptake and vegetable fresh yield in 2016 was used to calibrate model parameters data in 2017 was used to evaluate the calibrated model soil hydraulic parameters were set based on the measured values in the laboratory table 1 the initial crop parameters and n transformations parameters were set based on values in the literature hansen et al 1990 rahn et al 2010b and were calibrated using the trial and error approach to achieve the best agreement possible between simulated and measured soil water potential water drainage nitrate leaching crop n uptake and vegetable yield based on the previous studies by liang et al 2019 the don related parameters were adjusted to achieve consistency between simulated and measured cumulative don leaching the calibrated values are shown in table 3 2 7 model evaluation statistics three statistical indices were used to evaluate the model performance nrmse normalized root mean square error ia index of agreement willmott 1982 and nse nash and sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 5 n r m s e 1 m i 1 n s i m i 2 n 6 i a 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n s i m m i m 2 7

relative deviation between simulated and measured values some studies suggest that an nrmse 15 represents good agreement 15 30 moderate agreement and 30 poor agreement yang et al 2014 li et al 2015 the ia ranges between 0 and 1 while nse ranges from to 1 the closer ia or nse is to 1 the better the model performance values of ia 0 75 and nse 0 is the minimum threshold values for crop growth evaluation while values of ia 0 60 and nse 1 0 is the minimum threshold values for soil outputs evaluation yang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 soil water potential the measured and simulated soil water potential swp at different depths for f and d treatments in 2016 and 2017 are shown in figs 1 and 2 drip irrigation maintained a more stable and higher soil water content in the soil profile compared to the f treatment because of the high frequency of irrigation figs 1 and 2 in addition the swp fluctuations during the ws season were larger than those of the aw season which indicated higher water consumption during the ws season the whcns veg model reflected the effects of different irrigation methods on swp dynamic in the soil profile for the calibration and evaluation years for the d treatments the evaluation indices of nrmse ia and nse ranged from 22 9 25 9 0 827 0 846 and 0 070 0 113 respectively as shown in table 4 the model performed well in simulating swp under furrow irrigation condition figs 1a b 2 a and b however the model underestimated swp under drip irrigation condition in the end of the ws season figs 1c d 2 c and d the nse values were 6 344 and 5 294 for calibration and evaluation phases respectively which are unsatisfactory for simulating swp for treatment d table 4 3 2 water drainage the measured and simulated cumulative water drainage for f and d treatments is shown in fig 3 a the simulated actual evapotranspiration et is shown in fig 3b the irrigation method impacted water drainage and et the amount of water drainage in the f treatment was larger than that of the d treatment the average of the measured water drainage for f and d treatments was 339 and 132 mm per season respectively the et of the d treatment 225 mm per season was lower than that of the f treatment 265 mm per season approximately 52 and 35 of irrigation water was drained out root zone 0 60 cm for the f and d treatments respectively these results indicated that excess water was applied to both treatments especially for the f treatment impacted by weather conditions in the greenhouse water consumption showed a large difference between the ws and aw seasons the amount of water drainage during the aw season was higher than that of the ws season due to the relative low et in the aw season fig 3b the average et of the ws and aw seasons was 324 and 166 mm per season respectively in general the simulated water drainage agreed well with the measured values as shown in table 4 and fig 3 for furrow irrigation the values of nrmse were smaller than 5 4 and ia and nse values were larger than 0 993 0 973 for calibration and evaluation seasons table 4 the simulation accuracy of water drainage for the d treatment was slight lower than that of the f treatment the nrmse ia and nse ranged from 9 8 21 9 0 932 0 968 and 0 805 0 865 respectively table 4 3 3 nitrate and don leaching fig 4 shows the comparison of measured and simulated cumulative nitrate leaching in four growing seasons for f fs d and ds treatments in this study the irrigation method had a great effect on nitrate leaching as shown in fig 4a the average amount of the measured nitrate leaching for the furrow treatments f and fs and drip treatments d and ds was 420 and 137 kg n ha 1 per season respectively furrow irrigation increased nitrate leaching while maize straw incorporation decreased nitrate leaching fig 4b the average amount of nitrate leaching for the straw incorporation treatments 259 kg n ha 1 per season was lower than those without straw incorporation 298 kg n ha 1 per season the nitrate leaching showed a large variation in different seasons nitrate leaching loss in the ws seasons was lower than that of the aw seasons under furrow irrigation because of the relative higher water drainage that occurred during the aw season figs 3 and 4 however this phenomenon was not found in the drip irrigation treatments similar to nitrate leaching irrigation method straw incorporation and growth season had similar effects on don leaching the average amount of the measured don leaching for the f fs d and ds treatments was 214 152 63 and 53 kg n ha 1 per season respectively importantly don leaching is an important n loss pathway as illustrated in fig 6 which contributed 21 7 46 6 of total soluble n leaching the high don component may be contributed by a large amount of manure application before each crop transplanting quan et al 2015 this study suggests more attention should be focused on don leaching especially for manure input system the simulated nitrate and don leaching is shown in figs 4 and 5 the whcns veg model reflected the effects of irrigation methods and straw incorporation on nitrate and don leaching in different seasons for nitrate leaching simulations the values of nrmse ia and nse for calibration and evaluation seasons ranged from 4 6 26 0 0 860 0 989 and 0 442 0 956 respectively table 4 for don leaching simulation the average values of nrmse ia and nse for calibration were 18 1 0 961 and 0 785 and for evaluation was 4 5 0 929 and 0 648 respectively table 4 the whcns veg model simulated nitrate and don leaching well 3 4 crop n uptake and yield tables 5 and 6 shows the measured and simulated crop n uptake and yield respectively irrigation methods and straw incorporation had no great effect on crop n uptake and yield the average values of the measured crop n uptake yield in the four seasons for the f fs d and ds treatments was 145 81 165 86 175 83 and 173 kg n ha 1 86 t ha 1 respectively however the crop n uptake and yield in the ws seasons was higher than in the aw seasons tables 5 and 6 the average crop n uptake yield for ws and aw seasons was 206 98 and 117 kg n ha 1 76 t ha 1 respectively the whcns veg model achieved good agreement for crop growth variables giving values of nrmse 15 9 ia 0 933 and nse 0 703 for crop n uptake simulation table 5 and the nrmse 9 5 ia 0 948 and nse 0 827 for yield simulation table 6 to sum up whcns veg model performed well and can be used for simulating swp water drainage nitrate leaching don leaching crop n uptake and yield under different water and n management practices 3 5 optimizing water and n management the results indicated that the water consumption n leaching and crop growth largely varied in different seasons for different irrigation methods thus it is necessary to separately optimize water inputs under furrow and drip irrigation conditions for the ws and aw season fig 7 summarizes the effects of different irrigation amounts on vegetable fresh yield and n leaching under furrow and drip irrigation conditions the results indicated that the yield increased with the amount of irrigation and reached the maximum 83 and 77 t ha 1 for the ws and aw seasons respectively when the amount of irrigation was approximately 400 or 250 mm for ws or aw season fig 7 nitrate and don leaching had the similar response to irrigation amount when the total irrigation amount was lower than approximately 400 or 250 mm for ws or aw seasons the amount of nitrate and don leaching changed slightly however nitrate and don leaching increased quickly when the irrigation amount exceeded 400 or 250 mm fig 7 to reduce n leaching loss and maintain a high yield the optimum range of irrigation amount was found for the ws and aw seasons as 350 400 mm and 200 250 mm respectively a similar relationship was observed between n application rates and vegetable fresh yield in fig 8 with increasing n application rates the yield increased but when the n application rate exceeded approximately 400 or 200 kg n ha 1 for ws or aw season the vegetable yield remained constant 83 and 77 t ha 1 for ws and aw seasons respectively meanwhile the amount of nitrate and don leaching increased slightly with the increasing n application rates when the n application rate was smaller than 400 or 200 kg n ha 1 for the ws or aw seasons however when the n application rate was more than 400 or 200 kg n ha 1 for ws or aw seasons the n leaching increased dramatically these results indicate that excess n fertilizer is lost when the n application is larger than 400 or 200 kg n ha 1 for ws or aw season hence the n application rate ranging from 350 to 400 kg n ha 1 and from 150 to 200 kg n ha 1 was recommended for the ws and aw seasons respectively these rates reduce n leaching and maintain a high vegetable yield 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation method on water drainage n leaching and crop yield some studies suggest that drip irrigation or fertigation reduces irrigation water use water drainage n leaching and maintained crop yield compared to furrow irrigation sharmasarkar et al 2001 ibragimov et al 2007 sun et al 2012 granados et al 2013 fan et al 2014 sahoo et al 2018 drip irrigation saves water and fertilizer by allowing water to drip slowly to the root zone ibragimov et al 2007 reported that 18 42 of the irrigation water was saved without reduction of crop yield under drip irrigation conditions compared to furrow irrigation sahoo et al 2018 found that drip irrigation saved 38 8 of water use and produced higher crop yield sharmasarkar et al 2001 compared the water consumption between furrow and drip irrigation and suggested that the later practice decreased water drainage by 75 without compromising sugar beet yield under fertigation water and n input with low intensity and high frequency effectively matches crop water and n requirements compared with furrow irrigation fertigation not only substantially reduced water use and consumption but also decreased n fertilizer input and n leaching using the eu rotate n model sun et al 2012 documented that fertigation reduced irrigation water use by more than 60 water drainage by 70 and nitrate leaching by 75 80 with a slight decrease in cucumber yield 5 compared to furrow irrigation fan et al 2014 found that nitrate leaching and apparent nitrogen loss under fertigation was less than that of conventional furrow irrigation and crop yield increased by 9 we also found similar results in this study the average amount of irrigation water use water drainage nitrate leaching and don leaching of both f and fs treatments was 1 7 2 5 3 1 and 3 1 fold higher than that of both d and ds treatments in addition tomato yield was not affected by the different treatments therefore drip irrigation or fertigation is an efficient way to reduce water use and environmental impact and maintain high crop yields 4 2 effects of straw incorporation on n leaching and crop yield some studies have pointed out that straw incorporation had the potential to mitigate n leaching and improve crop yield sun et al 2012 fan et al 2014 yang et al 2018 for example sun et al 2012 reported that nitrate leaching was reduced by more than 30 by straw incorporation without reducting crop yield for greenhouse vegetable production fan et al 2014 found that nitrate leaching was reduced by 13 0 32 2 by straw incorporation yang et al 2018 found that straw incorporation decreased soil nitrate concentration and thus reduced soil nitrate leaching and improved crop yield in the rice wheat rotation system in this study we also found that straw incorporation reduced nitrate leaching by approximately 13 1 one reason may be that straw incorporation changes soil physical properties thereby having some impact on water drainage and n leaching straw incorporation enhances soil water holding capacity and improves soil structure by increasing soil porosity and decreasing bulk density tarekegn et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the reduction in n leaching for straw incorporation treatments may be attributed to enhanced soil water holding capacity straw incorporation also increases soil c n ratio after straw incorporation c n ratio of maize straw was approximately 44 in this study soil c n ratio plays an important role in controlling soil n immobilization and mineralization thereby impacting the soil n leaching springob and kirchmann 2003 bengtsson et al 2003 lower soil c n ratio was prone to n losses through leaching while soil mineral n was immobilized by soil microorganisms when the soil c n ratio was higher bengtsson et al 2003 in addition we found that don leaching for the straw incorporation treatments was reduced by 15 9 29 0 compared with the no straw incorporation treatments however there are few studies that have tested the effects of straw incorporation on don leaching this result may be caused by increasing soil n fixation capacity after incorporating straw with a high c n ratio further investigation with controlled soil incubation experiments may help to explore the mechanism of don release in the future 4 3 exploring optimal water and n management practices many studies suggested that water and n management practices had an impact on crop yield and n leaching zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 dai et al 2016 sun et al 2019 in a combination of field experiments and simulations sun et al 2019 reported that cucumber yield reached a maximum value as water or n input reached approximately 277 mm and 310 kg n ha 1 and nitrate leaching occurred when irrigation amounts of more than 300 mm was applied zhang et al 2015 identified the optimum range of n application rates for maize yield and nitrate leaching using the dndc model in the north china plain and found that yield increased slowly when the n application rates increased higher than 150 kg ha 1 while nitrate leaching increased sharply with n application rates over 240 kg n ha 1 best management practices are achieved when crop yields are high and n losses are low malik et al 2019 therefore the n application rate from 150 to 240 kg n ha 1 was recommended in their study in our study the optimal water and n inputs was found to be different in different seasons the optimal range of water and n input rates was 350 400 or 200 250 mm and 350 400 or 150 200 kg n ha 1 for the ws or aw seasons which reduced nitrate and don leaching by approximately 87 and 74 respectively with a slight reduction in crop yield 5 compared with the local farmer practice many previous studies reported similar results yang et al 2015 conducted a five year lysimeter experiment and found that the optimum n application rate decreased nitrate leaching by 36 while maintaining high crop yields compared to conventional farmer n fertilization based on winter wheat field experiments in the loess plateau of china dai et al 2016 documented that the n application rate should be less than 160 kg n ha 1 in order to reduce nitrate leaching and maintain a relatively high crop yield malik et al 2019 showed that the optimized water and n management strategies reduced nitrate leaching from 33 to 53 without a large reduction in yield this was likely because the optimum water and n input matched crop requirements and soil water and n supply in addition the optimum ranges of water and n application rates showed a large variation in different seasons the ws season had higher mean daily temperatures 25 1 c and 17 3 c for ws and aw seasons respectively and sunshine duration 927 and 795 h for ws and aw seasons respectively than the aw season which may have contributed to higher water consumption and n uptake in the ws season compared with the ws season water and n requirements of vegetable growth was less in the aw season however the same water and n management practices were used in ws and aw seasons in the local framer s practices and resulted in high water drainage and n leaching in the aw season these results suggested that different water and n management strategies should be adopted for ws and aw seasons in gvps in this study the calibrated whcns veg model was used to optimize water and n management practices for gvps however this model underestimated swp of drip irrigation treatments this discrepancy between simulated and measured swp can likely be attributable to the whcns veg model using the one dimension richards equation to simulate soil water dynamic under drip irrigation conditions developing an efficient two dimension modeling method may improve the simulation accuracy under drip irrigation in future work 5 conclusions the whcns veg model was successfully used to simulate the effects of different water and n management practices and straw incorporation on soil water movement n leaching and crop growth in this study the results suggested that drip irrigation with straw incorporation was an efficient way to reduce water use and n leaching while maintaining a high crop yield for greenhouse vegetable production while the current farmer practices use the same water and n management strategy for both the ws and aw seasons our results showed that et water drainage n leaching and yield had large differences for different seasons these results indicated that optimum water and n was different for different seasons using the whcns veg model total 840 scenarios combing different levels of irrigation and fertilization were designed to identify optimum water and n management practices the optimal water and n management practices were found for both the ws and aw seasons which reduced n leaching with a slight reduction in crop yield compared with the local farmer practices the whcns veg model was found to be a

10490,nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen don leaching are major nitrogen n loss pathway for intensive greenhouse vegetable production system gvps quantifying the nitrate and don leaching is essential to develop best management practices in this study four seasons of tomato field experiments were conducted to test the impact of different water furrow and drip irrigation and n management practices and straw incorporation on n leaching and vegetable yield a soil crop system model whcns veg soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator for vegetables was calibrated and evaluated and results suggested that the model performed well for simulating soil water potential water drainage nitrate and don leaching crop n uptake and yield the average values of nrmse ia and nse for nitrate or don leaching ranged from 12 1 11 3 0 96 0 94 and 0 85 0 77 respectively compared with furrow irrigation and over fertilization drip fertigation treatments reduced irrigation water use water drainage nitrate and don leaching by 41 60 68 and 68 respectively without compromising crop yield straw incorporation further reduced nitrate and don leaching by 13 1 and 25 7 compared with no straw incorporation furthermore we found that don leaching accounted for 21 7 46 6 of total dissolved n leaching loss in the study area using the model we determined that the optimal water and n inputs ranged from 350 400 mm and 350 400 kg n ha 1 for the winter spring season and 200 250 mm and 150 200 kg n ha 1 for the autumn winter season this led to an 87 reduction in nitrate leaching and a 74 reduction in don leaching with only a slightly reduction in crop yield 5 compared with the local farmer practice the recommended water and n management practices achieved high crop yield with less environmental impact keywords greenhouse vegetable whcns veg model don leaching water and n management straw incorporation 1 introduction in the last 30 years the global vegetable planting area has quadrupled from 2 7 million ha in 1987 to 10 7 million ha in 2017 in order to satisfy the increasing demand for vegetables fao 2016 china produced 59 of global vegetables with 52 of global vegetable planting area in 2017 fao 2016 famers have increased water and nitrogen n inputs to obtain higher yield and income for greenhouse vegetables the current n fertilizer application rate is nearly 1000 kg n ha 1 per season for vegetable production in china which far exceeds vegetable growth needs ju et al 2006 guo et al 2010 norse and ju 2015 most of the excessive n is leached out of the root zone and enters the groundwater posing a threat to groundwater contamination and human health lv et al 2019 nitrate concentration in the groundwater in several greenhouse vegetable production regions exceeds the who s public drinking water limit of 10 mg n l 1 in china zhu et al 2005 du et al 2011 lin et al 2011 therefore best management practices bmps should be developed for sustainable cultivation of greenhouse vegetables compared with other agricultural systems greenhouse vegetable production systems gvps usually have high water and n input rates sun et al 2012 2013 many studies have shown that nitrate and don leaching are the major n loss pathways for intensive gvps min et al 2011 sun et al 2012 2013 granados et al 2013 lv et al 2019 sun et al 2012 reported that more than 35 of n fertilizer 358 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was lost by nitrate leaching under current farmer practices for greenhouse cucumber production in north china granados et al 2013 also documented that nitrate leaching could be more than 210 kg n ha 1 per season under traditional water and n management in greenhouse pepper production don leaching loss accounts for 8 8 63 of total n leaching for gvps depending on different climate soil and field management conditions min et al 2011 lv et al 2019 liang et al 2019 the threshold concentration of kjeldahl n nh4 n plus don in drinking water is 1 0 mg n l 1 in europe european community 1980 which is smaller than that of nitrate 11 3 mg n l 1 in europe and 10 mg n l 1 in us and china this indicates that don has a greater threat to human health than nitrate many studies have evaluated the effects of different field management practices on nitrate leaching and vegetable yield and recommended optimal water and n management practices gallardo et al 2009 sun et al 2019 suárez rey et al 2016 woli et al 2016 however don leaching was largely ignored in previous studies soil crop system models provide a powerful tool to estimate n leaching and evaluate the environmental impact of different water and n management practices for gvps greenwood 2001 jones et al 2003 rahn et al 2010a guo et al 2010 gallardo et al 2016 models such as n able greenwood 2001 eu rotate n rahn et al 2010b dssat jones et al 2003 vegsyst gallardo et al 2016 and whcns veg liang et al 2018 can simulate the effects of various field management practices on water consumption n fates and vegetable growth although these models have been widely used to develop optimal water and n management practices that maximize vegetable yield and reduce environmental impacts sun et al 2012 2019 woli et al 2016 suárez rey et al 2016 the don related processes were not included in the most of these models the lack of a don component limits these models for simulating and evaluating don leaching under different water and n management practice recently the whcns veg model incorporated a don component which can be used for simulating nitrate and don leaching under different water and n management practices liang et al 2019 because of the high organic n use in greenhouse production don leaching should be considered in developing best management practices bmps for intensive gvps therefore the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the effects of different water and n management practices and straw incorporation on total n leaching and tomato yield and ii optimize the water and n management practices by considering nitrate leaching don leaching and tomato yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted at the agricultural experimental station of tianjin academy of agricultural sciences n 39 25 35 e 116 57 18 in the wuqing district of tianjin city china the study area belongs to the northern temperate monsoon climate zone according to the 30 year climate data from 1987 to 2017 the mean annual air temperature at the experiment site was 12 5 c and the mean annual sunshine hours were 2392 h while the mean annual air temperature in the solar greenhouse was 22 2 c from 2016 to 2018 ebro ebi 20 germany the solar greenhouse was built in 2011 and is 62 m long 8 m wide and 1 4 m in height the soil organic carbon ph and electronic conductivity

experiment design and field management four growing seasons of tomato were grown from march 11 2016 to february 5 2018 the annual double cropping of tomato consisted of a winter spring season ws end of february to the end of june and autumn winter season aw end of august to the start of february seasons during the end of june to the end august farmers do not grow vegetable due to high temperature in solar greenhouse tomato seedlings were transplanted with the plant spacing of 0 5 m the transplanting and final harvesting dates of tomato are shown in table 2 a two factorial randomized split plot was designed with three replicates resulting in four treatments 1 furrow irrigation with conventional n fertilizer farmer s practice f 2 f maize straw incorporation fs 3 drip irrigation with optimized n fertilization d 4 d maize straw incorporation ds treatments that incorporated straw fs and ds received crushed maize straw equivalent to 3500 kg c ha 1 approximately 80 kg n ha 1 which was mixed into the 0 20 cm soil layer by a rotary machine together with the base fertilizer approximately 200 kg n ha 1 of chicken manure 1 45 n 2 30 p2o5 and 2 78 k2o was applied with the base fertilizer and also mixed into the 0 20 cm soil layer before each crop transplanting for all treatments different types of chemical fertilizer were used depending on irrigation methods synthetic fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 15 15 15 and water soluble fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 19 8 27 was used for furrow irrigation and drip fertigation treatments respectively the total chemical n application rates for all treatments are shown in table 2 furrow irrigation treatments were irrigated 9 10 times each season on 10 15 d intervals each application was approximately 60 mm half of the chemical fertilizer was applied as the base fertilizer and the other half was applied as the topdressing by dissolving the fertilizer in the irrigation water for drip irrigation treatments all of the chemical fertilizer was applied as the topdressing the frequency of drip fertigation was 1 2 d with 3 5 mm of irrigation water and 2 0 3 5 kg n ha 1 of fertilizer in each irrigation application the total amount of irrigation and chemical fertilizer applications for all treatments are shown in table 2 the size of each plot was 24 1 m2 6 7 m 3 6 m in order to minimize the lateral water seepage a plastic film with a depth of 0 6 m was used to separate each plot more detail information of field management can be found in lv et al 2019 2 3 sampling and analysis for each subplot the tomatoes were picked from one raised bed 6 7 m 0 7 m and weighed at each harvest the total yield was calculated as the cumulative weight of tomatoes from all harvest days three plants were collected at the early flowering full production and final harvesting stages to determine the n content of the plant for each plot plant samples were oven dried at 75 c to a constant weight and ground in a knife mill then placed in a ball mill mm200 germany the total n was measured using an elemental analyzer costech ech 4024 italy before starting the experiment soil samples with three replicates were obtained using a steel ring at depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm to determine the soil bulk density and hydraulic parameters table 1 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by the constant head method the relationship between soil water potential and soil water content was determined by the pressure plate method and the soil water retention curve parameters θs θr α and n were calculated by fitting van genuchten model van genuchten 1987 the daily soil water potential in each plot was measured for d and f treatments at depths of 55 and 65 cm using tensiometers dls2 cas china in each plot microporous ceramic cups were installed at a soil depth of 60 cm approximately 10 ml of leachate was collected daily for three days after each irrigation event mineral n nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the leachate were determined using a continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran luebbe norderstedt germany the total soluble n tsn in the leachate was measured by dual wavelength 220 and 275 nm ultraviolet spectrophotometry after alkaline persulfate oxidation norman et al 1985 the don concentration in leachate was determined as the difference between tsn and mineral n jones and willett 2006 the daily water flux at the soil depth of 60

growing season was calculated by summing the daily qw and qn values respectively the cumulative water drainage and n leaching was regarded as measured data which was used to calibrate and evaluate whcns veg model 2 4 whcns veg model the whcns veg model was used to simulate the effects of different water and n management practices and straw incorporation on water drainage n leaching and crop yield in the study the key processes in the model include soil water movement n transport soil c and n cycles and vegetable growth in this model the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 is used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration water infiltration is computed by the modified green ampt approach hachum and alfaro 1980 water redistribution is simulated by the richards equation in a soil profile in which plant uptake is considered as a sink simunek et al 2008 soil c and n cycling concepts were taken from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 the don components are included in the model which allows the model to simulate don release transport and transformations liang et al 2019 vegetable growth processes are described based on principles in the eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010a the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by inputs including soil properties weather data crop biological parameters and field management information a detailed model description is available in the literature liang et al 2018 2 5 scenario analysis to optimize water and n management a total of 840 scenarios combining different levels of irrigation and fertilizer for the ws and aw seasons under furrow and drip conditions were designed 15 irrigations 14 fertilizations 2 ws and aw seasons 2 furrow and drip methods the total irrigation amount for both furrow and drip irrigations ranged from 100 to 800 mm in increments of 50 mm and n application rates ranged from 50 to 700 kg n ha 1 in increments of 50 kg n ha 1 timing of irrigation and fertilizer applications was fixed based on the local farmer practice the upper limit of water and n levels were set slightly higher than the local famer practice in order to better reflect the relationship of n leaching and vegetable yield with different water and n management practices scenario analysis was based on the calibrated whcns veg model using the experimental dataset in 2016 2 6 model parameterization field data including soil water potential cumulative water drainage cumulative nitrate and don leaching crop n uptake and vegetable fresh yield in 2016 was used to calibrate model parameters data in 2017 was used to evaluate the calibrated model soil hydraulic parameters were set based on the measured values in the laboratory table 1 the initial crop parameters and n transformations parameters were set based on values in the literature hansen et al 1990 rahn et al 2010b and were calibrated using the trial and error approach to achieve the best agreement possible between simulated and measured soil water potential water drainage nitrate leaching crop n uptake and vegetable yield based on the previous studies by liang et al 2019 the don related parameters were adjusted to achieve consistency between simulated and measured cumulative don leaching the calibrated values are shown in table 3 2 7 model evaluation statistics three statistical indices were used to evaluate the model performance nrmse normalized

relative deviation between simulated and measured values some studies suggest that an nrmse 15 represents good agreement 15 30 moderate agreement and 30 poor agreement yang et al 2014 li et al 2015 the ia ranges between 0 and 1 while nse ranges from to 1 the closer ia or nse is to 1 the better the model performance values of ia 0 75 and nse 0 is the minimum threshold values for crop growth evaluation while values of ia 0 60 and nse 1 0 is the minimum threshold values for soil outputs evaluation yang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 soil water potential the measured and simulated soil water potential swp at different depths for f and d treatments in 2016 and 2017 are shown in figs 1 and 2 drip irrigation maintained a more stable and higher soil water content in the soil profile compared to the f treatment because of the high frequency of irrigation figs 1 and 2 in addition the swp fluctuations during the ws season were larger than those of the aw season which indicated higher water consumption during the ws season the whcns veg model reflected the effects of different irrigation methods on swp dynamic in the soil profile for the calibration and evaluation years for the d treatments the evaluation indices of nrmse ia and nse ranged from 22 9 25 9 0 827 0 846 and 0 070 0 113 respectively as shown in table 4 the model performed well in simulating swp under furrow irrigation condition figs 1a b 2 a and b however the model underestimated swp under drip irrigation condition in the end of the ws season figs 1c d 2 c and d the nse values were 6 344 and 5 294 for calibration and evaluation phases respectively which are unsatisfactory for simulating swp for treatment d table 4 3 2 water drainage the measured and simulated cumulative water drainage for f and d treatments is shown in fig 3 a the simulated actual evapotranspiration et is shown in fig 3b the irrigation method impacted water drainage and et the amount of water drainage in the f treatment was larger than that of the d treatment the average of the measured water drainage for f and d treatments was 339 and 132 mm per season respectively the et of the d treatment 225 mm per season was lower than that of the f treatment 265 mm per season approximately 52 and 35 of irrigation water was drained out root zone 0 60 cm for the f and d treatments respectively these results indicated that excess water was applied to both treatments especially for the f treatment impacted by weather conditions in the greenhouse water consumption showed a large difference between the ws and aw seasons the amount of water drainage during the aw season was higher than that of the ws season due to the relative low et in the aw season fig 3b the average et of the ws and aw seasons was 324 and 166 mm per season respectively in general the simulated water drainage agreed well with the measured values as shown in table 4 and fig 3 for furrow irrigation the values of nrmse were smaller than 5 4 and ia and nse values were larger than 0 993 0 973 for calibration and evaluation seasons table 4 the simulation accuracy of water drainage for the d treatment was slight lower than that of the f treatment the nrmse ia and nse ranged from 9 8 21 9 0 932 0 968 and 0 805 0 865 respectively table 4 3 3 nitrate and don leaching fig 4 shows the comparison of measured and simulated cumulative nitrate leaching in four growing seasons for f fs d and ds treatments in this study the irrigation method had a great effect on nitrate leaching as shown in fig 4a the average amount of the measured nitrate leaching for the furrow treatments f and fs and drip treatments d and ds was 420 and 137 kg n ha 1 per season respectively furrow irrigation increased nitrate leaching while maize straw incorporation decreased nitrate leaching fig 4b the average amount of nitrate leaching for the straw incorporation treatments 259 kg n ha 1 per season was lower than those without straw incorporation 298 kg n ha 1 per season the nitrate leaching showed a large variation in different seasons nitrate leaching loss in the ws seasons was lower than that of the aw seasons under furrow irrigation because of the relative higher water drainage that occurred during the aw season figs 3 and 4 however this phenomenon was not found in the drip irrigation treatments similar to nitrate leaching irrigation method straw incorporation and growth season had similar effects on don leaching the average amount of the measured don leaching for the f fs d and ds treatments was 214 152 63 and 53 kg n ha 1 per season respectively importantly don leaching is an important n loss pathway as illustrated in fig 6 which contributed 21 7 46 6 of total soluble n leaching the high don component may be contributed by a large amount of manure application before each crop transplanting quan et al 2015 this study suggests more attention should be focused on don leaching especially for manure input system the simulated nitrate and don leaching is shown in figs 4 and 5 the whcns veg model reflected the effects of irrigation methods and straw incorporation on nitrate and don leaching in different seasons for nitrate leaching simulations the values of nrmse ia and nse for calibration and evaluation seasons ranged from 4 6 26 0 0 860 0 989 and 0 442 0 956 respectively table 4 for don leaching simulation the average values of nrmse ia and nse for calibration were 18 1 0 961 and 0 785 and for evaluation was 4 5 0 929 and 0 648 respectively table 4 the whcns veg model simulated nitrate and don leaching well 3 4 crop n uptake and yield tables 5 and 6 shows the measured and simulated crop n uptake and yield respectively irrigation methods and straw incorporation had no great effect on crop n uptake and yield the average values of the measured crop n uptake yield in the four seasons for the f fs d and ds treatments was 145 81 165 86 175 83 and 173 kg n ha 1 86 t ha 1 respectively however the crop n uptake and yield in the ws seasons was higher than in the aw seasons tables 5 and 6 the average crop n uptake yield for ws and aw seasons was 206 98 and 117 kg n ha 1 76 t ha 1 respectively the whcns veg model achieved good agreement for crop growth variables giving values of nrmse 15 9 ia 0 933 and nse 0 703 for crop n uptake simulation table 5 and the nrmse 9 5 ia 0 948 and nse 0 827 for yield simulation table 6 to sum up whcns veg model performed well and can be used for simulating swp water drainage nitrate leaching don leaching crop n uptake and yield under different water and n management practices 3 5 optimizing water and n management the results indicated that the water consumption n leaching and crop growth largely varied in different seasons for different irrigation methods thus it is necessary to separately optimize water inputs under furrow and drip irrigation conditions for the ws and aw season fig 7 summarizes the effects of different irrigation amounts on vegetable fresh yield and n leaching under furrow and drip irrigation conditions the results indicated that the yield increased with the amount of irrigation and reached the maximum 83 and 77 t ha 1 for the ws and aw seasons respectively when the amount of irrigation was approximately 400 or 250 mm for ws or aw season fig 7 nitrate and don leaching had the similar response to irrigation amount when the total irrigation amount was lower than approximately 400 or 250 mm for ws or aw seasons the amount of nitrate and don leaching changed slightly however nitrate and don leaching increased quickly when the irrigation amount exceeded 400 or 250 mm fig 7 to reduce n leaching loss and maintain a high yield the optimum range of irrigation amount was found for the ws and aw seasons as 350 400 mm and 200 250 mm respectively a similar relationship was observed between n application rates and vegetable fresh yield in fig 8 with increasing n application rates the yield increased but when the n application rate exceeded approximately 400 or 200 kg n ha 1 for ws or aw season the vegetable yield remained constant 83 and 77 t ha 1 for ws and aw seasons respectively meanwhile the amount of nitrate and don leaching increased slightly with the increasing n application rates when the n application rate was smaller than 400 or 200 kg n ha 1 for the ws or aw seasons however when the n application rate was more than 400 or 200 kg n ha 1 for ws or aw seasons the n leaching increased dramatically these results indicate that excess n fertilizer is lost when the n application is larger than 400 or 200 kg n ha 1 for ws or aw season hence the n application rate ranging from 350 to 400 kg n ha 1 and from 150 to 200 kg n ha 1 was recommended for the ws and aw seasons respectively these rates reduce n leaching and maintain a high vegetable yield 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation method on water drainage n leaching and crop yield some studies suggest that drip irrigation or fertigation reduces irrigation water use water drainage n leaching and maintained crop yield compared to furrow irrigation sharmasarkar et al 2001 ibragimov et al 2007 sun et al 2012 granados et al 2013 fan et al 2014 sahoo et al 2018 drip irrigation saves water and fertilizer by allowing water to drip slowly to the root zone ibragimov et al 2007 reported that 18 42 of the irrigation water was saved without reduction of crop yield under drip irrigation conditions compared to furrow irrigation sahoo et al 2018 found that drip irrigation saved 38 8 of water use and produced higher crop yield sharmasarkar et al 2001 compared the water consumption between furrow and drip irrigation and suggested that the later practice decreased water drainage by 75 without compromising sugar beet yield under fertigation water and n input with low intensity and high frequency effectively matches crop water and n requirements compared with furrow irrigation fertigation not only substantially reduced water use and consumption but also decreased n fertilizer input and n leaching using the eu rotate n model sun et al 2012 documented that fertigation reduced irrigation water use by more than 60 water drainage by 70 and nitrate leaching by 75 80 with a slight decrease in cucumber yield 5 compared to furrow irrigation fan et al 2014 found that nitrate leaching and apparent nitrogen loss under fertigation was less than that of conventional furrow irrigation and crop yield increased by 9 we also found similar results in this study the average amount of irrigation water use water drainage nitrate leaching and don leaching of both f and fs treatments was 1 7 2 5 3 1 and 3 1 fold higher than that of both d and ds treatments in addition tomato yield was not affected by the different treatments therefore drip irrigation or fertigation is an efficient way to reduce water use and environmental impact and maintain high crop yields 4 2 effects of straw incorporation on n leaching and crop yield some studies have pointed out that straw incorporation had the potential to mitigate n leaching and improve crop yield sun et al 2012 fan et al 2014 yang et al 2018 for example sun et al 2012 reported that nitrate leaching was reduced by more than 30 by straw incorporation without reducting crop yield for greenhouse vegetable production fan et al 2014 found that nitrate leaching was reduced by 13 0 32 2 by straw incorporation yang et al 2018 found that straw incorporation decreased soil nitrate concentration and thus reduced soil nitrate leaching and improved crop yield in the rice wheat rotation system in this study we also found that straw incorporation reduced nitrate leaching by approximately 13 1 one reason may be that straw incorporation changes soil physical properties thereby having some impact on water drainage and n leaching straw incorporation enhances soil water holding capacity and improves soil structure by increasing soil porosity and decreasing bulk density tarekegn et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the reduction in n leaching for straw incorporation treatments may be attributed to enhanced soil water holding capacity straw incorporation also increases soil c n ratio after straw incorporation c n ratio of maize straw was approximately 44 in this study soil c n ratio plays an important role in controlling soil n immobilization and mineralization thereby impacting the soil n leaching springob and kirchmann 2003 bengtsson et al 2003 lower soil c n ratio was prone to n losses through leaching while soil mineral n was immobilized by soil microorganisms when the soil c n ratio was higher bengtsson et al 2003 in addition we found that don leaching for the straw incorporation treatments was reduced by 15 9 29 0 compared with the no straw incorporation treatments however there are few studies that have tested the effects of straw incorporation on don leaching this result may be caused by increasing soil n fixation capacity after incorporating straw with a high c n ratio further investigation with controlled soil incubation experiments may help to explore the mechanism of don release in the future 4 3 exploring optimal water and n management practices many studies suggested that water and n management practices had an impact on crop yield and n leaching zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 dai et al 2016 sun et al 2019 in a combination of field experiments and simulations sun et al 2019 reported that cucumber yield reached a maximum value as water or n input reached approximately 277 mm and 310 kg n ha 1 and nitrate leaching occurred when irrigation amounts of more than 300 mm was applied zhang et al 2015 identified the optimum range of n application rates for maize yield and nitrate leaching using the dndc model in the north china plain and found that yield increased slowly when the n application rates increased higher than 150 kg ha 1 while nitrate leaching increased sharply with n application rates over 240 kg n ha 1 best management practices are achieved when crop yields are high and n losses are low malik et al 2019 therefore the n application rate from 150 to 240 kg n ha 1 was recommended in their study in our study the optimal water and n inputs was found to be different in different seasons the optimal range of water and n input rates was 350 400 or 200 250 mm and 350 400 or 150 200 kg n ha 1 for the ws or aw seasons which reduced nitrate and don leaching by approximately 87 and 74 respectively with a slight reduction in crop yield 5 compared with the local farmer practice many previous studies reported similar results yang et al 2015 conducted a five year lysimeter experiment and found that the optimum n application rate decreased nitrate leaching by 36 while maintaining high crop yields compared to conventional farmer n fertilization based on winter wheat field experiments in the loess plateau of china dai et al 2016 documented that the n application rate should be less than 160 kg n ha 1 in order to reduce nitrate leaching and maintain a relatively high crop yield malik et al 2019 showed that the optimized water and n management strategies reduced nitrate leaching from 33 to 53 without a large reduction in yield this was likely because the optimum water and n input matched crop requirements and soil water and n supply in addition the optimum ranges of water and n application rates showed a large variation in different seasons the ws season had higher mean daily temperatures 25 1 c and 17 3 c for ws and aw seasons respectively and sunshine duration 927 and 795 h for ws and aw seasons respectively than the aw season which may have contributed to higher water consumption and n uptake in the ws season compared with the ws season water and n requirements of vegetable growth was less in the aw season however the same water and n management practices were used in ws and aw seasons in the local framer s practices and resulted in high water drainage and n leaching in the aw season these results suggested that different water and n management strategies should be adopted for ws and aw seasons in gvps in this study the calibrated whcns veg model was used to optimize water and n management practices for gvps however this model underestimated swp of drip irrigation treatments this discrepancy between simulated and measured swp can likely be attributable to the whcns veg model using the one dimension richards equation to simulate soil water dynamic under drip irrigation conditions developing an efficient two dimension modeling method may improve the simulation accuracy under drip irrigation in future work 5 conclusions the whcns veg model was successfully used to simulate the effects of different water and n management practices and straw incorporation on soil water movement n leaching and crop growth in this study the results suggested that drip irrigation with straw incorporation was an efficient way to reduce water use and n leaching while maintaining a high crop yield for greenhouse vegetable production while the current farmer practices use the same water and n management strategy for both the ws and aw seasons our results showed that et water drainage n leaching and yield had large differences for different seasons these results indicated that optimum water and n was different for different seasons using the whcns veg model total 840 scenarios combing different levels of irrigation and fertilization were designed to identify optimum water and n management practices the optimal water and n management practices were found for both the ws and aw seasons which reduced n leaching with a slight reduction in crop yield compared with the local farmer practices the whcns veg model was found to be a

10491,measurements of water consumption by plants are not often used in irrigation management due to the high cost and difficulty of measurement however new methods based on sap flow monitoring enable accurate estimation of plant transpiration the objective of this work was to develop a sap flow sensor to reliably evaluate crop water stress index cwsisapflow to diagnose water status of coffee plants in response to 3 cycles of water suppression and recovery thus proposing a critical water stress index for conilon coffee plants coffea canephora sixteen potted coffee plants were randomly monitored under two water status treatments in eight plants the soil was watered and maintained at field capacity moisture irrigated treatment and the other eight plants were subjected to water stress by water withholding non irrigated treatment the calibration of the sap flow sensor allowed the conception of the proposed crop water stress index which was compared to leaf water potential stomatal conductance transpiration and net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate a coefficient based on actual transpiration was calculated to validate the crop water stress index the sap flow sensor can be used for determining sap flow in conilon coffee plants as well as elaborating a crop water stress index and estimating crop water status quickly and at relatively low cost a critical value 0 4 for the crop water stress index cwsisapflow in conilon coffee plants allows accurate scheduling the best time to initiate irrigation avoiding physiological damage to the plant keywords coffea canephora water consumption plant transpiration irrigation management 1 introduction ongoing climate changes are expected to negatively affect coffee crops which is one of the most heavily globally traded agricultural commodities damatta et al 2019 indeed several model based studies have predicted serious impacts on coffee crops due to increases in temperatures and altered precipitation patterns including substantial reductions in agro climatic zoning and losses of areas adequate for coffee production in many countries bunn et al 2015 magrach and ghazoul 2015 moat et al 2017 however the negative effects of global warming on the coffee crops might be lower than previously assumed due to among other things the plants tolerance and mitigation strategies damatta et al 2018 ramalho et al 2018 climate changes at the present time are causing shifts in the pattern of the world s rainfall resulting in both extreme drought episodes and heavy precipitation ipcc 2019 increased average global temperatures are likely to change precipitation and atmospheric moisture including shifts towards more extreme precipitation during storms in addition warmer temperatures may lead to increased drying accelerating the onset of drought episodes ipcc 2019 drought impairs coffee plants during all phases of their growth cycle but impairments are much more pronounced during the bean filling phase damatta et al 2018 a strong carbon imbalance has been observed during the phase between photoassimilate production due to overall decreases in net co2 assimilation rate a and total leaf area as well as in photoassimilate requirements because fruits are the strongest and highest priority sinks for coffee assimilates damatta and ramalho 2006 at coffee leaf scale stomatal conductance gs is strongly correlated with a meinzer et al 1992 and transpiration e the sensitivity of gs to leaf water potential at predawn ψpd and leaf to air vapor pressure difference vpdleaf air pinheiro et al 2005 suggests that gs is a key factor limiting both coffee transpiration and yield as reductions in gs occur stomatal limitations to photosynthesis are thought to be intensified during drought progression contributing to the limitation of coffee transpiration and in turn yield damatta and ramalho 2006 in addition under severe drought conditions non stomatal limitation of photosynthesis becomes important damatta et al 1997 under rapidly imposed water deficit ψw 3 0 mpa initial ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase activity rubisco but not its concentration decreased by ca 60 but when water deficit was imposed slowly the concentration was also reduced kanechi et al 1991 cultivar dependent responses to drought have been observed in coffee plants based on their physiological performance under water stress conditions tausend et al 2000 from a study with excised branches of three arabica coffee cultivars at ψpd 2 5 mpa hydraulic conductivity decreased between 29 and 50 depending on the cultivar in another study a threshold value of ψpd at which net co2 assimilation rate begins to decline due to water limitation was suggested to be close to 1 0 mpa for potted arabica coffee plants growing in drying soil kumar and tieszen 1980 however almeida and maestri 1997 from an experiment using four arabica coffee cultivars in pots reported exponential decreases r2 0 99 in potential photosynthetic capacity amax saturating co2 5 kpa which started to occur even at ψpd as high as 0 5 mpa damatta and ramalho 2006 reported that these results are difficult to reconcile with field experiments in which a expressed on a leaf area basis measured throughout the morning were maintained at control levels with predawn ψpd as low as 1 5 mpa in coffee plants drought reduces 1 the number of fruiting nodes per tree 2 the number of fruits per node and or 3 the beans size depending on its timing and severity the effect on final yield however will depend on whether the number of fruits is greater or less than the number that can be sustained by the tree which is a function of leaf area on the other hand excessive fruiting will lead to reduction of the potential number of flowering nodes with implications for yields in the following year carr 2001 this study concluded that rainfall variability is one of the main factors contributing to this instability but the effects of drought are unable to be quantified with precision indicating an uncertainty of where and when irrigation is worthwhile and how should be performed effectively carr 2001 the use of irrigation has allowed the establishment of coffee cultivation in low altitude regions with high temperatures it is accepted that irrigation is an increasingly important management option for efficient coffee production in the face of climate change ramirez villegas et al 2012 one critical factor for the irrigation management of coffee crops is to accurately quantify the volume of water to be applied since this directly affects the crop productivity even though advances in water supply technologies are available for plants irrigation management is still inadequate in most of the coffee producing regions the lack of basic information on crop water demand is a major cause of the inefficient use of this resource marin et al 2016 carr 2001 reported that there is a need to interpret and apply scientific understanding of the water relations on the coffee growth and development and this should be translated into practical instructions to assist farmers to plan and use the water efficiently either by rainfall or using irrigation techniques to obtain reliable and high quality yields water consumption by irrigated crops is often assessed using evapotranspiration and crop coefficients pereira et al 2015 guimarães et al 2019 universally adopted as a standard procedure for irrigation management rosa et al 2012 taylor et al 2015 however there is room for improvement in this method in order to consider the different physiological responses of each culture to water deficit the determination of sap flow using thermoelectric methods allows estimation of whole plant transpiration as well as from leaves or branches estimation of whole plant transpiration is ineffective using porometry infrared gas analysis at leaf scale and pressure chamber sap flow measurements have shown satisfactory results enabling the evaluation of the direct response of the plant to irrigation angelocci et al 2004 cermak et al 2004 in addition sap flow measurement is a potential tool for irrigation management as it is a parameter indicative of plant water status reflecting the interactions between the amount of water available in the soil and the atmospheric water demand ortuño et al 2006 which is important for the characterization of the water stress from the calculation of the evapotranspiration using consolidated methods pereira et al 2015 and sap flow measurements by thermoelectric methods it is possible to estimate transpiration rate and elaborate water stress indexes for different crops sakuratani 1981 cammalleri et al 2013 han et al 2018 studies using sap flow measurements have been carried out in many important crops including coffee fu et al 2016 lópez lópez et al 2018 pereira et al 2006 zhao et al 2015 tausend et al 2000 studied water use hydraulic properties and xylem vulnerability to cavitation in three cultivars of coffea arabica l finding greater differences between cultivars mostly under water stress they also found that all cultivars shared the same functional relationship between integrated daily sap flow and soil leaf pathway apparent hydraulic conductance even in different operating ranges sarmiento soler et al 2019 monitored sap flux density using a granier thermal dissipation method to access both the water consumption of coffee and water competition between coffee and shade tree species these authors showed that daily water consumption of coffee plants was 1 2 0 64 l d 1 and this did not differ between systems however further research using the sap flow method should be conducted to use sap flow in the management of irrigation in coffee plants the sap flow method has been used to assess the transpiration of several crops however the use of this technology in the irrigation management depends on further studies mainly for coffee cultivation thus the objective of this work was to develop a sap flow sensor based on heat pulse to reliably evaluate crop water stress index cwsisapflow in coffee plant with the aim of diagnosing the coffee water status in response to 3 cycles of water suppression and recovery these results were used to propose a critical water stress index for conilon coffee coffea canephora 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental conditions the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at the state university of northern fluminense darcy ribeiro uenf campos dos goytacazes rio de janeiro state brazil located at 21 44 47 s 41 18 24 w 10 m above sea level with climate aw wet tropical climate with rainy summer dry winter and the coldest monthly temperature above 18 c köeppen 1948 coffea canephora cv conilon plants denominated genotype 12 v belonging to variety vitória incaper 8142 were used in their early stages of development six months after the seedlings implementation of the experimental treatments began six months after planting to allow better conditioning and plant development the plants were placed in 20 liter plastic pots filled with commercial substrate and earthworm humus in the proportion 80 and 20 respectively of the pot volume presenting moisture at field capacity equal to 24 the soil was maintained in chemical and physical conditions suitable for coffee cultivation three liters of gravel was placed in the bottom of the pots before adding the substrate in order to avoid water accumulation a completely randomized arrangement was used with 2 treatments and 8 replications totaling 16 plants which were watered to field capacity in the evening prior to starting all experiments from the sixteen plants eight were watered to soil field capacity irrigated treatment i and the other eight plants were subjected to water withhold non irrigated treatment ni for the ni treatment water supply was withheld abruptly until they reached a leaf water potential ψw between 2 0 and 3 0 mpa which is considered as severe water stress for coffee plants silva et al 2010 after that the plants were irrigated for 7 days recovery time of optimal plant water status the i and ni treatments were carried out in 2015 during three successive evaluation cycles the first from june 9th to 23rd 14 days the second from july 14th to 28th 14 days and the third from august 18th to 28th 10 days for the first cycle the period of data acquisition was coincident with the water withhold duration but for the second and third cycles data acquisition continued after the irrigation was restarted for ni plants for 3 days up to july 31st and for 4 days up to september 1st respectively treatments were reversed after completion of each evaluation cycle so the plants submitted to irrigation at field capacity i were those that had been stressed in the previous cycle ni while the non irrigated plants ni were those that had been previously submitted to field capacity i as three evaluation cycles were carried out the reversal of the treatments occurred twice irrigation was performed manually with the aid of a millimeter container every 2 days irrigation management was done via soil by weighing the pots and replacing the water difference between two irrigations 2 2 meteorological conditions data from the national institute of meteorology brazil were used collected from a meteorological station located 7 km from the experiment site average temperatures tave for first second and third cycles ranged from 18 6 to 26 3 c from 21 0 to 27 4 c and from 19 8 to 25 1 c respectively fig 1 average maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperatures for each cycle were 31 2 and 15 3 c 31 3 and 18 8 c and 30 8 and 13 9 c respectively for the first second and third cycles for the same period the relative humidity rh ranged from 72 5 to 92 2 for the first cycle from 70 0 to 81 3 for the second cycle and from 60 6 to 79 6 for the third cycle fig 1 the maximum photosynthetically active radiation inside the greenhouse was 700 μmol m 2 s 1 according to coste 1992 damatta and ramalho 2006 partelli et al 2010 pohlan and janssens 2012 and ngolo et al 2018 the weather conditions regarding relative humidity and maximum minimum and average temperature fig 1 during cycle evaluation were suitable for coffea canephora the reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated according to penman monteith fao 56 bulletin allen et al 1998 from eq 1 using data for temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed with a wind speed equal to 0 2 m s 1 recommended

engineering laboratory leag located at the agricultural sciences and technologies center ccta of the state university of northern fluminense darcy ribeiro uenf campos dos goytacazes rj brazil the sensors are based on the heat pulse method that relates the speed of the heat pulse with the speed of sap displacement in plant organs the basic principle of this method is to promote sap heating at a given point of the plant organ followed by tracking the heat along the sap s path using temperature sensors marshall 1958 the proposed sensor fig 2 consists of a set of thermocouple wires and a constantan heating wire arranged parallel to one another and surrounded by an enameled copper wire attached to one end of an acrylic plate length 70 mm width 12 mm height 4 mm the mounting of the wires on the acrylic plate meant that the thermocouple wire is 4 5 cm from the plate and the heating wire is 7 cm from the acrylic plate thermocouple reference point was located at 10 12 cm from the other end and then it was set on the acrylic plate the sensors were connected to dataloggers model cr1000 campbell scientific usa for acquisition and storage of data data collector promoted the heating and cooling of the sensor by controlling the passage of electric current across the constantan wire during predefined time intervals triggering and disabling a relay the temperature variation was measured using the thermocouple wire and the values recorded continuously every 30 s allowing the calculation of their variation between two times of interest during both the heating and cooling cycles one sensor was installed per plant in a plagiotropic branch from the lower third of the coffee plant between the 5th and 6th pair of leaves the sensors were fixed with the heating wire and the thermocouple wires wound twice around the chosen branch to protect the sensor glass wool coated felt on one side with aluminized kraft paper length 2 5 cm and width 2 5 cm was used in order to minimize the influence of ambient temperature on the sensor readings to calibrate the sap flow sensors data was assessed at daytime using the daily reference evapotranspiration rate eto mm h ¹ during the period before the evaluation period 2 4 evaluated variables all analyzed variables were collected during the 2 treatments irrigated and non irrigated and with 8 repetitions totaling 16 plants sampled for each of the 3 cycles soil moisture was monitored daily in all treated plants at a depth of 10 cm from the surface and 5 cm distance from the stem using a portable meter soil moisture meter extech instruments a flir company mo 750 three readings were carried out per pot and after the reading the average humidity values were calculated for all the treatments the physiological status of the plants was assessed at specific dates during the monitoring cycles after the implementation of the treatments on the 1st 7th 10th and 14th days for first and third cycles and the 1st 7th 10th 14th and 17th days for the second cycle leaf water potential was obtained using a scholander type pressure chamber soil moisture plant water status console model 3115 measurements were performed at predawn ψpd between 4 30 and 5 30 a m and midday ψmd between 12 00 and 13 00 p m according to scholander et al 1965 net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate a stomatal conductance gs and transpiration e were measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer irga li 6400 model li cor usa carried out on a fully expanded leaf from the same plagiotrophic branch used to measure the sap flow the measurements were performed from 08 00 to 10 00 a m and from 12 00 a m to 2 00 p m with an artificial light source led and photosynthetic photon flux adjusted to 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 during the evaluations the initial concentration of co2 in the chamber was kept at approximately 380 30 μmol mol 1 air temperature relative humidity inside the chamber and the leaf area used in the equipment were 30 1 0 15 c 61 0 13 and 6 cm² respectively daily average values for the daytime period 12 h interval from 6 00 a m to 6 00 p m for variables a gs or e zdx were obtained from the weighted average between the values of the measurements made from 08 00 to 10 00 a m and from 12 00 a m to 2 00 p m on the same day eq 2 2 z d x 3 z m o r n i n g 2 z a f t e r n o o m 6 where z m o r n i n g a or gs or e values measured from 8 00 to 10 00 a m z a f t e r n o o n a or gs or e values measured from 12 00 a m to 2 00 p m x varied from 1 to 8 as replications of each treatment and the numbers 3 2 and 6 are weighting factors that resulted from the following assumptions i the value of variables a gs or e increase linearly both from zero to z m o r n i n g values between 6 00 a m and 8 00 a m and from z m o r n i n g to z a f t e r n o o n values between 8 00 a m and 12 00 p m and ii the value of variables a gs or e between 12 00 a m to 4 00 p m and between 4 00 and 6 00 p m decrease linearly in a symmetrical form with the increment assumed in the morning period that is with the same slopes but with opposite signs 2 5 statistical analysis regression analysis to compare the actual output of the sensor and the reference evapotranspiration was carried to calibrate the sap flow sensors data processing and statistical analysis were carried out using the program r core team which calculated mean standard deviation and confidence interval α 5 for each variable analyzed 2 6 crop water stress index using the sap flow sensor cwsisapflow and the irga equipment cwsit the temperature variation produced by intermittent cycles of heating and cooling due to application of heat pulses in alternate intervals of 90 s of heating and 90 s of cooling was defined as measured variable of the sensor intermittent heating and cooling cycles occurred at regular intervals of three minutes eq 3 was used to determine the temperature variation δ t h the temperature values measured at 10 90 100 and 180 s after the start of heating supply 3 δ t h t 90 t 10 t 100 t 180 2 where δ t h temperature changes in the plant during the pulse t 10 temperature measured by the sensor 10 s after the start of the pulse t 90 temperature measured by the sensor 90 seconds after the start of the pulse t 100 temperature measured by the sensor 100 s after the start of the pulse and t 180 temperature measured by the sensor 180 s after the start of the pulse with the change in temperature the actual output of the sensor was defined λ eq 4 4 λ 1 δ t h δ t h 0 where λ sensor signal dimensionless δ t h 0 temperature range measured by the sensor installed on the plant at zero flow condition at night and δ t h temperature range measured by the sensor installed on the plant at one point in time during the day assuming a linear relationship between the signal measured by the sensor λ and sap flow the amount of sap flow can be estimated using eq 5 5 j k λ where j sap flow density m3 s 1 m 2 and k coefficient depending on the wood and sap thermal properties diffusivity and thermal capacity and the sensor geometry the current transpiration water loss by a plant through its leaves was estimated by eq 6 6 e l j s a l a o r e l k λ s a l a where e l transpiration per unit of leaf area m3 s 1 m 2 s a cross section of the branch where the sensor was installed m2 and l a leaf area above of the branch where the sensor was installed m2 relating the hourly average of the sensor signal λ with the hourly reference evapotranspiration eto under conditions that show no water stress to the plant that is a situation in which the water deficit is equal to zero d e f 0 and assuming a linear relationship between λ and eto eq 7 is obtained 7 λ d e f 0 a e t o where a is the slope coefficient adjusted by linear regression between the sensor signal and hourly reference evapotranspiration eto leaf potential transpiration e l ˆ for plants without water stress was estimated by eq 8 8 e l ˆ d e f 0 k a e t o s a l a d e f 0 therefore crop water stress index cwsisapflow was estimated by the ratio between the current transpiration and leaf potential transpiration by applying the previous equations eq 9 9 c w s i s a p f l o w 1 e l e l d e f 0 1 λ a e t o where e l the sum of daily transpiration of plant subject to water restrictions ni and t l d e f 0 the sum of daily transpiration of the plant without water restriction i therefore the crop water stress index can be estimated only with the sensor signal and its relationship to reference evapotranspiration when considering that the relationship between the cross section of the branch and the leaf area remains constant during the evaluation period for cwsisapflow validation a crop water stress index cwsit based on the daily actual plant transpiration values e obtained by the irga equipment was calculated using eq 10 10 c w s i x n i 1 e d x n i e m 1 e d x n i j 1 8 e d x i r 8 c w s i t j 1 8 c w s i x n i 8 where x varies from 1 to 8 according to the identification of each repetition each plant for each treatment c w s i x n i is the irga proposed stress index value for each plant each replication of the non irrigated treatment using the irga measurements e d x n i and e d x i r are the average daily transpiration values of each plant obtained by eq 2 from the irga measurements in non irrigated and irrigated treatments respectively and em is the daily transpiration mean value representing the irrigated treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluated variables for both the coffee water soil and plant status fig 3 and the physiological traits fig 4 a significant statistical difference is observed when the error bars that represent the standard deviations of the mean sdm for i and ni no longer overlap on the same date day after initiating treatment significant differences between values of soil moisture leaf water potential at pre dawn ψpd and at midday ψmd were detected for all evaluated cycles in which ni presented lower averages in comparison with i fig 3 periods of significant difference figs 3 and 4 indicate that the reduction of soil water content by evapotranspiration and water redistribution inside the soil especially for ni were enough to cause the distinction between the treatments with reestablishment of irrigation at the end of the 14th day of second cycle and 10th day of the third cycle soil moisture ψpd and ψmd showed no significant difference between treatments for the next date of evaluation fig 3 that is irrigation replenished the soil water lost by evapotranspiration eliminating the stress in the evaluated plant ψpd and ψmd values fig 3 from d to i reflected the decrease in soil moisture fig 3a c for ni reaching significantly negative values and ensuring the implementation of severe water stress for the treatment in question according to silva et al 2010 for a particular clone of conilon coffee ψpd of between 1 5 and 3 0 mpa causes moderate to severe water stress respectively by the time ni plants reached the maximum negative ψpd and ψmd no symptoms of leaf wilting were observed in any of the cycles conilon plants maintain high relative water content even at significantly negative leaf water potential visible symptoms of leaf wilting are rare because turgor loss point usually around 90 is related to high rigidity of cell walls presenting leaf water potential ranging from 1 7 to 2 2 mpa for irrigated clones and reaching more negative values for non irrigated clones damatta et al 1993 2002 pinheiro et al 2005 the greater dispersion of soil moisture for cycle 1 fig 3a influenced stomatal conductance transpiration and net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate during this cycle fig 4j m and p since they are directly dependent processes of soil water availability bergonci and pereira 2002 larcher 2004 andrade et al 2015 the significant difference between i and ni treatments figs 3 and 4 confirmed the water stress condition of the plant proposed by the present research but it did not quantify the level of stress being indicated to elaborate the cwsisapflow for this purpose based on the aforementioned stress condition for convenience and ease in automation 3 2 calibration of sap flow sensors the main objective achieved from the calibration of the sap flow sensor fig 5 was to determine the adjustment coefficient a of eq 6 for the continuity of the cwsisapflow elaboration process based on the subsequent equations the proposed sensor model showed good correlation with eto based on the coefficient of determination with satisfactory linear correlation fig 5 the results corroborate with the findings of conejero et al 2006 that after studying sap flow by a compensation heat pulse method in peach trees under water deficit and recovery from drought stress found linear correlation between sensor signal and eto with valued of r² equal to 0 77 the statistically significant linear relationship fig 5 obtained between the actual sensor signal λ and the reference evapotranspiration eto for the irrigated condition i confirmed the linearity condition of eq 6 allowing us to obtain the adjustment coefficient a of the same equation thus λ was only in function of eto as eto is directly related to plant transpiration eq 7 the cwsisapflow could be elaborated relating the current transpiration with maximum potential plant transpiration eq 8 for the cwsisapflow developed here the value 0 zero indicates absence of water stress and the value one 1 indicates maximum water stress in the present study for ni the cwsisapflow varied within the estimated range so that it is possible to identify water status of the plants with a statistically significant difference in relation to i treatment fig 6 it is important to emphasize that since the cwsisapflow is not an absolute value but a relation between the current transpiration measured indirectly by the sensor signal and the potential transpiration of the plant in question previously determined the plant water status can be identified only by the actual sensor signal λ received without the need to determine transpiration itself a more laborious and relatively expensive process this sap flow sensor estimated plant transpiration faster and cheaper than irga method infrared gas analyzer 3 3 proposed crop water stress index cwsisapflow variation of the cwsisapflow between zero no drought and 1 0 severe water stress in response to water stress ni and full irrigated conditions i is showed in fig 6 the statistical differentiation of cwsisapflow starts on the 6th day after initiation of the treatments for the first and third cycles and on the 11th day for second cycle fig 6 for ni after the application of the irrigation on the 15th and 10th days for the second and third cycles respectively days with cwsisapflow maximum values there was no significant difference between treatments agreeing with figs 3 and 4 the higher cwsisapflow variation of i treatment in the first cycle fig 6 is justified by the greater soil moisture variation presented for the same trait and the same cycle fig 3a represented by a higher standard deviation of the mean compared to soil moisture in the other two cycles the increase in cwsisapflow for i treatment on the 8th 12th and 14th day for the first cycle from the 10th and the 14th day for the second cycle and on the 8th and 12th day for the third cycle fig 6 suggests low sap flow related to low plant transpiration on the days in question what was to be expected then for the same period lower values of tmax and tmed fig 1 were observed low temperatures negatively affect stomatal conductance and transpiration praxedes et al 2006 partelli et al 2009 2010 2011a 2011b fernandes et al 2012 according to pimentel et al 2010 the sap flow decreases influenced by low temperatures and high relative humidity with correlation between variables with r² value of 0 6 and 0 7 respectively 3 4 cwsisapflow validation the cwsisapflow was compared to a cwsit calculated based on the measurement of the actual plant transpiration using irga equipment for ni treatment fig 7 for first and third cycles the cwsit presented significantly lower values for some dates in relation to the cwsisapflow fig 7 however for the second cycle throughout all the evaluation period there was no significant difference between cwsisapflow and cwsit low difference between the two coefficients of water stress fig 7 was observed both cwsisapflow and cwsit reflected the plant water status under conditions of low water availability values close up to 1 0 or in easily available water conditions values close to zero thus the sap flow sensor can be used to reliably determine the level of water stress of conilon coffee plants 3 5 relationship between evaluated variables and crop water stress index cwsisapflow fig 8 demonstrates the relationship between the evaluated variables and cwsisapflow besides indicating critical values of cwsisapflow from which the water stress condition started results obtained from the sap flow sensor fig 8 allow one to infer plant water condition considering the good correlation r2 0 75 between cwsisapflow and ψpd widely used as a crop water status indicator silva et al 2003 larcher 2004 fig 8 a and b presents data assessed during the conduction of cycles for i and at the beginning of each cycle for ni when the plants were not under influence of water stress it shows the wide variation in the values for cwsisapflow 0 0 and 0 5 low variation of ψpd 0 0 and 0 5 mpa and ψmd 0 5 and 1 3 mpa however for ni with the intense increase of water stress there was a decrease in the variation of cwsisapflow values from 0 6 to 0 9 and an increase in the variation of ψpd 0 6 to 2 3 mpa and ψmd 0 6 to 2 5 mpa the reduction of soil moisture fig 3 caused a decrease in the amount of water available for the plant fig 4 and a reduction in transpiration maestri and vieira 1958 tenhunen et al 1987 larcher 2004 this resulted in increase of cwsisapflow and decreased stomatal conductance gs values for ni plants fig 8d corroborating with damatta et al 2002 and silva et al 2010 cwsisapflow had a polynomial relationship with net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate a presenting relatively low rates of net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate for conilon coffee plants fig 8 compared to other woody species pinheiro et al 2004 2005 ronchi et al 2005 praxedes et al 2006 recording maximums values around 11 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 similar to andrade et al 2015 however for conilon coffee plants clone 12 v there was a variation in the net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate without water stress of between 7 73 and 12 24 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 which was higher than the values found in the literature water deficit in coffee causes a reduction in the net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate due to a reduction in stomatal conductance under water stress conditions the influx of co2 in the substomatal chamber is reduced due to stomatal closure or the direct effects of dehydration on the photochemical or biochemical reactions of photosynthesis andrade et al 2015 costa and marenco 2007 results observed for soil moisture ψpd ψmd fig 3 gs e and a fig 8d f during the evaluated cycles corroborate with above mentioned authors ni plants presented lower values of a in comparison to i plants in the same period in which gs was significantly lower as well according to cornic 2000 under moderate water stress conditions stomatal closure severely restricts net photosynthetic co2 assimilation so that stomatal control has been considered as the main limiting factor of net photosynthetic co2 assimilation araujo et al 2008 states that low photosynthetic rates in some woody species as coffea arabica can be attributed mainly to lower values of stomatal conductance silva et al 2010 verified a sharp reduction in stomatal conductance of conilon coffee plants under water deficit compared to a small reduction in the net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate it was also verified that stomatal closure caused proportionately greater decreases in transpiration than net photosynthetic co2 assimilation since instant water use efficiency a e increased under water stress conditions these data are indicative that the reduction of photosynthesis due to water stress was associated mainly to co2 diffusion limitations and not to biochemical limitations of the photochemical or biochemical reactions of photosynthesis damatta and ramalho 2006 during the beginning of each cycle the coffee plants had statistically equal values for soil moisture ψpd and ψmd gs e and a among the treatments fig 8 however with the worsening in water stress for the ni treatment decreases in the values of the variables in question was observed concomitant with increasing cwsisapflow the reduction on values of the abovementioned variables began with values of cwsisapflow between 0 4 and 0 6 which are suggested by the present study as critical values for cwsisapflow for conilon coffee plants clone 12 v in early stages of development subjected to water stress from june to september in the region studied here finally studies of irrigation management based on cwsisapflow are encouraged by the authors since as seen in the present study cwsisapflow values above 0 4 provide a significant drop in the processes of stomatal conductance transpiration and net photosynthetic co2 assimilation fig 8 initiating a water stress condition in the plant thus with the constant monitoring of the cwsisapflow variation using the sap flow sensor for a particular plant irrigation will be necessary whenever the cwsisapflow reaches the suggested critical value 0 4 for the crop in question there is also the possibility of automated irrigation based on the current sensor response to start water application automatically every time the sap sensor reading reaches a value corresponding to the critical value of cwsisapflow 4 conclusions the proposed sap flow sensor can be used for determining sap flow in young conilon coffee plants by measuring crop water stress index cwsisapflow and estimating crop water status more quickly and at lower cost than previous methods the cwsisapflow showed good correlation with the percentage of soil moisture leaf water potential stomatal conductance transpiration and net photosynthetic co2 assimilation of the conilon coffee plant clone studied here the present study suggests a critical value for cwsisapflow of 0 4 from which point conilon coffee plants suffer from water stress during the early stages of their development a critical value of crop water stress index cwsisapflow for conilon coffee plants allows the estimation with good precision of the critical time to start irrigation avoiding physiological damage to the plant the present work proposes a new methodology for estimating the cwsi with

10491,measurements of water consumption by plants are not often used in irrigation management due to the high cost and difficulty of measurement however new methods based on sap flow monitoring enable accurate estimation of plant transpiration the objective of this work was to develop a sap flow sensor to reliably evaluate crop water stress index cwsisapflow to diagnose water status of coffee plants in response to 3 cycles of water suppression and recovery thus proposing a critical water stress index for conilon coffee plants coffea canephora sixteen potted coffee plants were randomly monitored under two water status treatments in eight plants the soil was watered and maintained at field capacity moisture irrigated treatment and the other eight plants were subjected to water stress by water withholding non irrigated treatment the calibration of the sap flow sensor allowed the conception of the proposed crop water stress index which was compared to leaf water potential stomatal conductance transpiration and net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate a coefficient based on actual transpiration was calculated to validate the crop water stress index the sap flow sensor can be used for determining sap flow in conilon coffee plants as well as elaborating a crop water stress index and estimating crop water status quickly and at relatively low cost a critical value 0 4 for the crop water stress index cwsisapflow in conilon coffee plants allows accurate scheduling the best time to initiate irrigation avoiding physiological damage to the plant keywords coffea canephora water consumption plant transpiration irrigation management 1 introduction ongoing climate changes are expected to negatively affect coffee crops which is one of the most heavily globally traded agricultural commodities damatta et al 2019 indeed several model based studies have predicted serious impacts on coffee crops due to increases in temperatures and altered precipitation patterns including substantial reductions in agro climatic zoning and losses of areas adequate for coffee production in many countries bunn et al 2015 magrach and ghazoul 2015 moat et al 2017 however the negative effects of global warming on the coffee crops might be lower than previously assumed due to among other things the plants tolerance and mitigation strategies damatta et al 2018 ramalho et al 2018 climate changes at the present time are causing shifts in the pattern of the world s rainfall resulting in both extreme drought episodes and heavy precipitation ipcc 2019 increased average global temperatures are likely to change precipitation and atmospheric moisture including shifts towards more extreme precipitation during storms in addition warmer temperatures may lead to increased drying accelerating the onset of drought episodes ipcc 2019 drought impairs coffee plants during all phases of their growth cycle but impairments are much more pronounced during the bean filling phase damatta et al 2018 a strong carbon imbalance has been observed during the phase between photoassimilate production due to overall decreases in net co2 assimilation rate a and total leaf area as well as in photoassimilate requirements because fruits are the strongest and highest priority sinks for coffee assimilates damatta and ramalho 2006 at coffee leaf scale stomatal conductance gs is strongly correlated with a meinzer et al 1992 and transpiration e the sensitivity of gs to leaf water potential at predawn ψpd and leaf to air vapor pressure difference vpdleaf air pinheiro et al 2005 suggests that gs is a key factor limiting both coffee transpiration and yield as reductions in gs occur stomatal limitations to photosynthesis are thought to be intensified during drought progression contributing to the limitation of coffee transpiration and in turn yield damatta and ramalho 2006 in addition under severe drought conditions non stomatal limitation of photosynthesis becomes important damatta et al 1997 under rapidly imposed water deficit ψw 3 0 mpa initial ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase activity rubisco but not its concentration decreased by ca 60 but when water deficit was imposed slowly the concentration was also reduced kanechi et al 1991 cultivar dependent responses to drought have been observed in coffee plants based on their physiological performance under water stress conditions tausend et al 2000 from a study with excised branches of three arabica coffee cultivars at ψpd 2 5 mpa hydraulic conductivity decreased between 29 and 50 depending on the cultivar in another study a threshold value of ψpd at which net co2 assimilation rate begins to decline due to water limitation was suggested to be close to 1 0 mpa for potted arabica coffee plants growing in drying soil kumar and tieszen 1980 however almeida and maestri 1997 from an experiment using four arabica coffee cultivars in pots reported exponential decreases r2 0 99 in potential photosynthetic capacity amax saturating co2 5 kpa which started to occur even at ψpd as high as 0 5 mpa damatta and ramalho 2006 reported that these results are difficult to reconcile with field experiments in which a expressed on a leaf area basis measured throughout the morning were maintained at control levels with predawn ψpd as low as 1 5 mpa in coffee plants drought reduces 1 the number of fruiting nodes per tree 2 the number of fruits per node and or 3 the beans size depending on its timing and severity the effect on final yield however will depend on whether the number of fruits is greater or less than the number that can be sustained by the tree which is a function of leaf area on the other hand excessive fruiting will lead to reduction of the potential number of flowering nodes with implications for yields in the following year carr 2001 this study concluded that rainfall variability is one of the main factors contributing to this instability but the effects of drought are unable to be quantified with precision indicating an uncertainty of where and when irrigation is worthwhile and how should be performed effectively carr 2001 the use of irrigation has allowed the establishment of coffee cultivation in low altitude regions with high temperatures it is accepted that irrigation is an increasingly important management option for efficient coffee production in the face of climate change ramirez villegas et al 2012 one critical factor for the irrigation management of coffee crops is to accurately quantify the volume of water to be applied since this directly affects the crop productivity even though advances in water supply technologies are available for plants irrigation management is still inadequate in most of the coffee producing regions the lack of basic information on crop water demand is a major cause of the inefficient use of this resource marin et al 2016 carr 2001 reported that there is a need to interpret and apply scientific understanding of the water relations on the coffee growth and development and this should be translated into practical instructions to assist farmers to plan and use the water efficiently either by rainfall or using irrigation techniques to obtain reliable and high quality yields water consumption by irrigated crops is often assessed using evapotranspiration and crop coefficients pereira et al 2015 guimarães et al 2019 universally adopted as a standard procedure for irrigation management rosa et al 2012 taylor et al 2015 however there is room for improvement in this method in order to consider the different physiological responses of each culture to water deficit the determination of sap flow using thermoelectric methods allows estimation of whole plant transpiration as well as from leaves or branches estimation of whole plant transpiration is ineffective using porometry infrared gas analysis at leaf scale and pressure chamber sap flow measurements have shown satisfactory results enabling the evaluation of the direct response of the plant to irrigation angelocci et al 2004 cermak et al 2004 in addition sap flow measurement is a potential tool for irrigation management as it is a parameter indicative of plant water status reflecting the interactions between the amount of water available in the soil and the atmospheric water demand ortuño et al 2006 which is important for the characterization of the water stress from the calculation of the evapotranspiration using consolidated methods pereira et al 2015 and sap flow measurements by thermoelectric methods it is possible to estimate transpiration rate and elaborate water stress indexes for different crops sakuratani 1981 cammalleri et al 2013 han et al 2018 studies using sap flow measurements have been carried out in many important crops including coffee fu et al 2016 lópez lópez et al 2018 pereira et al 2006 zhao et al 2015 tausend et al 2000 studied water use hydraulic properties and xylem vulnerability to cavitation in three cultivars of coffea arabica l finding greater differences between cultivars mostly under water stress they also found that all cultivars shared the same functional relationship between integrated daily sap flow and soil leaf pathway apparent hydraulic conductance even in different operating ranges sarmiento soler et al 2019 monitored sap flux density using a granier thermal dissipation method to access both the water consumption of coffee and water competition between coffee and shade tree species these authors showed that daily water consumption of coffee plants was 1 2 0 64 l d 1 and this did not differ between systems however further research using the sap flow method should be conducted to use sap flow in the management of irrigation in coffee plants the sap flow method has been used to assess the transpiration of several crops however the use of this technology in the irrigation management depends on further studies mainly for coffee cultivation thus the objective of this work was to develop a sap flow sensor based on heat pulse to reliably evaluate crop water stress index cwsisapflow in coffee plant with the aim of diagnosing the coffee water status in response to 3 cycles of water suppression and recovery these results were used to propose a critical water stress index for conilon coffee coffea canephora 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental conditions the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at the state university of northern fluminense darcy ribeiro uenf campos dos goytacazes rio de janeiro state brazil located at 21 44 47 s 41 18 24 w 10 m above sea level with climate aw wet tropical climate with rainy summer dry winter and the coldest monthly temperature above 18 c köeppen 1948 coffea canephora cv conilon plants denominated genotype 12 v belonging to variety vitória incaper 8142 were used in their early stages of development six months after the seedlings implementation of the experimental treatments began six months after planting to allow better conditioning and plant development the plants were placed in 20 liter plastic pots filled with commercial substrate and earthworm humus in the proportion 80 and 20 respectively of the pot volume presenting moisture at field capacity equal to 24 the soil was maintained in chemical and physical conditions suitable for coffee cultivation three liters of gravel was placed in the bottom of the pots before adding the substrate in order to avoid water accumulation a completely randomized arrangement was used with 2 treatments and 8 replications totaling 16 plants which were watered to field capacity in the evening prior to starting all experiments from the sixteen plants eight were watered to soil field capacity irrigated treatment i and the other eight plants were subjected to water withhold non irrigated treatment ni for the ni treatment water supply was withheld abruptly until they reached a leaf water potential ψw between 2 0 and 3 0 mpa which is considered as severe water stress for coffee plants silva et al 2010 after that the plants were irrigated for 7 days recovery time of optimal plant water status the i and ni treatments were carried out in 2015 during three successive evaluation cycles the first from june 9th to 23rd 14 days the second from july 14th to 28th 14 days and the third from august 18th to 28th 10 days for the first cycle the period of data acquisition was coincident with the water withhold duration but for the second and third cycles data acquisition continued after the irrigation was restarted for ni plants for 3 days up to july 31st and for 4 days up to september 1st respectively treatments were reversed after completion of each evaluation cycle so the plants submitted to irrigation at field capacity i were those that had been stressed in the previous cycle ni while the non irrigated plants ni were those that had been previously submitted to field capacity i as three evaluation cycles were carried out the reversal of the treatments occurred twice irrigation was performed manually with the aid of a millimeter container every 2 days irrigation management was done via soil by weighing the pots and replacing the water difference between two irrigations 2 2 meteorological conditions data from the national institute of meteorology brazil were used collected from a meteorological station located 7 km from the experiment site average temperatures tave for first second and third cycles ranged from 18 6 to 26 3 c from 21 0 to 27 4 c and from 19 8 to 25 1 c respectively fig 1 average maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperatures for each cycle were 31 2 and 15 3 c 31 3 and 18 8 c and 30 8 and 13 9 c respectively for the first second and third cycles for the same period the relative humidity rh ranged from 72 5 to 92 2 for the first cycle from 70 0 to 81 3 for the second cycle and from 60 6 to 79 6 for the third cycle fig 1 the maximum photosynthetically active radiation inside the greenhouse was 700 μmol m 2 s 1 according to coste 1992 damatta and ramalho 2006 partelli et al 2010 pohlan and janssens 2012 and ngolo et al 2018 the weather conditions regarding relative humidity and maximum minimum and average temperature fig 1 during cycle evaluation were suitable for coffea canephora the reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated according to penman monteith fao 56 bulletin allen et al 1998 from eq 1 using data for temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed with a wind speed equal to 0 2 m s 1 recommended

engineering laboratory leag located at the agricultural sciences and technologies center ccta of the state university of northern fluminense darcy ribeiro uenf campos dos goytacazes rj brazil the sensors are based on the heat pulse method that relates the speed of the heat pulse with the speed of sap displacement in plant organs the basic principle of this method is to promote sap heating at a given point of the plant organ followed by tracking the heat along the sap s path using temperature sensors marshall 1958 the proposed sensor fig 2 consists of a set of thermocouple wires and a constantan heating wire arranged parallel to one another and surrounded by an enameled copper wire attached to one end of an acrylic plate length 70 mm width 12 mm height 4 mm the mounting of the wires on the acrylic plate meant that the thermocouple wire is 4 5 cm from the plate and the heating wire is 7 cm from the acrylic plate thermocouple reference point was located at 10 12 cm from the other end and then it was set on the acrylic plate the sensors were connected to dataloggers model cr1000 campbell scientific usa for acquisition and storage of data data collector promoted the heating and cooling of the sensor by controlling the passage of electric current across the constantan wire during predefined time intervals triggering and disabling a relay the temperature variation was measured using the thermocouple wire and the values recorded continuously every 30 s allowing the calculation of their variation between two times of interest during both the heating and cooling cycles one sensor was installed per plant in a plagiotropic branch from the lower third of the coffee plant between the 5th and 6th pair of leaves the sensors were fixed with the heating wire and the thermocouple wires wound twice around the chosen branch to protect the sensor glass wool coated felt on one side with aluminized kraft paper length 2 5 cm and width 2 5 cm was used in order to minimize the influence of ambient temperature on the sensor readings to calibrate the sap flow sensors data was assessed at daytime using the daily reference evapotranspiration rate eto mm h ¹ during the period before the evaluation period 2 4 evaluated variables all analyzed variables were collected during the 2 treatments irrigated and non irrigated and with 8 repetitions totaling 16 plants sampled for each of the 3 cycles soil moisture was monitored daily in all treated plants at a depth of 10 cm from the surface and 5 cm distance from the stem using a portable meter soil moisture meter extech instruments a flir company mo 750 three readings were carried out per pot and after the reading the average humidity values were calculated for all the treatments the physiological status of the plants was assessed at specific dates during the monitoring cycles after the implementation of the treatments on the 1st 7th 10th and 14th days for first and third cycles and the 1st 7th 10th 14th and 17th days for the second cycle leaf water potential was obtained using a scholander type pressure chamber soil moisture plant water status console model 3115 measurements were performed at predawn ψpd between 4 30 and 5 30 a m and midday ψmd between 12 00 and 13 00 p m according to scholander et al 1965 net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate a stomatal conductance gs and transpiration e were measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer irga li 6400 model li cor usa carried out on a fully expanded leaf from the same plagiotrophic branch used to measure the sap flow the measurements were performed from 08 00 to 10 00 a m and from 12 00 a m to 2 00 p m with an artificial light source led and photosynthetic photon flux adjusted to 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 during the evaluations the initial concentration of co2 in the chamber was kept at approximately 380 30 μmol mol 1 air temperature relative humidity inside the chamber and the leaf area used in the equipment were 30 1 0 15 c 61 0 13 and 6 cm² respectively daily average values for the daytime period 12 h interval from 6 00 a m to 6 00 p m for variables a gs or e zdx were obtained from the weighted average between the values of the measurements made from 08 00 to 10 00 a m and from 12 00 a m to 2 00 p m on the same day eq 2 2 z d x 3 z m o r n i n g 2 z a f t e r n o o m 6 where z m o r n i n g a or gs or e values measured from 8 00 to 10 00 a m z a f t e r n o o n a or gs or e values measured from 12 00 a m to 2 00 p m x varied from 1 to 8 as replications of each treatment and the numbers 3 2 and 6 are weighting factors that resulted from the following assumptions i the value of variables a gs or e increase linearly both from zero to z m o r n i n g values between 6 00 a m and 8 00 a m and from z m o r n i n g to z a f t e r n o o n values between 8 00 a m and 12 00 p m and ii the value of variables a gs or e between 12 00 a m to 4 00 p m and between 4 00 and 6 00 p m decrease linearly in a symmetrical form with the increment assumed in the morning period that is with the same slopes but with opposite signs 2 5 statistical analysis regression analysis to compare the actual output of the sensor and the reference evapotranspiration was carried to calibrate the sap flow sensors data processing and statistical analysis were carried out using the program r core team which calculated mean standard deviation and confidence interval α 5 for each variable analyzed 2 6 crop water stress index using the sap flow sensor cwsisapflow and the irga equipment cwsit the temperature variation produced by intermittent cycles of heating and cooling due to application of heat pulses in alternate intervals of 90 s of heating and 90 s of cooling was defined as measured variable of the sensor intermittent heating and cooling cycles occurred at regular intervals of three minutes eq 3 was used to determine the temperature variation δ t h the temperature values measured at 10 90 100 and 180 s after the start of heating supply 3 δ t h t 90 t 10 t 100 t 180 2 where δ t h temperature changes in the plant during the pulse t 10 temperature measured by the sensor 10 s after the start of the pulse t 90 temperature measured by the sensor 90 seconds after the start of the pulse t 100 temperature measured by the sensor 100 s after the start of the pulse and t 180 temperature measured by the sensor 180 s after the start of the pulse with the change in temperature the actual output of the sensor was defined λ eq 4 4 λ 1 δ t h δ t h 0 where λ sensor signal dimensionless δ t h 0 temperature range measured by the sensor installed on the plant at zero flow condition at night and δ t h temperature range measured by the sensor installed on the plant at one point in time during the day assuming a linear relationship between the signal measured by the sensor λ and sap flow the amount of sap flow can be estimated using eq 5 5 j k λ where j sap flow density m3 s 1 m 2 and k coefficient depending on the wood and sap thermal properties diffusivity and thermal capacity and the sensor geometry the current transpiration water loss by a plant through its leaves was estimated by eq 6 6 e l j s a l a o r e l k λ s a l a where e l transpiration per unit of leaf area m3 s 1 m 2 s a cross section of the branch where the sensor was installed m2 and l a leaf area above of the branch where the sensor was installed m2 relating the hourly average of the sensor signal λ with the hourly reference evapotranspiration eto under conditions that show no water stress to the plant that is a situation in which the water deficit is equal to zero d e f 0 and assuming a linear relationship between λ and eto eq 7 is obtained 7 λ d e f 0 a e t o where a is the slope coefficient adjusted by linear regression between the sensor signal and hourly reference evapotranspiration eto leaf potential transpiration e l ˆ for plants without water stress was estimated by eq 8 8 e l ˆ d e f 0 k a e t o s a l a d e f 0 therefore crop water stress index cwsisapflow was estimated by the ratio between the current transpiration and leaf potential transpiration by applying the previous equations eq 9 9 c w s i s a p f l o w 1 e l e l d e f 0 1 λ a e t o where e l the sum of daily transpiration of plant subject to water restrictions ni and t l d e f 0 the sum of daily transpiration of the plant without water restriction i therefore the crop water stress index can be estimated only with the sensor signal and its relationship to reference evapotranspiration when considering that the relationship between the cross section of the branch and the leaf area remains constant during the evaluation period for cwsisapflow validation a crop water stress index cwsit based on the daily actual plant transpiration values e obtained by the irga equipment was calculated using eq 10 10 c w s i x n i 1 e d x n i e m 1 e d x n i j 1 8 e d x i r 8 c w s i t j 1 8 c w s i x n i 8 where x varies from 1 to 8 according to the identification of each repetition each plant for each treatment c w s i x n i is the irga proposed stress index value for each plant each replication of the non irrigated treatment using the irga measurements e d x n i and e d x i r are the average daily transpiration values of each plant obtained by eq 2 from the irga measurements in non irrigated and irrigated treatments respectively and em is the daily transpiration mean value representing the irrigated treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluated variables for both the coffee water soil and plant status fig 3 and the physiological traits fig 4 a significant statistical difference is observed when the error bars that represent the standard deviations of the mean sdm for i and ni no longer overlap on the same date day after initiating treatment significant differences between values of soil moisture leaf water potential at pre dawn ψpd and at midday ψmd were detected for all evaluated cycles in which ni presented lower averages in comparison with i fig 3 periods of significant difference figs 3 and 4 indicate that the reduction of soil water content by evapotranspiration and water redistribution inside the soil especially for ni were enough to cause the distinction between the treatments with reestablishment of irrigation at the end of the 14th day of second cycle and 10th day of the third cycle soil moisture ψpd and ψmd showed no significant difference between treatments for the next date of evaluation fig 3 that is irrigation replenished the soil water lost by evapotranspiration eliminating the stress in the evaluated plant ψpd and ψmd values fig 3 from d to i reflected the decrease in soil moisture fig 3a c for ni reaching significantly negative values and ensuring the implementation of severe water stress for the treatment in question according to silva et al 2010 for a particular clone of conilon coffee ψpd of between 1 5 and 3 0 mpa causes moderate to severe water stress respectively by the time ni plants reached the maximum negative ψpd and ψmd no symptoms of leaf wilting were observed in any of the cycles conilon plants maintain high relative water content even at significantly negative leaf water potential visible symptoms of leaf wilting are rare because turgor loss point usually around 90 is related to high rigidity of cell walls presenting leaf water potential ranging from 1 7 to 2 2 mpa for irrigated clones and reaching more negative values for non irrigated clones damatta et al 1993 2002 pinheiro et al 2005 the greater dispersion of soil moisture for cycle 1 fig 3a influenced stomatal conductance transpiration and net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate during this cycle fig 4j m and p since they are directly dependent processes of soil water availability bergonci and pereira 2002 larcher 2004 andrade et al 2015 the significant difference between i and ni treatments figs 3 and 4 confirmed the water stress condition of the plant proposed by the present research but it did not quantify the level of stress being indicated to elaborate the cwsisapflow for this purpose based on the aforementioned stress condition for convenience and ease in automation 3 2 calibration of sap flow sensors the main objective achieved from the calibration of the sap flow sensor fig 5 was to determine the adjustment coefficient a of eq 6 for the continuity of the cwsisapflow elaboration process based on the subsequent equations the proposed sensor model showed good correlation with eto based on the coefficient of determination with satisfactory linear correlation fig 5 the results corroborate with the findings of conejero et al 2006 that after studying sap flow by a compensation heat pulse method in peach trees under water deficit and recovery from drought stress found linear correlation between sensor signal and eto with valued of r² equal to 0 77 the statistically significant linear relationship fig 5 obtained between the actual sensor signal λ and the reference evapotranspiration eto for the irrigated condition i confirmed the linearity condition of eq 6 allowing us to obtain the adjustment coefficient a of the same equation thus λ was only in function of eto as eto is directly related to plant transpiration eq 7 the cwsisapflow could be elaborated relating the current transpiration with maximum potential plant transpiration eq 8 for the cwsisapflow developed here the value 0 zero indicates absence of water stress and the value one 1 indicates maximum water stress in the present study for ni the cwsisapflow varied within the estimated range so that it is possible to identify water status of the plants with a statistically significant difference in relation to i treatment fig 6 it is important to emphasize that since the cwsisapflow is not an absolute value but a relation between the current transpiration measured indirectly by the sensor signal and the potential transpiration of the plant in question previously determined the plant water status can be identified only by the actual sensor signal λ received without the need to determine transpiration itself a more laborious and relatively expensive process this sap flow sensor estimated plant transpiration faster and cheaper than irga method infrared gas analyzer 3 3 proposed crop water stress index cwsisapflow variation of the cwsisapflow between zero no drought and 1 0 severe water stress in response to water stress ni and full irrigated conditions i is showed in fig 6 the statistical differentiation of cwsisapflow starts on the 6th day after initiation of the treatments for the first and third cycles and on the 11th day for second cycle fig 6 for ni after the application of the irrigation on the 15th and 10th days for the second and third cycles respectively days with cwsisapflow maximum values there was no significant difference between treatments agreeing with figs 3 and 4 the higher cwsisapflow variation of i treatment in the first cycle fig 6 is justified by the greater soil moisture variation presented for the same trait and the same cycle fig 3a represented by a higher standard deviation of the mean compared to soil moisture in the other two cycles the increase in cwsisapflow for i treatment on the 8th 12th and 14th day for the first cycle from the 10th and the 14th day for the second cycle and on the 8th and 12th day for the third cycle fig 6 suggests low sap flow related to low plant transpiration on the days in question what was to be expected then for the same period lower values of tmax and tmed fig 1 were observed low temperatures negatively affect stomatal conductance and transpiration praxedes et al 2006 partelli et al 2009 2010 2011a 2011b fernandes et al 2012 according to pimentel et al 2010 the sap flow decreases influenced by low temperatures and high relative humidity with correlation between variables with r² value of 0 6 and 0 7 respectively 3 4 cwsisapflow validation the cwsisapflow was compared to a cwsit calculated based on the measurement of the actual plant transpiration using irga equipment for ni treatment fig 7 for first and third cycles the cwsit presented significantly lower values for some dates in relation to the cwsisapflow fig 7 however for the second cycle throughout all the evaluation period there was no significant difference between cwsisapflow and cwsit low difference between the two coefficients of water stress fig 7 was observed both cwsisapflow and cwsit reflected the plant water status under conditions of low water availability values close up to 1 0 or in easily available water conditions values close to zero thus the sap flow sensor can be used to reliably determine the level of water stress of conilon coffee plants 3 5 relationship between evaluated variables and crop water stress index cwsisapflow fig 8 demonstrates the relationship between the evaluated variables and cwsisapflow besides indicating critical values of cwsisapflow from which the water stress condition started results obtained from the sap flow sensor fig 8 allow one to infer plant water condition considering the good correlation r2 0 75 between cwsisapflow and ψpd widely used as a crop water status indicator silva et al 2003 larcher 2004 fig 8 a and b presents data assessed during the conduction of cycles for i and at the beginning of each cycle for ni when the plants were not under influence of water stress it shows the wide variation in the values for cwsisapflow 0 0 and 0 5 low variation of ψpd 0 0 and 0 5 mpa and ψmd 0 5 and 1 3 mpa however for ni with the intense increase of water stress there was a decrease in the variation of cwsisapflow values from 0 6 to 0 9 and an increase in the variation of ψpd 0 6 to 2 3 mpa and ψmd 0 6 to 2 5 mpa the reduction of soil moisture fig 3 caused a decrease in the amount of water available for the plant fig 4 and a reduction in transpiration maestri and vieira 1958 tenhunen et al 1987 larcher 2004 this resulted in increase of cwsisapflow and decreased stomatal conductance gs values for ni plants fig 8d corroborating with damatta et al 2002 and silva et al 2010 cwsisapflow had a polynomial relationship with net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate a presenting relatively low rates of net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate for conilon coffee plants fig 8 compared to other woody species pinheiro et al 2004 2005 ronchi et al 2005 praxedes et al 2006 recording maximums values around 11 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 similar to andrade et al 2015 however for conilon coffee plants clone 12 v there was a variation in the net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate without water stress of between 7 73 and 12 24 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 which was higher than the values found in the literature water deficit in coffee causes a reduction in the net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate due to a reduction in stomatal conductance under water stress conditions the influx of co2 in the substomatal chamber is reduced due to stomatal closure or the direct effects of dehydration on the photochemical or biochemical reactions of photosynthesis andrade et al 2015 costa and marenco 2007 results observed for soil moisture ψpd ψmd fig 3 gs e and a fig 8d f during the evaluated cycles corroborate with above mentioned authors ni plants presented lower values of a in comparison to i plants in the same period in which gs was significantly lower as well according to cornic 2000 under moderate water stress conditions stomatal closure severely restricts net photosynthetic co2 assimilation so that stomatal control has been considered as the main limiting factor of net photosynthetic co2 assimilation araujo et al 2008 states that low photosynthetic rates in some woody species as coffea arabica can be attributed mainly to lower values of stomatal conductance silva et al 2010 verified a sharp reduction in stomatal conductance of conilon coffee plants under water deficit compared to a small reduction in the net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate it was also verified that stomatal closure caused proportionately greater decreases in transpiration than net photosynthetic co2 assimilation since instant water use efficiency a e increased under water stress conditions these data are indicative that the reduction of photosynthesis due to water stress was associated mainly to co2 diffusion limitations and not to biochemical limitations of the photochemical or biochemical reactions of photosynthesis damatta and ramalho 2006 during the beginning of each cycle the coffee plants had statistically equal values for soil moisture ψpd and ψmd gs e and a among the treatments fig 8 however with the worsening in water stress for the ni treatment decreases in the values of the variables in question was observed concomitant with increasing cwsisapflow the reduction on values of the abovementioned variables began with values of cwsisapflow between 0 4 and 0 6 which are suggested by the present study as critical values for cwsisapflow for conilon coffee plants clone 12 v in early stages of development subjected to water stress from june to september in the region studied here finally studies of irrigation management based on cwsisapflow are encouraged by the authors since as seen in the present study cwsisapflow values above 0 4 provide a significant drop in the processes of stomatal conductance transpiration and net photosynthetic co2 assimilation fig 8 initiating a water stress condition in the plant thus with the constant monitoring of the cwsisapflow variation using the sap flow sensor for a particular plant irrigation will be necessary whenever the cwsisapflow reaches the suggested critical value 0 4 for the crop in question there is also the possibility of automated irrigation based on the current sensor response to start water application automatically every time the sap sensor reading reaches a value corresponding to the critical value of cwsisapflow 4 conclusions the proposed sap flow sensor can be used for determining sap flow in young conilon coffee plants by measuring crop water stress index cwsisapflow and estimating crop water status more quickly and at lower cost than previous methods the cwsisapflow showed good correlation with the percentage of soil moisture leaf water potential stomatal conductance transpiration and net photosynthetic co2 assimilation of the conilon coffee plant clone studied here the present study suggests a critical value for cwsisapflow of 0 4 from which point conilon coffee plants suffer from water stress during the early stages of their development a critical value of crop water stress index cwsisapflow for conilon coffee plants allows the estimation with good precision of the critical time to start irrigation avoiding physiological damage to the plant the present work proposes a new methodology for estimating the cwsi with satisfactory applicability in automated irrigation management for coffee cultivation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

promoting sustainable agricultural 2 materials and methods 2 1 site experiments and cropping details the experiment was conducted in the greenhouse of the key laboratory of modern agricultural equipment and technology ministry of education jiangsu university zhenjiang china 119 45 e 32 20 n the soil of experimental site was predominant clay loam with low percentage of organic matter the

in greenhouse the experimental design was consisted of 9 treatments with 3 replications per treatment by considering two factors biochar and irrigation the experimental design is shown in the fig 1 biochar at different three levels b0 0 ton ha b1 25 tons ha and b2 50 tons ha along with three irrigation water requirement iwr levels full irrigation t1 1 4 pan evaporation ep moderate water deficit t2 1 2 ep and severe water deficit t3 1 0 ep were applied in greenhouse yan et al 2018 thus nine treatments i e t1b0 t1b1 t1b2 t2b0 t2b1 t2b2 t3b0 t3b1 and t3b2 were set moderate water deficit with no biochar application t2b0 was set as two factor control group with different irrigation and biochar application the irrigation amount applied during whole growing period was 481 97 mm 401 98 mm 328 75 mm for t1 t2 and t3 respectively the irrigation quantity treatments were assigned to main block and biochar treatments were allotted to troughs plots within the main blocks a nonperforated barriers were put between the plots to facilitate crop management practices and prevent lateral water movement within interface of plots 2 3 biochar properties and soil physical properties the biochar used in this experiment was purchased from sanli new energy company located in henan province china it was produced from wheat straw which was pyrolyzed in a vertical kiln made of refractory bricks at 350 550 the chemical properties of biochar are as follows ph is 10 35 soil organic carbon is 467 2 g kg 1 total n is 5 9 g kg 1 total p is 14 43 g kg 1 total k is 11 5 g kg 1 cation exchange capacity is 21 7 cmol kg 1 b ali et al 2018 a set of 27 soil samples were taken to measure the physical properties at depths of 10 cm from each plot by using an auger and composite at the period of seedling stage carry out the same sampling experiment in mature picking stage the bulk density soil porosity and three phase solid and liquid v composition were determined using the soil instrument dik 1150 japan to obtain the following parameters b d g c m 3 s 100 where bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 s is mass of soil solid weight g and 100 is volume of soil samples p 100 v s where p is soil porosity vs is solid volume ml v a 100 v v s w v d 1 v l v v s where va is air volume ml v is actual volume ml w is total weight g d is ture density g ml 1 vl is liquid volume ml 2 4 crop growth and yield parameters plant height cm from soil surface to plant top tip was measured after every 10 days during growth period the stem diameter mm was measured at marked point of 10 cm height from soil surface by vernier caliper after every 10 days during growth period the number of fruits per plant were counted for each treatment the yield of fresh fruit in terms of weight per plant g plant 1 was measured using sensitive weight balance at the end of harvesting the total fruits weight was summed up to accumulate the total yield t ha 1 for each treatment 2 5 fruit quality parameters to investigate quality of tomato three fruits per plant with similar size maturity and without any external defects were picked from each treatment tomato fruits were peeled off and blended afterwards the blended paste was squeezed with muslin cloth to extract juice as homogenized representative sample for each treatment individually total soluble solids tss brix were measured using a refractometer abbe wya 2s usa at 20 c ullah et al 2017 the total soluble sugar concentration tssc was measured using the method of anthrone colorimetric li 2000 total acidity ta percentage of citric acid was measured on homogenized samples by titration with 0 1 n naoh the content of vitamin c was determined by xylene extraction colorimetry 2 6 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted with spss 16 spss inc chicago il usa data were analyzed using the two way analysis of variance anova to investigate the combined effects of irrigation and biochar application amount of each treatment the least significant difference lsd test was employed to determine the significant differences between means at a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil physical properties the effects of different biochar and irrigation treatments on the soil bulk density at two different growing stages seedling and mature picking are shown in fig 2 the soil bulk density showed different trends at b0 b1 and b2 levels with respective to irrigation treatments t1 t2 and t3 in seedling stage as well as in mature picking stage it is found that increasing biochar level within the individual irrigation treatments t1 t2 and t3 bulk density showed decreasing trend the lowest soil bulk density was found 0 974 g cm 3 in t1b2 which is 14 79 less than ck t2b0 the effects of different levels of biochar and irrigation at seedling and mature picking stage on porosity are shown in fig 3 the result showed that at increasing irrigation amount the soil porosity responded different trends to b0 b1 and b2 the porosity showed increasing trend at increasing level of biochar in all three irrigation levels t1 t2 and t3 the highest value of soil porosity was found in t2b2 which increased by 10 53 as compared to ck according to the statistical analysis it was found that different amount of irrigation had no significant effect on the soil bulk density and soil porosity p 0 05 at the seeding and mature picking stage of tomato while biochar had a significant effect on the soil bulk density and the soil porosity p 0 05 however the interaction between irrigation and biochar has no significant effect on the soil bulk density and the soil porosity at the seedling stage according to the two way anova the above results confirmed that although irrigation had no significant effect on the soil bulk density the soil bulk density in the treatment with the largest amount of biochar application b2 still showed a greatest reduction under the interaction of irrigation and biochar soil bulk density and porosity are closely related to soil structure texture organic matter content and soil compactness at the same time these are also affected by agricultural practices such as fertilizer application irrigation drainage and agricultural tillage li et al 2018 it is reported that well structure soil has porosity range from 55 to 70 li et al 2018 li et al 2018 described that low value of soil bulk density less compacted soil texture larger soil porosity high water holding capacity and water conductivity could promote the growth and production of crops application of biochar reduce the bulk density and increase the porosity of soil because of its bulk density is lower than the soil biochar has high porosity which results from retaining the cell wall structure of the biomass feedstock therefore porous characteristics of applied biochar in soil increase the porosity and decrease the bulk density of soil agbna et al 2017a aruna et al 2020 the results of this experiment is consistent with the above described research results however jin et al 2018 found that irrigation had a significant p 0 05 effect on the soil porosity the inconsistency between the results of this experiment and their results may be due to the short research period of this experiment soil is a porous heterogeneous system consisted of 3 phase composition solid particles liquid and air the structure of soil depends upon the proportion of 3 phase of soil solid liquid and air soil 3 phase is an organic whole which is interrelated restrictive and inseparable and it is also the foundation of soil fertility 3 phase proportion of soil is affected by irrigation drainage fertilization and cultivation methods suitable irrigation system appropriate fertilization and proper cultivation methods are factors to optimize the soil three phase composition and improve soil physical properties in this way optimum yield can be achieved by improving soil physical health therefore economy of farmer community can be improved by getting optimum yield of crops the effects of different levels of biochar and irrigation quantity on soil 3 phase composition at the seedling and mature picking stage are shown in fig 4 the proportion of soil solid phase was found 40 and 37 01 at seedling and mature picking stage respectively and gas liquid phase was found 60 and 62 99 at the seedling and mature picking stage respectively under t2b0 treatment the proportion of soil solid phase was determined 33 68 and 33 82 at the seedling and mature picking stage respectively and gas liquid phase was obtained 66 32 and 66 18 at the seedling and mature picking stage respectively under t2b2 treatment it can be clearly seen that the percentage of solid phase decreased gradually with the increase in the biochar application under different irrigation levels while the proportion of common content in liquid and gas phase increased the order of soil solid fraction was ck t1b0 t3b0 t1b1 t3b1 t2b1 t3b2 t1b2 t2b2 at the seeding stage as compared to ck the percentage of soil solid phase decreased by 0 49 3 39 3 44 4 62 5 29 5 54 6 26 and 6 32 under t1b0 t3b0 t1b1 t3b1 t2b1 t3b2 t1b2 and t2b2 respectively it is cleared that when proportion of solid phase decreased the total proportion of gas and liquid phase increased therefore the above mentioned results showed that proportion of gas liquid phase increased gradually under different treatments li et al 2018 also found that biochar could effectively optimize the soil 3 phase composition improve the soil water holding capacity and increase the soil permeability 3 2 crop growth and yield parameters the influence of different levels of applied irrigation and biochar on the plant height stem diameter and yield of tomato are shown in table 2 the plant height responded positively with increasing trend at increasing rate of irrigation under different biochar application levels the plant height showed different responses by increasing the biochar application under irrigation quantity treatments plant height decreased initially and then increased slightly under t1 irrigation increased under t2 irrigation gradually increased in the beginning and then decreased under t3 irrigation the trend of stem diameter was found such like plant height trend under different treatments of applied biochar and irrigation quantity the yield of tomato under different amounts of biochar showed a significant increasing trend by increasing the irrigation volume p 0 05 different biochar application rates have different effects on the yield under different irrigation the yield was measured highest under t1b1 treatment which was 30 92 greater than the yield of b0 treatment the yield response was found 83 69 and 176 60 under t3b1 and t3b2 lager than the yield of b0 treatment respectively the maximum yield response was found under t1b2 treatment which was 631 15 higher than the control group which was 1 31 times more than that of t1b0 treatment the yield under t1b0 treatment was 11 73 times more than that of t3b0 treatment these results showed that the yield of tomato responded significantly under biochar application that was much more than the yield of no biochar application in greenhouse plant height and stem diameter was decreased significantly p 0 05 by decreasing of irrigation quantity biochar has no significant effect p 0 05 on plant height and stem diameter the effect of biochar on the height and stem diameter is much smaller than that of irrigation this shows that the amount of irrigation is the main factor affecting plant height and stem diameter under the combined application of irrigation and biochar which is much greater than the effect of biochar the combined effect two parameters have a very significant effect p 0 01 on the plant height and stem diameter biochar application has no significant effect on the yield but combined application of biochar and irrigation has a significant effect p 0 05 on greenhouse tomato yield the main indicators of crop growth are plant height and stem diameter the thick stems of plants reflect the vegetative level of crops hou et al 2016 it is reported by different studies that plant height and stem diameter increased significantly by increasing the rate of irrigation at different stages of tomato growth hou et al 2016 fei et al 2016 in this study different biochar application will have different degrees of influence on the growth of the plant height under full irrigation increased biochar application rate will promote the growth of plant height under moderate deficit of water there was no obvious effect under the heavy deficits this result is different from some existing studies li et al 2014 li et al 2018 concluded that the addition of biochar could significantly promote the growth of crops the plant heights of all biochar treatments were significantly different throughout the growth period and the increasing rate of stem diameter was found high under increasing rate of biochar application the difference between the results of the two studies may lie due to different irrigation mechanism agbna et al 2017b biochar and irrigation quantity treatments affected the crop growth at every developing stage of plant in different way and economic yield will ultimately be reflected in each treatment a lot of research results showed that different degrees of deficit of irrigation reduced the tomato yield from 15 52 to 51 99 as compared to full irrigation ullah et al 2017 chen et al 2018 in different studies there are certain differences in the impact of irrigation on the yield of tomato in this study the yield of greenhouse tomatoes increased with the increase of biochar application under t1 and t2 irrigation and decreased under t3 irrigation under the same treatment of each biochar application the tomato yield of t1 irrigation is much greater than that of t2 and t3 this is because the interaction of water and fertilizer has a significant impact on the yield when the amount of fertilizer was same the irrigation of t2 and t3 was relatively less than t1 which was not conducive to the absorption and utilization of nutrients for plants li et al 2014 unlike the results of this study agbna et al 2017 found that biochar improved the growth environment of tomatoes which significantly increased the fresh weight of plants at the end of maturity 3 3 fruit quality fruit quality nutrition flavor and appearance depends upon total soluble solids tss total soluble sugar concentration tssc and total acidity vitamin c vc is also play an important role as an antioxidant and main factor to characterize the nutritional quality of fruits all these parameters are determined to evaluate the fruit quality based on nutritional value commercially the effects of irrigation and biochar on fruit quality of tomato are shown in fig 5 it is found that at increasing rate of irrigation quantity the contents of tss tssc and ta decreased gradually under b0 b1 and b2 the maximum values of tss tssc and ta were found under t3b2 treatment which are 42 33 37 28 and 42 33 more than that values found under ck respectively tss tssc and ta showed increasing trend by applying more biochar at t2 and t3 irrigation levels akhtar et al 2014 but these showed different trends at t1 by applying more biochar it is found that the combined effect of designed biochar and irrigation quantity on the contents of tss tssc and ta was significant p 0 05 according to the variance analysis the differences among the three biochar treatments were not significant the effects of irrigation and biochar amount on tomato vc content are shown in fig 5 d results showed that at increasing rate of irrigation quantity regular pattern of vc content trends was not found under different biochar application it is observed that vc showed an obvious decline trend at t1 and t2 irrigation levels by increasing levels of biochar but it suddenly increased at t3 level especially in t3b2 the highest content was found 26 00 mg per 100 g of sample under t1b0 treatment which is 19 16 more than that of ck deficit irrigation reduced the total yield of tomato but increased the tss tssc ta and vc of tomato significantly different trends also indicate that the overall results of biochar on vc content are not found significant according to the two way anova irrigation quantity and biochar levels has no significant effect on the vc in this study the combined effect of irrigation and biochar is not found significant p 0 05 on the vc there are some deviations in the results of this study and related studies whether biochar has a significant impact on fruit quality or not zhang et al 2017 reported that tss and vc content showed increasing trend under water stress condition jin et al 2018 described that irrigation amount had significant p 0 01 effects on tss ta and vc of tomato fruit similarly chen et al 2013 found that tomato quality was sensitive to water deficit from flowering to fruit ripening stage akhtar et al 2014 found that biochar improved the quality of tomatoes under all irrigation treatments the results of this study show that that there was no significant difference in tss and vc p 0 322 by biochar application and the titratable acidity increased significantly after biochar treatment agbna et al 2017 found that vc increased significantly by adding biochar these deviations may be due to the diversity of the test methods and research backgrounds agbna et al 2017 concluded that irrigation and biochar treatment had significant p 0 01 effects on all fruit quality indices except soluble sugar 4 conclusion in this study 9 sets of treatments were designed under 3 irrigation quantity and 3 biochar application to investigate the effects of irrigation quantity and biochar application on the soil physical properties plant growth parameters fruit yield and quality of tomato in a greenhouse application of irrigation quantity had no significant effect on soil physical properties soil bulk density and porosity in a short period of time however increasing biochar application could significantly reduce soil bulk density and increase soil porosity furthermore the percentage of solid phase decreased gradually with the increase in biochar application due to increasing trend of porosity the combined effect of irrigation and biochar also has no significant effect on soil bulk density and porosity biochar could effectively reduce the soil bulk density increase porosity and the ratio of gas liquid consequently to enhance soil water holding capacity plant height and stem diameter are considered the growth parameters of crop the increasing irrigation quantity has significant effect on plant height and stem diameter consequently has significant effect on tomato yield while there is no considerable response of plant height stem diameter and yield to the application of biochar combined application of biochar and irrigation is found beneficial strategy to optimize the plant growth and fruit yield tss tssc and ta content are used fruit quality parameters commercially tss tssc and ta contents have been affected significantly by applying more irrigation although these quality parameters have positive correlations with the application of biochar but the response was not found significant vc contents are not responded with regular pattern to irrigation and biochar application declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

10492,considering the challenges faced by current agricultural industry such as less cultivable land lack of soil nutrient value limited water resources low yield and fruit quality appearance and nutritional values biochar application was found effective way to improve soil physical properties consequently yield and quality of tomatoes biochar at three levels b0 0 ton ha b1 25 tons ha and b2 50 tons ha with three levels of drip irrigation quantity full irrigation t1 1 4 pan evaporation ep moderate water deficit t2 1 2 ep and severe water deficit t3 1 0 ep were applied in greenhouse thus nine treatments i e t1b0 t1b1 t1b2 t2b0 t2b1 t2b2 t3b0 t3b1 and t3b2 were set the effects of applied different levels of irrigation quantity and biochar on soil physical properties crop growth yield and fruit quality were observed increasing level of applied irrigation quantity and biochar could improve the physical properties of soil effectively decreased increased and varied the soil bulk density porosity and 3 phase composition of soil respectively it is found that increasing levels of applied irrigation quantity at b2 had good effects on bulk density porosity and 3 phase proportion

increased by applying adequate level of irrigation quantity and biochar the yield was found maximum at t1b2 which was increased by 30 92 as compared to t1b0 for t3 level biochar application increased tomato yield as compared to b0 by 83 69 and 176 60 at b1 and b2 respectively it is concluded that application of biochar under full and severe deficit irrigation level increased tomato yield effectively but tomato growth could inhibit under moderate water deficit irrigation caused a slight yield reduction keywords irrigation biochar amendment soil physical properties tomato yield tomato

organic materials their relative amounts and formation process brady and weil 2002 it is claimed that soil bulk density of the tillage layer decreased significantly by biochar application for three years and gradually decreased to biochar increasing levels laird et al 2010 the presence of biochar in soil impact directly on soil physical characteristics and significant response to soil water retention which make soil environment feasible for soil preparation expansion shrinkage kinetics high permeability ability to retain cations and controlled soil temperature therefore biochar plays catalystic role to improve the soil health water use efficiency and fertilizer utilization downie et al 2009 munoo et al 2018 in addition biochar in soil also increased cation exchange capacity nutrient cycling adsorption phytonutrients ability to retain available water to plants and reduced nutrient leaching thus the nutrient and available water is used by plants efficiently consequently the response of crop growth and yield is significant cheng et al 2008 glaser et al 2001 liang et al 2006 akhtar et al 2014 reported that application of biochar in sandy loam soil under deficient irrigation increased the yield and quality of potted tomato several studies showed that good fruit quality was attained by applying biochar with managed deficit irrigation chen et al 2013 chen et al 2014 and tomato fruits were found to be sweeter and less acidic ripoll et al 2016 applying 1 3 to 2 3 of full irrigation with biochar during flowering fruit development and maturity stages increased total soluble solids significantly reduced sugar and vitamin c content fruit firmness sugar to acid ratio and fruit color index are found different chen et al 2013 liu et al 2019 research conducted by numerous scientist related to biochar application for the improvement of soil water relation and increment of crop production have achieved some oriented objectives therefore gap of knowledge will be filled to investigate the effect of application of biochar and water at different level on growth and physiological characteristics of greenhouse crops in order to investigate the effect of irrigation

promoting sustainable agricultural 2 materials and methods 2 1 site experiments and cropping details the experiment was conducted in the greenhouse of the key laboratory of modern agricultural equipment and technology ministry of education jiangsu university zhenjiang china 119 45 e 32 20 n the soil of experimental site was predominant clay loam with low percentage of organic matter the

t2 1 2 ep and severe water deficit t3 1 0 ep were applied in greenhouse yan et al 2018 thus nine treatments i e t1b0 t1b1 t1b2 t2b0 t2b1 t2b2 t3b0 t3b1 and t3b2 were set moderate water deficit with no biochar application t2b0 was set as two factor control group with different irrigation and biochar application the irrigation amount applied during whole growing period was 481 97 mm 401 98 mm 328 75 mm for t1 t2 and t3 respectively the irrigation quantity treatments were assigned to main block and biochar treatments were allotted to troughs plots within the main blocks a nonperforated barriers were put between the plots to facilitate crop management practices and prevent lateral water movement within interface of plots 2 3 biochar properties and soil physical properties the biochar used in this experiment was purchased from sanli new energy company located in henan province china it was produced from wheat straw which was pyrolyzed in a vertical kiln made of refractory bricks at 350 550 the chemical properties of biochar are as follows ph is 10 35 soil organic carbon is 467 2 g kg 1 total n is 5 9 g kg 1 total p is 14 43 g kg 1 total k is 11 5 g kg 1 cation exchange capacity is 21 7 cmol kg 1 b ali et al 2018 a set of 27 soil samples were taken to measure the physical properties at depths of 10 cm from each plot by using an auger and composite at the period of seedling stage carry out the same sampling experiment in mature picking stage the bulk density soil porosity and three phase solid and liquid v composition were determined using the soil instrument dik 1150 japan to obtain the following parameters b d g c m 3 s 100 where bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 s is mass of soil solid weight g and 100 is volume of soil samples p 100 v s where p is soil porosity vs is solid volume ml v a 100 v v s w v d 1 v l v v s where va is air volume ml v is actual volume ml w is total weight g d is ture density g ml 1 vl is liquid volume ml 2 4 crop growth and yield parameters plant height cm from soil surface to plant top tip was measured after every 10 days during growth period the stem diameter mm was measured at marked point of 10 cm height from soil surface by vernier caliper after every 10 days during growth period the number of fruits per plant were counted for each treatment the yield of fresh fruit in terms of weight per plant g plant 1 was measured using sensitive weight balance at the end of harvesting the total fruits weight was summed up to accumulate the total yield t ha 1 for each treatment 2 5 fruit quality parameters to investigate quality of tomato three fruits per plant with similar size maturity and without any external defects were picked from each treatment tomato fruits were peeled off and blended afterwards the blended paste was squeezed with muslin cloth to extract juice as homogenized representative sample for each treatment individually total soluble solids tss brix were measured using a refractometer abbe wya 2s usa at 20 c ullah et al 2017 the total soluble sugar concentration tssc was measured using the method of anthrone colorimetric li 2000 total acidity ta percentage of citric acid was measured on homogenized samples by titration with 0 1 n naoh the content of vitamin c was determined by xylene extraction colorimetry 2 6 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted with spss 16 spss inc chicago il usa data were analyzed using the two way analysis of variance anova to investigate the combined effects of irrigation and biochar application amount of each treatment the least significant difference lsd test was employed to determine the significant differences between means at a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil physical properties the effects of different biochar and irrigation treatments on the soil bulk density at two different growing stages seedling and mature picking are shown in fig 2 the soil bulk density showed different trends at b0 b1 and b2 levels with respective to irrigation treatments t1 t2 and t3 in seedling stage as well as in mature picking stage it is found that increasing biochar level within the individual irrigation treatments t1 t2 and t3 bulk density showed decreasing trend the lowest soil bulk density was found 0 974 g cm 3 in t1b2 which is 14 79 less than ck t2b0 the effects of different levels of biochar and irrigation at seedling and mature picking stage on porosity are shown in fig 3 the result showed that at increasing irrigation amount the soil porosity responded different trends to b0 b1 and b2 the porosity showed increasing trend at increasing level of biochar in all three irrigation levels t1 t2 and t3 the highest value of soil porosity was found in t2b2 which increased by 10 53 as compared to ck according to the statistical analysis it was found that different amount of irrigation had no significant effect on the soil bulk density and soil porosity p 0 05 at the seeding and mature picking stage of tomato while biochar had a significant effect on the soil bulk density and the soil porosity p 0 05 however the interaction between irrigation and biochar has no significant effect on the soil bulk density and the soil porosity at the seedling stage according to the two way anova the above results confirmed that although irrigation had no significant effect on the soil bulk density the soil bulk density in the treatment with the largest amount of biochar application b2 still showed a greatest reduction under the interaction of irrigation and biochar soil bulk density and porosity are closely related to soil structure texture organic matter content and soil compactness at the same time these are also affected by agricultural practices such as fertilizer application irrigation drainage and agricultural tillage li et al 2018 it is reported that well structure soil has porosity range from 55 to 70 li et al 2018 li et al 2018 described that low value of soil bulk density less compacted soil texture larger soil porosity high water holding capacity and water conductivity could promote the growth and production of crops application of biochar reduce the bulk density and increase the porosity of soil because of its bulk density is lower than the soil biochar has high porosity which results from retaining the cell wall structure of the biomass feedstock therefore porous characteristics of applied biochar in soil increase the porosity and decrease the bulk density of soil agbna et al 2017a aruna et al 2020 the results of this experiment is consistent with the above described research results however jin et al 2018 found that irrigation had a significant p 0 05 effect on the soil porosity the inconsistency between the results of this experiment and their results may be due to the short research period of this experiment soil is a porous heterogeneous system consisted of 3 phase composition solid particles liquid and air the structure of soil depends upon the proportion of 3 phase of soil solid liquid and air soil 3 phase is an organic whole which is interrelated restrictive and inseparable and it is also the foundation of soil fertility 3 phase proportion of soil is affected by irrigation drainage fertilization and cultivation methods suitable irrigation system appropriate fertilization and proper cultivation methods are factors to optimize the soil three phase composition and improve soil physical properties in this way optimum yield can be achieved by improving soil physical health therefore economy of farmer community can be improved by getting optimum yield of crops the effects of different levels of biochar and irrigation quantity on soil 3 phase composition at the seedling and mature picking stage are shown in fig 4 the proportion of soil solid phase was found 40 and 37 01 at seedling and mature picking stage respectively and gas liquid phase was found 60 and 62 99 at the seedling and mature picking stage respectively under t2b0 treatment the proportion of soil solid phase was determined 33 68 and 33 82 at the seedling and mature picking stage respectively and gas liquid phase was obtained 66 32 and 66 18 at the seedling and mature picking stage respectively under t2b2 treatment it can be clearly seen that the percentage of solid phase decreased gradually with the increase in the biochar application under different irrigation levels while the proportion of common content in liquid and gas phase increased the order of soil solid fraction was ck t1b0 t3b0 t1b1 t3b1 t2b1 t3b2 t1b2 t2b2 at the seeding stage as compared to ck the percentage of soil solid phase decreased by 0 49 3 39 3 44 4 62 5 29 5 54 6 26 and 6 32 under t1b0 t3b0 t1b1 t3b1 t2b1 t3b2 t1b2 and t2b2 respectively it is cleared that when proportion of solid phase decreased the total proportion of gas and liquid phase increased therefore the above mentioned results showed that proportion of gas liquid phase increased gradually under different treatments li et al 2018 also found that biochar could effectively optimize the soil 3 phase composition improve the soil water holding capacity and increase the soil permeability 3 2 crop growth and yield parameters the influence of different levels of applied irrigation and biochar on the plant height stem diameter and yield of tomato are shown in table 2 the plant height responded positively with increasing trend at increasing rate of irrigation under different biochar application levels the plant height showed different responses by increasing the biochar application under irrigation quantity treatments plant height decreased initially and then increased slightly under t1 irrigation increased under t2 irrigation gradually increased in the beginning and then decreased under t3 irrigation the trend of stem diameter was found such like plant height trend under different treatments of applied biochar and irrigation quantity the yield of tomato under different amounts of biochar showed a significant increasing trend by increasing the irrigation volume p 0 05 different biochar application rates have different effects on the yield under different irrigation the yield was measured highest under t1b1 treatment which was 30 92 greater than the yield of b0 treatment the yield response was found 83 69 and 176 60 under t3b1 and t3b2 lager than the yield of b0 treatment respectively the maximum yield response was found under t1b2 treatment which was 631 15 higher than the control group which was 1 31 times more than that of t1b0 treatment the yield under t1b0 treatment was 11 73 times more than that of t3b0 treatment these results showed that the yield of tomato responded significantly under biochar application that was much more than the yield of no biochar application in greenhouse plant height and stem diameter was decreased significantly p 0 05 by decreasing of irrigation quantity biochar has no significant effect p 0 05 on plant height and stem diameter the effect of biochar on the height and stem diameter is much smaller than that of irrigation this shows that the amount of irrigation is the main factor affecting plant height and stem diameter under the combined application of irrigation and biochar which is much greater than the effect of biochar the combined effect two parameters have a very significant effect p 0 01 on the plant height and stem diameter biochar application has no significant effect on the yield but combined application of biochar and irrigation has a significant effect p 0 05 on greenhouse tomato yield the main indicators of crop growth are plant height and stem diameter the thick stems of plants reflect the vegetative level of crops hou et al 2016 it is reported by different studies that plant height and stem diameter increased significantly by increasing the rate of irrigation at different stages of tomato growth hou et al 2016 fei et al 2016 in this study different biochar application will have different degrees of influence on the growth of the plant height under full irrigation increased biochar application rate will promote the growth of plant height under moderate deficit of water there was no obvious effect under the heavy deficits this result is different from some existing studies li et al 2014 li et al 2018 concluded that the addition of biochar could significantly promote the growth of crops the plant heights of all biochar treatments were significantly different throughout the growth period and the increasing rate of stem diameter was found high under increasing rate of biochar application the difference between the results of the two studies may lie due to different irrigation mechanism agbna et al 2017b biochar and irrigation quantity treatments affected the crop growth at every developing stage of plant in different way and economic yield will ultimately be reflected in each treatment a lot of research results showed that different degrees of deficit of irrigation reduced the tomato yield from 15 52 to 51 99 as compared to full irrigation ullah et al 2017 chen et al 2018 in different studies there are certain differences in the impact of irrigation on the yield of tomato in this study the yield of greenhouse tomatoes increased with the increase of biochar application under t1 and t2 irrigation and decreased under t3 irrigation under the same treatment of each biochar application the tomato yield of t1 irrigation is much greater than that of t2 and t3 this is because the interaction of water and fertilizer has a significant impact on the yield when the amount of fertilizer was same the irrigation of t2 and t3 was relatively less than t1 which was not conducive to the absorption and utilization of nutrients for plants li et al 2014 unlike the results of this study agbna et al 2017 found that biochar improved the growth environment of tomatoes which significantly increased the fresh weight of plants at the end of maturity 3 3 fruit quality fruit quality nutrition flavor and appearance depends upon total soluble solids tss total soluble sugar concentration tssc and total acidity vitamin c vc is also play an important role as an antioxidant and main factor to characterize the nutritional quality of fruits all these parameters are determined to evaluate the fruit quality based on nutritional value commercially the effects of irrigation and biochar on fruit quality of tomato are shown in fig 5 it is found that at increasing rate of irrigation quantity the contents of tss tssc and ta decreased gradually under b0 b1 and b2 the maximum values of tss tssc and ta were found under t3b2 treatment which are 42 33 37 28 and 42 33 more than that values found under ck respectively tss tssc and ta showed increasing trend by applying more biochar at t2 and t3 irrigation levels akhtar et al 2014 but these showed different trends at t1 by applying more biochar it is found that the combined effect of designed biochar and irrigation quantity on the contents of tss tssc and ta was significant p 0 05 according to the variance analysis the differences among the three biochar treatments were not significant the effects of irrigation and biochar amount on tomato vc content are shown in fig 5 d results showed that at increasing rate of irrigation quantity regular pattern of vc content trends was not found under different biochar application it is observed that vc showed an obvious decline trend at t1 and t2 irrigation levels by increasing levels of biochar but it suddenly increased at t3 level especially in t3b2 the highest content was found 26 00 mg per 100 g of sample under t1b0 treatment which is 19 16 more than that of ck deficit irrigation reduced the total yield of tomato but increased the tss tssc ta and vc of tomato significantly different trends also indicate that the overall results of biochar on vc content are not found significant according to the two way anova irrigation quantity and biochar levels has no significant effect on the vc in this study the combined effect of irrigation and biochar is not found significant p 0 05 on the vc there are some deviations in the results of this study and related studies whether biochar has a significant impact on fruit quality or not zhang et al 2017 reported that tss and vc content showed increasing trend under water stress condition jin et al 2018 described that irrigation amount had significant p 0 01 effects on tss ta and vc of tomato fruit similarly chen et al 2013 found that tomato quality was sensitive to water deficit from flowering to fruit ripening stage akhtar et al 2014 found that biochar improved the quality of tomatoes under all irrigation treatments the results of this study show that that there was no significant difference in tss and vc p 0 322 by biochar application and the titratable acidity increased significantly after biochar treatment agbna et al 2017 found that vc increased significantly by adding biochar these deviations may be due to the diversity of the test methods and research backgrounds agbna et al 2017 concluded that irrigation and biochar treatment had significant p 0 01 effects on all fruit quality indices except soluble sugar 4 conclusion in this study 9 sets of treatments were designed under 3 irrigation quantity and 3 biochar application to investigate the effects of irrigation quantity and biochar application on the soil physical properties plant growth parameters fruit yield and quality of tomato in a greenhouse application of irrigation quantity had no significant effect on soil physical properties soil bulk density and porosity in a short period of time however increasing biochar application could significantly reduce soil bulk density and increase soil porosity furthermore the percentage of solid phase decreased gradually with the increase in biochar application due to increasing trend of porosity the combined effect of irrigation and biochar also has no significant effect on soil bulk density and porosity biochar could effectively reduce the soil bulk density increase porosity and the ratio of gas liquid consequently to enhance soil water holding capacity plant height and stem diameter are considered the growth parameters of crop the increasing irrigation quantity has significant effect on plant height and stem diameter consequently has significant effect on tomato yield while there is no considerable response of plant height stem diameter and yield to the application of biochar combined application of biochar and irrigation is found beneficial strategy to optimize the plant growth and fruit yield tss tssc and ta content are used fruit quality parameters commercially tss tssc and ta contents have been affected significantly by applying more irrigation although these quality parameters have positive correlations with the application of biochar but the response was not found significant vc contents are not responded with regular pattern to irrigation and biochar application declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

10493,pre planting soil moisture plays an important role in regulating plant emergence rate and yield yet there is a paucity of studies on the response of cotton growth and yield to pre planting soil moisture in arid regions in this study the cropgro cotton model was used to simulate cotton growth and yield in a mulched drip irrigation system with the interaction of different pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels during the cotton growing season this was undertaken to determine the optimal pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels that would produce the highest cotton yield and biomass values in the model simulations experimental data of cotton phenology and the biomass and yield at the maturing stage in 2017 and 2018 was used to calibrate and verify the dssat cropgro cotton model outputs based on the calibrated cropgro cotton model scenario simulation was performed using three irrigation levels 24 mm 30 mm 36 mm and eight pre planting soil water contents 1 2 θfc 1 1 θfc θfc field water holding capacity 0 9 θfc 0 8 θfc 0 7 θfc 0 6 θfc and 0 5 θfc the results showed that the simulated cotton phenology and seed cotton yield produced by the calibrated cropgro cotton model showed good fits with the observed values thus satisfying the accuracy requirement for large scale mulched drip irrigated cotton field simulations however large deviations were observed between simulated and observed biomass values according to the simulations the maximum seed cotton yield and biomass can be obtained from a pre planting soil water content of 0 8 θfc θfc and the maintenance of irrigation levels at 30 36 mm during the cotton growing season these simulation results may serve as reference data for cotton crop production and irrigation management in the tarim basin keywords cotton yield cropgro cotton model irrigation levels mulched drip irrigation pre planting soil moisture 1 introduction the tarim basin is located to the south of the tian shan mountain range with its ample heat and sunshine the tarim basin offers very suitable conditions for the cultivation of cotton crops in 2018 the total cotton cultivation area in the tarim basin covered approximately 1 32 million ha2 accounting for 63 of all cotton cultivation areas in xinjiang the tarim basin region is a typical oasis irrigation area with agricultural irrigation accounting for approximately 90 of the total water consumption specifically the cotton cultivation process faces problems such as low utilisation efficiency of irrigation water and severe wastage of water resources optimisation of the irrigation system in this region may effectively reduce the water demands of cotton production and increase water use efficiency currently the methods used to optimise cotton irrigation systems mainly involve field irrigation experiments however these experiments require a long period of time to complete and can be labour intensive the results can also be affected by many different factors which may require an array of trials that may use different measuring standards furthermore different outcomes can be obtained from trials conducted in different locations therefore it is important to explore a more convenient and effective method for the guidance of cotton production practices in the tarim basin in recent years crop growth models have been widely used to simulate crop growth and development formulate irrigation systems and investigate water and fertiliser coupling crop growth models are able to quantitatively and dynamically describe the growth development and yield formation of crops and their impact on the environment crop growth models are systematic predictive mechanistic and versatile they are also less labour intensive and require fewer material resources to implement compared with field experiments the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat models are currently among the most widely used crop models gijsman et al 2002 jones et al 2003 and encompass many well known models such as ceres crop environment resource synthesis and cropgro crop growth within the dssat platform the cropgro cotton model developed specifically for cotton has been extensively studied in many locations worldwide rinaldi 2004 ortiz et al 2009 thorp et al 2014 modala et al 2015 soler and hoogenboom 2006 reported that the cropgro cotton model is an effective tool for simulating different irrigation strategies because it is able to accurately predict the cotton phenology stages and crop yield rahman et al 2017 believed that this model can evaluate potential strategies to support decision making in cotton management practices including the determination of the optimal planting date in addition when simulating the interactions of different nitrogen application and planting dates the cropgro cotton model can better simulate the cotton phenology stages leaf area index crop yield as well as the long term temporal distribution of cotton yield and the marginal value per unit of water over seasonal evapotranspiration and different irrigation levels cammarano et al 2012 wajid et al 2014 adhikari et al 2017 this model also demonstrated that the employment of deficit irrigation practices under normal weather conditions can conserve water without adversely affecting seed cotton yields however under drought conditions the risk of increased yield loss should be considered when adopting deficit irrigation strategies modala et al 2015 amin et al 2017 estimated the optimal phosphorus application using the dssat csm cropgro cotton model for two cotton cultivars grown during 2013 2014 and the simulations were fairly consistent with the observations wu et al 2015 applied two methods to perform sensitivity analyses on the parameters of the cropgro cotton model model verification and evaluation of the calibrated parameters was also performed using a simulation of three different irrigation levels with respect to days of initial flowering and maturing seed cotton yield aboveground dry biomass maximum leaf area index and evapotranspiration the impacts of the input parameters were also verified and evaluated zheng 2018 estimated the effects of different nitrogen applications on cotton crop yield using the dssat model and evaluated the accuracy and applicability of using the dssat model to simulate cotton production under nitrogen limiting conditions collectively these studies demonstrated the extensive use of the cropgro cotton model for the simulation and application of cotton growth under different conditions as well as its good results factors affecting cotton production in the tarim basin include different irrigation approaches irrigation levels during the growing season and fertiliser applications in addition the emergence rate of cotton which in turn is largely affected by the pre planting soil moisture also contributes significantly to crop yield the pre planting irrigation in spring is required for high emergence rate of seeds in local cotton production however the influence of different pre planting soil water contents on the emergence rate of cotton seeds and cotton growth was seldom studied especially with the scenario simulation therefore in this study the cropgro cotton model was used to simulate the growth and yield of cotton in a mulched drip irrigation system under the influence of different pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels with the aim of obtaining the highest cotton yield and biomass while also determining the optimal pre planting soil moisture and irrigation level for cotton fields the results provide reference data which can be used to improve the cotton emergence rate decrease the pre planting irrigation levels in spring reduce the wastage of water and formulate rational spring irrigation strategies for cotton 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was performed in 2017 2018 at the soil and

experimental data were entered into the dssat model using the experimental data utility leaf area was measured once every 15 days after the cotton started to bud three representative cotton plants were chosen and marked in each plot the lengths and maximal widths of the leaves on the marked cotton plants were measured using a ruler and their leaf areas were calculated using the formula single leaf area cm2 length width 0 75 the total leaf area for each individual cotton plant was obtained by summing all of the single leaf areas cotton biomass was measured once every 15 days after the plants started to bud three representative cotton plants were chosen from each plot the whole plant was divided into roots stems leaves and buds and the different plant parts were then heated in an oven at 105 c for 30 min dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed cotton production was measured during the boll opening stage once 90 of the bolls had opened three sampling grids of 2 33 m 2 m were set out in each of the nine plots along which 100 bolls were picked and weighed the number of bolls and seed cotton yield per plant were also recorded 2 3 5 determination of soil water content soil moisture temperature and conductivity were monitored using 5te sensors meter pullman wa usa installed in the wide cotton row 30 cm away from the cotton plants for each plot and the data were recorded automatically using em50 data loggers meter pullman wa usa at 1 h intervals the sensors were buried at soil depths of 10 20 40 60 and 80 cm in addition soil water content was determined gravimetrically by comparing the wet and dry weights of soil samples collected at the end of every cotton growing stage to calibrate the sensors 3 dssat cropgro cotton model calibration and application because there is no mulch module in the cropgro cotton model the model cannot simulate the effects of plastic film mulch on the soil plant system in consideration of this limitation of the dssat cropgro cotton model we modified the potential evapotranspiration model and the extinction coefficient of evaporation process according to li et al 2019 as follows 1 the potential evapotranspiration was calculated by the penmen monteith p m method the default method in the cropgro cotton model is the priestley taylor p t model the climate of southern xinjiang is characterised by windy a long light period and low humidity which significantly affect plant growth the wind speed and relative humidity were considered in the p m model but not in the p t model the calculation procedure of p t model was described in the fao 56 allen et al 1998 2 plastic film mulch impacts soil surface temperature moisture and radiation yang et al 2015 sau et al 2004 and li et al 2019 reported that the accuracy of the potential evapotranspiration calculation was improved by changing the default extinction coefficient from 0 85 to 0 5 the average extinction coefficient of par for cotton was 0 57 which was measured in the 2019 season with li 190 sa and li 191 sa quantum sensors li cor inc lincoln ne usa according to the method of goudriaan 1977 the extinction coefficient of solar radiation was 0 47 which was used in the model the film ratio in this study was 0 80 which was used to improve soil evaporation calculation 3 the measured values of soil moisture before planting were input into the model the emergence rate was modified according to the measured value after the emergence of cotton 3 1 model parameterisation and evaluation genetic coefficient parameterisation was performed using the glue generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation genetic coefficient estimator which is included in the dssat platform experimental data from 2017 were chosen for parameter calibration while data from 2018 were used for model verification and evaluation various statistical analysis methods including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse normalised root mean square error nrmse and absolute relative error are were used as the evaluation indices for model calibration and to verify the reliability of the results the formulae used are as follows 1 are s i o i o i 100 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 4 nrmse rmse o 100 where si and oi are the simulated values and observed values respectively o is the mean observed value s o is the mean simulated value and n is the sample size 3 2 calibration of the cultivar parameters in the model for the localised application of the cropgro cotton model the genetic coefficient must first be determined which requires the calibration of the cultivar parameters in the model based on the 2017 experimental data from the three irrigation levels the cotton phenology flowering stage and maturing stage total biomass aboveground at harvest and seed cotton yield were used as the output variables for model parameter calibration the parameter optimisation criterion involved minimising the ares of these output variables to determine the cultivar parameters as shown in table 3 3 3 verification and evaluation of the model after parameterisation the optimal cultivar parameters were input into the model and the resultant cotton phenology yield and biomass were verified as shown in table 4 calibration of the model using the 2017 experimental data resulted in a good fit between the simulated and observed results ares between the simulated and observed flowering stage maturing stage biomass and seed cotton yield were 0 2 74 10 97 and 9 02 respectively which indicated that the model had good simulation effects for the flowering stage maturing stage and seed cotton yield data however biomass showed a significant deviation between the simulated and observed values model verification using the 2018 experimental data revealed a goof fit between the simulated and observed flowering stage maturing stage and seed cotton yield data with all ares 10 when the irrigation level was 30 mm during the cotton growing phase this indicated that these variables could accurately reflect the effects of different irrigation strategies on cotton phenology and seed cotton yield however model simulated biomass data deviated greatly from observed values the accuracy of cotton growth and yield data simulated by the cropgro cotton model was further evaluated using other statistical parameters table 5 model accuracy for the simulated seasonal phenology of 2017 and 2018 was relatively high with both nrmse 10 for the predicted seed cotton yield nrmse for 2017 and 2018 was 15 while the r2 values were 0 58 and 0 9 respectively indicating that the model was able to accurately simulate the seed cotton yield however the nrmse for cotton aboveground biomass was low in 2017 with r2 0 5 whereas in 2018 the nrmse was 30 with r2 close to 1 these differences indicated that the model was not able to accurately simulate cotton biomass possibly due to the local field management practices of topping and pruning in the cotton fields collectively the results indicated that the cropgro cotton model can satisfactorily simulate cotton phenology and seed cotton yield and can be used as a guide for cotton crop production and irrigation management in the tarim basin fig 1 table 6 3 4 application of the dssat cropgro cotton model simulation 3 4 1 scenario settings for pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels pre planting soil water content is an important factor that affects cotton emergence growth and yield it is important to establish a suitable pre planting irrigation strategy to ensure sufficient soil moisture for cotton germination therefore the calibrated dssat cropgro cotton model was used in this study to simulate the cotton biomass and seed cotton yield under different conditions of pre planting soil moisture and irrigation levels these simulations could enable the determination of suitable pre planting soil water contents for sowing cotton seeds and thus provide a theoretical basis for spring irrigation strategies in cotton fields a total of eight simulation scenarios for pre planting soil water contents were selected 1 2θfc 1 1θfc θfc field capacity 0 9θfc 0 8θfc 0 7θfc 0 6θfc and 0 5θfc based on the results of the 2017 and 2018 seasons three different irrigation levels 24 mm 30 mm and 36 mm were selected for each scenario during the cotton growing seasun with the depth of the wet layer being 30 cm based on our previous experiment of seed germination the emergence rate was 23 seeds m 2 for the pre planting soil moisture of 1 2θfc 0 8θfc 22 seeds m 2 for the pre planting soil moisture of 0 7θfc 19 seeds m 2 for the pre planting soil moisture of 0 6θfc 16 seeds m 2 for the pre planting soil moisture of 0 6θfc respectively determination of the irrigation schedule during the growing phase was based on the cotton experiments in 2017 and 2018 table 7 3 4 2 prediction of cotton yield and biomass for different pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels figs 2 and 3 show the seed cotton yield and biomass estimations of the calibrated dssat cropgro cotton model under different irrigation levels and pre planting soil water contents the simulation results showed that the seed cotton yield was the highest at an irrigation level of 24 mm and when the pre planting soil water content was equal to the θfc the seed cotton yield did not increase in scenarios with higher soil water contents but the seed cotton yield did decrease significantly as the pre planting soil moisture decreased the simulated values of biomass also showed similar change trends at an irrigation level of 30 mm the difference in seed cotton yield among pre planting soil water contents of 1 2θfc 1 1θfc and θfc was relatively small whereas the yield was reduced by 3 25 and 7 56 for soil water contents of 0 9θfc and 0 8θfc respectively compared to θfc and the drop in seed cotton yield was even more significant for scenarios with lower soil water contents the simulation indicated higher cotton biomass values for pre planting soil water contents of 0 9 θfc and 0 8 θfc than soil moisture of 1 2 θfc 1 1 θfc and θfc and the lowest biomass values for 0 6 θfc and 0 5 θfc at an irrigation level of 36 mm the seed cotton yield was increased by 0 21 and 0 33 for pre planting soil water contents of 1 2 θfc and 1 1 θfc respectively when compared to θfc whereas the yield only decreased by 0 09 0 85 and 3 83 for soil water contents of 0 9 θfc 0 8 θfc and 0 7 θfc respectively the decrease in seed cotton yield was more significant in scenarios with 0 6 θfc and 0 5 θfc the simulated and observed values of cotton biomass showed similar change trends 4 discussion in this study the dssat cropgro cotton model was calibrated and verified using cotton phenology biomass and yield data at the maturing stage collected during the 2017 and 2018 experiments in the tarim basin as there is no mulch module in the dssat cropgro cotton model the model was modified according to the suggestion of li et al 2019 li et al 2019 indicated that the performance of the dssat cropgro cotton model would be improved by modifying the potential evapotranspiration method and the extinction coefficients of the soil evaporation process the cropgro model cannot simulate soil salt dynamics however based on the results from the 2017 2018 seasons the ec value in 0 30 cm soil layer from sowing to early budding stage was lower than 350 μs cm 1 which has little impacts on cotton germination and growth after the early budding stage although the increase in air temperature induced high evaporation rates the ec value in 0 30 cm soil depth was lower than 1 ms cm 1 as the plots were irrigated every 7 10 days there was no significant accumulation of salt in the topsoil therefore only soil moisture was simulated by the cropgro model the simulated and observed values of several indicators showed a good fit with the exception of biomass which showed significant deviations between simulated and observed values the calibrated model was verified using the experimental data from 2018 at irrigation levels of 30 mm the simulated and observed flowering stage maturing stage and seed cotton yield data showed a good fit to further test the simulation accuracy of seed cotton yield and phenology nrmse and r2 were employed to statistically analyse the results statistical analysis showed that the calibrated model was able to accurately simulate seed cotton yield and phenology in the tarim basin wajid et al 2014 also reported that the total dry matter of cotton and seed cotton yield simulated by the dssat model was relatively accurate however due to the local field management practices of topping and pruning in cotton fields the simulation of cotton biomass was unsatisfactory in the present study parameters relevant to such agronomic practices are also missing in the dssat cropgro cotton model future studies and further calibration of the model should therefore consider the effects of different field management practices spring irrigation before cultivation is a routine practice in cotton crop production in the tarim basin region to increase soil moisture in general cases this involves a once off pre planting irrigation at levels of 3750 4500 m3 ha 2 however this practice can lead to farmland drainage and severe water wastage under the same field management practices cotton emergence rate is significantly affected by the pre planting soil water content such that the emergence rate would decrease if the soil water content is too high or too low which in turn is unfavourable for the subsequent cotton yield therefore the simulation process should consider the effect of pre planting soil water content the optimal pre planting soil water content obtained from the simulation results can serve as the theoretical basis for the determination of a suitable spring irrigation level existing simulation studies using the dssat cropgro cotton model have focused more on the simulation of cotton phenology growth and production under different irrigation methods irrigation levels and fertiliser applications cammarano et al 2012 wu et al 2015 adhikari et al 2017 rahman et al 2017 amin et al 2017 zheng 2018 while less attention is paid to pre planting soil moisture cotton emergence or even pre planting spring irrigation levels therefore this study used the calibrated dssat cropgro cotton model to simulate cotton yield and biomass under the interaction of different pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels during the cotton growing season the experiment was conducted in a saline alkali soil with average value of electrical conductivity of 600 μs cm 1 although the salt content in the soil was low salinity stress for cotton growth and yield formation would be limited as salt accumulation on the soil surface was induced by high evaporation especially in the seed gemination and budding stage in order to mitigate the negative effects of salinity on germination soil moisture levels of 1 2θfc and 1 1θfc were designed the optimal pre planting soil water content that can ensure maximum cotton emergence and thus guarantee the highest seed cotton yield and biomass was determined to be between 0 8 θfc and θfc for maximum cotton yield at harvest the irrigation level during the cotton growing season should be kept within the range of 30 36 mm this simulation result can serve as a reference for cotton irrigation strategies in the tarim basin however further verification from a large scale field experiment is required 5 conclusion calibration and verification of the dssat cropgro cotton model revealed that the model can accurately simulate cotton phenology and seed cotton yield but gave a large error for biomass simulation presumably due to the local field management practices of topping and pruning in the cotton fields according to the simulations the maximum seed cotton yield and biomass can be obtained from a pre planting soil water content of 0 8 θfc θfc and the maintenance of irrigation levels at 30 36 mm during the cotton growing season these simulation results may serve as reference data for cotton irrigation strategies in the tarim basin declaration of competing interest there are no

10493,pre planting soil moisture plays an important role in regulating plant emergence rate and yield yet there is a paucity of studies on the response of cotton growth and yield to pre planting soil moisture in arid regions in this study the cropgro cotton model was used to simulate cotton growth and yield in a mulched drip irrigation system with the interaction of different pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels during the cotton growing season this was undertaken to determine the optimal pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels that would produce the highest cotton yield and biomass values in the model simulations experimental data of cotton phenology and the biomass and yield at the maturing stage in 2017 and 2018 was used to calibrate and verify the dssat cropgro cotton model outputs based on the calibrated cropgro cotton model scenario simulation was performed using three irrigation levels 24 mm 30 mm 36 mm and eight pre planting soil water contents 1 2 θfc 1 1 θfc θfc field water holding capacity 0 9 θfc 0 8 θfc 0 7 θfc 0 6 θfc and 0 5 θfc the results showed that the simulated cotton phenology and seed cotton yield produced by the calibrated cropgro cotton model showed good fits with the observed values thus satisfying the accuracy requirement for large scale mulched drip irrigated cotton field simulations however large deviations were observed between simulated and observed biomass values according to the simulations the maximum seed cotton yield and biomass can be obtained from a pre planting soil water content of 0 8 θfc θfc and the maintenance of irrigation levels at 30 36 mm during the cotton growing season these simulation results may serve as reference data for cotton crop production and irrigation management in the tarim basin keywords cotton yield cropgro cotton model irrigation levels mulched drip irrigation pre planting soil moisture 1 introduction the tarim basin is located to the south of the tian shan mountain range with its ample heat and sunshine the tarim basin offers very suitable conditions for the cultivation of cotton crops in 2018 the total cotton cultivation area in the tarim basin covered approximately 1 32 million ha2 accounting for 63 of all cotton cultivation areas in xinjiang the tarim basin region is a typical oasis irrigation area with agricultural irrigation accounting for approximately 90 of the total water consumption specifically the cotton cultivation process faces problems such as low utilisation efficiency of irrigation water and severe wastage of water resources optimisation of the irrigation system in this region may effectively reduce the water demands of cotton production and increase water use efficiency currently the methods used to optimise cotton irrigation systems mainly involve field irrigation experiments however these experiments require a long period of time to complete and can be labour intensive the results can also be affected by many different factors which may require an array of trials that may use different measuring standards furthermore different outcomes can be obtained from trials conducted in different locations therefore it is important to explore a more convenient and effective method for the guidance of cotton production practices in the tarim basin in recent years crop growth models have been widely used to simulate crop growth and development formulate irrigation systems and investigate water and fertiliser coupling crop growth models are able to quantitatively and dynamically describe the growth development and yield formation of crops and their impact on the environment crop growth models are systematic predictive mechanistic and versatile they are also less labour intensive and require fewer material resources to implement compared with field experiments the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat models are currently among the most widely used crop models gijsman et al 2002 jones et al 2003 and encompass many well known models such as ceres crop environment resource synthesis and cropgro crop growth within the dssat platform the cropgro cotton model developed specifically for cotton has been extensively studied in many locations worldwide rinaldi 2004 ortiz et al 2009 thorp et al 2014 modala et al 2015 soler and hoogenboom 2006 reported that the cropgro cotton model is an effective tool for simulating different irrigation strategies because it is able to accurately predict the cotton phenology stages and crop yield rahman et al 2017 believed that this model can evaluate potential strategies to support decision making in cotton management practices including the determination of the optimal planting date in addition when simulating the interactions of different nitrogen application and planting dates the cropgro cotton model can better simulate the cotton phenology stages leaf area index crop yield as well as the long term temporal distribution of cotton yield and the marginal value per unit of water over seasonal evapotranspiration and different irrigation levels cammarano et al 2012 wajid et al 2014 adhikari et al 2017 this model also demonstrated that the employment of deficit irrigation practices under normal weather conditions can conserve water without adversely affecting seed cotton yields however under drought conditions the risk of increased yield loss should be considered when adopting deficit irrigation strategies modala et al 2015 amin et al 2017 estimated the optimal phosphorus application using the dssat csm cropgro cotton model for two cotton cultivars grown during 2013 2014 and the simulations were fairly consistent with the observations wu et al 2015 applied two methods to perform sensitivity analyses on the parameters of the cropgro cotton model model verification and evaluation of the calibrated parameters was also performed using a simulation of three different irrigation levels with respect to days of initial flowering and maturing seed cotton yield aboveground dry biomass maximum leaf area index and evapotranspiration the impacts of the input parameters were also verified and evaluated zheng 2018 estimated the effects of different nitrogen applications on cotton crop yield using the dssat model and evaluated the accuracy and applicability of using the dssat model to simulate cotton production under nitrogen limiting conditions collectively these studies demonstrated the extensive use of the cropgro cotton model for the simulation and application of cotton growth under different conditions as well as its good results factors affecting cotton production in the tarim basin include different irrigation approaches irrigation levels during the growing season and fertiliser applications in addition the emergence rate of cotton which in turn is largely affected by the pre planting soil moisture also contributes significantly to crop yield the pre planting irrigation in spring is required for high emergence rate of seeds in local cotton production however the influence of different pre planting soil water contents on the emergence rate of cotton seeds and cotton growth was seldom studied especially with the scenario simulation therefore in this study the cropgro cotton model was used to simulate the growth and yield of cotton in a mulched drip irrigation system under the influence of different pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels with the aim of obtaining the highest cotton yield and biomass while also determining the optimal pre planting soil moisture and irrigation level for cotton fields the results provide reference data which can be used to improve the cotton emergence rate decrease the pre planting irrigation levels in spring reduce the wastage of water and formulate rational spring irrigation strategies for cotton 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was performed in 2017 2018 at the soil and

application because there is no mulch module in the cropgro cotton model the model cannot simulate the effects of plastic film mulch on the soil plant system in consideration of this limitation of the dssat cropgro cotton model we modified the potential evapotranspiration model and the extinction coefficient of evaporation process according to li et al 2019 as follows 1 the potential evapotranspiration was calculated by the penmen monteith p m method the default method in the cropgro cotton model is the priestley taylor p t model the climate of southern xinjiang is characterised

reported that the accuracy of the potential evapotranspiration calculation was improved by changing the default extinction coefficient from 0 85 to 0 5 the average extinction coefficient of par for cotton was 0 57 which was measured in the 2019 season with li 190 sa and li 191 sa quantum sensors li cor inc lincoln ne usa according to the method of goudriaan 1977 the extinction coefficient of solar radiation was 0 47 which was used in the model the film ratio in this study was 0 80 which was used to improve soil evaporation calculation 3 the measured values of soil moisture before planting were input into the model the emergence rate was modified according to the measured value after the emergence of cotton 3 1 model parameterisation and evaluation genetic coefficient parameterisation was performed using the glue generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation genetic coefficient estimator which is included in the dssat platform experimental data from 2017 were chosen for parameter calibration while data from 2018 were used for model verification and evaluation various statistical analysis methods including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse normalised root mean square error nrmse and absolute relative error are were used as the evaluation indices for model calibration and to verify the reliability of the results the formulae used are as follows 1 are s i o i o i 100 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 4 nrmse rmse o 100 where si and oi are the simulated values and observed values respectively o is the mean observed value s o is the mean simulated value and n is the sample size 3 2 calibration of the cultivar parameters in the model for the localised application of the cropgro cotton model the genetic coefficient must first be determined which requires the calibration of the cultivar parameters in the model based on the 2017 experimental data from the three irrigation levels the cotton phenology flowering stage and maturing stage total biomass aboveground at harvest and seed cotton yield were used as the output variables for model parameter calibration the parameter optimisation criterion involved minimising the ares of these output variables to determine the cultivar parameters as shown in table 3 3 3 verification and evaluation of the model after parameterisation the optimal cultivar parameters were input into the model and the resultant cotton phenology yield and biomass were verified as shown in table 4 calibration of the model using the 2017 experimental data resulted in a good fit between the simulated and observed results ares between the simulated and observed flowering stage maturing stage biomass and seed cotton yield were 0 2 74 10 97 and 9 02 respectively which indicated that the model had good simulation effects for the flowering stage maturing stage and seed cotton yield data however biomass showed a significant deviation between the simulated and observed values model verification using the 2018 experimental data revealed a goof fit between the simulated and observed flowering stage maturing stage and seed cotton yield data with all ares 10 when the irrigation level was 30 mm during the cotton growing phase this indicated that these variables could accurately reflect the effects of different irrigation strategies on cotton phenology and seed cotton yield however model simulated biomass data deviated greatly from observed values the accuracy of cotton growth and yield data simulated by the cropgro cotton model was further evaluated using other statistical parameters table 5 model accuracy for the simulated seasonal phenology of 2017 and 2018 was relatively high with both nrmse 10 for the predicted seed cotton yield nrmse for 2017 and 2018 was 15 while the r2 values were 0 58 and 0 9 respectively indicating that the model was able to accurately simulate the seed cotton yield however the nrmse for cotton aboveground biomass was low in 2017 with r2 0 5 whereas in 2018 the nrmse was 30 with r2 close to 1 these differences indicated that the model was not able to accurately simulate cotton biomass possibly due to the local field management practices of topping and pruning in the cotton fields collectively the results indicated that the cropgro cotton model can satisfactorily simulate cotton phenology and seed cotton yield and can be used as a guide for cotton crop production and irrigation management in the tarim basin fig 1 table 6 3 4 application of the dssat cropgro cotton model simulation 3 4 1 scenario settings for pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels pre planting soil water content is an important factor that affects cotton emergence growth and yield it is important to establish a suitable pre planting irrigation strategy to ensure sufficient soil moisture for cotton germination therefore the calibrated dssat cropgro cotton model was used in this study to simulate the cotton biomass and seed cotton yield under different conditions of pre planting soil moisture and irrigation levels these simulations could enable the determination of suitable pre planting soil water contents for sowing cotton seeds and thus provide a theoretical basis for spring irrigation strategies in cotton fields a total of eight simulation scenarios for pre planting soil water contents were selected 1 2θfc 1 1θfc θfc field capacity 0 9θfc 0 8θfc 0 7θfc 0 6θfc and 0 5θfc based on the results of the 2017 and 2018 seasons three different irrigation levels 24 mm 30 mm and 36 mm were selected for each scenario during the cotton growing seasun with the depth of the wet layer being 30 cm based on our previous experiment of seed germination the emergence rate was 23 seeds m 2 for the pre planting soil moisture of 1 2θfc 0 8θfc 22 seeds m 2 for the pre planting soil moisture of 0 7θfc 19 seeds m 2 for the pre planting soil moisture of 0 6θfc 16 seeds m 2 for the pre planting soil moisture of 0 6θfc respectively determination of the irrigation schedule during the growing phase was based on the cotton experiments in 2017 and 2018 table 7 3 4 2 prediction of cotton yield and biomass for different pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels figs 2 and 3 show the seed cotton yield and biomass estimations of the calibrated dssat cropgro cotton model under different irrigation levels and pre planting soil water contents the simulation results showed that the seed cotton yield was the highest at an irrigation level of 24 mm and when the pre planting soil water content was equal to the θfc the seed cotton yield did not increase in scenarios with higher soil water contents but the seed cotton yield did decrease significantly as the pre planting soil moisture decreased the simulated values of biomass also showed similar change trends at an irrigation level of 30 mm the difference in seed cotton yield among pre planting soil water contents of 1 2θfc 1 1θfc and θfc was relatively small whereas the yield was reduced by 3 25 and 7 56 for soil water contents of 0 9θfc and 0 8θfc respectively compared to θfc and the drop in seed cotton yield was even more significant for scenarios with lower soil water contents the simulation indicated higher cotton biomass values for pre planting soil water contents of 0 9 θfc and 0 8 θfc than soil moisture of 1 2 θfc 1 1 θfc and θfc and the lowest biomass values for 0 6 θfc and 0 5 θfc at an irrigation level of 36 mm the seed cotton yield was increased by 0 21 and 0 33 for pre planting soil water contents of 1 2 θfc and 1 1 θfc respectively when compared to θfc whereas the yield only decreased by 0 09 0 85 and 3 83 for soil water contents of 0 9 θfc 0 8 θfc and 0 7 θfc respectively the decrease in seed cotton yield was more significant in scenarios with 0 6 θfc and 0 5 θfc the simulated and observed values of cotton biomass showed similar change trends 4 discussion in this study the dssat cropgro cotton model was calibrated and verified using cotton phenology biomass and yield data at the maturing stage collected during the 2017 and 2018 experiments in the tarim basin as there is no mulch module in the dssat cropgro cotton model the model was modified according to the suggestion of li et al 2019 li et al 2019 indicated that the performance of the dssat cropgro cotton model would be improved by modifying the potential evapotranspiration method and the extinction coefficients of the soil evaporation process the cropgro model cannot simulate soil salt dynamics however based on the results from the 2017 2018 seasons the ec value in 0 30 cm soil layer from sowing to early budding stage was lower than 350 μs cm 1 which has little impacts on cotton germination and growth after the early budding stage although the increase in air temperature induced high evaporation rates the ec value in 0 30 cm soil depth was lower than 1 ms cm 1 as the plots were irrigated every 7 10 days there was no significant accumulation of salt in the topsoil therefore only soil moisture was simulated by the cropgro model the simulated and observed values of several indicators showed a good fit with the exception of biomass which showed significant deviations between simulated and observed values the calibrated model was verified using the experimental data from 2018 at irrigation levels of 30 mm the simulated and observed flowering stage maturing stage and seed cotton yield data showed a good fit to further test the simulation accuracy of seed cotton yield and phenology nrmse and r2 were employed to statistically analyse the results statistical analysis showed that the calibrated model was able to accurately simulate seed cotton yield and phenology in the tarim basin wajid et al 2014 also reported that the total dry matter of cotton and seed cotton yield simulated by the dssat model was relatively accurate however due to the local field management practices of topping and pruning in cotton fields the simulation of cotton biomass was unsatisfactory in the present study parameters relevant to such agronomic practices are also missing in the dssat cropgro cotton model future studies and further calibration of the model should therefore consider the effects of different field management practices spring irrigation before cultivation is a routine practice in cotton crop production in the tarim basin region to increase soil moisture in general cases this involves a once off pre planting irrigation at levels of 3750 4500 m3 ha 2 however this practice can lead to farmland drainage and severe water wastage under the same field management practices cotton emergence rate is significantly affected by the pre planting soil water content such that the emergence rate would decrease if the soil water content is too high or too low which in turn is unfavourable for the subsequent cotton yield therefore the simulation process should consider the effect of pre planting soil water content the optimal pre planting soil water content obtained from the simulation results can serve as the theoretical basis for the determination of a suitable spring irrigation level existing simulation studies using the dssat cropgro cotton model have focused more on the simulation of cotton phenology growth and production under different irrigation methods irrigation levels and fertiliser applications cammarano et al 2012 wu et al 2015 adhikari et al 2017 rahman et al 2017 amin et al 2017 zheng 2018 while less attention is paid to pre planting soil moisture cotton emergence or even pre planting spring irrigation levels therefore this study used the calibrated dssat cropgro cotton model to simulate cotton yield and biomass under the interaction of different pre planting soil water contents and irrigation levels during the cotton growing season the experiment was conducted in a saline alkali soil with average value of electrical conductivity of 600 μs cm 1 although the salt content in the soil was low salinity stress for cotton growth and yield formation would be limited as salt accumulation on the soil surface was induced by high evaporation especially in the seed gemination and budding stage in order to mitigate the negative effects of salinity on germination soil moisture levels of 1 2θfc and 1 1θfc were designed the optimal pre planting soil water content that can ensure maximum cotton emergence and thus guarantee the highest seed cotton yield and biomass was determined to be between 0 8 θfc and θfc for maximum cotton yield at harvest the irrigation level during the cotton growing season should be kept within the range of 30 36 mm this simulation result can serve as a reference for cotton irrigation strategies in the tarim basin however further verification from a large scale field experiment is required 5 conclusion calibration and verification of the dssat cropgro cotton model revealed that the model can accurately simulate cotton phenology and seed cotton yield but gave a large error for biomass simulation presumably due to the local field management practices of topping and pruning in the cotton fields according to the simulations the maximum seed cotton yield and biomass can be obtained from a pre planting soil water content of 0 8 θfc θfc and the maintenance of irrigation levels at 30 36 mm during the cotton growing season these simulation results may serve as reference data for cotton irrigation strategies in the tarim basin declaration of competing interest there are no

10494,plastic mulching increases crop yield and water use efficiency wue however its sustainability in regard to crop productivity and inter annual soil water balance is widely doubted this study comprises a long term field experiment 2010 2019 with spring maize and wheat treated as materials and two treatments of 1 whole field plastic mulching pm and 2 without mulching ck the results showed that the soil water storage in the sowing stage decreased significantly in the 100 300 cm profile after 10 years of maize planting in both pm and ck but there was no significant difference between pm and ck for wheat pm on average increased soil water storage by 30 1 mm in the 0 300 cm profile but ck decreased it by 28 7 mm in the sowing stage in 2019 these results indicated that soil water depletion was caused by maize water uptake not pm the pm significantly p 0 05 increased grain yield of maize and wheat by averages of 276 7 and 82 1 compared with ck respectively especially in drought years the grain yield of maize increased by 400 0 and 622 2 2011 and 2016 respectively and of wheat by 405 1 and 231 5 2011 and 2017 respectively the relative variation coefficient of yield and wue of pm decreased by 101 9 and 207 9 in maize respectively and correspondingly by 48 3 and 47 2 in wheat compared with ck our findings were that i soil water depletion depended on crop water uptake characteristics and the conflict between soil water supply and crop demand was relieved by pm ii pm stably increased crop productivity and maintained the inter annual water balance and iii pm should

however along with increased crop yield there are negative effects of plastic mulching on soil quality soil water balance and plastic waste pollution especially the water balance is of most concern to scientist and farmers as well as soil quality e g nutrient element activity soil organic matter and microorganisms field experimental results showed that soil water was depleted by 125 57 192 98 mm down to 180 cm depths in winter wheat on the northwest loess plateau zhao et al 2018a b after 6 years of maize continuous cropping on the northwest loess plateau annual precipitation around 400 mm soil water storage sws with plastic mulching decreased by 163 59 mm comprising 5 21 mm in the 0 140 cm and 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layers wang et al 2018 similar results were reported by wu et al 2018 in which sws in the 100 200 cm profile of a plastic mulched field decreased by 28 mm at harvest stage compared with a no mulching field these results suggest that the plastic mulching increased soil water depletion the water consumption of wheat and maize reaches to 500 mm under plastic mulch and sufficient soil moisture conditions ren et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 and exceeds the precipitation in most parts of semiarid area how does plastic mulching work in a region where precipitation does not meet crop demand is this soil water depletion caused by plastic mulching crop water uptake characteristics or is plastic mulching improving crop uptake under semiarid conditions this issue requires a long term field investigation to resolve it and is crucial to evaluating plastic mulching sustainability for crop production for this purpose a long term field experiment was commenced in 2010 with wheat and maize selected as trial materials and two treatments with and without plastic mulching within the experiments the ws precipitation evapotranspiration et and grain yield were recorded and wue rainwater fallow efficiency rfe inter annual relative coefficient of variation rcv of grain yield and wue were calculated the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the effect of plastic mulching on soil water balance and crop water utilization in maize and wheat fields and 2 determine the sustainability of plastic mulching for crop production 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental treatments the study site was located at the dingxi

conducted during the growing seasons of 2010 2019 for the maize experiment the two treatments were 1 continuous maize cropping with double ridge and furrows i e ridge furrow and plastic mulching pm and 2 continuous maize cropping without ridge furrow planting and plastic mulching ck maize was seeded 5 8 cm deep into soil with moisture content of 10 15 using a maize sower with 30 cm spacing in mid april giving a planting density of approximately 60 000 plants ha 1 the wheat experiment which was close to the maize experiment had two treatments 1 continuous wheat cropping with soil plastic mulching pm and 2 continuous wheat cropping without plastic mulching ck wheat was bunch seeded at 5 8 cm deep into soil with moisture content of 10 15 using a bunching sower with 10 cm spacing in mid march giving a planting density of approximately 450 000 bunch ha 1 with a mean of 10 plants per bunch fig 1 for maize the method of double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching comprised a wide ridge of height 10 cm and width of 70 cm and a narrow ridge of height 15 cm and width 40 cm which were mulched with plastic film and with seeds sown in the furrow for wheat the method of soil plastic mulching used plastic mulching after tillage and then the 0 5 1 0 cm thickness soil covered on the plastic to decrease soil temperature in the filling stage of wheat fig 1 all treatments were rotary tilled once after crop harvest i e maize and wheat at the end of october and july respectively with plastic film mulch applied immediately after tillage to inhibit evaporation all treatments were arranged in a randomized complete design with three replications the area of each plot was 8 m 10 m 60 m2 for maize and 7 m 7 5 m 52 5 m2 for wheat maize was sown on 16 18 20 23 17 19 20 20 18 and 22 april for 2010 2019 respectively and correspondingly harvested on 13 12 12 13 15 13 10 11 12 and 16 october similarly wheat was sown on 21 25 25 21 23 19 18 23 20 and 18 march and harvested on 21 18 17 15 19 22 21 23 18 and 25 july generally the maturity of pm advanced almost 7 10 days compared to ck for maize and 5 7 days for wheat fertilizer rates of n p2o5 and k2o were 225 150 and 90 kg ha 1 for maize respectively and correspondingly 150 120 and 75 kg ha 1 for wheat applied once before tillage in each year 2 2 precipitation precipitation was determined using meteorological data of the dingxi experimental station of gansu academy of agricultural sciences half of the rainfall generally occurred in the growth period and half in the fallow period for wheat and correspondingly 73 and 27 for maize fig 2 serious drought occurred in 2011 and 2017 for wheat with annual precipitation only 63 4 and 66 7 of the average respectively and during the wheat growth period of only 50 9 and 67 8 of the average wet years occurred in 2013 and 2018 exceeding average precipitation by more than 20 in the annual and wheat growth periods the other years had approximately average precipitation for maize serious drought occurred in 2011 and 2016 with annual precipitation of 78 3 and 65 4 of average and precipitation in the maize growth period of 87 3 and 65 2 of average respectively in 2019 precipitation in the maize growth period was only 66 7 of average with remarkable seasonal drought the other years had approximately average precipitation 2 3 measurement of sws the ws was measured at 20 cm intervals in the 0 300 cm soil profile for maize and wheat with soil cores randomly collected in each plot at the sowing and harvesting stages every year the soil samples were collected by drilling equipment and loaded into aluminum boxes the fresh weight was determined the sample was oven dried at 105 c for 12 h and then the dry weight was measured and ws w w calculated according to formula 1 the sws was calculated using formula 2 1 ws fw dw dw aw where fw is fresh weight of the soil sample with the aluminum box dw is dry weight of the soil sample with the aluminum box and aw is the weight of the aluminum box 2 sws mm ws b d where b is soil bulk density g cm 3 and d is soil depth cm the average ws from each sampling date was used in statistical analysis 2 4 total et calculation the total et was calculated using the following formula 3 et swsbf swsh pi where swsbf is soil water storage before the sowing stage swsh is soil water storage after harvesting and pi is precipitation during the crop growing period the wue was calculated as yield divided by et annual precipitation is around 400 mm and annual evaporation reaches 1500 mm in the experimental area thus percolation could be generally ignored 2 5 rainwater fallow efficiency according to shahzada and safdar the rainwater fallow efficiency rfe was calculated using the following formula 4 rfe swss mm swsh mm precipitation mm 100 where swss and swsh are the soil water storage at the sowing stage of the following year and at the harvesting stage of the current year respectively precipitation was the value for the fallow period 2 6 rcv of grain yield and wue the relative coefficient variation rcv was used to estimate the inter annual fluctuation of grain yield or wue and measure crop production stability annually rcv was obtained using the formula 5 5 r c v i 1 n x i x n 1 where the xi is the annual relative grain yield or wue x is the average of relative yield or wue n is the experimental years it is 10 in this case the relative grain yield and wue were obtained using the formula 6 6 x y i y where x are relative grain yield or wue yi is the grain yield or wue in each experimental year y is the average grain yield or wue in 10 experimental years 2 7 statistical analysis all data were subjected to analysis of variance anova sas institute cary nc usa 2004 and differences between means were compared by least significant difference duncan s multiple comparison method p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of long term pm on profile ws previous work reported that plastic mulching improved soil water conditions in wheat fields kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 hou et al 2014 ren et al 2017 however wu 2016 reported that plastic mulching significantly decreased sws in the 0 200 cm soil profile in a wheat field mainly because this one year field experiment did not determine water recharge in the fallow period our study showed that pm on average increased sws by 30 1 mm but ck decreased it by 28 7 mm in 0 300 cm profile at the sowing stage on average pm increased sws by 87 0 mm but ck decreased sws by 48 9 mm in 0 300 cm profile at harvest in wheat field respectively fig 3 the sws for pm was on average higher than ck by 58 3 and 114 3 mm at the sowing and harvesting stages in 2019 in wheat field respectively our previous study showed that maize continuous cropping resulted in deep soil water depletion in a semiarid area wang et al 2018 however after 10 years of maize continuous cropping pm decreased sws by 18 6 mm at the sowing stage but increased it by 39 1 mm at harvesting stage 61 4 mm in 140 300 cm profile ck decreased sws by 70 2 and 48 7 mm at sowing and harvesting stages 77 7 and 36 7 mm in 100 300 cm profile respectively fig 4 the sws of pm was on average higher than for ck by 51 7 and 49 3 mm at sowing and harvesting stages in 2019 respectively this differed to our previous report mainly because sufficient precipitation occurred in 2018 and 2019 with 533 3 and 499 5 mm respectively being higher than the 10 year average by 90 8 and 57 0 mm these results suggest that pm improved soil water conditions for both maize and wheat and both pm and ck depleted deep soil water for maize 3 2 effects of pm on rainwater fallow efficiency the rainwater fallow efficiency rfe representing the capacity of soil to capture and store rainwater during the fallow period hou et al 2014 depends on soil hydraulic characteristics and field surface mulching ijaz and ali 2007 gil et al 2012 keesstra et al 2016 plastic mulching with furrow ridge planting significantly increases rfe hou et al 2014 wang and shangguan 2015 because pm allows efficient harvesting of rainwater inhibits soil evaporation and increases sws in our study the 10 year average rfe of pm increased by 54 6 and 371 9 in wheat and maize fields respectively compared with ck fig 5 the rfe of pm did not fluctuate as sharply as did ck indicating that pm resulted in a relatively stable and higher rainwater harvesting and storing capacity this is advantage to soil water recharge in fallow period and maintain inter annual soil water balance 3 3 effects of pm on sws at sowing and harvesting stages due to the higher rfe the sws in pm was higher than ck the significant difference observed in 2014 and 2019 for wheat and 2016 and 2017 for maize and the 10 year average sws did not differ between pm and ck at harvest stage significant differences in sws were only observed in 2018 for wheat and there were no significant differences in all years for maize between pm and ck fig 6 the average sws at harvesting stage did not differ for both wheat and maize the results suggested that sws at sowing and harvesting stages was not changed by pm but differed according to crop type and annual precipitation 3 4 effects of pm on crop et plastic mulching was previously found to inhibit evaporation and increase the ratio of transpiration and evaporation xie et al 2005 ren et al 2017 but did not significantly increase crop et hou et al 2014 wang and shangguan 2015 wang et al 2018 similarly in our study the 10 year field experimental results showed that pm on average increased et by 29 8 and 32 4 mm in wheat and maize fields respectively compared with ck but the differences were not significant fig 7 in 2012 2014 and 2016 for wheat and 2011 2013 and 2017 for maize the et was significantly higher for pm than ck this may depend on the precipitation temporal distribution and was not affected by pm zhao et al 2018a b reported that plastic mulching may generally change the atmospheric hydraulic process by significantly decreasing evaporation however our study showed that although pm inhibited evaporation the et was increased indicating that soil atmosphere water exchange was not inhibited 3 5 effects of pm on crop grain yield and wue the pm significantly increased grain yield of both wheat and maize over the 10 years with average increases of 65 2 and 148 4 respectively the effects were larger in drought years fig 8 previous reports showed similar results to our study xie et al 2005 li et al 2007 2013 hou et al 2014 ren et al 2017 gao et al 2018 the wue was also significantly increased by pm on average by 79 0 for wheat and 221 4 for maize fig 9 these results suggest that pm increased grain yield and wue in long term wheat and maize continuous cropping and its effects on these increments were stable and sustainable 3 6 effects of pm on rcv of grain yield and wue the rcv reflects the variation in grain yield and wue among the experimental years with lower rcv indicating higher stability of the agronomic production system the pm significantly decreased rcv of grain yield and wue for both maize and wheat for wheat pm decreased rcv of grain yield and wue by 48 3 and 47 2 respectively fig 10 a and c and the corresponding values for maize were 50 5 and 67 5 compared with ck fig 10b and d these suggested that pm mulching stably increased crop productivity in this semiarid rain fed area decreasing the risk of abiotic stresses to crop productivity 3 7 the quantitative relationships between crop yield and wue with et the grain yield of both wheat and maize showed a significant positive linear correlation with et significantly fig 10a b however in the regression equation between wheat grain yield and et the slope of pm was lower than ck while the slop of maize was opposite to that of wheat these suggested that the grain yield of maize was more sensitive to et as compared with wheat there was a significant negative linear correlation between wheat wue and et in pm fig 10c but had no significant correlation in ck however for maize the wue were positively correlated with et in both pm and ck fig 10 d and the slope of pm was lower than ck comprehensively this paper showed that long term pm significantly increased maize and wheat yield without increasing soil water consumption the pm improved soil water conditions for wheat but depleted deep soil water for maize compared with that at the sowing stage in 2010 this suggested that the soil water depletion was caused by the different crops not by pm in addition both maize yield and wue were positively linearly correlated with et either in pm or ck rather than positively with grain yield but wue was negatively linearly correlated with et at the wheat point indicating that the soil moisture could not meet maize demand in general and soil water was depleted in maize field fig 11 in fact pm relieved this depletion and so the soil water imbalance was not driven by in appropriate crop planting technology additionally pm stably increased crop yield and wue and is a promising way to sustain food security and increase farm income especially in this kind of semiarid area consequently plastic film should be treated like chemical fertilizer for agricultural productivity to conquer food shortages for the drier and more crowded future the future tasks is to focus on plastic material innovation produce environmental friendly film e g biodegradable and study planting technology appropriate to the regional natural resources especially precipitation keesstra et al 2018 4 conclusions the long term plastic mulching did not significantly affected soil water balance the deep soil water depletion occurred because the soil water could not

10494,plastic mulching increases crop yield and water use efficiency wue however its sustainability in regard to crop productivity and inter annual soil water balance is widely doubted this study comprises a long term field experiment 2010 2019 with spring maize and wheat treated as materials and two treatments of 1 whole field plastic mulching pm and 2 without mulching ck the results showed that the soil water storage in the sowing stage decreased significantly in the 100 300 cm profile after 10 years of maize planting in both pm and ck but there was no significant difference between pm and ck for wheat pm on average increased soil water storage by 30 1 mm in the 0 300 cm profile but ck decreased it by 28 7 mm in the sowing stage in 2019 these results indicated that soil water depletion was caused by maize water uptake not pm the pm significantly p 0 05 increased grain yield of maize and wheat by averages of 276 7 and 82 1 compared with ck respectively especially in drought years the grain yield of maize increased by 400 0 and 622 2 2011 and 2016 respectively and of wheat by 405 1 and 231 5 2011 and 2017 respectively the relative variation coefficient of yield and wue of pm decreased by 101 9 and 207 9 in maize respectively and correspondingly by 48 3 and 47 2 in wheat compared with ck our findings were that i soil water depletion depended on crop water uptake characteristics and the conflict between soil water supply and crop demand was relieved by pm ii pm stably increased crop productivity and maintained the inter annual water balance and iii pm should be explored widely in semiarid areas and the plastic waste problem addressed to ensure future food security keywords plastic mulching soil water balance crop production sustainability maize wheat semiarid rain fed area 1 introduction low precipitation and high evaporation are the main factors causing lower crop production in arid and semiarid areas which cover 40 of the global land surface huang et al 2016 and are the main regions suffering starvation and poverty worldwide fao 2019 however such regions have potential for crop yield increments which is crucial for food security of the rapidly growing human population reynolds et al 2007 feng and fu 2013 sherwood and fu 2014 abate et al 2015 soil mulching is a promising way to increase crop yield in such region cerdà et al 2017 keesstra et al 2019 the northwest loess plateau of china with annual precipitation and evaporation of 300 600 and 1200 1600 mm respectively hou et al 2014 is a typical semiarid area with low crop yields average wheat yield is around 1000 1500 kg ha 1 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2014 recently plastic mulching technology has been used widely for maize and wheat production in this region this has increased yields by more than 30 and economic income by 140 1200 usd ha 1 li et al 2013 hou et al 2014 and resolved food shortages making this a successful model of crop productivity increment in a semiarid rain fed area the benefits of plastic mulching to crop production are well documented liu et al 2003 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 qin et al 2015 ren et al 2017 sun et al 2019 generally plastic mulching inhibits the heat and gas exchange between soil and atmosphere resulting in a series of changes in soil physical chemical and biological characteristics and in crop development kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 farmer et al 2016 first plastic mulching with ridge furrow planting increases rainwater harvesting xie et al 2005 hou et al 2014 wang and shangguan 2015 and inhibits soil water evaporation resulting in higher soil water content ws and the ratio of transpiration to evaporation li et al 2007 2013 wu et al 2018 second inhibiting the heat and gas exchange between soil and atmosphere raises the water vapor concentration between soil and plastic film and the greenhouse effect of the water vapor significantly increases soil temperature liu et al 2003 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 third the higher soil temperatures can favor nitrogen n mineralization wilson and jefferies 1996 zhang et al 2012 increase the available phosphorus content li et al 2007 hu et al 2012

nutrient uptake liu et al 2003 farmer et al 2016 li et al 2018 can increase photosynthetic assimilation hou et al 2019 and results in significantly increasing crop yield and water use efficiency wue however along with increased crop yield there are negative effects of plastic mulching on soil quality soil water balance and plastic waste pollution especially the water balance is of most concern to scientist and farmers as well as soil quality e g nutrient element activity soil organic matter and microorganisms field experimental results showed that soil water was depleted by 125 57 192 98 mm down to 180 cm depths in winter wheat on the northwest loess plateau zhao et al 2018a b after 6 years of maize continuous cropping on the northwest loess plateau annual precipitation around 400 mm soil water storage sws with plastic mulching decreased by 163 59 mm comprising 5 21 mm in the 0 140 cm and 158 37 mm in the 140 300 cm layers wang et al 2018 similar results were reported by wu et al 2018 in which sws in the 100 200 cm profile of a plastic mulched field decreased by 28 mm at harvest stage compared with a no mulching field these results suggest that the plastic mulching increased soil water depletion the water consumption of wheat and maize reaches to 500 mm under plastic mulch and sufficient soil moisture conditions ren et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 and exceeds the precipitation in most parts of semiarid area how does plastic mulching work in a region where precipitation does not meet crop demand is this soil water depletion caused by plastic mulching crop water uptake characteristics or is plastic mulching improving crop uptake under semiarid conditions this issue requires a long term field investigation to resolve it and is crucial to evaluating plastic mulching sustainability for crop production for this purpose a long term field experiment was commenced in 2010 with wheat and maize selected as trial materials and two treatments with and without plastic mulching within the experiments the ws precipitation evapotranspiration et and grain yield were recorded and wue rainwater fallow efficiency rfe inter annual relative coefficient of variation rcv of grain yield and wue were calculated the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the effect of plastic mulching on soil water balance and crop water utilization in maize and wheat fields and 2 determine the sustainability of plastic mulching for crop production 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental treatments the study site was located at the dingxi experimental station of the gansu academy of agricultural science anding district gansu province 104 36 e 35 35 n at an altitude of approximately 1970 m based on 35 years of records mean annual rainfall is 415 mm with nearly 68 occurring during june september the relative variability of precipitation is 24 mean annual temperature is 6 2 c and average annual sunshine hours are 2500 h the soil is a light loam of loess origin with organic matter content around 1 and without salinity and alkalinity problems the average ws w w at field capacity and wilting point was 23 6 and 7 2 in the 0 100 cm profile respectively before this experiment was conducted soil samples were collected randomly at five points to determine the contents of soil organic matter total nitrogen n total phosphorus total potassium ammonium n nitrate n available phosphorus and available potassium 11 99 1 16 0 73 and 17 28 g kg 1 and 4 8 0 8 8 66 and 121 50 mg kg 1 respectively in this study two treatments were conducted during the growing seasons of 2010 2019 for the maize experiment the two treatments were 1 continuous maize cropping with double ridge and furrows i e ridge furrow and plastic mulching pm and 2 continuous maize cropping without ridge furrow planting and plastic mulching ck maize was seeded 5 8 cm deep into soil with moisture content of 10 15 using a maize sower with 30 cm spacing in mid april giving a planting density of approximately 60 000 plants ha 1 the wheat experiment which was close to the maize experiment had two treatments 1 continuous wheat cropping with soil plastic mulching pm and 2 continuous wheat cropping without plastic mulching ck wheat was bunch seeded at 5 8 cm deep into soil with moisture content of 10 15 using a bunching sower with 10 cm spacing in mid march giving a planting density of approximately 450 000 bunch ha 1 with a mean of 10 plants per bunch fig 1 for maize the method of double ridge and furrows with plastic mulching comprised a wide ridge of height 10 cm and width of 70 cm and a narrow ridge of height 15 cm and width 40 cm which were mulched with plastic film and with seeds sown in the furrow for wheat the method of soil plastic mulching used plastic mulching after tillage and then the 0 5 1 0 cm thickness soil covered on the plastic to decrease soil temperature in the filling stage of wheat fig 1 all treatments were rotary tilled once after crop harvest i e maize and wheat at the end of october and july respectively with plastic film mulch applied immediately after tillage to inhibit evaporation all treatments were arranged in a randomized complete design with three replications the area of each plot was 8 m 10 m 60 m2 for maize and 7 m 7 5 m 52 5 m2 for wheat maize was sown on 16 18 20 23 17 19 20 20 18 and 22 april for 2010 2019 respectively and correspondingly harvested on 13 12 12 13 15 13 10 11 12 and 16 october similarly wheat was sown on 21 25 25 21 23 19 18 23 20 and 18 march and harvested on 21 18 17 15 19 22 21 23 18 and 25 july generally the maturity of pm advanced almost 7 10 days compared to ck for maize and 5 7 days for wheat fertilizer rates of n p2o5 and k2o were 225 150 and 90 kg ha 1 for maize respectively and correspondingly 150 120 and 75 kg ha 1 for wheat applied once before tillage in each year 2 2 precipitation precipitation was determined using meteorological data of the dingxi experimental station of gansu academy of agricultural sciences half of the rainfall generally occurred in the growth period and half in the fallow period for wheat and correspondingly 73 and 27 for maize fig 2 serious drought occurred in 2011 and 2017 for wheat with annual precipitation only 63 4 and 66 7 of the average respectively and during the wheat growth period of only 50 9 and 67 8 of the average wet years occurred in 2013 and 2018 exceeding average precipitation by more than 20 in the annual and wheat growth periods the other years had approximately average precipitation for maize serious drought occurred in 2011 and 2016 with annual precipitation of 78 3 and 65 4 of average and precipitation in the maize growth period of 87 3 and 65 2 of average respectively in 2019 precipitation in the maize growth period was only 66 7 of average with remarkable seasonal drought the other years had approximately average precipitation 2 3 measurement of sws the ws was measured at 20 cm intervals in the 0 300 cm soil profile for maize and wheat with soil cores randomly collected in each plot at the sowing and harvesting stages every year the soil samples were collected by drilling equipment and loaded into aluminum boxes the fresh weight was determined the sample was oven dried at 105 c for 12 h and then the dry weight was measured and ws w w calculated according to formula 1 the sws was calculated using formula 2 1 ws fw dw dw aw where fw is fresh weight of the soil sample with the aluminum box dw is dry weight of the soil sample with the aluminum box and aw is the weight of the aluminum box 2 sws mm ws b d where b is soil bulk density g cm 3 and d is soil depth cm the average ws from each sampling date was used in statistical analysis 2 4 total et calculation the total et was calculated using the following formula 3 et swsbf swsh pi where swsbf is soil water storage before the sowing stage swsh is soil water storage after harvesting and pi is precipitation during the crop growing period the wue was calculated as yield divided by et annual precipitation is around 400 mm and annual evaporation reaches 1500 mm in the experimental area thus percolation could be generally ignored 2 5 rainwater fallow efficiency according to shahzada and safdar the rainwater fallow efficiency rfe was calculated using the following formula 4 rfe swss mm swsh mm precipitation mm 100 where swss and swsh are the soil water storage at the sowing stage of the following year and at the harvesting stage of the current year respectively precipitation was the value for the fallow period 2 6 rcv of grain yield and wue the relative coefficient variation rcv was used to estimate the inter annual fluctuation of grain yield or wue and measure crop production stability annually rcv was obtained using the formula 5 5 r c v i 1 n x i x n 1 where the xi is the annual relative grain yield or wue x is the average of relative yield or wue n is the experimental years it is 10 in this case the relative grain yield and wue were obtained using the formula 6 6 x y i y where x are relative grain yield or wue yi is the grain yield or wue in each experimental year y is the average grain yield or wue in 10 experimental years 2 7 statistical analysis all data were subjected to analysis of variance anova sas institute cary nc usa 2004 and differences between means were compared by least significant difference duncan s multiple comparison method p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of long term pm on profile ws previous work reported that plastic mulching improved soil water conditions in wheat fields kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 hou et al 2014 ren et al 2017 however wu 2016 reported that plastic mulching significantly decreased sws in the 0 200 cm soil profile in a wheat field mainly because this one year field experiment did not determine water recharge in the fallow period our study showed that pm on average increased sws by 30 1 mm but ck decreased it by 28 7 mm in 0 300 cm profile at the sowing stage on average pm increased sws by 87 0 mm but ck decreased sws by 48 9 mm in 0 300 cm profile at harvest in wheat field respectively fig 3 the sws for pm was on average higher than ck by 58 3 and 114 3 mm at the sowing and harvesting stages in 2019 in wheat field respectively our previous study showed that maize continuous cropping resulted in deep soil water depletion in a semiarid area wang et al 2018 however after 10 years of maize continuous cropping pm decreased sws by 18 6 mm at the sowing stage but increased it by 39 1 mm at harvesting stage 61 4 mm in 140 300 cm profile ck decreased sws by 70 2 and 48 7 mm at sowing and harvesting stages 77 7 and 36 7 mm in 100 300 cm profile respectively fig 4 the sws of pm was on average higher than for ck by 51 7 and 49 3 mm at sowing and harvesting stages in 2019 respectively this differed to our previous report mainly because sufficient precipitation occurred in 2018 and 2019 with 533 3 and 499 5 mm respectively being higher than the 10 year average by 90 8 and 57 0 mm these results suggest that pm improved soil water conditions for both maize and wheat and both pm and ck depleted deep soil water for maize 3 2 effects of pm on rainwater fallow efficiency the rainwater fallow efficiency rfe representing the capacity of soil to capture and store rainwater during the fallow period hou et al 2014 depends on soil hydraulic characteristics and field surface mulching ijaz and ali 2007 gil et al 2012 keesstra et al 2016 plastic mulching with furrow ridge planting significantly increases rfe hou et al 2014 wang and shangguan 2015 because pm allows efficient harvesting of rainwater inhibits soil evaporation and increases sws in our study the 10 year average rfe of pm increased by 54 6 and 371 9 in wheat and maize fields respectively compared with ck fig 5 the rfe of pm did not fluctuate as sharply as did ck indicating that pm resulted in a relatively stable and higher rainwater harvesting and storing capacity this is advantage to soil water recharge in fallow period and maintain inter annual soil water balance 3 3 effects of pm on sws at sowing and harvesting stages due to the higher rfe the sws in pm was higher than ck the significant difference observed in 2014 and 2019 for wheat and 2016 and 2017 for maize and the 10 year average sws did not differ between pm and ck at harvest stage significant differences in sws were only observed in 2018 for wheat and there were no significant differences in all years for maize between pm and ck fig 6 the average sws at harvesting stage did not differ for both wheat and maize the results suggested that sws at sowing and harvesting stages was not changed by pm but differed according to crop type and annual precipitation 3 4 effects of pm on crop et plastic mulching was previously found to inhibit evaporation and increase the ratio of transpiration and evaporation xie et al 2005 ren et al 2017 but did not significantly increase crop et hou et al 2014 wang and shangguan 2015 wang et al 2018 similarly in our study the 10 year field experimental results showed that pm on average increased et by 29 8 and 32 4 mm in wheat and maize fields respectively compared with ck but the differences were not significant fig 7 in 2012 2014 and 2016 for wheat and 2011 2013 and 2017 for maize the et was significantly higher for pm than ck this may depend on the precipitation temporal distribution and was not affected by pm zhao et al 2018a b reported that plastic mulching may generally change the atmospheric hydraulic process by significantly decreasing evaporation however our study showed that although pm inhibited evaporation the et was increased indicating that soil atmosphere water exchange was not inhibited 3 5 effects of pm on crop grain yield and wue the pm significantly increased grain yield of both wheat and maize over the 10 years with average increases of 65 2 and 148 4 respectively the effects were larger in drought years fig 8 previous reports showed similar results to our study xie et al 2005 li et al 2007 2013 hou et al 2014 ren et al 2017 gao et al 2018 the wue was also significantly increased by pm on average by 79 0 for wheat and 221 4 for maize fig 9 these results suggest that pm increased grain yield and wue in long term wheat and maize continuous cropping and its effects on these increments were stable and sustainable 3 6 effects of pm on rcv of grain yield and wue the rcv reflects the variation in grain yield and wue among the experimental years with lower rcv indicating higher stability of the agronomic production system the pm significantly decreased rcv of grain yield and wue for both maize and wheat for wheat pm decreased rcv of grain yield and wue by 48 3 and 47 2 respectively fig 10 a and c and the corresponding values for maize were 50 5 and 67 5 compared with ck fig 10b and d these suggested that pm mulching stably increased crop productivity in this semiarid rain fed area decreasing the risk of abiotic stresses to crop productivity 3 7 the quantitative relationships between crop yield and wue with et the grain yield of both wheat and maize showed a significant positive linear correlation with et significantly fig 10a b however in the regression equation between wheat grain yield and et the slope of pm was lower than ck while the slop of maize was opposite to that of wheat these suggested that the grain yield of maize was more sensitive to et as compared with wheat there was a significant negative linear correlation between wheat wue and et in pm fig 10c but had no significant correlation in ck however for maize the wue were positively correlated with et in both pm and ck fig 10 d and the slope of pm was lower than ck comprehensively this paper showed that long term pm significantly increased maize and wheat yield without increasing soil water consumption the pm improved soil water conditions for wheat but depleted deep soil water for maize compared with that at the sowing stage in 2010 this suggested that the soil water depletion was caused by the different crops not by pm in addition both maize yield and wue were positively linearly correlated with et either in pm or ck rather than positively with grain yield but wue was negatively linearly correlated with et at the wheat point indicating that the soil moisture could not meet maize demand in general and soil water was depleted in maize field fig 11 in fact pm relieved this depletion and so the soil water imbalance was not driven by in appropriate crop planting technology additionally pm stably increased crop yield and wue and is a promising way to sustain food security and increase farm income especially in this kind of semiarid area consequently plastic film should be treated like chemical fertilizer for agricultural productivity to conquer food shortages for the drier and more crowded future the future tasks is to focus on plastic material innovation produce environmental friendly film e g biodegradable and study planting technology appropriate to the regional natural resources especially precipitation keesstra et al 2018 4 conclusions the long term plastic mulching did not significantly affected soil water balance the deep soil water depletion occurred because the soil water could not meet the maize water requirement pm increased soil water storage by 58 8 mm in the 0 300 cm profile in wheat field but have no significant difference in maize field as compared with ck pm relieved the soil water shortage the dislocation of soil supply and crop demands by increasing rfe and significantly and stably increased crop yield and wue of wheat by 82 1 and 52 9 of maize by 148 4 and 139 9
