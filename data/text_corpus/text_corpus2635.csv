13175,hydrothermal carbonization htc can convert food waste into carbon fuel thus to provide renewable energy the wastewater derived from htc of food waste contains complex organic pollutants with a high cod value and low bod cod which is not feasible for direct anaerobic fermentation this work studied coagulation combined activated carbon ac adsorption to reduce the cod in htc wastewater to promote its biodegradability the experimental results indicated that poly aluminum ferric sulphate pafs and polyacrylamide pam are the optimal coagulant and coagulant aid respectively with the dosage for pafs pam and ac was 6 g l 10 mg l 30 g l respectively it can achieve 68 41 of the cod removal ratio and promote the transmittance of the wastewater from 23 to 89 xarthene carbamide ferulic acid and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma from the sediment were detected by x ray diffraction analysis xrd which proved the synergistic effect between coagulation and ac adsorption the typical pollutants in htc wastewater were reduced from 19 to 8 kinds after treatment bod cod ratio also increased from 0 30 in wastewater to 0 75 in liquid residual after treatment improved for subsequent biochemical treatment therefore the coagulation combined adsorption treatment is thought as a promising method in htc wastewater pretreatment and a possible prerequisite in the industrial utilization of food waste htc technology graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords food waste hydrothermal carbonization coagulation adsorption wastewater 1 introduction increasing biomass energy to replace fossil fuel is effective method for handling the challenge of climate change 1 2 hydrothermal carbonization htc can convert wet organic solid waste into high quality carbon fuel and it has attracted great attention recently 3 huge amount of food waste was produced during processing and consumption it is difficult to be treated for it contains highly wet components of oil organic matters and inorganic salt moisture 80 90 nacl 3 6 tec 4 5 the htc method has unparallel characteristics in rapid reaction utilizations of the products and low pollution emissions 3 htc of food waste would produce the solid and liquid phase in which the solid phase hydrochar can be used for further utilization 6 8 as for the liquid phase derived from htc also defined as htc wastewater which contains extensive organic pollutants n nh3 cl and metal ion such as ca2 na 6 chemical oxygen demand cod in htc wastewater is around 35 000 50 000 mg l so htc wastewater can cause immense contamination if it is discharged without proper treatment while its bod value is only about 10 000 15 000 mg l with a bod cod ratio of 0 2 0 35 so it is not feasible for direct digestion 6 furthermore it contained phenols aromatic hydrocarbon and long chain alkanes so it is difficult to be treated by simple biochemical method 9 10 it is essential to develop effective technology of htc wastewater treatment promoting the industrial utilization of the food waste htc technology coagulation is an efficient and economical method to reduce cod in wastewater 11 for it can form flocs to remove the colloids from the wastewater 12 coagulant dosage ph value of the wastewater temperature hydraulic condition can significantly influence the efficiency of the coagulation 13 14 for treating oil contaminated water inorganic coagulants polymeric ferric sulfate pfs poly aluminum sulfate pas and poly aluminum ferric sulphate pafs have proved to be efficient and economical 14 15 organic polymer coagulant like polyacrylamide pam can enhancing the bridging effect as the coagulant aid in coagulation 16 connect the fine flocs into a larger one 12 the addition amount of pam improves the coagulation treatment of oily wastewater with high cod value 5000 mg l cod removal ratio can be up to 97 17 20 the type and the dosage of the coagulant must be carefully considered because inappropriate coagulant selection and dosage could eventually have awful repercussions on the coagulation effect and even cause the raise of cod value 11 12 21 meanwhile adsorption is also a vital method in high polluted wastewater treatment 22 and the activated carbon ac has been widely applied 23 with a complicated porous structure ac shows magnificent characteristics in removing organic matters within the wastewater 12 24 ac adsorption can also be a potential solution in the high polluted wastewater treatment 25 27 cod reduction by ac adsorption can be up to 88 11 alternatively coagulation combined adsorption is a great option in sewage treatment 24 28 combining coagulation bridge effect and the multiple adsorptions of the ac the process has achieved more significant effect 29 31 by the addition of pafs with 120 mg l wastewater basis and ac with 6 g l it provided a significant cod remove ratio of 89 27 in the treatment of oily wastewater original cod value was 5000 mg l and the cod value after the treatment was 156 47 mg l 24 considering its excellent wastewater treatment capacity and low cost 32 the coagulation combined adsorption could be a potential solution in the wastewater treatment with high cod 33 34 this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of the coagulation combined ac adsorption to remove the cod of the wastewater derived from htc of food waste for increasing the bod cod ratio the specific objective of the study includes i determination of the optimal dosage for ac adsorption optimal coagulant type and dosage for coagulation and optimal ratio of coagulant adsorbent for coagulation combined adsorption ii comparison between different process method and explanation of mechanism iii analysis of the residual products from the optimal combination and provide potential utilization or possible guidance for subsequent treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 htc wastewater and materials the food waste was collected from a waste treatment center with the capacity of 200 t d in hangzhou china the moisture content of raw food waste was about 80 in order to ensure the duplication of experiment and the long period storage of sample so the food waste sample was dried in an oven 105 c and crushed into powder with the particle seize of 0 3 0 4 mm the characteristics of the food waste were listed in table 1 the htc procedure was carried out in a 1200 ml high pressure reactor adding the food waste powder and deionized water into the reactor at a mass ratio of 1 10 the type of the reactor was htr 300 7 it was manufactured by qingdao changlong chemical machinery corp ltd qingdao china then the reactor was strictly sealed and blew pure nitrogen into the reactor furnace to achieve oxygen free environment the temperature and pressure of htc reaction were settled at 250 c 4 1 mpa with a residence time of 30 min during the whole procedure the reactor was heated by an electric heater the electrical heater could achieve 250 c within 40 45 min after reaching the predetermined heating time the reactor was cooled to room temperature afterwards the reaction products were collected then separated the liquid phase with a vacuum filter which equipping a microporous membrane with the diameter of 0 45 Î¼m the liquid phase after the filtration was the wastewater of the food waste htc procedure the cod of the process were measure by a spectrophotometer uv 1100b shanghai ziqi laboratory equipment co ltd shanghai china the average value of htc wastewater was 41 825 mg l and the average ph measured by a precision ph meter was 7 34 the coagulant used in this research including polymeric ferric sulfate pfs poly aluminum sulfate pas poly aluminum ferric sulphate pafs and polyacrylamide pam were purchased from tengfei environmental protection cor ltd hangzhou china the ac used as the adsorbent in the research was purchased from lv zhi yuan carbon industry cor ltd guangzhou china 2 2 cod removal experiments the cod removal tests were carried out in beakers containing 50 ml of the wastewater the operation procedure for ac adsorption and coagulation were listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 for ac adsorption three stages of mixing with magnetic stir would be carried out after the ac were added to the beakers i the ac were added into the beakers they would be rapidly mixed with the wastewater under the stirring speed of 700 r min for 5 min 35 ii switched the stirring speed to 270 r min continue the process for 5 min to ensure the complete adsorption and promote the precipitation of the ac 11 iii ended up the stirring process and let the beakers stand in for 3 h as to guarantee all suspended solids had been settled as shown in table 2 for coagulation procedure three stages of mixing with magnetic stir would be carried out after the coagulants were added to the beakers i the coagulant were added into the beakers set the stirring speed as 600 r min for 5 min to promote dissolution and coagulation 17 ii switch the stirring speed to 240 r min continue the process for 5 min to accelerate the formation of flocs 12 to determine the optimal dosage of ac in ac adsorption different doses of ac from 0 2 g ml to 1 g ml were added to beakers in batches and carried out the ac adsorption stirring procedure in table 2 as the ph of the wastewater was 7 34 just in the best application range of coagulant 24 32 the coagulation experiment can be started without adjusting the ph of the wastewater the coagulation experiments were carried out in two steps a different coagulants pfs pas and pafs of the same amount according to previous pre test setting the initial addition amount as 4 g l were added to the different beakers to determine the coagulation with the most significant cod removal ratio for the further test b select the ideal coagulant with the best effect adding different doses of coagulant into the beakers to determine the best dosing quantity after the coagulants were added to the beakers the coagulation stirring procedure was carried out as it shown in table 2 the coagulation combined ac adsorption experiments were divided into the three stages the 1st stage was aim to research the best sequence of the adsorption and coagulation within the trail coagulant and adsorbent of the same quantity were added to the wastewater only changed the sequence of the coagulation and adsorption procedure series experiments were taken including combined adsorption coagulation method combined coagulation adsorption method and synchronized coagulation adsorption method the 2nd stage was settled to study the optimum ratio of coagulant and adsorbent coagulants adsorbent of different proportions were added to the wastewater the 3rd stage was designed to effect of coagulant aids pam on cod removal ratio 36 to determine the best ratio of coagulant aids and coagulant under the best proportion of coagulants adsorbent decided in the previous stage in each ac adsorption and coagulation procedure the stirring operation would be carried out after each dosing agent was added as it was shown in table 2 the cod and the ph of liquid samples were measured then compare to the relevant index of the original wastewater generally use the cod removal ratio as the main index of each trail then select the ideal group with the most significant cod removal ratio its deposition would be dried and preserved for sem and xrd analysis to judge its characteristics its liquid sample would be carried out for ftir analysis gc ms analysis transmittance measurements to measure its turbidity and bod measurements after the stirring procedure in each experiment the beakers would stand for 3 h the cod and the ph of different liquid samples were measured then compare to the relevant index of the original wastewater generally we took the cod removal ratio as the main index in judging the cod removing efficiency of each trail then select the ideal group with the most significant cod removal ratio collect its deposition and liquid phase and performed the tests mentioned before all the trails mentioned before were repeated for 3 times to avoid the accidental influence and measurement error 2 3 analysis method 2 3 1 liquid sample analysis the liquid sample analysis mainly consists of cod removal ratio analysis and ph value determination the ph value of each sample was measured by a precision ph meter the cod of the liquid sample from each group were measured by a spectrophotometer after the sample is oxidized by the digestion agent their cod values were measured at the wavelength of 630 nm generally the cod removal ratio Î· c was used as the main index to determine the cod removal efficiency in each trail the optimum experiment conditions were also decided by it the formula of cod removal ratio is eq 1 1 Î· c cod original cod final cod original 100 to determine the optimal dosage of the ac with highest adsorption efficiency we use average adsorption efficiency of the ac to evaluate the adsorption efficiency the formula of average adsorption efficiency is eq 2 2 Î· ac cod original cod final dosag e 100 to determine the treating cost in each trail we comprehensively evaluating the treating efficiency market price for each dosing agent and the dosage formula eq 3 showed the cost for removing every 1000 mg l cod in 1 l of the htc wastewater 3 removal cost market price dosage cod original cod 1000 the liquid sample from each optimum group in every stage of experiment was measured for bod analysis and transmittance test by a spectrophotometer fourier transformed infrared spectrophotometer ftir were used to identify the chemical bonds within the liquid sample from each optimal group the liquid sample from each optimal trail were collected and extracted by n hexane then been analyzed by gc ms system to determine the components within 2 3 2 deposition sample analysis the deposition from each optimum group in every stage of experiment were dried under 110 c for 12 h to get solid products the dried deposition were examined by x ray diffraction xrd panalytical x pert pro aimed to detect the crystal components within then wavelength dispersive xrf spectrometer thermo fisher scientific advant x 4200 were used to determine the relative element within the samples scanning electron microscopy sem were also used to inspect the compositions of the samples fig 1 3 results and discussions 3 1 adsorption effect of ac fig 2 displayed the cod removal ratio and the average cod removal efficiency with same ac dose by ac adsorption from 20 g l to 100 g l of ac dosage also marked the cod values of the liquid sample from different groups it could be observed that the cod removal ratio rising as the increasing dosage of ac it can be observed the group with the adsorbent addition amount of 30 g l cod removal ratio is 28 48 had the most significant cod removal efficiency compared to the other trails the findings were consistent with the previous work 25 27 35 37 38 after adsorption and precipitation process obvious stratification can be witnessed most ac depositions at the bottom of the beakers and the liquid phase of each group are relatively clear compared to the original wastewater the transmittance of the liquid sample after the treatment was promoted to 68 from 23 the following experiments chose 30 g l as the optimal addition amount for the ac adsorption for the ac adsorption had the highest cod removal efficiency with this dosage and could also improve the economy of the whole process 3 2 coagulation effect 3 2 1 determination of the optimal coagulant in order to facilitate the follow up tests it is necessary to select the ideal coagulant in table 3 the cod removal ratio of three coagulants including pas pfs and pafs were displayed with the same dosage of 2 g l pfs has the maximum cod removal ratio 14 94 followed by pafs 13 45 while pas proved to have little effect in this trail after the coagulation process with pfs the liquid sample appeared to be darker and had smaller flocs settled on the bottom of the beaker compared to other groups and the transmittance of the liquid sample was lower this phenomenon also was indicated by lee 18 for the iron ion have reactions with colored colloids within the wastewater then the liquid sample appeared dark color with the dissolved matter generated by the process 39 41 considering this characteristic of the pfs aimed to achieve better coagulation effect with low cost 42 43 and clearer liquid phase pafs was chose as the ideal coagulant for the following experiment 3 2 2 determination of the optimal dosage of pafs the following experiments discussed different pafs addition amount focused on the investigation towards the optimal pafs dosage the specific data and results of the experiments are shown in the fig 3 compared to the curves drawn with the cod removal ratio in the previous ac adsorption experiment this cod removal curve showed an evident peak the removal ratio continuously increased as the pafs addition amount increases till 6 g l the highest removal ratio with 26 is reached after that the coagulation effect gradually becomes worse with the increase of coagulants while add pafs to the wastewater as the amount of 10 g l the cod value of the liquid sample in this group was even slightly higher than the original wastewater before the coagulation procedure this observation demonstrated the thesis about the coagulation mechanism mentioned in the other works 24 39 44 with the uneven distributions of the hetero charges certain electrostatic attraction was created between particular organic particles within the wastewater causing the zeta potential unequal to zero in such way as to form the flocs between the colloids 36 with various addition amount of the coagulation the zeta potential could various between a certain range within the range the coagulation can provide satisfying coagulation effect a large amount of the colloids changed into flocs and finally become solid sediment and separated from the wastewater then the cod value of the wastewater is reduced 11 this phenomenon is also described as the coagulation window the peak of the cod removal curve 6 g l represented the optimal condition in the coagulation treatment of the htc wastewater and 4 g l 8 g l formed an ideal coagulation window outside this range with excess coagulant addition amount the colloidal destabilization occurs and affected the coagulation effect leads to the reduction of cod removal ratio while adding much more coagulants 10 g l due to the strong solubility of pafs the excess fe3 al3 and so4 2 contained by the pafs become part of solute in the wastewater which can trigger the colloidal re stabilization the original colloid with negative charge in water is changed into colloid with positive charge re stabilize the colloid and avoid the sediment of the colloids and finally cause the repercussion that the cod removal effect of the liquid samples in this group 10 g l is even weakened comparing to the original wastewater the transmittance of liquid sample treated by pafs at a dosage of 6 g l was promoted to 39 after coagulation from 23 after the comprehensive considerations on the selection of optimal coagulants and best dosage take cod removal ratio as the main factor in the evaluation of the coagulation effect it is prudence to think that the pafs is the optimal coagulant in the coagulation treatment of the wastewater and the ultimate ideal dosage is 6 g l furthermore the following trails would select the pafs in every coagulation procedure 3 3 effect of coagulation combined ac adsorption 3 3 1 discussion about ideal processing sequence table 4 displayed the cod values and the cod removal ratio from different trail groups which had been processed by various processing sequence including combined adsorption coagulation cac method combined coagulation adsorption method cca and synchronized coagulation adsorption sca method as is mentioned in the previous coagulation analysis pafs was chose as the target coagulant and the addition amount was 6 g l the addition amount of the ac was 30 g l compared with the other two process methods the cac method had a poor performance on the cod removal ratio only 14 68 alternatively the cfc method and the sca shared a similar performance on the cod removal ratio while cca method still had a slightly better cod removing efficiency than sca method hence the findings clearly demonstrated the hypothesis on the synergistic effect in the coagulation combined ac adsorption 36 45 while the coagulation process removed the organic macromolecules through forming flocs which insoluble in wastewater and became depositions the ac mainly adsorbed the organic micro molecules with its porous structure therefore the cod value of the wastewater decreased as the organic matters within had been reduced 45 in sca method porous structure promoted the contract area between the coagulant and the wastewater reduced the compliance within the process and provided structures for the formation of the flocs 36 thus achieved a better effect than flocculent and the adsorbent acted separately as for the caf method this synergistic effect performed a weaker coordination compared the sfa method the interval between the adsorption and coagulation procedure reduced this auxiliary effect which decisively displayed an unsatisfying repercussion 37 46 47 the cca method displayed another type of synergy effect through forming floc grids coagulants triggered the sweeping effect within the reaction which accelerated the formation of flocs with larger size 37 also the addition of the coagulation changed the density of the wastewater and strength the netting mechanism 24 combined with the advantages all above promoted the adsorption and sediment effect of the ac adsorption procedure which eventually provided much better treating effect than the individual procedure of the coagulation and adsorption it can therefore be inferred that combined coagulation adsorption method which literally means using ac adsorption after the coagulation is the optimal method in the cod removal of wastewater hence we have chosen this method in the following trails 3 3 2 discussion about optimal ratio of coagulant to adsorbent fig 4 displayed the cod values and the cod removal ratio of various trails while fixing the addition amount of ac as 30 g l the ratios of coagulant to absorbent by adding pafs with various quantities were changed taking the quantity of pafs as x axis coordinate a significant peak on the cod removal ratio curve can be observed while the pafs dosage is below 6 g l the cod of the liquid samples reduced as the dosage raises then reach the peak at around 6 g l and achieve the maximum cod removal ratio of 44 04 afterwards when the addition amount is in the range of 6 12 g l the cod removal ratio decreased as the dosage of pafs increased in the view of the ratio of coagulant to adsorbent when the pafs dosage was 6 g l and the ac dosage was 30 g l the coagulation combined ac adsorption had the highest cod removal ratio which means the optimal ratio of pafs to ac is 0 2 the data strongly demonstrated the previous thesis on the synergistic effect in the coagulation combined ac adsorption by enhancing the netting mechanism and sweeping effect by forming flocs the adsorption efficiency was promoted as for the negative correlation of the cod removal ratio and the pafs addition amount in the range of 6 12 g l the fact perfectly accords with the coagulation window thesis as the excess coagulant had been added into the wastewater the excess inorganic salt ion from the coagulant could become part of solute in the wastewater 23 which can trigger the colloidal re stabilization then the original colloid with negative charge in water is changed into colloid with positive charge re stabilize the colloid and avoid the sediment of the colloids and eventually led to this repercussion the transmittance of the liquid sample after the treatment was promoted to 79 after treated by the coagulation combined adsorption in optimal dosage 6 g l 30 g l took prudence attitude towards the statistics from the previous experiments and considered the current findings comprehensively evaluating economy treating efficiency and sustainability we chose 0 2 as the optimal ratio of the coagulant and absorbent for the following trails which means the dosage for the pafs and ac was 6 g l and 30 g l 3 3 3 research on optimal dosage of coagulant aid pam was used as the coagulant aid and adjusted the ratio between pam and pafs by changing the addition amount of pam fig 5 provided vivid results of the trail groups in the experiment on deciding the optimal dosage of the coagulant aid based on the previous experiments the dosage of the pafs and ac were fixed as 6 g l and 30 g l which had the optimal ratio of coagulant to adsorbent and changing the addition amount of pam the cod value of the liquid samples from each trail groups were measured then drew the cod removal curve with the preset evaluation formula within the figure a significant peak on the cod removal ratio can be observed as the pam addition amount was 10 mg l the removal ratio reached 68 41 which is far better than any other previous treating sequence the results perfectly demonstrated with the previous thesis while using pam as coagulant aid for pafs in coagulation the long chain organic macromolecules within pam promoted the sweeping and bridging effect with the uneven distributions of the hetero charges certain electrostatic attraction was created between particular organic particles within the wastewater causing the zeta potential unequal to zero in such way as to form more flocs between the colloids and accelerated the coagulation process 36 with various addition amount of the coagulant aid the zeta potential could various between a certain range within the range the coagulant aid has a strong promoting effect on the coagulation process when excess coagulant was added in the wastewater it would affect the electric neutralization and the colloidal destabilization occurs thus the bridging and sweeping effect continuously weakened 40 48 51 as for the adsorption procedure coagulant aid enhanced the netting mechanism and sweeping effect by forming flocs 46 hence the adsorption efficiency was promoted appendix a b presented vivified results of the wastewater treated with different addition amount of the coagulant aid it can be clearly observed the excellent effect after the coagulation combined adsorption in the view of whole picture the addition of pam significantly enhanced the precipitation the liquid samples had clearer appearance compared to other procedures the transmittance of the liquid sample after the treatment was promoted to 89 from 23 considering various implications indicated in the current findings comprehensively evaluating economy treating efficiency and sustainability at the end of day it can be assumed that 10 mg l is the ideal dosage for the pam in the coagulation combined ac adsorption the optimal dosage for pafs pam and ac was 6 g l 10 mg l 30 g l which can achieve a removal ratio of 68 41 in the wastewater original cod value is 41 825 from food waste htc 3 4 analysis of the deposition from the optimal group 3 4 1 xrd analysis fig 6 displayed the xrd patterns of the depositions from every optimal group fig 6 a represented the xrd patterns for the deposition collected from the ac adsorption it can be uncovered the spectrum that the main components adsorbed by the ac were trioxane amino and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma fig 6 b represented the xrd patterns for the deposition collected from the pafs coagulation which was mainly consists of anthrone ferulic acid and compounds calcium through forming flocs fig 6 c presented the xrd patterns for the pafs combined ac adsorption process xarthene carbamide ferulic acid and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma were detected from the sediment fig 6 d presented the xrd patterns for coagulant aided coagulation combined adsorption process xarthene troxane ferulic acid and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma were detected from the sediment these findings clearly demonstrated the previous results 7 32 52 the ac adsorption and coagulation procedure removed various organic pollutants in the wastewater by different mechanisms 53 when treating the wastewater with coagulation combined adsorption procedure which trigger synergy effect through forming floc grids coagulants triggered the sweeping effect within the reaction then accelerated the formation of flocs hence more organic and inorganic pollutants has been detected from the sediment as it was shown in fig 6 d with the bridging effect of the coagulant aid more organic and inorganic pollutants were fixed within the deposition demonstrated the coagulant aided coagulation combined ac adsorption has the highest cod removal ratio 3 4 2 sem patterns fig 7 provided sem images of the sediments collected from each optimal trail from low magnification images it could be easily observed that the ac was the main content displayed in the figure in high magnification images the micropores on the surfaces of the ac could be clearly observed which demonstrated that the high adsorption ability was caused by its high specific surface and extensively micropore structure 11 24 compared to fig 7 a the micropores of the ac from fig 7 b c adsorbed much more surface groups the findings further demonstrated the synergy effect in coagulation combined ac adsorption through forming floc grids coagulants triggered the sweeping effect within the reaction which accelerated the formation of flocs with larger size 3 5 analysis of the liquid sample from optimal group 3 5 1 functional group analysis by ftir the ftir analysis uncovered the chemical bonds within the original htc wastewater and the liquid samples after all optimal treating methods in fig 8 a the miscellaneous peak between 4000 3500 cm 1 demonstrated the existence of water within the original htc wastewater the patterns between 2000 2200 cm 1 stood for the overtone spectrum for aromatic hydrocarbon the peak between 1400 1300 cm 1 demonstrated the existence of ch groups in fig 8 a d the peak between 3000 3400 cm 1 represented the stretching vibration of hydroxyl the curve between 2500 and 3000 cm 1 represented for the existence of methylene 54 and the peak between 1500 1650 cm 1 gave significant reflection on the existence of cc structure and aromatic rings 55 the following findings clearly demonstrated the previous results while the pretreatment cannot remove cod which means there remained some pollutants within water further discussion on gc ms analysis would gave more specific results on the organic pollutants removed within the process 3 5 2 organic compound analysis by gc ms the original wastewater and the liquid samples collected from various trails were measured by gc ms and the results are listed in fig 9 the comparisons of different treating methods with the original htc wastewater were shown in fig 9 a c and the ion current of all treating methods was displayed in fig 9 d the original htc wastewater contained a great number of organic pollutants and the typical pollutants within the htc wastewater were listed in table 5 roughly contained 19 typical organic pollutants including phenols hydrocarbons esters and amines 56 the result displayed in gc ms ion current figures was consistent with the results shown in ftir analysis the organic pollutants detected in the liquid phase contained complex organic macromolecules which had a long molecular chain as it is shown in fig 9 a the ac adsorption could have a significant removal effect on the phenols alkanes and esters and the number of the typical pollutants reduced to 10 kinds and the adsorption procedure also had a significant removal effect on long chain macromolecules like c26 c30 alkanes the findings demonstrated the fact that the adsorption capacity of ac was determined by the surface properties molecule characteristics competitions between different components and particle structure 24 while gc ms images uncovered the high content of the phenols and alkanes the phenols and some alkanes detected and listed in table 5 could be easily been adsorbed by the ac since their diameters were smaller than the pore size of the ac thus they could easily enter the inside body of the ac the Ï Ï hypothesis focus on the Ï Ï dispersion interaction 57 the certain reactions were taken place between the Ï electron between aromatic rings and activated partial graphite layers 23 45 57 as for long chain macromolecule alkanes the adsorption procedure seemed to have a weaker effect for the diameters of those alkanes were larger than the pore size of the ac and limited the adsorption effect but the adsorption procedure could have a better adsorption effect on the long chain alkanes with higher molecular weight for the intermolecular van der waals force raised as the molecular weight raised 58 59 in this way the ac adsorption could have a significant cod removal effect on htc wastewater the fig 9 b provided the total ion current image of coagulation combined ac adsorption procedure compared to fig 9 a the coagulation procedure could greatly improve the removal effect on the long chain macromolecules like c21 c30 alkanes also reduced the contents of phenols within the liquid samples hence the number of the typical pollutants were decreased to 9 kinds the long chain macromolecule alkanes which could trigger the sweep effect and been removed by forming floc in the coagulation procedure 60 were removed for about 43 within the process as in fig 9 c with the addition of coagulant aid the long chain organic macromolecules within pam promoted the sweeping and bridging effect with the uneven distributions of the hetero charges certain electrostatic attraction was created between particular organic particles within the wastewater causing the zeta potential unequal to zero in such way as to form more flocs between the colloids and accelerated the coagulation process 36 in this mechanism the long chain alkanes and phenols were removed by forming flocs thus the typical pollutants were reduced to 8 kinds the findings clearly demonstrated that the coagulation combined ac adsorption and pam aided coagulation combined ac adsorption could have a significant cod removal effect on htc wastewater while more than 70 of long chain alkanes and most of the phenols were removed the increase of the intensity between 5 7 5 min was caused by the deposition of pam in the solution and turned into acrylamide 54 which could promote the biodegradability of the wastewater for the acrylamide was easy to be composed by the microorganisms 3 5 3 bod analysis of the liquid sample from the optimal groups table 6 displayed the bod values and bod cod ratio of the liquid sample from the optimal groups the bod cod ratio generally reflects the biochemical index of the samples which provides vital references for the following biochemical treatment of the samples studies had proved that when the bod cod ratio is between 0 3 0 5 so the current water will be suitable for anaerobic fermentation treatment 45 as the bod cod ratio is over 0 5 the liquid samples would be typically suitable for biochemical treatment as it is showed in table 6 the ac adsorption process approximately raised the bod cod ratio for 0 077 compared to the original wastewater which greatly promoted the potential for further biochemical treatment comprehensively considering the conclusions in gc ms and ftir analysis the adsorption procedure reduced the phenols aromatic hydrocarbon and certain long chain alkanes which could be harmful for the aerobic fermentation and eventually promote the biodegradability of the wastewater those refractory organics had a bod cod ratio at around 0 03 0 17 61 63 the coagulation and adsorption procedure had been demonstrated to significantly remove those refractory organics which explained that the decrease of bod was less than the decrease of cod the pafs coagulation combined ac adsorption further raised the bod cod ratio for 0 155 achieved 0 451 by removing inorganic compounds and organic matter within the liquid samples through forming flocs and adsorption hence the wastewater was clearly suitable for biochemical treatment after this procedure with the addition of pam the bod cod ratio raised to 0 750 it could be inferred from the gc ms and ftir results that the addition of this organic coagulant greatly removed a large number of long chain alkanes phenols aromatic hydrocarbon which could hardly be oxidative decomposed in anaerobic fermentation 9 the negative effect of the long chain alkanes to the anaerobic fermentation could attribute the toxicity of these alkanes to cell membranes so as to inhibit the growth of bacteria 64 67 and gc ms images also proved that the remaining pam in the solution have decomposed into acrylamide which had a bod cod ratio over 0 97 68 69 hence increase the bod value and greatly promoted the biodegradability of the wastewater also explained that the cod value decreased greatly after the pam treatment while bod value had a mild change comparing all three treating methods the bod values of each trail had a mild change comparing to the changes in cod values this clearly demonstrated the conclusions in ftir and gc ms analysis that most refractory organic pollutants aromatic hydrocarbon alkanes and phenols were removed within the treating process while the contents of biodegradable substrate had smaller changes within the process 4 conclusions the results and observations listed in this research indicated the importance of selecting the suitable coagulants and adsorbent determining optimal dosage ratio and treating sequence in the treatment of wastewater from food waste htc the general conclusions are extracted as following 1 the study has identified pafs and ac is the ideal coagulant and adsorbent in the combined coagulation and adsorption process as the optimal treatment process is combined coagulation adsorption when the dosage for pafs and ac is 6 g l and 30 g l it can achieve 44 04 of the cod removal ratio reduced cod from 41 825 mg l to 23 825 mg l 2 the study demonstrated the coagulation combined ac adsorption has synergistic effect which enhances the netting mechanism and sweeping effect by forming flocs the adsorption efficiency was promoted and eventually promoted the cod removal ratio of the wastewater than other individual procedures 3 furthermore using pam as coagulant of the coagulation can increase the cod removal ratio with the addition of pam in the dosage is 10 mg l it can achieve 68 41 of the cod removal ratio indicated the sweeping and bridging effect of pam as coagulant aid 4 by analyzing the sediment with sem it was demonstrated the adsorption effect of ac micropores furthermore it was indicated that xarthene carbamide ferulic acid and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma were detected from the sediment of coagulation combined adsorption in xrd analysis which proved the synergistic effect of the coagulation combined ac adsorption within this treating process 5 ftir and gc ms analysis proved that the coagulation combined ac adsorption could greatly reduce the number of organic pollutants within the htc wastewater from 19 to 9 kinds additionally within the addition of pam as the coagulant aid the typical organic pollutants could be reduced to 8 kinds 6 by measuring the bod values from each optimal group and calculating the bod cod ratio by removing a large number refectory organics it was proved that the coagulation combined

13175,hydrothermal carbonization htc can convert food waste into carbon fuel thus to provide renewable energy the wastewater derived from htc of food waste contains complex organic pollutants with a high cod value and low bod cod which is not feasible for direct anaerobic fermentation this work studied coagulation combined activated carbon ac adsorption to reduce the cod in htc wastewater to promote its biodegradability the experimental results indicated that poly aluminum ferric sulphate pafs and polyacrylamide pam are the optimal coagulant and coagulant aid respectively with the dosage for pafs pam and ac was 6 g l 10 mg l 30 g l respectively it can achieve 68 41 of the cod removal ratio and promote the transmittance of the wastewater from 23 to 89 xarthene carbamide ferulic acid and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma from the sediment were detected by x ray diffraction analysis xrd which proved the synergistic effect between coagulation and ac adsorption the typical pollutants in htc wastewater were reduced from 19 to 8 kinds after treatment bod cod ratio also increased from 0 30 in wastewater to 0 75 in liquid residual after treatment improved for subsequent biochemical treatment therefore the coagulation combined adsorption treatment is thought as a promising method in htc wastewater pretreatment and a possible prerequisite in the industrial utilization of food waste htc technology graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords food waste hydrothermal carbonization coagulation adsorption wastewater 1 introduction increasing biomass energy to replace fossil fuel is effective method for handling the challenge of climate change 1 2 hydrothermal carbonization htc can convert wet organic solid waste into high quality carbon fuel and it has attracted great attention recently 3 huge amount of food waste was produced during processing and consumption it is difficult to be treated for it contains highly wet components of oil organic matters and inorganic salt moisture 80 90 nacl 3 6 tec 4 5 the htc method has unparallel characteristics in rapid reaction utilizations of the products and low pollution emissions 3 htc of food waste would produce the solid and liquid phase in which the solid phase hydrochar can be used for further utilization 6 8 as for the liquid phase derived from htc also defined as htc wastewater which contains extensive organic pollutants n nh3 cl and metal ion such as ca2 na 6 chemical oxygen demand cod in htc wastewater is around 35 000 50 000 mg l so htc wastewater can cause immense contamination if it is discharged without proper treatment while its bod value is only about 10 000 15 000 mg l with a bod cod ratio of 0 2 0 35 so it is not feasible for direct digestion 6 furthermore it contained phenols aromatic hydrocarbon and long chain alkanes so it is difficult to be treated by simple biochemical method 9 10 it is essential to develop effective technology of htc wastewater treatment promoting the industrial utilization of the food waste htc technology coagulation is an efficient and economical method to reduce cod in wastewater 11 for it can form flocs to remove the colloids from the wastewater 12 coagulant dosage ph value of the wastewater temperature hydraulic condition can significantly influence the efficiency of the coagulation 13 14 for treating oil contaminated water inorganic coagulants polymeric ferric sulfate pfs poly aluminum sulfate pas and poly aluminum ferric sulphate pafs have proved to be efficient and economical 14 15 organic polymer coagulant like polyacrylamide pam can enhancing the bridging effect as the coagulant aid in coagulation 16 connect the fine flocs into a larger one 12 the addition amount of pam improves the coagulation treatment of oily wastewater with high cod value 5000 mg l cod removal ratio can be up to 97 17 20 the type and the dosage of the coagulant must be carefully considered because inappropriate coagulant selection and dosage could eventually have awful repercussions on the coagulation effect and even cause the raise of cod value 11 12 21 meanwhile adsorption is also a vital method in high polluted wastewater treatment 22 and the activated carbon ac has been widely applied 23 with a complicated porous structure ac shows magnificent characteristics in removing organic matters within the wastewater 12 24 ac adsorption can also be a potential solution in the high polluted wastewater treatment 25 27 cod reduction by ac adsorption can be up to 88 11 alternatively coagulation combined adsorption is a great option in sewage treatment 24 28 combining coagulation bridge effect and the multiple adsorptions of the ac the process has achieved more significant effect 29 31 by the addition of pafs with 120 mg l wastewater basis and ac with 6 g l it provided a significant cod remove ratio of 89 27 in the treatment of oily wastewater original cod value was 5000 mg l and the cod value after the treatment was 156 47 mg l 24 considering its excellent wastewater treatment capacity and low cost 32 the coagulation combined adsorption could be a potential solution in the wastewater treatment with high cod 33 34 this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of the coagulation combined ac adsorption to remove the cod of the wastewater derived from htc of food waste for increasing the bod cod ratio the specific objective of the study includes i determination of the optimal dosage for ac adsorption optimal coagulant type and dosage for coagulation and optimal ratio of coagulant adsorbent for coagulation combined adsorption ii comparison between different process method and explanation of mechanism iii analysis of the residual products from the optimal combination and provide potential utilization or possible guidance for subsequent treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 htc wastewater and materials the food waste was collected from a waste treatment center with the capacity of 200 t d in hangzhou china the moisture content of raw food waste was about 80 in order to ensure the duplication of experiment and the long period storage of sample so the food waste sample was dried in an oven 105 c and crushed into powder with the particle seize of 0 3 0 4 mm the characteristics of the food waste were listed in table 1 the htc procedure was carried out in a 1200 ml high pressure reactor adding the food waste powder and deionized water into the reactor at a mass ratio of 1 10 the type of the reactor was htr 300 7 it was manufactured by qingdao changlong chemical machinery corp ltd qingdao china then the reactor was strictly sealed and blew pure nitrogen into the reactor furnace to achieve oxygen free environment the temperature and pressure of htc reaction were settled at 250 c 4 1 mpa with a residence time of 30 min during the whole procedure the reactor was heated by an electric heater the electrical heater could achieve 250 c within 40 45 min after reaching the predetermined heating time the reactor was cooled to room temperature afterwards the reaction products were collected then separated the liquid phase with a vacuum filter which equipping a microporous membrane with the diameter of 0 45 Î¼m the liquid phase after the filtration was the wastewater of the food waste htc procedure the cod of the process were measure by a spectrophotometer uv 1100b shanghai ziqi laboratory equipment co ltd shanghai china the average value of htc wastewater was 41 825 mg l and the average ph measured by a precision ph meter was 7 34 the coagulant used in this research including polymeric ferric sulfate pfs poly aluminum sulfate pas poly aluminum ferric sulphate pafs and polyacrylamide pam were purchased from tengfei environmental protection cor ltd hangzhou china the ac used as the adsorbent in the research was purchased from lv zhi yuan carbon industry cor ltd guangzhou china 2 2 cod removal experiments the cod removal tests were carried out in beakers containing 50 ml of the wastewater the operation procedure for ac adsorption and coagulation were listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 for ac adsorption three stages of mixing with magnetic stir would be carried out after the ac were added to the beakers i the ac were added into the beakers they would be rapidly mixed with the wastewater under the stirring speed of 700 r min for 5 min 35 ii switched the stirring speed to 270 r min continue the process for 5 min to ensure the complete adsorption and promote the precipitation of the ac 11 iii ended up the stirring process and let the beakers stand in for 3 h as to guarantee all suspended solids had been settled as shown in table 2 for coagulation procedure three stages of mixing with magnetic stir would be carried out after the coagulants were added to the beakers i the coagulant were added into the beakers set the stirring speed as 600 r min for 5 min to promote dissolution and coagulation 17 ii switch the stirring speed to 240 r min continue the process for 5 min to accelerate the formation of flocs 12 to determine the optimal dosage of ac in ac adsorption different doses of ac from 0 2 g ml to 1 g ml were added to beakers in batches and carried out the ac adsorption stirring procedure in table 2 as the ph of the wastewater was 7 34 just in the best application range of coagulant 24 32 the coagulation experiment can be started without adjusting the ph of the wastewater the coagulation experiments were carried out in two steps a different coagulants pfs pas and pafs of the same amount according to previous pre test setting the initial addition amount as 4 g l were added to the different beakers to determine the coagulation with the most significant cod removal ratio for the further test b select the ideal coagulant with the best effect adding different doses of coagulant into the beakers to determine the best dosing quantity after the coagulants were added to the beakers the coagulation stirring procedure was carried out as it shown in table 2 the coagulation combined ac adsorption experiments were divided into the three stages the 1st stage was aim to research the best sequence of the adsorption and coagulation within the trail coagulant and adsorbent of the same quantity were added to the wastewater only changed the sequence of the coagulation and adsorption procedure series experiments were taken including combined adsorption coagulation method combined coagulation adsorption method and synchronized coagulation adsorption method the 2nd stage was settled to study the optimum ratio of coagulant and adsorbent coagulants adsorbent of different proportions were added to the wastewater the 3rd stage was designed to effect of coagulant aids pam on cod removal ratio 36 to determine the best ratio of coagulant aids and coagulant under the best proportion of coagulants adsorbent decided in the previous stage in each ac adsorption and coagulation procedure the stirring operation would be carried out after each dosing agent was added as it was shown in table 2 the cod and the ph of liquid samples were measured then compare to the relevant index of the original wastewater generally use the cod removal ratio as the main index of each trail then select the ideal group with the most significant cod removal ratio its deposition would be dried and preserved for sem and xrd analysis to judge its characteristics its liquid sample would be carried out for ftir analysis gc ms analysis transmittance measurements to measure its turbidity and bod measurements after the stirring procedure in each experiment the beakers would stand for 3 h the cod and the ph of different liquid samples were measured then compare to the relevant index of the original wastewater generally we took the cod removal ratio as the main index in judging the cod removing efficiency of each trail then select the ideal group with the most significant cod removal ratio collect its deposition and liquid phase and performed the tests mentioned before all the trails mentioned before were repeated for 3 times to avoid the accidental influence and measurement error 2 3 analysis method 2 3 1 liquid sample analysis the liquid sample analysis mainly consists of cod removal ratio analysis and ph value determination the ph value of each sample was measured by a precision ph meter the cod of the liquid sample from each group were measured by a spectrophotometer after the sample is oxidized by the digestion agent their cod values were measured at the wavelength of 630 nm generally the cod removal ratio Î· c was used as the main index to determine the cod removal efficiency in each trail the optimum experiment conditions were also decided by it the formula of cod removal ratio is eq 1 1 Î· c cod original cod final cod original 100 to determine the optimal dosage of the ac with highest adsorption efficiency we use average adsorption efficiency of the ac to evaluate the adsorption efficiency the formula of average adsorption efficiency is eq 2 2 Î· ac cod original cod final dosag e 100 to determine the treating cost in each trail we comprehensively evaluating the treating efficiency market price for each dosing agent and the dosage formula eq 3 showed the cost for removing every 1000 mg l cod in 1 l of the htc wastewater 3 removal cost market price dosage cod original cod 1000 the liquid sample from each optimum group in every stage of experiment was measured for bod analysis and transmittance test by a spectrophotometer fourier transformed infrared spectrophotometer ftir were used to identify the chemical bonds within the liquid sample from each optimal group the liquid sample from each optimal trail were collected and extracted by n hexane then been analyzed by gc ms system to determine the components within 2 3 2 deposition sample analysis the deposition from each optimum group in every stage of experiment were dried under 110 c for 12 h to get solid products the dried deposition were examined by x ray diffraction xrd panalytical x pert pro aimed to detect the crystal components within then wavelength dispersive xrf spectrometer thermo fisher scientific advant x 4200 were used to determine the relative element within the samples scanning electron microscopy sem were also used to inspect the compositions of the samples fig 1 3 results and discussions 3 1 adsorption effect of ac fig 2 displayed the cod removal ratio and the average cod removal efficiency with same ac dose by ac adsorption from 20 g l to 100 g l of ac dosage also marked the cod values of the liquid sample from different groups it could be observed that the cod removal ratio rising as the increasing dosage of ac it can be observed the group with the adsorbent addition amount of 30 g l cod removal ratio is 28 48 had the most significant cod removal efficiency compared to the other trails the findings were consistent with the previous work 25 27 35 37 38 after adsorption and precipitation process obvious stratification can be witnessed most ac depositions at the bottom of the beakers and the liquid phase of each group are relatively clear compared to the original wastewater the transmittance of the liquid sample after the treatment was promoted to 68 from 23 the following experiments chose 30 g l as the optimal addition amount for the ac adsorption for the ac adsorption had the highest cod removal efficiency with this dosage and could also improve the economy of the whole process 3 2 coagulation effect 3 2 1 determination of the optimal coagulant in order to facilitate the follow up tests it is necessary to select the ideal coagulant in table 3 the cod removal ratio of three coagulants including pas pfs and pafs were displayed with the same dosage of 2 g l pfs has the maximum cod removal ratio 14 94 followed by pafs 13 45 while pas proved to have little effect in this trail after the coagulation process with pfs the liquid sample appeared to be darker and had smaller flocs settled on the bottom of the beaker compared to other groups and the transmittance of the liquid sample was lower this phenomenon also was indicated by lee 18 for the iron ion have reactions with colored colloids within the wastewater then the liquid sample appeared dark color with the dissolved matter generated by the process 39 41 considering this characteristic of the pfs aimed to achieve better coagulation effect with low cost 42 43 and clearer liquid phase pafs was chose as the ideal coagulant for the following experiment 3 2 2 determination of the optimal dosage of pafs the following experiments discussed different pafs addition amount focused on the investigation towards the optimal pafs dosage the specific data and results of the experiments are shown in the fig 3 compared to the curves drawn with the cod removal ratio in the previous ac adsorption experiment this cod removal curve showed an evident peak the removal ratio continuously increased as the pafs addition amount increases till 6 g l the highest removal ratio with 26 is reached after that the coagulation effect gradually becomes worse with the increase of coagulants while add pafs to the wastewater as the amount of 10 g l the cod value of the liquid sample in this group was even slightly higher than the original wastewater before the coagulation procedure this observation demonstrated the thesis about the coagulation mechanism mentioned in the other works 24 39 44 with the uneven distributions of the hetero charges certain electrostatic attraction was created between particular organic particles within the wastewater causing the zeta potential unequal to zero in such way as to form the flocs between the colloids 36 with various addition amount of the coagulation the zeta potential could various between a certain range within the range the coagulation can provide satisfying coagulation effect a large amount of the colloids changed into flocs and finally become solid sediment and separated from the wastewater then the cod value of the wastewater is reduced 11 this phenomenon is also described as the coagulation window the peak of the cod removal curve 6 g l represented the optimal condition in the coagulation treatment of the htc wastewater and 4 g l 8 g l formed an ideal coagulation window outside this range with excess coagulant addition amount the colloidal destabilization occurs and affected the coagulation effect leads to the reduction of cod removal ratio while adding much more coagulants 10 g l due to the strong solubility of pafs the excess fe3 al3 and so4 2 contained by the pafs become part of solute in the wastewater which can trigger the colloidal re stabilization the original colloid with negative charge in water is changed into colloid with positive charge re stabilize the colloid and avoid the sediment of the colloids and finally cause the repercussion that the cod removal effect of the liquid samples in this group 10 g l is even weakened comparing to the original wastewater the transmittance of liquid sample treated by pafs at a dosage of 6 g l was promoted to 39 after coagulation from 23 after the comprehensive considerations on the selection of optimal coagulants and best dosage take cod removal ratio as the main factor in the evaluation of the coagulation effect it is prudence to think that the pafs is the optimal coagulant in the coagulation treatment of the wastewater and the ultimate ideal dosage is 6 g l furthermore the following trails would select the pafs in every coagulation procedure 3 3 effect of coagulation combined ac adsorption 3 3 1 discussion about ideal processing sequence table 4 displayed the cod values and the cod removal ratio from different trail groups which had been processed by various processing sequence including combined adsorption coagulation cac method combined coagulation adsorption method cca and synchronized coagulation adsorption sca method as is mentioned in the previous coagulation analysis pafs was chose as the target coagulant and the addition amount was 6 g l the addition amount of the ac was 30 g l compared with the other two process methods the cac method had a poor performance on the cod removal ratio only 14 68 alternatively the cfc method and the sca shared a similar performance on the cod removal ratio while cca method still had a slightly better cod removing efficiency than sca method hence the findings clearly demonstrated the hypothesis on the synergistic effect in the coagulation combined ac adsorption 36 45 while the coagulation process removed the organic macromolecules through forming flocs which insoluble in wastewater and became depositions the ac mainly adsorbed the organic micro molecules with its porous structure therefore the cod value of the wastewater decreased as the organic matters within had been reduced 45 in sca method porous structure promoted the contract area between the coagulant and the wastewater reduced the compliance within the process and provided structures for the formation of the flocs 36 thus achieved a better effect than flocculent and the adsorbent acted separately as for the caf method this synergistic effect performed a weaker coordination compared the sfa method the interval between the adsorption and coagulation procedure reduced this auxiliary effect which decisively displayed an unsatisfying repercussion 37 46 47 the cca method displayed another type of synergy effect through forming floc grids coagulants triggered the sweeping effect within the reaction which accelerated the formation of flocs with larger size 37 also the addition of the coagulation changed the density of the wastewater and strength the netting mechanism 24 combined with the advantages all above promoted the adsorption and sediment effect of the ac adsorption procedure which eventually provided much better treating effect than the individual procedure of the coagulation and adsorption it can therefore be inferred that combined coagulation adsorption method which literally means using ac adsorption after the coagulation is the optimal method in the cod removal of wastewater hence we have chosen this method in the following trails 3 3 2 discussion about optimal ratio of coagulant to adsorbent fig 4 displayed the cod values and the cod removal ratio of various trails while fixing the addition amount of ac as 30 g l the ratios of coagulant to absorbent by adding pafs with various quantities were changed taking the quantity of pafs as x axis coordinate a significant peak on the cod removal ratio curve can be observed while the pafs dosage is below 6 g l the cod of the liquid samples reduced as the dosage raises then reach the peak at around 6 g l and achieve the maximum cod removal ratio of 44 04 afterwards when the addition amount is in the range of 6 12 g l the cod removal ratio decreased as the dosage of pafs increased in the view of the ratio of coagulant to adsorbent when the pafs dosage was 6 g l and the ac dosage was 30 g l the coagulation combined ac adsorption had the highest cod removal ratio which means the optimal ratio of pafs to ac is 0 2 the data strongly demonstrated the previous thesis on the synergistic effect in the coagulation combined ac adsorption by enhancing the netting mechanism and sweeping effect by forming flocs the adsorption efficiency was promoted as for the negative correlation of the cod removal ratio and the pafs addition amount in the range of 6 12 g l the fact perfectly accords with the coagulation window thesis as the excess coagulant had been added into the wastewater the excess inorganic salt ion from the coagulant could become part of solute in the wastewater 23 which can trigger the colloidal re stabilization then the original colloid with negative charge in water is changed into colloid with positive charge re stabilize the colloid and avoid the sediment of the colloids and eventually led to this repercussion the transmittance of the liquid sample after the treatment was promoted to 79 after treated by the coagulation combined adsorption in optimal dosage 6 g l 30 g l took prudence attitude towards the statistics from the previous experiments and considered the current findings comprehensively evaluating economy treating efficiency and sustainability we chose 0 2 as the optimal ratio of the coagulant and absorbent for the following trails which means the dosage for the pafs and ac was 6 g l and 30 g l 3 3 3 research on optimal dosage of coagulant aid pam was used as the coagulant aid and adjusted the ratio between pam and pafs by changing the addition amount of pam fig 5 provided vivid results of the trail groups in the experiment on deciding the optimal dosage of the coagulant aid based on the previous experiments the dosage of the pafs and ac were fixed as 6 g l and 30 g l which had the optimal ratio of coagulant to adsorbent and changing the addition amount of pam the cod value of the liquid samples from each trail groups were measured then drew the cod removal curve with the preset evaluation formula within the figure a significant peak on the cod removal ratio can be observed as the pam addition amount was 10 mg l the removal ratio reached 68 41 which is far better than any other previous treating sequence the results perfectly demonstrated with the previous thesis while using pam as coagulant aid for pafs in coagulation the long chain organic macromolecules within pam promoted the sweeping and bridging effect with the uneven distributions of the hetero charges certain electrostatic attraction was created between particular organic particles within the wastewater causing the zeta potential unequal to zero in such way as to form more flocs between the colloids and accelerated the coagulation process 36 with various addition amount of the coagulant aid the zeta potential could various between a certain range within the range the coagulant aid has a strong promoting effect on the coagulation process when excess coagulant was added in the wastewater it would affect the electric neutralization and the colloidal destabilization occurs thus the bridging and sweeping effect continuously weakened 40 48 51 as for the adsorption procedure coagulant aid enhanced the netting mechanism and sweeping effect by forming flocs 46 hence the adsorption efficiency was promoted appendix a b presented vivified results of the wastewater treated with different addition amount of the coagulant aid it can be clearly observed the excellent effect after the coagulation combined adsorption in the view of whole picture the addition of pam significantly enhanced the precipitation the liquid samples had clearer appearance compared to other procedures the transmittance of the liquid sample after the treatment was promoted to 89 from 23 considering various implications indicated in the current findings comprehensively evaluating economy treating efficiency and sustainability at the end of day it can be assumed that 10 mg l is the ideal dosage for the pam in the coagulation combined ac adsorption the optimal dosage for pafs pam and ac was 6 g l 10 mg l 30 g l which can achieve a removal ratio of 68 41 in the wastewater original cod value is 41 825 from food waste htc 3 4 analysis of the deposition from the optimal group 3 4 1 xrd analysis fig 6 displayed the xrd patterns of the depositions from every optimal group fig 6 a represented the xrd patterns for the deposition collected from the ac adsorption it can be uncovered the spectrum that the main components adsorbed by the ac were trioxane amino and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma fig 6 b represented the xrd patterns for the deposition collected from the pafs coagulation which was mainly consists of anthrone ferulic acid and compounds calcium through forming flocs fig 6 c presented the xrd patterns for the pafs combined ac adsorption process xarthene carbamide ferulic acid and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma were detected from the sediment fig 6 d presented the xrd patterns for coagulant aided coagulation combined adsorption process xarthene troxane ferulic acid and inorganic compounds composed of calcium magnesium and aluminum plasma were detected from the sediment these findings clearly demonstrated the previous results 7 32 52 the ac adsorption and coagulation procedure removed various organic pollutants in the wastewater by different mechanisms 53 when treating the wastewater with coagulation combined adsorption procedure which trigger synergy effect through forming floc grids coagulants triggered the sweeping effect within the reaction then accelerated the formation of flocs hence more organic and inorganic pollutants has been detected from the sediment as it was shown in fig 6 d with the bridging effect of the coagulant aid more organic and inorganic pollutants were fixed within the deposition demonstrated the coagulant aided coagulation combined ac adsorption has the highest cod removal ratio 3 4 2 sem patterns fig 7 provided sem images of the sediments collected from each optimal trail from low magnification images it could be easily observed that the ac was the main content displayed in the figure in high magnification images the micropores on the surfaces of the ac could be clearly observed which demonstrated that the high adsorption ability was caused by its high specific surface and extensively micropore structure 11 24 compared to fig 7 a the micropores of the ac from fig 7 b c adsorbed much more surface groups the findings further demonstrated the synergy effect in coagulation combined ac adsorption through forming floc grids coagulants triggered the sweeping effect within the reaction which accelerated the formation of flocs with larger size 3 5 analysis of the liquid sample from optimal group 3 5 1 functional group analysis by ftir the ftir analysis uncovered the chemical bonds within the original htc wastewater and the liquid samples after all optimal treating methods in fig 8 a the miscellaneous peak between 4000 3500 cm 1 demonstrated the existence of water within the original htc wastewater the patterns between 2000 2200 cm 1 stood for the overtone spectrum for aromatic hydrocarbon the peak between 1400 1300 cm 1 demonstrated the existence of ch groups in fig 8 a d the peak between 3000 3400 cm 1 represented the stretching vibration of hydroxyl the curve between 2500 and 3000 cm 1 represented for the existence of methylene 54 and the peak between 1500 1650 cm 1 gave significant reflection on the existence of cc structure and aromatic rings 55 the following findings clearly demonstrated the previous results while the pretreatment cannot remove cod which means there remained some pollutants within water further discussion on gc ms analysis would gave more specific results on the organic pollutants removed within the process 3 5 2 organic compound analysis by gc ms the original wastewater and the liquid samples collected from various trails were measured by gc ms and the results are listed in fig 9 the comparisons of different treating methods with the original htc wastewater were shown in fig 9 a c and the ion current of all treating methods was displayed in fig 9 d the original htc wastewater contained a great number of organic pollutants and the typical pollutants within the htc wastewater were listed in table 5 roughly contained 19 typical organic pollutants including phenols hydrocarbons esters and amines 56 the result displayed in gc ms ion current figures was consistent with the results shown in ftir analysis the organic pollutants detected in the liquid phase contained complex organic macromolecules which had a long molecular chain as it is shown in fig 9 a the ac adsorption could have a significant removal effect on the phenols alkanes and esters and the number of the typical pollutants reduced to 10 kinds and the adsorption procedure also had a significant removal effect on long chain macromolecules like c26 c30 alkanes the findings demonstrated the fact that the adsorption capacity of ac was determined by the surface properties molecule characteristics competitions between different components and particle structure 24 while gc ms images uncovered the high content of the phenols and alkanes the phenols and some alkanes detected and listed in table 5 could be easily been adsorbed by the ac since their diameters were smaller than the pore size of the ac thus they could easily enter the inside body of the ac the Ï Ï hypothesis focus on the Ï Ï dispersion interaction 57 the certain reactions were taken place between the Ï electron between aromatic rings and activated partial graphite layers 23 45 57 as for long chain macromolecule alkanes the adsorption procedure seemed to have a weaker effect for the diameters of those alkanes were larger than the pore size of the ac and limited the adsorption effect but the adsorption procedure could have a better adsorption effect on the long chain alkanes with higher molecular weight for the intermolecular van der waals force raised as the molecular weight raised 58 59 in this way the ac adsorption could have a significant cod removal effect on htc wastewater the fig 9 b provided the total ion current image of coagulation combined ac adsorption procedure compared to fig 9 a the coagulation procedure could greatly improve the removal effect on the long chain macromolecules like c21 c30 alkanes also reduced the contents of phenols within the liquid samples hence the number of the typical pollutants were decreased to 9 kinds the long chain macromolecule alkanes which could trigger the sweep effect and been removed by forming floc in the coagulation procedure 60 were removed for about 43 within the process as in fig 9 c with the addition of coagulant aid the long chain organic macromolecules within pam promoted the sweeping and bridging effect with the uneven distributions of the hetero charges certain electrostatic attraction was created between particular organic particles within the wastewater causing the zeta potential unequal to zero in such way as to form more flocs between the colloids and accelerated the coagulation process 36 in this mechanism the long chain alkanes and phenols were removed by forming flocs thus the typical pollutants were reduced to 8 kinds the findings clearly demonstrated that the coagulation combined ac adsorption and pam aided coagulation combined ac adsorption could have a significant cod removal effect on htc wastewater while more than 70 of long chain alkanes and most of the phenols were removed the increase of the intensity between 5 7 5 min was caused by the deposition of pam in the solution and turned into acrylamide 54 which could promote the biodegradability of the wastewater for the acrylamide was easy to be composed by the microorganisms 3 5 3 bod analysis of the liquid sample from the optimal groups table 6 displayed the bod values and bod cod ratio of the liquid sample from the optimal groups the bod cod ratio generally reflects the biochemical index of the samples which provides vital references for the following biochemical treatment of the samples studies had proved that when the bod cod ratio is between 0 3 0 5 so the current water will be suitable for anaerobic fermentation treatment 45 as the bod cod ratio is over 0 5 the liquid samples would be typically suitable for biochemical treatment as it is showed in table 6 the ac adsorption process approximately raised the bod cod ratio for 0 077 compared to the original wastewater which greatly promoted the potential for further biochemical treatment comprehensively considering the conclusions in gc ms and ftir analysis the adsorption procedure reduced the phenols aromatic hydrocarbon and certain long chain alkanes which could be harmful for the aerobic fermentation and eventually promote the biodegradability of the wastewater those refractory organics had a bod cod ratio at around 0 03 0 17 61 63 the coagulation and adsorption procedure had been demonstrated to significantly remove those refractory organics which explained that the decrease of bod was less than the decrease of cod the pafs coagulation combined ac adsorption further raised the bod cod ratio for 0 155 achieved 0 451 by removing inorganic compounds and organic matter within the liquid samples through forming flocs and adsorption hence the wastewater was clearly suitable for biochemical treatment after this procedure with the addition of pam the bod cod ratio raised to 0 750 it could be inferred from the gc ms and ftir results that the addition of this organic coagulant greatly removed a large number of long chain alkanes phenols aromatic hydrocarbon which could hardly be oxidative decomposed in anaerobic fermentation 9 the negative effect of the long chain alkanes to the anaerobic fermentation could attribute the toxicity of these alkanes to cell membranes so as to inhibit the growth of bacteria 64 67 and gc ms images also proved that the remaining pam in the solution have decomposed into acrylamide which had a bod cod ratio over 0 97 68 69 hence increase the bod value and greatly promoted the biodegradability of the wastewater also explained that the cod value decreased greatly after the pam treatment while bod value had a mild change comparing all three treating methods the bod values of each trail had a mild change comparing to the changes in cod values this clearly demonstrated the conclusions in ftir and gc ms analysis that most refractory organic pollutants aromatic hydrocarbon alkanes and phenols were removed within the treating process while the contents of biodegradable substrate had smaller changes within the process 4 conclusions the results and observations listed in this research indicated the importance of selecting the suitable coagulants and adsorbent determining optimal dosage ratio and treating sequence in the treatment of wastewater from food waste htc the general conclusions are extracted as following 1 the

13176,knowledge of co transport behavior of heavy metals in polyaluminium chloride and anionic polyacrylamide water treatment residuals pac apam wtrs is critical if pac apam wtrs are to be used as a layered media of stormwater bioretention systems to effectively remove contamination of some heavy metals column studies of pac apam wtrs were conducted to investigate the transport behavior of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 in mono component binary ternary and quaternary systems and the impact of the presence of one or more heavy metals on the retention and mobility of the other heavy metal the analysis of breakthrough curves and the retardation factors rf demonstrated that the selectivity order of heavy metal ions in the quaternary system was primarily governed by electronegativity with a higher electronegativity being more favorable to adsorption the mobility of the tested heavy metals through pac apam wtrs was in the order of zn2 91 rf decrease cd2 55 rf decrease cu2 75 rf decrease pb2 66 rf decrease with predominant retention of pb2 and cu2 the competitive adsorption was found to lower the retardation factor and the average maximum adsorption capacity cu2 71 decrease pb2 67 decrease cd2 54 decrease and zn2 81 decrease and facilitated the transport in the tested systems the adsorption of a metal became more reversible due to competitive adsorption it is inferred that the presence of some heavy metals in the stormwater runoff would increase the mobility of other metals in the pac apam wtrs layer of a bioretention system keywords breakthrough curve competitive adsorption heavy metals transport mobility multi component system 1 introduction contamination of groundwater and surface water bodies by heavy metals is a global concern by environmental professionals due to their toxicity to animals and humans 1 2 unfortunately contamination of heavy metals caused by stormwater runoff has become another global issue since those heavy metals can be readily transported to groundwater and surface water and ultimately transferred into the food chain and the human diet 3 4 anthropogenic activities are the main source of heavy metal contamination of stormwater runoff stormwater runoff often carries substantial quantities of heavy metals once it flows through heavy metal contaminated industrial waste sites and over highways parking lots lawns treated with fertilizer atmospheric deposited sites from dust events and building roofs made with various metal materials 5 9 previous studies reported that stormwater runoff from roadways contained 22 7033 Î¼g l of cu 73 1780 Î¼g l of pb and 56 929 Î¼g l of zn 5 the frequent occurring heavy metals in stormwater runoff include but are not limited to cu pb cd and zn 5 7 10 11 stormwater bioretention systems are widely used as an engineered solution to deal with stormwater contamination throughout the world 11 the filling media within the bioretention system is the critical component that determines the removal effectiveness of the various pollutants encountered in the runoff 11 12 due to the poor performance of traditional media used especially with respect to treating an increasingly exacerbating list of contaminants within the stormwater runoff global environmental professionals are exploring alternative media sources to enhance pollutant removal water treatment residuals wtrs are wastes produced during municipal drinking water treatment processes wtrs have emerged as a favorable source of media used within stormwater bioretention systems and have gained global interests due to their considerable advantages in contaminant removal 11 it is noted that wtrs can efficiently remove phosphorus 11 13 20 and heavy metals 9 21 28 also have the ability to remove organic pollutants 29 32 following the concept of a circular economy the prominent advantage of reusing wtrs in stormwater bioretention systems lie in low cost in handling and disposal of those residuals with the benefit of cleaning contaminated stormwater in the past few years there is a notable trend that more and more municipal drinking water treatment plants have adopted the use of polyaluminium chloride pac as a coagulant in water purification and anionic polyacrylamide apam as the dewatering agent in the handling process of the sludge this is true around the world and especially in china consequently the amount of pac apam wtrs produced has rapidly increase 23 24 understanding the transport mechanisms of heavy metals with these pac apam wtrs as a media within stormwater bioretention systems is critical for accomplishing the ultimate engineering design of the application column studies are widely regarded as the basic premise for field studies thus can be employed to provide more information than batch studies 1 2 although previous studies 23 24 have demonstrated the adsorption mechanisms of heavy metal ions including cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 by pac apam wtrs in mono component systems to the best of authors knowledge the use of pac apam wtrs have not been considered in multi component systems the objectives of this study were to investigate the retention and transport behavior of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 through pac apam wtrs and to identify the impacts of the presence of one or more heavy metal on the retention transport and mobility of the other heavy metal within the pac apam wtrs as described above cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 were often found in stormwater runoff with relatively high concentrations thus they were selected as the targeted pollutants in this study column studies were utilized to investigate their simultaneous transport in mono component binary ternary and quaternary systems the results from this study are expected to provide additional information than equilibrium batch studies could provide 2 materials and methods 2 1 pac apam wtrs samples and reagents pac apam wtrs were collected at a municipal water treatment plant located in taiyuan city shanxi province china pac apam wtrs samples were air dried and ground and screened through a 2 mm sieve the particles 2 mm were thoroughly mixed prior to the analysis of the physical chemical properties and the column studies table 1 shows the physical chemical properties of pac apam wtrs the texture of pac apam wtrs were analyzed by the sieving method 33 bulk density was measured using the core method 33 specific surface area was determined by using the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and porosimeter asap2020c micromeritics instrument corporation norcross ga usa hydraulic conductivity was determined by using the falling head method 34 the ph of pac apam wtrs was measured at a ratio of 1 2 m v after a four hour mixing period 35 the effective cation exchange capacity cece was determined using the method provided by the soil science society of america 35 the elements including c n o h and s were analyzed using the element analyzer vario el cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh langenselbold germany the sem images of pac apam wtrs can be seen in our previous studies 23 24 30 the solutions of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 were freshly prepared by dissolving designated amounts of pbcl2 cucl2 cdcl2 and zncl2 in ultra pure water immediately prior to use the initial solution ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 mol l hcl or 0 1 mol l naoh all chemical reagents were at analytical grade and the number of replications was three during the analysis 2 2 setup of transport experiments glass columns with an effective pac apam wtrs media height of 10 cm and an inner diameter of 2 5 cm were uniformly filled with five 2 0 cm high media packed layers a layer was sufficiently compacted before another layer was filled in above it all columns packed with pac apam wtrs were assumed to be identical with the bulk density of 1 12 g cm3 prior to running the transport experiments all pac apam wtrs columns were saturated with ultra pure water pumped from the column bottoms for at least 17 h to remove entrapped air 1 36 to avoid possible preferential flows in the subsequent transport experiments 37 in the tracer transport experiments 0 4 mmol l bromide br solutions were continuously pumped from the column bottom with an influent flow rate of 8 0 5 ml h 1 the column effluents were collected by an automatic fraction collector and analyzed for br using ion chromatography after centrifugal separation and syringe filtration after the br concentration in the effluent equaled the initial concentration ultra pure water was injected replacing the bromide solution until the br concentration in effluent was approximately zero after the tracer transport experiments were completed the various solutions of heavy metals at a ph 6 were injected into the column bottoms the periodically collected effluent samples were centrifuged filtered and analyzed for the four tested metals cu2 pb2 cd2 or zn2 using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry analytik jena model zeenit 700 jena germany the concentration of each heavy metal ionic species used was 2 mmol l in all the tests table 2 breakthrough curves btcs were plotted using c c0 and pore volume pv c c0 was the relative concentration where c and c0 are the effluent and the influent concentrations of br or heavy metal ions respectively 2 3 the retardation factor rf the retardation factor rf can be used to characterize the retention of a solute in the columns by quantifying the interactions between the solute and the media 38 39 also it was used to study the competitive adsorption of heavy metals in soil column studies 1 the rf of each heavy metal ion was determined using eq 1 1 r f pv half max c o nc heavy metal ion pv inj heavy metal ion pv half max conc bromide pv inj bromide where pvhalf max conc heavy metal ion is the pore volume of a heavy metal ion with its concentration in elution reaching half maximum concentration while pvhalf max conc bromide is the pore volume of bromide in effluent at half maximum concentration since all maximum concentrations in the effluent reached c0 throughout all experiments pvhalf max conc heavy metal ion and pvhalf max conc bromide were the pore volume at c c0 0 5 pvinj heavy metal ion or pvinj bromide is the pore volume of the start of heavy metal ion injection or bromide injection both equaled to zero in this study eq 1 is rewritten by replacing the time with pore volume from the rf determination method provided by widmer et al 39 and ringering et al 38 this determined method quantifies the retardation of heavy metal ions in the pac apam wtrs columns by comparing the btcs of heavy metal ions to that of the bromide 3 results and discussion 3 1 tracer breakthrough curves transport experiments for the non reactive tracer br were conducted to obtain the hydrodynamic characteristics of pac apam wtrs columns a set of the tracer btcs are presented in fig 1 approximately symmetrical btcs of bromide illustrated that equilibrium transport occurred in the pac apam wtrs columns under the employed hydraulic conditions 1 37 it implies that the transport behaviors of heavy metal ions were ideal in the following transport experiments under the same conditions 1 37 the initial breakthrough of the br tracer happened at pv 0 5 the ratio of c c0 rapidly increased to 1 0 after which it started to decrease at pv 3 5 and finally dropped to zero at pv 5 5 3 2 transport of cu2 for clarity a set of btcs of cu2 in mono component binary ternary and quaternary systems are presented in fig 2 showing the relationship between the relative concentration and pore volume the replicated experiments showed very similar results confirming the repeatability all initial breakthroughs of cu2 occurring after pv 5 and the subsequent concentration increase in different systems was slower than that of the tracer in the injection phase especially in the mono component system which is due to the adsorption reactions all transports of cu2 reached equilibrium at c c0 1 0 at different pv which signifies the end of the injection of cu2 solutions the ph variance was less than 0 05 in the effluent and the influent throughout the experiments table 2 presents the parameters of pac apam wtrs columns used in co transport studies of heavy metal ions over thirty day experimental 260 pvs period complete btcs of cu2 including the injection and the flushing phase were not always attained fig 2 in different systems for example the required time of a complete btc for cu2 was estimated to be at least 57 days or 500 pvs in the mono component system when estimating movement with the hydrus 1d modeling it was observed fig 2 that the presence of the other heavy metals in combination shortened the time or the number of pv for cu2 required to achieve a complete btc with each do a different extent that was most likely due to a different level of competitive adsorption the distinct example was that the time or pv of a complete btc was 18 5 days 160 pvs for cu2 in quaternary system during the flushing desorption phase in the quaternary system the concentration of cu2 dropped quickly the long tail for the mono component system and in the binary system of cu2 zn2 in the flushing phase indicated the slower release of cu2 compared to that in the other systems 38 it is noted that the transport experiments ended before the concentration in the elution reached zero in all systems except in quaternary system as mentioned above comparison of the cu2 btcs in the different systems fig 2 shows that the presence of other heavy metal ions resulted in different transport and retention behaviors of cu2 in the columns the tailing patterns of btcs of cu2 in single binary and ternary systems in the flushing phase show that the desorption was a slow process fig 2 the initial breakthrough time of cu2 was 10 pvs in the mono component system while it was pushed forward to 5 pvs in the quaternary system which is most likely due to competitive adsorption all the other initial breakthrough times were in the range of 5 to 10 pvs cu2 in the mono component system showed a much higher retardation with rf 32 47 compared to that in the other systems while cu2 in the quaternary system presented the lowest retardation rf 8 22 75 decrease table 2 this change in retardation can be attributed to the competition for active sites possibly resulting in the obvious changes of the retardation factor rf of a heavy metal ion during co transport 1 compared with the mono component system rf of cu2 decreased to 12 99 60 decrease 14 07 57 decrease and 23 81 27 decrease in the binary systems of cu2 pb2 cu2 cd2 and cu2 zn2 respectively this decrease probably indicates that the order of competition by the other three heavy metal ionic species with cu2 was pb2 cd2 zn2 from strongest to weakest respectively rf of cu2 decreased to 8 53 74 decrease 9 22 72 decrease and 12 31 62 decrease in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 cu2 pb2 zn2 and cu2 cd2 zn2 respectively the results show that the rf of cu2 was a function of competitive heavy metal ionic species simultaneously existing in pac apam wtrs columns and the number of these species as used in this study one study of competitive adsorption of heavy metals onto carbon nanoparticles in quartz sand columns demonstrated that the use of carbon nanoparticles facilitated the transport of cu2 and pb2 and pb2 had higher adsorption in the cu2 pb2 system resulting higher retention in the columns than cu2 40 another study on co transport of heavy metals using columns reported by won et al 2 indicated that the adsorption preference was pb2 cu2 zn2 onto the silica sand in the cu2 pb2 zn2 system 2 both reported studies had similar findings to this study 3 3 transport of pb2 all btcs of pb2 in different systems fig 3 were longer than those of the non reactive tracer fig 1 relative later breakthrough and slower rise of pb2 with highest rf 64 94 were observed in the mono component system than in the other systems during the injection phase the shorter btc of pb2 also was observed in the quaternary system with rf of 22 08 66 decrease competition for active reaction sites from the other metal species in binary systems resulted in the decrease of rf to 9 74 85 decrease 17 32 73 decrease and 20 02 69 decrease table 2 in the systems of cu2 pb2 pb2 cd2 and pb2 zn2 respectively similar observation was reported by zhao et al 41 in the pb2 cd2 systems in the column studies on the transport of heavy metal ions in moderately contaminated farmland soils 41 the competitive adsorption reduced rf of pb2 to 15 98 75 decrease 16 00 75 decrease and 30 70 53 decrease in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 cu2 pb2 zn2 and pb2 cd2 zn2 in this study respectively results showed that the sequence of the competitive ions that decreased the rf of pb2 was cu2 cd2 zn2 in the binary systems this decreased rf implies that cu2 had a stronger competition with pb2 present for available active sites while zn2 was weaker in competition also due to the relative weaker competition from cd2 and zn2 the rf decrease was similar in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 and cu2 pb2 zn2 and the difference of the rf decrease was not statistically significant p value 0 05 the weaker competition from cd2 and zn2 ions caused less decrease in the rf of pb2 in pb2 cd2 zn2 system than in the other two ternary systems containing cu2 this indirectly implies that cu2 had a stronger competitive ability when combined with pb2 than cd2 and zn2 in pac apam wtrs columns 3 4 transport of cd2 btcs of cd2 displayed different retention and transport behaviors than both cu2 and pb2 in different systems in pac apam wtrs columns fig 4 overall the initial breakthrough was much quicker 1 3 5 pvs than the pb2 and cu2 with a more rapid increase of concentration to the plateau which indicates that the cd2 adsorption onto active sites was much less than cu2 and pb2 during the injection phases although not all complete btcs for cd2 were obtained it is likely that the complete btcs of cd2 would be shorter than those of cu2 and pb2 the drop of the outlet concentration of cd2 was more rapid compared with that of cu2 and pb2 during the flushing phase the rf of cd2 in the other systems was lower than that rf 8 66 in the mono component system which is most likely caused by the increased competitive adsorption from the other metal ions this was further supported because the rf of cd2 in the quaternary system was lowest rf 3 88 55 decrease compared with that in the binary and ternary systems the rf of cd2 in the binary systems was lowered to 6 49 25 decrease 7 58 12 decrease and 8 12 6 decrease in the systems of cu2 cd2 pb2 cd2 and cd2 zn2 respectively this decrease shows that the sequence of competition with cd2 was cu2 pb2 zn2 in the binary systems in the ternary systems the rf of cd2 decreased to 3 90 55 decrease 7 34 15 decrease and 6 85 21 decrease in the systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 cu2 cd2 zn2 and pb2 cd2 zn2 respectively the rf decrease of cd2 in the system of cu2 pb2 cd2 had no significant difference p value 0 05 from that in the quaternary system indicating that zn2 had a relatively weaker competition with cd2 also this reaction for cd can be confirmed by the data in the binary systems 3 5 transport of zn2 btcs for zn2 showed a more rapid increase than the other metals tested resulting in an earlier initial breakthrough to the plateau concentration during the injection phase and a faster drop in relative concentration in the flushing phase for all multi component systems compared to the mono component system fig 5 this quick increase and decrease imply that there was more retention of zn2 in the injection phase of the mono component system compared to the other systems the complete btcs of zn2 were observed during the 30 day experiment period in all systems except in the mono component system the competitive adsorption caused the decrease in the rf of zn2 the primary justification is that the rf of zn2 significantly decreased from 17 32 in the mono component system to 1 50 91 decrease in quaternary system these data show that the mobility of zn2 was higher in the quaternary system the rf of zn2 decreased to 2 06 88 decrease 1 73 90 decrease and 2 71 84 decrease in the binary systems of cu2 zn2 pb2 zn2 and cd2 zn2 respectively this shows that the sequence of competition for active adsorption sites with zn2 was pb2 cu2 cd2 the rf of zn2 was 1 68 90 decrease 1 99 89 decrease and 1 84 89 decrease in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 zn2 cu2 cd2 zn2 and pb2 cd2 zn2 respectively the difference in the rf of zn2 was not statistically significant p value 0 05 in the ternary systems this indicates that the other two metal ionic species had similar effects of competitive adsorption for zn2 retention during the injection phase 3 6 competitive adsorption during transport the adsorbed cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 in the columns for the mono component systems were 0 038 mmol g 0 061 mmol g 0 013 mmol g and 0 026 mmol g respectively table 3 it can be inferred that the sequence of adsorption by the pac apam wtrs from greatest to least under the conditions of steady state saturated flow was pb2 cu2 zn2 cd2 previous studies of ft ir spectroscopy showed that carboxyl groups from the apam in wtrs as well as fe al o functional groups and oh groups simultaneously participated in the adsorption reactions 23 the affinity sequence of the four metal ions adsorbed onto pac apam wtrs followed the sequence of the first hydrolysis constants of pb 7 8 cu 8 0 zn 9 0 cd 10 1 42 43 it is recognized that the degree of these heavy metals being hydrolyzed was the major factor determining the retention of metal ions 42 which also determined the mobility in the mono component systems in the columns the presence of other heavy metal ions caused a decrease of the adsorbed amount of a metal in the quaternary system most of the binary systems and the ternary systems due to possible competitive adsorption during the co transport the adsorbed quantity of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 in the columns of the quaternary system were 0 011 mmol g 71 decrease 0 023 mmol g 62 decrease 0 006 mmol g 55 decrease and 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease respectively these data show that the sequence of affinity onto pac apam wtrs in the quaternary system was pb2 cu2 cd2 zn2 which was different from that found in the mono component systems this implies that the predominant adsorption of pb2 hinders the adsorption cu2 cd2 and zn2 onto the surface of pac apam wtrs and promote the transport of those three ions these results are similar to the findings 2 in which they found that the presence of pb2 reduced the adsorption of cu2 and zn2 through competition for active sites on the silica sand and kaolinite colloids the presence of pb2 also impedes the adsorption of zn2 ni2 and mn2 during the transport in lateritic soil columns 1 and the adsorption of cd2 in an agricultural soil 44 it is found in this study that the selectivity order adsorbed by pac apam wtrs was positively correlated with the pauling s electronegativity of the metals with higher electronegativity being more favorable the electronegativity order of these four metal ions is pb2 2 33 cu2 1 95 cd2 1 69 zn2 1 63 45 in the binary systems the adsorbed cu2 by the columns decreased to 0 017 mmol g 55 decrease 0 018 mmol g 53 decrease and 0 031 mmol g 18 decrease in the cu2 pb2 system the cu2 cd2 system and the cu2 zn2 system respectively no significant difference of the adsorbed cu2 was found between the cu2 pb2 system and the cu2 cd2 system p value 0 05 but the destructive effect of zn2 on cu2 was obviously less than pb2 and cd2 the co existence of pb2 with the other heavy metal ions decreased the adsorbed pb2 in the columns with significant difference to 0 016 mmol g 74 decrease 0 024 mmol g 61 decrease and 0 029 mmol g 52 decrease within the cu2 pb2 the pb2 cd2 and the pb2 zn2 systems respectively the adsorbed cd2 decreased to 0 010 mmol g 24 decrease and 0 012 mmol g 8 decrease within the cu2 cd2 and the pb2 cd2 systems respectively due to the destructive effects of cu2 and pb2 however zn2 demonstrated no significant impact on the adsorption of cd2 in the cd2 zn2 system 1 decrease the competitive adsorption possibly caused the decrease of the zn2 retention in the column to 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease and 0 007 mmol g 73 decrease in the cu2 zn2 the pb2 zn2 and the cd2 zn2 systems respectively the destructive effect of cu2 and pb2 on the adsorption of zn2 was approximately identical but significantly higher than that found for cd2 in the ternary systems the adsorbed cu2 was reduced to 0 011 mmol g 71 decrease 0 012 mmol g 68 decrease and 0 016 mmol g 58 decrease in the cu2 pb2 cd2 the cu2 pb2 zn2 and the cu2 cd2 zn2 systems respectively it is noted that the adsorbed cu2 in the cu2 pb2 cd2 system was not significantly different p value 0 05 from that in the quaternary system this difference implies that the competition effect of zn2 on cu2 was minimal or even negligible in the quaternary system the adsorbed pb2 was reduced to 0 020 mmol g 67 decrease 0 020 mmol g 67 decrease and 0 030 mmol g 51 decrease in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 cu2 pb2 zn2 and pb2 cd2 zn2 respectively both combinations of cu2 and cd2 and cu2 and zn2 had identical reduction effects on the pb2 adsorption in the ternary system while the cd2 and zn2 combination had less reduction effect the adsorbed cd2 decreased to 0 006 mmol g 55 decrease 0 011 mmol g 18 decrease and 0 011 mmol g 18 decrease in the cu2 pb2 cd2 the cu2 cd2 zn2 and the pb2 cd2 zn2 systems respectively note that the decrease in the cu2 pb2 cd2 system was not significantly different p value 0 05 than that found in the quaternary system the reduction effect of cu2 and pb2 together on cd2 was obviously higher than the other two combinations the retention of zn2 in the column of pac apam wtrs had no significant difference p value 0 05 in the cu2 pb2 zn2 system 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease and the pb2 cd2 zn2 system 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease which was also not significantly different p value 0 05 from that in the quaternary system the retention of zn2 was slightly higher in the cu2 cd2 zn2 system 0 006 mmol g 77 decrease the cu2 adsorption is more related to the inner sphere complexation while the adsorption of cd2 and zn2 are caused by the outer sphere complexation 46 cd2 often shares the same active sites with zn2 with a relatively strong competition 46 the mobility sequence of zn2 cd2 cu2 in the cu2 cd2 zn2 system found in this study is consistent with that reported by lin and xu 11 in the columns of layered saturated soil the results of a study on the effects of pine bark as a biosorbent on the transport of cu pb zn ni and cd in the heavy metal contaminated soils demonstrated that pb had the highest retention capacity while zn had the lowest retention capacity in the soil columns 47 that was consistent with the finding from this study most of btcs of heavy metals figs 2 5 had a fast increasing front of relative concentration up to the plateau in the retention phase and a rapid drop with a long tail in the flushing phase this shows the non linearity in adsorption during transport especially in the mono component systems 1 and that the faster adsorption time than residence time and the slower release from the adsorption sites to the solution were kinetically controlled 46 more coincidence between the arrival part and the inverted elution part in the binary ternary and quaternary systems than in the mono component systems figs 2 5 demonstrates the significant impacts of non linearity adsorption on the detention and mobility of a heavy metal in pac apam wtrs columns with the presence of other metals 1 the results of mass recovery table 3 show that the adsorption of a heavy metal except cd2 became more reversible and may be weaker when there was a presence of other heavy metals especially when compared to the adsorption from the mono component systems because mass recovery for a heavy metal in the mono component system was lower than that in the other systems 1 3 7 implication of engineering application given that pac apam wtrs are reused as a specific layered media in a stormwater bioretention system with an aim to simultaneously removing various heavy metal ions in stormwater runoff stormwater managers should be aware that the presence of some heavy metal ionic species in the stormwater runoff would increase the mobility of other heavy metal ionic species in the pac apam wtrs layer of a stormwater bioretention system once the concentrations of those heavy metal ions in stormwater runoff are sufficiently high zn2 may be more readily transported through the pac apam wtrs layer under the conditions of long time saturated steady state flow thus stormwater managers should assess the difference between the concentration of leached zn2 and other heavy metal ions from the stormwater bioretention systems and the allowed concentrations in the receiving waters and further determine whether additional engineering strategies are to be conducted during stormwater events in contrast pb2 may be more easily retained in the pac apam wtrs layer compared with other heavy metal ions the longevity of the pac apam wtrs layer should be assessed and predicted based on the performance of pb2 removal and transport in the management of a stormwater bioretention system with pac apam wtrs as a media layer 4 conclusions transport of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 was investigated in mono component binary ternary and quaternary systems in columns containing pac apam wtrs based on the analysis of the retention phase of the breakthrough curve the retention sequence in the mono component systems was pb2 cu2 zn2 cd2 which was consistent with the sequence of the first hydrolysis constant of these four heavy metals however the selectivity order of metal ion adsorption in the quaternary system was governed by the electronegativity with a higher electronegativity being more favorable to adsorption accordingly the mobility of heavy metals through pac apam wtrs was in the order of zn2 cd2 cu2 pb2 the decrease in the adsorbed amount of a metal ion in all binary ternary and quaternary systems indicated the competitive adsorption occurred which reduced both the retardation factor and the average maximum adsorption capacity thus facilitated transport it is inferred that the presence of some heavy metals in the stormwater runoff would increase the mobility of other metals in the pac apam wtrs layer of a bioretention system credit authorship contribution

widely used as an engineered solution to deal with stormwater contamination throughout the world 11 the filling media within the bioretention system is the critical component that determines the removal effectiveness of the various pollutants encountered in the runoff 11 12 due to the poor performance of traditional media used especially with respect to treating an increasingly exacerbating list of contaminants within the stormwater runoff global environmental professionals are exploring alternative media sources to enhance pollutant removal water treatment residuals wtrs are wastes produced during municipal drinking water treatment processes wtrs have emerged as a favorable source of media used within stormwater bioretention systems and have gained global interests due to their considerable advantages in contaminant removal 11 it is noted that wtrs can efficiently remove phosphorus 11 13 20 and heavy metals 9 21 28 also have the ability to remove organic pollutants 29 32 following the concept of a circular economy the prominent advantage of reusing wtrs in stormwater bioretention systems lie in low cost in handling and disposal of those residuals with the benefit of cleaning contaminated stormwater in the past few years there is a notable trend that more and more municipal drinking water treatment plants have adopted the use of polyaluminium chloride pac as a coagulant in water purification and anionic polyacrylamide apam as the dewatering agent in the handling process of the sludge this is true around the world and especially in china consequently the amount of pac apam wtrs produced has rapidly increase 23 24 understanding the transport mechanisms of heavy metals with these pac apam wtrs as a media within stormwater bioretention systems is critical for accomplishing the ultimate engineering design of the application column studies are widely regarded as the basic premise for field studies thus can be employed to provide more information than batch studies 1 2 although previous studies 23 24 have demonstrated the adsorption mechanisms of heavy metal ions including cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 by pac apam wtrs in mono component systems to the best of authors knowledge the use of pac apam wtrs have not been considered in multi component systems the objectives of this study were to investigate the retention and transport behavior of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 through pac apam wtrs and to identify the impacts of the presence of one or more heavy metal on the retention transport and mobility of the other heavy metal within the pac apam wtrs as described above cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 were often found in stormwater runoff with relatively high concentrations thus they were selected as the targeted pollutants in this study column studies were utilized to investigate their simultaneous transport in mono component binary ternary and quaternary systems the results from this study are expected to provide additional information than equilibrium batch studies could provide 2 materials and methods 2 1 pac apam wtrs samples and reagents pac apam wtrs were collected at a municipal water treatment plant located in taiyuan city shanxi province china pac apam wtrs samples were air dried and ground and screened through a 2 mm sieve the particles 2 mm were thoroughly mixed prior to the analysis of the physical chemical properties and the column studies table 1 shows the physical chemical properties of pac apam wtrs the texture of pac apam wtrs were analyzed by the sieving method 33 bulk density was measured using the core method 33 specific surface area was determined by using the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and porosimeter asap2020c micromeritics instrument corporation norcross ga usa hydraulic conductivity was determined by using the falling head method 34 the ph of pac apam wtrs was measured at a ratio of 1 2 m v after a four hour mixing period 35 the effective cation exchange capacity cece was determined using the method provided by the soil science society of america 35 the elements including c n o h and s were analyzed using the element analyzer vario el cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh langenselbold germany the sem images of pac apam wtrs can be seen in our previous studies 23 24 30 the solutions of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 were freshly prepared by dissolving designated amounts of pbcl2 cucl2 cdcl2 and zncl2 in ultra pure water immediately prior to use the initial solution ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 mol l hcl or 0 1 mol l naoh all chemical reagents were at analytical grade and the number of replications was three during the analysis 2 2 setup of transport experiments glass columns with an effective pac apam wtrs media height of 10 cm and an inner diameter of 2 5 cm were uniformly filled with five 2 0 cm high media packed layers a layer was sufficiently compacted before another layer was filled in above it all columns packed with pac apam wtrs were assumed to be identical with the bulk density of 1 12 g cm3 prior to running the transport experiments all pac apam wtrs columns were saturated with ultra pure water pumped from the column bottoms for at least 17 h to remove entrapped air 1 36 to avoid possible preferential flows in the subsequent transport experiments 37 in the tracer transport experiments 0 4 mmol l bromide br solutions were continuously pumped from the column bottom with an influent flow rate of 8 0 5 ml h 1 the column effluents were collected by an automatic fraction collector and analyzed for br using ion chromatography after centrifugal separation and syringe filtration after the br concentration in the effluent equaled the initial concentration ultra pure water was injected replacing the bromide solution until the br concentration in effluent was approximately zero after the tracer transport experiments were completed the various solutions of heavy metals at a ph 6 were injected into the column bottoms the periodically collected effluent samples were centrifuged filtered and analyzed for the four tested metals cu2 pb2 cd2 or zn2 using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry analytik jena model zeenit 700 jena germany the concentration of each heavy metal ionic species used was 2 mmol l in all the tests table 2 breakthrough curves btcs were plotted using c c0 and pore volume pv c c0 was the relative concentration where c and c0 are the effluent and the influent concentrations of br or heavy metal ions respectively 2 3 the retardation factor rf the retardation factor rf can be used to characterize the retention of a solute in the columns by quantifying the interactions between the solute and the media 38 39 also it was used to study the competitive adsorption of heavy metals in soil column studies 1 the rf of each heavy metal ion was determined using eq 1 1 r f pv half max c o nc heavy metal ion pv inj heavy metal ion pv half max conc bromide pv inj bromide where pvhalf max conc heavy metal ion is the pore volume of a heavy metal ion with its concentration in elution reaching half maximum concentration while pvhalf max conc bromide is the pore volume of bromide in effluent at half maximum concentration since all maximum concentrations in the effluent reached c0 throughout all experiments pvhalf max conc heavy metal ion and pvhalf max conc bromide were the pore volume at c c0 0 5 pvinj heavy metal ion or pvinj bromide is the pore volume of the start of heavy metal ion injection or bromide injection both equaled to zero in this study eq 1 is rewritten by replacing the time with pore volume from the rf determination method provided by widmer et al 39 and ringering et al 38 this determined method quantifies the retardation of heavy metal ions in the pac apam wtrs columns by comparing the btcs of heavy metal ions to that of the bromide 3 results and discussion 3 1 tracer breakthrough curves transport experiments for the non reactive tracer br were conducted to obtain the hydrodynamic characteristics of pac apam wtrs columns a set of the tracer btcs are presented in fig 1 approximately symmetrical btcs of bromide illustrated that equilibrium transport occurred in the pac apam wtrs columns under the employed hydraulic conditions 1 37 it implies that the transport behaviors of heavy metal ions were ideal in the following transport experiments under the same conditions 1 37 the initial breakthrough of the br tracer happened at pv 0 5 the ratio of c c0 rapidly increased to 1 0 after which it started to decrease at pv 3 5 and finally dropped to zero at pv 5 5 3 2 transport of cu2 for clarity a set of btcs of cu2 in mono component binary ternary and quaternary systems are presented in fig 2 showing the relationship between the relative concentration and pore volume the replicated experiments showed very similar results confirming the repeatability all initial breakthroughs of cu2 occurring after pv 5 and the subsequent concentration increase in different systems was slower than that of the tracer in the injection phase especially in the mono component system which is due to the adsorption reactions all transports of cu2 reached equilibrium at c c0 1 0 at different pv which signifies the end of the injection of cu2 solutions the ph variance was less than 0 05 in the effluent and the influent throughout the experiments table 2 presents the parameters of pac apam wtrs columns used in co transport studies of heavy metal ions over thirty day experimental 260 pvs period complete btcs of cu2 including the injection and the flushing phase were not always attained fig 2 in different systems for example the required time of a complete btc for cu2 was estimated to be at least 57 days or 500 pvs in the mono component system when estimating movement with the hydrus 1d modeling it was observed fig 2 that the presence of the other heavy metals in combination shortened the time or the number of pv for cu2 required to achieve a complete btc with each do a different extent that was most likely due to a different level of competitive adsorption the distinct example was that the time or pv of a complete btc was 18 5 days 160 pvs for cu2 in quaternary system during the flushing desorption phase in the quaternary system the concentration of cu2 dropped quickly the long tail for the mono component system and in the binary system of cu2 zn2 in the flushing phase indicated the slower release of cu2 compared to that in the other systems 38 it is noted that the transport experiments ended before the concentration in the elution reached zero in all systems except in quaternary system as mentioned above comparison of the cu2 btcs in the different systems fig 2 shows that the presence of other heavy metal ions resulted in different transport and retention behaviors of cu2 in the columns the tailing patterns of btcs of cu2 in single binary and ternary systems in the flushing phase show that the desorption was a slow process fig 2 the initial breakthrough time of cu2 was 10 pvs in the mono component system while it was pushed forward to 5 pvs in the quaternary system which is most likely due to competitive adsorption all the other initial breakthrough times were in the range of 5 to 10 pvs cu2 in the mono component system showed a much higher retardation with rf 32 47 compared to that in the other systems while cu2 in the quaternary system presented the lowest retardation rf 8 22 75 decrease table 2 this change in retardation can be attributed to the competition for active sites possibly resulting in the obvious changes of the retardation factor rf of a heavy metal ion during co transport 1 compared with the mono component system rf of cu2 decreased to 12 99 60 decrease 14 07 57 decrease and 23 81 27 decrease in the binary systems of cu2 pb2 cu2 cd2 and cu2 zn2 respectively this decrease probably indicates that the order of competition by the other three heavy metal ionic species with cu2 was pb2 cd2 zn2 from strongest to weakest respectively rf of cu2 decreased to 8 53 74 decrease 9 22 72 decrease and 12 31 62 decrease in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 cu2 pb2 zn2 and cu2 cd2 zn2 respectively the results show that the rf of cu2 was a function of competitive heavy metal ionic species simultaneously existing in pac apam wtrs columns and the number of these species as used in this study one study of competitive adsorption of heavy metals onto carbon nanoparticles in quartz sand columns demonstrated that the use of carbon nanoparticles facilitated the transport of cu2 and pb2 and pb2 had higher adsorption in the cu2 pb2 system resulting higher retention in the columns than cu2 40 another study on co transport of heavy metals using columns reported by won et al 2 indicated that the adsorption preference was pb2 cu2 zn2 onto the silica sand in the cu2 pb2 zn2 system 2 both reported studies had similar findings to this study 3 3 transport of pb2 all btcs of pb2 in different systems fig 3 were longer than those of the non reactive tracer fig 1 relative later breakthrough and slower rise of pb2 with highest rf 64 94 were observed in the mono component system than in the other systems during the injection phase the shorter btc of pb2 also was observed in the quaternary system with rf of 22 08 66 decrease competition for active reaction sites from the other metal species in binary systems resulted in the decrease of rf to 9 74 85 decrease 17 32 73 decrease and 20 02 69 decrease table 2 in the systems of cu2 pb2 pb2 cd2 and pb2 zn2 respectively similar observation was reported by zhao et al 41 in the pb2 cd2 systems in the column studies on the transport of heavy metal ions in moderately contaminated farmland soils 41 the competitive adsorption reduced rf of pb2 to 15 98 75 decrease 16 00 75 decrease and 30 70 53 decrease in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 cu2 pb2 zn2 and pb2 cd2 zn2 in this study respectively results showed that the sequence of the competitive ions that decreased the rf of pb2 was cu2 cd2 zn2 in the binary systems this decreased rf implies that cu2 had a stronger competition with pb2 present for available active sites while zn2 was weaker in competition also due to the relative weaker competition from cd2 and zn2 the rf decrease was similar in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 and cu2 pb2 zn2 and the difference of the rf decrease was not statistically significant p value 0 05 the weaker competition from cd2 and zn2 ions caused less decrease in the rf of pb2 in pb2 cd2 zn2 system than in the other two ternary systems containing cu2 this indirectly implies that cu2 had a stronger competitive ability when combined with pb2 than cd2 and zn2 in pac apam wtrs columns 3 4 transport of cd2 btcs of cd2 displayed different retention and transport behaviors than both cu2 and pb2 in different systems in pac apam wtrs columns fig 4 overall the initial breakthrough was much quicker 1 3 5 pvs than the pb2 and cu2 with a more rapid increase of concentration to the plateau which indicates that the cd2 adsorption onto active sites was much less than cu2 and pb2 during the injection phases although not all complete btcs for cd2 were obtained it is likely that the complete btcs of cd2 would be shorter than those of cu2 and pb2 the drop of the outlet concentration of cd2 was more rapid compared with that of cu2 and pb2 during the flushing phase the rf of cd2 in the other systems was lower than that rf 8 66 in the mono component system which is most likely caused by the increased competitive adsorption from the other metal ions this was further supported because the rf of cd2 in the quaternary system was lowest rf 3 88 55 decrease compared with that in the binary and ternary systems the rf of cd2 in the binary systems was lowered to 6 49 25 decrease 7 58 12 decrease and 8 12 6 decrease in the systems of cu2 cd2 pb2 cd2 and cd2 zn2 respectively this decrease shows that the sequence of competition with cd2 was cu2 pb2 zn2 in the binary systems in the ternary systems the rf of cd2 decreased to 3 90 55 decrease 7 34 15 decrease and 6 85 21 decrease in the systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 cu2 cd2 zn2 and pb2 cd2 zn2 respectively the rf decrease of cd2 in the system of cu2 pb2 cd2 had no significant difference p value 0 05 from that in the quaternary system indicating that zn2 had a relatively weaker competition with cd2 also this reaction for cd can be confirmed by the data in the binary systems 3 5 transport of zn2 btcs for zn2 showed a more rapid increase than the other metals tested resulting in an earlier initial breakthrough to the plateau concentration during the injection phase and a faster drop in relative concentration in the flushing phase for all multi component systems compared to the mono component system fig 5 this quick increase and decrease imply that there was more retention of zn2 in the injection phase of the mono component system compared to the other systems the complete btcs of zn2 were observed during the 30 day experiment period in all systems except in the mono component system the competitive adsorption caused the decrease in the rf of zn2 the primary justification is that the rf of zn2 significantly decreased from 17 32 in the mono component system to 1 50 91 decrease in quaternary system these data show that the mobility of zn2 was higher in the quaternary system the rf of zn2 decreased to 2 06 88 decrease 1 73 90 decrease and 2 71 84 decrease in the binary systems of cu2 zn2 pb2 zn2 and cd2 zn2 respectively this shows that the sequence of competition for active adsorption sites with zn2 was pb2 cu2 cd2 the rf of zn2 was 1 68 90 decrease 1 99 89 decrease and 1 84 89 decrease in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 zn2 cu2 cd2 zn2 and pb2 cd2 zn2 respectively the difference in the rf of zn2 was not statistically significant p value 0 05 in the ternary systems this indicates that the other two metal ionic species had similar effects of competitive adsorption for zn2 retention during the injection phase 3 6 competitive adsorption during transport the adsorbed cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 in the columns for the mono component systems were 0 038 mmol g 0 061 mmol g 0 013 mmol g and 0 026 mmol g respectively table 3 it can be inferred that the sequence of adsorption by the pac apam wtrs from greatest to least under the conditions of steady state saturated flow was pb2 cu2 zn2 cd2 previous studies of ft ir spectroscopy showed that carboxyl groups from the apam in wtrs as well as fe al o functional groups and oh groups simultaneously participated in the adsorption reactions 23 the affinity sequence of the four metal ions adsorbed onto pac apam wtrs followed the sequence of the first hydrolysis constants of pb 7 8 cu 8 0 zn 9 0 cd 10 1 42 43 it is recognized that the degree of these heavy metals being hydrolyzed was the major factor determining the retention of metal ions 42 which also determined the mobility in the mono component systems in the columns the presence of other heavy metal ions caused a decrease of the adsorbed amount of a metal in the quaternary system most of the binary systems and the ternary systems due to possible competitive adsorption during the co transport the adsorbed quantity of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 in the columns of the quaternary system were 0 011 mmol g 71 decrease 0 023 mmol g 62 decrease 0 006 mmol g 55 decrease and 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease respectively these data show that the sequence of affinity onto pac apam wtrs in the quaternary system was pb2 cu2 cd2 zn2 which was different from that found in the mono component systems this implies that the predominant adsorption of pb2 hinders the adsorption cu2 cd2 and zn2 onto the surface of pac apam wtrs and promote the transport of those three ions these results are similar to the findings 2 in which they found that the presence of pb2 reduced the adsorption of cu2 and zn2 through competition for active sites on the silica sand and kaolinite colloids the presence of pb2 also impedes the adsorption of zn2 ni2 and mn2 during the transport in lateritic soil columns 1 and the adsorption of cd2 in an agricultural soil 44 it is found in this study that the selectivity order adsorbed by pac apam wtrs was positively correlated with the pauling s electronegativity of the metals with higher electronegativity being more favorable the electronegativity order of these four metal ions is pb2 2 33 cu2 1 95 cd2 1 69 zn2 1 63 45 in the binary systems the adsorbed cu2 by the columns decreased to 0 017 mmol g 55 decrease 0 018 mmol g 53 decrease and 0 031 mmol g 18 decrease in the cu2 pb2 system the cu2 cd2 system and the cu2 zn2 system respectively no significant difference of the adsorbed cu2 was found between the cu2 pb2 system and the cu2 cd2 system p value 0 05 but the destructive effect of zn2 on cu2 was obviously less than pb2 and cd2 the co existence of pb2 with the other heavy metal ions decreased the adsorbed pb2 in the columns with significant difference to 0 016 mmol g 74 decrease 0 024 mmol g 61 decrease and 0 029 mmol g 52 decrease within the cu2 pb2 the pb2 cd2 and the pb2 zn2 systems respectively the adsorbed cd2 decreased to 0 010 mmol g 24 decrease and 0 012 mmol g 8 decrease within the cu2 cd2 and the pb2 cd2 systems respectively due to the destructive effects of cu2 and pb2 however zn2 demonstrated no significant impact on the adsorption of cd2 in the cd2 zn2 system 1 decrease the competitive adsorption possibly caused the decrease of the zn2 retention in the column to 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease and 0 007 mmol g 73 decrease in the cu2 zn2 the pb2 zn2 and the cd2 zn2 systems respectively the destructive effect of cu2 and pb2 on the adsorption of zn2 was approximately identical but significantly higher than that found for cd2 in the ternary systems the adsorbed cu2 was reduced to 0 011 mmol g 71 decrease 0 012 mmol g 68 decrease and 0 016 mmol g 58 decrease in the cu2 pb2 cd2 the cu2 pb2 zn2 and the cu2 cd2 zn2 systems respectively it is noted that the adsorbed cu2 in the cu2 pb2 cd2 system was not significantly different p value 0 05 from that in the quaternary system this difference implies that the competition effect of zn2 on cu2 was minimal or even negligible in the quaternary system the adsorbed pb2 was reduced to 0 020 mmol g 67 decrease 0 020 mmol g 67 decrease and 0 030 mmol g 51 decrease in the ternary systems of cu2 pb2 cd2 cu2 pb2 zn2 and pb2 cd2 zn2 respectively both combinations of cu2 and cd2 and cu2 and zn2 had identical reduction effects on the pb2 adsorption in the ternary system while the cd2 and zn2 combination had less reduction effect the adsorbed cd2 decreased to 0 006 mmol g 55 decrease 0 011 mmol g 18 decrease and 0 011 mmol g 18 decrease in the cu2 pb2 cd2 the cu2 cd2 zn2 and the pb2 cd2 zn2 systems respectively note that the decrease in the cu2 pb2 cd2 system was not significantly different p value 0 05 than that found in the quaternary system the reduction effect of cu2 and pb2 together on cd2 was obviously higher than the other two combinations the retention of zn2 in the column of pac apam wtrs had no significant difference p value 0 05 in the cu2 pb2 zn2 system 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease and the pb2 cd2 zn2 system 0 005 mmol g 81 decrease which was also not significantly different p value 0 05 from that in the quaternary system the retention of zn2 was slightly higher in the cu2 cd2 zn2 system 0 006 mmol g 77 decrease the cu2 adsorption is more related to the inner sphere complexation while the adsorption of cd2 and zn2 are caused by the outer sphere complexation 46 cd2 often shares the same active sites with zn2 with a relatively strong competition 46 the mobility sequence of zn2 cd2 cu2 in the cu2 cd2 zn2 system found in this study is consistent with that reported by lin and xu 11 in the columns of layered saturated soil the results of a study on the effects of pine bark as a biosorbent on the transport of cu pb zn ni and cd in the heavy metal contaminated soils demonstrated that pb had the highest retention capacity while zn had the lowest retention capacity in the soil columns 47 that was consistent with the finding from this study most of btcs of heavy metals figs 2 5 had a fast increasing front of relative concentration up to the plateau in the retention phase and a rapid drop with a long tail in the flushing phase this shows the non linearity in adsorption during transport especially in the mono component systems 1 and that the faster adsorption time than residence time and the slower release from the adsorption sites to the solution were kinetically controlled 46 more coincidence between the arrival part and the inverted elution part in the binary ternary and quaternary systems than in the mono component systems figs 2 5 demonstrates the significant impacts of non linearity adsorption on the detention and mobility of a heavy metal in pac apam wtrs columns with the presence of other metals 1 the results of mass recovery table 3 show that the adsorption of a heavy metal except cd2 became more reversible and may be weaker when there was a presence of other heavy metals especially when compared to the adsorption from the mono component systems because mass recovery for a heavy metal in the mono component system was lower than that in the other systems 1 3 7 implication of engineering application given that pac apam wtrs are reused as a specific layered media in a stormwater bioretention system with an aim to simultaneously removing various heavy metal ions in stormwater runoff stormwater managers should be aware that the presence of some heavy metal ionic species in the stormwater runoff would increase the mobility of other heavy metal ionic species in the pac apam wtrs layer of a stormwater bioretention system once the concentrations of those heavy metal ions in stormwater runoff are sufficiently high zn2 may be more readily transported through the pac apam wtrs layer under the conditions of long time saturated steady state flow thus stormwater managers should assess the difference between the concentration of leached zn2 and other heavy metal ions from the stormwater bioretention systems and the allowed concentrations in the receiving waters and further determine whether additional engineering strategies are to be conducted during stormwater events in contrast pb2 may be more easily retained in the pac apam wtrs layer compared with other heavy metal ions the longevity of the pac apam wtrs layer should be assessed and predicted based on the performance of pb2 removal and transport in the management of a stormwater bioretention system with pac apam wtrs as a media layer 4 conclusions transport of cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 was investigated in mono component binary ternary and quaternary systems in columns containing pac apam wtrs based on the analysis of the retention phase of the breakthrough curve the retention sequence in the mono component systems was pb2 cu2 zn2 cd2 which was consistent with the sequence of the first hydrolysis constant of these four heavy metals however the selectivity order of metal ion adsorption in the quaternary system was governed by the electronegativity with a higher electronegativity being more favorable to adsorption accordingly the mobility of heavy metals through pac apam wtrs was in the order of zn2 cd2 cu2 pb2 the decrease in the adsorbed amount of a metal ion in all binary ternary and quaternary systems indicated the competitive adsorption occurred which reduced both the retardation factor and the average maximum adsorption capacity thus facilitated transport it is inferred that the presence of some heavy metals in the stormwater runoff would increase the mobility of other metals in the pac apam wtrs layer of a bioretention system credit authorship contribution

13177,the pollution problem of livestock manure generated by the rapid development of farming industry is becoming more and more serious and its conversion into functional materials through a new way is of great practical significance for its resource utilization for the first time nano zero valent iron nzvi biochar composites fe rmc 850 were prepared by carbonizing fe3o4 rabbit dung and used to activate pms for degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx the results showed that fe rmc 850 had high catalytic activity due to its rich pore high graphitization and defective structure when the dosage of fe rmc 850 and pms were 0 3 g l and 0 25 g l respectively the degradation rate of smx could reach 100 within 20 min and it still showed good catalytic stability after 5 cycles of experiments the radical quenching epr and xps results showed that radical and nonradical pathways acted synergistically in the degradation of smx in which nzvi fe2 biochar and pyridinic n were used as the main active sites of the radical pathway the nonradical pathway was attributed to the generation of c o and coo by the oxygen containing functional groups on the biochar surface moreover the inherent p atoms formed pc and cpo3 c2po2 thereby producing defective structures while the graphitic carbon layer provided good electron transfer sites consequently this study provides a nzvi rabbit manure biochar composite pms catalytic material with high organic pollutant degradation efficiency and offers a new option for the resource utilization of manure sources graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords peroxymonosulfate sulfamethoxazole nzvi rabbit manure radical pathway nonradical pathway 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx a typical sulfonamide antibiotic is widely used in medical and animal husbandry fields because of its broad antibacterial spectrum strong bactericidal properties and ease of use 1 2 however its absorption by humans or animals is very limited and the vast majority of smx is excreted into environmental media in the form of prodrugs or metabolites due to its stable molecular structure and strong antibacterial properties it is difficult to meet the emission requirements of traditional biological treatment 3 in recent years smx has been frequently detected in wastewater 4 so it is particularly important to investigate economical and efficient methods for treating smx wastewater at present the main methods for removing smx from wastewater include membrane separation 5 adsorption 6 reverse osmosis 7 and chemical oxidation 8 among which chemical oxidation is favored by researchers due to its simple operating conditions and good treatment effect advanced oxidation processes aops based on activated peroxymonosulfate pms are advanced oxidation technologies with so 4 radicals as the main reactive group these processes are widely used for the removal of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater due to their long half life high oxidation capacity and wide ph tolerance range 9 10 ultrasound uv light activated carbon transition metals and their oxides have been used to activate pms to produce so 4 11 12 with nano zero valent iron nzvi representing a more promising pms activator because of its high redox potential and environmental friendliness however nzvi alone is less stable resulting in its low activation effect 13 the use of carbon supported nzvi materials can effectively overcome this drawback and the graphite structure of carbon materials can provide good electron transfer sites to further improve the activation efficiency of pms 14 at present most researchers use carbon nanotubes graphene and activated carbon as support materials however the complicated preparation process and high price limit their wide application so the search for a new green economical carbon material with excellent catalytic properties is crucial biochar is an excellent carbon carrier for zero valent iron based catalysts due to its excellent chemical stability and defective structure 15 16 in recent years the preparation of nzvi biochar composites by carbon thermal reduction under low oxygen or anaerobic conditions instead of the traditional liquid phase reduction method has become a hot research topic liu et al 17 successfully reduced high valent iron species to nzvi by carbothermal reduction using pine wood chips and hematite as precursors while forming nzvi biochar composites jiang et al 18 prepared nzvi biochar by mixing sawdust and different concentrations of fecl3 6h2o which was used to degrade bisphenol a and the results showed that the iron compound facilitated the formation of nanofibers from biochar during pyrolysis and promoted its activation of pms through a nonradical pathway dai et al 19 prepared 2d nzvi biochar composites by pyrolysis of lignocellulose mixed with fe3 under anaerobic conditions they showed that the strong activation ability of 2d nzvi biochar composites towards pms was related to the nzvi and graphitized structure of biochar however these studies were all based on plant sources and no studies have been reported on the preparation of nzvi biochar for the activation of pms using rabbit manure of animal origin and fe3o4 as a high valent iron source china is a large agricultural country and with the development of china s livestock and poultry farming industry the accompanying problem of rabbit manure pollution is becoming increasingly serious rabbit manure contains a large amount of nitrogen phosphorus sulfur and pathogenic microorganisms and untreated manure entering the environment not only produces irritating and foul smelling gases that pollute the air but also leads to eutrophication of water bodies if rabbit manure is used as a carbon based support material for nzvi it can enhance the activation efficiency of nzvi biochar for pms and its inherent heteroatom doping can enhance the electron donating ability of carbon planes 20 representing a new way for the resource utilization of manure therefore in this study a new carbon encapsulated nzvi composite catalytic material was prepared by carbonizing fe3o4 rabbit manure to reveal the main active sites and influence mechanism of nzvi biochar activation of pms based on comparative analysis of the catalyst crystal structure degree of graphitization elemental species and morphology degradation experiments were used to verify the production of reactive oxidants during oxidative decomposition of smx by nzvi biochar activated pms combined with epr and xps analyses to elucidate the degradation mechanism of smx in the nzvi biochar pms system the potential of the catalyst application was investigated through cycle experiments to provide theoretical and technical basis for the design and development of new efficient stable clean and low cost iron based biochar catalysts for application in aops 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials rabbit manure was obtained from a farm in pixian sichuan province

the magnetic biochar composite catalytic material was subsequently obtained by coprecipitation using naoh solution in the following steps â  fix fe ii fe iii as 1 2 and 2 5 g of rabbit dung dissolve 1 61 g of fe no3 3 9h2o and 0 56 g of feso4 7h2o in 250 ml beaker 100 ml deionized water the mixture was heated in a water bath to 80 c and stirred continuously for 20 min â¡ next naoh 1 mol l solution was added dropwise to the mixture to increase the ph to 10 11 to precipitate the iron oxides and the dark brown solution was stirred further for 1 h â¢ after the solution was cooled the precipitate was repeatedly washed with ethanol and then washed with deionized water until the filtrate was neutral centrifuged and dried for 96 h to obtain the magnetic rabbit feces composite which was named fe3o4 rm fe3o4 rm was placed in a tube furnace and repeatedly evacuated three times to ensure that the furnace was under vacuum fe3o4 rm was heated to 650 750 and 850 c at a constant n2 flow rate 120 ml min and a temperature gradient of 10 c min 1 and kept at a constant temperature for 2 h after cooling under n2 protection washed three times with methanol and deionized water respectively and dried to obtain carbon encapsulated fe named fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 respectively 2 3 characterization the surface properties morphology composition and crystal structure of materials are important factors affecting the samples efficiency and it is important to be familiar with relevant characterization methods for example the samples surface morphology was observed by scanning

impedance spectroscopy eis identification system electron transfer situation electrochemical workstation chi660 2 4 experimental procedures sequential batch experiments investigated the performance of samples in the removal of smx one hundred milliliters 10 mg l of smx solution was placed in a 250 ml beaker and warmed to 25 c and then 30 mg of samples and 25 mg of pms were added simultaneously for magnetic stirring one milliliter of the samples at specific time intervals and filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane into a 2 0 ml hplc vial and an excess of na2s2o3 was quickly mixed for quenching adjustment of solution ph with naoh or hno3 0 1 m when examining the effect of solution ph of the performance of samples in removing smx to examine the reusability of the catalyst the samples were separated from the solution with a magnet repeatedly washed and dried for the next reaction in the radical quenching tests phenol bq nan3 meoh tba nb were used as quenching agents to remove the active material from the reaction the concentration of smx in the solution was determined by hplc equipped with a c18 column smx detection was performed at 270 nm and the mobile phase consisted of glacial acetic acid and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 7 ml min 1 in a 60 40 volume ratio all experiments were performed 3 times in parallel tests to reduce errors 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalyst the crystal structures of samples prepared under different conditions were analyzed by xrd as shown in fig 1 a samples showed typical peaks attributed to graphitic carbon 2Î¸ 26 2 fe3o4 2Î¸ 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 62 5 feo 2Î¸ 41 7 61 9 and metallic fe 2Î¸ 44 7 65 19 fe3o4 rm shows significant diffraction peaks at 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 and 62 5 indicating that fe3o4 had been successfully loaded onto the rabbit manure the peaks of feo were found in fe3o4 rm pyrolyzed at 650 c when the temperature increased to 750 c the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 and feo gradually weakened followed by stronger peaks of metallic fe and as the temperature rose further to 850 c the crystalline phases of fe3o4 and feo disappeared the phase change of the iron species suggested that the increase in carbonization temperature favors the pyrolysis of biomass to produce reducing substances h2 co and amorphous carbon to reduce the high valent fe in fe3o4 to the low valent state and form nzvi biochar composites 21 in addition no graphitic peaks appeared on fe3o4 rm while graphitic carbon peaks appeared on fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 and increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature indicating that the pyrolysis temperature also has an important influence on the carbon structure to further explore the structural characteristics of samples raman spectra were obtained and the results are shown in fig 1 b the fe3o4 rm spectra showed a smooth upward trend without any characteristic peaks while fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 showed pronounced characteristic peaks at 1351 cm 1 d band and 1599 cm 1 g band usually the d band indicates defects in the c atom lattice the g band indicates the sp2 hybridized carbon structure and the intensity ratio id ig reflects the degree of graphitization and defects in the carbon materials 22 fe3o4 rm was fully saturated and free of defects and graphitic structures and when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 650 c and 750 c the id ig values of fe rmc 650 and fe rmc 750 increased to 2 49 and 2 59 respectively the higher id ig values indicated that fe rmc 650 and fe rmc 750 had more unsaturated defect sites which might be related to the enhanced disordered defectivity of the biochar surface due to the promotion of porous structure formation by fe species at high temperatures 23 however when the temperature was further increased to 850 c the id ig value corresponding to fe rmc 850 decreased to 2 41 indicating a high degree of graphitization of the fe rmc 850 carbon layer and generating more sp2 hybridized carbon structures which was consistent with the xrd analysis results the raman analysis results indicated that there were a large number of defective sites in the fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 carbon layers which were conducive to the generation of singly linear oxygen through the activation of the pms form by the nonradical pathway at the same time the highly graphitized structure of fe rmc 850 could generate a large number of freely movable Ï electrons and accelerate the electron flow which might be the reason why the fe rmc 850 activated pms degrades smx more efficiently than that activated by fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm 21 the sem images of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 are shown in fig 2 from fig 2 a d it could be seen that the surface of fe3o4 rm was smooth with no mesopores the block structure of fe rmc 650 increased fe rmc 750 showed mesopores and micropores and the surface of fe rmc 850 was rough and uneven with an increased number of mesopores and micropores per unit area from fig 2 e h it can be seen that larger sizes of fe3o4 were present on the fe3o4 rm surface as the pyrolysis temperature increased the iron species were encapsulated in the carbon layer and the iron crystals per unit area increased significantly these phenomena suggested that higher temperatures favor the formation of rich pore structures while accelerating the production of large scale iron nanoparticles combined with the hrtem pattern of fe rmc 850 fig 3 c the lattice spacing of the nanoparticles was 0 206 nm which corresponded to the 110 crystallographic plane of fe0 while as seen in fig 3 a and b these dark spherical clusters of fe0 were tightly wrapped by layers of carbon nanoparticles which were measured to have a lattice spacing of 0 329 nm corresponding to the 002 crystallographic plane of graphitic carbon the hrtem test results showed that fe3o4 was thermally reduced to fe0 by carbon at higher temperatures and wrapped around the crystals by graphitic carbon layers to form a core shell structure consistent with the xrd and raman results eds determined the elemental composition and content of fe rmc 850 and the results are shown in fig 3 d i fe rmc 850 contained a large amount of c and a small amount of o fe si cu n and p where c o n p and fe were uniformly distributed in the carbon layer to further illustrate the chemical state of the elements contained in the catalyst xps analysis of fe rmc 850 was performed and the results are shown in fig 4 a e the fe 2p core level for fresh fe rmc 850 at 708 7 ev was attributed to fe0 the peaks at approximately 713 712 3 ev and 725 8 ev were generated by fe 2p2 3 and fe 2p1 2 of fe3 respectively and those at 710 4 ev and 723 9 ev correspond to typical fe 2p2 3 and fe 2p1 2 levels of fe2 the production of fe2 and fe3 on fe rmc 850 might be due to the oxidation of fe0 during preservation from fig 4 b the xps c 1s peaks at 284 7 285 6 286 0 and 289 3 ev were attributed to cc and cc 49 91 ch 21 75 c oh 17 85 and cooh 10 49 groups respectively the co group on biochar can promote the decomposition of pms and generate 1o2 while the large amount of sp2 c facilitates the charge transfer as shown in fig 4 c the o 1s spectra of fe rmc 850 showed three peaks of oxygen at approximately 530 2 531 5 and 532 4 ev corresponding to lattice oxygen oi oh component oxygen oii and oxygen in adsorbed water oiii respectively the abundant content of oi is easy for hydroxylation reaction to produce 1o2 doped heteroatoms with distinct atomic radii and orbitals electron densities and electronegativities could effectively change the electronic structure of the original carbon planes breaking their chemical inertness and introducing new active sites the fit revealed four peaks n 1s fig 4 d at 397 9 399 7 400 9 and 403 9 ev corresponding to pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and oxidative n respectively and that the different forms of n increase the fermi energy level of carbon enhancing the electron transfer capacity of carbon and thus the catalytic efficiency 24 and the spectrum of p 2p fig 4 e at 132 7 133 5 and 134 2 ev corresponding to pc cpo3 c2po2 and po structures respectively the p atom has a larger atomic radius and forms a longer cp than cn so p doping favors the creation of more defect sites 25 the specific surface area and pore size distribution of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 were determined by nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms as shown in fig 5 and table 1 the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm of fe3o4 rm was type ii indicating a nonporous structure while fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 all showed type iv isotherms and obvious hysteresis lines appeared at p p0 0 4 1 indicating the existence of mesoporous pore size 2 nm and microporous 2 50 nm structures on the surfaces of fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 26 this layered porous structure could effectively weaken the mass transfer resistance and promote the accelerated transport of reactants to the catalyst surface 27 the pore size distribution map further confirms the presence of an abundant porous structure of samples with this layered porous structure becoming more pronounced with increasing pyrolysis temperature combined with table 1 it was seen that the specific surface area of fe rmc 850 was 1 36 2 66 and 4 91 times that of fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm respectively and the total pore volume was 1 27 2 38 and 3 80 times that of fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm respectively the reason might be that the more complete decomposition of organic matter and other volatiles at higher temperatures allows fe rmc 850 to have a larger specific surface area and total pore volume thus providing more sites for pms adsorption and catalytic activity 3 2 comparison of the catalytic performance of different materials the pyrolysis temperature not only affects the surface morphological characteristics of biochar but also determines the crystal structure of iron species by studying the performance of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 in degrading smx the correlation between the pyrolysis parameters and the degradation efficiency was established as shown in fig 6 the effect of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 on smx in the absence of pms was attributed to static adsorption and the smx removal efficiencies of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 were 13 19 67 25 2 and 30 in 40 min respectively when pms was present alone the smx concentration was almost unchanged and when pms coexisted with fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 smx showed a significant decreasing trend at 40 min the removal of smx by e3o4 rm fe rmc 650 and fe rmc 750 reached 51 3 80 4 and 92 8 respectively while the removal of smx by fe rmc 850 showed nearly 100 removal of smx at 25 min the results of this study showed that pms itself did not degrade smx while fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 were all effective in catalyzing pms to produce strong oxidative radicals to degrade smx combined with the kinetic fitting results fig 6 b it could be seen that the degradation of smx by pms catalyzed by fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 conformed to the pseudo first order kinetic model while the kinetic constants kobs values of fe rmc 850 were 1 90 4 71 and 12 24 times higher than those of fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm respectively with the strongest catalytic activity with increasing pyrolysis temperature fe rmc 850 possesses a larger specific surface and a richer pore structure providing more sites for pms adsorption and catalytic activity while the highly graphitized and defective structure might lead to nonradical pathways and facilitate electron transfer therefore fe rmc 850 was chosen as the catalyst in the subsequent study 3 3 effect of catalyst and pms dosing temperature and ph the effect of catalyst dosage on the catalytic degradation performance of smx is shown in fig 7 a the degradation rate of smx increased gradually with increasing fe rmc 850 dose and then leveled off when the dose of fe rmc 850 was increased from 0 1 to 0 2 g l the degradation rate of smx increased from 67 to 95 and kobs increased from 0 039 to 0 097 min 1 in 30 min when the dose of fe rmc 850 was increased to 0 3 g l smx was completely degraded in 25 min and its kobs reached 0 248 min 1 while when fe rmc 850 continued to be increased to 0 4 g l the corresponding kobs was 0 253 min 1 which was only 0 005 higher than the kobs value at 0 3 g l the analysis concluded that when the fe rmc 850 was 0 1 0 3 g l the larger catalyst concentration in the solution provided more active sites for pms and accelerated the rate of radical generation and with the excessive increase in dosage it might lead to insufficient pms concentration in solution or self quenching with so4 and oh eqs 1 3 making the improvement of degradation efficiency not obvious 28 considering the degradation rate and economics the dosage of fe rmc 850 was selected as 0 3 g l for subsequent experiments the effect of pms dosing on the performance of catalytic degradation of smx is shown in fig 7 b when the pms dosage was 0 1 0 25 g l the degradation rate of smx increased with increasing pms dosage and the corresponding kobs increased from 0 053 to 0 2611 min 1 this was because increasing the pms dosage could form more active substances to participate in the reaction however when the pms concentration continued to increase to 0 35 g l smx was still completely degraded within 25 min but its kobs dropped to 0 2475 min 1 probably because too much pms reacted with so4 and oh to form so5 which has a weaker redox potential eqs 4 and 5 29 decreasing the reaction rate therefore a pms dose of 0 25 g l was chosen for the subsequent experiment 1 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 oh hs o 5 3 oh oh h 2 o 2 4 hs o 5 s o 4 s o 4 2 s o 5 h 5 hs o 5 oh s o 5 h 2 o the effect of different temperatures on the catalytic degradation performance of smx is shown in fig 7 c the degradation rate of smx increased with the increase of the system temperature and when the solution temperature was 55 c smx was completely degraded in 15 min the kobs values at 25 35 45 and 55 c were 0 2559 0 3036 0 3419 and 0 4227 min 1 respectively the ease of reaction is usually judged by the reaction activation energy ea the lower the ea value is the easier the reaction will be the ea of fe rmc 850 was calculated by eq 6 as 13 7284 kj mol which was significantly lower than the activation energy values of reported pms catalysts such as graphene 43 8 kj mol and carbon nanotubes 80 4 kj mol 30 indicating that fe rmc 850 had a strong activation potential for pms 6 ln k ln a e a r 1 t the different ph of the solution not only determine the type of transition metal formation but also influence the process of radical generation by pms decomposition which in turn affects the degradation efficiency the effect of different ph on the performance of catalytic degradation of smx is shown in fig 7 d at ph 3 9 the degradation rate of smx increased with increasing ph the best degradation effect was achieved at ph 9 where smx was completely degraded in 15 min with a kobs value of 0 3462 min 1 at ph 9 10 the degradation rate of smx decreased significantly and the kobs value at ph 9 was 13 times higher than that at ph 10 analysis suggests that there were two isopotentials for pms pka1 0 pka2 9 when the ph was low pms was present as hso5 31 and high concentrations of h readily formed hydrogen bonds with the peroxide bond oo in hso5 inhibiting the interaction with fe rmc 850 and resulting in poor smx degradation rates with increasing ph the competitive advantage of h decreases and the smx degradation rate gradually increases while at ph 9 higher oh quenches so4 to produce less oxidizable oh decreasing the reaction efficiency 32 3 4 effects of inorganic anions and humic acid various soluble inorganic anions are widely present in natural waters and these anions may have a significant influence on the degradation process due to their specific properties therefore cl so 4 2 and hco 3 0 10 30 and 50 mm were chosen to investigate their effect on the catalytic performance as shown in fig 8 a the degradation process was significantly promoted by cl with kobs values increasing from 0 2573 to 0 4267 min 1 when the cl was 0 50 mm which might be because higher concentrations of cl readily react with pms to form hocl cl2 eqs 7 9 and the synergistic effect of hocl cl2 with free radicals improves the catalytic efficiency 33 as shown in fig 8 b the smx removal rate showed a decreasing trend with increasing so 4 2 concentration indicating that so 4 2 was able to trap free radicals to inhibit the degradation reaction eq 10 34 the effect of hco 3 on the removal rate of smx is shown in 8 c when hco 3 10 30 mm there was a strong inhibition of smx degradation and with increasing hco 3 concentration the inhibition decreased when hco 3 50 mm the inhibition disappeared and there was a slight promotion smx was completely reduced after 20 min and its kobs value rose to 0 3095 min 1 analysis suggested that in the presence of lower hco 3 concentrations hco 3 and its resulting co 3 2 consume the more oxidizing so4 and oh producing hco 3 and co 3 with lower redox sites thereby reducing the efficiency of the reaction eqs 11 13 with increasing hco 3 concentration the rise in solution ph promotes the decomposition of pms to produce so5 2 to enhance the removal efficiency eq 14 35 humic acid ha a natural organic substance is widely present in secondary effluent from sewage treatment plants and in surface water sources as seen from the fig 8 d there was a slight inhibition of the degradation of smx by ha with kobs values of 0 2616 0 1936 0 1576 and 0 1048 min 1 at ha concentrations of 0 5 10 and 20 mg l respectively which might be related to the highly aromatized and abundant alicyclic structure of ha being prone to form Ï Ï bonds with the catalyst to occupy adsorption sites and catalytically active sites or competition with smx for free radicals 36 37 7 hs o 5 2 c l s o 4 2 hocl 8 hs o 5 2 c l h s o 4 2 c l 2 h 2 o 9 c l 2 aq h 2 o hocl h cl 10 so 4 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 e aq 11

indicator of catalyst performance the catalyst was separated by an applied magnetic field at the end of each reaction repeatedly washed and dried and then continued to be used in catalytic degradation experiments with the results shown in fig 9 in three replicate experiments the removal rate at 20 min was 99 99 and 98 and the catalytic efficiency remained the same at four replicates smx removal rate at 20 min dropped to 92 at five replicates smx removal rate at 20 min dropped to 83 but the removal rate of 97 could be achieved within 30 min the analysis concluded that the following occurred as the number of cycles increased â  the functional groups on the surface of fe rmc 850 were destroyed â¡ the smx degradation intermediates blocked the catalyst active sites 38 resulting in a slight decrease in catalytic activity but fe rmc 850 still showed strong catalytic performance after five cycles indicating that fe rmc 850 has good potential for application 3 6 reactive oxygen species identification alcohols with Î± h atoms present such as methanol meoh usually have strong reaction rate with oh and so4 and could therefore rapidly quench both radicals in contrast tert butanol tba which has no Î± h reacts quickly with oh and have a weaker quenching effect for so4 because their reaction rate with oh is thousands of times higher than that of so4 39 as seen from the fig 10 a when meoh and tba were added to the fe rmc 850 pms system smx removal rate decreased from 100 to 82 and 73 respectively in 30 min tba had a slight but not significant inhibition advantage over meoh probably because meoh is a hydrophilic compound and cannot collect on and around the surface of the solid phase catalyst in a large area in a solid liquid two phase nonhomogeneous system at the same time fe rmc 850 could be characterized by the presence of a large number of mesoporous microporous and layered structures that could provide large reaction sites for electrons reactants resulting in the inability of meoh to quench the radicals on the surface of fe rmc 850 40 when a certain concentration of phenol was added phenol pms molar ratio 1000 1 only 53 smx was degraded in 30 min so it could be confirmed that the degradation process occurred mainly on and around the catalyst surface in order to distinguish which is the dominant role of so4 and oh in the fe rmc 850 pms system nitrobenzene nb was used as the oh scavenger and the smx removal rate was 84 within 30 min indicating that a small amount of oh was formed in the fe rmc 850 pms system indicating that the role of oh in the fe rmc 850 pms system is less while so4 was the main contributor for the possible presence of o 2 and 1o2 p benzoquinone bq and nan3 were used as quenching agents for o 2 and 1o2 respectively as seen from the graphs the degradation rates of smx in 30 min were 89 and 56 when bq and l h were present respectively indicating that o 2 and 1o2 were involved in the degradation reaction and 1o2 had a greater influence on the degradation process further verification of the so4 oh o 2 and 1o2 generation in the fe rmc 850 pms system by epr spectroscopy dmpo and temp were utilized to capture so4 and oh as well as o 2 and 1o2 respectively 41 as seen from the fig 10 b four characteristic peaks of dmpo oh with a peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were detected in the fe rmc 850 pms system and six characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 with a peak intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 1 1 were also present 42 while the presence of the o 2 characteristic signal in fig 10 c further supports the inference that o 2 was involved in the reaction process a triple peak with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 could be observed when temp was used as the trapping agent fig 10 d directly verifying the presence of 1o2 43 thus based on the above results it was clear that both radical and nonradical pathways contribute significantly to the degradation process 3 7 catalytic mechanism to further investigate the mechanism of the structural characteristics of the catalyst surface and the fe species on the degradation of smx by activated pms xps analysis was performed on fe rmc 850 before and after the reaction as seen from the fig 11 a e after the reaction the peaks at fe0 disappeared indicating the involvement of fe0 in the reaction the intensity of the peak at fe2 weakened while that corresponding to fe3 increased significantly and the location of the peak changed indicating that fe2 was partially converted to fe3 during the reaction the proportions of c oh and cooh decreased to 9 16 and 16 06 after the reaction fig 11 b indicating that both c oh and cooh were involved in the degradation process 44 as shown in fig 11 c the percentage of oi decreased from 51 85 to 14 11 while that of oii and oiii increased from 29 55 and 18 6 to 35 26 and 50 63 respectively indicating that fe rmc 850 underwent a strong hydroxylation reaction in the degradation experiment 45 in addition after the reaction fig 11 d e the pyridinic n content decreased from 31 81 to 15 17 indicating that pyridinic n was depleted as the main active n while pc cpo3 c2po2 decreased from 39 93 and 23 26 to 23 5 and 4 49 respectively indicating that both pc and cpo3 c2po2 could be used as new active sites for pms activation therefore based on the results of quenching experiments and xps analysis two possible pathways for the degradation of smx by fe rmc 850 activated pms were proposed namely the radical pathway and the nonradical pathway â  radical pathway fe0 functional aspects fe0 could act as a good redox mediator to provide electrons to pms to generate so4 and oh eqs 15 18 while fe0 could accelerate the rate of fe3 fe2 conversion and further enhancing the electron giving ability to activate pms to produce more so4 and oh eq 19 fe2 bc was hydroxylated in the aqueous phase to generate fe2 oh which forms the complex fe2 ho oso3 through ligand substitution and finally decomposes to produce so4 eqs 20 21 46 according to the bq quenching tests the production of o 2 was attributed to the reaction of so5 2 with h2o eqs 22 23 carbon structure aspects pyridinic n could promote Ï electron transfer in the sp2 hybridized carbon structure activating pms and generating so4 and oh â¡ nonradical pathway fe0 functional aspects the introduction of fe induces positively charged neighboring carbon atoms and promotes the production of 1o2 47 and the production of o 2 also facilitates the further production of 1o2 eqs 26 28 carbon structure aspects c oh and cooh on the surface of biochar were converted to c o and coo and activated pms to produce 1o2 by releasing free radicals eqs 24 25 on the other hand fe rmc 850 inherent p atom doping forms pc and pc cpo3 c2po2 generates more defective sites to further generate 1o2 and strengthen the nonradical pathway the strong oxidation of so4 oh o 2 and 1o2 produced by the above process oxidizes smx to a series of intermediate products up to mineralization to co2 and h2o eq 29 15 fe 0 2 hs o 5 fe 2 2 s o 4 2 o h 16 fe 2 hs o 5 fe 3 s o 4 2 o h 17 fe 0 o 2 2 h fe 2 h 2 o 2 18 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 o h oh 19 fe 0 2 fe 3 3 fe 2 20 fe 2 o h hs o

non radical pathway that was formed by the transfer of electrons from the organic pollutants to the pms through a conducting medium this result was further confirmed by eis and lsv 48 regarding eis results fig 12 a usually the smaller the radius of the arc of the material is the lower the impedance thus making the charge transfer easier the radius of the arc of the samples decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature rfe rmc 850 rfe rmc 750 rfe rmc 650 indicating that fe rmc 850 generated at high temperature had higher electrical conductivity and charge transfer capability these improvements may be related to the generation of a mesoporous graphitized structure 36 regarding the lsv results fig 12 b the current of the fe rmc 850 pms system was significantly higher than that of only fe rmc 850 indicating that electron transfer occurred between the graphitized structure on fe rmc 850 and pms the current intensity of the fe rmc 850 pms smx system was further enhanced indicating that the current of this fe rmc 850 system was due to electron transfer between pms and smx 49 4 conclusions for the first time fe3o4 rabbit manure was used as a precursor and converted into a high performance pms activation material through an effective pathway and used to treat refractory organic matter in wastewater nzvi biochar composite materials were prepared by carbonizing fe3o4 rabbit manure at different temperatures the results showed that fe rmc 850 possessed a larger specific surface area total pore volume and graphitization degree than fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm as the pyrolysis temperature increased smx 10 mg l was completely degraded in 20 min when pms 0 25 g l fe rmc 850 0 3 g l and t 25 c and the system still had good catalytic activity after 5

13177,the pollution problem of livestock manure generated by the rapid development of farming industry is becoming more and more serious and its conversion into functional materials through a new way is of great practical significance for its resource utilization for the first time nano zero valent iron nzvi biochar composites fe rmc 850 were prepared by carbonizing fe3o4 rabbit dung and used to activate pms for degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx the results showed that fe rmc 850 had high catalytic activity due to its rich pore high graphitization and defective structure when the dosage of fe rmc 850 and pms were 0 3 g l and 0 25 g l respectively the degradation rate of smx could reach 100 within 20 min and it still showed good catalytic stability after 5 cycles of experiments the radical quenching epr and xps results showed that radical and nonradical pathways acted synergistically in the degradation of smx in which nzvi fe2 biochar and pyridinic n were used as the main active sites of the radical pathway the nonradical pathway was attributed to the generation of c o and coo by the oxygen containing functional groups on the biochar surface moreover the inherent p atoms formed pc and cpo3 c2po2 thereby producing defective structures while the graphitic carbon layer provided good electron transfer sites consequently this study provides a nzvi rabbit manure biochar composite pms catalytic material with high organic pollutant degradation efficiency and offers a new option for the resource utilization of manure sources graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords peroxymonosulfate sulfamethoxazole nzvi rabbit manure radical pathway nonradical pathway 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx a typical sulfonamide antibiotic is widely used in medical and animal husbandry fields because of its broad antibacterial spectrum strong bactericidal properties and ease of use 1 2 however its absorption by humans or animals is very limited and the vast majority of smx is excreted into environmental media in the form of prodrugs or metabolites due to its stable molecular structure and strong antibacterial properties it is difficult to meet the emission requirements of traditional biological treatment 3 in recent years smx has been frequently detected in wastewater 4 so it is particularly important to investigate economical and efficient methods for treating smx wastewater at present the main methods for removing smx from wastewater include membrane separation 5 adsorption 6 reverse osmosis 7 and chemical oxidation 8 among which chemical oxidation is favored by researchers due to its simple operating conditions and good treatment effect advanced oxidation processes aops based on activated peroxymonosulfate pms are advanced oxidation technologies with so 4 radicals as the main reactive group these processes are widely used for the removal of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater due to their long half life high oxidation capacity and wide ph tolerance range 9 10 ultrasound uv light activated carbon transition metals and their oxides have been used to activate pms to produce so 4 11 12 with nano zero valent iron nzvi representing a more promising pms activator because of its high redox potential and environmental friendliness however nzvi alone is less stable resulting in its low activation effect 13 the use of carbon supported nzvi materials can effectively overcome this drawback and the graphite structure of carbon materials can provide good electron transfer sites to further improve the activation efficiency of pms 14 at present most researchers use carbon nanotubes graphene and activated carbon as support materials however the complicated preparation process and high price limit their wide application so the search for a new green economical carbon material with excellent catalytic properties is crucial biochar is an excellent carbon carrier for zero valent iron based catalysts due to its excellent chemical stability and defective structure 15 16 in recent years the preparation of nzvi biochar composites by carbon thermal reduction under low oxygen or anaerobic conditions instead of the traditional liquid phase reduction method has become a hot research topic liu et al 17 successfully reduced high valent iron species to nzvi by carbothermal reduction using pine wood chips and hematite as precursors while forming nzvi biochar composites jiang et al 18 prepared nzvi biochar by mixing sawdust and different concentrations of fecl3 6h2o which was used to degrade bisphenol a and the results showed that the iron compound facilitated the formation of nanofibers from biochar during pyrolysis and promoted its activation of pms through a nonradical pathway dai et al 19 prepared 2d nzvi biochar composites by pyrolysis of lignocellulose mixed with fe3 under anaerobic conditions they showed that the strong activation ability of 2d nzvi biochar composites towards pms was related to the nzvi and graphitized structure of biochar however these studies were all based on plant sources and no studies have been reported on the preparation of nzvi biochar for the activation of pms using rabbit manure of animal origin and fe3o4 as a high valent iron source china is a large agricultural country and with the development of china s livestock and poultry farming industry the accompanying problem of rabbit manure pollution is becoming increasingly serious rabbit manure contains a large amount of nitrogen phosphorus sulfur and pathogenic microorganisms and untreated manure entering the environment not only produces irritating and foul smelling gases that pollute the air but also leads to eutrophication of water bodies if rabbit manure is used as a carbon based support material for nzvi it can enhance the activation efficiency of nzvi biochar for pms and its inherent heteroatom doping can enhance the electron donating ability of carbon planes 20 representing a new way for the resource utilization of manure therefore in this study a new carbon encapsulated nzvi composite catalytic material was prepared by carbonizing fe3o4 rabbit manure to reveal the main active sites and influence mechanism of nzvi biochar activation of pms based on comparative analysis of the catalyst crystal structure degree of graphitization elemental species and morphology degradation experiments were used to verify the production of reactive oxidants during oxidative decomposition of smx by nzvi biochar activated pms combined with epr and xps analyses to elucidate the degradation mechanism of smx in the nzvi biochar pms system the potential of the catalyst application was investigated through cycle experiments to provide theoretical and technical basis for the design and development of new efficient stable clean and low cost iron based biochar catalysts for application in aops 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials rabbit manure was obtained from a farm in pixian sichuan province

ruijinte chemicals co ltd china the water used for the experiments was deionized water and the chemical reagents used were all of analytical grade 2 2 catalysts preparation grass soil and other impurities were removed from the rabbit manure and the rabbit manure was crushed washed with ethanol and alkali cleaned with ultrapure water to neutral dried at 85 c and sifted with an 80 mesh sieve the magnetic biochar composite catalytic material was subsequently obtained by coprecipitation using naoh solution in the following steps â  fix fe ii fe iii as 1 2 and 2 5 g of rabbit dung dissolve 1 61 g of fe no3 3 9h2o and 0 56 g of feso4 7h2o in 250 ml beaker 100 ml deionized water the mixture was heated in a water bath to 80 c and stirred continuously for 20 min â¡ next naoh 1 mol l solution was added dropwise to the mixture to increase the ph to 10 11 to precipitate the iron oxides and the dark brown solution was stirred further for 1 h â¢ after the solution was cooled the precipitate was repeatedly washed with ethanol and then washed with deionized water until the filtrate was neutral centrifuged and dried for 96 h to obtain the magnetic rabbit feces composite which was named fe3o4 rm fe3o4 rm was placed in a tube furnace and repeatedly evacuated three times to ensure that the furnace was under vacuum fe3o4 rm was heated to 650 750 and 850 c at a constant n2 flow rate 120 ml min and a temperature gradient of 10 c min 1 and kept at a constant temperature for 2 h after cooling under n2 protection washed three times with methanol and deionized water respectively and dried to obtain carbon encapsulated fe named fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 respectively 2 3 characterization the surface properties morphology composition and crystal structure of materials are important factors affecting the samples efficiency and it is important to be familiar with relevant characterization methods for example the samples surface morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem supra40 high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem fei tecnai g2 f20 and x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the specific surface area pore volume and pore

impedance spectroscopy eis identification system electron transfer situation electrochemical workstation chi660 2 4 experimental procedures sequential batch experiments investigated the performance of samples in the removal of smx one hundred milliliters 10 mg l of smx solution was placed in a 250 ml beaker and warmed to 25 c and then 30 mg of samples and 25 mg of pms were added simultaneously for magnetic stirring one milliliter of the samples at specific time intervals and filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane into a 2 0 ml hplc vial and an excess of na2s2o3 was quickly mixed for quenching adjustment of solution ph with naoh or hno3 0 1 m when examining the effect of solution ph of the performance of samples in removing smx to examine the reusability of the catalyst the samples were separated from the solution with a magnet repeatedly washed and dried for the next reaction in the radical quenching tests phenol bq nan3 meoh tba nb were used as quenching agents to remove the active material from the reaction the concentration of smx in the solution was determined by hplc equipped with a c18 column smx detection was performed at 270 nm and the mobile phase consisted of glacial acetic acid and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 7 ml min 1 in a 60 40 volume ratio all experiments were performed 3 times in parallel tests to reduce errors 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalyst the crystal structures of samples prepared under different conditions were analyzed by xrd as shown in fig 1 a samples showed typical peaks attributed to graphitic carbon 2Î¸ 26 2 fe3o4 2Î¸ 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 62 5 feo 2Î¸ 41 7 61 9 and metallic fe 2Î¸ 44 7 65 19 fe3o4 rm shows significant diffraction peaks at 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 and 62 5 indicating that fe3o4 had been successfully loaded onto the rabbit manure the peaks of feo were found in fe3o4 rm pyrolyzed at 650 c when the temperature increased to 750 c the diffraction peaks of fe3o4 and feo gradually weakened followed by stronger peaks of metallic fe and as the temperature rose further to 850 c the crystalline phases of fe3o4 and feo disappeared the phase change of the iron species suggested that the increase in carbonization temperature favors the pyrolysis of biomass to produce reducing substances h2 co and amorphous carbon to reduce the high valent fe in fe3o4 to the low valent state and form nzvi biochar composites 21 in addition no graphitic peaks appeared on fe3o4 rm while graphitic carbon peaks appeared on fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 and increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature indicating that the pyrolysis temperature also has an important influence on the carbon structure to further explore the structural characteristics of samples raman spectra were obtained and the results are shown in fig 1 b the fe3o4 rm spectra showed a smooth upward trend without any characteristic peaks while fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 showed pronounced characteristic peaks at 1351 cm 1 d band and 1599 cm 1 g band usually the d band indicates defects in the c atom lattice the g band indicates the sp2 hybridized carbon structure and the intensity ratio id ig reflects the degree of graphitization and defects in the carbon materials 22 fe3o4 rm was fully saturated and free of defects and graphitic structures and when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 650 c and 750 c the id ig values of fe rmc 650 and fe rmc 750 increased to 2 49 and 2 59 respectively the higher id ig values indicated that fe rmc 650 and fe rmc 750 had more unsaturated defect sites which might be related to the enhanced disordered defectivity of the biochar surface due to the promotion of porous structure formation by fe species at high temperatures 23 however when the temperature was further increased to 850 c the id ig value corresponding to fe rmc 850 decreased to 2 41 indicating a high degree of graphitization of the fe rmc 850 carbon layer and generating more sp2 hybridized carbon structures which was consistent with the xrd analysis results the raman analysis results indicated that there were a large number of defective sites in the fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 carbon layers which were conducive to the generation of singly linear oxygen through the activation of the pms form by the nonradical pathway at the same time the highly graphitized structure of fe rmc 850 could generate a large number of freely movable Ï electrons and accelerate the electron flow which might be the reason why the fe rmc 850 activated pms degrades smx more efficiently than that activated by fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm 21 the sem images of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 are shown in fig 2 from fig 2 a d it could be seen that the surface of fe3o4 rm was smooth with no mesopores the block structure of fe rmc 650 increased fe rmc 750 showed mesopores and micropores and the surface of fe rmc 850 was rough and uneven with an increased number of mesopores and micropores per unit area from fig 2 e h it can be seen that larger sizes of fe3o4 were present on the fe3o4 rm surface as the pyrolysis temperature increased the iron species were encapsulated in the carbon layer and the iron crystals per unit area increased significantly these phenomena suggested that higher temperatures favor the formation of rich pore structures while accelerating the production of large scale iron nanoparticles combined with the hrtem pattern of fe rmc 850 fig 3 c the lattice spacing of the nanoparticles was 0 206 nm which corresponded to the 110 crystallographic plane of fe0 while as seen in fig 3 a and b these dark spherical clusters of fe0 were tightly wrapped by layers of carbon nanoparticles which were measured to have a lattice spacing of 0 329 nm corresponding to the 002 crystallographic plane of graphitic carbon the hrtem test results showed that fe3o4 was thermally reduced to fe0 by carbon at higher temperatures and wrapped around the crystals by graphitic carbon layers to form a core shell structure consistent with the xrd and raman results eds determined the elemental composition and content of fe rmc 850 and the results are shown in fig 3 d i fe rmc 850 contained a large amount of c and a small amount of o fe si cu n and p where c o n p and fe were uniformly distributed in the carbon layer to further illustrate the chemical state of the elements contained in the catalyst xps analysis of fe rmc 850 was performed and the results are shown in fig 4 a e the fe 2p core level for fresh fe rmc 850 at 708 7 ev was attributed to fe0 the peaks at approximately 713 712 3 ev and 725 8 ev were generated by fe 2p2 3 and fe 2p1 2 of fe3 respectively and those at 710 4 ev and 723 9 ev correspond to typical fe 2p2 3 and fe 2p1 2 levels of fe2 the production of fe2 and fe3 on fe rmc 850 might be due to the oxidation of fe0 during preservation from fig 4 b the xps c 1s peaks at 284 7 285 6 286 0 and 289 3 ev were attributed to cc and cc 49 91 ch 21 75 c oh 17 85 and cooh 10 49 groups respectively the co group on biochar can promote the decomposition of pms and generate 1o2 while the large amount of sp2 c facilitates the charge transfer as shown in fig 4 c the o 1s spectra of fe rmc 850 showed three peaks of oxygen at approximately 530 2 531 5 and 532 4 ev corresponding to lattice oxygen oi oh component oxygen oii and oxygen in adsorbed water oiii respectively the abundant content of oi is easy for hydroxylation reaction to produce 1o2 doped heteroatoms with distinct atomic radii and orbitals electron densities and electronegativities could effectively change the electronic structure of the original carbon planes breaking their chemical inertness and introducing new active sites the fit revealed four peaks n 1s fig 4 d at 397 9 399 7 400 9 and 403 9 ev corresponding to pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and oxidative n respectively and that the different forms of n increase the fermi energy level of carbon enhancing the electron transfer capacity of carbon and thus the catalytic efficiency 24 and the spectrum of p 2p fig 4 e at 132 7 133 5 and 134 2 ev corresponding to pc cpo3 c2po2 and po structures respectively the p atom has a larger atomic radius and forms a longer cp than cn so p doping favors the creation of more defect sites 25 the specific surface area and pore size distribution of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 were determined by nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms as shown in fig 5 and table 1 the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm of fe3o4 rm was type ii indicating a nonporous structure while fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 all showed type iv isotherms and obvious hysteresis lines appeared at p p0 0 4 1 indicating the existence of mesoporous pore size 2 nm and microporous 2 50 nm structures on the surfaces of fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 26 this layered porous structure could effectively weaken the mass transfer resistance and promote the accelerated transport of reactants to the catalyst surface 27 the pore size distribution map further confirms the presence of an abundant porous structure of samples with this layered porous structure becoming more pronounced with increasing pyrolysis temperature combined with table 1 it was seen that the specific surface area of fe rmc 850 was 1 36 2 66 and 4 91 times that of fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm respectively and the total pore volume was 1 27 2 38 and 3 80 times that of fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm respectively the reason might be that the more complete decomposition of organic matter and other volatiles at higher temperatures allows fe rmc 850 to have a larger specific surface area and total pore volume thus providing more sites for pms adsorption and catalytic activity 3 2 comparison of the catalytic performance of different materials the pyrolysis temperature not only affects the surface morphological characteristics of biochar but also determines the crystal structure of iron species by studying the performance of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 in degrading smx the correlation between the pyrolysis parameters and the degradation efficiency was established as shown in fig 6 the effect of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 on smx in the absence of pms was attributed to static adsorption and the smx removal efficiencies of fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 were 13 19 67 25 2 and 30 in 40 min respectively when pms was present alone the smx concentration was almost unchanged and when pms coexisted with fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 smx showed a significant decreasing trend at 40 min the removal of smx by e3o4 rm fe rmc 650 and fe rmc 750 reached 51 3 80 4 and 92 8 respectively while the removal of smx by fe rmc 850 showed nearly 100 removal of smx at 25 min the results of this study showed that pms itself did not degrade smx while fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 were all effective in catalyzing pms to produce strong oxidative radicals to degrade smx combined with the kinetic fitting results fig 6 b it could be seen that the degradation of smx by pms catalyzed by fe3o4 rm fe rmc 650 fe rmc 750 and fe rmc 850 conformed to the pseudo first order kinetic model while the kinetic constants kobs values of fe rmc 850 were 1 90 4 71 and 12 24 times higher than those of fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm respectively with the strongest catalytic activity with increasing pyrolysis temperature fe rmc 850 possesses a larger specific surface and a richer pore structure providing more sites for pms adsorption and catalytic activity while the highly graphitized and defective structure might lead to nonradical pathways and facilitate electron transfer therefore fe rmc 850 was chosen as the catalyst in the subsequent study 3 3 effect of catalyst and pms dosing temperature and ph the effect of catalyst dosage on the catalytic degradation performance of smx is shown in fig 7 a the degradation rate of smx increased gradually with increasing fe rmc 850 dose and then leveled off when the dose of fe rmc 850 was increased from 0 1 to 0 2 g l the degradation rate of smx increased from 67 to 95 and kobs increased from 0 039 to 0 097 min 1 in 30 min when the dose of fe rmc 850 was increased to 0 3 g l smx was completely degraded in 25 min and its kobs reached 0 248 min 1 while when fe rmc 850 continued to be increased to 0 4 g l the corresponding kobs was 0 253 min 1 which was only 0 005 higher than the kobs value at 0 3 g l the analysis concluded that when the fe rmc 850 was 0 1 0 3 g l the larger catalyst concentration in the solution provided more active sites for pms and accelerated the rate of radical generation and with the excessive increase in dosage it might lead to insufficient pms concentration in solution or self quenching with so4 and oh eqs 1 3 making the improvement of degradation efficiency not obvious 28 considering the degradation rate and economics the dosage of fe rmc 850 was selected as 0 3 g l for subsequent experiments the effect of pms dosing on the performance of catalytic degradation of smx is shown in fig 7 b when the pms dosage was 0 1 0 25 g l the degradation rate of smx increased with increasing pms dosage and the corresponding kobs increased from 0 053 to 0 2611 min 1 this was because increasing the pms dosage could form more active substances to participate in the reaction however when the pms concentration continued to increase to 0 35 g l smx was still completely degraded within 25 min but its kobs dropped to 0 2475 min 1 probably because too much pms reacted with so4 and oh to form so5 which has a weaker redox potential eqs 4 and 5 29 decreasing the reaction rate therefore a pms dose of 0 25 g l was chosen for the subsequent experiment 1 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 oh hs o 5 3 oh oh h 2 o 2 4 hs o 5 s o 4 s o 4 2 s o 5 h 5 hs o 5 oh s o 5 h 2 o the effect of different temperatures on the catalytic degradation performance of smx is shown in fig 7 c the degradation rate of smx increased with the increase of the system temperature and when the solution temperature was 55 c smx was completely degraded in 15 min the kobs values at 25 35 45 and 55 c were 0 2559 0 3036 0 3419 and 0 4227 min 1 respectively the ease of reaction is usually judged by the reaction activation energy ea the lower the ea value is the easier the reaction will be the ea of fe rmc 850 was calculated by eq 6 as 13 7284 kj mol which was significantly lower than the activation energy values of reported pms catalysts such as graphene 43 8 kj mol and carbon nanotubes 80 4 kj mol 30 indicating that fe rmc 850 had a strong activation potential for pms 6 ln k ln a e a r 1 t the different ph of the solution not only determine the type of transition metal formation but also influence the process of radical generation by pms decomposition which in turn affects the degradation efficiency the effect of different ph on the performance of catalytic degradation of smx is shown in fig 7 d at ph 3 9 the degradation rate of smx increased with increasing ph the best degradation effect was achieved at ph 9 where smx was completely degraded in 15 min with a kobs value of 0 3462 min 1 at ph 9 10 the degradation rate of smx decreased significantly and the kobs value at ph 9 was 13 times higher than that at ph 10 analysis suggests that there were two isopotentials for pms pka1 0 pka2 9 when the ph was low pms was present as hso5 31 and high concentrations of h readily formed hydrogen bonds with the peroxide bond oo in hso5 inhibiting the interaction with fe rmc 850 and resulting in poor smx degradation rates with increasing ph the competitive advantage of h decreases and the smx degradation rate gradually increases while at ph 9 higher oh quenches so4 to produce less oxidizable oh decreasing the reaction efficiency 32 3 4 effects of inorganic anions and humic acid various soluble inorganic anions are widely present in natural waters and these anions may have a significant influence on the degradation process due to their specific properties therefore cl so 4 2 and hco 3 0 10 30 and 50 mm were chosen to investigate their effect on the catalytic performance as shown in fig 8 a the degradation process was significantly promoted by cl with kobs values increasing from 0 2573 to 0 4267 min 1 when the cl was 0 50 mm which might be because higher concentrations of cl readily react with pms to form hocl cl2 eqs 7 9 and the synergistic effect of hocl cl2 with free radicals improves the catalytic efficiency 33 as shown in fig 8 b the smx removal rate showed a decreasing trend with increasing so 4 2 concentration indicating that so 4 2 was able to trap free radicals to inhibit the degradation reaction eq 10 34 the effect of hco 3 on the removal rate of smx is shown in 8 c when hco 3 10 30 mm there was a strong inhibition of smx degradation and with increasing hco 3 concentration the inhibition decreased when hco 3 50 mm the inhibition disappeared and there was a slight promotion smx was completely reduced after 20 min and its kobs value rose to 0 3095 min 1 analysis suggested that in the presence of lower hco 3 concentrations hco 3 and its resulting co 3 2 consume the more oxidizing so4 and oh producing hco 3 and co 3 with lower redox sites thereby reducing the efficiency of the reaction eqs 11 13 with increasing hco 3 concentration the rise in solution ph promotes the decomposition of pms to produce so5 2 to enhance the removal efficiency eq 14 35 humic acid ha a natural organic substance is widely present in secondary effluent from sewage treatment plants and in surface water sources as seen from the fig 8 d there was a slight inhibition of the degradation of smx by ha with kobs values of 0 2616 0 1936 0 1576 and 0 1048 min 1 at ha concentrations of 0 5 10 and 20 mg l respectively which might be related to the highly aromatized and abundant alicyclic structure of ha being prone to form Ï Ï bonds with the catalyst to occupy adsorption sites and catalytically active sites or competition with smx for free radicals 36 37 7 hs o 5 2 c l s o 4 2 hocl 8 hs o 5 2 c l h s o 4 2 c l 2 h 2 o 9 c l 2 aq h 2 o hocl h cl 10 so 4 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 e aq 11

indicator of catalyst performance the catalyst was separated by an applied magnetic field at the end of each reaction repeatedly washed and dried and then continued to be used in catalytic degradation experiments with the results shown in fig 9 in three replicate experiments the removal rate at 20 min was 99 99 and 98 and the catalytic efficiency remained the same at four replicates smx removal rate at 20 min dropped to 92 at five replicates smx removal rate at 20 min dropped to 83 but the removal rate of 97 could be achieved within 30 min the analysis concluded that the following occurred as the number of cycles increased â  the functional groups on the surface of fe rmc 850 were destroyed â¡ the smx degradation intermediates blocked the catalyst active sites 38 resulting in a slight decrease in catalytic activity but fe rmc 850 still showed strong catalytic performance after five cycles indicating that fe rmc 850 has good potential for application 3 6 reactive oxygen species identification alcohols with Î± h atoms present such as methanol meoh usually have strong reaction rate with oh and so4 and could therefore rapidly quench both radicals in contrast tert butanol tba which has no Î± h reacts quickly with oh and have a weaker quenching effect for so4 because their reaction rate with oh is thousands of times higher than that of so4 39 as seen from the fig 10 a when meoh and tba were added to the fe rmc 850 pms system smx removal rate decreased from 100 to 82 and 73 respectively in 30 min tba had a slight but not significant inhibition advantage over meoh probably because meoh is a hydrophilic compound and cannot collect on and around the surface of the solid phase catalyst in a large area in a solid liquid two phase nonhomogeneous system at the same time fe rmc 850 could be characterized by the presence of a large number of mesoporous microporous and layered structures that could provide large reaction sites for electrons reactants resulting in the inability of meoh to quench the radicals on the surface of fe rmc 850 40 when a certain concentration of phenol was added phenol pms molar ratio 1000 1 only 53 smx was degraded in 30 min so it could be confirmed that the degradation process occurred mainly on and around the catalyst surface in order to distinguish which is the dominant role of so4 and oh in the fe rmc 850 pms system nitrobenzene nb was used as the oh scavenger and the smx removal rate was 84 within 30 min indicating that a small amount of oh was formed in the fe rmc 850 pms system indicating that the role of oh in the fe rmc 850 pms system is less while so4 was the main contributor for the possible presence of o 2 and 1o2 p benzoquinone bq and nan3 were used as quenching agents for o 2 and 1o2 respectively as seen from the graphs the degradation rates of smx in 30 min were 89 and 56 when bq and l h were present respectively indicating that o 2 and 1o2 were involved in the degradation reaction and 1o2 had a greater influence on the degradation process further verification of the so4 oh o 2 and 1o2 generation in the fe rmc 850 pms system by epr spectroscopy dmpo and temp were utilized to capture so4 and oh as well as o 2 and 1o2 respectively 41 as seen from the fig 10 b four characteristic peaks of dmpo oh with a peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were detected in the fe rmc 850 pms system and six characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 with a peak intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 1 1 were also present 42 while the presence of the o 2 characteristic signal in fig 10 c further supports the inference that o 2 was involved in the reaction process a triple peak with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 could be observed when temp was used as the trapping agent fig 10 d directly verifying the presence of 1o2 43 thus based on the above results it was clear that both radical and nonradical pathways contribute significantly to the degradation process 3 7 catalytic mechanism to further investigate the mechanism of the structural characteristics of the catalyst surface and the fe species on the degradation of smx by activated pms xps analysis was performed on fe rmc 850 before and after the reaction as seen from the fig 11 a e after the reaction the peaks at fe0 disappeared indicating the involvement of fe0 in the reaction the intensity of the peak at fe2 weakened while that corresponding to fe3 increased significantly and the location of the peak changed indicating that fe2 was partially converted to fe3 during the reaction the proportions of c oh and cooh decreased to 9 16 and 16 06 after the reaction fig 11 b indicating that both c oh and cooh were involved in the degradation process 44 as shown in fig 11 c the percentage of oi decreased from 51 85 to 14 11 while that of oii and oiii increased from 29 55 and 18 6 to 35 26 and 50 63 respectively indicating that fe rmc 850 underwent a strong hydroxylation reaction in the degradation experiment 45 in addition after the reaction fig 11 d e the pyridinic n content decreased from 31 81 to 15 17 indicating that pyridinic n was depleted as the main active n while pc cpo3 c2po2 decreased from 39 93 and 23 26 to 23 5 and 4 49 respectively indicating that both pc and cpo3 c2po2 could be used as new active sites for pms activation therefore based on the results of quenching experiments and xps analysis two possible pathways for the degradation of smx by fe rmc 850 activated pms were proposed namely the radical pathway and the nonradical pathway â  radical pathway fe0 functional aspects fe0 could act as a good redox mediator to provide electrons to pms to generate so4 and oh eqs 15 18 while fe0 could accelerate the rate of fe3 fe2 conversion and further enhancing the electron giving ability to activate pms to produce more so4 and oh eq 19 fe2 bc was hydroxylated in the aqueous phase to generate fe2 oh which forms the complex fe2 ho oso3 through ligand substitution and finally decomposes to produce so4 eqs 20 21 46 according to the bq quenching tests the production of o 2 was attributed to the reaction of so5 2 with h2o eqs 22 23 carbon structure aspects pyridinic n could promote Ï electron transfer in the sp2 hybridized carbon structure activating pms and generating so4 and oh â¡ nonradical pathway fe0 functional aspects the introduction of fe induces positively charged neighboring carbon atoms and promotes the production of 1o2 47 and the production of o 2 also facilitates the further production of 1o2 eqs 26 28 carbon structure aspects c oh and cooh on the surface of biochar were converted to c o and coo and activated pms to produce 1o2 by releasing free radicals eqs 24 25 on the other hand fe rmc 850 inherent p atom doping forms pc and pc cpo3 c2po2 generates more defective sites to further generate 1o2 and strengthen the nonradical pathway the strong oxidation of so4 oh o 2 and 1o2 produced by the above process oxidizes smx to a series of intermediate products up to mineralization to co2 and h2o eq 29 15 fe 0 2 hs o 5 fe 2 2 s o 4 2 o h 16 fe 2 hs o 5 fe 3 s o 4 2 o h 17 fe 0 o 2 2 h fe 2 h 2 o 2 18 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 o h oh 19 fe 0 2 fe 3 3 fe 2 20 fe 2 o h hs o

non radical pathway that was formed by the transfer of electrons from the organic pollutants to the pms through a conducting medium this result was further confirmed by eis and lsv 48 regarding eis results fig 12 a usually the smaller the radius of the arc of the material is the lower the impedance thus making the charge transfer easier the radius of the arc of the samples decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature rfe rmc 850 rfe rmc 750 rfe rmc 650 indicating that fe rmc 850 generated at high temperature had higher electrical conductivity and charge transfer capability these improvements may be related to the generation of a mesoporous graphitized structure 36 regarding the lsv results fig 12 b the current of the fe rmc 850 pms system was significantly higher than that of only fe rmc 850 indicating that electron transfer occurred between the graphitized structure on fe rmc 850 and pms the current intensity of the fe rmc 850 pms smx system was further enhanced indicating that the current of this fe rmc 850 system was due to electron transfer between pms and smx 49 4 conclusions for the first time fe3o4 rabbit manure was used as a precursor and converted into a high performance pms activation material through an effective pathway and used to treat refractory organic matter in wastewater nzvi biochar composite materials were prepared by carbonizing fe3o4 rabbit manure at different temperatures the results showed that fe rmc 850 possessed a larger specific surface area total pore volume and graphitization degree than fe rmc 750 fe rmc 650 and fe3o4 rm as the pyrolysis temperature increased smx 10 mg l was completely degraded in 20 min when pms 0 25 g l fe rmc 850 0 3 g l and t 25 c and the system still had good catalytic activity after 5 cycles the results of quenching experiments epr and xps analysis indicated that radical and nonradical pathways act synergistically in the degradation of smx with nzvi fe2 bc pyridinic n c oh and cooh

reducing the total bacterial count in wastewater by high voltage spark discharges using a developed experimental setup has been investigated the total bacterial count was measured by the rapid method using a luminometric mini laboratory ensure touch and a standard method for counting bacteria capable of forming colony forming units on nutrient agar wastewater from the zhulebinsky storm collector with an initial concentration of 1012 cfu ml 1 with a volume of 103 ml is disinfected up to the norm 6 log in 120 s with capacitance 0 1 Î¼f and in 180 s with capacitance 0 05 Î¼f wastewater from the kuryanovsky storm channel with an initial concentration of 109 cfu ml 1 with a volume of 103 ml is disinfected up to the norm 6 log in 100 s with capacitance 0 1 Î¼f and in 160 s with capacitance 0 05 Î¼f to reduce the concentration of total bacterial count by 1 log the minimum duration of disinfection of 103 ml of wastewater it took about 30 s at a discharge energy of 5 j ml 1 the advantages of bacterial inactivation in wastewater by high voltage spark discharges were revealed such as low operating voltage of 10 kv high energy efficiency of 600 j l 1 and capacity 30 l h 1 increased service life and operational reliability portability and environmental friendliness keywords electrohydraulic effect water engineering electric discharges disinfection colony forming units 1 introduction according to world health organization almost a fifth of the world s population experiences poor quality or lack of fresh water 1 about 60 of the total land area falls on zones with a shortage of fresh water fresh water supplies are exhaustible natural resources therefore they require economical consumption and careful storage fresh water plays an important role in human life and is widely used in everyday life industry and agriculture large volumes of wastewater are a by product of human household and industrial activities and the result of atmospheric precipitation industrial wastewater contains impurities of various heavy metals and is reused after appropriate treatment in the technological process according to modern environmental standards regarding wastewater discharge the enterprises create circulating and closed drainage systems or introduce promising drainless technologies for waste free processing of various raw materials 2 surface wastewater or storm runoffs can be rain and melt depending on the climatic characteristics of the country the nature of the formation of atmospheric precipitation determines the presence of many different compounds containing nitrogen calcium potassium phosphorus and other elements in storm runoffs wastewater can serve as a source of nutrients for crop production when irrigating agricultural land taking into account the limited global water supply in the world surface wastewater can be chosen as a rational alternative to fresh irrigation water however the bacterial contamination of storm runoffs does not allow using them without preliminary disinfection 3 chlorination is a cheap and affordable method of water disinfection however chlorine is toxic and dangerous to plant development 4 ultraviolet water treatment is considered as an effective disinfection method the disadvantages of ultraviolet exposure are high operating costs including electricity and equipment maintenance 5 ozone is capable of inactivating of most known bacteria and viruses however ozonation of water does not allow the stable destruction of organic microorganisms often brings a temporary effect 6 a combination of various methods is used to eliminate the disadvantages and increase the efficiency of wastewater treatment 7 solar wastewater treatment allows to reduce water turbidity inactivate fecal streptococci 8 the disadvantage is dependence on solar activity and climatic characteristics the electrohydraulic effect is a consequence of the generation of high voltage spark pulse discharges between high voltage electrodes placed in water 9 10 electric field ultraviolet radiation shock waves sound vibrations free radicals and ions are generated in the discharge zone 11 13 these factors may allow the use of electrohydraulic discharges for water purification 14 plasma of discharges in water ensures inactivation of various bacteria such as escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis 15 17 due to its disinfecting property spark discharges can be used in systems for purifying drinking or sea water 18 due to the shock action the electrohydraulic effect can be used in medicine for the treatment of tumor diseases and in agriculture to restore the ecosystem of lakes by processing cyanobacteria 19 20 disinfection of wastewater by high voltage spark discharges for use in irrigation of agricultural crops is a new promising relevant and environmentally friendly technology however the widespread use of the electrohydraulic method of wastewater disinfection is constrained by safety requirements that must be observed when working with high voltage setup the working range of electrical voltages reaches several tens of kilovolts 21 22 the working electrodes of the setup operating at such voltage ratings must have reliable insulation of sufficient thickness and strength from the body instrumentation and other equipment components in addition the existing technical means for water disinfection with high voltage discharges are unreasonably expensive bulky and not transportable the setup used at the moment contain powerful transformers that allow to increase the voltage up to 100 kv 23 24 to accumulate such an operating voltage powerful capacitors with a capacitance of up to 2 Î¼f are required the discharge gap should be formed from conducting balls of large volume and mass this requires wires and switching equipment of the appropriate size and power the operating voltage of spark discharges of 10 kv may be sufficient to achieve significant indicators for water disinfection increasing the voltage reduces the operational reliability of the electrodes the objective of the present study was to investigate the possibility of reducing the total bacterial count in wastewater by high voltage spark discharges using the developed experimental setup the purified water is proposed to be used for irrigation in agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the development of the setup is based on the principle of the electrohydraulic effect the main distinguishing features of the experimental setup for the disinfection of wastewater in comparison with the known and previously investigated prototype samples are the design parameters and the operating mode 25 26 the technical novelty of the setup is as follows operating voltage 10 kv the applied voltage to the primary winding of the high voltage transformer is not more than 10 v in contrast to the prototype which uses 220 v instead of the high voltage transformer tvi 50 70 with a power of 5 kw a line high voltage transformer tdks32 04 with a power of 0 5 kw is used instead of a titanium operating device a plastic operating device made using 3d printing technology from abs material to eliminate high voltage electrical breakdowns on the setup body is used the high voltage capacitor 100 kv was replaced by a high voltage capacitor k75 29a designed for a voltage not exceeding 16 kv capacitance not exceeding 0 1 Î¼f the wastewater disinfection setup consists of a pulse voltage generator a spark gap an operating device and instrumentation fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental setup for determining the relationships and functionality of individual components the pulse voltage generator is designed to generate voltage that is sufficient for the breakdown of the forming and working gaps between the electrodes thus some of the energy is released in the spark gap channel in accordance with the schematic diagram the pulse voltage generator consists of a power supply a pulse high voltage step up transformer with rectifier and a capacitive storage device with lumped parameters capacitor the voltage source is the computer s power supply the choice of which is due to the sufficient power of the current switching transistors included in the circuit the make and model of the power supply unit is of no practical importance since 10 v required for supply to the transformer provide a sufficient number of power supplies for example fa 5 1 300 w power supply preliminary experiments have shown that circuits assembled based on less powerful transistors due to their overheating are not suitable for operation under specified conditions that is when generating pulsed high voltage discharges the computer s power supply converts the 220 v power supply into 10 v sinusoidal voltage which is generated on the step down transformer of the power supply to the secondary winding of which the primary winding of the step up transformer tdks32 04 is connected the primary winding contains 16 turns the number of turns is selected experimentally pulse high voltage step up transformer tdks32 04 is designed to multiply energy and to increase the maximum value of the square wave voltage pulse the transformer contains a high voltage rectifier assembled in a full wave circuit the high voltage lead of the tdks32 04 is connected through a 1 kÏ limiting resistor to one capacitor lead the low voltage lead is connected to the other lead of the capacitor installation of electrical wiring for the main high voltage units of the setup is carried out by means of a high voltage wire pmvklng a 20 kv on the basis of the schematic diagram the experimental setup for the disinfection of wastewater and operating device shown in fig 2 was made the leads of the k75 29a capacitor are connected to the forming gap made on metal balls with a diameter of 18 mm the balls function as a high voltage energy arrester the forming discharge gap is necessary to ensure the intensity of the electrohydraulic effect high power of a single pulse shorten the duration of the discharge and eliminate gas and vapor formation in the spark discharge zone the metal balls are bolted onto mounting plates steel grade st45 was chosen as the material of the ball arresters the forming spark gap is connected to the pins of the high voltage and low voltage electrodes of the operating device the low voltage electrode is made up of a 10 mm diameter pin and a 1520 mm disc tip the disc tip is threaded onto the stud the high voltage electrode is made in the form of a hairpin with a diameter of 5 mm in the form of a sharp point or pointed rod thus a working gap is formed formed by the disc point electrode system 27 corrosion resistant steel of grade 08x17h13m2t was selected as the electrode material the choice of the steel grade of the electrodes is due to the working conditions of the operating device such as exposure to water and high temperature copper and aluminum electrodes showed low operational reliability due to the high degree of electrical erosion of the electrode material into the treated water under the influence of spark discharges in addition significant potholes depressions and cavities in the area of electrical discharges are formed on the surface of copper and aluminum electrodes due to the operation of electrohydraulic shocks this phenomenon affects the basic characteristics of the electrohydraulic machining process reducing the efficiency the use of harder materials reduces this dependence the electrodes are screwed into the walls of the outlets of the operating device the operating device performs the functions of a cavitation tank which treated water is collected and spark discharges are formed in the threaded connections are sealed to ensure tightness by winding teflon tape for safety reasons the high voltage units of the setup are placed on a 10 mm thick fr 2 paxolin plate the used measuring equipment includes eone et201 ammeter connected to the input terminal of the tdks32 04 transformer control of the electric current in the circuit is necessary only at the preliminary stage of preparation for the study to analyze the magnitude and duration of the pulse discharge current during the study the ammeter should be disconnected from the electrical circuit since its presence lowers the high voltage across the arrester by 1 2 kv this phenomenon was revealed experimentally the error of current measurements in the circuit was 0 5 the precision was 1 and the range of operation was up to 10 a tds 5104b oscilloscope was used to study the current and voltage signals in the arrester of the setup the current in the discharge gap was recorded with tektronix p6022 current probe the error of current measurements in the discharge gap was 1 the precision was 2 and the range of operation was not higher 1 ka the voltage at the terminals of the spark gap was measured with skv100 digital kilovoltmeter the measuring range of the skv100 kilovoltmeter is 30 kv which meets the operating conditions of the developed setup the error of voltage measurements was 0 25 and the precision was 0 5 the conditions for the optimal operation of the setup are the maximum steepness of the leading edge of the spark pulse the transfer of energy from the storage device to the forming and working gaps with minimal losses reliability of operation and durability of components and assemblies the optimum operating mode of the setup for wastewater disinfection has the following characteristics setup dimensions 0 22 0 31 0 42 m setup weight 10 kg power supply 0 3 kw transformer power 0 5 kw operating voltage 10 kv capacitor 0 01 0 1 Î¼f forming and working gaps 1 mm system of electrodes disc point frequency of spark electric discharges 1 hz number of discharges 60 300 energy 0 5 5 j per discharge table 1 describes the meaning of the materials and equipment used 2 2 methods during the experiments the object of study was the urban surface wastewater of the zhulebinsky storm collector and the kuryanovsky storm channel formed as a result of atmospheric precipitation wastewater samples were taken after pretreatment on treatment facilities for reliability and accuracy of studies the concentration of total bacterial count was measured by two methods at first the bacterial contamination of wastewater was determined by a fast modern express method using a portable luminometric mini laboratory ensure touch and atp liquid test aquasnap total the error of total bacterial count measurements using the express method was 5 the precision was 7 then to confirm the results of express tests colony forming units were counted using a standard method the method determines the total count of mesophilic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria in wastewater capable of forming colonies on nutrient agar at 37 c within 24 h visible with a twofold increase in each sample at least two volumes of 1 ml were inoculated after thorough mixing the wastewater samples were added to sterile petri plates 1 ml each slightly opening the lids after adding wastewater 8 12 ml of melted nutrient agar and cooled to 45 49 c was poured into each plate then the contents of the plates were quickly mixed spreading evenly over the entire bottom avoiding the formation of air bubbles agar getting on the edges and the lid of the plate this procedure was carried out on a horizontal surface where the plates were left until the agar solidified for the period of analysis melted agar was placed in a water bath or thermostat maintained at 45 49 c after solidification of agar the inoculation plates were placed in a thermostat upside down and incubated at 37 c for 24 h all colonies grown on the plate observed at twofold magnification were counted only those plates which not more than 300 isolated colonies grew on were taken into account the number of colonies on both plates was summed up and divided by two the result is expressed by the number of colony forming units cfu in 1 ml of the test water sample it takes more time to measure with the standard method but it is more accurate than the express method the error of total bacterial count measurements using the standard method was 2 the precision was 3 the measurement range of total bacterial count was from 103 to 1012 cfu ml 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of the concentration of total bacterial count in wastewater in the sample of wastewater from the zhulebinsky storm collector the initial concentration of total bacterial count was 1012 cfu ml 1 in the sample of the kuryanovsky storm channel 109 cfu ml 1 these values were obtained by averaging three repeated measurements the one time loading volume of wastewater into the experimental unit was 103 ml to achieve the result of electrohydraulic disinfection the operating voltage the number of discharges and the capacitance of the capacitor have the greatest influence it should be noted that these interdependencies were revealed when working with a more powerful and dimensional setup 9 therefore when carrying out experiments with the above experimental setup it is necessary to take into account its design features it is not possible to vary the operating voltage value since the fa 5 1 300 w power supply generates an unregulated primary voltage of 10 v tdks32 04 transformer provides only a voltage increase up to 10 kv but does not provide the possibility of its regulation during operation the introduction of additional devices for adjusting the operating voltage seems impractical due to the rise in the cost of the setup in addition increase in voltage leads to decrease of the service life of the insulators and electrodes according to fig 3 studies of the effect of different voltages on the concentration of total bacterial count in wastewater were carried out at the maximum capacitance of the capacitor and the number of discharges using transformer tvi 50 70 fig 4 shows the concentration of total bacterial count versus currents in the discharge gap corresponding to voltages from 2 to 10 kv the graphs show that a voltage of 10 kv can be sufficient for electrohydraulic water disinfection at a lower voltage the concentration of total bacterial count in the wastewater of the zhulebinsky storm collector and the kuryanovsky storm channel does not decrease below 106 107 cfu ml 1 experimental curves are approximated by theoretical curves the approximation equations and their veracity r2 are shown the capacitance of the capacitor is experimentally selected according to the condition for accumulating the maximum discharge energy in the working and forming gaps the influence of the inductance factor of the oscillating circuit on the rigidity and power of the discharges should be noted the cross section and length of buses and wires should be as small as possible to ensure the formation of the maximum possible steepness of spark impulse discharges an inductance of 1 Î¼h is selected experimentally wastewater was treated with high voltage spark discharges 60 120 180 240 300 fig 5 shows the change in the concentration of total bacterial count in the wastewater of the zhulebinsky storm collector depending on the number of discharges at different capacitance of the capacitor fig 6 shows the change in the concentration of total bacterial count in the wastewater of the kuryanovsky storm channel depending on the number of discharges at different capacitance of the capacitor experimental curves are approximated by exponential theoretical curves which are described to mathematical equations with approximation veracity r2 since the frequency of spark electric discharges is 1 hz the number of discharges corresponds to the duration of disinfection the concentration of total bacterial count in irrigation water should not exceed 106 cfu ml 1 28 wastewater from the zhulebinsky storm collector with an initial concentration of 1012 cfu ml 1 with a volume of 103 ml is disinfected to normal in 120 s with capacitance 0 1 Î¼f and in 180 s with capacitance 0 05 Î¼f wastewater from the kuryanovsky storm channel with an initial concentration of 109 cfu ml 1 with a volume of 103 ml is disinfected to normal in 100 s with capacitance 0 1 Î¼f and in 160 s with capacitance 0 05 Î¼f at a lower capacitance it was not possible to reduce the concentration of total bacterial count below 107 cfu ml 1 the statistical error was not higher 1 and was minimized due to the threefold repeatability of measurements fig 7 shows the dependence of the concentration of total bacterial count in the wastewater of the zhulebinsky storm collector and the kuryanovsky storm channel on the specific energy at the discharge energy 5 j the approximation theoretical curves their equations and veracity r2 are shown the change in the capacitance of the capacitor at a constant operating voltage of 10 kv corresponded to the change in the energy of each of the spark discharges 0 01 Î¼f 0 5 j 0 02 Î¼f 1 j 0 05 Î¼f 2 5 j 0 1 Î¼f 5 j to reduce the concentration of total bacterial count by 1 log the minimum duration of disinfection of 103 ml of wastewater was about 30 s at a discharge energy of 5 j ml 1 which is less than that of analogues 29 specific energy for ozonation of wastewater is about 700 j l 1 1 for the disinfection of wastewater by high voltage spark discharges the optimal specific energy of 600 j l 1 was experimentally obtained the capacity of equipment for ultraviolet wastewater disinfection is about 25 l h 1 30 the optimal capacity of the developed experimental setup was determined as 30 l h 1 the optimization criterion was the minimum duration the capacity of the setup can be increased due to additional pairs of electrodes and scaling of the operating device the proposed electrohydraulic method of wastewater disinfection has a higher energy efficiency compared to ozonation and a higher capacity compared to ultraviolet radiation electric and magnetic fields ultraviolet radiation shock waves sound vibrations free radicals and ions are the main factors in reduction of the total bacterial count in wastewater it results from the substantiation of the physical phenomena occurring during high voltage spark discharges in a liquid during spark discharges in the forming and working gaps a pulsed current of complex shape flows consisting of one or several bursts of about 103 104 a and a duration of 10 6 s the flow of impulse currents is based on two physical phenomena the release of energy in the form of heat in the conductors when the current flows through them and the creation of a magnetic field in the space surrounding the conductor and in the conductor itself in pulse modes huge rates of energy release and energy density are realized which are unattainable in stationary modes the flow of a pulsed current in a medium with a certain electrical conductivity causes heating of the medium often close to adiabatic when heated the mechanical properties of the medium its thermophysical parameters change and phase transitions occur thus a solid conductor can collapse melt and evaporate in the pulsed mode this process is accompanied by the appearance of powerful light radiation a shock wave and an electric arc the set of phenomena accompanying the flow of a high density pulsed current through a conductor can be considered as an electrical explosion of the conductor the flow of current is accompanied by a pulsed arc burning between the metal electrodes in places of contact between the metal and the arc erosion is observed evaporation melting and splashing of the metal erosion processes are determined by the rate of energy input into the electrode the cause of erosion is the surface heat source coming from the near electrode zone of the arc since the near electrode voltage drop is weakly dependent on current the energy entering the electrode is proportional to the charge carried by the current thus the degree of erosion depends on the amount of charge electrodynamic forces at high currents cause displacement deformation and destruction of current carrying conductors in pulse modes high current densities are achieved the values of electrodynamic forces can exceed the ultimate strength of the conductor material and the conductor is deformed and destroyed any pulse current generator is an energy storage device only comparatively small impulse currents can be obtained directly from the circuit without causing dangerous modes for the circuit close to short circuits in the storage device for a time exceeding the duration of the current pulse energy is accumulated in one form or another with a relatively small power consumed from the power source when the storage device is discharged high powers are developed within a short time which are necessary to generate a pulse current and pass it through the load in a capacitive storage energy is stored in the form of electrostatic energy in capacitors the accumulation process occurs when capacitors are charged from a low power high voltage rectifier and the discharge is caused by connecting the load through switching spark gaps most of the capacitive storage can be reduced to the simplest scheme of the discharge circuit consisting of capacitance inductance and active resistance charged to voltage in series the inductance includes the internal inductance of the drive the load inductance and the interconnecting busbars the stability of the characteristics of the spark gap during repeated operation is primarily determined by the material and shape of the electrodes but the working environment also plays a significant role in this matter in the developed experimental setup the working medium is wastewater the requirements for low electrical erosion preservation of an even surface relief after discharges are imposed on the materials of the spark gap electrodes this is necessary to maintain a stable static breakdown voltage of the arrester meeting these requirements leads to the use of arresters with a distributed discharge zone over small surface of the electrodes at high currents and times the discharge is contracted and the electrodes are exposed to intense heat at the reference points of the discharge channel in this case the correct choice of electrode material is important for long discharge times preference is given to materials containing highly volatile components despite the increased wear of such materials intensive evaporation leads to a smoother electrode surface in water spark gaps there is a wide range of breakdown voltages it is a consequence of the influence of environmental pollution by erosion products and uneven electrodes almost all of the molten metal is removed from the electrodes by powerful hydrodynamic flows arising from a pulsed spark discharge in water 3 2 time characteristics of high voltage spark discharges in wastewater the time characteristics of high voltage spark discharges in wastewater were investigated using equipment which consists of tds 5104b oscilloscope tektronix p6022 current probe skv100 kilovoltmeter and eone et201 ammeter fig 8 shows the dependences of changes in current and voltage on time in the discharge gap of the experimental setup for the disinfection of wastewater at the energy of each of the discharges 5 j ml 1 at the pre discharge stage the breakdown of the balls of the forming spark gap leads to a sharp increase in voltage across the working spark gap the voltage rises instantly the initial steeply rising section of the voltage curve from zero to a maximum value of 10 kv after avalanche ionization occurs streamers begin to grow in the wastewater from the volume of liquid to the high voltage electrode energy is consumed for the growth of streamers therefore a small voltage drop of 2 10 is observed in this section of the curve the growth of streamers is accompanied by the appearance of current in the streamer channel which is recorded by an oscillogram in the form of a hollow rising part of the current curve up to 102 a the pressures during the pre discharge stage are small liquid movement are also small practically absent there are no shock waves sound vibrations and ultraviolet radiation are very weak the growing strong electric field the magnetic field is small as soon as one of the streamers reaches the second electrode the pre discharge stage ends at the stage of the leading edge all the energy accumulated in the capacitor rushes into the streamer channel the current rapidly increases reaching a maximum value of 103 a high voltage spark discharges are generated this leads to an increase in the channel diameter and closure of the working gap at the same time a sharp drop in voltage is observed channel pressures rise sharply and reach maximum values the channel temperature rises to 103 104 c 31 the movements of the liquid are just starting but near the discharge zone they are maximal in acceleration shock waves are practically absent sound vibrations increase reaching a

according to world health organization almost a fifth of the world s population experiences poor quality or lack of fresh water 1 about 60 of the total land area falls on zones with a shortage of fresh water fresh water supplies are exhaustible natural resources therefore they require economical consumption and careful storage fresh water plays an important role in human life and is widely used in everyday life industry and agriculture large volumes of wastewater are a by product of human household and industrial activities and the result of atmospheric precipitation industrial wastewater contains impurities of various heavy metals and is reused after appropriate treatment in the technological process according to modern environmental standards regarding wastewater discharge the enterprises create circulating and closed drainage systems or introduce promising drainless technologies for waste free processing of various raw materials 2 surface wastewater or storm runoffs can be rain and melt depending on the climatic characteristics of the country the nature of the formation of atmospheric precipitation determines the presence of many different compounds containing nitrogen calcium potassium phosphorus and other elements in storm runoffs wastewater can serve as a source of nutrients for crop production when irrigating agricultural land taking into account the limited global water supply in the world surface wastewater can be chosen as a rational alternative to fresh irrigation water however the bacterial contamination of storm runoffs does not allow using them without preliminary disinfection 3 chlorination is a cheap and affordable method of water disinfection however chlorine is toxic and dangerous to plant development 4 ultraviolet water treatment is considered as an effective disinfection method the disadvantages of ultraviolet exposure are high operating costs including electricity and equipment maintenance 5 ozone is capable of inactivating of most known bacteria and viruses however ozonation of water does not allow the stable destruction of organic microorganisms often brings a temporary effect 6 a combination of various methods is used to eliminate the disadvantages and increase the efficiency of wastewater treatment 7 solar wastewater treatment allows to reduce water turbidity inactivate fecal streptococci 8 the disadvantage is dependence on solar activity and climatic characteristics the electrohydraulic effect is a consequence of the generation of high voltage spark pulse discharges between high voltage electrodes placed in water 9 10 electric field ultraviolet radiation shock waves sound vibrations free radicals and ions are generated in the discharge zone 11 13 these factors may allow the use of electrohydraulic discharges for water purification 14 plasma of discharges in water ensures inactivation of various bacteria such as escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis 15 17 due to its disinfecting property spark discharges can be used in systems for purifying drinking or sea water 18 due to the shock action the electrohydraulic effect can be used in medicine for the treatment of tumor diseases and in agriculture to restore the ecosystem of lakes by processing cyanobacteria 19 20 disinfection of wastewater by high voltage spark discharges for use in irrigation of agricultural crops is a new promising relevant and environmentally friendly technology however the widespread use of the electrohydraulic method of wastewater disinfection is constrained by safety requirements that must be observed when working with high voltage setup the working range of electrical voltages reaches several tens of kilovolts 21 22 the working electrodes of the setup operating at such voltage ratings must have reliable insulation of sufficient thickness and strength from the body instrumentation and other equipment components in addition the existing technical means for water disinfection with high voltage discharges are unreasonably expensive bulky and not transportable the setup used at the moment contain powerful transformers that allow to increase the voltage up to 100 kv 23 24 to accumulate such an operating voltage powerful capacitors with a capacitance of up to 2 Î¼f are required the discharge gap should be formed from conducting balls of large volume and mass this requires wires and switching equipment of the appropriate size and power the operating voltage of spark discharges of 10 kv may be sufficient to achieve significant indicators for water disinfection increasing the voltage reduces the operational reliability of the electrodes the objective of the present study was to investigate the possibility of reducing the total bacterial count in wastewater by high voltage spark discharges using the developed experimental setup the purified water is proposed to be used for irrigation in agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the development of the setup is based on the principle of the electrohydraulic effect the main distinguishing features of the experimental setup for the disinfection of wastewater in comparison with the known and previously investigated prototype samples are the design parameters and the operating mode 25 26 the technical novelty of the setup is as follows operating voltage 10 kv the applied voltage to the primary winding of the high voltage transformer is not more than 10 v in contrast to the prototype which uses 220 v instead of the high voltage transformer tvi 50 70 with a power of 5 kw a line high voltage transformer tdks32 04 with a power of 0 5 kw is used instead of a titanium operating device a plastic operating device made using 3d printing technology from abs material to eliminate high voltage electrical breakdowns on the setup body is used the high voltage capacitor 100 kv was replaced by a high voltage capacitor k75 29a designed for a voltage not exceeding 16 kv capacitance not exceeding 0 1 Î¼f the wastewater disinfection setup consists of a pulse voltage generator a spark gap an operating device and instrumentation fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental setup for determining the relationships and functionality of individual components the pulse voltage generator is designed to generate voltage that is sufficient for the breakdown of the forming and working gaps between the electrodes thus some of the energy is released in the spark gap channel in accordance with the schematic diagram the pulse voltage generator consists of a power supply a pulse high voltage step up transformer with rectifier and a capacitive storage device with lumped parameters capacitor the voltage source is the computer s power supply the choice of which is due to the sufficient power of the current switching transistors included in the circuit the make and model of the power supply unit is of no practical importance since 10 v required for supply to the transformer provide a sufficient number of power supplies for example fa 5 1 300 w power supply preliminary experiments have shown that circuits assembled based on less powerful transistors due to their overheating are not suitable for operation under specified conditions that is when generating pulsed high voltage discharges the computer s power supply converts the 220 v power supply into 10 v sinusoidal voltage which is generated on the step down transformer of the power supply to the secondary winding of which the primary winding of the step up transformer tdks32 04 is connected the primary winding contains 16 turns the number of turns is selected experimentally pulse high voltage step up transformer tdks32 04 is designed to multiply energy and to increase the maximum value of the square wave voltage pulse the transformer contains a high voltage rectifier assembled in a full wave circuit the high voltage lead of the tdks32 04 is connected through a 1 kÏ limiting resistor to one capacitor lead the low voltage lead is connected to the other lead of the capacitor installation of electrical wiring for the main high voltage units of the setup is carried out by means of a high voltage wire pmvklng a 20 kv on the basis of the schematic diagram the experimental setup for the disinfection of wastewater and operating device shown in fig 2 was made the leads of the k75 29a capacitor are connected to the forming gap made on metal balls with a diameter of 18 mm the balls function as a high voltage energy arrester the forming discharge gap is necessary to ensure the intensity of the electrohydraulic effect high power of a single pulse shorten the duration of the discharge and eliminate gas and vapor formation in the spark discharge zone the metal balls are bolted onto mounting plates steel grade st45 was chosen as the material of the ball arresters the forming spark gap is connected to the pins of the high voltage and low voltage electrodes of the operating device the low voltage electrode is made up of a 10 mm diameter pin and a 1520 mm disc tip the disc tip is threaded onto the stud the high voltage electrode is made in the form of a hairpin with a diameter of 5 mm in the form of a sharp point or pointed rod thus a working gap is formed formed by the disc point electrode system 27 corrosion resistant steel of grade 08x17h13m2t was selected as the electrode material the choice of the steel grade of the electrodes is due to the working conditions of the operating device such as exposure to water and high temperature copper and aluminum electrodes showed low operational reliability due to the high degree of electrical erosion of the electrode material into the treated water under the influence of spark discharges in addition significant potholes depressions and cavities in the area of electrical discharges are formed on the surface of copper and aluminum electrodes due to the operation of electrohydraulic shocks this phenomenon affects the basic characteristics of the electrohydraulic machining process reducing the efficiency the use of harder materials reduces this dependence the electrodes are screwed into the walls of the outlets of the operating device the operating device performs the functions of a cavitation tank which treated water is collected and spark discharges are formed in the threaded connections are sealed to ensure tightness by winding teflon tape for safety reasons the high voltage units of the setup are placed on a 10 mm thick fr 2 paxolin plate the used measuring equipment includes eone et201 ammeter connected to the input terminal of the tdks32 04 transformer control of the electric current in the circuit is necessary only at the preliminary stage of preparation for the study to analyze the magnitude and duration of the pulse discharge current during the study the ammeter should be disconnected from the electrical circuit since its presence lowers the high voltage across the arrester by 1 2 kv this phenomenon was revealed experimentally the error of current measurements in the circuit was 0 5 the precision was 1 and the range of operation was up to 10 a tds 5104b oscilloscope was used to study the current and voltage signals in the arrester of the setup the current in the discharge gap was recorded with tektronix p6022 current probe the error of current measurements in the discharge gap was 1 the precision was 2 and the range of operation was not higher 1 ka the voltage at the terminals of the spark gap was measured with skv100 digital kilovoltmeter the measuring range of the skv100 kilovoltmeter is 30 kv which meets the operating conditions of the developed setup the error of voltage measurements was 0 25 and the precision was 0 5 the conditions for the optimal operation of the setup are the maximum steepness of the leading edge of the spark pulse the transfer of energy from the storage device to the forming and working gaps with minimal losses reliability of operation and durability of components and assemblies the optimum operating mode of the setup for wastewater disinfection has the following characteristics setup dimensions 0 22 0 31 0 42 m setup weight 10 kg power supply 0 3 kw transformer power 0 5 kw operating voltage 10 kv capacitor 0 01 0 1 Î¼f forming and working gaps 1 mm system of electrodes disc point frequency of spark electric discharges 1 hz number of discharges 60 300 energy 0 5 5 j per discharge table 1 describes the meaning of the materials and equipment used 2 2 methods during the experiments the object of study was the urban surface wastewater of the zhulebinsky storm collector and the kuryanovsky storm channel formed as a result of atmospheric precipitation wastewater samples were taken after pretreatment on treatment facilities for reliability and accuracy of studies the concentration of total bacterial count was measured by two methods at first the bacterial contamination of wastewater was determined by a fast modern express method using a portable luminometric mini laboratory ensure touch and atp liquid test aquasnap total the error of total bacterial count measurements using the express method was 5 the precision was 7 then to confirm the results of express tests colony forming units were counted using a standard method the method determines the total count of mesophilic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria in wastewater capable of forming colonies on nutrient agar at 37 c within 24 h visible with a twofold increase in each sample at least two volumes of 1 ml were inoculated after thorough mixing the wastewater samples were added to sterile petri plates 1 ml each slightly opening the lids after adding wastewater 8 12 ml of melted nutrient agar and cooled to 45 49 c was poured into each plate then the contents of the plates were quickly mixed spreading evenly over the entire bottom avoiding the formation of air bubbles agar getting on the edges and the lid of the plate this procedure was carried out on a horizontal surface where the plates were left until the agar solidified for the period of analysis melted agar was placed in a water bath or thermostat maintained at 45 49 c after solidification of agar the inoculation plates were placed in a thermostat upside down and incubated at 37 c for 24 h all colonies grown on the plate observed at twofold magnification were counted only those plates which not more than 300 isolated colonies grew on were taken into account the number of colonies on both plates was summed up and divided by two the result is expressed by the number of colony forming units cfu in 1 ml of the test water sample it takes more time to measure with the standard method but it is more accurate than the express method the error of total bacterial count measurements using the standard method was 2 the precision was 3 the measurement range of total bacterial count was from 103 to 1012 cfu ml 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of the concentration of total bacterial count in wastewater in the sample of wastewater from the zhulebinsky storm collector the initial concentration of total bacterial count was 1012 cfu ml 1 in the sample of the kuryanovsky storm channel 109 cfu ml 1 these values were obtained by averaging three repeated measurements the one time loading volume of wastewater into the experimental unit was 103 ml to achieve the result of electrohydraulic disinfection the operating voltage the number of discharges and the capacitance of the capacitor have the greatest influence it should be noted that these interdependencies were revealed when working with a more powerful and dimensional setup 9 therefore when carrying out experiments with the above experimental setup it is necessary to take into account its design features it is not possible to vary the operating voltage value since the fa 5 1 300 w power supply generates an unregulated primary voltage of 10 v tdks32 04 transformer provides only a voltage increase up to 10 kv but does not provide the possibility of its regulation during operation the introduction of additional devices for adjusting the operating voltage seems impractical due to the rise in the cost of the setup in addition increase in voltage leads to decrease of the service life of the insulators and electrodes according to fig 3 studies of the effect of different voltages on the concentration of total bacterial count in wastewater were carried out at the maximum capacitance of the capacitor and the number of discharges using transformer tvi 50 70 fig 4 shows the concentration of total bacterial count versus currents in the discharge gap corresponding to voltages from 2 to 10 kv the graphs show that a voltage of 10 kv can be sufficient for electrohydraulic water disinfection at a lower voltage the concentration of total bacterial count in the wastewater of the zhulebinsky storm collector and the kuryanovsky storm channel does not decrease below 106 107 cfu ml 1 experimental curves are approximated by theoretical curves the approximation equations and their veracity r2 are shown the capacitance of the capacitor is experimentally selected according to the condition for accumulating the maximum discharge energy in the working and forming gaps the influence of the inductance factor of the oscillating circuit on the rigidity and power of the discharges should be noted the cross section and length of buses and wires should be as small as possible to ensure the formation of the maximum possible steepness of spark impulse discharges an inductance of 1 Î¼h is selected experimentally wastewater was treated with high voltage spark discharges 60 120 180 240 300 fig 5 shows the change in the concentration of total bacterial count in the wastewater of the zhulebinsky storm collector depending on the number of discharges at different capacitance of the capacitor fig 6 shows the change in the concentration of total bacterial count in the wastewater of the kuryanovsky storm channel depending on the number of discharges at different capacitance of the capacitor experimental curves are approximated by exponential theoretical curves which are described to mathematical equations with approximation veracity r2 since the frequency of spark electric discharges is 1 hz the number of discharges corresponds to the duration of disinfection the concentration of total bacterial count in irrigation water should not exceed 106 cfu ml 1 28 wastewater from the zhulebinsky storm collector with an initial concentration of 1012 cfu ml 1 with a volume of 103 ml is disinfected to normal in 120 s with capacitance 0 1 Î¼f and in 180 s with capacitance 0 05 Î¼f wastewater from the kuryanovsky storm channel with an initial concentration of 109 cfu ml 1 with a volume of 103 ml is disinfected to normal in 100 s with capacitance 0 1 Î¼f and in 160 s with capacitance 0 05 Î¼f at a lower capacitance it was not possible to reduce the concentration of total bacterial count below 107 cfu ml 1 the statistical error was not higher 1 and was minimized due to the threefold repeatability of measurements fig 7 shows the dependence of the concentration of total bacterial count in the wastewater of the zhulebinsky storm collector and the kuryanovsky storm channel on the specific energy at the discharge energy 5 j the approximation theoretical curves their equations and veracity r2 are shown the change in the capacitance of the capacitor at a constant operating voltage of 10 kv corresponded to the change in the energy of each of the spark discharges 0 01 Î¼f 0 5 j 0 02 Î¼f 1 j 0 05 Î¼f 2 5 j 0 1 Î¼f 5 j to reduce the concentration of total bacterial count by 1 log the minimum duration of disinfection of 103 ml of wastewater was about 30 s at a discharge energy of 5 j ml 1 which is less than that of analogues 29 specific energy for ozonation of wastewater is about 700 j l 1 1 for the disinfection of wastewater by high voltage spark discharges the optimal specific energy of 600 j l 1 was experimentally obtained the capacity of equipment for ultraviolet wastewater disinfection is about 25 l h 1 30 the optimal capacity of the developed experimental setup was determined as 30 l h 1 the optimization criterion was the minimum duration the capacity of the setup can be increased due to additional pairs of electrodes and scaling of the operating device the proposed electrohydraulic method of wastewater disinfection has a higher energy efficiency compared to ozonation and a higher capacity compared to ultraviolet radiation electric and magnetic fields ultraviolet radiation shock waves sound vibrations free radicals and ions are the main factors in reduction of the total bacterial count in wastewater it results from the substantiation of the physical phenomena occurring during high voltage spark discharges in a liquid during spark discharges in the forming and working gaps a pulsed current of complex shape flows consisting of one or several bursts of about 103 104 a and a duration of 10 6 s the flow of impulse currents is based on two physical phenomena the release of energy in the form of heat in the conductors when the current flows through them and the creation of a magnetic field in the space surrounding the conductor and in the conductor itself in pulse modes huge rates of energy release and energy density are realized which are unattainable in stationary modes the flow of a pulsed current in a medium with a certain electrical conductivity causes heating of the medium often close to adiabatic when heated the mechanical properties of the medium its thermophysical parameters change and phase transitions occur thus a solid conductor can collapse melt and evaporate in the pulsed mode this process is accompanied by the appearance of powerful light radiation a shock wave and an electric arc the set of phenomena accompanying the flow of a high density pulsed current through a conductor can be considered as an electrical explosion of the conductor the flow of current is accompanied by a pulsed arc burning between the metal electrodes in places of contact between the metal and the arc erosion is observed evaporation melting and splashing of the metal erosion processes are determined by the rate of energy input into the electrode the cause of erosion is the surface heat source coming from the near electrode zone of the arc since the near electrode voltage drop is weakly dependent on current the energy entering the electrode is proportional to the charge carried by the current thus the degree of erosion depends on the amount of charge electrodynamic forces at high currents cause displacement deformation and destruction of current carrying conductors in pulse modes high current densities are achieved the values of electrodynamic forces can exceed the ultimate strength of the conductor material and the conductor is deformed and destroyed any pulse current generator is an energy storage device only comparatively small impulse currents can be obtained directly from the circuit without causing dangerous modes for the circuit close to short circuits in the storage device for a time exceeding the duration of the current pulse energy is accumulated in one form or another with a relatively small power consumed from the power source when the storage device is discharged high powers are developed within a short time which are necessary to generate a pulse current and pass it through the load in a capacitive storage energy is stored in the form of electrostatic energy in capacitors the accumulation process occurs when capacitors are charged from a low power high voltage rectifier and the discharge is caused by connecting the load through switching spark gaps most of the capacitive storage can be reduced to the simplest scheme of the discharge circuit consisting of capacitance inductance and active resistance charged to voltage in series the inductance includes the internal inductance of the drive the load inductance and the interconnecting busbars the stability of the characteristics of the spark gap during repeated operation is primarily determined by the material and shape of the electrodes but the working environment also plays a significant role in this matter in the developed experimental setup the working medium is wastewater the requirements for low electrical erosion preservation of an even surface relief after discharges are imposed on the materials of the spark gap electrodes this is necessary to maintain a stable static breakdown voltage of the arrester meeting these requirements leads to the use of arresters with a distributed discharge zone over small surface of the electrodes at high currents and times the discharge is contracted and the electrodes are exposed to intense heat at the reference points of the discharge channel in this case the correct choice of electrode material is important for long discharge times preference is given to materials containing highly volatile components despite the increased wear of such materials intensive evaporation leads to a smoother electrode surface in water spark gaps there is a wide range of breakdown voltages it is a consequence of the influence of environmental pollution by erosion products and uneven electrodes almost all of the molten metal is removed from the electrodes by powerful hydrodynamic flows arising from a pulsed spark discharge in water 3 2 time characteristics of high voltage spark discharges in wastewater the time characteristics of high voltage spark discharges in wastewater were investigated using equipment which consists of tds 5104b oscilloscope tektronix p6022 current probe skv100 kilovoltmeter and eone et201 ammeter fig 8 shows the dependences of changes in current and voltage on time in the discharge gap of the experimental setup for the disinfection of wastewater at the energy of each of the discharges 5 j ml 1 at the pre discharge stage the breakdown of the balls of the forming spark gap leads to a sharp increase in voltage across the working spark gap the voltage rises instantly the initial steeply rising section of the voltage curve from zero to a maximum value of 10 kv after avalanche ionization occurs streamers begin to grow in the wastewater from the volume of liquid to the high voltage electrode energy is consumed for the growth of streamers therefore a small voltage drop of 2 10 is observed in this section of the curve the growth of streamers is accompanied by the appearance of current in the streamer channel which is recorded by an oscillogram in the form of a hollow rising part of the current curve up to 102 a the pressures during the pre discharge stage are small liquid movement are also small practically absent there are no shock waves sound vibrations and ultraviolet radiation are very weak the growing strong electric field the magnetic field is small as soon as one of the streamers reaches the second electrode the pre discharge stage ends at the stage of the leading edge all the energy accumulated in the capacitor rushes into the streamer channel the current rapidly increases reaching a maximum value of 103 a high voltage spark discharges are generated this leads to an increase in the channel diameter and closure of the working gap at the same time a sharp drop in voltage is observed channel pressures rise sharply and reach maximum values the channel temperature rises to 103 104 c 31 the movements of the liquid are just starting but near the discharge zone they are maximal in acceleration shock waves are practically absent sound vibrations increase reaching a maximum a powerful rapidly growing magnetic field operates ultraviolet radiation reaches a maximum in the entire frequency range 0 4 1015 1 5 1015 hz characteristic of this mode 32 free radicals and ions begin to form at the trailing edge stage the process becomes oscillatory current and voltage pass through zero reverse polarity and decrease rapidly the pressures begin to drop sharply liquid movement are also small practically absent there are no shock waves sound vibrations and ultraviolet radiation are very weak the growing strong electric field the magnetic field is small as soon as one of the streamers reaches the second electrode the pre discharge stage ends movements reach maximum speed shock waves are formed sound vibrations and ultraviolet radiation are reduced an electric field of reverse polarity is growing the magnetic field contracts and decreases the concentration of free radicals and ions in wastewater is maximum at the stage of subsequent half waves not more than three half waves appear in the damped oscillatory circuit the pressures continue to fall the movement of the liquid reaches its maximum distance shock waves develop rapidly pass through the maximum and gradually decrease sound vibrations and ultraviolet radiation are attenuated electric and magnetic fields periodically decrease and increase with polarity reversal with decreasing amplitude at a lower energy of discharges the current and voltage will have lower amplitudes however the duration of each of the discharges will be the same since their frequency is constant at 1 hz 4 conclusions

oxidation coupling with iron reduction feammox are also recognized as the alternative measures for promoting the conversion of nh3 n to no2 n no3 n 19 20 integration of cw with microbial fuel cell cw mfc by implanting electrodes in the respective areas was used to promote no3 n elimination rate 21 22 resulting from electrochemical denitrification accomplished with electrons provided by electricity generating bacteria from anode 23 24 based on the above considerations the integration of ags aeration or fe based substrate and mfc into cws to compose a vertical cw mfc system including ags area and cw mfc area from bottom to top is an ideal method for promoting nitrogen pollution control and extending water purification scope of cw however the study of nitrogen conversion dynamic in artificial

days with initial total nitrogen tn concentration of 16 5 and 33 mg l respectively the hrt of ags area and cw mfc area continuously maintained at 4 9 h and 19 1 h respectively due to the different working volume of two areas variation of voltage across resistor was auto recorded by a uga 22 digital recorder hangzhou bright technology co ltd china every two minutes aeration rate of r1 12 h from

respectively in general effluent ph and do from r1 r2 and r3 decreased while ec greatly increased p 0 05 a decrease of effluent ph of r2 and r3 might be caused by the enhancive production of acid substances with fe based substrates during organics degradation 29 supplement of oxygen for ammoxidation via artificial aeration at night induced higher effluent do content of r1 due to the excellent degradation ability of ags organic loading rate olr was not a critical factor for the variation of effluent ph and do of three cw mfc reactors in this study 16 organic and amino acids such as acetic acid and glutamate secreted by microorganisms during the degradation of organic compounds could promote the release and mobilization of fe2 from fe based substrates 30 inducing the enhancement of ec in effluents in period i cod concentrations of influent r1 effluent r2 effluent and r3 effluent were 228 18 24 5 34 5 37 7 mg l respectively while they were 532 20 98 32 145 38 and 171 59 mg l during period ii fig 2a ags area of r1 r2 and r3 separately contributed to 36 6 46 5 and 45 5 of organics degradation during period i and they increased to 52 3 57 2 and 50 4 in period ii fig 2b and c for cw mfc area they decreased from 52 5 39 5 and 39 5 in period i to 31 3 17 4 and 20 5 in period ii during period ii the organics degradation of three reactors was improved gradually up by 32 in r3 integration of ags is a feasible pathway to improve organics conversion into low molecule in cw mfc under the olr of 36 78 g cod m2 d in this study ags area accounted for 20 of the total volume of reactor but it contributed to 36 57 of organics degradation high biomass density and effective mass transfer were the primary advantages for ags with a higher organic degradation performance which was consistent with the previous studies on uasb reactors 31 32 the organic degradation efficiency of ags area promoted with the enhancive olr during period ii indicating that coupling cw mfc with ags was conducive to its stable performance under a higher organic concentration even with a short hrt of 4 9 h 16 moreover organic degradation efficiency of ags area in r2 and r3 especially for r2 was higher than that of r1 lower ph value in these two reactors caused by the release of more acid substances such as protons malic and glutamate with a higher microbial metabolic activity inducing the mobilization of metal cations such as fe2 mg2 etc these ions played important roles in the formation and stabilization of ags 33 34 which has in turn promoted organics degradation performance of ags however organics degradation efficiency in the cw mfc area was greatly decreased during period ii indicating that inoculation of activated sludge was insufficient to handle wastewater with a higher organic concentration within the hrt of 19 1 h the organics degradation performance of three reactors is promoted as time goes on resulting from abundant anaerobic microorganisms in ags area even with a loose structure of ags at the end of period ii under an org n influent condition orgn 14 2 1 3 and 29 8 1 0 mg l in period i and period ii fig 3 effluent nitrogen from r1 r2 and r3 mainly consisted of nh3 n whose concentration is 3 2 1 6 9 1 1 2 10 6 0 9 mg l in period i and 14 6 1 8 19 4 1 6 20 6 1 5 mg l in period ii respectively fig 3b average ammonification efficiency of three reactors exhibited at 89 during the whole experimental stages fig 3e and f nitrification efficiency of r1 r2 and r3 were 80 10 43 9 and 34 5 in period i p 0 05 while they decreased to 55 6 43 6 and 36 5 in period ii p 0 05 respectively few no3 n was detected in the effluents fig 3c indicating that an approximately complete denitrification effect reached in these cw mfcs nitrogen conversion rate from org n to gaseous nitrogen generally determined its elimination efficiency from wastewater 35 coupling ags and mfc with cw contributed to a substantial enhancement of ammonification and denitrification routes during nitrogenous wastewater treatment this was resulted from an excellent organic degradation capacity of ags 36 and electrochemical denitrification induced by electrons from mfc anode 21 22 due to oxygen supported by aeration pump the conversion of nh3 n to no2 n no3 n in r1 via biological nitrification route was significantly higher than that of other reactors p 0 05 even so it sharply decreased to 55 during period ii which might be caused by a low aeration efficiency with low water depth in cw feammox was conducive to promote nitrification efficiency in r2 3 with electrons produced by electricity generating bacteria and then shuttled between fe2 and fe3 ions 20 which induced the average conversion efficiency of nh3 n to no2 n and no3 n increased from 18 up to 43 when compared with our previous study 16 overall artificial aeration or fe based substrate cw mfc associated with ags showed their superiority in nitrogen conversion dynamic under the relatively higher org n loading rates further investigation is still needed to promote nitrification rate for matching the balance of ammonification and denitrification efficiencies with the high cw mfc ags volume ratio in cw mfc associated with ags 3 2 microstructure and microbial community of ags after the end of the experiment ags sample from r1 was presented with a loose and flocculent structure while dense and stable granular property was observed with ags samples from r2 3 fig 4 the diameter of ags was 0 3 1 4 and 1 2 mm in r1 r2 and r3 respectively which was smaller than that of seeding ags Ï 2 4 mm as provided by the previous study 16 in addition many flocculent substances supposed to be filamentous bacteria were exhibited among the ags sample from r1 but they were rarely found in r2 3 the larger particle size of ags was conducive to a stable performance in organic conversion during wastewater treatment 37 as the previous studies showed metal cations such as fe2 mg2 etc play an important role in maintaining the formation and stability of ags via bridging and adsorption processes of fe and mg salts distributed in ags sulfide and or phosphate 33 34 the release of iron cations from fe based substrate availed for the dense and stable granular property in r2 3 when compared with that of r1 although the isolation of ags area and cw mfc area availed for maintaining a relatively large particle size of ags 16 its diameter was greatly decreased in three reactors on the 150th day after the operation especially for that of r1 this might be caused by the that a lot of filamentous bacteria were produced under a night aeration condition in r1 resulting in a significant decrease of organic degradation efficiency in the ags area when compared with r2 3 p 0 05 in addition with a doubled organic concentration during period ii the conversion of organics into low molecule compounds gradually improved by 18 32 indicating that the high efficiency of organic degradation in ags archaea such as phyla euryarchaeota average percentage ap 92 5 crenarchaeota ap 6 0 and bacteria including phyla firmicutes ap 67 2 proteobacteria ap 7 3 chloroflexi ap 6 4 bacteroidetes ap 4 6 were the dominant communities distributed in ags samples from the three reactors figs 5a and s2a methanomicrobia methanobacteria and thermoplasmata were the dominant archaeal classes in the ags area and the corresponding bacterial classes consisted of bacilli clostridia Î² Î³ and Î´ proteobacteria anaerolineae and bacteroidia the average ap of archaeal genera such as methanosaeta methanobacterium and unspecified methanobacteriaceae were 34 7 21 5 and 12 5 respectively fig 5c and trichococcus chloroflexi clostridium geobacter and desulfobulbus were the predominant bacterial genera observed in this study fig s2c methanogens can utilize substrates such as organic acids and carbon dioxide to obtain energy and produce ch4 via an anaerobic respiration pathway 38 the interactions of acid producing bacteria and methanogens play an important role in the efficient conversion of organics to low molecule compounds such as nh3 and ch4 39 compared with that of seeding ags 20 0 and 52 2 the relative abundance of genus methanosaeta in r1 r2 and r3 greatly increased to 50 4 31 6 and 36 7 but the percentage of genus methanobacterium gradually decreased to 10 3 9 3 and 14 4 respectively p 0 05 former and latter genera were individually proved as acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively 40 41 the various tendency of genera abundance is consistent with the previous study which enriched acetoclastic methanogens and reached a high ammonification efficiency in sca reactor during low strength wastewater treatment 18 in addition the significant enhancement of acid producing bacteria trichococcus r1 37 4 r2 69 4 r3 77 9 was conducive to yield formic acid acetic acid and lactic acid 42 inducing effective ch4 production and organics degradation with the metabolic activity of acetoclastic methanogens in ags area the enhancement of trichococcus in r2 3 was caused by the that the release of fe2 and fe3 from fe based substrate stimulated its growth due to it was generally agreed as the iron reducing bacteria 43 45 microbes such as anammox bacteria distributed in phylum chloroflexi were the important microbial communities involved in sludge granulation and biofilm formation of ags in uasb 46 47 hence ags maintained at a larger particle size in r2 3 contributed the interactions of bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens in organics degradation 3 3 anodic bacterial community the anodic areas of cw mfcs enriched bacterial communities including phyla firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes fig 6a and their average abundance was 52 0 21 9 1 9 5 4 and 6 6 respectively the corresponding bacterial classes consisted of bacilli Î² Î± Î³ and Î´ proteobacteria actinobacteria anaerolineae clostridia and bacteroidia fig 6b compared with that of seeding activated sludge fig 6c the ap of genus trichococcus carnobacteriaceae and clostridium greatly increased in r1 r2 and r3 p 0 05 while genera hyphomicrobium and mycobacterium significantly decreased in r2 3 p 0 05 notably r1 12 5 enriched more genus thiothrix than that of r2 3 0 4 p 0 05 the enhancement of electricity generating bacteria abundance was tightly related to bioelectricity generation and feammox in cw mfcs 48 genera trichococcus clostridium rhodobacter and geobacter were the common bacteria responsible for electron transfer at anode zone 49 the significant promotion of these bacteria in r2 3 further ensure stable bioenergy output in cw mfcs moreover volatile fatty acids and h2 are produced via the fermentation process with the above microorganisms which could be utilized as the electron donor for autotrophic denitrification 50 hence the enhancement of electricity generating bacteria was conducive to improve the electrochemical denitrification efficiency in cw mfcs 51 in addition fe2 released from fe based substrates could be acted as electron acceptor to generate fe3 under aerobic condition increasing evidences showed that electricity generating bacteria are also critical for feammox process 52 53 due to the accumulation of these bacterial communities nitrification efficiencies of r2 3 also promoted when compared with our previous study 16 however they were still lower than that of r1 due to the oxygen supplement was far more than fe3 content in cw mfcs during intermittent artificial aeration process hyphomicrobium and mycobacterium are considered as aerobic denitrification bacteria 54 but the low do conditions in r2 3 restricts their growth in ags area daily intermittent aeration condition of r1 might be the main reason for the high abundance of thiothrix 55 inducing a filamentous bulking in the ags area 3 4 bioelectricity generation due to seasonal changes effluent temperature ranged from 10 3 to 30 6 c inducing the fluctuations of voltage in cw mfc reactors especially from 40th day to the 70th day in the winter fig 7 daily average voltages of r1 r2 and r3 were 239 174 567 184 256 173 mv in period i while they were 405 191 644 191 379 184 mv during period ii the maximum value of power density obtained from polarization curve increased with olr up to 867 mw m2 1174 mw m2 439 mw m2 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively notably the enhancement of olr during period ii availed for power density in r1 r2 and r3 increased by 6 4 2 1 1 7 folds respectively bioelectricity generation from cw mfc reactor was tightly closed to microbial community and metabolic function 56 substance component and concentration 57 mass transfer efficiency 58 etc low temperature had a significant inhibition on carbon metabolism enzyme production and electron transfer 59 60 inducing the decrease of bioenergy output from cw mfc reactors in the winter daily voltage of the cw mfc system is promoted with the enhancive concentration of organics during period ii previous studies also indicated that higher olr availed for anaerobic metabolism and mass transfer efficiency of electricity generating bacteria producing electrons 57 61 hence the peak value of power density of three reactors all exhibited in period ii as reported in the previous study no3 n could be removed with a rate of 0 084 mg no3 n cm2 day in mfc 62 hence the stable bioenergy 239 644 mv output from cw mfcs could act as an important supplementary for electrochemical denitrification inducing an approximately complete denitrification effect in cw mfcs 4 conclusions artificial aeration or fe based substrates were used to enhance nitrogen conversion dynamic in cw mfcs associated with ags the conversation efficiencies of org n to nh3 n nh3 n to no2 n no3 n and no3 n to gaseous nitrogen in three reactors could reach 89 34 80 and 90 respectively interactions of acetoclastic methanogensand acid producing bacteria play an important role in the

beiyu china was used to test cod concentration 2 5 sludge sampling microbial community and microstructural property after the end of experiment microorganisms attached to the surface of anode electrode and ambient substrate 200 g were ultrasonicated for 15 min to obtain the sludge sample of cw mfc area mixed liquid 120 ml for ags analysis was collected from sampling port a of the ags area sludge samples were centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 5 min sigma 3 k15 germany then extracted dna sludge samples from the cw mfc area and ags area are used to analyze bacterial community and bacterial archaeal community universal primers of 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and its1f 5 cttggtcatttagaggaagtaa 3 were used to amplify the v4 region of bacterial genes in addition the v4 and v5 regions of

1018 61 us cm respectively the effluent was changed to 7 64 8 46 6 5 0 9 mg l 1045 103 us cm in r1 7 18 8 35 5 6 1 2 mg l 1091 118 us cm in r2 and 7 24 7 97 4 7 1 4 mg l 1127 118 us cm in r3 respectively in general effluent ph and do from r1 r2 and r3 decreased while ec greatly increased p 0 05 a decrease of effluent ph of r2 and r3 might be caused by the enhancive production of acid substances with fe based substrates during organics degradation 29 supplement of oxygen for ammoxidation via artificial aeration at night induced higher effluent do content of r1 due to the excellent degradation ability of ags organic loading rate olr was not a critical factor for the variation of effluent ph and do of three cw mfc reactors in this study 16 organic and amino acids such as acetic acid and glutamate secreted by microorganisms during the degradation of organic compounds could promote the release and mobilization of fe2 from fe based substrates 30 inducing the enhancement of ec in effluents in period i cod concentrations of influent r1 effluent r2 effluent and r3 effluent were 228 18 24 5 34 5 37 7 mg l respectively while they were 532 20 98 32 145 38 and 171 59 mg l during period ii fig 2a ags area of r1 r2 and r3 separately contributed to 36 6 46 5 and 45 5 of organics degradation during period i and they increased to 52 3 57 2 and 50 4 in period ii fig 2b and c for cw mfc area they decreased from 52 5 39 5 and 39 5 in period i to 31 3 17 4 and 20 5 in period ii during period ii the organics degradation of three reactors was improved gradually up by 32 in r3 integration of ags is a feasible pathway to improve organics conversion into low molecule in cw mfc under the olr of 36 78 g cod m2 d in this study ags area accounted for 20 of the total volume of reactor but it contributed to 36 57 of organics degradation high biomass density and effective mass transfer were the primary advantages for ags with a higher organic degradation performance which was consistent with the previous studies on uasb reactors 31 32 the organic degradation efficiency of ags area promoted with the enhancive olr during period ii indicating that coupling cw mfc with ags was conducive to its stable performance under a higher organic concentration even with a short hrt of 4 9 h 16 moreover organic degradation efficiency of ags area in r2 and r3 especially for r2 was higher than that of r1 lower ph value in these two reactors caused by the release of more acid substances such as protons malic and glutamate with a higher microbial metabolic activity inducing the mobilization of metal cations such as fe2 mg2 etc these ions played important roles in the formation and stabilization of ags 33 34 which has in turn promoted organics degradation performance of ags however organics degradation efficiency in the cw mfc area was greatly decreased during period ii indicating that inoculation of activated sludge was insufficient to handle wastewater with a higher organic concentration within the hrt of 19 1 h the organics degradation performance of three reactors is promoted as time goes on resulting from abundant anaerobic microorganisms in ags area even with a loose structure of ags at the end of period ii under an org n influent condition orgn 14 2 1 3 and 29 8 1 0 mg l in period i and period ii fig 3 effluent nitrogen from r1 r2 and r3 mainly consisted of nh3 n whose concentration is 3 2 1 6 9 1 1 2 10 6 0 9 mg l in period i and 14 6 1 8 19 4 1 6 20 6 1 5 mg l in period ii respectively fig 3b average ammonification efficiency of three reactors exhibited at 89 during the whole experimental stages fig 3e and f nitrification efficiency of r1 r2 and r3 were 80 10 43 9 and 34 5 in period i p 0 05 while they decreased to 55 6 43 6 and 36 5 in period ii p 0 05 respectively few no3 n was detected in the effluents fig 3c indicating that an approximately complete denitrification effect reached in these cw mfcs nitrogen conversion rate from org n to gaseous nitrogen generally determined its elimination efficiency from wastewater 35 coupling ags and mfc with cw contributed to a substantial enhancement of ammonification and denitrification routes during nitrogenous wastewater treatment this was resulted from an excellent organic degradation capacity of ags 36 and electrochemical denitrification induced by electrons from mfc anode 21 22 due to oxygen supported by aeration pump the conversion of nh3 n to no2 n no3 n in r1 via biological nitrification route was significantly higher than that of other reactors p 0 05 even so it sharply decreased to 55 during period ii which might be caused by a low aeration efficiency with low water depth in cw feammox was conducive to promote nitrification efficiency in r2 3 with electrons produced by electricity generating bacteria and then shuttled between fe2 and fe3 ions 20 which induced the average conversion efficiency of nh3 n to no2 n and no3 n increased from 18 up to 43 when compared with our previous study 16 overall artificial aeration or fe based substrate cw mfc associated with ags showed their superiority in nitrogen conversion dynamic under the relatively higher org n loading rates further investigation is still needed to promote nitrification rate for matching the balance of ammonification and denitrification efficiencies with the high cw mfc ags volume ratio in cw mfc associated with ags 3 2 microstructure and microbial community of ags after the end of the experiment ags sample from r1 was presented with a loose and flocculent structure while dense and stable granular property was observed with ags samples from r2 3 fig 4 the diameter of ags was 0 3 1 4 and 1 2 mm in r1 r2 and r3 respectively which was smaller than that of seeding ags Ï 2 4 mm as provided by the previous study 16 in addition many flocculent substances supposed to be filamentous bacteria were exhibited among the ags sample from r1 but they were rarely found in r2 3 the larger particle size of ags was conducive to a stable performance in organic conversion during wastewater treatment 37 as the previous studies showed metal cations such as fe2 mg2 etc play an important role in maintaining the formation and stability of ags via bridging and adsorption processes of fe and mg salts distributed in ags sulfide and or phosphate 33 34 the release of iron cations from fe based substrate availed for the dense and stable granular property in r2 3 when compared with that of r1 although the isolation of ags area and cw mfc area availed for maintaining a relatively large particle size of ags 16 its diameter was greatly decreased in three reactors on the 150th day after the operation especially for that of r1 this might be caused by the that a lot of filamentous bacteria were produced under a night aeration condition in r1 resulting in a significant decrease of organic degradation efficiency in the ags area when compared with r2 3 p 0 05 in addition with a doubled organic concentration during period ii the conversion of organics into low molecule compounds gradually improved by 18 32 indicating that the high efficiency of organic degradation in ags archaea such as phyla euryarchaeota average percentage ap 92 5 crenarchaeota ap 6 0 and bacteria including phyla firmicutes ap 67 2 proteobacteria ap 7 3 chloroflexi ap 6 4 bacteroidetes ap 4 6 were the dominant communities distributed in ags samples from the three reactors figs 5a and s2a methanomicrobia methanobacteria and thermoplasmata were the dominant archaeal classes in the ags area and the corresponding bacterial classes consisted of bacilli clostridia Î² Î³ and Î´ proteobacteria anaerolineae and bacteroidia the average ap of archaeal genera such as methanosaeta methanobacterium and unspecified methanobacteriaceae were 34 7 21 5 and 12 5 respectively fig 5c and trichococcus chloroflexi clostridium geobacter and desulfobulbus were the predominant bacterial genera observed in this study fig s2c methanogens can utilize substrates such as organic acids and carbon dioxide to obtain energy and produce ch4 via an anaerobic respiration pathway 38 the interactions of acid producing bacteria and methanogens play an important role in the efficient conversion of organics to low molecule compounds such as nh3 and ch4 39 compared with that of seeding ags 20 0 and 52 2 the relative abundance of genus methanosaeta in r1 r2 and r3 greatly increased to 50 4 31 6 and 36 7 but the percentage of genus methanobacterium gradually decreased to 10 3 9 3 and 14 4 respectively p 0 05 former and latter genera were individually proved as acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively 40 41 the various tendency of genera abundance is consistent with the previous study which enriched acetoclastic methanogens and reached a high ammonification efficiency in sca reactor during low strength wastewater treatment 18 in addition the significant enhancement of acid producing bacteria trichococcus r1 37 4 r2 69 4 r3 77 9 was conducive to yield formic acid acetic acid and lactic acid 42 inducing effective ch4 production and organics degradation with the metabolic activity of acetoclastic methanogens in ags area the enhancement of trichococcus in r2 3 was caused by the that the release of fe2 and fe3 from fe based substrate stimulated its growth due to it was generally agreed as the iron reducing bacteria 43 45 microbes such as anammox bacteria distributed in phylum chloroflexi were the important microbial communities involved in sludge granulation and biofilm formation of ags in uasb 46 47 hence ags maintained at a larger particle size in r2 3 contributed the interactions of bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens in organics degradation 3 3 anodic bacterial community the anodic areas of cw mfcs enriched bacterial communities including phyla firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes fig 6a and their average abundance was 52 0 21 9 1 9 5 4 and 6 6 respectively the corresponding bacterial classes consisted of bacilli Î² Î± Î³ and Î´ proteobacteria actinobacteria anaerolineae clostridia and bacteroidia fig 6b compared with that of seeding activated sludge fig 6c the ap of genus trichococcus carnobacteriaceae and clostridium greatly increased in r1 r2 and r3 p 0 05 while genera hyphomicrobium and mycobacterium significantly decreased in r2 3 p 0 05 notably r1 12 5 enriched more genus thiothrix than that of r2 3 0 4 p 0 05 the enhancement of electricity generating bacteria abundance was tightly related to bioelectricity generation and feammox in cw mfcs 48 genera trichococcus clostridium rhodobacter and geobacter were the common bacteria responsible for electron transfer at anode zone 49 the significant promotion of these bacteria in r2 3 further ensure stable bioenergy output in cw mfcs moreover volatile fatty acids and h2 are produced via the fermentation process with the above microorganisms which could be utilized as the electron donor for autotrophic denitrification 50 hence the enhancement of electricity generating bacteria was conducive to improve the electrochemical denitrification efficiency in cw mfcs 51 in addition fe2 released from fe based substrates could be acted as electron acceptor to generate fe3 under aerobic condition increasing evidences showed that electricity generating bacteria are also critical for feammox process 52 53 due to the accumulation of these bacterial communities nitrification efficiencies of r2 3 also promoted when compared with our previous study 16 however they were still lower than that of r1 due to the oxygen supplement was far more than fe3 content in cw mfcs during intermittent artificial aeration process hyphomicrobium and mycobacterium are considered as aerobic denitrification bacteria 54 but the low do conditions in r2 3 restricts their growth in ags area daily intermittent aeration condition of r1 might be the main reason for the high abundance of thiothrix 55 inducing a filamentous bulking in the ags area 3 4 bioelectricity generation due to seasonal changes effluent temperature ranged from 10 3 to 30 6 c inducing the fluctuations of voltage in cw mfc reactors especially from 40th day to the 70th day in the winter fig 7 daily average voltages of r1 r2 and r3 were 239 174 567 184 256 173 mv in period i while they were 405 191 644 191 379 184 mv during period ii the maximum value of power density obtained from polarization curve increased with olr up to 867 mw m2 1174 mw m2 439 mw m2 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively notably the enhancement of olr during period ii availed for power density in r1 r2 and r3 increased by 6 4 2 1 1 7 folds respectively bioelectricity generation from cw mfc reactor was tightly closed to microbial community and metabolic function 56 substance component and concentration 57 mass transfer efficiency 58 etc low temperature had a significant inhibition on carbon metabolism enzyme production and electron transfer 59 60 inducing the decrease of bioenergy output from cw mfc reactors in the winter daily voltage of the cw mfc system is promoted with the enhancive concentration of organics during period ii previous studies also indicated that higher olr availed for anaerobic metabolism and mass transfer efficiency of electricity generating bacteria producing electrons 57 61 hence the peak value of power density of three reactors all exhibited in period ii as reported in the previous study no3 n could be removed with a rate of 0 084 mg no3 n cm2 day in mfc 62 hence the stable bioenergy 239 644 mv output from cw mfcs could act as an important supplementary for electrochemical denitrification inducing an approximately complete denitrification effect in cw mfcs 4 conclusions artificial aeration or fe based substrates were used to enhance nitrogen conversion dynamic in cw mfcs associated with ags the conversation efficiencies of org n to nh3 n nh3 n to no2 n no3 n and no3 n to gaseous nitrogen in three reactors could reach 89 34 80 and 90 respectively interactions of acetoclastic methanogensand acid producing bacteria play an important role in the highly efficient conversion of org n to nh3 n fe based substrates enriched electricity generating bacteria including trichococcus clostridium rhodobacter and geobacter can participate in feammox stable bioenergy output could act as an important supplementary for electrochemical denitrification anaerobic granular sludge coupled with artificial aeration or fe based substrates are ideal technologies to enhance nitrogen conversion dynamic and achieve sustainably nitrogenous wastewater treatment based on cw mfcs further investigation is required to explore the integration of artificial aeration and fe based substrates to ensure low ammonia concentration in effluent based on high cathode volume in cw mfc associated with ags declaration of competing interest the authors declare no
