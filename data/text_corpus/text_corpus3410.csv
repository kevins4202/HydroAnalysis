17050,rapid achievement of nitritation of mainstream municipal wastewater in a continuous flow process is attractive since it favors the involvement of the anammox process and reduces the operational costs in this study a feasible and economical strategy is proposed to rapidly achieve the nitritation of municipal wastewater by aggressively discharging excess sludge during the seasonal warming period temperature increasing from 18 c to 22 c nitritation was established in 15 days with a nitrite accumulation ratio of 85 09 in a continuous flow anaerobic oxic an o reactor meanwhile qpcr results revealed that amoa abundance increased from 1 78 0 10 108 copies g vss to 1 05 0 11 1010 copies g vss while the abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria decreased from 1 1 0 02 1010 copies g vss to 5 01 0 02 108 copies g vss the temperature gradually stabilized at 26 c during the following operational period and stable nitritation was maintained with a nitrite accumulation ratio above 90 which was mainly attributed to a short sludge retention time srt of 4 3 days and a low dissolved oxygen of 0 86 0 5 mg l falling temperature negatively impacted the stability of nitritation but nitritation could be restarted by aggressively discharging excess sludge during another temperature increase period overall this study provides a feasible strategy to start up nitritation that has great potential applications for municipal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob an o process municipal wastewater nitritation

nitritation and anammox an autotrophic nitrogen removal process promotes the transformation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps from energy intensive to energy self sufficient or even energy producers agrawal et al 2018 however the application of the nitritation anammox process in low ammonia wastewater system faces some challenges the primary bottleneck is the unstable supply of nitrite du et al 2019 nitrite for anammox could be supplied by nitritation partial denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra cui et al 2020 wang et al 2021 since nitritation pathway ammonium to nitrite through ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob can reduce aeration energy consumption and save up to 100 of organic matter requirements it is considered to be a more promising nitrite supply pathway li et al 2019 however the nitrite supplied by nitritation is also available to be consumed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob li et al 2020 enrichment of nob causes the out competition of anammox bacteria leading to the deterioration of nitrogen removal performance joss et al 2011 yoo et al 1999 therefore stable nitritation by selectively suppressing nob is a key to successful application of anammox in municipal wastewater treatment in full scale wwtps worldwide continuous flow reactors are commonly adopted li et al 2021 ma et al 2016 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2020 however sewage nitritation in a continuous flow reactor is more difficult to achieve when compared to sequencing batch reactors sbr choi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 so far different strategies have been developed to selectively eliminate nob while retaining aob with the purpose of maintaining stable nitritation in lab and full scale continuous reactors among these proposed strategies dissolved oxygen do control online aeration control addition of selective inhibitors and bio augmentation are regarded as feasible methods ma et al 2009 zhu et al 2017 regmi et al 2014 kindaichi et al 2004 li et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 however these strategies usually increase operational costs and complexity or require a comparatively longer time 40 60 days to start up nitritation hao and chen 1994 herrero and stuckey 2015 li et al 2019 zeng et al 2011 hence developing economical and effective control strategies is still necessary to achieve rapid nitritation and maintain it for long term aggressive sludge discharge is a convenient way to promote sewage nitritation this is because nob s specific growth rate is negative when the sludge retention time srt is less than its minimum doubling time salem et al 2003 the so called sharon single reactor high activity ammonia removal over nitrite process can achieve stable nitritation by maintaining an srt of less than two days which has been established in lab and full scale systems hellinga et al 1998 mulder et al 2001 galí et al 2007 also demonstrated that stable nitritation could be achieved by maintaining an srt of five days at 30 c it is to be noted that most of these successful studies were carried out at high temperatures 30 c 40 c since nitrification activity is unaffected by aggressive sludge discharge under high temperature in contrast for establishing sewage nitritation at moderate temperatures 18 c 25 c aggressive sludge discharge is unfavorable since a long term start up period is required and the aob activity is lower than expected for wwtps located in the temperate zones aggressively discharging excess sludge when temperatures begin to increase might be a feasible way to start up nitritation since the growth of aob and the elimination of nob are both enhanced rapidly realizing nitritation by adjusting excess sludge discharge is feasible when taking advantage of the seasonal warming process but the performance of this strategy in starting up sewage nitritation and the stability of the established nitritation at varied temperatures remain unclear accordingly the primary aim of this study is to develop a convenient strategy to achieve long term stable sewage nitritation in a continuous flow an o process at actual ambient temperature excess sludge was aggressively discharged as the temperature increased the long term performance of nitritation in the reactor was evaluated over 200 days during the experiment variations in the activities and abundances of aob and nob were also investigated to explore the underlying mechanism of nitritation establishment potential applications for controlling the ultra low sludge retention time ul srt are also addressed this study provides a practical engineering alternative for sewage nitritation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 24 l was made of polymethyl methacrylate and divided into four equal chambers the first chamber was the anaerobic zone and the other three chambers were the aerobic zones which were named o1 o2 and o3 fig 1 in the aerobic zone aeration was provided by an air compression pump through sand bubble diffusers and the aeration rate was controlled by a rotameter peristaltic pumps were used to control the flow rate of influent and returned

anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of the inoculated sludge were 5063 mg l and 3066 mg l respectively 2 3 experimental procedure the experimental procedure was divided into five phases according to the variations in temperature srt and aeration modes in phase i the temperature was gradually increased from 16 c to 25 c while the srt was maintained at 4 6 days and the do concentration was 2 4 mg l in all the three chambers in phase ii the temperature was stabilized at 25 c 26 c and the srt was 4 4 3 days the do concentrations were sequentially controlled at 1 2 mg l 0 5 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l in the three aerobic chambers o1 o2 and o3 respectively by manually controlling the air flow rate via rotameters tokutomi 2004 in phase iii the temperature dropped from 26 c to 19 c the srt and aeration control were identical to phase ii in phase iv the temperature was gradually increased from 20 c to 26 c using a heater meanwhile the srt was extended to six days in phase v the temperature was stabilized at 25 c 26 c and the srt was decreased from 6 to 4 3 days the detailed experimental conditions and operational parameters under different phases are summarized in table 1 2 4 analytical methods the wastewater samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm filter prior to the analysis the concentrations of nh4 no2 no3 po4 3 cod mlss and mlvss in the mixed liquor samples were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 the concentration of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas was determined by the sum of the concentrations of poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and poly β hydroxyvalerate phv phas and glycogen gly were analyzed using freeze dried biomass as described by a previous study oehmen 2006 the temperature ph and do were monitored using oxygen and ph probes multi 340i wtw company germany 2 5 bacterial activity determination a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the activity changes of aob and nob in the reactor during various phases specifically 1 l of activated sludge was withdrawn from the aerobic zone o3 and was washed with distilled water three times before being divided into two equal parts these were then placed in two sbrs working volume of 2 l at the beginning of the batch tests nh4cl and nano2 were added resulting in an initial nh4 n and no2 n concentration of 20 mg l the initial ph was about 7 5 then reactors were continuously aerated for 2 5 h at a temperature of 26 c 1 c and do concentration over 6 mg l mixed liquor samples were collected every 10 min to analyze the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite the oxidation rate of the ammonia and nitrite per unit sludge concentrations were used to characterize the activity of aob and nob respectively 2 6 dna extraction and quantitative real time pcr to analyze the variations in the abundance of nitrifiers the abundances of aob amoa gene and nob nitrospira spp and nitrobacter spp were determined using qpcr the dna was extracted following the manufacturer s protocol of the fast dnatm spin kit qbiogene inc carlsbad ca usa the stratagene mx3005p real time pcr system agilent

and discussion 3 1 rapid enrichment of aob using an ultra low sludge retention time during the initial period of phase i 1 32 d the average temperature was 18 c and the mlss was 5000 300 mg l under a srt of six days fig 2 b although do concentration was controlled at 2 4 mg l in all the aerobic zones the ammonia removal efficiency during this phase was only 10 2 3 3 with influent nh4 n and cod concentrations of 71 3 9 5 mg l and 223 6 35 8 mg l respectively the effluent nh4 n and nox n nox n no2 n no3 n were 65 2 3 4 and 0 75 0 48 mg l respectively fig 2 suggesting that nitrification activity was suppressed during the latter period of phase i 33 44 d the temperature gradually increased from 18 c to 22 c and the average sludge concentration was reduced from 4981 300 mg l to 3406 100 mg l by reducing the srt from 6 to 4 days fig 2b although srt was reduced the ammonium removal efficiency increased from 14 3 to 50 1 with the temperature rise fig 2a additionally nitrite accumulation was observed with the effluent no2 n concentration of 9 25 mg l the nitrite accumulation ratio was as high as 85 in the continuous flow an o reactor without any chemical additives or aeration control during the temperature increase period 33 44 d aob amoa was enriched but nob was selectively eliminated under a low srt of four days the abundance of amoa increased from 1 78 0 10 108 copies g vss to 1 05 0 11 1010 copies g vss while the abundance of nob decreased from 1 1 0 02 1010 copies g vss to 5 01 0 02 108 copies g vss fig 4 day 44 aob activity 5 28 0 20 mg n g vss h became much higher than that of nob activity 0 47 0 08 mg n g vss h resulting in the establishment of nitritation fig 3 day 44 the increase in temperature also favored the enhancement of aob activity heijnen et al 1998 in phase i aob amoa abundance was increased even when mlss decreased from 5000 mg l to 3400 mg l while nob growth was not promoted which were gradually eliminated from the reactor apart from the increase in temperature high residual ammonia nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen loading rate is also reported to favor the start up of nitritation poot et al 2016 effluent ammonium was as high as 65 2 3 4 mg n l during the initial period of phase i and the ammonia nitrogen loading rate of 0 55 0 12 g n l d was much higher than that observed in a conventional sewage treatment reactor overall these results suggested that aggressive sludge discharge and increased temperature could selectively enrich aob amoa and eliminate nob resulting in the start up of sewage nitritation 3 2 maintenance of nitritation under constant and dropping temperatures in phase ii the temperature was 25 5 1 1 c during the initial period of 45 58 d the mlss was reduced to 2400 200 mg l fig 2b due to the ultra low srt of four days meanwhile the ammonium removal efficiency decreased from 55 to 44 fig 2a in addition nitrate gradually increased and the nitrite accumulation ratio decreased from 85 to 67 fig 2c after the long term aggressive sludge discharge the activity of aob decreased from 5 28 0 20 mg n g vss h to 5 07 0 02 mg n g vss h but the activity of nob increased from 0 47 0 08 mg n g vss h to 1 75 0 08 mg n g vss h these results indicated that maintaining a low srt failed to continuously suppress nob in this study during the following period of phase ii 59 127 d the srt was extended to 4 3 days and the aeration was reduced moreover a tapered aeration was adopted the do concentration in three aerobic chambers o1 o2 o3 was controlled at 1 2 mg l 0 5 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively thereafter the mlss was increased to 2944 200 mg l while the activity of aob was observed to increase from 5 07 0 12 mg n g vss h to 7 2 0 15 mg n g vss h and the activity of nob was observed to decrease from 1 75 0 08 mg n g vss h to 0 42 0 03 mg n g vss h fig 3 moreover the abundance of amoa increased from 1 05 0 12 1010 copies g vss on day 44 to 1 51 0 03 1010 copies g vss on day 101 fig 4 these results suggested that by maintaining an appropriate srt and a low do concentration the activity of aob and abundance of aob amoa could be improved with the increase of mlss these conditions resulted in a nitrite accumulation ratio above 90 in 18 days which stabilized at 93 0 4 1 fig 2c during phase iii the temperature dropped from 26 c to 19 c in 14 days and the ammonium removal efficiency was decreased to 20 fig 2b although a low do concentration was adopted the nitrite accumulation ratio decreased from 92 7 to 63 4 fig 2c the aob activity decreased from 7 2 0 15 mg n g vss h to 3 8 0 29 mg n g vss h while the nob activity increased from 0 42 0 03 mg n g vss h to 0 67 0 04 mg n g vss h the abundance of amoa decreased from 1 51 0 03 1010 copies g vss to 1 37 0 10 108 copies g vss fig 4 day 145 in contrast nob abundance was less affected and was basically unchanged from 6 39 0 22 108 copies g vss to 4 25 0 26 108 copies g vss thus aob amoa abundance was sharply decreased when temperature dropped resulting in the decline of nitritation the prerequisite for achieving nitritation is the washout and suppression of nob ma et al 2016 nitrospira was the dominant nob population in the inoculated sludge whose abundance decreased from 1 02 0 05 1010 copies g vss to 6 13 0 02 107 copies g vss due to aggressive sludge discharge during temperature increase while the abundance of the nitrobacter decreased from 8 12 0 50 108 copies g vss to 4 40 0 49 108 copies g vss only the reason for this difference in abundance as shown in table 2 is that nitrobacter species have higher maximum specific growth rate μmax than nitrospira thus with aggressive sludge discharge nitrospira with lower μmax was more likely to be washed out in a low srt system resulting in a decrease in the abundance of nob eq 1 at the phase ii 59 127 d the operation mode of tapered aeration was adopted with the do concentration in the aerobic chambers o1 o2 and o3 sequentially controlled at 1 2 mg l 0 5 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively this was unfavorable for the growth of nitrobacter since they have a higher dissolved oxygen half saturation coefficient table 2 therefore ultra low sludge retention time 4 4 3 days and do control made a great contribution to eliminate nob nitrobacter and nitrospira and achieve stable nitritation 1 d x nob x nob d t μ nob 1 srtnob b nob 3 3 the recurrence of nitritation during phase iv the effect of temperature rise on the start up of nitritation was investigated the temperature increased from 20 c to 26 c in 18 days and finally stabilized at 26 1 c at this time the sludge concentration was observed to increase to 4500 5000 mg l and the activities of aob and nob were only 0 28 0 05 mg n g vss h and 0 21 0 01 mg n g vss h respectively fig 3 day 174 meanwhile the abundance of aob amoa was not increased 1 95 0 08 108 copies g vss and was lower than that of nob 5 31 0 24 108 copies g vss it should be noted that during this temperature increase period the sludge discharge amount was less than that in phase i and phase ii these results suggest that raising the temperature can fail to start up nitritation if srt is inappropriate it also may explain why nitrite accumulation occurs only rarely during the operation of actual wwtps during phase v the srt was decreased from 6 days to 4 3 days by increasing excess sludge discharge the mlss was observed to decrease from 4700 mg l to 3200 mg l fig 2 b and the ammonium removal efficiency increased from 11 2 to 52 6 in 10 days the abundance of amoa increased from 1 95 0 08 108 copies g vss to 1 09 0 10 109 copies g vss day 200 and the abundance of nob decreased from 5 31 0 24 108 copies g vss to 2 24 0 09 108 copies g vss aob activity was 7 15 0 16 mg n g vss h which was much higher than nob activity 0 68 0 08 mg n g vss h therefore nitritation was observed to resume and the nitrite accumulation ratio stabilized at 90 7 this indicated that the increase in temperature coupled with low srt can quickly and stably achieve nitritation summarizing the decrease in mlss under the ultra low srt might be an important factor in achieving nitritation 3 4 microbial community analysis of the ultra low sludge retention time system to better understand the impact of microbial community differences on nitrifying bacteria high throughput sequencing was employed to investigate the sludge samples on day 0 inoculated sludge and day 98 steady phase nitrosomonas 0 19 and nitrospira 2 40 were the sole aob and nob genus respectively in full scale aao reactor on day 0 fig 6 after introducing the control strategy of ultra low sludge retention time and tapered aeration the relative abundance of nitrosomonas increased from 0 19 to 0 79 in addition nitrosospira which is aob was also detected with a relative abundance of 0 06 whereas nitrospira was gradually washed out of the system from 2 4 relative abundance to below detection level fig 6 it is also to be noted that nitrotoga was detected in the reactor as a nob which has unusual tolerance to extreme environmental conditions zheng et al 2021 with a relative abundance of 0 073 the dominant genus top 20 observed on day 98 of the reactor operation are presented in fig s1 among these various genera of heterotrophic bacteria possessing biological phosphorus removal abilities were detected in the an o reactor with an ultra low sludge retention time the paos affiliated with genera candidatus accumulibacter tetrasphaera halomonas candidatus microthrix and pseudomonas were identified with abundances of 3 38 1 25 0 61 0 30 and 0 01 respectively wang et al 2019b fig 6 day 98 additionally gaos were also detected in the an o reactor such as dechloromonas 3 91 candidatus competibacter 3 49 and defluviicoccu 0 069 ji et al 2018 wang et al 2008 fig 6 day 98 compared with day 0 the relative abundance of paos and gaos increased from 2 51 and 4 05 to 5 55 and 7 48 respectively on day 98 fig 6 the paos and gaos are the type of facultative bacteria most of which could transform carbon sources into phas anaerobically and use them for aerobic growth ji et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 b the organic substances are preferentially used by paos and gaos in the anaerobic chamber and stored in the form of phas these accumulated phas can be utilized by paos and gaos for respiratory metabolism even though the cod in the aerobic chamber was less than 45 mg l this strengthens the competition for do in the aerobic zone with aob having a competitive advantage over nob under oxygen limited conditions picioreanu et al 1997 additionally the genera involved in endogenous denitrification such as denitratisoma 3 91 and candidatus competibacter 3 49 may contribute to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification thus inhibiting nob ji et al 2020 the results of high throughput sequencing indicated that the enrichment of endogenous heterotrophic bacteria paos and gaos may be an important reason for the achievement of nitritation in the current study 3 5 application prospects this study demonstrated that aggressively discharging excess sludge during the temperature increase period could rapidly initiate nitritation in a continuous flow an o reactor for the treatment of actual municipal wastewater also the stable maintenance of nitritation could be achieved by controlling do and adjusting srt in this way the re occurrence of sewage nitritation could be achieved during a specific period every year it is worth noting that the ultra low sludge retention time control strategy can achieve continuous system nitritation within 15 days by controlling excess sludge discharge without the addition of any chemical agents in addition the average effluent phosphorus and cod concentration of 0 96 and 43 1 mg l were observed fig 2 d thus biological phosphorus removal can be simultaneously achieved in the an o continuous flow system with an ultra low sludge retention time of 4 4 3 days fig 5 day 101 therefore seasonal nitritation can be achieved even with temperature changes without affecting the phosphorus removal effect of the system which can be easily applied in actual projects for future studies the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus may be achieved by further connection to an autotrophic nitrogen removal system the large amount of excess sludge produced by the ultra low srt system could be used for anaerobic digestion to achieve energy and phosphorus recovery this potential application requires more research since it is the key to the transformation of wastewater treatment plants from energy intensive to energy self sufficient 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of the rapid start up and stable maintenance of nitritation in the continuous flow anaerobic oxic process via the ul srt the primary conclusions are 1 nitritation could be rapidly initiated within 15 days by using the ul srt and controlling the do at a high level 2 4 mg l during seasonal warming 2 the combination of the ul srt 4 4 3 days and tapered aeration was found to be a suitable method to establish stable nitritation the ul srt was key for achieving nitritation in the continuous flow an o system to treat actual municipal wastewater under tapered aeration conditions 3 by taking advantage of the differences between the specific growth rates and substrate affinities of nitrobacter and nitrospira the ul srt and do control can be used to wash out nitrospira with a lower specific growth rate and inhibit the nitrobacter with lower oxygen affinity 4 in the ul srt system the decrease of temperature causes the abundance of aob amoa to decrease rapidly which adversely impacts the stability of nitritation thus further research is required to research long term stable nitritation in the an o reactor with ul srt under low temperature conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of the inoculated sludge were 5063 mg l and 3066 mg l respectively 2 3 experimental procedure the experimental procedure was divided into five phases according to the variations in temperature srt and aeration modes in phase i the temperature was gradually increased from 16 c to 25 c while the srt was maintained at 4 6 days and the do concentration was 2 4 mg l in all the three chambers in phase ii the temperature was stabilized at 25 c 26 c and the srt was 4 4 3 days the do concentrations were sequentially controlled at 1 2 mg l 0 5 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l in the three aerobic chambers o1 o2 and o3 respectively by manually controlling the air flow rate via rotameters tokutomi 2004 in phase iii the temperature dropped from 26 c to 19 c the srt and aeration control were identical to phase ii in phase iv the temperature was gradually increased from 20 c to 26 c using a heater meanwhile the srt was extended to six days in phase v the temperature was stabilized at 25 c 26 c and the srt was decreased from 6 to 4 3 days the detailed experimental conditions and operational parameters under different phases are summarized in table 1 2 4 analytical methods the wastewater samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm filter prior to the analysis the concentrations of nh4 no2 no3 po4 3 cod mlss and mlvss in the mixed liquor samples were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 the concentration of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas was determined by the sum of the concentrations of poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and poly β hydroxyvalerate phv phas and glycogen gly were analyzed using freeze dried biomass as described by a previous study oehmen 2006 the temperature ph and do were monitored using oxygen and ph probes multi 340i wtw company germany 2 5 bacterial activity determination a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the activity changes of aob and nob in the reactor during various phases specifically 1 l of activated sludge was withdrawn from the aerobic zone o3 and was washed with distilled water three times before being divided into two equal parts these were then placed in two sbrs working volume of 2 l at the beginning of the batch tests nh4cl and nano2 were added resulting in an initial nh4 n and no2 n

collected every 10 min to analyze the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite the oxidation rate of the ammonia and nitrite per unit sludge concentrations were used to characterize the activity of aob and nob respectively 2 6 dna extraction and quantitative real time pcr to analyze the variations in the abundance of nitrifiers the abundances of aob amoa gene and nob nitrospira spp and nitrobacter spp were determined using qpcr the dna was extracted following the manufacturer s protocol of the fast dnatm spin kit qbiogene inc carlsbad ca usa the stratagene mx3005p real time pcr system agilent

and discussion 3 1 rapid enrichment of aob using an ultra low sludge retention time during the initial period of phase i 1 32 d the average temperature was 18 c and the mlss was 5000 300 mg l under a srt of six days fig 2 b although do concentration was controlled at 2 4 mg l in all the aerobic zones the ammonia removal efficiency during this phase was only 10 2 3 3 with influent nh4 n and cod concentrations of 71 3 9 5 mg l and 223 6 35 8 mg l respectively the effluent nh4 n and nox n nox n no2 n no3 n were 65 2 3 4 and 0 75 0 48 mg l respectively fig 2 suggesting that nitrification activity was suppressed during the latter period of phase i 33 44 d the temperature gradually increased from 18 c to 22 c and the average sludge concentration was reduced from 4981 300 mg l to 3406 100 mg l by reducing the srt from 6 to 4 days fig 2b although srt was reduced the ammonium removal efficiency increased from 14 3 to 50 1 with the temperature rise fig 2a additionally nitrite accumulation was observed with the effluent no2 n concentration of 9 25 mg l the nitrite accumulation ratio was as high as 85 in the continuous flow an o reactor without any chemical additives or aeration control during the temperature increase period 33 44 d aob amoa was enriched but nob was selectively eliminated under a low srt of four days the abundance of amoa increased from 1 78 0 10 108 copies g vss to 1 05 0 11 1010 copies g vss while the abundance of nob decreased from 1 1 0 02 1010 copies g vss to 5 01 0 02 108 copies g vss fig 4 day 44 aob activity 5 28 0 20 mg n g vss h became much higher than that of nob activity 0 47 0 08 mg n g vss h resulting in the establishment of nitritation fig 3 day 44 the increase in temperature also favored the enhancement of aob activity heijnen et al 1998 in phase i aob amoa abundance was increased even when mlss decreased from 5000 mg l to 3400 mg l while nob growth was not promoted which were gradually eliminated from the reactor apart from the increase in temperature high residual ammonia nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen loading rate is also reported to favor the start up of nitritation poot et al 2016 effluent ammonium was as high as 65 2 3 4 mg n l during the initial period of phase i and the ammonia nitrogen loading rate of 0 55 0 12 g n l d was much higher than that observed in a conventional sewage treatment reactor overall these results suggested that aggressive sludge discharge and increased temperature could selectively enrich aob amoa and eliminate nob resulting in the start up of sewage nitritation 3 2 maintenance of nitritation under constant and dropping temperatures in phase ii the temperature was 25 5 1 1 c during the initial period of 45 58 d the mlss was reduced to 2400 200 mg l fig 2b due to the ultra low srt of four days meanwhile the ammonium removal efficiency decreased from 55 to 44 fig 2a in addition nitrate gradually increased and the nitrite accumulation ratio decreased from 85 to 67 fig 2c after the long term aggressive sludge discharge the activity of aob decreased from 5 28 0 20 mg n g vss h to 5 07 0 02 mg n g vss h but the activity of nob increased from 0 47 0 08 mg n g vss h to 1 75 0 08 mg n g vss h these results indicated that maintaining a low srt failed to continuously suppress nob in this study during the following period of phase ii 59 127 d the srt was extended to 4 3 days and the aeration was reduced moreover a tapered aeration was adopted the do concentration in three aerobic chambers o1 o2 o3 was controlled at 1 2 mg l 0 5 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively thereafter the mlss was increased to 2944 200 mg l while the activity of aob was observed to increase from 5 07 0 12 mg n g vss h to 7 2 0 15 mg n g vss h and the activity of nob was observed to decrease from 1 75 0 08 mg n g vss h to 0 42 0 03 mg n g vss h fig 3 moreover the abundance of amoa increased from 1 05 0 12 1010 copies g vss on day 44 to 1 51 0 03 1010 copies g vss on day 101 fig 4 these results suggested that by maintaining an appropriate srt and a low do concentration the activity of aob and abundance of aob amoa could be improved with the increase of mlss these conditions resulted in a nitrite accumulation ratio above 90 in 18 days which stabilized at 93 0 4 1 fig 2c during phase iii the temperature dropped from 26 c to 19 c in 14 days and the ammonium removal efficiency was decreased to 20 fig 2b although a low do concentration was adopted the nitrite accumulation ratio decreased from 92 7 to 63 4 fig 2c the aob activity decreased from 7 2 0 15 mg n g vss h to 3 8 0 29 mg n g vss h while the nob activity increased from 0 42 0 03 mg n g vss h to 0 67 0 04 mg n g vss h the abundance of amoa decreased from 1 51 0 03 1010 copies g vss to 1 37 0 10 108 copies g vss fig 4 day 145 in contrast nob abundance was less affected and was basically unchanged from 6 39 0 22 108 copies g vss to 4 25 0 26 108 copies g vss thus aob amoa abundance was sharply decreased when temperature dropped resulting in the decline of nitritation the prerequisite for achieving nitritation is the washout and suppression of nob ma et al 2016 nitrospira was the dominant nob population in the inoculated sludge whose abundance decreased from 1 02 0 05 1010 copies g vss to 6 13 0 02 107 copies g vss due to aggressive sludge discharge during temperature increase while the abundance of the nitrobacter decreased from 8 12 0 50 108 copies g vss to 4 40 0 49 108 copies g vss only the reason for this difference in abundance as shown in table 2 is that nitrobacter species have higher maximum specific growth rate μmax than nitrospira thus with aggressive sludge discharge nitrospira with lower μmax was more likely to be washed out in a low srt system resulting in a decrease in the abundance of nob eq 1 at the phase ii 59 127 d the operation mode of tapered aeration was adopted with the do concentration in the aerobic chambers o1 o2 and o3 sequentially controlled at 1 2 mg l 0 5 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively this was unfavorable for the growth of nitrobacter since they have a higher dissolved oxygen half saturation coefficient table 2 therefore ultra low sludge retention time 4 4 3 days and do control made a great contribution to eliminate nob nitrobacter and nitrospira and achieve stable nitritation 1 d x nob x nob d t μ nob 1 srtnob b nob 3 3 the recurrence of nitritation during phase iv the effect of temperature rise on the start up of nitritation was investigated the temperature increased from 20 c to 26 c in 18 days and finally stabilized at 26 1 c at this time the sludge concentration was observed to increase to 4500 5000 mg l and the activities of aob and nob were only 0 28 0 05 mg n g vss h and 0 21 0 01 mg n g vss h respectively fig 3 day 174 meanwhile the abundance of aob amoa was not increased 1 95 0 08 108 copies g vss and was lower than that of nob 5 31 0 24 108 copies g vss it should be noted that during this temperature increase period the sludge discharge amount was less than that in phase i and phase ii these results suggest that raising the temperature can fail to start up nitritation if srt is inappropriate it also may explain why nitrite accumulation occurs only rarely during the operation of actual wwtps during phase v the srt was decreased from 6 days to 4 3 days by increasing excess sludge discharge the mlss was observed to decrease from 4700 mg l to 3200 mg l fig 2 b and the ammonium removal efficiency increased from 11 2 to 52 6 in 10 days the abundance of amoa increased from 1 95 0 08 108 copies g vss to 1 09 0 10 109 copies g vss day 200 and the abundance of nob decreased from 5 31 0 24 108 copies g vss to 2 24 0 09 108 copies g vss aob activity was 7 15 0 16 mg n g vss h which was much higher than nob activity 0 68 0 08 mg n g vss h therefore nitritation was observed to resume and the nitrite accumulation ratio stabilized at 90 7 this indicated that the increase in temperature coupled with low srt can quickly and stably achieve nitritation summarizing the decrease in mlss under the ultra low srt might be an important factor in achieving nitritation 3 4 microbial community analysis of the ultra low sludge retention time system to better understand the impact of microbial community differences on nitrifying bacteria high throughput sequencing was employed to investigate the sludge samples on day 0 inoculated sludge and day 98 steady phase nitrosomonas 0 19 and nitrospira 2 40 were the sole aob and nob genus respectively in full scale aao reactor on day 0 fig 6 after introducing the control strategy of ultra low sludge retention time and tapered aeration the relative abundance of nitrosomonas increased from 0 19 to 0 79 in addition nitrosospira which is aob was also detected with a relative abundance of 0 06 whereas nitrospira was gradually washed out of the system from 2 4 relative abundance to below detection level fig 6 it is also to be noted that nitrotoga was detected in the reactor as a nob which has unusual tolerance to extreme environmental conditions zheng et al 2021 with a relative abundance of 0 073 the dominant genus top 20 observed on day 98 of the reactor operation are presented in fig s1 among these various genera of heterotrophic bacteria possessing biological phosphorus removal abilities were detected in the an o reactor with an ultra low sludge retention time the paos affiliated with genera candidatus accumulibacter tetrasphaera halomonas candidatus microthrix and pseudomonas were identified with abundances of 3 38 1 25 0 61 0 30 and 0 01 respectively wang et al 2019b fig 6 day 98 additionally gaos were also detected in the an o reactor such as dechloromonas 3 91 candidatus competibacter 3 49 and defluviicoccu 0 069 ji et al 2018 wang et al 2008 fig 6 day 98 compared with day 0 the relative abundance of paos and gaos increased from 2 51 and 4 05 to 5 55 and 7 48 respectively on day 98 fig 6 the paos and gaos are the type of facultative bacteria most of which could transform carbon sources into phas anaerobically and use them for aerobic growth ji et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 b the organic substances are preferentially used by paos and gaos in the anaerobic chamber and stored in the form of phas these accumulated phas can be utilized by paos and gaos for respiratory metabolism even though the cod in the aerobic chamber was less than 45 mg l this strengthens the competition for do in the aerobic zone with aob having a competitive advantage over nob under oxygen limited conditions picioreanu et al 1997 additionally the genera involved in endogenous denitrification such as denitratisoma 3 91 and candidatus competibacter 3 49 may contribute to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification thus inhibiting nob ji et al 2020 the results of high throughput sequencing indicated that the enrichment of endogenous heterotrophic bacteria paos and gaos may be an important reason for the achievement of nitritation in the current study 3 5 application prospects this study demonstrated that aggressively discharging excess sludge during the temperature increase period could rapidly initiate nitritation in a continuous flow an o reactor for the treatment of actual municipal wastewater also the stable maintenance of nitritation could be achieved by controlling do and adjusting srt in this way the re occurrence of sewage nitritation could be achieved during a specific period every year it is worth noting that the ultra low sludge retention time control strategy can achieve continuous system nitritation within 15 days by controlling excess sludge discharge without the addition of any chemical agents in addition the average effluent phosphorus and cod concentration of 0 96 and 43 1 mg l were observed fig 2 d thus biological phosphorus removal can be simultaneously achieved in the an o continuous flow system with an ultra low sludge retention time of 4 4 3 days fig 5 day 101 therefore seasonal nitritation can be achieved even with temperature changes without affecting the phosphorus removal effect of the system which can be easily applied in actual projects for future studies the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus may be achieved by further connection to an autotrophic nitrogen removal system the large amount of excess sludge produced by the ultra low srt system could be used for anaerobic digestion to achieve energy and phosphorus recovery this potential application requires more research since it is the key to the transformation of wastewater treatment plants from energy intensive to energy self sufficient 4 conclusions this study investigated the feasibility of the rapid start up and stable maintenance of nitritation in the continuous flow anaerobic oxic process via the ul srt the primary conclusions are 1 nitritation could be rapidly initiated within 15 days by using the ul srt and controlling the do at a high level 2 4 mg l during seasonal warming 2 the combination of the ul srt 4 4 3 days and tapered aeration was found to be a suitable method to establish stable nitritation the ul srt was key for achieving nitritation in the continuous flow an o system to treat actual municipal wastewater under tapered aeration conditions 3 by taking advantage of the differences between the specific growth rates and substrate affinities of nitrobacter and nitrospira the ul srt and do control can be used to wash out nitrospira with a lower specific growth rate and inhibit the nitrobacter with lower oxygen affinity 4 in the ul srt system the decrease of temperature causes the abundance of aob amoa to decrease rapidly which adversely impacts the stability of nitritation thus further research is required to research long term stable nitritation in the an o reactor with ul srt under low temperature conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17051,new sars cov 2 mutations are constantly emerging raising concerns of increased transmissibility virulence or escape from host immune response we describe a nested rt pcr assay 1500 bps to detect multiple nucleotide changes resulting in key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating sars cov 2 variants including the three variants of concern vocs 20i 501y v1 united kingdom 20h 501y v2 south africa and 20 j 501y v3 brazil as well as the 20e eu1 variant spain the cal 20c recently identified in california and the mink associated variant gr lineage b 1 1 298 prior to application to field samples the discriminatory potential of this pcr assay was explored using gisaid and nextclade to extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage where the amplification of long fragments is problematic two short nested rt pcr assays 300 bps were also designed targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay the three newly designed assays were then tested on field samples including 31 clinical samples 7 fully sequenced swab samples and 24 uncharacterized ones and 34 urban wastewater samples some of which collected in areas where circulation of vocs had been reported the long assay successfully amplified 29 of the 31 swabs 93 allowing the correct identification of variants 20i 501y v1 and 20e eu1 present in the panel of previously characterized samples the spanish variant was detected in 14 24 of the uncharacterized samples as well the sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay mutations characteristic of vocs uk and brazilian variant and of other variant spanish were detected in sewage samples to our knowledge this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20i 501y v1 and 20 j 501y v3 in urban wastewaters highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore sars cov 2 diversity the developed nested rt pcr assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest this can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens the assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost effective detection of vocs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater based epidemiology the approach proposed here can be used to better understand sars cov 2 variant diversity geographic distribution and impact worldwide graphycal abstract image graphical

multiple californian counties and has been responsible for several large covid 19 outbreaks in that state all of these variants have characteristic mutations the most significant of which are located in the gene encoding the spike s protein li et al 2020 pillay 2020 the so called uk variant 20i 501y v1 is characterized by 23 mutations 14 nonsynonymous mutations 3 deletions and 6 synonymous mutations affecting orf1ab s orf8 and n phe 2021 mutations in the gene that encodes for the s protein which is associated with viral entry into cells has attracted the most attention ten mutations are documented in the s protein of the uk variant two of these the n501y an asparagine to tyrosine amino acid substitution in the receptor binding domain and the hv69 70del a 6 base deletion had already been circulating globally before merging into this new variant the most relevant changes in the 20i 501y v1 variant are likely to be the n501y amino acid substitution and the y144del a deletion potentially contributing to spike surface variation the n501y amino acid substitution is in the receptor binding domain rdb important to ace2 binding and antibody recognition it is likely to enhance the transmissibility of the virus by improving the s protein s affinity for the host s ace2 receptor in vitro starr et al 2020 and animal experiments gu et al 2020 seem to confirm this hypothesis the 20h 501y v2 variant first detected in south africa displays the same n501y amino acid substitution as well as the d614g as the uk variant but this mutation is thought to have arisen independently in the two lineages who 2020b it also carries additional amino acid substitutions the most common are l18f k417n e484k and k417n in the s protein which are not usually present in the uk strain though amino acid substitution e484k has been recently detected in 21 b1 1 7 sequences in uk phe 2021 furthermore 501y v2 does not have the hv69 70del characterizing the uk variant but presents in about 85 of sequences another deletion in the s region that of amino acids 242 to 244 lal242 244del the new variant from brazil 20 j 501y v3 harbors 12 mutations in the s protein some of which it shares with either the uk variant n501y and d614g or the south african variant l18f e484k n501y d614g the spanish variant 20e eu1 is characterized by substitution a222v in the a domain of the s protein a domain which is not considered to contribute directly to receptor binding or membrane fusion for sars cov 2 hodcroft et al 2020 the rapid emergence of variants worldwide highlights the importance of genetic surveillance of the sars cov 2 pandemic the risk of introduction and community spread of variants of concern in the eu eea countries is considered very high ecdc 2021b who advises all countries to increase the routine sequencing of sars cov 2 viruses where possible and to share sequence data internationally through open source platforms who 2021 ecdc also recommends urgent analysis and sequencing of virus isolates to identify cases of the new variants in a timely manner ecdc 2021a currently whole genome sequencing wgs of human isolates has resulted in over 591 000 complete genomes available in gisaid as of 23 february 2021 a full genome approach wgs however is time consuming and costly and requires specialized computational infrastructure and technical skills furthermore wgs cannot be effectively performed in conditions of low virus titres reduced sequence integrity and simultaneous occurrence of more than one genome we developed a long pcr nested rt pcr assay 1500 bp followed by conventional sanger sequencing to quickly screen for the different circulating variants or detect the introduction of possible novel variants the assay amplifies a key region of the s gene the region containing the major mutations of the uk south african and brazilian variants as well as crucial mutations of other variants of clinical interest like the 20e eu1 that emerged in spain the mink associated variant and the cal 20c variant identified in california see table 1 preliminary studies on sequences available in gisaid and nextclade were performed before application on field samples the first aimed at verifying whether specific mutation combinations are sufficiently informative to screen for specific sars cov 2 variants and the second a comparative study of full length sequences and their corresponding 1500 bp fragments to ascertain whether the different variants would be correctly assigned to their respective clades on the sole basis of the genome region amplified by the long nested pcr assay we subsequently enhanced our method to allow variant detection in highly challenging matrices such as wastewater where the amplification of long rna fragments is difficult by designing two additional short nested rt pcrs targeting portions of the region spanned by the long assay sars cov 2 is excreted by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals that are infected with the novel coronavirus and ends up in wastewater systems foladori et al 2020 by analysing wastewater it is therefore possible to obtain information on viruses circulating in the population served by a given wastewater treatment plant wtp previous studies have detected sars cov 2 rna in wastewater samples worldwide highlighting environmental surveillance as a valuable tool potentially allowing us to detect peaks in virus circulation and estimate the proportion of individuals infected with sars cov 2 in a given catchment area hart and halden 2020 thus contributing to inform public health interventions all the assays were successfully tested on a 20i 501y v1 strain detected in italy at the end of december 2020 see supplementary material and on a wuhan strain clade 19a finally the three assays were tested on a panel of field samples of clinical swabs and environmental sewage origin the methods proposed could be used to perform targeted sequencing of clinical and environmental samples for screening and early detection of sars cov 2 variants 2 materials and methods 2 1 primer design and preliminary in silico studies primers were designed to capture key mutations of different variants such mutations table 1 potentially affecting viral infectivity and antigenicity are located in the gene encoding the spike s protein primers table 2 and fig 1 were designed using the primer 3 software http www bioinformatics nl cgi bin primer3plus primer3plus cgi ultimately three assays were designed with different aims a a long nested rt pcr first cycle pcr id 979 nested assay pcr id 980 1583 1592 bps designed to screen for the presence of mutations characteristic of the three vocs 20i 501y v1 20h 501y v2 and 20 j 501y v3 as well as other variants of interest such as 20e eu1 cal 20c and mink variant as shown in table 1 b a short nested rt pcr 319 327 bps amplifying a portion of the region targeted by the long assay first cycle pcr id 972 nested assay pcr id 973 designed to reveal the presence of the mutations hv69 70del and y144del uk variant d80a south african variant and d138y brazilian variant c another short nested rt pcr 323 bps amplifying a different portion of the region targeted by the long assay first cycle pcr id 974 hemi nested assay pcr id 975 designed to reveal the presence of the key amino acid substitution n501y shared by different vocs which is combined with substitution a570d in the 20i 501y v1 variant and with e484k in both the 20h 501y v2 and 20 j 501y v3 variants before application to field samples a preliminary in silico study was performed to examine the discriminatory potential of the specific mutations covered by our long assay for sars cov 2 variant identification this was done using gisaid https www gisaid org and nextclade https nextstrain org the gisaid study was performed on 20i 501y v1 14 january 2021 and on 20h 501y v2 17 january 2021 using complete genomes see supplementary materials overall considering the characteristic mutations of 20i 501y v1 present in the 1500 bp fragment of the s gene chosen for the long assay hv69 70del y144del n501y and a570d the results showed that among the complete genomes belonging to lineage gr b 1 1 7 any combination of two mutations was present at a frequency ranging from 97 6 to 99 4 furthermore cluster analysis attributed all of the full genomes displaying at least two of the aforementioned mutations to the gr b 1 1 7 lineage as for the 20h 501y v2 variant characteristic mutations such as d80a e484k n501y lal242 244del were present in complete genomes at a frequency ranging from 88 6 to 91 4 any combination of two of these mutations was present in clade gh lineage b 1 351 at a frequency exceeding 84 2 and sequences displaying at least two of the mutations belonged to lineage b 1 351 in 99 of cases one significant exception was the e484k n501y combination which belonged to lineage gh b 1 351 in 96 8 of cases due to its presence in the 20 j 501y v3 brazilian variant as well based on this preliminary analysis it was concluded that for these two variants the detection of a combination of at least two mutations in the selected 1500 bp fragment provided a strong indication of the presence of the variant in question to further explore the discriminatory potential of our newly designed long nested pcr for the different sars cov 2 variants we compared the 1500 bp fragments to their corresponding full length sequences in terms of how they would be classified by nextclade web tool we therefore created two fasta files one containing 30 full length genomes comprising five gisaid strains for each of the following clades variants 19a wuhan china 20i 501y v1 uk 20h 501y v2 south africa 20 j 501y v3 brazil 20e eu1 spain cal 20c california as described in the supplementary materials and the other derived from the first containing the corresponding 1500 bp fragments amplified by our long nested pcr assay both files were then analyzed using the nextclade web tool nextstrain org in order to determine whether our nested assay pcr id 980 would yield similar results to those given by a full sequence analysis nextclade web tool assigned all the variants correctly on the sole basis of the genome region amplified by the pcr id 980 the only significant exception was the 20i 501y v1 variant which was incorrectly assigned to clade 20b this misclassification however was due to a limitation of the nextclade web tool which for the purposes of phylogenetic placement and clade assignment uses only mutations and no gaps https github com nextstrain nextclade issues 311 issuecomment 765904855 and was therefore unable to take into consideration the deletions hv69 70del and y144del for a correct assignment of our partial sequences of the s gene similarly the two trees built with nextclade one based on full length genomes and the other based on 1500 bp fragments both correctly assigned all of the variants to the branches corresponding to clades 19a 20h 501y v2 20 j 501y v3 and 20e eu1 only the uk variant was placed at the base of the 20i 501y v1 branch fig 2 2 2 primer validation on field samples and assay

methodology of this research created with coggle https coggle it flowcharts is available in fig 3 3 results 3 1 primer validation and assay specificity all three newly designed pcr assays successfully amplified the uk variant and the wuhan prototype strain used for primer assessment sanger sequencing of the amplicon of the long fragment of the uk variant revealed the presence of mutations hv69 70del y144del n501y and a570d characteristic of 20i 501y v1 table 1 sequencing of the short amplicons obtained using the other two assays confirmed this result in the nextclade tree constructed using the 1500 bps sequence this isolate fell at the base of the branch corresponding to clade 20i 501y v1 as predicted by the preliminary study we conducted with the uk variant in nextrain prior to primer design fig 2 as for the wuhan sequence although amplification was achieved with all three assays the long pcr yielded a low amount of product probably due to rna fragmentation allowing only partial sequencing of the fragment identity with genbank reference sequence nc 045512 was confirmed for amplicons provided by the two short assays specificity of the three designed assays was confirmed on the evag coronavirus rna panel amplicons of the expected size were obtained only for sars cov 2 sequencing confirmed 100 identity to reference sequence nc 045512 while no amplification was present for hcov nl63 hcov 229e hcov oc43 mers cov and sars cov rnas 3 2 clinical samples all of the seven sars cov 2 rnas extracted from viruses cultured on vero e6 cells and previously characterized by wgs were successfully amplified by the three newly developed assays sequencing results of amplicons generated by the long pcr are summarized in table 3 the geographic and temporal occurrence of the mutations detected in the field samples obtained using the gisaid covsurver mutation analysis tool is summarized in supplementary materials sequences obtained by the long pcr confirmed the presence of the two variants in swab samples 20e eu1 in swab ids 29 and 30 and 20i 501y v1 in swab id 31 the uk variant however could only be assigned to its correct lineage using the gisaid blast tool given the aforementioned limitation of the nextclade tool samples free of mutations or carrying mutations not specific to any voc in the analyzed region swab ids 25 to 28 could not be differentiated and assigned indeed they showed 100 nt identity with different clades lineages in gisaid and were all classified as 19a by nextclade table 3 twenty two of the 24 sars cov 2 positive nasopharyngeal swabs for which genome characterization was not available were successfully amplified by the long nested assay the swabs which failed to be amplified were those with the lowest viral concentrations below 71 g c μl of rna of these 22 uncharacterized swabs 14 harbored the nucleotide change responsible for the a222v amino acid substitution characteristic of the spanish variant in one swab id 18 this amino acid substitution was associated with two more amino acid changes a262s and p272l occurring in 1 17 and 0 87 respectively of all sequences deposited in gisaid in another swab id 24 a222v was associated with a rare amino acid substitution a411s 0 01 occurrence no other variants of clinical interest were found in the uncharacterized samples although other mutations were detected occasionally e g s477n in swab ids 2 3 13 16 23 s98f in swab 19 d215h in swab 26 all clinical samples tested positive using the two short nested pcr assays amplicon sequencing of the short pcr fragments confirmed the sequences obtained using the long nested pcr in all samples the two swab samples ids 21 and 22 which could not be amplified by the long nested pcr were also successfully amplified and sequenced with both of the short nested assays since no mutations were found in the two regions however these samples could not be reliably classified 3 3 environmental samples a total of 34 wastewater samples were tested with the three nested pcr assays all pcr positive and negative controls gave the expected results sequencing results are summarized in table 4 the long nested rt pcr did not amplify any of the 20 sars cov 2 positive urban sewage samples collected from wtps in rome amplification however was achieved with pcr ids 973 and 975 8 and 10 samples respectively with an overlap of 5 samples none of these samples displayed mutations indicative of vocs with regard to the 14 sewage samples collected from locations experiencing outbreaks of sars cov 2 variants the long nested pcr successfully amplified two of the eight samples collected in guardiagrele abruzzo and one of the six samples collected in perugia umbria the first two samples showed nucleotide changes corresponding to the amino acid substitution a222v characteristic of the spanish variant while the other carried the nucleotide changes responsible for amino acid substitutions characteristic of the brazilian variant a panel of five substitutions d138y r190s k417t e484k and n501y the short assays pcr id 973 and pcr id 975 successfully amplified 7 and 6 of the 14 sewage samples respectively with an overlap of 6 samples including the three samples testing positive also by the long assay sequencing of fragments obtained by pcr 973 showed no mutations in the pcr amplicons originating from guardiagrele on the contrary this short assay did find the presence of a nucleotide change corresponding to an amino acid substitution characteristic of the brazilian variant d138y in three of the six samples collected in perugia in these samples the second short assay pcr 975 showed the nucleotide changes corresponding to amino acid substitutions n501y and e484k a combination present in the brazilian and the south african variant see table 1 another sample from perugia carried nucleotide changes resulting in amino acid substitutions n501y and a570d which combined are a key signature of the uk variant 4 discussion sars cov 2 sequence diversity was initially thought to be low but an increasing number of variant sequences have since been detected indicating that new mutations are continually emerging major variants discovered thus far include the uk variant clade gr lineage b 1 1 7 the south african variant gh lineage b 1 351 the brazilian variant clade gr lineage p1 the variant from california gh b 1 429 the spanish variant the mink variant and others all these sars cov 2 variants carry characteristic mutations deletions and or missense mutations in different parts of the genome some in important regions in terms of potential clinical significance such as the gene coding for the spike protein the s gene the spike protein appears to be critical for cellular entry and allows the virus to attach to the host cell pillar 2020 which is why this protein is also a target for vaccine development and antigen testing the analysis of sars cov 2 virus genomes can complement and support strategies to reduce the burden of covid 19 who 2021 whole genome sequencing has proven to be a powerful tool capable of helping us understand outbreak transmission dynamics and spill over events and to screen for mutations with a potential impact on transmissibility pathogenicity or countermeasures e g diagnostics antiviral drugs and vaccines who 2020d for this reason the who recommends that routine sequencing of sars cov 2 viruses be increased where possible and sequence data be shared through open source platforms who 2020c the ecdc similarly encourages eu eea states to sequence at least 500 randomly selected samples each week and to prioritize samples from large outbreaks or samples collected from travellers and individuals with an infection detected 2 weeks after vaccination ecdc 2021b whole genome sequencing demands substantial investment in terms of time and financial resources however and the acquisition of sufficient high quality rna to maximize sequencing yield and the validity of sequence data in addition bioinformatic analysis necessitates high performance computational power and trained staff to address some of these problems we developed a rapid inexpensive and sensitive long nested pcr assay to detect key changes in the s protein of sars cov 2 indicative of the presence of vocs 20i 501y v1 20h 501y v2 and 20 j 501y v3 as well as of other variants of clinical interest this assay can be used as a first screening tool to select samples of interest for wgs characterization resources for genome sequencing would thus be optimized by allocating them to clinically relevant specimens the region amplified by this long assay was specially chosen to reveal key mutations distinctive of main variants as shown in table 1 the discriminatory potential of the long pcr assay was initially explored in silico using gisaid and nextclade phylogenetic trees predicted the 1500 bps sequence of the s protein to have the same discriminatory power as the entire genome in assigning sequences with the s mutations characteristic of the vocs to their corresponding clusters the ability of primer pairs to amplify sars cov 2 rna and the discriminatory power of the amplified fragments were then tested on field samples consisting of sars cov 2 positive swabs some of which had already been fully sequenced all of the clinical samples were successfully amplified with the long pcr with the exception of two samples having low viral concentrations among the fully sequenced samples the 20i 501y v1 and 20e eu1 variants were correctly identified by the long assay in the uncharacterized clinical samples the only variant of interest identified was the spanish variant it was detected in 14 of 24 samples 12 harboring only the a222v key amino acid substitution discriminating the variant one also carrying the a262s and p272l amino acid substitutions and one displaying the a411s as well since these samples were randomly selected from among those collected between august 2020 and mid january 2021 by the experimental zooprophylactic institute of apulia and basilicata for routine covid 19 testing this finding is consistent with a significant circulation of the spanish variant in italy also supported by a recent preprint article suggesting that this variant has been rapidly spreading in the lazio region of italy bartolini et al 2020 moreover judging by the number of italian sequences submitted to gisaid the 20e eu1 variant has been circulating to a considerable extent in italy 1792 sequences as of 23 february 2021 more than the uk variant 659 submitted sequences other variants of concern like the brazilian or the south african variants were not available to us as field samples indeed only one case of the south african variant had been detected in italy in a man who landed at milan s malpensa airport from africa at the end of january https www ansa it lombardia notizie 2021 02 03 a varese primo caso variante sudafricana in italia 41b99448 367c 4000 ac88 9b3ae130d839 html having downloaded the sequence gisaid epi isl 1 012 924 we verified that it harbors the spike amino acid substitutions d80a d215g l242del l244del k417n e484k and n501y all of which would have been detectable by our long pcr assay similarly only three cases of the brazilian variant had been identified and fully sequenced gisaid epi isl 875 566 to id epi isl 875 568 thus far in italy all these isolates carry the characteristic spike amino acid substitutions d138y r190s e484k k417t and n501y included in our assay once we had confirmed that the developed pcr assay could be successfully used to screen for variants in clinical samples we went on to investigate whether this assay could also be used for the screening of sars cov 2 variants in complex matrices such as urban wastewaters since the amplification of long fragments poses specific challenges in such matrices we also designed two short nested rt pcr assays targeting portions of the region spanned by the long assay to be used in case of long pcr failure a number of studies have demonstrated the added value of regular surveillance of wastewaters in combination with other indicators for the management of the pandemic and a recent document by the european commission highlights the importance of wastewater surveillance to allow screening among large population groups european commission 2021 this can help public health authorities identify where more detailed analysis is needed and speed up the detection of variants as part of an increased genomic and epidemiological surveillance a few recent papers have demonstrated that environmental surveillance can be used to study sars cov 2 diversity crits christoph and co workers sequenced sars cov 2 rna directly from sewage collected in the san francisco bay area to generate complete and near complete sars cov 2 genomes and found that the major consensus genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region moreover additional variants not found in clinical samples were identified in wastewaters suggesting that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing crits christophet al 2021 metagenomic analysis of environmental matrices is a complex task however with high operational costs and specific requirements in terms of bioinformatic skills a study by graber and collaborators published as a preprint article describes a primer extension strategy to distinguish b 1 1 7 lineage in wastewater by allele specific rt qpcr assays graber et al 2021 martin and co workers demonstrated changes in virus variant predominance during the covid 19 pandemic by tracking sars cov 2 in sewage using a nested rt pcr approach targeting five different regions of the viral genome martin et al 2020 here we adopted a similar approach but concentrated on a unique region of the sars cov 2 genome the spike protein gene which harbors several key mutations associated with known vocs and other variants of interest the newly designed assays were therefore used on sewage samples including samples collected in areas were both the uk and the brazilian variants had been documented by public health authorities as expected only three of the samples could be amplified and successfully sequenced with the long pcr assay one from umbria the others from abruzzo wastewater is indeed a complex matrix where the amplification of long fragments is seldom achieved due to the presence of inhibitors nucleic acids of different origin and fragmented target genomes often in low amounts the sequences obtained by the long assay from samples collected in january in abruzzo showed mutations characteristic of the spanish variant which was indeed the most common variant in the eu till december 2020 ecdc 2021a the sequence obtained from perugia displayed instead the mutations indicative of 20 j 501y v3 interestingly this sample was collected on 6 february 2021 from a wtp serving the outskirts of perugia including the local hospital which had reportedly been experiencing nosocomial clusters of this variant as per press releases issued by public health officials https www ansa it umbria notizie 2021 02 05 rezza in umbria variante brasiliana in cluster ospedalieri d50f6dce 9b78 443c a0d8 0d23e16058a8 html https tg24 sky it salute e benessere 2021 02 08 covid umbria as expected the two short nested rt pcr assays were more sensitive than the long one successfully amplifying about half of the tested sewage samples no mutations of interest were detected in the samples collected in rome and in guardiagrele abruzzo using the short assays as the amino acid substitution a222v characteristic of the spanish variant is not included in the short fragments conversely sequences obtained from the sewage samples collected in perugia umbria showed the presence of mutations characteristic of the uk variant one sample and of the brazilian variant three samples one of which was confirmed by the long assay both of these variants had been circulating in the area according to statements by public health authorities but no genome sequences were available at the time of the study comparing results obtained by the two nested pcrs for the same sample concordant results were obtained for the brazilian variant presence of amino acid substitution d138y in the fragment obtained by pcr 973 and substitutions e484k n501y in the amplicon of pcr 975 in contrast the sample harboring mutations of the uk variant in the region amplified by pcr 975 n501y and a570d did not show the expected mutations hv69 70del and y144del in the region amplified by pcr 973 this exposes a limit of the combined use of two short pcr assays since different sars cov 2 strains may coexist in a single sewage sample the use of separate tests may result in each of the tests amplifying a sequence belonging to a different variant however our gisaid in silico study showed the combination of the n501y and a570d amino acid substitutions to strongly suggest that the sequence carrying them belongs to lineage gr b 1 1 7 furthermore we only performed classical sanger sequencing on pcr amplicons and this approach may underestimate the existence of some possibly less common sequences our next goal is therefore to combine the protocol with ngs on pcr amplicons for a more in depth analysis of sequences as successfully applied to enteric viruses suffredini et al 2018 iaconelli et al 2017 the method can be used to discriminate the currently known sars cov 2 variants and may not be as useful with new variants possibly emerging in the future nevertheless the recently described variants from nigeria g b 1 525 and from india gh b 1 36 also have key mutations in the region targeted by the described assays a67v h69del h70del y144del e484k for g b 1 525 and n440k for gh b 1 36 data not shown confirming that this is a hot spot region for mutations to our knowledge this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20i 501y v1 and 20 j 501y v3 as well as of the spanish variant in urban wastewaters highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore sars cov 2 diversity moreover we demonstrated the potential of this approach based on nested amplification followed by conventional sanger sequencing to allow the rapid identification of specific vocs in the catchment of any given wtp to quickly identify areas where the intensification of clinical surveillance and or targeted preventive intervention is required 5 conclusions the method we propose can be used to rapidly screen sars cov 2 positive samples for vocs and other variants of clinical interest compared with wgs conventional rt pcr followed by sanger sequencing can be performed routinely at low cost and does not require specialized expertise to interpret the results through the targeting of key mutations this approach could enable the rapid screening of samples and the identification of samples to submit to wgs moreover the long nested rt pcr described here can provide significant albeit partial molecular information for samples in which low amounts or poor quality sars cov 2 rna hamper the successful application of wgs the approach can be applied to environmental samples for the purposes of sars cov 2 wastewater based epidemiology to explore the possible presence of vocs or other variants of clinical interest therefore highlighting geographical areas where an enhancement of clinical monitoring could be beneficial due to an increase in the prevalence of new sars cov2 variants with possible clinical implications monitoring the spread of different variants in the general population in a timely cost effective manner is of utmost importance the proposed method can contribute to achieve this

17051,new sars cov 2 mutations are constantly emerging raising concerns of increased transmissibility virulence or escape from host immune response we describe a nested rt pcr assay 1500 bps to detect multiple nucleotide changes resulting in key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating sars cov 2 variants including the three variants of concern vocs 20i 501y v1 united kingdom 20h 501y v2 south africa and 20 j 501y v3 brazil as well as the 20e eu1 variant spain the cal 20c recently identified in california and the mink associated variant gr lineage b 1 1 298 prior to application to field samples the discriminatory potential of this pcr assay was explored using gisaid and nextclade to extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage where the amplification of long fragments is problematic two short nested rt pcr assays 300 bps were also designed targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay the three newly designed assays were then tested on field samples including 31 clinical samples 7 fully sequenced swab samples and 24 uncharacterized ones and 34 urban wastewater samples some of which collected in areas where circulation of vocs had been reported the long assay successfully amplified 29 of the 31 swabs 93 allowing the correct identification of variants 20i 501y v1 and 20e eu1 present in the panel of previously characterized samples the spanish variant was detected in 14 24 of the uncharacterized samples as well the sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay mutations characteristic of vocs uk and brazilian variant and of other variant spanish were detected in sewage samples to our knowledge this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20i 501y v1 and 20 j 501y v3 in urban wastewaters highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore sars cov 2 diversity the developed nested rt pcr assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest this can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens the assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost effective detection of vocs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater based epidemiology the approach proposed here can be used to better understand sars cov 2 variant diversity geographic distribution and impact worldwide graphycal abstract image graphical

multiple californian counties and has been responsible for several large covid 19 outbreaks in that state all of these variants have characteristic mutations the most significant of which are located in the gene encoding the spike s protein li et al 2020 pillay 2020 the so called uk variant 20i 501y v1 is characterized by 23 mutations 14 nonsynonymous mutations 3 deletions and 6 synonymous mutations affecting orf1ab s orf8 and n phe 2021 mutations in the gene that encodes for the s protein which is associated with viral entry into cells has attracted the most attention ten mutations are documented in the s protein of the uk variant two of these the n501y an asparagine to tyrosine amino acid substitution in the receptor binding domain and the hv69 70del a 6 base deletion had already been circulating globally before merging into this new variant the most relevant changes in the 20i 501y v1 variant are likely to be the n501y amino acid substitution and the y144del a deletion potentially contributing to spike surface variation the n501y amino acid substitution is in the receptor binding domain rdb important to ace2 binding and antibody recognition it is likely to enhance the transmissibility of the virus by improving the s protein s affinity for the host s ace2 receptor in vitro starr et al 2020 and animal experiments gu et al 2020 seem to confirm this hypothesis the 20h 501y v2 variant first detected in south africa displays the same n501y amino acid substitution as well as the d614g as the uk variant but this mutation is thought to have arisen independently in the two lineages who 2020b it also carries additional amino acid substitutions the most common are l18f k417n e484k and k417n in the s protein which are not usually present in the uk strain though amino acid substitution e484k has been recently detected in 21 b1 1 7 sequences in uk phe 2021 furthermore 501y v2 does not have the hv69 70del characterizing the uk variant but presents in about 85 of sequences another deletion in the s region that of amino acids 242 to 244 lal242 244del the new variant from brazil 20 j 501y v3 harbors 12 mutations in the s protein some of which it shares with either the uk variant n501y and d614g or the south african variant l18f e484k n501y d614g the spanish variant 20e eu1 is characterized by substitution a222v in the a domain of the s protein a domain which is not considered to contribute directly to receptor binding or membrane fusion for sars cov 2 hodcroft et al 2020 the rapid emergence of variants worldwide highlights the importance of genetic surveillance of the sars cov 2 pandemic the risk of introduction and community spread of variants of concern in the eu eea countries is considered very high ecdc 2021b who advises all countries to increase the routine sequencing of sars cov 2 viruses where possible and to share sequence data internationally through open source platforms who 2021 ecdc also recommends urgent analysis and sequencing of virus isolates to identify cases of the new variants in a timely manner ecdc 2021a currently whole genome sequencing wgs of human isolates has resulted in over 591 000 complete genomes available in gisaid as of 23 february 2021 a full genome approach wgs however is time consuming and costly and requires specialized computational infrastructure and technical skills furthermore wgs cannot be effectively performed in conditions of low virus titres reduced sequence integrity and simultaneous occurrence of more than one genome we developed a long pcr nested rt pcr assay 1500 bp followed by conventional sanger sequencing to quickly screen for the different circulating variants or detect the introduction of possible novel variants the assay amplifies a key region of the s gene the region containing the major mutations of the uk south african and brazilian variants as well as crucial mutations of other variants of clinical interest like the 20e eu1 that emerged in spain the mink associated variant and the cal 20c variant identified in california see table 1 preliminary studies on sequences available in gisaid and nextclade were performed before application on field samples the first aimed at verifying whether specific mutation combinations are sufficiently informative to screen for specific sars cov 2 variants and the second a comparative study of full length sequences and their corresponding 1500 bp fragments to ascertain whether the different variants would be correctly assigned to their respective clades on the sole basis of the genome region amplified by the long nested pcr assay we subsequently enhanced our method to allow variant detection in highly challenging matrices such as wastewater where the amplification of long rna fragments is difficult by designing two additional short nested rt pcrs targeting portions of the region spanned by the long assay sars cov 2 is excreted by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals that are infected with the novel coronavirus and ends up in wastewater systems foladori et al 2020 by analysing wastewater it is therefore possible to obtain information on viruses circulating in the population served by a given wastewater treatment plant wtp previous studies have detected sars cov 2 rna in wastewater samples worldwide highlighting environmental surveillance as a valuable tool potentially allowing us to detect peaks in virus circulation and estimate the proportion of individuals infected with sars cov 2 in a given catchment area hart and halden 2020 thus contributing to inform public health interventions all the assays were successfully tested on a 20i 501y v1 strain detected in italy at the end of december 2020 see supplementary material and on a wuhan strain clade 19a finally the three assays were tested on a panel of field samples of clinical swabs and environmental sewage origin the methods proposed could be used to perform targeted sequencing of clinical and environmental samples for screening and early detection of sars cov 2 variants 2 materials and methods 2 1 primer design and preliminary in silico studies primers were designed to capture key mutations of different variants such mutations table 1 potentially affecting viral infectivity and antigenicity are located in the gene encoding the spike s protein primers table 2 and fig 1 were designed using the primer 3 software http www bioinformatics nl cgi bin primer3plus primer3plus cgi ultimately three assays were designed with different aims a a long nested rt pcr first cycle pcr id 979 nested assay pcr id 980 1583 1592 bps designed to screen for the presence of mutations characteristic of the three vocs 20i 501y v1 20h 501y v2 and 20 j 501y v3 as well as other variants of interest such as 20e eu1 cal 20c and mink variant as shown in table 1 b a short nested rt pcr 319 327 bps amplifying a portion of the region targeted by the long assay first cycle pcr id 972 nested assay pcr id 973 designed to reveal the presence of the mutations hv69 70del and y144del uk variant d80a south african variant and d138y brazilian variant c another short nested rt pcr 323 bps amplifying a different portion of the region targeted by the long assay first cycle pcr id 974 hemi nested assay pcr id 975 designed to reveal the presence of the key amino acid substitution n501y shared by different vocs which is combined with substitution a570d in the 20i 501y v1 variant and with e484k in both the 20h 501y v2 and 20 j 501y v3 variants before application to field samples a preliminary in silico study was performed to examine the discriminatory potential of the specific mutations covered by our long assay for sars cov 2 variant identification this was done using gisaid https www gisaid org and nextclade https nextstrain org the gisaid study was performed on 20i 501y v1 14 january 2021 and on 20h 501y v2 17 january 2021 using complete genomes see supplementary materials overall considering the characteristic mutations of 20i 501y v1 present in the 1500 bp fragment of the s gene chosen for the long assay hv69 70del y144del n501y and a570d the results showed that among the complete genomes belonging to lineage gr b 1 1 7 any combination of two mutations was present at a frequency ranging from 97 6 to 99 4 furthermore cluster analysis attributed all of the full genomes displaying at least two of the aforementioned mutations to the gr b 1 1 7 lineage as for the 20h 501y v2 variant characteristic mutations such as d80a e484k n501y lal242 244del were present in complete genomes at a frequency ranging from 88 6 to 91 4 any combination of two of these mutations was present in clade gh lineage b 1 351 at a frequency exceeding 84 2 and sequences displaying at least two of the mutations belonged to lineage b 1 351 in 99 of cases one significant exception was the e484k n501y combination which belonged to lineage gh b 1 351 in 96 8 of cases due to its presence in the 20 j 501y v3 brazilian variant as well based on this preliminary analysis it was concluded that for these two variants the detection of a combination of at least two mutations in the selected 1500 bp fragment provided a strong indication of the presence of the variant in question to further explore the discriminatory potential of our newly designed long nested pcr for the different sars cov 2 variants we compared the 1500 bp fragments to their corresponding full length sequences in terms of how they would be classified by nextclade web tool we therefore created two fasta files one containing 30 full length genomes comprising five gisaid strains for each of the following clades variants 19a wuhan china 20i 501y v1 uk 20h 501y v2 south africa 20 j 501y v3 brazil 20e eu1 spain cal 20c california as described in the supplementary materials and the other derived from the first containing the corresponding 1500 bp fragments amplified by our long nested pcr assay both files were then analyzed using the nextclade web tool nextstrain org in order to determine whether our nested assay pcr id 980 would yield similar results to those given by a full sequence analysis nextclade web tool assigned all the variants correctly on the sole basis of the genome region amplified by the pcr id 980 the only significant exception was the 20i 501y v1 variant which was incorrectly assigned to clade 20b this misclassification however was due to a limitation of the nextclade web tool which for the purposes of phylogenetic placement and clade assignment uses only mutations and no gaps https github com nextstrain nextclade issues 311 issuecomment 765904855 and was therefore unable to take into consideration the deletions hv69 70del and y144del for a correct assignment of our partial sequences of the s gene similarly the two trees built with nextclade one based on full length genomes and the other based on 1500 bp fragments both correctly assigned all of the variants to the branches corresponding to clades 19a 20h 501y v2 20 j 501y v3 and 20e eu1 only the uk variant was placed at the base of the 20i 501y v1 branch fig 2 2 2 primer validation on field samples and assay

these seven sars cov 2 rna samples originating from nasopharyngeal swabs had previously been extracted from viruses isolated on vero e6 cells characterized by wgs and deposited in gisaid as belonging to clades 20a 20b 20e eu1 two samples each and 20i 501y v1 one sample viral concentrations in these samples were calculated as previously described la rosa et al 2021 and found to be in excess of 106 g c μl the samples were subsequently diluted to an approximate concentration of 104 g c μl before testing by nested pcr twenty four additional rna samples originated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected in apulia and basilicata between november 23 2020 and january 18 2021 these tested positive for sars cov 2 by real time rt pcr genefinder covid 19 plus realamp kit osang healthcare anyang si

methodology of this research created with coggle https coggle it flowcharts is available in fig 3 3 results 3 1 primer validation and assay specificity all three newly designed pcr assays successfully amplified the uk variant and the wuhan prototype strain used for primer assessment sanger sequencing of the amplicon of the long fragment of the uk variant revealed the presence of mutations hv69 70del y144del n501y and a570d characteristic of 20i 501y v1 table 1 sequencing of the short amplicons obtained using the other two assays confirmed this result in the nextclade tree constructed using the 1500 bps sequence this isolate fell at the base of the branch corresponding to clade 20i 501y v1 as predicted by the preliminary study we conducted with the uk variant in nextrain prior to primer design fig 2 as for the wuhan sequence although amplification was achieved with all three assays the long pcr yielded a low amount of product probably due to rna fragmentation allowing only partial sequencing of the fragment identity with genbank reference sequence nc 045512 was confirmed for amplicons provided by the two short assays specificity of the three designed assays was confirmed on the evag coronavirus rna panel amplicons of the expected size were obtained only for sars cov 2 sequencing confirmed 100 identity to reference sequence nc 045512 while no amplification was present for hcov nl63 hcov 229e hcov oc43 mers cov and sars cov rnas 3 2 clinical samples all of the seven sars cov 2 rnas extracted from viruses cultured on vero e6 cells and previously characterized by wgs were successfully amplified by the three newly developed assays sequencing results of amplicons generated by the long pcr are summarized in table 3 the geographic and temporal occurrence of the mutations detected in the field samples obtained using the gisaid covsurver mutation analysis tool is summarized in supplementary materials sequences obtained by the long pcr confirmed the presence of the two variants in swab samples 20e eu1 in swab ids 29 and 30 and 20i 501y v1 in swab id 31 the uk variant however could only be assigned to its correct lineage using the gisaid blast tool given the aforementioned limitation of the nextclade tool samples free of mutations or carrying mutations not specific to any voc in the analyzed region swab ids 25 to 28 could not be differentiated and assigned indeed they showed 100 nt identity with different clades lineages in gisaid and were all classified as 19a by nextclade table 3 twenty two of the 24 sars cov 2 positive nasopharyngeal swabs for which genome characterization was not available were successfully amplified by the long nested assay the swabs which failed to be amplified were those with the lowest viral concentrations below 71 g c μl of rna of these 22 uncharacterized swabs 14 harbored the nucleotide change responsible for the a222v amino acid substitution characteristic of the spanish variant in one swab id 18 this amino acid substitution was associated with two more amino acid changes a262s and p272l occurring in 1 17 and 0 87 respectively of all sequences deposited in gisaid in another swab id 24 a222v was associated with a rare amino acid substitution a411s 0 01 occurrence no other variants of clinical interest were found in the uncharacterized samples although other mutations were detected occasionally e g s477n in swab ids 2 3 13 16 23 s98f in swab 19 d215h in swab 26 all clinical samples tested positive using the two short nested pcr assays amplicon sequencing of the short pcr fragments confirmed the sequences obtained using the long nested pcr in all samples the two swab samples ids 21 and 22 which could not be amplified by the long nested pcr were also successfully amplified and sequenced with both of the short nested assays since no mutations were found in the two regions however these samples could not be reliably classified 3 3 environmental samples a total of 34 wastewater samples were tested with the three nested pcr assays all pcr positive and negative controls gave the expected results sequencing results are summarized in table 4 the long nested rt pcr did not amplify any of the 20 sars cov 2 positive urban sewage samples collected from wtps in rome amplification however was achieved with pcr ids 973 and 975 8 and 10 samples respectively with an overlap of 5 samples none of these samples displayed mutations indicative of vocs with regard to the 14 sewage samples collected from locations experiencing outbreaks of sars cov 2 variants the long nested pcr successfully amplified two of the eight samples collected in guardiagrele abruzzo and one of the six samples collected in perugia umbria the first two samples showed nucleotide changes corresponding to the amino acid substitution a222v characteristic of the spanish variant while the other carried the nucleotide changes responsible for amino acid substitutions characteristic of the brazilian variant a panel of five substitutions d138y r190s k417t e484k and n501y the short assays pcr id 973 and pcr id 975 successfully amplified 7 and 6 of the 14 sewage samples respectively with an overlap of 6 samples including the three samples testing positive also by the long assay sequencing of fragments obtained by pcr 973 showed no mutations in the pcr amplicons originating from guardiagrele on the contrary this short assay did find the presence of a nucleotide change corresponding to an amino acid substitution characteristic of the brazilian variant d138y in three of the six samples collected in perugia in these samples the second short assay pcr 975 showed the nucleotide changes corresponding to amino acid substitutions n501y and e484k a combination present in the brazilian and the south african variant see table 1 another sample from perugia carried nucleotide changes resulting in amino acid substitutions n501y and a570d which combined are a key signature of the uk variant 4 discussion sars cov 2 sequence diversity was initially thought to be low but an increasing number of variant sequences have since been detected indicating that new mutations are continually emerging major variants discovered thus far include the uk variant clade gr lineage b 1 1 7 the south african variant gh lineage b 1 351 the brazilian variant clade gr lineage p1 the variant from california gh b 1 429 the spanish variant the mink variant and others all these sars cov 2 variants carry characteristic mutations deletions and or missense mutations in different parts of the genome some in important regions in terms of potential clinical significance such as the gene coding for the spike protein the s gene the spike protein appears to be critical for cellular entry and allows the virus to attach to the host cell pillar 2020 which is why this protein is also a target for vaccine development and antigen testing the analysis of sars cov 2 virus genomes can complement and support strategies to reduce the burden of covid 19 who 2021 whole genome sequencing has proven to be a powerful tool capable of helping us understand outbreak transmission dynamics and spill over events and to screen for mutations with a potential impact on transmissibility pathogenicity or countermeasures e g diagnostics antiviral drugs and vaccines who 2020d for this reason the who recommends that routine sequencing of sars cov 2 viruses be increased where possible and sequence data be shared through open source platforms who 2020c the ecdc similarly encourages eu eea states to sequence at least 500 randomly selected samples each week and to prioritize samples from large outbreaks or samples collected from travellers and individuals with an infection detected 2 weeks after vaccination ecdc 2021b whole genome sequencing demands substantial investment in terms of time and financial resources however and the acquisition of sufficient high quality rna to maximize sequencing yield and the validity of sequence data in addition bioinformatic analysis necessitates high performance computational power and trained staff to address some of these problems we developed a rapid inexpensive and sensitive long nested pcr assay to detect key changes in the s protein of sars cov 2 indicative of the presence of vocs 20i 501y v1 20h 501y v2 and 20 j 501y v3 as well as of other variants of clinical interest this assay can be used as a first screening tool to select samples of interest for wgs characterization resources for genome sequencing would thus be optimized by allocating them to clinically relevant specimens the region amplified by this long assay was specially chosen to reveal key mutations distinctive of main variants as shown in table 1 the discriminatory potential of the long pcr assay was initially explored in silico using gisaid and nextclade phylogenetic trees predicted the 1500 bps sequence of the s protein to have the same discriminatory power as the entire genome in assigning sequences with the s mutations characteristic of the vocs to their corresponding clusters the ability of primer pairs to amplify sars cov 2 rna and the discriminatory power of the amplified fragments were then tested on field samples consisting of sars cov 2 positive swabs some of which had already been fully sequenced all of the clinical samples were successfully amplified with the long pcr with the exception of two samples having low viral concentrations among the fully sequenced samples the 20i 501y v1 and 20e eu1 variants were correctly identified by the long assay in the uncharacterized clinical samples the only variant of interest identified was the spanish variant it was detected in 14 of 24 samples 12 harboring only the a222v key amino acid substitution discriminating the variant one also carrying the a262s and p272l amino acid substitutions and one displaying the a411s as well since these samples were randomly selected from among those collected between august 2020 and mid january 2021 by the experimental zooprophylactic institute of apulia and basilicata for routine covid 19 testing this finding is consistent with a significant circulation of the spanish variant in italy also supported by a recent preprint article suggesting that this variant has been rapidly spreading in the lazio region of italy bartolini et al 2020 moreover judging by the number of italian sequences submitted to gisaid the 20e eu1 variant has been circulating to a considerable extent in italy 1792 sequences as of 23 february 2021 more than the uk variant 659 submitted sequences other variants of concern like the brazilian or the south african variants were not available to us as field samples indeed only one case of the south african variant had been detected in italy in a man who landed at milan s malpensa airport from africa at the end of january https www ansa it lombardia notizie 2021 02 03 a varese primo caso variante sudafricana in italia 41b99448 367c 4000 ac88 9b3ae130d839 html having downloaded the sequence gisaid epi isl 1 012 924 we verified that it harbors the spike amino acid substitutions d80a d215g l242del l244del k417n e484k and n501y all of which would have been detectable by our long pcr assay similarly only three cases of the brazilian variant had been identified and fully sequenced gisaid epi isl 875 566 to id epi isl 875 568 thus far in italy all these isolates carry the characteristic spike amino acid substitutions d138y r190s e484k k417t and n501y included in our assay once we had confirmed that the developed pcr assay could be successfully used to screen for variants in clinical samples we went on to investigate whether this assay could also be used for the screening of sars cov 2 variants in complex matrices such as urban wastewaters since the amplification of long fragments poses specific challenges in such matrices we also designed two short nested rt pcr assays targeting portions of the region spanned by the long assay to be used in case of long pcr failure a number of studies have demonstrated the added value of regular surveillance of wastewaters in combination with other indicators for the management of the pandemic and a recent document by the european commission highlights the importance of wastewater surveillance to allow screening among large population groups european commission 2021 this can help public health authorities identify where more detailed analysis is needed and speed up the detection of variants as part of an increased genomic and epidemiological surveillance a few recent papers have demonstrated that environmental surveillance can be used to study sars cov 2 diversity crits christoph and co workers sequenced sars cov 2 rna directly from sewage collected in the san francisco bay area to generate complete and near complete sars cov 2 genomes and found that the major consensus genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region moreover additional variants not found in clinical samples were identified in wastewaters suggesting that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing crits christophet al 2021 metagenomic analysis of environmental matrices is a complex task however with high operational costs and specific requirements in terms of bioinformatic skills a study by graber and collaborators published as a preprint article describes a primer extension strategy to distinguish b 1 1 7 lineage in wastewater by allele specific rt qpcr assays graber et al 2021 martin and co workers demonstrated changes in virus variant predominance during the covid 19 pandemic by tracking sars cov 2 in sewage using a nested rt pcr approach targeting five different regions of the viral genome martin et al 2020 here we adopted a similar approach but concentrated on a unique region of the sars cov 2 genome the spike protein gene which harbors several key mutations associated with known vocs and other variants of interest the newly designed assays were therefore used on sewage samples including samples collected in areas were both the uk and the brazilian variants had been documented by public health authorities as expected only three of the samples could be amplified and successfully sequenced with the long pcr assay one from umbria the others from abruzzo wastewater is indeed a complex matrix where the amplification of long fragments is seldom achieved due to the presence of inhibitors nucleic acids of different origin and fragmented target genomes often in low amounts the sequences obtained by the long assay from samples collected in january in abruzzo showed mutations characteristic of the spanish variant which was indeed the most common variant in the eu till december 2020 ecdc 2021a the sequence obtained from perugia displayed instead the mutations indicative of 20 j 501y v3 interestingly this sample was collected on 6 february 2021 from a wtp serving the outskirts of perugia including the local hospital which had reportedly been experiencing nosocomial clusters of this variant as per press releases issued by public health officials https www ansa it umbria notizie 2021 02 05 rezza in umbria variante brasiliana in cluster ospedalieri d50f6dce 9b78 443c a0d8 0d23e16058a8 html https tg24 sky it salute e benessere 2021 02 08 covid umbria as expected the two short nested rt pcr assays were more sensitive than the long one successfully amplifying about half of the tested sewage samples no mutations of interest were detected in the samples collected in rome and in guardiagrele abruzzo using the short assays as the amino acid substitution a222v characteristic of the spanish variant is not included in the short fragments conversely sequences obtained from the sewage samples collected in perugia umbria showed the presence of mutations characteristic of the uk variant one sample and of the brazilian variant three samples one of which was confirmed by the long assay both of these variants had been circulating in the area according to statements by public health authorities but no genome sequences were available at the time of the study comparing results obtained by the two nested pcrs for the same sample concordant results were obtained for the brazilian variant presence of amino acid substitution d138y in the fragment obtained by pcr 973 and substitutions e484k n501y in the amplicon of pcr 975 in contrast the sample harboring mutations of the uk variant in the region amplified by pcr 975 n501y and a570d did not show the expected mutations hv69 70del and y144del in the region amplified by pcr 973 this exposes a limit of the combined use of two short pcr assays since different sars cov 2 strains may coexist in a single sewage sample the use of separate tests may result in each of the tests amplifying a sequence belonging to a different variant however our gisaid in silico study showed the combination of the n501y and a570d amino acid substitutions to strongly suggest that the sequence carrying them belongs to lineage gr b 1 1 7 furthermore we only performed classical sanger sequencing on pcr amplicons and this approach may underestimate the existence of some possibly less common sequences our next goal is therefore to combine the protocol with ngs on pcr amplicons for a more in depth analysis of sequences as successfully applied to enteric viruses suffredini et al 2018 iaconelli et al 2017 the method can be used to discriminate the currently known sars cov 2 variants and may not be as useful with new variants possibly emerging in the future nevertheless the recently described variants from nigeria g b 1 525 and from india gh b 1 36 also have key mutations in the region targeted by the described assays a67v h69del h70del y144del e484k for g b 1 525 and n440k for gh b 1 36 data not shown confirming that this is a hot spot region for mutations to our knowledge this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20i 501y v1 and 20 j 501y v3 as well as of the spanish variant in urban wastewaters highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore sars cov 2 diversity moreover we demonstrated the potential of this approach based on nested amplification followed by conventional sanger sequencing to allow the rapid identification of specific vocs in the catchment of any given wtp to quickly identify areas where the intensification of clinical surveillance and or targeted preventive intervention is required 5 conclusions the method we propose can be used to rapidly screen sars cov 2 positive samples for vocs and other variants of clinical interest compared with wgs conventional rt pcr followed by sanger sequencing can be performed routinely at low cost and does not require specialized expertise to interpret the results through the targeting of key mutations this approach could enable the rapid screening of samples and the identification of samples to submit to wgs moreover the long nested rt pcr described here can provide significant albeit partial molecular information for samples in which low amounts or poor quality sars cov 2 rna hamper the successful application of wgs the approach can be applied to environmental samples for the purposes of sars cov 2 wastewater based epidemiology to explore the possible presence of vocs or other variants of clinical interest therefore highlighting geographical areas where an enhancement of clinical monitoring could be beneficial due to an increase in the prevalence of new sars cov2 variants with possible clinical implications monitoring the spread of different variants in the general population in a timely cost effective manner is of utmost importance the proposed method can contribute to achieve this

17052,the increasing frequency and intensity of blooms of toxin and taste odour producing filamentous cyanobacteria in water sources is a growing global issue compared to the common spherical microcystis genus the removal of filamentous cyanobacteria is more difficult in drinking water treatment plants hence abatement and control of the occurrence and proliferation of harmful filamentous cyanobacteria within drinking water sources is important for water supply in this study the solid sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 was used as an algaecide to eliminate the cyanobacteria distributed throughout the water column in the surface and bottom layer of a reservoir serving as a drinking water source results showed that although the oxidation capacity of spc was higher in the surface water due to the higher light intensity than in the bottom water 3 0 mg l spc can still suppress the harmful cyanobacteria in the bottom water after 36 h because the carbonate ion generated by spc decomposition can act as an activator of h2o2 to generate many reactive oxygen species including superoxide radicals carbonate radical anions and hydroxyl radicals even in the light limited environment the obtained inactivation rates for the main cyanobacteria in this reservoir followed the order pseudanabaena limnetica raphidiopsis curvata cylindrospermopsis raciborskii 3 0 mg l spc has a slight impact on microeukaryotic communities according to the 18s rrna gene sequencing while 6 0 mg l spc changed the composition of eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton clearly eukaryotic co occurrence networks showed that although the network of eukaryotic plankton in treated surface water was more compact and clustered stability of microeukaryotes in the treated surface water was lower than for the treated bottom water owing to the higher oxidation capacity of spc in the surface water the results above not only have important implications for full scale control of harmful cyanobacteria in drinking water sources especially filamentous cyanobacteria with vertical distributions but also help to ensure the health and stability of the whole aquatic ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous cyanobacteria sodium percarbonate microeukaryotic communities co occurrence network drinking water source 1 introduction eutrophication and global climate change are promoting the proliferation of harmful cyanobacterial blooms which have increasingly become a major nuisance in many marine and freshwater ecosystems brookes and carey 2011 huisman et al 2018 chapra et al 2017 projected the influence of climate change on harmful algal blooms in the united states freshwaters according to five global circulation models and found that the mean number of days with harmful cyanobacterial blooms will rise from about 7 days per year per waterbody under current conditions to 18 39 days in 2090 in the united states a high density of cyanobacterial blooms can not only block the light from reaching other phytoplankton mur et al 1999 huisman et al 2004 but also affect the growth of herbivorous zooplankton ghadouani et al 2003 wilson et al 2006 more seriously some cyanobacteria can produce toxins such as microcystins mcs and cylindrospermopsin which can cause serious and even fatal liver digestive and neurological diseases merel et al 2013 huisman et al 2018 hence the world health organization proposed a guideline limit of 1 μg l for microcystin lr one of the most common mcs in drinking water who 2008 some cyanobacteria can produce taste and odour compounds which interfere with the recreational function of lakes and the use of reservoirs for drinking water izaguirre et al 1999 niiyama et al 2016 huang et al 2018 for example the most common off flavour compounds geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib will impart a muddy or earthy musty flavour to drinking water at even 4 10 ng l cook et al 2001 hence the odour compounds threshold concentration in drinking water is 10 ng l in china mh and sac 2006 and the odour in drinking water should be less than 3 threshold odour numbers in the u s a us epa 2018 several methods of preventing cyanobacterial blooms have been suggested most chemical methods to remove harmful algae will result in the production of harmful by products or the accumulation of heavy metals such as cu in ecosystems huisman et al 2018 xu et al 2019 hence there is a clear need for an effective means of suppressing the proliferation of upcoming cyanobacterial blooms whilst also being environmentally benign because hydrogen peroxide h2o2 decomposes to water and oxygen without chemical residues it has been used as a benign chemical to decrease cyanobacteria barrington and ghadouani 2008 barrington et al 2013 besides that it is intriguing that h2o2 may have a more pronounced effect on cyanobacteria which are prokaryotic than on the eukaryotic phytoplankton whose photosynthetic apparatus are contained within discrete organelles barrington and ghadouani 2008 matthijs et al 2012 weenink et al 2015 matthijs et al 2012 studied the influence of h2o2 on the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix agardhii in lake koetshuis the netherlands and found that 2 0 mg l h2o2 could prevent the excessive multiplication of planktothrix agardhii in the surface water meanwhile there was little effect on the eukaryotic phytoplankton including green algae cryptophytes chrysophytes and diatoms zooplankton and macrofauna in recent years some filamentous cyanobacteria such as pseudanabaena sp which are important 2 mib contributing algae in many lakes and reservoirs and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii which can produce cylindrospermopsin have become the main cyanobacterial species all over the word izaguirre et al 1999 niiyama et al 2016 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018a remarkably these cyanobacteria i e pseudanabaena sp and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii can adapt to grow in low light environments the middle and bottom of a water body and are often distributed uniformly through the water column newcombe 2009 although h2o2 can inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria and degrade toxins odours in the water surface by producing reactive oxygen species under light or uv radiation barrington and ghadouani 2008 the degradation of cyanobacteria by h2o2 in middle and bottom water may be weak due to the light limitation piel et al 2020 sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 as an adduct of 32 5 h2o2 and 67 5 na2co3 by mass has recently attracted researchers attention greenfield et al 2014 ma et al 2018 from a practical point of view as it is a solid reagent spc is more convenient to handle and deliver than h2o2 additionally spc is also relatively stable in underground environments compared to h2o2 most importantly the carbonate ion can act as an activator of h2o2 to generate many reactive oxygen species including superoxide radicals carbonate radical anions and hydroxyl radicals even in a light limited environment as shown in eqs 1 6 li et al 2018b hence it is possible to use spc to control the harmful algae in bottom water however to the best of our knowledge there is no research on the effect of spc on cyanobacteria especially the filamentous cyanobacteria in the bottom layer of a lake or reservoir 1 h 2 o 2 co 3 2 ho 2 hco 3 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 ho 2 oh o h 3 ho 2 o

though several researchers have investigated the effect of h2o2 on eukaryotic phytoplankton by microscopic observation barrington and ghadouani 2008 matthijs et al 2012 analyses of eukaryotic plankton communities were mainly limited to some abundant taxa because of past methodological limitations a recent revolution in high throughput and deep sequencing is now allowing a much more direct identification of the rare taxa in a given environment pedrós alió 2012 chen et al 2019 which may be beneficial to the study of the effect of oxidation on the whole eukaryotic community hence the aims of this study were twofold 1 investigation of the effect of spc on the filamentous cyanobacteria including whether spc can efficiently suppress the growth of filamentous species is the oxidation effect of spc on cyanobacteria similar in different water layers do the various species of filamentous cyanobacteria have the same response to spc 2 explication of whether the spc kills the eukaryotic microbiomes or restrains their growth including whether the main kinds of eukaryote meet the same fate after contact with spc in the water body would eukaryotic microbiomes remain stable at a favourable level if this technique were used to control the filamentous cyanobacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the raw bloom water containing pseudanabaena limnetica and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was sampled in august 2019 from the xiashan reservoir 119 21 119 31 e 36 16 36 31 n an important drinking water source in weifang city shandong province china with a

raw surface bloom water table s1 were analysed all of the parameters were compared across treatments with one way anova using the spss software version 16 0 and the significance was set to p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of spc on algae in the surface and bottom bloom water cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms accounted for the main species found in the surface and bottom bloom water and the total biovolumes of algae were also similar figure s1 cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the surface water accounted for 35 6 11 8 and 52 2 of the total algal biovolume respectively whilst the proportion of cyanobacterial biovolume 45 9 in bottom water was higher than that in the surface water p 0 01 and the green algae s proportion 5 0 in bottom water was lower than that in surface water p 0 01 cyanobacteria were mainly made up of pseudanabaena limnetica cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and raphidiopsis curvata of which pseudanabaena limnetica was predominant in xiashan reservoir in the present study liu et al 2019 reported that the principal cyanobacteria in shidou reservoir were cylindrospermopsis raciborskii raphidiopsis sp and pseudanabaena sp of these cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was the most abundant specie the difference above may be attributed to the fact that shidou reservoir is a subtropical reservoir which would be beneficial to the growth of cylindrospermopsis raciborskii li et al 2018a while xiashan reservoir is a temperate reservoir fragilaria capucina and synedra acusvar were the main species amongst the diatoms in the surface and bottom water samples the green algae mainly comprised chlorella vulgaris chlorella pyrenoidosa and chlorella ellipsoidea in the surface and bottom water changes in the densities of total algae cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the surface and bottom water samples after treatment with different doses of spc 3 0 and 6 0 mg l are shown in fig 1 the densities of total algae and cyanobacteria declined rapidly especially when the spc dose was 6 0 mg l however there was a slight decrease in the green algae and diatoms concentrations after oxidation for 36 h especially when the spc dose was 3 0 mg l the results above mean that cyanobacteria were more sensitive to spc compared with green algae and diatoms which was similar to the study of matthijs et al 2012 who found that the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix agardhii could be controlled effectively when 2 0 mg l h2o2 was added while there were no major impacts on green algae or diatoms it was reported that h2o2 could be produced by the mehler reaction in eukaryotic phytoplankton and higher plants when exposed to high light intensity asada 2006 however the mehler reaction does not produce h2o2 or other reactive oxygen species in cyanobacteria latifi et al 2009 allahverdiyeva et al 2011 hence the higher sensitivity of prokaryotic cyanobacteria to spc compared with the eukaryotic green algae and diatoms may be due to the lower anti oxidation capability in cyanobacterial cells furthermore the cell walls of eukaryotic green algae and diatoms are thicker than prokaryotic cyanobacteria hoiczyk and hansel 2000 hence green algae and diatoms have stronger antioxidant capacity to resist the effect of spc furthermore it was found that the reduction in cell numbers was higher in surface water than that in bottom water and the extracellular doc level in the bottom water was lower than that in the surface water figure s2 implying that the oxidation capacity of spc was higher in the surface water this may be attributed to the higher intensity of simulated sunlight especially the uv part in surface water which accelerated the reaction of h2o2 with co3 2 and the ensuing decomposition of h2o2 see figure s3 ma et al 2018 3 2 kinetics of algal cell lysis in the surface and bottom bloom water huo et al 2015 and xu et al 2019 reported that the delayed chick watson model was suitable to calculate cell lysis rates of algae after h2o2 treatment and a lag phase was found between the addition of h2o2 and the membrane rupture of algal cells the lag phase was also observed for oxidation of microcystis aeruginosa cells by k2feo4 and chlorination fan et al 2016 2018 hence the delayed chick watson model proposed by huo et al 2015 was applied to estimate cell lysis rates for the spc treatment as

oxidant concentration ct m s is oxidant exposure value ct lag m s is the lag phase ct and k m 1 s 1 is the rate constant at which lysis occurs the lysis rate of algae increased when the dose of spc rose from 3 0 mg l to 6 0 mg l fig 2 furthermore it was found that the lysis rates of cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the surface water were higher than those in the bottom water with the 6 0 mg l spc p 0 05 the reason may be due to the higher light intensity especially the uv in the treatment of the surface bloom water which accelerate the composition of h2o2 and reactive oxygen species production xu et al 2019 it was intriguing that the lysis rate due to spc was much higher for cyanobacteria than for green algae and diatoms the latter two being similar for example the lysis rates for the three types of algae were 1 739 0 380 and 0 407 m 1 s 1 when 6 0 mg l spc was added to treat the surface water fig 2 in addition the lysis rates due to spc of pseudanabaena limnetica cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and raphidiopsis curvata which are cyanobacteria were also studied table 1 and figure s4 we also found that the lysis rates for pseudanabaena limnetica cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and raphidiopsis curvata grew with an increase in the spc dose from 3 0 to 6 0 mg l and their lysis rates were faster in surface water than in bottom water when 6 0 mg l spc added p 0 05 interestingly the obtained inactivation rates for these three kinds of cyanobacteria followed the order pseudanabaena limnetica raphidiopsis curvata cylindrospermopsis raciborskii their sensitivity to spc may be related to their morphology and other characteristics for example it was reported that the cell wall thicknesses of pseudanabaena limnetica and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were about 40 and 56 nm respectively sorokovikova et al 2008 wejnerowski et al 2018 in our previous study the lysis rate of pseudanabaena galeata due to h2o2 was 2 72 m 1 s 1 when the initial concentration of h2o2 was 3 0 mg l under sunlight xu et al 2019 correspondingly the lysis rate of pseudanabaena limnetica due to spc was 2 08 m 1 s 1 with 6 0 mg l spc equating to 2 0 mg l h2o2 under simulated sunlight in the surface layer although the carbonate ion which is generated by the decomposition of spc can act as an activator of h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species the lower lysis rate of pseudanabaena limnetica in the presence of spc may be due to the following reasons 1 the light in the surface layer is 150 μmol photons m 2s 1 which was lower than that in our previous study 460 μmol photons m 2s 1 2 the initial concentration of pseudanabaena limnetica in surface bloom water was 8 1 104 cells ml which was higher than that in our previous study 6 0 104 cells ml 3 the water matrix was different such as tn in the surface bloom water 1 23 mg l was obviously higher than our previous study 0 132 mg l and 4 there was only pseudanabaena limnetica in the bloom water of xu s study whereas green algae diatoms and other species of cyanobacteria were included in the surface bloom water and pseudanabaena limnetica only accounting for 15 9 of total algal biovolume the competition of them with pseudanabaena limnetica for the oxidant chemicals will reduce lysis rate of pseudanabaena limnetica 3 3 dynamics of eukaryotic community compositions to evaluate the effect of spc on eukaryotic communities in the surface and bottom water 18s rrna genes were analysed overall the sequencing of 18s rrna genes yielded 614 107 high quality sequences and 2190 otus at 97 similarity level the chao indices in s1 and b1 were 813 and 553 respectively which indicate that the richness in surface water was markedly higher than that in bottom water it was found that the chao index declined slightly with 3 0 mg l spc for the surface water and bottom water fig 3 a and b while the chao index decreased greatly when the dose of spc was 6 0 mg l implying that the richness of the eukaryotic communities in the surface and bottom water was not changed much with 3 0 mg l spc however 6 0 mg l spc substantially changed the richness of the samples the shannon index in s1 was higher than that in b1 fig 3 c and d signifying the richer diversity in s1 compared with b1 for the surface water the shannon indices were respectively 4 62 4 68 and 4 27 after 0 6 and 18 h oxidation with 3 0 mg l spc furthermore the shannon index changed to 4 62 and 3 17 after 6 and 18 h oxidation with 6 0 mg l spc fig 3 c these results suggest that although the diversity was decreased slightly with 3 0 mg l spc for the surface water the diversity declined noticeably following oxidation by 6 0 mg l spc for 18 h interestingly the shannon index for the bottom water was practically unchanged with different spc doses and reaction times the reason should be the weaker oxidation capability of spc in the bottom water triplicate relative abundances of annotated contiguous eukaryote sequences of s1 s1 1 s1 2 and s1 3 are compared and shown in figure s5 it is both qualitatively and quantitatively evident from the scatter plots and line of best fit statistics that there is a high level of reproducibility i e results are non random in the high throughput sequencing data nmds was performed to evaluate the variation in eukaryotic communities after the treatment with spc fig 3 e usually the closer the plotting of two samples the more similar are their compositions firstly it is notable that the eukaryotic communities differed between s1 and b1 which was in accordance with the findings from the chao and shannon indices above secondly after the treatment of the surface water the samples were close together with the exception of s5 implying that although the composition of the eukaryotic communities changed after spc oxidation the composition was not varied dramatically except for s5 thirdly the composition of eukaryotes in bottom water treated with 3 0 mg l spc was slightly changed however eukaryotic communities did change clearly when 6 0 mg l spc was added and the oxidation time was 18 h b5 of all the total sequences 4 4 were not classified at the phylum level and eukaryotic compositions at the phylum level for each sample are shown in fig 4 the main phyla in the surface water were ciliophora cryptophyta rotifera ochrophyta and chloroplastida meanwhile gracilipodida chloroplastida ciliophora rotifera alveolata and ochrophyta were the dominant phyla in the bottom water it is intriguing that cryptophyta was the second most abundant microeukaryote in surface water whereas there was basically no cryptophyta in bottom water the reason may be attributable to the fact that the transparency of the water in xiashan reservoir was 1 4 m in august and the prevalence of cryptophyta in surface water benefitted from photosynthesis moreover it is notable that gracilipodida and alveolata were the dominant phyla in bottom water but conversely there was no gracilipodida or alveolata in surface water the predominance of gracilipodida and alveolata in bottom water may be influenced by the low temperature and high nutrient level of that environment for instance it was reported that alveolata actively grazed on microbial mats adjacent to cold seeps takishita et al 2010 in addition liu et al 2019 investigated the eukaryotic community of a subtropical reservoir by analysing the surface water during a cyanobacterial bloom and found that metazoa dinophyta cryptophyta ciliophora fungi and stramenopiles predominated although they sampled surface water during the cyanobacterial bloom the microeukaryotic communities were clearly different from ours there may be two reasons for this first of all xiashan reservoir is a temperate reservoir while the reservoir in liu s study is a subtropical reservoir eukaryotic community structure in surface water could be influenced by water quality such as water temperature and so forth secondly the predominant cyanobacterium in xiashan reservoir was pseudanabaena limnetica whereas cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was the main cyanobacterium in the reservoir of liu s study as shown in fig 4 relative abundance of chloroplastida which was composed by green algae basically accounted for microeukaryotic community was changed marginally after 3 0 mg l spc added because the green algae density was not declined obviously with 3 0 mg l spc fig 1 it can be inferred that the variation of absolute abundance for the whole microeukaryotic community was slight when 3 0 mg l spc was added in the surface and bottom water furthermore the relative abundance of ochrophyta and chloroplastida increased in the surface and bottom water after 6 0 mg l spc treatment correspondingly ciliophora and cryptophyta s relative abundance in surface water and the relative abundance of gracilipodida and alveolata in bottom water reduced greatly especially after 6 0 mg l spc teatment which suggest that ciliophora gracilipodida and alveolata which are unicellular protozoa and cryptophyta were more sensitive to spc in comparison to ochrophyta and chloroplastida fig 4 matthijs et al 2012 studied the effect of h2o2 on eukaryotic microbes and found that eukaryotic phytoplankton could thrive when the concentration of h2o2 was 2 5 mg l however the zooplankton were noticeably affected which means that the antioxidant capacity of zooplankton was weaker than the eukaryotic phytoplankton holm et al 2008 investigated the effect of high power ultrasound on the survival of phytoplankton and zooplankton and found that treatment with ultrasound was more effective in killing zooplankton than phytoplankton although cryptophyta are eukaryotic phytoplankton the rapid degradation of cryptophyta when spc was added should be due to the lack of cell walls in cryptophyta schiewer and volesky 2000 the abundance of ciliophora increased in bottom water and surface water when the oxidation time was less than 6 h however ciliophora abundance in surface water declined from 34 2 and 35 7 to 19 3 and 4 5 respectively when the oxidation time increased from 6 to 18 h with 3 0 and 6 0 mg l spc the results indicate that ciliophora can withstand low levels of oxidation potential furthermore it was found that the abundance of rotifera which are micrometazoa did not change perceptibly during the treatment process yang et al 2018 reported that rotifera have a strong antioxidation capacity and there was basically no effect on rotifera even when 6 7 mg l h2o2 was added the abundances of gracilipodida and alveolata decreased when the reaction time was prolonged and the spc dose increased implying that gracilipodida and alveolata were very sensitive to spc studies have determined that different zooplankton genera have different susceptibilities to h2o2 reichwaldt et al 2012 barrington et al 2013 implying that different genera of zooplankton have different degrees of antioxidant capacity hence the different mortalities of ciliophora rotifera gracilipodida and alveolata in response to spc may be due to their different characteristics the specific reasons for which should be studied in future eukaryotic co occurrence networks were used to investigate key eukaryotic groups and associations between otus at the phylum level for the surface and bottom bloom water treated with spc each node is an otu and eukaryotes belonging to the same phylum tended to present more associations than eukaryotes from different phyla fig 5 ciliophora and ochrophyta represented the majority of otus in the network of the treated surface bloom water followed by chloroplastida chytridiomycota and cercozoa however for the bottom water treated with spc the chloroplastida and ochrophyta nodes were the most dominant in the network followed by ciliophora cercozoa and chytridiomycota as shown in fig 5 there were 234 nodes with 3513 edges positive associations 71 3 for the treated surface bloom water but only 190 nodes with 1953 edges positive associations 71 5 for the treated bottom bloom water the network density and the network clustering coefficient were greater for the treated surface water than the treated bottom water fig 5 jeong et al 2016 reported that the higher the values of network density and network clustering coefficient the more compact and clustered of the network hence the network of the surface water treated with spc was more compact and clustered compared with the bottom water oxidated by spc douterelo et al 2020 reported that the ratio between density and clustering coefficient of the network can represent the stability of the networks and the lower this ratio the higher the stability of the network the ratio between density d and clustering coefficient transitivity t in the network of the treated surface water d 0 129 t 0 684 d t 0 189 was higher than that of the treated bottom water d 0 109 t 0 612 d t 0 178 which means the stability of the treated surface water was lower than that of the bottom water resilience refers to the capacity of an ecosystem to recover from a perturbation by the rapid recovery of the eukaryotic community without ending in a different state kim et al 2018 the higher stability of the eukaryotes in treated bottom water means they will be more resilient to perturbations e g change in hydraulic regime temperature etc although the network of the treated surface water was more compact and clustered the more fragile communities may be associated with the higher oxidation capacity of spc in the surface water and with a susceptible composition of the microeukaryotes for instance cryptophyta which was very sensitive to spc and was the second most abundant microeukaryote in surface water conversely practically no cryptophyta was found in bottom water 3 4 operational applications and recommendations compared with h2o2 which is viewed as an environmentally friendly alternative algaecide barrington and ghadouani 2008 barrington et al 2013 the solid and stable spc is more convenient to use in reservoirs and lakes the normalized prices per metric ton of h2o2 are 300 350 for spc and 1000 1200 for liquid h2o2 gao et al 2020 moreover the carbonate ion in spc can accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 and generate more steady state concentration of radicals such as the carbonate radical anion although the oxidation capacity of the carbonate radical anion e co 3 co 3 2 1 78 v vs she at ph 7 shafirovich et al 2001 is weaker than that of the hydroxyl radical e oh h 2 o 2 32 v vs she at ph 7 wood 1988 the steady state concentrations are also important co 3 ss in sunlit surface water is about two orders of magnitude higher than oh ss sulzberger et al 1997 hence spc is more suited for applications to eliminate harmful algae from freshwater especially for the cyanobacterial species such as pseudanabaena limnetica and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii that are distributed uniformly throughout the whole water column yang et al 2018 evaluated the effectiveness of h2o2 on four cyanobacterial cultures and their results showed that the half maximally effective concentration ec50 for unicellular microcystis ec50 5 06 mg l was about ten times higher than those for filamentous anabaena planktothrix and cylindrospermopsis they also found that the ec50 for these three kinds of filamentous cyanobacteria above were all similar average ec50 is 0 41 mg l yang et al 2018 however it was found that the cell lysis rates due to spc differed between filamentous pseudanabaena limnetica raphidiopsis curvata and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in this study many factors may contribute to the susceptibility of filamentous cyanobacteria including strain specificity cell membrane thickness growth stage and the presence or absence of a mucilaginous sheath wert et al 2013 and the specific mechanisms should be further studied in the future overall the dose of spc used in real reservoirs or lakes should be dependant on the species of cyanobacteria 3 0 mg l spc is effective to inhibit the growth of filamentous cyanobacteria in the surface and bottom water in this study meanwhile this dosage of spc has a slight effect on eukaryotic communities and the diversity of the eukaryotes remained similar to that in the raw water when 3 0 mg l spc was used notably the average depth of xiashan reservoir in this study is only 5 5 m because the oxidation of spc decreased with lower light intensity a higher dosage of spc should be added for a deeper reservoir or lake in addition the application of spc as an algaecide should always occur during the early stages of the cyanobacterial bloom when cell densities are low so as to minimize extracellular toxins and odour compounds castro et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 xu et al 2019 4 conclusions the main cyanobacteria in the surface and bottom water were pseudanabaena limnetica cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and raphidiopsis curvata the eukaryotic microorganisms greatly differed between the surface and bottom water application of spc can eliminate filamentous cyanobacteria throughout the whole reservoir including the surface and bottom layers 3 0 mg l spc has a slight impact on microeukaryotic communities while 6 0 mg l spc changed the composition of eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton markedly because of the higher oxidation capacity of spc in the surface water the stability of the treated surface water was lower than that of the bottom water overall this study provides important information and guidance for reservoir operators assessing treatment options for blooms of cyanobacteria especially for harmful cyanobacteria such as pseudanabaena limnetica and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii which can grow in the middle and bottom

17052,the increasing frequency and intensity of blooms of toxin and taste odour producing filamentous cyanobacteria in water sources is a growing global issue compared to the common spherical microcystis genus the removal of filamentous cyanobacteria is more difficult in drinking water treatment plants hence abatement and control of the occurrence and proliferation of harmful filamentous cyanobacteria within drinking water sources is important for water supply in this study the solid sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 was used as an algaecide to eliminate the cyanobacteria distributed throughout the water column in the surface and bottom layer of a reservoir serving as a drinking water source results showed that although the oxidation capacity of spc was higher in the surface water due to the higher light intensity than in the bottom water 3 0 mg l spc can still suppress the harmful cyanobacteria in the bottom water after 36 h because the carbonate ion generated by spc decomposition can act as an activator of h2o2 to generate many reactive oxygen species including superoxide radicals carbonate radical anions and hydroxyl radicals even in the light limited environment the obtained inactivation rates for the main cyanobacteria in this reservoir followed the order pseudanabaena limnetica raphidiopsis curvata cylindrospermopsis raciborskii 3 0 mg l spc has a slight impact on microeukaryotic communities according to the 18s rrna gene sequencing while 6 0 mg l spc changed the composition of eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton clearly eukaryotic co occurrence networks showed that although the network of eukaryotic plankton in treated surface water was more compact and clustered stability of microeukaryotes in the treated surface water was lower than for the treated bottom water owing to the higher oxidation capacity of spc in the surface water the results above not only have important implications for full scale control of harmful cyanobacteria in drinking water sources especially filamentous cyanobacteria with vertical distributions but also help to ensure the health and stability of the whole aquatic ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous cyanobacteria sodium percarbonate microeukaryotic communities co occurrence network drinking water source 1 introduction eutrophication and global climate change are promoting the proliferation of harmful cyanobacterial blooms which have increasingly become a major nuisance in many marine and freshwater ecosystems brookes and carey 2011 huisman et al 2018 chapra et al 2017 projected the influence of climate change on harmful algal blooms in the united states freshwaters according to five global circulation models and found that the mean number of days with harmful cyanobacterial blooms will rise from about 7 days per year per waterbody under current conditions to 18 39 days in 2090 in the united states a high density of cyanobacterial blooms can not only block the light from reaching other phytoplankton mur et al 1999 huisman et al 2004 but also affect the growth of herbivorous zooplankton ghadouani et al 2003 wilson et al 2006 more seriously some cyanobacteria can produce toxins such as microcystins mcs and cylindrospermopsin which can cause serious and even fatal liver digestive and neurological diseases merel et al 2013 huisman et al 2018 hence the world health organization proposed a guideline limit of 1 μg l for microcystin lr one of the most common mcs in drinking water who 2008 some cyanobacteria can produce taste and odour compounds which interfere with the recreational function of lakes and the use of reservoirs for drinking water izaguirre et al 1999 niiyama et al 2016 huang et al 2018 for example the most common off flavour compounds geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib will impart a muddy or earthy musty flavour to drinking water at even 4 10 ng l cook et al 2001 hence the odour compounds threshold concentration in drinking water is 10 ng l in china mh and sac 2006 and the odour in drinking water should be less than 3 threshold odour numbers in the u s a us epa 2018 several methods of preventing cyanobacterial blooms have been suggested most chemical methods to remove harmful algae will result in the production of harmful by products or the accumulation of heavy metals such as cu in ecosystems huisman et al 2018 xu et al 2019 hence there is a clear need for an effective means of suppressing the proliferation of upcoming cyanobacterial blooms whilst also being environmentally benign because hydrogen peroxide h2o2 decomposes to water and oxygen without chemical residues it has been used as a benign chemical to decrease cyanobacteria barrington and ghadouani 2008 barrington et al 2013 besides that it is intriguing that h2o2 may have a more pronounced effect on cyanobacteria which are prokaryotic than on the eukaryotic phytoplankton whose photosynthetic apparatus are contained within discrete organelles barrington and ghadouani 2008 matthijs et al 2012 weenink et al 2015 matthijs et al 2012 studied the influence of h2o2 on the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix agardhii in lake koetshuis the netherlands and found that 2 0 mg l h2o2 could prevent the excessive multiplication of planktothrix agardhii in the surface water meanwhile there was little effect on the eukaryotic phytoplankton including green algae cryptophytes chrysophytes and diatoms zooplankton and macrofauna in recent years some filamentous cyanobacteria such as pseudanabaena sp which are important 2 mib contributing algae in many lakes and reservoirs and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii which can produce cylindrospermopsin have become the main cyanobacterial species all over the word izaguirre et al 1999 niiyama et al 2016 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018a remarkably these cyanobacteria i e pseudanabaena sp and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii can adapt to grow in low light environments the middle and bottom of a water body and are often distributed uniformly through the water column newcombe 2009 although h2o2 can inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria and degrade toxins odours in the water surface by producing reactive oxygen species under light or uv radiation barrington and ghadouani 2008 the degradation of cyanobacteria by h2o2 in middle and bottom water may be weak due to the light limitation piel et al 2020 sodium percarbonate spc na2co3 1 5h2o2 as an adduct of 32 5 h2o2 and 67 5 na2co3 by mass has recently attracted researchers attention greenfield et al 2014 ma et al 2018 from a practical point of view as it is a solid reagent spc is more convenient to handle and deliver than h2o2 additionally spc is also relatively stable in underground environments compared to h2o2 most importantly the carbonate ion can act as an activator of h2o2 to generate many reactive oxygen species including superoxide radicals carbonate radical anions and hydroxyl radicals even in a light limited environment as shown in eqs 1 6 li et al 2018b hence it is possible to use spc to control the harmful algae in bottom water however to the best of our knowledge there is no research on the effect of spc on cyanobacteria especially the filamentous cyanobacteria in the bottom layer of a lake or reservoir 1 h 2 o 2 co 3 2 ho 2 hco 3 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 ho 2 oh o h 3 ho 2 o

though several researchers have investigated the effect of h2o2 on eukaryotic phytoplankton by microscopic observation barrington and ghadouani 2008 matthijs et al 2012 analyses of eukaryotic plankton communities were mainly limited to some abundant taxa because of past methodological limitations a recent revolution in high throughput and deep sequencing is now allowing a much more direct identification of the rare taxa in a given environment pedrós alió 2012 chen et al 2019 which may be beneficial to the study of the effect of oxidation on the whole eukaryotic community hence the aims of this study were twofold 1 investigation of the effect of spc on the filamentous cyanobacteria including whether spc can efficiently suppress the growth of filamentous species is the oxidation effect of spc on cyanobacteria similar in different water layers do the various species of filamentous cyanobacteria have the same response to spc 2 explication of whether the spc kills the eukaryotic microbiomes or restrains their growth including whether the main kinds of eukaryote meet the same fate after contact with spc in the water body would eukaryotic microbiomes remain stable at a favourable level if this technique were used to control the filamentous cyanobacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the raw bloom water containing pseudanabaena limnetica and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was sampled in august 2019 from the xiashan reservoir 119 21 119 31 e 36 16 36 31 n an important drinking water source in weifang city shandong province china with a

pairwise spearman s rank correlations r between those otus were calculated within the picante r package only robust r 0 8 and statistically significant p 0 01 correlations were incorporated into network analyses network visualization and topological properties such as the network density i e a normalized value for the average number of neighbours 0 1 scale and the network clustering coefficient i e a mean value of clustering coefficients for all nodes 0 1 scale were obtained with gephi version 0 9 2 to evaluate the experimental repeatability the biological triplicates of s1 the raw surface bloom water table s1 were analysed all of the parameters were compared across treatments with one way anova using the spss software version 16 0 and the significance was set to p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of spc on algae in the surface and bottom bloom water cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms accounted for the main species found in the surface and bottom bloom water and the total biovolumes of algae were also similar figure s1 cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the surface water accounted for 35 6 11 8 and 52 2 of the total algal biovolume respectively whilst the proportion of cyanobacterial biovolume 45 9 in bottom water was higher than that in the surface water p 0 01 and the green algae s proportion 5 0 in bottom water was lower than that in surface water p 0 01 cyanobacteria were mainly made up of pseudanabaena limnetica cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and raphidiopsis curvata of which pseudanabaena limnetica was predominant in xiashan reservoir in the present study liu et al 2019 reported that the principal cyanobacteria in shidou reservoir were cylindrospermopsis raciborskii raphidiopsis sp and pseudanabaena sp of these cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was the most abundant specie the difference above may be attributed to the fact that shidou reservoir is a subtropical reservoir which would be beneficial to the growth of cylindrospermopsis raciborskii li et al 2018a while xiashan reservoir is a temperate reservoir fragilaria capucina and synedra acusvar were the main species amongst the diatoms in the surface and bottom water samples the green algae mainly comprised chlorella vulgaris chlorella pyrenoidosa and chlorella ellipsoidea in the surface and bottom water changes in the densities of total algae cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the surface and bottom water samples after treatment with different doses of spc 3 0 and 6 0 mg l are shown in fig 1 the densities of total algae and cyanobacteria declined rapidly especially when the spc dose was 6 0 mg l however there was a slight decrease in the green algae and diatoms concentrations after oxidation for 36 h especially when the spc dose was 3 0 mg l the results above mean that cyanobacteria were more sensitive to spc compared with green algae and diatoms which was similar to the study of matthijs et al 2012 who found that the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix agardhii could be controlled effectively when 2 0 mg l h2o2 was added while there were no major impacts on green algae or diatoms it was reported that h2o2 could be produced by the mehler reaction in eukaryotic phytoplankton and higher plants when exposed to high light intensity asada 2006 however the mehler reaction does not produce h2o2 or other reactive oxygen species in cyanobacteria latifi et al 2009 allahverdiyeva et al 2011 hence the higher sensitivity of prokaryotic cyanobacteria to spc compared with the eukaryotic green algae and diatoms may be due to the lower anti oxidation capability in cyanobacterial cells furthermore the cell walls of eukaryotic green algae and diatoms are thicker than prokaryotic cyanobacteria hoiczyk and hansel 2000 hence green algae and diatoms have stronger antioxidant capacity to resist the effect of spc furthermore it was found that the reduction in cell numbers was higher in surface water than that in bottom water and the extracellular doc level in the bottom water was lower than that in the surface water figure s2 implying that the oxidation capacity of spc was higher in the surface water this may be attributed to the higher intensity of simulated sunlight especially the uv part in surface water which accelerated the reaction of h2o2 with co3 2 and the ensuing decomposition of h2o2 see figure s3 ma et al 2018 3 2 kinetics of algal cell lysis in the surface and bottom bloom water huo et al 2015 and xu et al 2019 reported that the delayed chick watson model was suitable to calculate cell lysis rates of algae after h2o2 treatment and a lag phase was found between the addition of h2o2 and the membrane rupture of algal cells the lag phase was also observed for oxidation of microcystis aeruginosa cells by k2feo4 and chlorination fan et al 2016 2018 hence the delayed chick watson model proposed by huo et al 2015 was applied to estimate cell lysis rates for the spc treatment as follows n n 0 1 c t c t lag e x p k c t c t lag c t c t lag where t s is the contact time n 0 is the number of intact cells at t 0 n is the number of intact cells after a given treatment c m is the oxidant concentration ct m s is oxidant exposure value ct lag m s is the lag phase ct and k m 1 s 1 is the rate constant at which lysis occurs the lysis rate of algae increased when the dose of spc rose from 3 0 mg l to 6 0 mg l fig 2 furthermore it was found that the lysis rates of cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the surface water were higher than those in the bottom water with the 6 0 mg l spc p 0 05 the reason may be due to the higher light intensity especially the uv in the treatment of the surface bloom water which accelerate the composition of h2o2 and reactive oxygen species production xu et al 2019 it was intriguing that the lysis rate due to spc was much higher for cyanobacteria than for green algae and diatoms the latter two being similar for example the lysis rates for the three types of algae were 1 739 0 380 and 0 407 m 1 s 1 when 6 0 mg l spc was added to treat the surface water fig 2 in addition the lysis rates due to spc of pseudanabaena limnetica cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and raphidiopsis curvata which are cyanobacteria were also studied table 1 and figure s4 we also found that the lysis rates for pseudanabaena limnetica cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and raphidiopsis curvata grew with an increase in the spc dose from 3 0 to 6 0 mg l and their lysis rates were faster in surface water than in bottom water when 6 0 mg l spc added p 0 05 interestingly the obtained inactivation rates for these three kinds of cyanobacteria followed the order pseudanabaena limnetica raphidiopsis curvata cylindrospermopsis raciborskii their sensitivity to spc may be related to their morphology and other characteristics for example it was reported that the cell wall thicknesses of pseudanabaena limnetica and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were about 40 and 56 nm respectively sorokovikova et al 2008 wejnerowski et al 2018 in our previous study the lysis rate of pseudanabaena galeata due to h2o2 was 2 72 m 1 s 1 when the initial concentration of h2o2 was 3 0 mg l under sunlight xu et al 2019 correspondingly the lysis rate of pseudanabaena limnetica due to spc was 2 08 m 1 s 1 with 6 0 mg l spc equating to 2 0 mg l h2o2 under simulated sunlight in the surface layer although the carbonate ion which is generated by the decomposition of spc can act as an activator of h2o2 to generate reactive oxygen species the lower lysis rate of pseudanabaena limnetica in the presence of spc may be due to the following reasons 1 the light in the surface layer is 150 μmol photons m 2s 1 which was lower than that in our previous study 460 μmol photons m 2s 1 2 the initial concentration of pseudanabaena limnetica in surface bloom water was 8 1 104 cells ml which was higher than that in our previous study 6 0 104 cells ml 3 the water matrix was different such as tn in the surface bloom water 1 23 mg l was obviously higher than our previous study 0 132 mg l and 4 there was only pseudanabaena limnetica in the bloom water of xu s study whereas green algae diatoms and other species of cyanobacteria were included in the surface bloom water and pseudanabaena limnetica only accounting for 15 9 of total algal biovolume the competition of them with pseudanabaena limnetica for the oxidant chemicals will reduce lysis rate of pseudanabaena limnetica 3 3 dynamics of eukaryotic community compositions to evaluate the effect of spc on eukaryotic communities in the surface and bottom water 18s rrna genes were analysed overall the sequencing of 18s rrna genes yielded 614 107 high quality sequences and 2190 otus at 97 similarity level the chao indices in s1 and b1 were 813 and 553 respectively which indicate that the richness in surface water was markedly higher than that in bottom water it was found that the chao index declined slightly with 3 0 mg l spc for the surface water and bottom water fig 3 a and b while the chao index decreased greatly when the dose of spc was 6 0 mg l implying that the richness of the eukaryotic communities in the surface and bottom water was not changed much with 3 0 mg l spc however 6 0 mg l spc substantially changed the richness of the samples the shannon index in s1 was higher than that in b1 fig 3 c and d signifying the richer diversity in s1 compared with b1 for the surface water the shannon indices were respectively 4 62 4 68 and 4 27 after 0 6 and 18 h oxidation with 3 0 mg l spc furthermore the shannon index changed to 4 62 and 3 17 after 6 and 18 h oxidation with 6 0 mg l spc fig 3 c these results suggest that although the diversity was decreased slightly with 3 0 mg l spc for the surface water the diversity declined noticeably following oxidation by 6 0 mg l spc for 18 h interestingly the shannon index for the bottom water was practically unchanged with different spc doses and reaction times the reason should be the weaker oxidation capability of spc in the bottom water triplicate relative abundances of annotated contiguous eukaryote sequences of s1 s1 1 s1 2 and s1 3 are compared and shown in figure s5 it is both qualitatively and quantitatively evident from the scatter plots and line of best fit statistics that there is a high level of reproducibility i e results are non random in the high throughput sequencing data nmds was performed to evaluate the variation in eukaryotic communities after the treatment with spc fig 3 e usually the closer the plotting of two samples the more similar are their compositions firstly it is notable that the eukaryotic communities differed between s1 and b1 which was in accordance with the findings from the chao and shannon indices above secondly after the treatment of the surface water the samples were close together with the exception of s5 implying that although the composition of the eukaryotic communities changed after spc oxidation the composition was not varied dramatically except for s5 thirdly the composition of eukaryotes in bottom water treated with 3 0 mg l spc was slightly changed however eukaryotic communities did change clearly when 6 0 mg l spc was added and the oxidation time was 18 h b5 of all the total sequences 4 4 were not classified at the phylum level and eukaryotic compositions at the phylum level for each sample are shown in fig 4 the main phyla in the surface water were ciliophora cryptophyta rotifera ochrophyta and chloroplastida meanwhile gracilipodida chloroplastida ciliophora rotifera alveolata and ochrophyta were the dominant phyla in the bottom water it is intriguing that cryptophyta was the second most abundant microeukaryote in surface water whereas there was basically no cryptophyta in bottom water the reason may be attributable to the fact that the transparency of the water in xiashan reservoir was 1 4 m in august and the prevalence of cryptophyta in surface water benefitted from photosynthesis moreover it is notable that gracilipodida and alveolata were the dominant phyla in bottom water but conversely there was no gracilipodida or alveolata in surface water the predominance of gracilipodida and alveolata in bottom water may be influenced by the low temperature and high nutrient level of that environment for instance it was reported that alveolata actively grazed on microbial mats adjacent to cold seeps takishita et al 2010 in addition liu et al 2019 investigated the eukaryotic community of a subtropical reservoir by analysing the surface water during a cyanobacterial bloom and found that metazoa dinophyta cryptophyta ciliophora fungi and stramenopiles predominated although they sampled surface water during the cyanobacterial bloom the microeukaryotic communities were clearly different from ours there may be two reasons for this first of all xiashan reservoir is a temperate reservoir while the reservoir in liu s study is a subtropical reservoir eukaryotic community structure in surface water could be influenced by water quality such as water temperature and so forth secondly the predominant cyanobacterium in xiashan reservoir was pseudanabaena limnetica whereas cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was the main cyanobacterium in the reservoir of liu s study as shown in fig 4 relative abundance of chloroplastida which was composed by green algae basically accounted for microeukaryotic community was changed marginally after 3 0 mg l spc added because the green algae density was not declined obviously with 3 0 mg l spc fig 1 it can be inferred that the variation of absolute abundance for the whole microeukaryotic community was slight when 3 0 mg l spc was added in the surface and bottom water furthermore the relative abundance of ochrophyta and chloroplastida increased in the surface and bottom water after 6 0 mg l spc treatment correspondingly ciliophora and cryptophyta s relative abundance in surface water and the relative abundance of gracilipodida and alveolata in bottom water reduced greatly especially after 6 0 mg l spc teatment which suggest that ciliophora gracilipodida and alveolata which are unicellular protozoa and cryptophyta were more sensitive to spc in comparison to ochrophyta and chloroplastida fig 4 matthijs et al 2012 studied the effect of h2o2 on eukaryotic microbes and found that eukaryotic phytoplankton could thrive when the concentration of h2o2 was 2 5 mg l however the zooplankton were noticeably affected which means that the antioxidant capacity of zooplankton was weaker than the eukaryotic phytoplankton holm et al 2008 investigated the effect of high power ultrasound on the survival of phytoplankton and zooplankton and found that treatment with ultrasound was more effective in killing zooplankton than phytoplankton although cryptophyta are eukaryotic phytoplankton the rapid degradation of cryptophyta when spc was added should be due to the lack of cell walls in cryptophyta schiewer and volesky 2000 the abundance of ciliophora increased in bottom water and surface water when the oxidation time was less than 6 h however ciliophora abundance in surface water declined from 34 2 and 35 7 to 19 3 and 4 5 respectively when the oxidation time increased from 6 to 18 h with 3 0 and 6 0 mg l spc the results indicate that ciliophora can withstand low levels of oxidation potential furthermore it was found that the abundance of rotifera which are micrometazoa did not change perceptibly during the treatment process yang et al 2018 reported that rotifera have a strong antioxidation capacity and there was basically no effect on rotifera even when 6 7 mg l h2o2 was added the abundances of gracilipodida and alveolata decreased when the reaction time was prolonged and the spc dose increased implying that gracilipodida and alveolata were very sensitive to spc studies have determined that different zooplankton genera have different susceptibilities to h2o2 reichwaldt et al 2012 barrington et al 2013 implying that different genera of zooplankton have different degrees of antioxidant capacity hence the different mortalities of ciliophora rotifera gracilipodida and alveolata in response to spc may be due to their different characteristics the specific reasons for which should be studied in future eukaryotic co occurrence networks were used to investigate key eukaryotic groups and associations between otus at the phylum level for the surface and bottom bloom water treated with spc each node is an otu and eukaryotes belonging to the same phylum tended to present more associations than eukaryotes from different phyla fig 5 ciliophora and ochrophyta represented the majority of otus in the network of the treated surface bloom water followed by chloroplastida chytridiomycota and cercozoa however for the bottom water treated with spc the chloroplastida and ochrophyta nodes were the most dominant in the network followed by ciliophora cercozoa and chytridiomycota as shown in fig 5 there were 234 nodes with 3513 edges positive associations 71 3 for the treated surface bloom water but only 190 nodes with 1953 edges positive associations 71 5 for the treated bottom bloom water the network density and the network clustering coefficient were greater for the treated surface water than the treated bottom water fig 5 jeong et al 2016 reported that the higher the values of network density and network clustering coefficient the more compact and clustered of the network hence the network of the surface water treated with spc was more compact and clustered compared with the bottom water oxidated by spc douterelo et al 2020 reported that the ratio between density and clustering coefficient of the network can represent the stability of the networks and the lower this ratio the higher the stability of the network the ratio between density d and clustering coefficient transitivity t in the network of the treated surface water d 0 129 t 0 684 d t 0 189 was higher than that of the treated bottom water d 0 109 t 0 612 d t 0 178 which means the stability of the treated surface water was lower than that of the bottom water resilience refers to the capacity of an ecosystem to recover from a perturbation by the rapid recovery of the eukaryotic community without ending in a different state kim et al 2018 the higher stability of the eukaryotes in treated bottom water means they will be more resilient to perturbations e g change in hydraulic regime temperature etc although the network of the treated surface water was more compact and clustered the more fragile communities may be associated with the higher oxidation capacity of spc in the surface water and with a susceptible composition of the microeukaryotes for instance cryptophyta which was very sensitive to spc and was the second most abundant microeukaryote in surface water conversely practically no cryptophyta was found in bottom water 3 4 operational applications and recommendations compared with h2o2 which is viewed as an environmentally friendly alternative algaecide barrington and ghadouani 2008 barrington et al 2013 the solid and stable spc is more convenient to use in reservoirs and lakes the normalized prices per metric ton of h2o2 are 300 350 for spc and 1000 1200 for liquid h2o2 gao et al 2020 moreover the carbonate ion in spc can accelerate the decomposition of h2o2 and generate more steady state concentration of radicals such as the carbonate radical anion although the oxidation capacity of the carbonate radical anion e co 3 co 3 2 1 78 v vs she at ph 7 shafirovich et al 2001 is weaker than that of the hydroxyl radical e oh h 2 o 2 32 v vs she at ph 7 wood 1988 the steady state concentrations are also important co 3 ss in sunlit surface water is about two orders of magnitude higher than oh ss sulzberger et al 1997 hence spc is more suited for applications to eliminate harmful algae from freshwater especially for the cyanobacterial species such as pseudanabaena limnetica and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii that are distributed uniformly throughout the whole water column yang et al 2018 evaluated the effectiveness of h2o2 on four cyanobacterial cultures and their results showed that the half maximally effective concentration ec50 for unicellular microcystis ec50 5 06 mg l was about ten times higher than those for filamentous anabaena planktothrix and cylindrospermopsis they also found that the ec50 for these three kinds of filamentous cyanobacteria above were all similar average ec50 is 0 41 mg l yang et al 2018 however it was found that the cell lysis rates due to spc differed between filamentous pseudanabaena limnetica raphidiopsis curvata and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in this study many factors may contribute to the susceptibility of filamentous cyanobacteria including strain specificity cell membrane thickness growth stage and the presence or absence of a mucilaginous sheath wert et al 2013 and the specific mechanisms should be further studied in the future overall the dose of spc used in real reservoirs or lakes should be dependant on the species of cyanobacteria 3 0 mg l spc is effective to inhibit the growth of filamentous cyanobacteria in the surface and bottom water in this study meanwhile this dosage of spc has a slight effect on eukaryotic communities and the diversity of the eukaryotes remained similar to that in the raw water when 3 0 mg l spc was used notably the average depth of xiashan reservoir in this study is only 5 5 m because the oxidation of spc decreased with lower light intensity a higher dosage of spc should be added for a deeper reservoir or lake in addition the application of spc as an algaecide should always occur during the early stages of the cyanobacterial bloom when cell densities are low so as to minimize extracellular toxins and odour compounds castro et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 xu et al 2019 4 conclusions the main cyanobacteria in the surface and bottom water were pseudanabaena limnetica cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and raphidiopsis curvata the eukaryotic microorganisms greatly differed between the surface and bottom water application of spc can eliminate filamentous cyanobacteria throughout the whole reservoir including the surface and bottom layers 3 0 mg l spc has a slight impact on microeukaryotic communities while 6 0 mg l spc changed the composition of eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton markedly because of the higher oxidation capacity of spc in the surface water the stability of the treated surface water was lower than that of the bottom water overall this study provides important information and guidance for reservoir operators assessing treatment options for blooms of cyanobacteria especially for harmful cyanobacteria such as pseudanabaena limnetica and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii which can grow in the middle and bottom

17053,biogas produced from anaerobic digestion usually contains 30 50 co2 much of which must be removed before utilization bioelectrochemical biogas upgrading approaches show promise however they have not yet been optimized for practical applications in this study a bioelectrochemical system with low energy input applied cathode potential of 0 5 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she was used for in situ biogas upgrading high efficiency co2 conversion 318 5 mol d m2 was achieved when the system was operated with an organic load of 1 7 kgcod m3 d methane content in the upgraded biogas was 97 0 and co2 concentrations stayed below 3 which is comparable to biogas upgraded with more expensive and less sustainable physiochemical approaches the high efficiency of this approach could likely be attributed to a significant enrichment of methanothrix 92 7 species on the cathode surface that were expressing genes involved in both acetogenic methanogenesis and direct electron transfer det electromethanogenesis by these organisms also increased proton consumption and created a higher ph that increased the solubility of co2 in the bioreactor in addition co2 removal from the biogas was likely further enhanced by an enrichment of actinobacillus species known to be capable of co2 fixation artificial neural network ann models were also used to estimate ch4 production under different loading conditions the ann architecture with 10 neurons at hidden layers fit best with a mean square error of 6 06 10 3 and r2 of 0 99 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biogas upgrading direct electron transfer methanothrix co2 reduction artificial neural network 1 introduction biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes e g food waste and disposal sludge is an important source of bioenergy dang et al 2016 jia et al 2020 lei et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 biogas generated by anaerobic digesters that are operating efficiently is composed of 50 70 ch4 and 30 50 co2 and various concentrations of such contaminants as ammonia water vapor hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide awe et al 2017 while this non treated biogas can be used directly as a fuel removal of co2 and the other contaminants significantly improves the gas quality awe et al 2017 in fact the energy density of the biogas is proportional to its methane content esposito et al 2019 and in order for it to be utilized as a renewable energy source that can be transported through the already existing natural gas pipelines its ch4 content needs to be dramatically reduced to levels similar to natural gas 85 96 ch4 faramawy et al 2016 there are a variety of biogas upgrading technologies currently in use including physical chemical adsorption pressure swing adsorption and membrane separation augelletti et al 2017 baker 2012 yoo et al 2013 compared to these physical chemical technologies bioelectrochemical approaches are much more economic and environmentally friendly angelidaki et al 2018 kapoor et al 2019 liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 unfortunately co2 conversion efficiencies and ch4 content after upgrading with these bioelectrochemical approaches are usually lower than what can be achieved with physiochemical methods angelidaki et al 2018 kapoor et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 in previous studies it was found that the majority of co2 that could not be bioelectrochemically converted into ch4 was removed from biogas by dissolving in the liquid phase h2co3 hco3 co3 2 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 based on these observations it seems that bioelectrochemically produced biogas could be significantly improved not only by enhancing co2 conversion rates but also by increasing the fraction of co2 dissolved in the liquid phase methanogens are responsible for the conversion of co2 into ch4 during bioelectrochemical biogas upgrading in anaerobic digesters they reduce co2 to methane using electrons from fermentation products generated by bacteria holmes and smith 2016 by forming syntrophic partnerships with bacteria to directly or indirectly i e through hydrogen or formate accept electrons from bacteria blasco gómez et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b zheng et al 2020 or by accepting electrons directly from a cathode cheng et al 2009 lohner et al 2014 rowe et al 2019 villano et al 2010 yee and rotaru 2020 the theoretical cathode potential required for co2 reduction by methanogens directly accepting electrons from a cathode or another organism co2 8h 8e ch4 h2o δe 244 mv vs standard hydrogen electrode she is different from the cathode potential for co2 reduction fueled by the indirect uptake of electrons through a soluble electron shuttle such as h2 2h 2e h2 δe 414 mv vs she co2 4h2 ch4 h2o δe 244 mv vs she direct electron transfer det avoids h2 generation and has been shown to be more energy efficient holmes and smith 2016 rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b in our previous studies a bioelectrochemical system poised at a cathode potential of 0 5 v vs she which is close to the potential required for det was operated for biogas upgrading liu et al 2019 2020 while this det based system increased biogas ch4 content from 77 to 91 2 with low energy input liu et al 2019 2020 this was still not competitive compared with physicochemical methods and some bioelectrochemical systems bes that require high energy inputs jin et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 bes that require low energy inputs are much more sustainable than physiochemical methods or bes that require high energy inputs for biogas upgrading therefore it is important to develop methods to increase co2 conversion efficiencies in det based systems with low energy inputs analysis of the methanogenic community in the det based system described above revealed that methanothrix species were the predominant methanogens on the cathode surface and that they were highly expressing genes required for direct electron uptake from a cathode liu et al 2019 2020 therefore increases in methanothrix abundance on the cathode could theoretically increase det and improve the biogas upgrading process in this study an in situ biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical system was operated with stepwise increases in influent organic loading rates the biogas upgrading performance was monitored and a high ch4 content after upgrading of 97 was obtained when influent organic loading was increased microbial community and transcriptomic analyses revealed that methanothrix were significantly enriched on the cathode surface and ann models were used to predict the performance of co2 reduction via det under different loading rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical reactor design setup and operation the biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical reactor with a 0 8 l working volume φ100 mm 165 mm was designed as a modified microbial electrolysis cell mec and operated at 37 1 c following the previous study liu et al 2019 the reactor was divided into anode and cathode chambers by a cylinder φ30 mm 130 mm made from a cation exchange membrane cem cmi 7000 membrane international inc nj 07456 as previously described liu et al 2019 2020 the anode cathode and reference electrodes were made of a graphite rod φ6 mm 80 mm a graphite plate 60 mm 25 mm 6 mm and an ag agcl electrode 199 mv vs she respectively the mec reactor was initially inoculated with 400 ml of anaerobic sludge from a laboratory anaerobic digester treating synthetic wastewater jia et al 2020 acetate was supplied as the sole electron donor in artificial wastewater that was fed to the cathode chamber of the mec and its concentration was incrementally increased during the operational phase the composition of artificial wastewater consisted of the following per liter excluding the electron donor 0 11 g of kh2po4 0 11 g of k2hpo4 0 5 g of nahco3 0 05 g of cacl2 2h2o 0 05 g of naso4 0 10 g of mgcl 6h2o 6 mg of cocl2 5 mg of nicl2 6h2o 10 ml of trace element solution and 10 ml of vitamin solution dang et al 2016 the solution added to the anode chamber was similar to the artificial wastewater without acetate and vitamins oxygen was removed from all wastewater by flushing with n2 co2 80 20 for 30 min prior to use the concentration of total inorganic carbon tic including co3 2 hco3 and co2 h2co3 in the feed solution was about 10 0 mm after aeration the hydraulic retention time was kept constant at 1 4 days controlled by the peristaltic pump longerpump china the whole experimental phase was divided into the start up period 0 17 days and the power on period 18 66 days respectively the applied cathode potential was set with a potentiostat chi1030c ch instruments inc shanghai china at 500 mv vs she during the power on period no power was applied during the start up period the power on period was further divided into stage i 18 44 days stage ii 45 54 days and stage iii 55 66 days based on influent acetate concentrations the chemical oxygen demand cod of the three power on stages was 600 mg l 1200 mg l and 2400 mg l respectively biomass concentrations in the bulk sludge increased from 4 1 gvss volatile suspended solid l to 4 5 gvss l during the operational period and this was probably caused by the slow growth rate of methanogens 2 2 chemical analyses cod and vss concentrations were measured by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater american public health association 1995 tic concentrations were measured with a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena ger ph was measured with a hach ph meter hach usa the composition of ch4 and co2 in the biogas was analyzed by a gas chromatograph tianmei gc7900 china with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and the volume of biogas was measured with a digital mass flow meter fma4000 omega usa ch4 co2 production in biogas were calculated by the composition and volume of biogas current intensity was monitored with an electrochemical station chi1030c china and current density was calculated by dividing current intensity by the projected surface area of the cathode miller et al 2019 2 3 microbial community

neural network bp ann models were developed with the neural network toolbox in matlab r2017b the bp ann models were comprised of 3 neuron layers namely an input a hidden and an output layer the number of neurons in the input and output layers was the same as the number of input and output variables 7 and 2 respectively the seven input variables included time d influent cod mg cod l effluent cod mg cod l cod consumption mg cod l co2 gas m mol tic yield m mol and co2 yield m mol l the two output variables were total ch4 yield mg cod l and the ch4 yield mg cod l via det descriptive statistics of

n x i w i b where xi is the ith input wi is the connection weight of ith input b is the bias of neuron and fact is the activation function of neuron tangent sigmoid transfer function tansig eq 4 antwi

mean square error mse eq 5 was used to calculate errors between predictive and target values in order to train the proposed ann models the levenberg marquardt trainlm xu et al 2020 back propagation bp algorithm was used to propagate errors and update weights and biases the neurons at the hidden layer transformed the input information beltramo et al 2016 and the neuron count depended on the complexity of the process antwi et al 2018 five to 20 neurons xu et al 2020 were loaded at the hidden layer to develop many models for conducting a benchmark comparison justified by mse and r square

efficiencies stayed above 92 indicating that the reactor was stable under various organic loading rates fig s1 changes in ch4 and co2 concentrations in the biogas were also monitored throughout the experiment once current was applied ch4 content in the biogas was 90 and even reached 97 during stage iii of the power on period fig 1 a co2 content stayed below 3 even when the influent cod was increased to 2400 mg l ch4 yields in biogas also increased after current was applied from 4 8 mmol d to 22 0 mmol d fig 1b while ch4 yields in biogas were high during the power on period co2 yields were only 0 7 mmol d in the final stage of the power on period indicating that this method produced high quality biogas changes in inorganic carbon concentrations and ph were also monitored fig 2 during stages ii and iii of the power on period ic concentrations increased from 18 0 mm to 43 1 mm and corresponded with increases in co2 generated by microbial acetate degradation fig 2a although dissolved co2 concentrations increased with higher influent loading the ph never dropped in fact the ph actually increased from 8 8 to 9 4 fig 2b indicating that proton consumption by methanogens was higher when influent cod was increased from 600 mg l to 2400 mg l previous studies have shown that ph values higher than 8 8 impair acetoclastic methanogenesis o flaherty et al 1998 patel and sprott 1990 however in this study acetoclastic methanogenesis did not appear to be adversely impacted by the elevated ph and acetate removal efficiencies remained higher than 92 during the entire operational period perhaps biofilms that formed on the surface of the cathode protected the active methanogens from the alkaline environment according to carbon balance calculations co2 reduction rates corresponded with stepwise increases in influent cod 112 1 mol d m2 at 600 mg l 219 3 mol d m2 at 1200 mg l and 318 5 mol d m2 at 2400 mg l the higher ph also increased dissolution of co2 in the liquid phase which further improved biogas quality current density can be used to determine co2 reduction rates on the cathode van eerten jansen et al 2012 villano et al 2010 fig s2 current density during stage i was maintained at 3 77 10 5 a m2 and after influent loading increased during stage ii current density decreased to 2 42 10 5 a m2 and finally to 2 27 10 5 a m2 coulombic efficiencies of the three stages were 13 95 43 77 and 68 10 according to eq 2 this showed that more electrons from the cathode were used for co2 reduction when influent cod was high which is consistent with the finding that more co2 was reduced under high loading conditions 3 2 microbial community analysis similar to previous biogas upgrading det systems liu et al 2019 2020 the majority of archaeal sequences on the cathode surface were most similar to methanothrix species 92 7 fig 3 a in previous studies loading concentrations were significantly lower 600 mg l cod and methanothrix only accounted for 70 of the archaeal population liu et al 2019 influent acetate concentrations in this study were significantly higher 2400 mg l and this appeared to favor the growth of methanothrix on the cathode surface methanosarcina were also slightly enriched on the cathode surface 4 of the archaeal sequences and species from this genus have also been shown to participate in det bai et al 2020 rotaru et al 2014a yee et al 2019 bacteria from the genera rectinema ruminiclostridium anaerophaga lentimicrobium and actinobacillus dominated the cathode surface fig 3b most of these genera have been detected in other biogas producing reactors lackner et al 2020 lee et al 2013 solli et al 2014 tao et al 2020 tsavkelova et al 2018 and have fermentative metabolisms that produce end products that can be utilized by methanogens for co2 reduction denger et al 2002 desvaux 2005 kim et al 2020 schöck and perrimon 2002 sun et al 2016 in addition rectinema and ruminiclostridium species appear to be capable of acetate oxidation with methanogens lee et al 2013 zheng et al 2019 and actinobacillus can fix co2 thereby removing it from the gas phase and improving biogas quality gunnarsson et al 2014 zeikus et al 1999 therefore these bacteria were facilitating biogas upgrading indirectly through production of fermentation products and directly by forming syntrophic partnerships with methanogens in the reactor 3 3 transcription of genes from methanothrix expression of key genes coding for proteins involved in methanogenesis by methanothrix were monitored to gain insight into the physiology behind methane production in the mec fig 4 similar to our previous biogas upgrading study liu et al 2019 methanothrix cells growing on the cathode surface were expressing genes coding for proteins involved in det holmes et al 2018 at much high levels than methanothrix cells growing in the surrounding bulk sludge fpod 44 0 times greater hdra 13 0 times and hdrc 3 9 times fig 4 the mcra gene which is required for the final step of all methanogenic pathways holmes and smith 2016 also had 9 8 times higher transcript abundance in cells growing on the electrode compared to cells in the bulk sludge unlike the last study however the number of transcripts for genes coding for enzymes involved in acetate dismutation jetten et al 1990 maupin furlow and ferry 1996 including acs 1228 4 times and cdha 274 9 times were also higher in electrode grown methanothrix cells these results suggest that the increase in ch4 production could be attributed to both co2 reduction via det and acetoclastic methanogenesis by methanothrix 3 4 anns model of biogas upgrading via det a benchmark comparison antwi et al 2017 revealed that when 10 neurons were assigned minimum mse and maximum r2 values were obtained table 2 this optimum bp ann topology is shown in fig s3 the training completed after 17 iterations showed the best performance at 15 epoch with an mse of 6 06 10 3 as illustrated in fig s4 a the training state fig s4 b demonstrated that a well trained model was developed with gradient adaptive and validation check values at 17 epoch of 5 77 10 3 1 10 4 and 2 respectively the mathematical calculation used to determine ch4 yield y k 1 and ch4 yield via det y k 2 for the proposed bp ann models in matrix form mahmoodi babolan et al 2019 is provided in eq 8 8 y k 2 1 exp 2 w out k q t b out k y max k y min k 2 y min k 9 q j 2 1 exp 2 w out j x nor t b hidd j 1 where wout k is the j dimensional weights vector of kth neurons at output layer bout k is the bias of kth neurons at output layer q is the vector comprised with qj eq 9 the output of jth neurons at hidden layer namely q q1 qj q10 whidd j is the i dimensional weights vector of jth neurons at hidden layer bhidd j is the bias of jth neurons at hidden layer xnor is the i dimensional normalized input vector namely xnor xnor 1 xnor i xnor 7 and ymax and ymin is maximum and minimum values over the whole range of the target data the optimum weights and biases are shown in table s2 the ch4 output under different loading conditions and the production of ch4 produced by co2 reduction were predicted with the developed bp ann model table s3 the model s performance on training validation test and all datasets had an r2 level of 0 99208 0 99210 0 91905 and 0 99008 respectively fig 5 these results showed that there was a good correlation between the predicted and experimental data yi fan et al 2017 the proposed ann model could accurately predict the production of ch4 produced by co2 reduction fig s5 which accounted for more than 12 of the total ch4 produced fig 6 the establishment of this model can be used to predict the ch4 output under different loads and also provide a reference for more complex biogas upgrading systems at a potential of 500 mv vs she the ch4 content after upgrading reached 97 0 fig 1a which was higher than many previously published bioelectrochemical methods liu et al 2020 xu et al 2014 and was also competitive compared with some physicochemical methods 96 abdeen et al 2016 muñoz et al 2015 although a previously described electromethanogenesis system produced biogas with 97 9 ch4 this system required a substantially higher energy input e g applied voltage 4 v which led to increased costs zhou et al 2020 alternatively the in situ biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical system reported in this study produces biogas of similar quality but with low energy input the biogas upgrading effect was more significant under higher organic loading rates although the increase in organic loading caused co2 conversion rates to decrease from 11 0 to 6 5 the ch4 content in the biogas still reached 97 and the co2 reduction rate increased to 318 5 mol d m2 the ch4 yield via det also increased from 1 07 mmol d to 4 62 mmol d accounted for 22 2 23 5 in the total ch4 yield it appears that higher concentrations of acetate enhanced both acetoclastic methanogenesis and electromethanogenesis carried out by methanothrix colonizing the cathode and it increased proton consumption by active methanogens creating a higher ph environment that increased the solubility of co2 in the bioreactor the purpose of this study was to optimize the biogas upgrading performance of methanothrix therefore acetate was the only electron donor provided in the feed stock reactors fed real wastewater will have much more complex organic compounds and although acetate is a major intermediate in these reactors other organic intermediates that will influence methanogenesis and biogas composition will also be present dang et al 2016 lei et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in addition alternate electron acceptors such as sulfate and nitrate would also be present in real wastewater and could influence methanogenesis by allowing growth of microbes that could compete with methanogens for substrate or generate products such as h2s nitrite or ammonia that are toxic to methanogens at elevated concentrations klüber and conrad 1998 stefanie et al 1994 the next step needed to ensure that this approach has real world applications is to test actual wastewater and these studies are underway one approach that might help solve some of these potential problems with complex wastewater is to use an ex situ biogas upgrading system xu et al 2014 in these systems the reactor is fed biogas generated by the anaerobic digestion of real organic wastewater thereby bypassing any inhibitory effects that components of complex wastewater might have on methanogenesis in the study conducted by xu et al 2014 this approach was not as efficient as in situ biogas upgrading however further optimization might be possible 4 conclusions in this study a high efficiency in situ biogas upgrading bio electrochemical system with low energy input was developed the bio electrochemical system was operated stably with an applied cathode potential of only 0 5 v vs she the ch4 content after upgrading reached 97 and co2 reduction rates were 318 5 mol d m2 acetoclastic methanogens from the genus methanothrix dominated 92 7 the cathode surface and highly expressed genes related to acetate dismutation and co2 reduction via det the high rate of electromethanogenesis via det also significantly increased proton consumption and created a higher ph that increased the solubility of co2 in the bioreactor which further increased ch4 content in the biogas a suitable ann model was proposed to predict the amount of ch4 production under different loading rates achieving a level of 0 99008 r2 both the operational and ann modeling results

17053,biogas produced from anaerobic digestion usually contains 30 50 co2 much of which must be removed before utilization bioelectrochemical biogas upgrading approaches show promise however they have not yet been optimized for practical applications in this study a bioelectrochemical system with low energy input applied cathode potential of 0 5 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she was used for in situ biogas upgrading high efficiency co2 conversion 318 5 mol d m2 was achieved when the system was operated with an organic load of 1 7 kgcod m3 d methane content in the upgraded biogas was 97 0 and co2 concentrations stayed below 3 which is comparable to biogas upgraded with more expensive and less sustainable physiochemical approaches the high efficiency of this approach could likely be attributed to a significant enrichment of methanothrix 92 7 species on the cathode surface that were expressing genes involved in both acetogenic methanogenesis and direct electron transfer det electromethanogenesis by these organisms also increased proton consumption and created a higher ph that increased the solubility of co2 in the bioreactor in addition co2 removal from the biogas was likely further enhanced by an enrichment of actinobacillus species known to be capable of co2 fixation artificial neural network ann models were also used to estimate ch4 production under different loading conditions the ann architecture with 10 neurons at hidden layers fit best with a mean square error of 6 06 10 3 and r2 of 0 99 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biogas upgrading direct electron transfer methanothrix co2 reduction artificial neural network 1 introduction biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes e g food waste and disposal sludge is an important source of bioenergy dang et al 2016 jia et al 2020 lei et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 biogas generated by anaerobic digesters that are operating efficiently is composed of 50 70 ch4 and 30 50 co2 and various concentrations of such contaminants as ammonia water vapor hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide awe et al 2017 while this non treated biogas can be used directly as a fuel removal of co2 and the other contaminants significantly improves the gas quality awe et al 2017 in fact the energy density of the biogas is proportional to its methane content esposito et al 2019 and in order for it to be utilized as a renewable energy source that can be transported through the already existing natural gas pipelines its ch4 content needs to be dramatically reduced to levels similar to natural gas 85 96 ch4 faramawy et al 2016 there are a variety of biogas upgrading technologies currently in use including physical chemical adsorption pressure swing adsorption and membrane separation augelletti et al 2017 baker 2012 yoo et al 2013 compared to these physical chemical technologies bioelectrochemical approaches are much more economic and environmentally friendly angelidaki et al 2018 kapoor et al 2019 liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 unfortunately co2 conversion efficiencies and ch4 content after upgrading with these bioelectrochemical approaches are usually lower than what can be achieved with physiochemical methods angelidaki et al 2018 kapoor et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 in previous studies it was found that the majority of co2 that could not be bioelectrochemically converted into ch4 was removed from biogas by dissolving in the liquid phase h2co3 hco3 co3 2 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 based on these observations it seems that bioelectrochemically produced biogas could be significantly improved not only by enhancing co2 conversion rates but also by increasing the fraction of co2 dissolved in the liquid phase methanogens are responsible for the conversion of co2 into ch4 during bioelectrochemical biogas upgrading in anaerobic digesters they reduce co2 to methane using electrons from fermentation products generated by bacteria holmes and smith 2016 by forming syntrophic partnerships with bacteria to directly or indirectly i e through hydrogen or formate accept electrons from bacteria blasco gómez et al 2017 rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b zheng et al 2020 or by accepting electrons directly from a cathode cheng et al 2009 lohner et al 2014 rowe et al 2019 villano et al 2010 yee and rotaru 2020 the theoretical cathode potential required for co2 reduction by methanogens directly accepting electrons from a cathode or another organism co2 8h 8e ch4 h2o δe 244 mv vs standard hydrogen electrode she is different from the cathode potential for co2 reduction fueled by the indirect uptake of electrons through a soluble electron shuttle such as h2 2h 2e h2 δe 414 mv vs she co2 4h2 ch4 h2o δe 244 mv vs she direct electron transfer det avoids h2 generation and has been shown to be more energy efficient holmes and smith 2016 rotaru et al 2014a rotaru et al 2014b in our previous studies a bioelectrochemical system poised at a cathode potential of 0 5 v vs she which is close to the potential required for det was operated for biogas upgrading liu et al 2019 2020 while this det based system increased biogas ch4 content from 77 to 91 2 with low energy input liu et al 2019 2020 this was still not competitive compared with physicochemical methods and some bioelectrochemical systems bes that require high energy inputs jin et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 bes that require low energy inputs are much more sustainable than physiochemical methods or bes that require high energy inputs for biogas upgrading therefore it is important to develop methods to increase co2 conversion efficiencies in det based systems with low energy inputs analysis of the methanogenic community in the det based system described above revealed that methanothrix species were the predominant methanogens on the cathode surface and that they were highly expressing genes required for direct electron uptake from a cathode liu et al 2019 2020 therefore increases in methanothrix abundance on the cathode could theoretically increase det and improve the biogas upgrading process in this study an in situ biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical system was operated with stepwise increases in influent organic loading rates the biogas upgrading performance was monitored and a high ch4 content after upgrading of 97 was obtained when influent organic loading was increased microbial community and transcriptomic analyses revealed that methanothrix were significantly enriched on the cathode surface and ann models were used to predict the performance of co2 reduction via det under different loading rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical reactor design setup and operation the biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical reactor with a 0 8 l working volume φ100 mm 165 mm was designed as a modified microbial electrolysis cell mec and operated at 37 1 c following the previous study liu et al 2019 the reactor was divided into anode and cathode chambers by a cylinder φ30 mm 130 mm made from a cation exchange membrane cem cmi 7000 membrane international inc nj 07456 as previously described liu et al 2019 2020 the anode cathode and reference electrodes were made of a graphite rod φ6 mm 80 mm a graphite plate 60 mm 25 mm 6 mm and an ag agcl electrode 199 mv vs she respectively the mec reactor was initially inoculated with 400 ml of anaerobic sludge from a laboratory anaerobic digester treating synthetic wastewater jia et al 2020 acetate was supplied as the sole electron donor in artificial wastewater that was fed to the cathode chamber of the mec and its concentration was incrementally increased during the operational phase the composition of artificial wastewater consisted of the following per liter excluding the electron donor 0 11 g of kh2po4 0 11 g of k2hpo4 0 5 g of nahco3 0 05 g of cacl2 2h2o 0 05 g of naso4 0 10 g of mgcl 6h2o 6 mg of cocl2 5 mg of nicl2 6h2o 10 ml of trace element solution and 10 ml of vitamin solution dang et al 2016 the solution added to the anode chamber was similar to the artificial wastewater without acetate and vitamins oxygen was removed from all wastewater by flushing with n2 co2 80 20 for 30 min prior to use the concentration of total inorganic carbon tic including co3 2 hco3 and co2 h2co3 in the feed solution was about 10 0 mm after aeration the hydraulic retention time was kept constant at 1 4 days controlled by the peristaltic pump longerpump china the whole experimental phase was divided into the start up period 0 17 days and the power on period 18 66 days respectively the applied cathode potential was set with a potentiostat chi1030c ch instruments inc shanghai china at 500 mv vs she during the power on period no power was applied during the start up period the power on period was further divided into stage i 18 44 days stage ii 45 54 days and stage iii 55 66 days based on influent acetate concentrations the chemical oxygen demand cod of the three power on stages was 600 mg l 1200 mg l and 2400 mg l respectively biomass concentrations in the bulk sludge increased from 4 1 gvss volatile suspended solid l to 4 5 gvss l during the operational period and this was probably caused by the slow growth rate of methanogens 2 2 chemical analyses cod and vss concentrations were measured by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater american public health association 1995 tic concentrations were measured with a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena

volume of biogas was measured with a digital mass flow meter fma4000 omega usa ch4 co2 production in biogas were calculated by the composition and volume of biogas current intensity was monitored with an electrochemical station chi1030c china and current density was calculated by dividing current intensity by the projected surface area of the cathode miller et al 2019 2 3 microbial community

data to estimate the training effect cross validation was used to divide the original data in this study 47 samples were randomly divided into a training a validation and a test dataset with 70 15 and

datasets and xmax and xmin is maximum and minimum values over the whole range of the datasets 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of reactors during the entire operational process cod removal efficiencies stayed above 92 indicating that the reactor was stable under various organic loading rates fig s1 changes in ch4 and co2 concentrations in the biogas were also monitored throughout the experiment once current was applied ch4 content in the biogas was 90 and even reached 97 during stage iii of the power on period fig 1 a co2 content stayed below 3 even when the influent cod was increased to 2400 mg l ch4 yields in biogas also increased after current was applied from 4 8 mmol d to 22 0 mmol d fig 1b while ch4 yields in biogas were high during the power on period co2 yields were only 0 7 mmol d in the final stage of the power on period indicating that this method produced high quality biogas changes in inorganic carbon concentrations and ph were also monitored fig 2 during stages ii and iii of the power on period ic concentrations increased from 18 0 mm to 43 1 mm and corresponded with increases in co2 generated by microbial acetate degradation fig 2a although dissolved co2 concentrations increased with higher influent loading the ph never dropped in fact the ph actually increased from 8 8 to 9 4 fig 2b indicating that proton consumption by methanogens was higher when influent cod was increased from 600 mg l to 2400 mg l previous studies have shown that ph values higher than 8 8 impair acetoclastic methanogenesis o flaherty et al 1998 patel and sprott 1990 however in this study acetoclastic methanogenesis did not appear to be adversely impacted by the elevated ph and acetate removal efficiencies remained higher than 92 during the entire operational period perhaps biofilms that formed on the surface of the cathode protected the active methanogens from the alkaline environment according to carbon balance calculations co2 reduction rates corresponded with stepwise increases in influent cod 112 1 mol d m2 at 600 mg l 219 3 mol d m2 at 1200 mg l and 318 5 mol d m2 at 2400 mg l the higher ph also increased dissolution of co2 in the liquid phase which further improved biogas quality current density can be used to determine co2 reduction rates on the cathode van eerten jansen et al 2012 villano et al 2010 fig s2 current density during stage i was maintained at 3 77 10 5 a m2 and after influent loading increased during stage ii current density decreased to 2 42 10 5 a m2 and finally to 2 27 10 5 a m2 coulombic efficiencies of the three stages were 13 95 43 77 and 68 10 according to eq 2 this showed that more electrons from the cathode were used for co2 reduction when influent cod was high which is consistent with the finding that more co2 was reduced under high loading conditions 3 2 microbial community analysis similar to previous biogas upgrading det systems liu et al 2019 2020 the majority of archaeal sequences on the cathode surface were most similar to methanothrix species 92 7 fig 3 a in previous studies loading concentrations were significantly lower 600 mg l cod and methanothrix only accounted for 70 of the archaeal population liu et al 2019 influent acetate concentrations in this study were significantly higher 2400 mg l and this appeared to favor the growth of methanothrix on the cathode surface methanosarcina were also slightly enriched on the cathode surface 4 of the archaeal sequences and species from this genus have also been shown to participate in det bai et al 2020 rotaru et al 2014a yee et al 2019 bacteria from the genera rectinema ruminiclostridium anaerophaga lentimicrobium and actinobacillus dominated the cathode surface fig 3b most of these genera have been detected in other biogas producing reactors lackner et al 2020 lee et al 2013 solli et al 2014 tao et al 2020 tsavkelova et al 2018 and have fermentative metabolisms that produce end products that can be utilized by methanogens for co2 reduction denger et al 2002 desvaux 2005 kim et al 2020 schöck and perrimon 2002 sun et al 2016 in addition rectinema and ruminiclostridium species appear to be capable of acetate oxidation with methanogens lee et al 2013 zheng et al 2019 and actinobacillus can fix co2 thereby removing it from the gas phase and improving biogas quality gunnarsson et al 2014 zeikus et al 1999 therefore these bacteria were facilitating biogas upgrading indirectly through production of fermentation products and directly by forming syntrophic partnerships with methanogens in the reactor 3 3 transcription of genes from methanothrix expression of key genes coding for proteins involved in methanogenesis by methanothrix were monitored to gain insight into the physiology behind methane production in the mec fig 4 similar to our previous biogas upgrading study liu et al 2019 methanothrix cells growing on the cathode surface were expressing genes coding for proteins involved in det holmes et al 2018 at much high levels than methanothrix cells growing in the surrounding bulk sludge fpod 44 0 times greater hdra 13 0 times and hdrc 3 9 times fig 4 the mcra gene which is required for the final step of all methanogenic pathways holmes and smith 2016 also had 9 8 times higher transcript abundance in cells growing on the electrode compared to cells in the bulk sludge unlike the last study however the number of transcripts for genes coding for enzymes involved in acetate dismutation jetten et al 1990 maupin furlow and ferry 1996 including acs 1228 4 times and cdha 274 9 times were also higher in electrode grown methanothrix cells these results suggest that the increase in ch4 production could be attributed to both co2 reduction via det and acetoclastic methanogenesis by methanothrix 3 4 anns model of biogas upgrading via det a benchmark comparison antwi et al 2017 revealed that when 10 neurons were assigned minimum mse and maximum r2 values were obtained table 2 this optimum bp ann topology is shown in fig s3 the training completed after 17 iterations showed the best performance at 15 epoch with an mse of 6 06 10 3 as illustrated in fig s4 a the training state fig s4 b demonstrated that a well trained model was developed with gradient adaptive and validation check values at 17 epoch of 5 77 10 3 1 10 4 and 2 respectively the mathematical calculation used to determine ch4 yield y k 1 and ch4 yield via det y k 2 for the proposed bp ann models in matrix form mahmoodi babolan et al 2019 is provided in eq 8 8 y k 2 1 exp 2 w out k q t b out k y max k y min k

hidden layer xnor is the i dimensional normalized input vector namely xnor xnor 1 xnor i xnor 7 and ymax and ymin is maximum and minimum values over the whole range of the target data the optimum weights and biases are shown in table s2 the ch4 output under different loading conditions and the production of ch4 produced by co2 reduction were predicted with the developed bp ann model table s3 the model s performance on training validation test and all datasets had an r2 level of 0 99208 0 99210 0 91905 and 0 99008 respectively fig 5 these results showed that there was a good correlation between the predicted and experimental data yi fan et al 2017 the proposed ann model could accurately predict the production of ch4 produced by co2 reduction fig s5 which accounted for more than 12 of the total ch4 produced fig 6 the establishment of this model can be used to predict the ch4 output under different loads and also provide a reference for more complex biogas upgrading systems at a potential of 500 mv vs she the ch4 content after upgrading reached 97 0 fig 1a which was higher than many previously published bioelectrochemical methods liu et al 2020 xu et al 2014 and was also competitive compared with some physicochemical methods 96 abdeen et al 2016 muñoz et al 2015 although a previously described electromethanogenesis system produced biogas with 97 9 ch4 this system required a substantially higher energy input e g applied voltage 4 v which led to increased costs zhou et al 2020 alternatively the in situ biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical system reported in this study produces biogas of similar quality but with low energy input the biogas upgrading effect was more significant under higher organic loading rates although the increase in organic loading caused co2 conversion rates to decrease from 11 0 to 6 5 the ch4 content in the biogas still reached 97 and the co2 reduction rate increased to 318 5 mol d m2 the ch4 yield via det also increased from 1 07 mmol d to 4 62 mmol d accounted for 22 2 23 5 in the total ch4 yield it appears that higher concentrations of acetate enhanced both acetoclastic methanogenesis and electromethanogenesis carried out by methanothrix colonizing the cathode and it increased proton consumption by active methanogens creating a higher ph environment that increased the solubility of co2 in the bioreactor the purpose of this study was to optimize the biogas upgrading performance of methanothrix therefore acetate was the only electron donor provided in the feed stock reactors fed real wastewater will have much more complex organic compounds and although acetate is a major intermediate in these reactors other organic intermediates that will influence methanogenesis and biogas composition will also be present dang et al 2016 lei et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in addition alternate electron acceptors such as sulfate and nitrate would also be present in real wastewater and could influence methanogenesis by allowing growth of microbes that could compete with methanogens for substrate or generate products such as h2s nitrite or ammonia that are toxic to methanogens at elevated concentrations klüber and conrad 1998 stefanie et al 1994 the next step needed to ensure that this approach has real world applications is to test actual wastewater and these studies are underway one approach that might help solve some of these potential problems with complex wastewater is to use an ex situ biogas upgrading system xu et al 2014 in these systems the reactor is fed biogas generated by the anaerobic digestion of real organic wastewater thereby bypassing any inhibitory effects that components of complex wastewater might have on methanogenesis in the study conducted by xu et al 2014 this approach was not as efficient as in situ biogas upgrading however further optimization might be possible 4 conclusions in this study a high efficiency in situ biogas upgrading bio electrochemical system with low energy input was developed the bio electrochemical system was operated stably with an applied cathode potential of only 0 5 v vs she the ch4 content after upgrading reached 97 and co2 reduction rates were 318 5 mol d m2 acetoclastic methanogens from the genus methanothrix dominated 92 7 the cathode surface and highly expressed genes related to acetate dismutation and co2 reduction via det the high rate of electromethanogenesis via det also significantly increased proton consumption and created a higher ph that increased the solubility of co2 in the bioreactor which further increased ch4 content in the biogas a suitable ann model was proposed to predict the amount of ch4 production under different loading rates achieving a level of 0 99008 r2 both the operational and ann modeling results

17054,bioconversion of biogas to value added liquids has received increasing attention over the years however many biological processes are restricted under acidic conditions owing to the excessive carbon dioxide co2 30 40 v v in biogas here using an enriched culture dominated by acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob candidatus nitrosoglobus this study examined the feasibility of producing methanol from methane in the co2 acidified environment i e ph of 5 0 within the tested dissolved methane range 0 1 0 9 mm methane oxidation by the acid tolerant aob culture followed first order kinetics with the same rate constant i e 0 43 l g vss h between ph 7 0 and 5 0 the acidic methane oxidation showed robustness against high dissolved concentrations of co2 up to 4 06 mm and hydrogen sulfide h2s up to 0 11 mm which led to a high methanol yield of about 30 40 as such the raw biogas containing toxic co2 and h2s can directly serve for methanol production by this acid tolerant aob culture economizing a conventionally costly biogas upgradation process afterwards two batch reactors fed with methane and oxygen intermittently both obtained a final concentration of 1 5 mm ch3oh equal to 72 mg chemical oxygen demand l in the liquid suggesting it is a useful carbon source to enhance denitrification in wastewater treatment systems in addition ammonia availability was identified to be critical for a higher rate of this aob mediated methanol production overall our results for the first time demonstrated the capability of a novel acid tolerant aob culture to oxidize methane and also illustrated the technical feasibility to utilize raw biogas for methanol production at acidic conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane bioconversion to methanol ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob low ph biogas utilization candidatus nitrosoglobus 1 introduction biogas is one of the key products of anaerobic digestion a sustainable process for simultaneous generation of renewable energy and treatment of organic waste crone et al 2016 mccarty 2018 the estimated power generation from commercial biogas facilities can be doubled from 14 5 gigawatts in 2012 to 29 5 gigawatts in 2022 sun et al 2015 compared to the direct combustion of biogas to produce heat and energy the conversion of biogas to value added liquids e g methanol ch3oh through biological and chemical processes has recently attracted increasing attention because of the advantages in storing and transporting haynes and gonzalez 2014 cantera et al 2018 one of widely used physical chemical technologies is the fischer tropsch process in which biogas is upgraded to syngas firstly and subsequently converted to liquid hydrocarbons anderson et al 1984 however the chemical processes are generally capital and energy intensive requiring high temperature high pressure and costly catalysts wood et al 2012 as many biogas sources i e an anaerobic digester of a wastewater treatment plant or a landfill site are small and geographically scattered these chemical processes are not economically viable in contrast the biological processes which could be performed at ambient temperature and pressure are more favorable for the smaller distributed biogas sources conrado and gonzalez 2014 conventionally bioconversion of methane ch4 to methanol by aerobic methanotrophs was considered as a promising biological technology for biogas utilization sheets et al 2016 patel et al 2020a wang et al 2020a methanotrophs perform methane oxidation to methanol catalyzed by enzyme methane monooxygenase mmo however methanol can be further oxidized by methanol dehydrogenase mdh with carbon dioxide co2 as the final product during the methane oxidation process trotsenko and murrell 2008 semrau et al 2010 in order to increase the methanol yield mdh needs to be selectively suppressed by supplementing inhibitors such as edta high concentrations of phosphate nacl and mgcl2 han et al 2013 hur et al 2017 kim et al 2010 nevertheless it is difficult to maintain stable conversion of methane to methanol alternatively aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob have been proposed as another attractive candidate taher and chandran 2013 as the ammonia monooxygenase amo is phylogenetically similar to mmo holmes et al 1995 notably there is no identified gene for methanol metabolism in most of the reported genomes of aob chain et al 2003 stein et al 2007 therefore more stable methanol production and higher methanol yield are expected for aob compared to aerobic methanotrophs theoretically however because no energy is generated during the oxidation of methane to methanol by aob theoretically other substrates such as ammonia and hydroxylamine are needed in parallel to provide energy for the aob growth taher and chandran 2013 despite its attractiveness the feasibility of converting methane to methanol by aob has been reported in very few studies to date hyman and wood 1983 jones and morita 1983 taher and chandran 2013 su et al 2019 all of these previous studies were conducted under neutral ph conditions the fraction of methane in raw biogas is only about 60 while the rest including co2 40 and hydrogen sulfide h2s 1 are unwanted compounds sun et al 2015 excessive co2 in biogas usually results in a ph decrease down to 5 0 which is harmful to the activity of microorganisms living under neutral conditions claros et al 2013 sheets et al 2016 liu et al 2020b patel et al 2020b the dissolved h2s at low ph is toxic towards many bacteria e g aerobic methanotrophs and aob as well angelidaki et al 2018 xu et al 2020 therefore the raw biogas needs to be upgraded to biomethane or syngas before being used for energy generation and liquid chemicals production however the biogas upgradation is costly 0 1 0 5 eur m3 khan et al 2017 which will offset the benefits generated by biogas utilization as a consequence a biological process for raw biogas utilization is needed which should be robust under acidic conditions in this study we hypothesized that acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers are resistant towards acidic conditions due to the acidification of co2 contained in biogas thus posing an enhanced capability to directly utilize biogas for methanol production in particular with an isolate from an agricultural soil sample hayatsu et al 2017 identified a novel aob candidatus ca nitrosoglobus which was extremely tolerant of the acidic environment at ph 2 2 very recently we also enriched ca nitrosoglobus in a lab scale reactor by long term adapting activated sludge to a low ph level 4 5 5 0 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b it is expected that the unique acid tolerance renders ca nitrosoglobus a suitable candidate to utilize raw biogas for methanol generation the goal of this study is thus to examine the feasibility of converting methane into methanol under acidic conditions by an enriched acid tolerant ca nitrosoglobus culture the kinetics for methane oxidation by this aob culture was determined at neutral ph 7 0 and acidic ph 5 0 conditions respectively then at ph 5 0 the impacts of co2 and h2s in biogas on the methane oxidation performance and the methanol yield from methane oxidation were investigated comprehensively based on these results two laboratory batch reactors with the aob culture were established for methanol production this study proposes an alternative to directly convert raw biogas into value added chemical methanol which is of great significance to the future development of biogas based biotechnology 2 materials and methods 2 1 enriched acid tolerant aob culture the cultivation experiment was carried out in a 10 l membrane bioreactor mbr with a hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane 0 02 μm pore size and 0 03 m2 surface area module immersed inside the mbr was operated in a laboratory with controlled temperature 22 1 c the initial inoculum was 0 5 l biomass collected from an acidic ph 4 5 5 0 nitritation reactor which had treated real domestic sewage for over one year with stable nitrite accumulation ratio no2 no2 no3 above 95 and with a relative abundance of a novel aob ca nitrosoglobus of 1 90 0 08 to further enrich the acid tolerant aob the mbr was fed with synthetic wastewater containing per liter 900 mg of nh4hco3 160 mg of nh4 n 72 mg of nah2po4 72 mg of na2hpo4 184 mg of nacl 29 mg of kcl 35 mg of mgso4 7h2o and 0 3 ml of trace element stock solution prepared as described previously wang et al 2014 this gave 160 0 10 5 mg nh4 n l in influent it should be noted that the feeding did not contain any organic carbon matters hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt were fixed at 8 h and 10 d respectively the ph was maintained at 4 8 by dosing bicarbonate with a programmable logic controller the aeration was supplied with an air pump tetra whisper 60 at an air flow rate of 1 0 l min to mitigate the development of membrane fouling this led to a dissolved oxygen concentration as high as 6 8 mg o2 l in the mbr after 200 days of operation the mbr reached a steady state as indicated by a stable effluent quality including ammonium nitrite and nitrate of 58 2 4 6 mg nh4 n l 98 0 2 6 mg no2 n l and 2 3 0 4 mg no3 n l respectively thereafter triplicated biomass samples were collected for dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing both of which were performed by using a standard method detailed previously wang et al 2020b upon obtaining an enriched acid tolerant aob culture wang et al 2021b the biomass was collected to examine the feasibility of converting methane into methanol in the present study 2 2 experimental set up the overall experimental design was to investigate the bioconversion of methane to methanol by the enriched acid tolerant aob culture specifically the entire experiment consisted of three major parts i to compare methane oxidation rates at acidic and neutral ph ii to determine the effects of two dominating constituents in raw biogas i e co2 and h2s on methane oxidation rates and iii to estimate methanol yield from methane oxidation by the culture to achieve these purposes an unique experimental set up was designed using the vacuum sealed vessel with a total volume of 12 ml labco uk as shown in fig 1 briefly 100 ml of suspended biomass was collected from the mbr which was washed by deionized water for three times to deplete the residual nitrogenous compounds i e nh4 n no2 n and no3 n after centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min the biomass with a final volume of 4 ml was transferred into the vacuum sealed vessel to control the ph and test the impacts of different chemicals 4 ml of buffer solution and medium as detailed in table 1 was transferred into the vacuum sealed vessel as well at the same time a gas mixture of ch4 and o2 as detailed in table 1 was injected to provide essential substrates for methane oxidation finally the vessel was placed in a shaker guohua electricity hy 2a with a fixed speed of 150 rpm 22 c each test lasted for 1 6 h the gas samples before and after the test were collected for the analysis of ch4 content which also allowed the calculation of the dissolved ch4 concentration in the mixed liquor according to the henry s law as such the consumed ch4 was calculated as the difference of the total amount of gas and liquor ch4 between the beginning and the end of experiment the specific methane oxidation rate mmol ch4 g volatile suspended solids vss h was then calculated by the consumed ch4 divided the time h and the added biomass g vss in the vessel other compounds such as o2 and co2 in the gas samples and ammonium and methanol in the mixed liquor samples were also analyzed with methods described in section 2 4 all the methane oxidation experiments were performed based on this design while different gas mixture and buffer and medium solutions were applied to target respective purpose as summarized in table 1 taking methane oxidation tests at ph 5 0 as an example the experimental details were explained as follows firstly 4 ml concentrated biomass was added in each vessel then 4 ml 2 morpholinoethanesulfonic mes buffer at a concentration of 160 mm was added to control ph at 5 0 afterwards 2 0 ml of o2 was injected into the headspace together with different amount of ch4 0 4 ml 0 8 ml 1 2 ml 1 5 ml 1 9 ml and 2 4 ml methane oxidation rates and kinetics at ph 5 0 could be determined by using the differences of measured methane profiles between the initial and final concentrations in the experimental setup 2 3 estimation of methanol yield the estimation of methanol yield was conducted in five parallel tests using the same 12 ml vacuum vials in each vial 4 ml of concentrated biomass and 4 ml of mes buffer 80 mm were added initially controlling ph at 5 0 then 2 5 ml oxygen gas and 1 5 ml methane gas were injected leading to the dissolved oxygen and ch4 concentrations of 1 4 and 0 4 mmol l respectively the five tests lasted for 1 2 3 4 and 5 h respectively the contents of ch4 and o2 in gas samples and concentrations of ch3oh in liquid samples from the beginning and end of the test were analyzed the difference between them was used to calculate a methanol yield which is equal to a percentage of produced ch3oh in the total amount of ch4 consumed further another four tests were carried out to estimate the effects of different mdh inhibitors on the methanol yield the set up of these tests was the same as above with the exception of 25 mm nacl 10 mm mgcl2 1 mm edta and 40 mm kh2po4 initially added 2 4 fed batch production of methanol two batch reactors 150 ml each with different biomass concentrations 1 0 and 3 0 g vss l were established to produce methanol from methane using a fed batch mode the ch4 and o2 gasses were intermittently added during the experiment in order to maintain high dissolved ch4 and o2 concentrations in the mixed liquor the ph was controlled at 5 0 to mimic the acidification caused by excessive co2 in biogas while the reactor with biomass concentration of 1 0 g vss l was operated for 8 h the other with 3 0 g vss l biomass was operated for 26 h the gas and mixed liquor samples were regularly collected to monitor the ch4 and o2 contents in gas and ch3oh concentration in liquor notably a stock solution containing 10 mm ammonium as nh4cl was initially added this is based on the previous hypothesis that the addition of ammonium can promote methane oxidation by providing nitrogen source for biomass growth jones and morita 1983 as such the ammonium concentration was also analyzed in all liquor samples in addition a series of tests were conducted to examine the effects of ammonium and methanol on methane oxidation rates using the same methodology in section 2 2 as detailed in table 1 2 5 analytical methods the vss concentration was measured in accordance with the standard method apha 2005 for the analysis of nh4 n concentration 1 ml mixed liquor sample taken from the vacuum sealed vessel was filtered through a 0 22 μm millipore filter millex gp and then the filtrate was analysed using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsim ch4 co2 and o2 gasses 99 9 purity were used in this study coregas australia and their partial pressures in gas samples were measured using a gas chromatograph gc which was equipped with a porapak q column and a thermal conductivity detector shimadzu gc 8a japan the henry s law was applied to calculate the concentration of methane oxygen and carbon dioxide in liquid for methanol measurement liquid samples were harvested from vessels and then injected to the gc agilent technologies 7890a gc system equipped with db ffap column 30 m 0 53 mm 1 0 µm pn 125 3232 agilent the flame ionization detector fid was used with a flow of 10 ml min nitrogen gas the injection port temperature was 220 c and the oven temperature increased from 45 c to 170 c the temperature of the fid was set at 250 c and high purity helium was used as the carrier gas methanol concentrations were correlated with externally calibrated curve obtained using pure methanol 3 results 3 1 microbial communities of enriched aob culture the acid tolerant aob culture was cultivated in an aerobic mbr that was operated at ph 5 0 which was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater containing 160 0 10 5 mg nh4 n l without organic carbon in the steady state the specific ammonium oxidation rate of the biomass was determined to be 1 6 0 2 mmol nh4 g vss h microbial community structure revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed a remarkable dominance of a novel aob ca nitrosoglobus with relative abundance of 52 2 0 5 n 3 fig s1 in addition heterotrophic bacteria belonging to the genera riemerella mycobacterium ramlibacter and tubulinea were detected with average relative abundances of 10 1 0 5 7 8 0 8 5 7 0 1 and 4 2 0 6 respectively the results indicated the predominant enrichment of acid tolerant ca nitrosoglobus aob in the biomass 3 2 methane oxidation rate and kinetics the methane oxidation rates of the enriched aob ca nitrosoglobus culture were measured in the sealed vacuum vials in the presence of 0 11 mm dissolved ch4 but the absence of ammonium the specific methane oxidation rate was estimated to be 0 08 mmol ch4 g vss h fig 2 this rate gradually increased with the increasing dissolved ch4 concentration at 0 8 mm dissolved ch4 it reached approximate 0 4 mmol ch4 g vss h although the obtained methane oxidation rate is much less than the specific rate of ammonium oxidation i e 1 6 0 2 mmol nh4 g vss h these results demonstrated that the enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture was capable of oxidizing methane this is consistent with the previous perception that most of ammonia oxidizers should have the ability to oxidize methane jones and morita 1983 different from previous studies at neutral ph hyman and wood 1983 jones and morita 1983 taher and chandran 2013 su et al 2019 this study showed that the acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus maintained a high capacity of methane oxidation even in acidic environment at ph 5 0 moreover regression analyses revealed a linear relationship between the specific methane oxidation rate and the dissolved ch4 concentration fig 2 as a result the methane oxidation rate by the aob culture can be well described by the first order kinetics eq 1 in contrast the monod based equation eq 2 is widely used to illustrate the ammonia oxidation process wiesmann 1994 this difference suggests that amo has a much lower affinity for methane than mmo in the first order kinetics the constant value of k ch 4 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was determined to be the same as 0 43 l g vss h the results indicated that the enriched acid tolerant aob culture was able to oxidize methane in the low ph environment showing a capacity comparable to that at neutral ph 1 r c h 4 k ch 4 s c

have a high solubility in the aqueous solution resulting in the solution acidification and inhibition of microbial activity as such the effects of co2 and h2s on the methane oxidation activity of the enriched aob culture were investigated at ph 5 0 a broad range of dissolved co2 0 01 4 07 mm and h2s 0 0 27 mm concentrations was tested respectively both of which are at industrially relevant levels as shown in fig 3 a and b the relative decrease in the methane oxidation rate under these adverse conditions are insignificant p 0 05 for instance the specific methane oxidation rates only decreased by 19 23 when the dissolved co2 or h2s was at the maximum tested level further a fed batch experiment also confirms methanol production from the methane oxidation at ph 5 in the presence of both dissolved co2 4 06 mm and h2s 0 27 mm this phenomenon indicated that the enriched acid tolerant aob was robust against the co2 and h2s in raw biogas 3 4 estimation of methanol yield from methane oxidation methanol was hypothesized to be the product of methane oxidation by the amo of ammonia oxidizers jones and morita 1983 however the flanking partners in the enriched aob culture such as heterotrophic bacteria could utilize methanol indeed in the absence of methane the 0 54 mmol l methanol added to the culture was completely consumed in 5 h fig 4 a this gave a specific methanol consumption rate of around 0 11 mmol ch3oh g vss h which was lower than the methane oxidation rate at a dissolved ch4 concentration above 0 2 mmol l fig 2 therefore by measuring the methanol concentration in a 5 h test with dissolved ch4 concentration controlled at high as 0 4 mmol l the methanol yield was estimated the results showed that the methanol yield gradually increased and reached to around 30 in 5 h fig 4b demonstrating the accumulation of methanol from methane oxidation to further increase the methanol yield four typical mdh inhibitors were added in the enriched aob culture respectively including 25 mm nacl 10 mm mgcl2 1 mm edta and 40 mm kh2po4 which were shown to be able to increase methanol yield by aerobic methanotrophs ge et al 2014 however there was no significant change in the methanol yield 27 46 fig 4c 3 5 simultaneous ammonium oxidation and methanol production to shed light on the possibility of producing methanol from methane under acidic conditions two fed batch experiments with the respective biomass concentrations of 1 0 and 3 0 g vss l were carried out methane and oxygen gasses were intermittently supplied to maintain high dissolved ch4 0 4 0 8 mmol l and oxygen 1 0 1 5 mmol l concentrations in the liquid phase and 10 mmol l ammonium was added initially in order to provide nitrogen source for biomass growth in both examinations fig 5 a and b methanol accumulation together with simultaneous methane and ammonium oxidation at ph 5 0 were observed in the first 8 h intriguingly the methanol concentration increased and finally stabilized at a concentration of 1 5 mmol l in the 26 h experiment the ammonium oxidation occurred at a rate of 0 17 mmol nh4 g vss h which was substantially lower than the specific ammonium oxidation rate obtained in the mbr 1 6 0 2 mmol nh4 g vss h this result indicates the inhibited ammonium oxidation during the methane oxidation the inhibition might be due to multiple active sites involved in the ammonia oxygenase enzyme yet some of which can be inhibited by methane ward 1987 the specific methanol production rate was estimated to be around 0 16 mmol ch3oh g vss h fig 5a which was higher than the theoretical value of 0 05 mmol ch3oh g vss h k ch 4 c dissolved ch 4 yield 0 28 0 6 30 this higher methanol production rate could be likely due to the ammonium available during the experiment to confirm this assumption the effect of ammonium on the methane oxidation rate was further studied with the results presented in fig 6 a clearly the methane oxidation rate increased by 2 3 times with the ammonium concentration between 7 14 and 40 0 mm therefore ammonium availability was critical to the achievement of a higher rate of methanol production as a plateau of methanol concentration was observed during the experiment we hypothesized that the methane oxidation could possibly be inhibited by methanol at a high concentration to investigate the potential inhibition of methanol the methane oxidation at five different levels of methanol from 0 mm to 312 5 mm was examined as shown in fig 6b the specific methane oxidation rate only significantly p 0 05 decreased when the methanol concentration reached 31 2 mm which was substantially higher p 0 05 than that i e 1 5 mm obtained in the fed batch experiments this result indicated that methanol inhibition was unlikely responsible for the cease of methanol accumulation 4 discussion 4 1 methane oxidation to methanol by aob at acid conditions it has been well known that aob such as nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus can oxidize methane at neutral ph via amo catalysis hyman and wood 1983 jones and morita 1983 different from these previous reports this study for the first time illustrated that a novel aob ca nitrosoglobus enrichment can perform methane oxidation at acidic conditions i e ph 5 0 the results from comprehensive characterizations showed that the specific rate of methane oxidation 0 4 mmol ch4 g vss h by this novel aob was about four times less than that of ammonium oxidation 1 6 mmol nh4 g vss h likely due to a much lower affinity of amo to ch4 as such the first order kinetics can well describe the methane oxidation process of the enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture in the tested dissolved methane range 1 mm fig 1 this present study also showed that the aob ca nitrosoglobus could simultaneously oxidize methane and ammonium with comparable rates between them in the presence of methane ammonium and oxygen fig 4 particularly the ammonium oxidation rate was inhibited by 90 under this condition fig 4a while the presence of 10 mm ammonium could increase the methane oxidation rate by 2 3 times fig 5a in addition the methane oxidation activity of ca nitrosoglobus was found to be highly robust to high concentrations of dissolved co2 and h2s fig 2 consistent with the previous perception methanol was identified as the product of aob mediated methane oxidation fig 3b and c at ph 5 0 the specific methanol production rate of 0 16 mmol ch3oh g vss h was achieved fig 5a this rate is comparable to that attained by an enriched aob nitrosomonas culture at neutral ph taher and chandran 2013 notably most of the aerobic methanotrophs and aob prefer the neutral environment claros et al 2013 strong et al 2015 and their activities would substantially decrease in the low ph environment for example methylococcus capsulatus a typical aerobic methanotroph significantly lost its activity when ph was only slightly lower than 7 kolmert and johnson 2001 and the common aob nitrosomonas in activated sludge often cease their activity at ph 6 0 fumasoli et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 therefore the findings from this study suggest it is technically feasible to employ an acid tolerant aob culture to achieve biogas bioconversion to methanol at acid conditions 4 2 potential applications of methanol production from biogas by acid tolerant aob because of the high content of co2 40 the raw biogas is rarely being used as a direct feedstock to produce methanol khan et al 2017 instead a costly upgrading process is needed to remove co2 and to purify the biogas several previous studies have reported the negative effect of co2 on microbial activity when increasing the ratio of co2 to ch4 in gas supply the methanol production from methane by aerobic methanotrophs markedly declined because of the lowered ph induced by more co2 supplied sheets et al 2016 patel et al 2020a after replacing the biomethane 95 ch4 5 co2 with biogas 60 ch4 40 co2 the ph of a membrane biofilm reactor dramatically decreased from 7 0 to 5 4 leading to an immediate declined rate for nitrogen removal liu et al 2020b in this study the feasibility of using acid tolerant aob to convert methane into methanol under acidic conditions was evaluated the results showed that ca nitrosoglobus could successfully cope with co2 acidified environments fig 2a rendering this acid tolerant aob a suitable candidate for the application of methanol production from raw biogas indeed compared to the raw biogas methanol is a preferable energy source a major reason for the difficulty in utilizing biogas directly in practice is that biogas occurs as a gas at ambient condition which incur high cost for the storage and transportation sun et al 2015 more importantly being used as a fuel source the energy density of methanol 15 6 mj l 1 is two orders of magnitude higher than methane 36 6 10 3 mj l 1 in addition to being used as fuels methanol is also the most commonly used carbon source in the wastewater treatment process nyberg et al 1992 carrera et al 2003 the external addition of methanol can account up to 15 of the total cost in our local wwtps thus the technologies requiring less carbon consumption or utilizing a cheaper carbon source are of significance to decrease the overall cost for wastewater treatment hereby outcomes from this study propose feasibility to use raw biogas as a primary carbon source and methanol as the essential intermediate to drive nitrogen removal compared to other carbon sources the biogas is not only cheaper but also in situ available in wwtps liu et al 2020b conceptually methanol could be produced from raw biogas generated in anaerobic digester by the acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus which grows on ammonium as nitrogen source from the supernatant of anaerobic digestate based on this concept the nitrogen removal efficiency of a wwtp can be increased with the internal methanol produced while the overall cost for wastewater treatment could be saved while this is only a proof of concept study herein an additional experimental demonstration is expected to prove the entire concept in the future 4 3 prospects and future work though promising the proposed technology using acid tolerant aob to directly convert raw biogas into methanol still requires more investigations firstly how to deliver biogas and oxygen effectively is to be considered because methane is a poorly soluble gas it is of extreme importance to deliver it in an effective way liu et al 2014b meanwhile a rational oxygen supply is also critical to the success of methanol production as it determines the extent of methane conversion and could also strips dissolved methane into atmosphere unexpectedly non bubble gas supply from hollow fibres is a state of art technology which has been widely used as an effective method to increase gas transfer efficiency and to mitigate gas emission gong et al 2007 liu et al 2020a bunse et al 2020 thus perfectly matching the requirement of the present technology while the delivery of biogas can be enhanced significantly through the non porous hollow fibres the oxygen supplied via the same method will minimize the turbulence of liquid thus reducing methane emission in the off gas further studies are expected to demonstrate the methanol generation from raw biogas using hollow fibres to precisely regulate oxygen and biogas supply secondly the methanol yield i e 30 40 obtained in the present study is comparable to that achieved using chemical processes i e 20 50 periana et al 1993 hammond et al 2012 but only at the lowest limit of those i e 40 80 in literature using aerobic methanotrophs duan et al 2011 han et al 2013 hwang et al 2015 lee et al 2016 notably the addition of typical mdh inhibitors showed no significant improvement for the methanol yield in the present study fig 3 which is inconsistent with the previous study using aerobic methanotrophs han et al 2013 this was likely because these mdh inhibitors were ineffective to suppress methanol oxidation by the heterotrophic bacteria in the present enriched aob culture many previous studies have suggested that a limited oxygen condition is more favourable for methane conversion to organic intermediates werner and kayser 1991 thalasso et al 1997 waki et al 2005 liu et al 2014a chen et al 2019 yet a feasible path for oxygen control remains unclear which deserves further studies thirdly the present study demonstrated the generation of methanol in batch reactors intermittently fed with methane and oxygen fig 4 however the methanol ceased to further accumulate after reaching about 1 5 mm methanol inhibition on methane oxidation was previously proposed to primarily affect the methanol accumulation xin et al 2004 taher and chandran 2013 yet the inhibition at methanol concentration of 1 5 mm should not occur in this work as illustrated in fig 5b rather the reason might be related to free nitrous acid fna hno2 which is a potent biocide to many microorganisms duan et al 2020 the formation of hno2 was the resultant of ammonium oxidation at low ph no2 h hno2 in the fed batch experiments i e fig 5 hno2 concentration reached above 1 mg n l at ph 5 as a result of ammonium oxidation further study needs to reveal its exposure effect on methane oxidation activity of the enriched aob culture lastly it is essential to further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed technology in a more environmentally relevant condition apart from the major constituents tested in this study i e ch4 co2 and h2s there are other compounds existing in raw biogas at trace levels such as benzene and carbon monoxide khan et al 2017 as these compounds could potentially affect microbial activity a comprehensive study using real biogas is still needed moreover because of the requirement to manually add methane and oxygen the fed batch reactors with the biomass concentration of 1 0 g vss l and 3 0 g vss l have been only operated for 8 h and 26 h respectively a long term study is needed to prove that methanol could be continuously produced from methane under acidic condition 5 conclusions in this study the feasibility of producing methanol from methane under acidic condition i e ph 5 0 was examined using the enriched acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus the main conclusions and outcomes are the enriched acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus culture can oxidize methane to methanol the methane oxidation followed the first order kinetics 0 43 l g vss h in the tested methane range 1 mm with robust activity at both ph 7 0 and 5 0 the methane oxidation activity at ph 5 0 was robust against the increasing dissolved co2 0 01 4 07 mm and h2s 0 0 27 mm concentrations a methanol yield of 30 40 was achieved while the addition of typical mdh inhibitors did not show any significant promotion on the methanol yield the ammonium availability could accelerate the methane oxidation and methanol production likely because of providing nitrogen source for biomass growth and producing energy for microbial activity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17054,bioconversion of biogas to value added liquids has received increasing attention over the years however many biological processes are restricted under acidic conditions owing to the excessive carbon dioxide co2 30 40 v v in biogas here using an enriched culture dominated by acid tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob candidatus nitrosoglobus this study examined the feasibility of producing methanol from methane in the co2 acidified environment i e ph of 5 0 within the tested dissolved methane range 0 1 0 9 mm methane oxidation by the acid tolerant aob culture followed first order kinetics with the same rate constant i e 0 43 l g vss h between ph 7 0 and 5 0 the acidic methane oxidation showed robustness against high dissolved concentrations of co2 up to 4 06 mm and hydrogen sulfide h2s up to 0 11 mm which led to a high methanol yield of about 30 40 as such the raw biogas containing toxic co2 and h2s can directly serve for methanol production by this acid tolerant aob culture economizing a conventionally costly biogas upgradation process afterwards two batch reactors fed with methane and oxygen intermittently both obtained a final concentration of 1 5 mm ch3oh equal to 72 mg chemical oxygen demand l in the liquid suggesting it is a useful carbon source to enhance denitrification in wastewater treatment systems in addition ammonia availability was identified to be critical for a higher rate of this aob mediated methanol production overall our results for the first time demonstrated the capability of a novel acid tolerant aob culture to oxidize methane and also illustrated the technical feasibility to utilize raw biogas for methanol production at acidic conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane bioconversion to methanol ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob low ph biogas utilization candidatus nitrosoglobus 1 introduction biogas is one of the key products of anaerobic digestion a sustainable process for simultaneous generation of renewable energy and treatment of organic waste crone et al 2016 mccarty 2018 the estimated power generation from commercial biogas facilities can be doubled from 14 5 gigawatts in 2012 to 29 5 gigawatts in 2022 sun et al 2015 compared to the direct combustion of biogas to produce heat and energy the conversion of biogas to value added liquids e g methanol ch3oh through biological and chemical processes has recently attracted increasing attention because of the advantages in storing and transporting haynes and gonzalez 2014 cantera et al 2018 one of widely used physical chemical technologies is the fischer tropsch process in which biogas is upgraded to syngas firstly and subsequently converted to liquid hydrocarbons anderson et al 1984 however the chemical processes are generally capital and energy intensive requiring high temperature high pressure and costly catalysts wood et al 2012 as many biogas sources i e an anaerobic digester of a wastewater treatment plant or a landfill site are small and geographically scattered these chemical processes are not economically viable in contrast the biological processes which could be performed at ambient temperature and pressure are more favorable for the smaller distributed biogas sources conrado and gonzalez 2014 conventionally bioconversion of methane ch4 to methanol by aerobic methanotrophs was considered as a promising biological technology for biogas utilization sheets et al 2016 patel et al 2020a wang et al 2020a methanotrophs perform methane oxidation to methanol catalyzed by enzyme methane monooxygenase mmo however methanol can be further oxidized by methanol dehydrogenase mdh with carbon dioxide co2 as the final product during the methane oxidation process trotsenko and murrell 2008 semrau et al 2010 in order to increase the methanol yield mdh needs to be selectively suppressed by supplementing inhibitors such as edta high concentrations of phosphate nacl and mgcl2 han et al 2013 hur et al 2017 kim et al 2010 nevertheless it is difficult to maintain stable conversion of methane to methanol alternatively aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob have been proposed as another attractive candidate taher and chandran 2013 as the ammonia monooxygenase amo is phylogenetically similar to mmo holmes et al 1995 notably there is no identified gene for methanol metabolism in most of the reported genomes of aob chain et al 2003 stein et al 2007 therefore more stable methanol production and higher methanol yield are expected for aob compared to aerobic methanotrophs theoretically however because no energy is generated during the oxidation of methane to methanol by aob theoretically other substrates such as ammonia and hydroxylamine are needed in parallel to provide energy for the aob growth taher and chandran 2013 despite its attractiveness the feasibility of converting methane to methanol by aob has been reported in very few studies to date hyman and wood 1983 jones and morita 1983 taher and chandran 2013 su et al 2019 all of these previous studies were conducted under neutral ph conditions the fraction of methane in raw biogas is only about 60 while the rest including co2 40 and hydrogen sulfide h2s 1 are unwanted compounds sun et al 2015 excessive co2 in biogas usually results in a ph decrease down to 5 0 which is harmful to the activity of microorganisms living under neutral conditions claros et al 2013 sheets et al 2016 liu et al 2020b patel et al 2020b the dissolved h2s at low ph is toxic towards many bacteria e g aerobic methanotrophs and aob as well angelidaki et al 2018 xu et al 2020 therefore the raw biogas needs to be upgraded to biomethane or syngas before being used for energy generation and liquid chemicals production however the biogas upgradation is costly 0 1 0 5 eur m3 khan et al 2017 which will offset the benefits generated by biogas utilization as a consequence a biological process for raw biogas utilization is needed which should be robust under acidic conditions in this study we hypothesized that acid tolerant ammonia oxidizers are resistant towards acidic conditions due to the acidification of co2 contained in biogas thus posing an enhanced capability to directly utilize biogas for methanol production in particular with an isolate from an agricultural soil sample hayatsu et al 2017 identified a novel aob candidatus ca nitrosoglobus which was extremely tolerant of the acidic environment at ph 2 2 very recently we also enriched ca nitrosoglobus in a lab scale reactor by long term adapting activated sludge to a low ph level 4 5 5 0 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b it is expected that the unique acid tolerance renders ca nitrosoglobus a suitable candidate to utilize raw biogas for methanol generation the goal of this study is thus to examine the feasibility of converting methane into methanol under acidic conditions by an enriched acid tolerant ca nitrosoglobus culture the kinetics for methane oxidation by this aob culture was determined at neutral ph 7 0 and acidic ph 5 0 conditions respectively then at ph 5 0 the impacts of co2 and h2s in biogas on the methane oxidation performance and the methanol yield from methane oxidation were investigated comprehensively based on these results two laboratory batch reactors with the aob culture were established for methanol production this study proposes an alternative to directly convert raw biogas into value added chemical methanol which is of great significance to the future development of biogas based biotechnology 2 materials and methods 2 1 enriched acid tolerant aob culture the cultivation experiment was carried out in a 10 l membrane bioreactor mbr with a hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane 0 02 μm pore size and 0 03 m2 surface area module immersed inside the mbr was operated in a laboratory with controlled temperature 22 1 c the initial inoculum was 0 5 l biomass collected from an acidic ph 4 5 5 0 nitritation reactor which had treated real domestic sewage for over one year with stable nitrite accumulation ratio no2 no2 no3 above 95 and with a relative abundance of a novel aob ca nitrosoglobus of 1 90 0 08 to further enrich the acid tolerant aob the mbr was fed with synthetic wastewater containing per liter 900 mg of nh4hco3 160 mg of nh4 n 72 mg of nah2po4 72 mg of na2hpo4 184 mg of nacl 29 mg of kcl 35 mg of mgso4 7h2o and 0 3 ml of trace element stock solution prepared as described previously wang et al 2014 this gave 160 0 10 5 mg nh4 n l in influent it should be noted that the feeding did not contain any organic carbon matters hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt were fixed at 8 h and 10 d respectively the ph was maintained at 4 8 by dosing bicarbonate with a programmable logic controller the aeration was supplied with an air pump tetra whisper 60 at an air flow rate of 1 0 l min to mitigate the development of membrane fouling this led to a dissolved oxygen concentration as high as 6 8 mg o2 l in the mbr after 200 days of operation the mbr reached a steady state as indicated by a stable effluent quality including ammonium nitrite and nitrate of 58 2 4 6 mg nh4 n l 98 0 2 6 mg no2 n l and 2 3 0 4 mg no3 n l respectively thereafter triplicated biomass samples were collected for dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing both of which were performed by using a standard method detailed previously wang et al 2020b upon obtaining an enriched acid tolerant aob culture wang et al 2021b the biomass was collected to examine the feasibility of converting methane into methanol in the present study 2 2 experimental set up the overall experimental design was to investigate the bioconversion of methane to methanol by the enriched acid tolerant aob culture specifically the entire experiment consisted of three major parts i to compare methane oxidation rates at acidic and neutral ph ii to determine the effects of two dominating constituents in raw biogas i e co2 and h2s on methane oxidation rates and iii to estimate methanol yield from methane oxidation by the culture to achieve these purposes an unique experimental set up was designed using the vacuum sealed vessel with a total volume of 12 ml labco uk as shown in fig 1 briefly 100 ml of suspended biomass was collected from the mbr which was washed by deionized water for three times to deplete the residual nitrogenous compounds i e nh4 n no2 n and no3 n after centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min the biomass with a final volume of 4 ml was transferred into the vacuum sealed vessel to control the ph and test the impacts of different chemicals 4 ml of buffer solution and medium as detailed in table 1 was transferred into the vacuum sealed vessel as well at the same time a gas mixture of ch4 and o2 as detailed in table 1 was injected to provide essential substrates for methane oxidation finally the vessel was placed in a shaker guohua electricity hy 2a with a fixed speed of 150 rpm 22 c each test lasted for 1 6 h the gas samples before and after the test were collected for the analysis of ch4 content which also allowed the calculation of the dissolved ch4 concentration in the mixed liquor according to the henry s law as such the consumed ch4 was calculated as the difference of the total amount of gas and liquor ch4 between the beginning and the end of experiment the specific methane oxidation rate mmol ch4 g volatile suspended solids vss h was then calculated by the consumed ch4 divided the time h and the added biomass g vss in the vessel other compounds such as o2 and co2 in the gas samples and ammonium and methanol in the mixed liquor samples were also analyzed with methods described in section 2 4 all the methane oxidation experiments were performed based on this design while different gas mixture and buffer and medium solutions were applied to target respective purpose as summarized in table 1 taking methane oxidation tests at ph 5 0 as an example the experimental details were explained as follows firstly 4 ml concentrated biomass was added in each vessel then 4 ml 2 morpholinoethanesulfonic mes buffer at a concentration of 160 mm was added to control ph at 5 0 afterwards 2 0 ml of o2 was injected into the headspace together with different amount of ch4 0 4 ml 0 8 ml 1 2 ml 1 5 ml 1 9 ml and 2 4 ml methane oxidation rates and kinetics at ph 5 0 could be determined by using the differences of measured methane profiles between the initial and final concentrations in the experimental setup 2 3 estimation of methanol yield the estimation of methanol yield was conducted in five parallel tests using the same 12 ml vacuum vials in each vial 4 ml of concentrated biomass and 4 ml of mes buffer 80 mm were added initially controlling ph at 5 0 then 2 5 ml oxygen gas and 1 5 ml methane gas were injected leading to the dissolved oxygen and ch4 concentrations of 1 4 and 0 4 mmol l respectively the five tests lasted for 1 2 3 4 and 5 h respectively the contents of ch4 and o2 in gas samples and concentrations of ch3oh in liquid samples from the beginning and end of the test were analyzed the difference between them was used to calculate a methanol yield which is equal to a percentage of produced ch3oh in the total amount of ch4 consumed further another four tests were carried out to estimate the effects of different mdh inhibitors on the methanol yield the set up of these tests was the same as above with the exception of 25 mm nacl 10 mm mgcl2 1 mm edta and 40 mm kh2po4 initially added 2 4 fed batch production of methanol two batch reactors 150 ml each with different biomass concentrations 1 0 and 3 0 g vss l were established to produce methanol from methane using a fed batch mode the ch4 and o2 gasses were intermittently added during the experiment in order to maintain high dissolved ch4 and o2 concentrations in the mixed liquor the ph was controlled at 5 0 to mimic the acidification caused by excessive co2 in biogas while the reactor with biomass concentration of 1 0 g vss l was operated for 8 h the other with 3 0 g vss l biomass was operated for 26 h the gas and mixed liquor samples were regularly collected to monitor the ch4 and o2 contents in gas and ch3oh concentration in liquor notably a stock solution containing 10 mm ammonium as nh4cl was initially added this is based on the previous hypothesis that the addition of ammonium can promote methane oxidation by providing nitrogen source for biomass growth jones and morita 1983 as such the ammonium concentration was also analyzed in all liquor samples in addition a series of tests were conducted to examine the effects of ammonium and methanol on methane oxidation rates using the same methodology in section 2 2 as detailed in table 1 2 5 analytical methods the vss concentration was measured in accordance with the standard method apha 2005 for the analysis of nh4 n concentration 1 ml mixed liquor sample taken from the vacuum sealed vessel was filtered through a 0 22 μm millipore filter millex gp and then the filtrate was analysed using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsim ch4 co2 and o2 gasses 99 9 purity were used in this study coregas australia and their partial pressures in gas samples were measured using a gas chromatograph gc which was equipped with a porapak q column and a thermal conductivity detector shimadzu gc 8a japan the henry s law was applied to calculate the concentration of methane oxygen and carbon dioxide in liquid for methanol measurement liquid samples were harvested from vessels and then injected to the gc agilent technologies 7890a gc system equipped with db ffap column 30 m 0 53 mm 1 0 µm pn 125 3232 agilent the flame ionization detector fid was used with a flow of 10 ml min nitrogen gas the injection port temperature was 220 c and the oven temperature increased from 45 c to 170 c the temperature of the fid was set at 250 c and high purity helium was used as the carrier gas methanol concentrations were correlated with externally calibrated curve obtained using pure methanol 3 results 3 1 microbial communities of enriched aob culture the acid tolerant aob culture was cultivated in an aerobic mbr that was operated at ph 5 0 which was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater containing 160 0 10 5 mg nh4 n l without organic carbon in the steady state the specific ammonium oxidation rate of the biomass was determined to be 1 6 0 2 mmol nh4 g vss h microbial community structure revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed a remarkable dominance of a novel aob ca nitrosoglobus with relative abundance of 52 2 0 5 n 3 fig s1 in addition heterotrophic bacteria belonging to the genera riemerella mycobacterium ramlibacter and tubulinea were detected with average relative abundances of 10 1 0 5 7 8 0 8 5 7 0 1 and 4 2 0 6 respectively the results indicated the predominant enrichment of acid tolerant ca nitrosoglobus aob in the biomass 3 2 methane oxidation rate and kinetics the methane oxidation rates of the enriched aob ca nitrosoglobus culture were measured in the sealed vacuum vials in the presence of 0 11 mm dissolved ch4 but the absence of ammonium the specific methane oxidation rate was estimated to be 0 08 mmol ch4 g vss h fig 2 this rate gradually increased with the increasing dissolved ch4 concentration at 0 8 mm dissolved ch4 it reached approximate 0 4 mmol ch4 g vss h although the obtained methane oxidation rate is much less than the specific rate of ammonium oxidation i e 1 6 0 2 mmol nh4 g vss h these results demonstrated that the enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture was capable of oxidizing methane this is consistent with the previous perception that most of ammonia oxidizers should have the ability to oxidize methane jones and morita 1983 different from previous studies at neutral ph hyman and wood 1983 jones and morita 1983 taher and chandran 2013 su et al 2019 this study showed that the acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus maintained a high capacity of methane oxidation even in acidic environment at ph 5 0 moreover regression analyses revealed a linear relationship between the specific methane oxidation rate and the dissolved ch4 concentration fig 2 as a result the methane oxidation rate by the aob culture can be well described by the first order kinetics eq 1 in contrast the monod based equation eq 2 is widely used to illustrate the ammonia oxidation process wiesmann 1994 this difference suggests that amo has a much lower affinity for methane than mmo in the first order kinetics the constant value of k ch 4 at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was determined to be the same as 0 43 l g vss h the results indicated that the enriched acid tolerant aob culture was able to oxidize methane in the low ph environment showing a capacity comparable to that at neutral ph 1 r c h 4 k ch 4 s c

have a high solubility in the aqueous solution resulting in the solution acidification and inhibition of microbial activity as such the effects of co2 and h2s on the methane oxidation activity of the enriched aob culture were investigated at ph 5 0 a broad range of dissolved co2 0 01 4 07 mm and h2s 0 0 27 mm concentrations was tested respectively both of which are at industrially relevant levels as shown in fig 3 a and b the relative decrease in the methane oxidation rate under these adverse conditions are insignificant p 0 05 for instance the specific methane oxidation rates only decreased by 19 23 when the dissolved co2 or h2s was at the maximum tested level further a fed batch experiment also confirms methanol production from the methane oxidation at ph 5 in the presence of both dissolved co2 4 06 mm and h2s 0 27 mm this phenomenon indicated that the enriched acid tolerant aob was robust against the co2 and h2s in raw biogas 3 4 estimation of methanol yield from methane oxidation methanol was hypothesized to be the product of methane oxidation by the amo of ammonia oxidizers jones and morita 1983 however the flanking partners in the enriched aob culture such as heterotrophic bacteria could utilize methanol indeed in the absence of methane the 0 54 mmol l methanol added to the culture was completely consumed in 5 h fig 4 a this gave a specific methanol consumption rate of around 0 11 mmol ch3oh g vss h which was lower than the methane oxidation rate at a dissolved ch4 concentration above 0 2 mmol l fig 2 therefore by measuring the methanol concentration in a 5 h test with dissolved ch4 concentration controlled at high as 0 4 mmol l the methanol yield was estimated the results showed that the methanol yield gradually increased and reached to around 30 in 5 h fig 4b demonstrating the accumulation of methanol from methane oxidation to further increase the methanol yield four typical mdh inhibitors were added in the enriched aob culture respectively including 25 mm nacl 10 mm mgcl2 1 mm edta and 40 mm kh2po4 which were shown to be able to increase methanol yield by aerobic methanotrophs ge et al 2014 however there was no significant change in the methanol yield 27 46 fig 4c 3 5 simultaneous ammonium oxidation and methanol production to shed light on the possibility of producing methanol from methane under acidic conditions two fed batch experiments with the respective biomass concentrations of 1 0 and 3 0 g vss l were carried out methane and oxygen gasses were intermittently supplied to maintain high dissolved ch4 0 4 0 8 mmol l and oxygen 1 0 1 5 mmol l concentrations in the liquid phase and 10 mmol l ammonium was added initially in order to provide nitrogen source for biomass growth in both examinations fig 5 a and b methanol accumulation together with simultaneous methane and ammonium oxidation at ph 5 0 were observed in the first 8 h intriguingly the methanol concentration increased and finally stabilized at a concentration of 1 5 mmol l in the 26 h experiment the ammonium oxidation occurred at a rate of 0 17 mmol nh4 g vss h which was substantially lower than the specific ammonium oxidation rate obtained in the mbr 1 6 0 2 mmol nh4 g vss h this result indicates the inhibited ammonium oxidation during the methane oxidation the inhibition might be due to multiple active sites involved in the ammonia oxygenase enzyme yet some of which can be inhibited by methane ward 1987 the specific methanol production rate was estimated to be around 0 16 mmol ch3oh g vss h fig 5a which was higher than the theoretical value of 0 05 mmol ch3oh g vss h k ch 4 c dissolved ch 4 yield 0 28 0 6 30 this higher methanol production rate could be likely due to the ammonium available during the experiment to confirm this assumption the effect of ammonium on the methane oxidation rate was further studied with the results presented in fig 6 a clearly the methane oxidation rate increased by 2 3 times with the ammonium concentration between 7 14 and 40 0 mm therefore ammonium availability was critical to the achievement of a higher rate of methanol production as a plateau of methanol concentration was observed during the experiment we hypothesized that the methane oxidation could possibly be inhibited by methanol at a high concentration to investigate the potential inhibition of methanol the methane oxidation at five different levels of methanol from 0 mm to 312 5 mm was examined as shown in fig 6b the specific methane oxidation rate only significantly p 0 05 decreased when the methanol concentration reached 31 2 mm which was substantially higher p 0 05 than that i e 1 5 mm obtained in the fed batch experiments this result indicated that methanol inhibition was unlikely responsible for the cease of methanol accumulation 4 discussion 4 1 methane oxidation to methanol by aob at acid conditions it has been well known that aob such as nitrosomonas and nitrosococcus can oxidize methane at neutral ph via amo catalysis hyman and wood 1983 jones and morita 1983 different from these previous reports this study for the first time illustrated that a novel aob ca nitrosoglobus enrichment can perform methane oxidation at acidic conditions i e ph 5 0 the results from comprehensive characterizations showed that the specific rate of methane oxidation 0 4 mmol ch4 g vss h by this novel aob was about four times less than that of ammonium oxidation 1 6 mmol nh4 g vss h likely due to a much lower affinity of amo to ch4 as such the first order kinetics can well describe the methane oxidation process of the enriched ca nitrosoglobus culture in the tested dissolved methane range 1 mm fig 1 this present study also showed that the aob ca nitrosoglobus could simultaneously oxidize methane and ammonium with comparable rates between them in the presence of methane ammonium and oxygen fig 4 particularly the ammonium oxidation rate was inhibited by 90 under this condition fig 4a while the presence of 10 mm ammonium could increase the methane oxidation rate by 2 3 times fig 5a in addition the methane oxidation activity of ca nitrosoglobus was found to be highly robust to high concentrations of dissolved co2 and h2s fig 2 consistent with the previous perception methanol was identified as the product of aob mediated methane oxidation fig 3b and c at ph 5 0 the specific methanol production rate of 0 16 mmol ch3oh g vss h was achieved fig 5a this rate is comparable to that attained by an enriched aob nitrosomonas culture at neutral ph taher and chandran 2013 notably most of the aerobic methanotrophs and aob prefer the neutral environment claros et al 2013 strong et al 2015 and their activities would substantially decrease in the low ph environment for example methylococcus capsulatus a typical aerobic methanotroph significantly lost its activity when ph was only slightly lower than 7 kolmert and johnson 2001 and the common aob nitrosomonas in activated sludge often cease their activity at ph 6 0 fumasoli et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 therefore the findings from this study suggest it is technically feasible to employ an acid tolerant aob culture to achieve biogas bioconversion to methanol at acid conditions 4 2 potential applications of methanol production from biogas by acid tolerant aob because of the high content of co2 40 the raw biogas is rarely being used as a direct feedstock to produce methanol khan et al 2017 instead a costly upgrading process is needed to remove co2 and to purify the biogas several previous studies have reported the negative effect of co2 on microbial activity when increasing the ratio of co2 to ch4 in gas supply the methanol production from methane by aerobic methanotrophs markedly declined because of the lowered ph induced by more co2 supplied sheets et al 2016 patel et al 2020a after replacing the biomethane 95 ch4 5 co2 with biogas 60 ch4 40 co2 the ph of a membrane biofilm reactor dramatically decreased from 7 0 to 5 4 leading to an immediate declined rate for nitrogen removal liu et al 2020b in this study the feasibility of using acid tolerant aob to convert methane into methanol under acidic conditions was evaluated the results showed that ca nitrosoglobus could successfully cope with co2 acidified environments fig 2a rendering this acid tolerant aob a suitable candidate for the application of methanol production from raw biogas indeed compared to the raw biogas methanol is a preferable energy source a major reason for the difficulty in utilizing biogas directly in practice is that biogas occurs as a gas at ambient condition which incur high cost for the storage and transportation sun et al 2015 more importantly being used as a fuel source the energy density of methanol 15 6 mj l 1 is two orders of magnitude higher than methane 36 6 10 3 mj l 1 in addition to being used as fuels methanol is also the most commonly used carbon source in the wastewater treatment process nyberg et al 1992 carrera et al 2003 the external addition of methanol can account up to 15 of the total cost in our local wwtps thus the technologies requiring less carbon consumption or utilizing a cheaper carbon source are of significance to decrease the overall cost for wastewater treatment hereby outcomes from this study propose feasibility to use raw biogas as a primary carbon source and methanol as the essential intermediate to drive nitrogen removal compared to other carbon sources the biogas is not only cheaper but also in situ available in wwtps liu et al 2020b conceptually methanol could be produced from raw biogas generated in anaerobic digester by the acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus which grows on ammonium as nitrogen source from the supernatant of anaerobic digestate based on this concept the nitrogen removal efficiency of a wwtp can be increased with the internal methanol produced while the overall cost for wastewater treatment could be saved while this is only a proof of concept study herein an additional experimental demonstration is expected to prove the entire concept in the future 4 3 prospects and future work though promising the proposed technology using acid tolerant aob to directly convert raw biogas into methanol still requires more investigations firstly how to deliver biogas and oxygen effectively is to be considered because methane is a poorly soluble gas it is of extreme importance to deliver it in an effective way liu et al 2014b meanwhile a rational oxygen supply is also critical to the success of methanol production as it determines the extent of methane conversion and could also strips dissolved methane into atmosphere unexpectedly non bubble gas supply from hollow fibres is a state of art technology which has been widely used as an effective method to increase gas transfer efficiency and to mitigate gas emission gong et al 2007 liu et al 2020a bunse et al 2020 thus perfectly matching the requirement of the present technology while the delivery of biogas can be enhanced significantly through the non porous hollow fibres the oxygen supplied via the same method will minimize the turbulence of liquid thus reducing methane emission in the off gas further studies are expected to demonstrate the methanol generation from raw biogas using hollow fibres to precisely regulate oxygen and biogas supply secondly the methanol yield i e 30 40 obtained in the present study is comparable to that achieved using chemical processes i e 20 50 periana et al 1993 hammond et al 2012 but only at the lowest limit of those i e 40 80 in literature using aerobic methanotrophs duan et al 2011 han et al 2013 hwang et al 2015 lee et al 2016 notably the addition of typical mdh inhibitors showed no significant improvement for the methanol yield in the present study fig 3 which is inconsistent with the previous study using aerobic methanotrophs han et al 2013 this was likely because these mdh inhibitors were ineffective to suppress methanol oxidation by the heterotrophic bacteria in the present enriched aob culture many previous studies have suggested that a limited oxygen condition is more favourable for methane conversion to organic intermediates werner and kayser 1991 thalasso et al 1997 waki et al 2005 liu et al 2014a chen et al 2019 yet a feasible path for oxygen control remains unclear which deserves further studies thirdly the present study demonstrated the generation of methanol in batch reactors intermittently fed with methane and oxygen fig 4 however the methanol ceased to further accumulate after reaching about 1 5 mm methanol inhibition on methane oxidation was previously proposed to primarily affect the methanol accumulation xin et al 2004 taher and chandran 2013 yet the inhibition at methanol concentration of 1 5 mm should not occur in this work as illustrated in fig 5b rather the reason might be related to free nitrous acid fna hno2 which is a potent biocide to many microorganisms duan et al 2020 the formation of hno2 was the resultant of ammonium oxidation at low ph no2 h hno2 in the fed batch experiments i e fig 5 hno2 concentration reached above 1 mg n l at ph 5 as a result of ammonium oxidation further study needs to reveal its exposure effect on methane oxidation activity of the enriched aob culture lastly it is essential to further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed technology in a more environmentally relevant condition apart from the major constituents tested in this study i e ch4 co2 and h2s there are other compounds existing in raw biogas at trace levels such as benzene and carbon monoxide khan et al 2017 as these compounds could potentially affect microbial activity a comprehensive study using real biogas is still needed moreover because of the requirement to manually add methane and oxygen the fed batch reactors with the biomass concentration of 1 0 g vss l and 3 0 g vss l have been only operated for 8 h and 26 h respectively a long term study is needed to prove that methanol could be continuously produced from methane under acidic condition 5 conclusions in this study the feasibility of producing methanol from methane under acidic condition i e ph 5 0 was examined using the enriched acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus the main conclusions and outcomes are the enriched acid tolerant aob ca nitrosoglobus culture can oxidize methane to methanol the methane oxidation followed the first order kinetics 0 43 l g vss h in the tested methane range 1 mm with robust activity at both ph 7 0 and 5 0 the methane oxidation activity at ph 5 0 was robust against the increasing dissolved co2 0 01 4 07 mm and h2s 0 0 27 mm concentrations a methanol yield of 30 40 was achieved while the addition of typical mdh inhibitors did not show any significant promotion on the methanol yield the ammonium availability could accelerate the methane oxidation and methanol production likely because of
