7465,soil and water loss from farmland causes land degradation and water pollution thus continued efforts are needed to establish mathematical model for quantitative analysis of relevant processes and mechanisms in this study an approximate analytical solution has been developed for overland flow model and sediment transport model offering a simple and effective means to predict overland flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions in the overland flow model the flow regime was considered to be transitional with the value of parameter β in the kinematic wave model approximately two the change rate of unit discharge with distance was assumed to be constant and equal to the runoff rate at the outlet of the plane the excess rainfall was considered to be constant under uniform rainfall conditions the overland flow model developed can be further applied to natural rainfall conditions by treating excess rainfall intensity as constant over a small time interval for the sediment model the recommended values of the runoff erosion calibration constant cr and the splash erosion calibration constant cf have been given in this study so that it is easier to use the model these recommended values are 0 15 and 0 12 respectively comparisons with observed results were carried out to validate the proposed analytical solution the results showed that the approximate analytical solution developed in this paper closely matches the observed data thus providing an alternative method of predicting runoff generation and sediment yield and offering a more convenient method of analyzing the quantitative relationships between variables furthermore the model developed in this study can be used as a theoretical basis for developing runoff and erosion control methods keywords overland flow soil erosion approximate analytical solution natural rainfall 1 introduction soil erosion and nutrient loss caused by rainfall contribute significantly to land degradation and nonpoint source pollution the processes of runoff generation and soil erosion need to be better understood and quantified predicting rainfall runoff is critical in predicting soil erosion raff and ramirez 2005 mathematical models related to runoff generation and sediment transport have been used as an effective way of predicting soil and water loss during rainfall with the process of overland flow generation usually described using saint venant equations i e the continuity equation and the momentum equation wang et al 2002 however it is very difficult to obtain analytical solutions as these equations are highly nonlinear wang et al 2006 meaning that only numerical techniques can be used ying et al 2004 crossley et al 2003 lackey and sotiropoulos 2005 when the acceleration term is ignored the saint venant equations can be simplified using diffusion wave equations hayami 1951 developed an analytical solution for diffusion wave equations in rivers by using a disturbance function kazeyilmaz ahan and medina 2007 and kazeyilmaz ahan 2012 provided a solution for overland flow then improved the solution for diffusion waves applied to overland flow by employing the de hoog algorithm govindaraju et al 1988 and rao and kavvas 1991 suggested that diffusion wave equations may be better suited to steep rough slopes when the acceleration and pressure terms are ignored the saint venant equations can be expressed as kinematic wave equations the explicit analytical solution for uniform rainfall in time and space to kinematic wave equations was first given by henderson and wooding 1964 parlange et al 1981 developed a general analytical solution to the kinematic flow for variable rainfall sander et al 1990 obtained the solution for when infiltration rate exceeds rainfall intensity by considering the excess rainfall to be equal to the hydraulic conductivity luce and cundy 1992 modified the kinematic wave equation by using the philips infiltration equation to predict excess rainfall and applied the solution to field data tsai and yang 2005 used the method of characteristics integrated with cubic spline interpolation to compute one dimensional and two dimensional kinematic wave models to obtain the closed form of the analytical solution mizumura 2006 assumed that the unit discharge in manning s formula was a parabolic curve gottardi and venutelli 2008 suggested an accurate time integration method for diffusion wave and kinematic wave equations morooka et al 2016 proposed a new theoretical framework theory of stochastic process to estimate rainfall runoff foster 1986 defined detachment as the soil particles being removed from the soil surface and transport as the detached soil particles moving to some location away from the detachment point the processes of detachment and transport can be described using the continuity equation with sediment discharge considered to be a function of water flow soil properties and topography bennet 1974 most of the physical model developed in this study was based on the continuity equation the answers areal nonpoint source watershed response simulation model was used to predict erosion of agricultural watersheds by treating runoff and erosion as independent processes beasley et al 1980 the weep water erosion prediction project model nearing et al 1989 divides rainfall erosion into rill and interrill areas and calculates the erosion in these areas separately eurosem euro open soil erosion model morgan et al 1998 is an event based model which assumes that a few events every year are the main contributors to erosion it also calculates rill erosion and interrill erosion separately for this paper an approximate analytical model for predicting overland flow and rainfall erosion was developed the overland flow model was then used to predict flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions the recommended values for the runoff erosion calibration and splash erosion calibration constants are defined in this paper producing a simple and effective model for predicting overland flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 overland flow the kinematic wave model was used to describe the process of overland flow generation 1 q x t x h x t t r e t 2 q x t α h x t β where q x t is the unit discharge cm2 min h x t is the depth of overland

discharge per unit area at the outlet of the plane moore 1985 agnese et al 2001 the unit discharge can be expressed as 3 q x t q t x where q t is the discharge per unit area cm min combining eqs 2 and

in order to obtain an approximate solution under uniform rainfall conditions it is necessary to estimate accurately the parameters particularly β which reflects the degree of turbulence and the type of flow regime that the overland flow belongs to in this research the flow regime is treated as transitional with the value of β approximated to be two horton 1938 agnese et al 2001 singh 2002 in addition the excess rainfall under uniform rainfall intensity conditions was considered to be a constant i e rainfall intensity minus stable infiltration rate when obtaining the solution to the integration of eq 10 agnese et al 2001 moore 1985 then eq 10 can be approximated as 11 t t p 1 3 l α 1 2 q t p q t q t 1 2 r e q t dq t hence for uniform rainfall intensity the outflow rate in the rising stage can be expressed as 12 q t tanh 2 3 2 α r e l t t p r e the unit discharge and flow depth in the rising stage can be expressed as 13 q x t tanh 2 3 2 α r e l t t p r e x 14 h x t r e x α

in a rainfall event cm using the parameters shown in table 1 the unit discharge on the slope was simulated for three rainfall intensities three slope lengths and three values of parameter α examples a b and c fig 1 shows the calculated results using eq 17 for unit discharge the simulated results show that the analytical solutions have a good performance in describing the processes of runoff generation note that the increasing values of α results in an increased unit discharge the values of α are affected by slope gradient and the roughness coefficient therefore fig 1c shows the comprehensive effects of slope gradients and roughness coefficients 2 1 2 the approximate solution under natural rainfall conditions the natural rainfall process does not result in absolutely uniform rainfall intensity thus the application of the approximate solution under natural rainfall conditions needs to be further analyzed the natural rainfall process can be divided into several events based on the rainfall intensity assuming q t 0 q 0 t 0 is any time during the rainfall event the excess rainfall can be considered constant over a small time interval t 0 t there are then some different cases to be examined case 1 re q 0 in this case the integration of eq 10 gives 20 t t 0 2 3 l α r e arctanh q t r e arctanh q 0 r e the solution of eq 20 is 21 q t tanh 2 arctanh q 0 r e 3 2 α r e l t

following example demonstrates the analytical solution given continuous rainfall for 20 min over a 1000 cm long slope at a rainfall intensity of 0 2 cm min decreasing to 0 1 cm min for the next 20 min and α assumed to be 100 fig 2 shows the simulated results for unit discharge runoff depth and runoff amount the first rainfall stage 0 t 20 was modeled using eqs 22 24 with the second rainfall stage 20 t 40 modeled using eqs 27 29 the recession stage was modeled using eqs 32 34 2 1 3 comparison with another analytical solution cevza and miguel 2007 described an analytical solution to the kinematic wave equation kw and diffusion wave equation dw with constant wave celerity and hydraulic diffusivity applied to the overland flow problem two examples a and b provided in cevza and miguel 2007 were used to make a comparison with the parameters used listed in table 2 the simulated results of the solutions are listed in fig 3 as can be seen from the figures there are some differences among these solutions comparing the curves in fig 3a the results show different behaviors at peak flow and the recession stage the kw cevza reaches a maximum runoff rate for a sustained time the kw this study and the dw cevza have smaller peaks than given by the kw cevza the kw this study decreases more rapidly in the recession stage than either of the kw cevza and dw cevza in fact this an expected as it would then better reflect the actual situation fig 3b shows the analytical solution for runoff rate under variable rainfall intensity conditions the kw this study agrees reasonably well with the kw cevza and dw cevza for the first period of the rainfall but not well for the second period of rainfall the kw this study and dw cevza have smaller and smoother peaks than the kw cevza the results of the kw this study under variable rainfall conditions are similar to those of the dw cevza thus the kw this study can better reflect the actual situation and has fewer unknown parameters cevza s method requires the determination of the constant celerity and hydraulic diffusivity 2 2 sediment transport the process of sediment transport under rainfall conditions is usually described using the sediment continuity equation soil erosion on a sloped land can be divided into splash erosion and runoff erosion thomas and wesley 1994 and can be expressed as 35 s x t h x t t s x t q x t x c f ρ γ jh x t c r ρ r 2 where s x t is the sediment concentration g cm3 γ is density of water g cm3 ρ is the bulk density of soil g cm3 r is the actual received rainfall intensity on unit soil surface cm min cf is the calibration constant of runoff erosion g min cm3 and cr is the calibration constant of splash erosion g2 min cm7 as is well known the infiltration capacity of soil rapidly decreases at the start of rainfall then the infiltration rate will tend to stabilize hence the discharge and the runoff depth will tend to stabilize as well this results in the erosion caused by rainfall and runoff changing very little in this stable stage therefore the rate of change of sediment over time in the stable stage has been ignored in this research foster and meyer 1972 beasley et al 1980 yu 2003 thus eq 35 can be approximated as follows 36 s x t q x t x c f ρ γ jh x t c r ρ r 2 2 2 1 sediment transport under uniform rainfall conditions the solutions for variables q and h have been given in the previous section based on eqs 13 14 and 36 the sediment concentration in runoff water can be expressed as 37 s x t 2 tanh 3 2 α r e l t t p c f γ j r e x α 3 c r r 2 3 ρ r e tanh 2 3

based on eqs 17 18 and 36 the sediment concentration during the recession stage can be expressed as 39 s r x t 1 6 c f γ j l α q t s ρ q t s 3 2 α q t s l t t s 1 where sr x t is the sediment concentration during the recession stage g cm3 combining eqs 16 and 39 the sediment yield rate in recession stage can be expressed as 40 s r x t 1 6 c f γ j l α q t s ρ 3 2 α q t s l t t s 1 3 where sr x t is the sediment yield rate during the recession stage g min cm2 integrating eqs 38 and 40 with respect to time yields the sediment load yield per unit area 41a m t 2 3 c f γ j ρ r e l α c r r 2

1 sediment transport in the runoff was simulated for three rainfall intensities three slope lengths and three values of parameter α example a b and c in addition the sediment transport was also simulated for different overland slope as the parameter j appears separately in the solutions of sediment transport equations the parameter j was specified as 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 and the soil bulk density and manning s roughness coefficient were specified as 1 40 g cm3 and 0 05 s m1 3 respectively the simulated results in fig 4 show that the analytical solutions describe the processes of sediment transport well as can be seen from fig 4 increasing rainfall intensity slope length and overland slope result in an increase in sediment yield rate conversely however increasing values of α result in a decrease in sediment yield rate 2 2 2 sediment transport under natural rainfall conditions combining the solutions for runoff generation under natural rainfall conditions with eq 36 there are then three different cases to be examined case 1 re q 0 combining eqs 22 23 and 36 the solution of eq 36 is given by 42 s x t 2 tanh arctanh q 0 r e 3 2 α r e l t t 0 c f γ j r e x α 3 c r r 2 3 ρ

analytical solution for sediment transport under variable rainfall conditions given continuous rainfall for 20 min over a 1000 cm long slope at a rainfall intensity of 0 2 cm min decreasing 0 1 cm min for the next 20 min and a value of α was assumed to be 100 fig 5 shows the simulated results for sediment yield rate and sediment load per unit area the first rainfall stage 0 t 20 was modeled using eqs 43 and 44 with the second rainfall stage 20 t 40 modeled using eqs 46 and 47 the recession stage was modeled using eqs 49 and 50 3 materials and methods 3 1 rainfall simulations eighty four rainfall events from published results see details in table 3 were used to verify the accuracy of our analytical solutions these rainfall events occurred under various conditions such as different slope lengths from 1 to 22 m slope gradients from 0 02 to 0 78 soil bulk densities from 1 20 to1 6 g cm3 stable infiltration rates from 0 0045 to 0 094 cm min rainfall intensities from 0 04 to 0 28 cm min rainfall durations from 30 to 408 min and manning roughness coefficients from 0 00004 to 0 0068 min cm1 3 rainfall events 1 3 were used to verify the analytical solution of runoff generation under uniform rainfall conditions the experimental data were collected from wang et al 2015 liu and singh 2004 and tao and wu 2015 for events 1 and 3 respectively events 1 and 2 were conducted in the rainfall simulation hall at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau and event 3 was carried out at the changwu state key agro experimental station on the loess plateau the test soils were loess rainfall intensities were 0 2 0 16 and 0 167 cm min slope lengths were 5 3 3 2 and 1 m and soil bulk densities were 1 6 1 35 and 1 31 g cm3 rainfall events 4 6 were used to verify the analytical solution of runoff generation under natural rainfall conditions the experimental data were obtained from lloyd and tommy 2010 and the experiments were conducted in an outdoor experimental station at nanyang technological university the experimental plots were 25 m long and 1 m wide and were equipped with rainfall and flow measurement devices the overland plane had a slope of 0 02 the three rainfall storm events used occurred between october 2002 and december 2002 the changes in rainfall intensity during natural rainfall are shown in fig 6 rainfall events 7 78 were used to determine the parameters cf the calibration constant of runoff erosion and cr the calibration constant of splash erosion the treatments were different slope lengths xing et al 2016 different rainfall intensities dong et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 different slope gradients he et al 2016 shen et al 2016 and different rainfall durations catherine et al 2010 five types of soil were selected for these experiments being sandy sandy loam clay loam silt loam and silt clay rainfall events 79 81 were used to verify the process of sediment yield under uniform rainfall conditions the experimental data were obtained from zhao et al 2015 the experiments were conducted in the simulated hall at the red soil erosion and flow hydraulics of south china in guangzhou city the test used red soil taken from the non agricultural land located in a guangzhou suburb rainfall intensities used were 0 15 0 2 and 0 3 cm min the slope length was 2 m and the slope gradient was 0 42 rainfall events 82 84 were used to verify the process of sediment yield under natural rainfall conditions the experimental data were obtained from zhang et al 2008 the experiments were conducted in the soil conservation ecological science and technology demonstration park of jiangxi province the slope grade used was 12 and the slope length was 22 m the testing plot was located below the uncovered slope the changes in intensity during rainfall are shown in fig 7 3 2 data analysis the agreement between the observed and calculated data was assessed using rmse root mean square error and r2 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient 51 rmse i n o i c i 2 n 52 r 2 1 i 1 n o i c i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is the observed data ci is the calculated data n is the number of measurement and o is the mean value of observed data 4 results and discussion 4 1 overland flow three rainfall events rainfall events 1 3 were used to verify the accuracy of the approximate solution under uniform rainfall conditions the observed unit discharge was fitted with the data calculated from the approximate solution eqs 13 and 17 as shown in fig 8 it shows that the approximate solution overestimated the unit discharge at the initial stage but predicted well at the steady stage the reason for the overestimated unit discharge is mainly because that the rainfall intensity was considered as being constant in the overland flow however rainfall events can last a long time and the soil infiltration capacity rapidly decreases during the initial stage hence the approximation of the rainfall intensity may give a slightly larger runoff value than the actual one but have no significant effect on the total runoff the rmse for the three rainfall events was 1 16 0 65 and 0 93 respectively and r2 was 0 81 0 92 and 0 74 respectively it can be concluded that the approximate solution can be used to predict the unit discharge reasonably accurately another three rainfall events rainfall events 4 6 were used to verify the accuracy of the approximate solution under natural rainfall conditions as shown in fig 9 which shows the observed runoff rate curve fitted to the approximate solution eqs 21 26 and 31 the rmse of the three rainfall events was 0 028 0 032 and 0 041 respectively and the r2 of the three rainfall events was 0 91 0 89 and 0 86 respectively the results indicated that the approximate solution under natural rainfall conditions can produce an accurate description of runoff generation fig 10 shows the comparison between observed total runoff and calculated total runoff all the rainfall events were used to verify the model of total runoff the total runoff generated under uniform conditions was calculated using eq 19 and the total runoff generated under natural rainfall conditions was calculated using eqs 24 29 and 34 as shown in fig 10 almost all the points are slightly above the x y straight line labeled 1 1 it indicates that the calculated total runoff may slightly exceed the observed total runoff the reason for that may be due to the model being unable to predict accurately the infiltration process in the initial stage of rainfall the values of rmse and r2 are 0 6 and 0 98 respectively hence the model can be used to predict the total runoff as the calculated data broadly agree with the observed data 4 2 sediment 4 2 1 determination of parameters as mentioned above the sediment yield rate in a rainfall event under uniform rainfall conditions can be predicted with eq 38 however the parameters cr and cf are unknown hence the model cannot be easily used unless the values of cr and cf are defined seventy two rainfall events rainfall events 7 78 were used to determine the values of cr and cf fig 11 a shows their values that were obtained by fitting curves using eq 38 the results indicated that the values of cr and cf were different under different conditions overall however the values of cr and cf are within a narrow range hence the mean values of cr and cf 0 15 and 0 12 respectively can be considered as recommended values that can be used to predict sediment yield fig 11b shows the comparison between observed and calculated sediment yield using the recommended values of cr and cf the degree of agreement between observed data and calculated data was quantified by rmse and r2 2 32 and 0 77 respectively the results show that using recommended values does produce an error to a certain extent the main cause of the error is that there are too many factors that affect the sediment yield but not included in the sediment continuity equation such as water content and texture of soil surface on the other hand using mean values in place of actual values will also produce an error nevertheless using recommended values for cr and cf of 0 15 and 0 12 respectively enables the application of the proposed model much easier as well as with an acceptable accuracy 4 2 2 model evaluation to verify the accuracy of the approximate solution for the sediment yield process under uniform rainfall conditions three rainfall events rainfall events 79 81 were used fig 12 shows the comparison between observed and calculated using eq 38 and the recommended values of cr and cf sediment yield rate as can be seen from fig 12 the approximate solution can quickly reach the stable stage after the start of rainfall due to the change rate of sediment yield over time in the stable stage being ignored i e the sediment yield only changes with distance in the stable stage the rmse of the three rainfall events are 6 15 9 35 and 16 89 and the r2 of the three rainfall events are 0 66 0 75 and 0 71 respectively although the approximate solution provided in this paper may not capture the complete process during a rainfall event it can reflect the stable value of sediment yield rate to a certain extent the stable sediment yield rates for the three rainfall events are 54 39 62 80 and 126 71 g min m2 and the stable values of the approximate solution are 51 14 68 52 and 138 53 g min m2 respectively the relative errors of the observed average sediment yield rate and stable approximate solution are 5 98 9 11 and 9 41 respectively fig 13 shows the comparison between observed sediment yield rate rainfall events 82 84 with the approximate solution using eqs 43 46 and 49 using the recommended values of cr and cf under natural rainfall conditions the rmse of the three rainfall events are 0 15 0 14 and 0 13 and the r2 of the three rainfall events are 0 86 0 94 and 0 88 respectively the results show that the approximate solution can closely match the observed sediment yield under natural rainfall conditions 5 conclusions an approximate analytical solution for overland flow and sediment transport has been described in this paper the obtained analytical solution was based on the assumptions that the flow regime of overland flow was transitional with the value of parameter β in the kinematic wave model being approximately two and the change rate of unit discharge with distance being constant and equal to the runoff rate at the outlet of the plane the excess rainfall under uniform rainfall intensity conditions was treated as constant the process of overland flow generation in the rising and recession stages can be described under uniform rainfall intensity conditions to apply the model to natural rainfall conditions the excess rainfall was considered as constant over a small interval t 0 t the comparison of experimental results and calculated results shows that the formula for describing overland flow is accurate both for uniform rainfall intensity and natural rainfall conditions the rainfall induced erosion was divided into splash erosion and runoff erosion to obtain the analytical solution the change rate of sediment with time in the stable stage was ignored the sediment transport model was formulated for uniform rainfall conditions the parameters cr and cf in the model were determined to have recommended values of 0 15 and 0 12 respectively the comparison between experimental and calculated results shows that the approximate analytical solution under uniform rainfall conditions is unable to capture the complete process of sediment yield as the change rate of sediment yield with time in the stable stage was ignored in the model but the model can accurately predict the stable value of sediment

7465,soil and water loss from farmland causes land degradation and water pollution thus continued efforts are needed to establish mathematical model for quantitative analysis of relevant processes and mechanisms in this study an approximate analytical solution has been developed for overland flow model and sediment transport model offering a simple and effective means to predict overland flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions in the overland flow model the flow regime was considered to be transitional with the value of parameter β in the kinematic wave model approximately two the change rate of unit discharge with distance was assumed to be constant and equal to the runoff rate at the outlet of the plane the excess rainfall was considered to be constant under uniform rainfall conditions the overland flow model developed can be further applied to natural rainfall conditions by treating excess rainfall intensity as constant over a small time interval for the sediment model the recommended values of the runoff erosion calibration constant cr and the splash erosion calibration constant cf have been given in this study so that it is easier to use the model these recommended values are 0 15 and 0 12 respectively comparisons with observed results were carried out to validate the proposed analytical solution the results showed that the approximate analytical solution developed in this paper closely matches the observed data thus providing an alternative method of predicting runoff generation and sediment yield and offering a more convenient method of analyzing the quantitative relationships between variables furthermore the model developed in this study can be used as a theoretical basis for developing runoff and erosion control methods keywords overland flow soil erosion approximate analytical solution natural rainfall 1 introduction soil erosion and nutrient loss caused by rainfall contribute significantly to land degradation and nonpoint source pollution the processes of runoff generation and soil erosion need to be better understood and quantified predicting rainfall runoff is critical in predicting soil erosion raff and ramirez 2005 mathematical models related to runoff generation and sediment transport have been used as an effective way of predicting soil and water loss during rainfall with the process of overland flow generation usually described using saint venant equations i e the continuity equation and the momentum equation wang et al 2002 however it is very difficult to obtain analytical solutions as these equations are highly nonlinear wang et al 2006 meaning that only numerical techniques can be used ying et al 2004 crossley et al 2003 lackey and sotiropoulos 2005 when the acceleration term is ignored the saint venant equations can be simplified using diffusion wave equations hayami 1951 developed an analytical solution for diffusion wave equations in rivers by using a disturbance function kazeyilmaz ahan and medina 2007 and kazeyilmaz ahan 2012 provided a solution for overland flow then improved the solution for diffusion waves applied to overland flow by employing the de hoog algorithm govindaraju et al 1988 and rao and kavvas 1991 suggested that diffusion wave equations may be better suited to steep rough slopes when the acceleration and pressure terms are ignored the saint venant equations can be expressed as kinematic wave equations the explicit analytical solution for uniform rainfall in time and space to kinematic wave equations was first given by henderson and wooding 1964 parlange et al 1981 developed a general analytical solution to the kinematic flow for variable rainfall sander et al 1990 obtained the solution for when infiltration rate exceeds rainfall intensity by considering the excess rainfall to be equal to the hydraulic conductivity luce and cundy 1992 modified the kinematic wave equation by using the philips infiltration equation to predict excess rainfall and applied the solution to field data tsai and yang 2005 used the method of characteristics integrated with cubic spline interpolation to compute one dimensional and two dimensional kinematic wave models to obtain the closed form of the analytical solution mizumura 2006 assumed that the unit discharge in manning s formula was a parabolic curve gottardi and venutelli 2008 suggested an accurate time integration method for diffusion wave and kinematic wave equations morooka et al 2016 proposed a new theoretical framework theory of stochastic process to estimate rainfall runoff foster 1986 defined detachment as the soil particles being removed from the soil surface and transport as the detached soil particles moving to some location away from the detachment point the processes of detachment and transport can be described using the continuity equation with sediment discharge considered to be a function of water flow soil properties and topography bennet 1974 most of the physical model developed in this study was based on the continuity equation the answers areal nonpoint source watershed response simulation model was used to predict erosion of agricultural watersheds by treating runoff and erosion as independent processes beasley et al 1980 the weep water erosion prediction project model nearing et al 1989 divides rainfall erosion into rill and interrill areas and calculates the erosion in these areas separately eurosem euro open soil erosion model morgan et al 1998 is an event based model which assumes that a few events every year are the main contributors to erosion it also calculates rill erosion and interrill erosion separately for this paper an approximate analytical model for predicting overland flow and rainfall erosion was developed the overland flow model was then used to predict flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions the recommended values for the runoff erosion calibration and splash erosion calibration constants are defined in this paper producing a simple and effective model for predicting overland flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 overland flow the kinematic wave model was used to describe the process of overland flow generation 1 q x t x h x t t r e t 2 q x t α h x t β where q x t is the unit discharge cm2 min h x t is the depth of overland

discharge per unit area at the outlet of the plane moore 1985 agnese et al 2001 the unit discharge can be expressed as 3 q x t q t x where q t is the discharge per unit area cm min combining eqs 2 and

in order to obtain an approximate solution under uniform rainfall conditions it is necessary to estimate accurately the parameters particularly β which reflects the degree of turbulence and the type of flow regime that the overland flow belongs to in this research the flow regime is treated as transitional with the value of β approximated to be two horton 1938 agnese et al 2001 singh 2002 in addition the excess rainfall under uniform rainfall intensity conditions was considered to be a constant i e rainfall intensity minus stable infiltration rate when obtaining the solution to the integration of eq 10 agnese et al 2001 moore 1985 then eq 10 can be approximated as 11 t t p 1 3 l α 1 2 q t p q t q t 1 2 r e q t dq t hence for uniform rainfall intensity the outflow rate in the rising stage can be expressed as 12 q t tanh 2 3 2 α r e l t t p r e the unit discharge and flow depth in the rising stage can be expressed as 13 q x t tanh 2 3 2 α r e l t t p r e x 14 h x t r e x α

in a rainfall event cm using the parameters shown in table 1 the unit discharge on the slope was simulated for three rainfall intensities three slope lengths and three values of parameter α examples a b and c fig 1 shows the calculated results using eq 17 for unit discharge the simulated results show that the analytical solutions have a good performance in describing the processes of runoff generation note that the increasing values of α results in an increased unit discharge the values of α are affected by slope gradient and the roughness coefficient therefore fig 1c shows the comprehensive effects of slope gradients and roughness coefficients 2 1 2 the approximate solution under natural rainfall conditions the natural rainfall process does not result in absolutely uniform rainfall intensity thus the application of the approximate solution under natural rainfall conditions needs to be further analyzed the natural rainfall process can be divided into several events based on the rainfall intensity assuming q t 0 q 0 t 0 is any time during the rainfall event the excess rainfall can be considered constant over a small time interval t 0 t there are then some different cases to be examined case 1 re q 0 in this case the integration of eq 10 gives 20 t t 0 2 3 l α r e arctanh q t r e arctanh q 0 r e the solution of eq 20 is 21 q t tanh 2 arctanh q 0 r e 3 2 α r e l t

following example demonstrates the analytical solution given continuous rainfall for 20 min over a 1000 cm long slope at a rainfall intensity of 0 2 cm min decreasing to 0 1 cm min for the next 20 min and α assumed to be 100 fig 2 shows the simulated results for unit discharge runoff depth and runoff amount the first rainfall stage 0 t 20 was modeled using eqs 22 24 with the second rainfall stage 20 t 40 modeled using eqs 27 29 the recession stage was modeled using eqs 32 34 2 1 3 comparison with another analytical solution cevza and miguel 2007 described an analytical solution to the kinematic wave equation kw and diffusion wave equation dw with constant wave celerity and hydraulic diffusivity applied to the overland flow problem two examples a and b provided in cevza and miguel 2007 were used to make a comparison with the parameters used listed in table 2 the simulated results of the solutions are listed in fig 3 as can be seen from the figures there are some differences among these solutions comparing the curves in fig 3a the results show different behaviors at peak flow and the recession stage the kw cevza reaches a maximum runoff rate for a sustained time the kw this study and the dw cevza have smaller peaks than given by the kw cevza the kw this study decreases more rapidly in the recession stage than either of the kw cevza and dw cevza in fact this an expected as it would then better reflect the actual situation fig 3b shows the analytical solution for runoff rate under variable rainfall intensity conditions the kw this study agrees reasonably well with the kw cevza and dw cevza for the first period of the rainfall but not well for the second period of rainfall the kw this study and dw cevza have smaller and smoother peaks than the kw cevza the results of the kw this study under variable rainfall conditions are similar to those of the dw cevza thus the kw this study can better reflect the actual situation and has fewer unknown parameters cevza s method requires the determination of the constant celerity and hydraulic diffusivity 2 2 sediment transport the process of sediment transport under rainfall conditions is usually described using the sediment continuity equation soil erosion on a sloped land can be divided into splash erosion and runoff erosion thomas and wesley 1994 and can be expressed as 35 s x t h x t t s x t q x t x c f ρ γ jh x t c r ρ r 2 where s x t is the sediment concentration g cm3 γ is density of water g cm3 ρ is the bulk density of soil g cm3 r is the actual received rainfall intensity on unit soil surface cm min cf is the calibration constant of runoff erosion g min cm3 and cr is the calibration constant of splash erosion g2 min cm7 as is well known the infiltration capacity of soil rapidly decreases at the start of rainfall then the infiltration rate will tend to stabilize hence the discharge and the runoff depth will tend to stabilize as well this results in the erosion caused by rainfall and runoff changing very little in this stable stage therefore the rate of change of sediment over time in the stable stage has been ignored in this research foster and meyer 1972 beasley et al 1980 yu 2003 thus eq 35 can be approximated as follows 36 s x t q x t x c f ρ γ jh x t c r ρ r 2 2 2 1 sediment transport under uniform rainfall conditions the solutions for variables q and h have been given in the previous section based on eqs 13 14 and 36 the sediment concentration in runoff water can be expressed as 37 s x t 2 tanh 3 2 α r e l t t p c f γ j r e x α 3 c r r 2 3 ρ r e tanh 2 3

sr x t is the sediment yield rate during the recession stage g min cm2 integrating eqs 38 and 40 with respect to time yields the sediment load yield per unit area 41a m t 2 3 c f γ j ρ r e l α c r r 2

1 sediment transport in the runoff was simulated for three rainfall intensities three slope lengths and three values of parameter α example a b and c in addition the sediment transport was also simulated for different overland slope as the parameter j appears separately in the solutions of sediment transport equations the parameter j was specified as 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 and the soil bulk density and manning s roughness coefficient were specified as 1 40 g cm3 and 0 05 s m1 3 respectively the simulated results in fig 4 show that the analytical solutions describe the processes of sediment transport well as can be seen from fig 4 increasing rainfall intensity slope length and overland slope result in an increase in sediment yield rate conversely however increasing values of α result in a decrease in sediment yield rate 2 2 2 sediment transport under natural rainfall conditions combining the solutions for runoff generation under natural rainfall conditions with eq 36 there are then three different cases to be examined case 1 re q 0 combining eqs 22 23 and 36 the solution of eq 36 is given by 42 s x t 2 tanh arctanh q 0 r e 3 2 α r e l t t 0 c f γ j r e x α 3 c r r 2 3 ρ

analytical solution for sediment transport under variable rainfall conditions given continuous rainfall for 20 min over a 1000 cm long slope at a rainfall intensity of 0 2 cm min decreasing 0 1 cm min for the next 20 min and a value of α was assumed to be 100 fig 5 shows the simulated results for sediment yield rate and sediment load per unit area the first rainfall stage 0 t 20 was modeled using eqs 43 and 44 with the second rainfall stage 20 t 40 modeled using eqs 46 and 47 the recession stage was modeled using eqs 49 and 50 3 materials and methods 3 1 rainfall simulations eighty four rainfall events from published results see details in table 3 were used to verify the accuracy of our analytical solutions these rainfall events occurred under various conditions such as different slope lengths from 1 to 22 m slope gradients from 0 02 to 0 78 soil bulk densities from 1 20 to1 6 g cm3 stable infiltration rates from 0 0045 to 0 094 cm min rainfall intensities from 0 04 to 0 28 cm min rainfall durations from 30 to 408 min and manning roughness coefficients from 0 00004 to 0 0068 min cm1 3 rainfall events 1 3 were used to verify the analytical solution of runoff generation under uniform rainfall conditions the experimental data were collected from wang et al 2015 liu and singh 2004 and tao and wu 2015 for events 1 and 3 respectively events 1 and 2 were conducted in the rainfall simulation hall at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau and event 3 was carried out at the changwu state key agro experimental station on the loess plateau the test soils were loess rainfall intensities were 0 2 0 16 and 0 167 cm min slope lengths were 5 3 3 2 and 1 m and soil bulk densities were 1 6 1 35 and 1 31 g cm3 rainfall events 4 6 were used to verify the analytical solution of runoff generation under natural rainfall conditions the experimental data were obtained from lloyd and tommy 2010 and the experiments were conducted in an outdoor experimental station at nanyang technological university the experimental plots were 25 m long and 1 m wide and were equipped with rainfall and flow measurement devices the overland plane had a slope of 0 02 the three rainfall storm events used occurred between october 2002 and december 2002 the changes in rainfall intensity during natural rainfall are shown in fig 6 rainfall events 7 78 were used to determine the parameters cf the calibration constant of runoff erosion and cr the calibration constant of splash erosion the treatments were different slope lengths xing et al 2016 different rainfall intensities dong et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 different slope gradients he et al 2016 shen et al 2016 and different rainfall durations catherine et al 2010 five types of soil were selected for these experiments being sandy sandy loam clay loam silt loam and silt clay rainfall events 79 81 were used to verify the process of sediment yield under uniform rainfall conditions the experimental data were obtained from zhao et al 2015 the experiments were conducted in the simulated hall at the red soil erosion and flow hydraulics of south china in guangzhou city the test used red soil taken from the non agricultural land located in a guangzhou suburb rainfall intensities used were 0 15 0 2 and 0 3 cm min the slope length was 2 m and the slope gradient was 0 42 rainfall events 82 84 were used to verify the process of sediment yield under natural rainfall conditions the experimental data were obtained from zhang et al 2008 the experiments were conducted in the soil conservation ecological science and technology demonstration park of jiangxi province the slope grade used was 12 and the slope length was 22 m the testing plot was located below the uncovered slope the changes in intensity during rainfall are shown in fig 7 3 2 data analysis the agreement between the observed and calculated data was assessed using rmse root mean square error and r2 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient 51 rmse i n o i c i 2 n 52 r 2 1 i 1 n o i c i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is the observed data ci is the calculated data n is the number of measurement and o is the mean value of observed data 4 results and discussion 4 1 overland flow three rainfall events rainfall events 1 3 were used to verify the accuracy of the approximate solution under uniform rainfall conditions the observed unit discharge was fitted with the data calculated from the approximate solution eqs 13 and 17 as shown in fig 8 it shows that the approximate solution overestimated the unit discharge at the initial stage but predicted well at the steady stage the reason for the overestimated unit discharge is mainly because that the rainfall intensity was considered as being constant in the overland flow however rainfall events can last a long time and the soil infiltration capacity rapidly decreases during the initial stage hence the approximation of the rainfall intensity may give a slightly larger runoff value than the actual one but have no significant effect on the total runoff the rmse for the three rainfall events was 1 16 0 65 and 0 93 respectively and r2 was 0 81 0 92 and 0 74 respectively it can be concluded that the approximate solution can be used to predict the unit discharge reasonably accurately another three rainfall events rainfall events 4 6 were used to verify the accuracy of the approximate solution under natural rainfall conditions as shown in fig 9 which shows the observed runoff rate curve fitted to the approximate solution eqs 21 26 and 31 the rmse of the three rainfall events was 0 028 0 032 and 0 041 respectively and the r2 of the three rainfall events was 0 91 0 89 and 0 86 respectively the results indicated that the approximate solution under natural rainfall conditions can produce an accurate description of runoff generation fig 10 shows the comparison between observed total runoff and calculated total runoff all the rainfall events were used to verify the model of total runoff the total runoff generated under uniform conditions was calculated using eq 19 and the total runoff generated under natural rainfall conditions was calculated using eqs 24 29 and 34 as shown in fig 10 almost all the points are slightly above the x y straight line labeled 1 1 it indicates that the calculated total runoff may slightly exceed the observed total runoff the reason for that may be due to the model being unable to predict accurately the infiltration process in the initial stage of rainfall the values of rmse and r2 are 0 6 and 0 98 respectively hence the model can be used to predict the total runoff as the calculated data broadly agree with the observed data 4 2 sediment 4 2 1 determination of parameters as mentioned above the sediment yield rate in a rainfall event under uniform rainfall conditions can be predicted with eq 38 however the parameters cr and cf are unknown hence the model cannot be easily used unless the values of cr and cf are defined seventy two rainfall events rainfall events 7 78 were used to determine the values of cr and cf fig 11 a shows their values that were obtained by fitting curves using eq 38 the results indicated that the values of cr and cf were different under different conditions overall however the values of cr and cf are within a narrow range hence the mean values of cr and cf 0 15 and 0 12 respectively can be considered as recommended values that can be used to predict sediment yield fig 11b shows the comparison between observed and calculated sediment yield using the recommended values of cr and cf the degree of agreement between observed data and calculated data was quantified by rmse and r2 2 32 and 0 77 respectively the results show that using recommended values does produce an error to a certain extent the main cause of the error is that there are too many factors that affect the sediment yield but not included in the sediment continuity equation such as water content and texture of soil surface on the other hand using mean values in place of actual values will also produce an error nevertheless using recommended values for cr and cf of 0 15 and 0 12 respectively enables the application of the proposed model much easier as well as with an acceptable accuracy 4 2 2 model evaluation to verify the accuracy of the approximate solution for the sediment yield process under uniform rainfall conditions three rainfall events rainfall events 79 81 were used fig 12 shows the comparison between observed and calculated using eq 38 and the recommended values of cr and cf sediment yield rate as can be seen from fig 12 the approximate solution can quickly reach the stable stage after the start of rainfall due to the change rate of sediment yield over time in the stable stage being ignored i e the sediment yield only changes with distance in the stable stage the rmse of the three rainfall events are 6 15 9 35 and 16 89 and the r2 of the three rainfall events are 0 66 0 75 and 0 71 respectively although the approximate solution provided in this paper may not capture the complete process during a rainfall event it can reflect the stable value of sediment yield rate to a certain extent the stable sediment yield rates for the three rainfall events are 54 39 62 80 and 126 71 g min m2 and the stable values of the approximate solution are 51 14 68 52 and 138 53 g min m2 respectively the relative errors of the observed average sediment yield rate and stable approximate solution are 5 98 9 11 and 9 41 respectively fig 13 shows the comparison between observed sediment yield rate rainfall events 82 84 with the approximate solution using eqs 43 46 and 49 using the recommended values of cr and cf under natural rainfall conditions the rmse of the three rainfall events are 0 15 0 14 and 0 13 and the r2 of the three rainfall events are 0 86 0 94 and 0 88 respectively the results show that the approximate solution can closely match the observed sediment yield under natural rainfall conditions 5 conclusions an approximate analytical solution for overland flow and sediment transport has been described in this paper the obtained analytical solution was based on the assumptions that the flow regime of overland flow was transitional with the value of parameter β in the kinematic wave model being approximately two and the change rate of unit discharge with distance being constant and equal to the runoff rate at the outlet of the plane the excess rainfall under uniform rainfall intensity conditions was treated as constant the process of overland flow generation in the rising and recession stages can be described under uniform rainfall intensity conditions to apply the model to natural rainfall conditions the excess rainfall was considered as constant over a small interval t 0 t the comparison of experimental results and calculated results shows that the formula for describing overland flow is accurate both for uniform rainfall intensity and natural rainfall conditions the rainfall induced erosion was divided into splash erosion and runoff erosion to obtain the analytical solution the change rate of sediment with time in the stable stage was ignored the sediment transport model was formulated for uniform rainfall conditions the parameters cr and cf in the model were determined to have recommended values of 0 15 and 0 12 respectively the comparison between experimental and calculated results shows that the approximate analytical solution under uniform rainfall conditions is unable to capture

7466,continuous water table wt measurements from peatlands are scarce and if existing at all very short consequently proxy indicators are critically needed to simulate hydrological changes in peatlands over longer time periods in this study we demonstrate that tree ring width trw records of scots pine pinus sylvestris l growing in the čepkeliai peatland southern lithuania can be used as a proxy to reconstruct hydrological variability in a raised bog environment a two step modelling procedure was applied to extend existing measurements and to develop a new and longer peatland wt time series to this end we used instrumental wt measurements extending back to 2002 meteorological records a p pet difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration series covering the period 1935 2014 so as to construct a tree ring based time series of wt fluctuations at the site for the period 1870 2014 strongest correlations were obtained between average annual wt measured at the bog margin and total p pet over 7 years r 0 923 p 0 00001 as well as between modelled wt and standardized trw data with a two years lag r 0 602 p 0 001 for those periods where wt fluctuated at the level of pine roots which is typically at 50 cm depth below the peat surface our results suggest that moisture is a limiting factor for tree growth at peatlands but below a certain wt level 50 cm under the soil surface drought becomes a limiting factor instead to validate the wt reconstruction from the čepkeliai bog results were compared to nemunas river runoff since ce 1812 r 0 39 p 0 00001 1870 2014 we conclude that peatlands can act both as sinks and sources of greenhouse gases in case that hydrological conditions change but that hydrological lags and complex feedbacks still hamper our understanding of several processes affecting the hydrology and carbon budget in peatlands we therefore call for the development of further proxy records of water table variability in peatlands to improve our understanding of peatland responses to climatic changes keywords tree rings raised bog hydrology water table fluctuation čepkeliai wetland complex lithuania 1 introduction wetland ecosystems are important carriers of biodiversity and habitats for numerous plant and animal species as well as a significant agent in the global carbon cycle macdonald et al 2006 turetsky et al 2015 most often peatlands act as major carbon sinks gorham 1991 lafleur et al 2001 turunen et al 2002 sagerfors et al 2008 salm et al 2009 but can also be significant sources of ch4 co2 and nox matthews and fung 1987 saarnio et al 2007 turetsky et al 2014 joosten and clarke 2002 tanneberger and wichtmann 2011 especially in the case that hydrological conditions should be changing spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon fluxes in raised bogs are closely linked to the hydrological conditions in the peatland moore and knowles 1989 freeman et al 1993 salm et al 2009 gažovič et al 2010 mitsch et al 2013 hydrological shifts in peatlands can be measured as water table wt changes but the scarcity of instrumental time series often limited to a few years has so far hampered a precise knowledge of relationships between c sequestration and wt fluctuations beyond the period covered by instrumental records proxy records for peatland wt depth which indirectly also generate information about c sequestration in the peatlands are therefore highly valuable to improve both moisture and climate reconstructions several studies have shown that radial tree growth of peatland trees is limited by the moisture status in the water unsaturated zone and thereby drive the formation of tree ring width trw patterns that are closely linked to wt fluctuations in peatlands boggie 1972 pukienė 2001 leuschner et al 2002 edvardsson et al 2016 periods for which the water table has been located close to the bog surface usually generated low oxygen uptake and limited nutrient assimilation by the root system of trees linderholm et al 2002 which most often resulted in depressed tree growth boggie 1972 edvardsson et al 2016 consequently trw data from peatland trees have been used to reconstruct hydrological variations within peatlands at annual to decadal time scales edvardsson et al 2015a edvardsson and hansson 2015 initial studies based on peatland trees have already been performed in the baltic region by balevičius et al 1984 cedro and lamentowicz 2011 smiljanic et al 2014 and edvardsson et al 2015a most often negative correlations have been observed between the moisture status in the peatland and radial tree growth smiljanic et al 2014 edvardsson et al 2015a but lag responses often rendered the interpretation of results difficult most of these studies have been based on the correlation between trw and temperature and precipitation records which however only yielded indirect information on wt changes in the peatland further studies are therefore needed to increase our understanding about the complex interaction between hydrology and tree growth at peatlands as well as to improve our moisture reconstructions using tree ring data from peatland trees in this context an almost natural semi pristine wetland complex in southern lithuania was chosen a relatively long instrumental record of hydrological observations already exist from this wetland complex as well as meteorological data from a nearby weather station in this study we explore the potential of scots pine growing at the peatland as a proxy for wt fluctuations and a tool to extend wt records beyond the limits of the instrumental series at the study site our objectives are to i extend the wt series with a p pet series i e difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ii establish a relation between trw and wt values and iii develop a wt record based on trw data and instrumental measurements these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following statistical analyses results and interpretation discussions sections 2 material and methods 2 1 study site roughly one tenth 9 9 of lithuania is covered by peatlands of which 2 7 are pristine or semi pristine and the remaining 7 2 have been drained or managed these figures are comparable to lithuania s neighboring countries taminskas et al 2012 the čepkeliai wetland complex is located in southern lithuania 54 01 n 24 32 e and borders belarus fig 1 the čepkeliai state nature reserve was established in 1975 and has formed a ramsar site since 1993 the total area of the reserve is 8477 ha of which 5858 ha are covered by a wetland complex and the remaining 2725 ha are covered by forests the čepkeliai state nature reserve was formed to preserve one of the oldest and most natural raised bogs in lithuania as well as for the conservation of forested continental sand dunes lakes the natural hydrological regime of the raised bog and a rare plant and animal life the highest point of čepkeliai is 134 m above sea level a s l in the domes of the raised bog and reaches 127 130 m a s l in the marginal fens as such the wetland complex represent one of the largest peatlands in the baltic region and is in addition characterized by unusually large open raised bog areas 82 scattered fens 16 transition mires 2 small lakes pools forested islands and permanently flooded old forested areas povilaitis et al 2011 taminskas et al 2012 the wetland complex at čepkeliai has been formed during the holocene in the watershed of the katra ūla and grūda streams nemunas river catchment rapid establishment of trees has been observed in the čepkeliai raised bog over recent decades taminskas et al 2008b a process which is believed to be related to hydrological changes in the region edvardsson et al 2015b ruseckas and grigaliūnas 2008 as clear signs of anthropogenic activities are clearly absent in the čepkeliai wetland complex and its surroundings stančikaitė et al 2017 colonization of the site with trees is believed to be related to hydrological changes associated with ongoing climate change bukantis 1994 stonevičius et al 2017 geology and long term palaeohydrological changes in the region have been discussed extensively in the past linkevičienė 2009 mažeika et al 2009 balakauskas et al 2013 stančikaitė et al 2017 whereas research on bog vegetation and its interaction with hydrology has remained

hydrometeorological survey and located about 27 km north of the čepkeliai wetland complex at this site monthly precipitation and air temperature have been measured since 1929 average annual precipitation in the region is 680 mm yr 1 max min values 423 874 mm yr 1 respectively about two thirds of annual precipitation falls during the vegetation period of trees that locally lasts from late may to late september over the last decade precipitation has been above the average especially during the vegetation period i e 14 between 2004 and 2014 as compared to 1929 2014 average annual temperature has been 6 4 c 1929 2014 january is usually coldest with an average temperature of 5 1 c whereas july is highest with 17 7 c 2 3 hydrological data water table fluctuations at čepkeliai raised bog have been measured manually in 5 wells fig 2 table 1 at ten day intervals from april to november since 2002 with a precision of 0 01 m well 4 g is situated in the sand dunes adjacent to the raised bog whereas well 4 a can be found in a transition zone at the bog s margin where water from the raised bog dome is collected rigg 1925 osvald 1933 howie and meerveld 2011 by contrast wells 5 a 6 a and 3 a are located inside the raised bog water level in the wells was measured in m a s l the elevation of the geodetic survey benchmark rp 2 is h 135 67 m 54 1 1 47 n 24 25 53 7 e changes in water table are expressed as changes relative top the height of a zero level in each well which was set at the top of the peat layer for well no 4 a for instance the zero level i e the top of the peat layer in 2009 was at an elevation of 133 1 m a s l runoff data from the nemunas river are measured at the smalininkai gauging station 55 4 22 05 n 22 35 15 86 e by the lithuanian hydrometeorological survey we used this data to test and validate the tree ring based water table reconstructions from the čepkeliai raised bog the smalininkai gauging station has the longest measurement series of river runoff data in lithuania 1812 today 2 4 tree ring data in april september and october 2014 increment cores from 96 scots pine trees pinus sylvestris l were collected using a pressler increment borer trees growing near the raised bog lagg zone were sampled as low as 40 cm above the peat surface so as to maximise the number of growth rings in these slow growing samples by contrast trees growing near ešerinis lake fig 1 were sampled at conventional breast height 130 cm as growth was less suppressed in their case tree cores were air dried and sanded with increasingly finer grit until tree rings and cellular structures became clearly visible stoffel and corona 2014 thereafter tree ring widths trw chronologies were computed based on the measurements of annual growth rings with a precision of 0 01 mm using a lintab 5 measuring table and tsapwin software rinn 2003 series were then cross dated with conventional dendrochronological techniques fritts 1976 the quality of measurements and trw chronologies was evaluated with cofecha holmes 1983 which allowed removal of trees characterized by asynchronous growth 3 statistical analyses to reconstruct hydrological variability in the čepkeliai peatland a two step modelling procedure was employed to i extend the instrumental wt series via a p pet analyses and ii to reconstruct wt fluctuations based on the trw series from pinus sylvestris growing at the peatland 3 1 wt reconstruction based on p pet analysis to reconstruct fluctuations of the water table in the čepkeliai raised bog we first computed relations between annual instrumental wt iwt changes and compared them to estimated precipitation vs potential evapotranspiration p pet data for time windows ranging from 1 to 10 years to estimate possible trends and or changes thereof in evaporative demand we looked at the four primary meteorological variables wind speed atmospheric humidity radiation and air temperature as these have been shown to be particularly relevant in long term water resource assessments mcvicar et al 2012 at the varėna meteorological station net radiation is not measured which prevented the application of penmans s or priestly taylor equations sumner and jacobs 2005 to estimate evapotranspiration we therefore used an equation based on air temperature in which potential evaporation rates are obtained via empirical relationships donohue et al 2010 in concrete terms and for the purpose of our study thornthwaite s equation thornthwaite 1948 has been applied as follows 1 pet 16 10 t i a where t represents average monthly temperature i is a heat index for a given area which is the sum of 12 monthly index values i and where a is an empirically derived exponent as a function of i 2 i t 5 1 514 3 a 0 000000675 i 3 0 0000771 i 2 0 01792 i 0 49239 to model pet in the čepkeliai peatland we used average monthly temperature from the varėna meteorological station the difference d between p and pet provides a simple means to measure water surplus or deficit for the analysed time window vicente serrano et al 2010 4 d i p i pet i based on this equation we estimate that roughly 69 of total precipitation is lost through evapotranspiration in čepkeliai of which 82 takes place in during the vegetation period of trees which is locally lasting from late may to late september on average the annual potential evapotranspiration is about 469 mm relations between p pet and iwt were thereafter modeled through regression estimates and used to reconstruct wt changes for the period of available meteorological data 3 2 relation between trw and wt in a second step relations between modeled mean annual water table mwt according to the p pet analyses were contrasted with annual tree growth to extend the hydroclimatic reconstruction further back in time to minimize the influence of non climatic variations and trends related to tree age and geometry the trw data was standardised and transformed into dimensionless trw indices fritts 1976 cook and kairiukstis 1990 using the arstan 41d software cook and krusic 2006 to preserve potential low frequency variations in tree growth a flexible friedman s variable span smoother friedman 1984 was used for standardization reliability of the trw chronologies and the common variance of the single series were evaluated with the expressed population signal eps wigley et al 1984 and running rbar cook and kairiukstis 1990 respectively the limit at which the records were considered reliable and well replicated was set to the commonly accepted threshold of eps 0 85 wigley et al 1984 three different trw chronologies were created using arstan 41d a raw trw chronology raw a standardised trw chronology std and a residual trw chronology res pearson correlation analysis was used to estimate the relationship between trw series std chronology and wt fluctuations lagged correlations between hydrological meteorological and dendrochronological data were computed to quantify potential lag effects nonlinearity between trw and mwt was taken into account by nonlinear regression segmented regression with a breakpoint at the vertex of best fit second order polynomial curve was used to establish the interval of wt fluctuations in which linear regression model could be applied 3 3 wt reconstruction using trw data separate calibration 1986 2012 and independent verification 1935 1964 periods were used to validate the wt reconstruction models based on our trw series developed from the peatland pines the trw based water table reconstruction trwwt was considered only for that period for which trw data were reliable and statistically robust nemunas river runoff data was thereafter used to validate the wt reconstructions obtained for the čepkeliai raised bog 4 results and interpretation 4 1 wt reconstruction derived from p pet assessment the correlation values 2002 2014 between annual instrumental water table iwt measurements in the different wells shown in fig 2 and the ratio of precipitation vs potential evapotranspiration p pet for periods ranging from 1 to 10 years are presented in table 2 the strongest correlation coefficient r 0 92 p 0 00001 was observed between average annual iwt at well 4 a located closest to the lagg and p pet over 7 years the following regression model was used for estimates of wt fluctuations from the p pet 5 wt 0 0014 σ 7 p pet 130 79 estimates from this model were then used to extend the wt series at the lagg well 4 a for the period 1935 2002 according to our reconstructions the wt fluctuated from 133 3 m a s l to 132 1 m a s l this means that the wt has been 20 cm above the zero level in wet years at the bog lagg and that its surroundings were subject to flooding at the other extreme in very dry years the wt at well 4 a was 100 cm below the level of the peat surface 4 2 relations of trw with wt after crossdating and evaluation of the trw series 50 out of 96 trees were included in the final trw chronologies used for wt reconstructions the relatively high rejection rate of samples 48 is related to the large number of missing rings in many tree ring samples the final trw chronologies and related sample depth over time are presented in fig 3 the eps values of the raw raw standardised std and residual res trw chronologies are above the critical threshold of 0 85 between 1870 and 2014 for all series strongest correlation has been obtained between the measured wt at well 4 a and the std trw chronology a lag effect between tree growth and water level in the peatland was detected as the strongest relation between trw and mwt which was obtained with a 2 year lag in the trw record moreover the 2 year lag between trw and mwt revealed a nonlinear dependence between the two parameters fig 4 nevertheless mwt could be segmented into two distinct intervals with a threshold at the vertex of the best fit curve i e at 132 6 m a s l i e 50 cm below the peat surface as characterized by different response of trw to wt fluctuations linear negative dependence r 0 57 of trw with mwt was observed when mwt fluctuated within a 50 cm layer below the peat surface but this relation vanished and even turned to insignificantly positive after the mwt dropped below the 50 cm threshold fig 5 our records show a dry period with water levels below 132 6 m a s l between 1965 and 1985 at the beginning of this phase tree growth was fairly moderate before a growth depression started to emerge in the 1970s followed by a gradual recovery up to 1981 with the exception of the period just described before negative correlations between mwt and std trw chronology was observed suggesting that increasing peat moisture limited tree growth at the peatland the strongest significant correlation coefficient r 0 604 p 0 00001 was computed between mwt and std trw chronology with an offset of 2 yrs in trw indices see table 3 which supports the idea that the wt fluctuations have a delayed influence on radial tree growth the correlation tests show that any rise in water table results in depressed tree radial growth which is visible in the form of narrower annual growth rings except for the extremely dry period 1965 1985 in fig 6 we compare std trw indices and mwt values with their low frequency components i e a 5 yr moving average in general terms those periods associated with depressed radial growth correspond with phases with high water levels as was the case for instance during 1935 1939 1945 1950 1958 1963 1983 1994 and ever since 2004 opposite conditions were recorded for periods with low water tables during 1939 1945 1953 1956 and to a lesser extent 1995 2003 during these phases relatively dry conditions allowed better growth in trees the only exception is observed for the period 1965 1985 as this interval was characterized by water table levels 132 6 m a s l the latter did not trigger any specific trends in tree growth 4 3 wt reconstruction based on trw data a significant correlation was obtained between wt fluctuations as derived from p pet analyses for well 4 a and the std trw chronology p 0 00001 provided that the dry period comprised between 1965 and 1985 was excluded from analyses the linear regression model between both datasets was calibrated over the period 1986 2012 whereas the time window 1935 1964 was used for independent model verification the correlation coefficient between mwt and std trw chronology using an offset of 2 years is r 0 602 p 0 001 for the calibration period 1986 2012 and the linear regression model is expressed as follows 6 trwwt t 0 9564 std t 2 133 91 where trwwtt is the reconstructed wt based on trw in year t and stdt 2 is the tree ring std index with a 2 yr offset for the verification period correlation between observed and estimated wt fluctuations is 0 691 p 0 0001 based on the significance of this test our model was thereafter used to estimate wt levels at the site between 1870 and 1935 fig 7 periods with high water tables 133 0 m a s l or 0 1 m below the peat surface were reconstructed for the phases 1870 1873 1879 1888 1902 1910 1915 1919 1926 1939 1947 1950 1957 1963 1983 1990 and since 2005 low water tables 132 8 m a s l or 0 3 m below the peat surface were detected in 1874 1878 1889 1897 1920 1926 1940 1946 1952 1956 and 1995 2003 noteworthy our tree ring records are not able to reproduce prolonged periods of low water tables during which values drop below 132 6 m a s l to validate our hydrological reconstructions the čepkeliai wt data was compared to mean annual runoff data from the nemunas river at smalininkai gauging station runoff data is assumed here to represent the common hydrological situation for the entire nemunas catchment area fig 8 reconstructed long term changes for the hydrological regime at čepkeliai raised bog which is located in the central course of nemunas river are significantly correlated with river runoff data r 0 39 p 0 00001 1870 2014 the agreement between the reconstructed trwwt and nemunas runoff data further underline the robustness of our reconstruction periods with high wt correspond to narrow growth rings in the trw records and years with large overall runoff this coherence suggests that trw data developed from peatland pine trees can be used as a proxy of wt levels in peatlands the only exception was the prolonged and exceptionally dry period in which the link between trw and wt disappeared 5 discussion 5 1 wt reconstruction based on p pet the different calculation models considered in this study have allowed comparison of different approaches in a field for which data is still scarce and knowledge of processes and drivers remains fragmentary the application of thornthwaite s equation based exclusively on a temperature relationship has certain limitations and at bests a theoretical justification taylor and ashcroft 1972 since temperature and vapour pressure gradients are related to the movement of air as well as to the heating of the soil the validity of the equation should not be generalized moreover the equation has to be tested empirically whenever the climate is appreciably different from the area in which it has been tested originally skaggs 1980 nokes 1995 xu and singh 2001 we opted for thornthwaite s equation due to a lack of more complete input data but also because earlier studies by taminskas et al 2008a have obtained a reliable relationship r2 from 0 57 to 0 62 between observed actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration in a set of sites close to our study site in that study the utility of thornthwaite s estimates towards a reconstruction of variability in evapotranspiration was tested by comparing results according to thornthwaite s equation with the same month weighing lysimeter method estimates of actual evapotranspiration at three locations fig 9 our study has also demonstrated the crucial role of a dense wt monitoring network so as to accurately reconstruct wt fluctuations in peat bogs indeed correlations between p pet trw data and raised bog wt fluctuations obviously depend on piezometer location table 2 in our case the strongest correlation was obtained at the raised bog lagg which is characterized by a lack of surface runoff the lagg is located in the lowest part of the bog and might therefore be the best location for the assessment of water resources in the bog water system howie and meerveld 2011 strong correlation coefficients between precipitation and iwt in the lagg further indicate that water level in the lagg depends more on the annual amount of precipitation than wt fluctuations in the raised bog slope or in the mineral soil surrounding the peat bog interestingly the lowest correlation coefficients were recorded between p pet and annual iwt in well 6 a located on the bog slope at a distance of 150 m from the bog margin fig 2 the steepest slope in bog surface along the cross section analyzed is located close to this well and the higher influence of surface runoff at this location apparently determines a decline in the correlation coefficient in this area most often the slope gradient on the bog surface declines as soon as the distance from bog margin increases bog surface is indeed close to flat in the area where well 3 a is located at a distance of 340 m from the bog margin fig 2 in this area wt is linked to p pet rather than surface runoff from other areas in the bog complex an increase in the correlation coefficient between iwt and p pet is therefore observed again and an increase in correlation is observed between iwt recorded in well 4 g located on sand dunes and p pet as compared to well 6 a inside the bog and p pet table 2 the water level in well 4 g is however most likely affected by both water supply from the bog and groundwater levels in the bog margins stronger correlations have been observed between annual iwt and p pet in wells located in the lagg and on the raised bog as compared to well 4 g located on sand dunes table 2 furthermore comparison between well 4 g and the wells located at the bog surface shows that water level varies differently inside the bog and on mineral soil sites over the year this may depend on differences in groundwater recharge in the wells on the bog and mineral soil especially during the dry season of the year iwt data from the bog wells is therefore more suitable for trw analysis than is iwt data from wells located on mineral soils outside the bog this observation is in agreement with comparisons between pine trees growing under identical climatic conditions but different soil moisture edvardsson et al 2015a even though the trees sometimes grew only a hundred meter apart correlation was often close to absent between the trw series from the mineral and peat soil pines our studies are also in agreement with results from howie and meerved 2011 suggesting that wt in a bog lagg is more integrated indicator of hydrological regime in the wetland 5 2 trw relations with wt changes in general wt changes in peat bogs are mainly controlled by precipitation but they also tend to be influenced by temperature controlled evapo transpi ration charman et al 2004 several studies have shown that peat bogs can indeed act as water reservoirs thereby buffering water and that wt fluctuations in peat bogs therefore can lag several years behind climatic or environmental changes kilian et al 1995 linderholm et al 2002 edvardsson and hansson 2015 this lag may also explain the delayed response that is sometimes recorded in trw records to climate changes especially if the series are developed from pines growing on raised bogs vaganov and kachaev 1992 edvardsson et al 2015a in this study the strongest correlation was computed between total p pet over 7 years and std trw chronology with a 2 yr lag our results also confirm that tree growth in peatlands reflects the multiannual synthesis of moisture variability as well as a hydrological lag and or feedback responses linderholm et al 2002 edvardsson et al 2015a edvardsson and hansson 2015 wt fluctuations within the peat bog are the main driver of radial growth of bog pines the 2 yr lag observed in our records table 3 is consistent with results from the männikjärve peat bog in estonia smiljanic et al 2014 lagged responses of about 3 yrs were detected between the increases in moisture derived from δ13c isotopes in annual tree rings and decreased radial growth of subfossil pine trees in two swedish bogs edvardsson et al 2014 drivers of lag responses can be related to the progressive inhibition of root formation or root decay in water saturated environments or the availability of nutrients in peaty substrates which have been shown to be highly dependent on the activity of decomposing microbes or mycorrhizae fungi kozlowski 1997 pallardy 2008 these processes however all depend on wt fluctuations as well dimitrov et al 2010 physiological adaptation of peatland pines to extremely wet conditions and shortage of nutrients e g peculiarities in carbohydrates storage system could also influence the existence of a slower reaction to environmental changes kozlowski 1997 studies on the contribution of different carbon sources on tree growth show rather variable ratios of new carbohydrates versus remobilised reserves from previous years ranging from 71 to 35 brüggemann et al 2011 but experiments on bog pines are still lacking edvardsson et al 2016 whether and to which degree carbon allocation and carbon fluxes in the plant soil system are affected by environmental stress conditions remains one of the research questions in this field brüggemann et al 2011 water saturated peat soils create unfavourable conditions for tree growth due to a number of physical chemical and biological processes kozlowski 1997 linderholm et al 2002 edvardsson et al 2016 most often increased peat moisture result in depressed tree growth which can be analysed a posteriori through the presence of narrower annual growth rings smiljanic et al 2014 edvardsson et al 2015a high water tables also restrict the development of tree roots to the upper aerobic peat layers coutts 1982 kozlowski 1997 leuschner et al 2007 and therefore limit the nutrient pool available for trees in an already nutrient limited environment ohlson 1995 moreover low oxygen levels in peat soils can favor oxygen deficiency in the upper plant tissues and can thus cause inhibition of plant growth boggie 1977 the growth patterns observed in this study are in line with these findings but also suggest that tree growth can be depressed during extremely dry phases as well similar to smiljanic et al 2014 we observe that extremely low water levels may cause growth stress as well a fact which may result from the shallow and horizontal spreading root systems of peat trees edvardsson et al 2016 in our study a weak positive link between mwt and std trw chronology indices was observed during the unusually dry period 1965 1985 during which the wt was as low as 132 6 m a s l or even lower i e the average annual depth of the water table was 50 cm below the peat surface although the water level started to rise again in 1978 the drought signal in the trw data persisted for some more years in times with low wt the surface layers of peat dry out leaving the shallow roots in the top peat layers with very limited access to water and hence expose the trees to drought stress braekke 1983 dang and lieffers 1989 pepin et al 2002 we hypothesize that during these dry periods trw will depend less on hydrological drivers taking into consideration recent global warming and the projected intensification of extremes rimkus et al 2011 stonevičius et al 2017 one may expect more frequent droughts in the study region and thus also increased drought stress on bog trees indeed our wt reconstructions show enhanced amplitudes of wt fluctuations in the second half of the 20th century 5 3 wt reconstruction based on trw the development of a 130 year wt reconstruction from peatland trw data represents the core of this study and an important step to a more widespread application of a new proxy record for moisture variability in peatland ecosystems far beyond the period covered by monitoring data such proxy records are important due to the close relation of hydrology with carbon sequestration in peatland ecosystems in general terms our results show that moister conditions generate harsher growth conditions for bog trees and are thus in line with previous findings leuschner et al 2002 edvardsson et al 2016 at the same time however our findings also indicate that unusually dry conditions may result in unfavorable growth conditions as well once that the wt falls below a threshold of 50 cm beneath the peat surface trw indices will no longer remain statistically dependent on wt depth in other words as soon as wt fluctuations fall 50 cm below the peat surface trw records will fail to significantly estimate past wt fluctuations under current conditions such conditions must however be considered as quite exceptional to reconstruct wt depths during such extremely dry periods as well one needs to take alternative proxies into consideration by way of example stable isotopes in tree rings may offer an opportunity however isotope studies on peatland trees have remained rather limited so far sass klaassen et al 2005 edvardsson et al 2014 in the case of proxies without annually resolved proxies like e g testate amoebae could thus be added to strengthen wt reconstructions especially in a longer term perspective hendon and charman 2004 van bellen et al 2014 lamentowicz et al 2015 despite the limitations of trw data to reconstruct mwt fluctuations during extreme droughts statistically significant correlation between our reconstruction and the instrumental nemunas runoff data suggests that trw records from peatland pines can indeed be used as a reliable proxy of past wt variability in peatlands moreover the reconstructed wt fluctuations in the čepkeliai raised bog correspond to periods which are associated with dry wet conditions known from the literature balevičius et al 1984 taminskas et al 2008a b 6 conclusions the radial growth of peatland pine trees is strongly influenced by wt fluctuations which in turn depend on changes in precipitation and temperature in our case the strongest correlation between average annual iwt and p pet totals has been obtained if the latter was considered for a period of 7 years further strong correlations were obtained between mwt and std trw chronology with a 2 yr lag while this lagged response sustains the findings in other raised bog studies more thorough investigations are necessary to really understand the eco physiological factors predetermining time lags in peatland ecosystem functioning the negative dependence of trw on wt fluctuations was found in this study as well provided that the latter fluctuated within a 50 cm layer below the peat surface by contrast the correlation quickly fades as soon as the wt drops below this threshold consequently and in case of extremely low water levels narrow trw may be formed as well which could possibly result in some bias moreover a weak correlation was observed between very low wt and trw suggesting a shift in limiting factors from a moisture limited radial increment to a growth depending on other limiting environmental factors despite these limitations trw series from pine trees were used successfully in this study as a valuable proxy to reconstruct wt fluctuations in the bog lagg zone in addition the reliability of trw chronologies is further demonstrated by the significant correlation observed between our reconstruction and nemunas runoff series considering the widespread availability of pine remains in peat deposits of boreo nemoral peat bogs edvardsson et

7466,continuous water table wt measurements from peatlands are scarce and if existing at all very short consequently proxy indicators are critically needed to simulate hydrological changes in peatlands over longer time periods in this study we demonstrate that tree ring width trw records of scots pine pinus sylvestris l growing in the čepkeliai peatland southern lithuania can be used as a proxy to reconstruct hydrological variability in a raised bog environment a two step modelling procedure was applied to extend existing measurements and to develop a new and longer peatland wt time series to this end we used instrumental wt measurements extending back to 2002 meteorological records a p pet difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration series covering the period 1935 2014 so as to construct a tree ring based time series of wt fluctuations at the site for the period 1870 2014 strongest correlations were obtained between average annual wt measured at the bog margin and total p pet over 7 years r 0 923 p 0 00001 as well as between modelled wt and standardized trw data with a two years lag r 0 602 p 0 001 for those periods where wt fluctuated at the level of pine roots which is typically at 50 cm depth below the peat surface our results suggest that moisture is a limiting factor for tree growth at peatlands but below a certain wt level 50 cm under the soil surface drought becomes a limiting factor instead to validate the wt reconstruction from the čepkeliai bog results were compared to nemunas river runoff since ce 1812 r 0 39 p 0 00001 1870 2014 we conclude that peatlands can act both as sinks and sources of greenhouse gases in case that hydrological conditions change but that hydrological lags and complex feedbacks still hamper our understanding of several processes affecting the hydrology and carbon budget in peatlands we therefore call for the development of further proxy records of water table variability in peatlands to improve our understanding of peatland responses to climatic changes keywords tree rings raised bog hydrology water table fluctuation čepkeliai wetland complex lithuania 1 introduction wetland ecosystems are important carriers of biodiversity and habitats for numerous plant and animal species as well as a significant agent in the global carbon cycle macdonald et al 2006 turetsky et al 2015 most often peatlands act as major carbon sinks gorham 1991 lafleur et al 2001 turunen et al 2002 sagerfors et al 2008 salm et al 2009 but can also be significant sources of ch4 co2 and nox matthews and fung 1987 saarnio et al 2007 turetsky et al 2014 joosten and clarke 2002 tanneberger and wichtmann 2011 especially in the case that hydrological conditions should be changing spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon fluxes in raised bogs are closely linked to the hydrological conditions in the peatland moore and knowles 1989 freeman et al 1993 salm et al 2009 gažovič et al 2010 mitsch et al 2013 hydrological shifts in peatlands can be measured as water table wt changes but the scarcity of instrumental time series often limited to a few years has so far hampered a precise knowledge of relationships between c sequestration and wt fluctuations beyond the period covered by instrumental records proxy records for peatland wt depth which indirectly also generate information about c sequestration in the peatlands are therefore highly valuable to improve both moisture and climate reconstructions several studies have shown that radial tree growth of peatland trees is limited by the moisture status in the water unsaturated zone and thereby drive the formation of tree ring width trw patterns that are closely linked to wt fluctuations in peatlands boggie 1972 pukienė 2001 leuschner et al 2002 edvardsson et al 2016 periods for which the water table has been located close to the bog surface usually generated low oxygen uptake and limited nutrient assimilation by the root system of trees linderholm et al 2002 which most often resulted in depressed tree growth boggie 1972 edvardsson et al 2016 consequently trw data from peatland trees have been used to reconstruct hydrological variations within peatlands at annual to decadal time scales edvardsson et al 2015a edvardsson and hansson 2015 initial studies based on peatland trees have already been performed in the baltic region by balevičius et al 1984 cedro and lamentowicz 2011 smiljanic et al 2014 and edvardsson et al 2015a most often negative correlations have been observed between the moisture status in the peatland and radial tree growth smiljanic et al 2014 edvardsson et al 2015a but lag responses often rendered the interpretation of results difficult most of these studies have been based on the correlation between trw and temperature and precipitation records which however only yielded indirect information on wt changes in the peatland further studies are therefore needed to increase our understanding about the complex interaction between hydrology and tree growth at peatlands as well as to improve our moisture reconstructions using tree ring data from peatland trees in this context an almost natural semi pristine wetland complex in southern lithuania was chosen a relatively long instrumental record of hydrological observations already exist from this wetland complex as well as meteorological data from a nearby weather station in this study we explore the potential of scots pine growing at the peatland as a proxy for wt fluctuations and a tool to extend wt records beyond the limits of the instrumental series at the study site our objectives are to i extend the wt series with a p pet series i e difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ii establish a relation between trw and wt values and iii develop a wt record based on trw data and instrumental measurements these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following statistical analyses results and interpretation discussions sections 2 material and methods 2 1 study site roughly one tenth 9 9 of lithuania is covered by peatlands of which 2 7 are pristine or semi pristine and the remaining 7 2 have been drained or managed these figures are comparable to lithuania s neighboring countries taminskas et al 2012 the čepkeliai wetland complex is located in southern lithuania 54 01 n 24 32 e and borders belarus fig 1 the čepkeliai state nature reserve was established in 1975 and has formed a ramsar site since 1993 the total area of the reserve is 8477 ha of which 5858 ha are covered by a wetland complex and the remaining 2725 ha are covered by forests the čepkeliai state nature reserve was formed to preserve one of the oldest and most natural raised bogs in lithuania as well as for the conservation of forested continental sand dunes lakes the natural hydrological regime of the raised bog and a rare plant and animal life the highest point of čepkeliai is 134 m above sea level a s l in the domes of the raised bog and reaches 127 130 m a s l in the marginal fens as such the wetland complex represent one of the largest peatlands in the baltic region and is in addition characterized by unusually large open raised bog areas 82 scattered fens 16 transition mires 2 small lakes pools forested islands and permanently flooded old forested areas povilaitis et al

discussed extensively in the past linkevičienė 2009 mažeika et al 2009 balakauskas et al 2013 stančikaitė et al 2017 whereas research on bog vegetation and its interaction with hydrology has remained

hydrometeorological survey and located about 27 km north of the čepkeliai wetland complex at this site monthly precipitation and air temperature have been measured since 1929 average annual precipitation in the region is 680 mm yr 1 max min values 423 874 mm yr 1 respectively about two thirds of annual precipitation falls during the vegetation period of trees that locally lasts from late may to late september over the last decade precipitation has been above the average especially during the vegetation period i e 14 between 2004 and 2014 as compared to 1929 2014 average annual temperature has been 6 4 c 1929 2014 january is usually coldest with an average temperature of 5 1 c whereas july is highest with 17 7 c 2 3 hydrological data water table fluctuations at čepkeliai raised bog have been measured manually in 5 wells fig 2 table 1 at ten day intervals from april to november since 2002 with a precision of 0 01 m well 4 g is situated in the sand dunes adjacent to the raised bog whereas well 4 a can be found in a transition zone at the bog s margin where water from the raised bog dome is collected rigg 1925 osvald 1933 howie and meerveld 2011 by contrast wells 5 a

water table are expressed as changes relative top the height of a zero level in each well which was set at the top of the peat layer for well no 4 a for instance the zero level i e the top of the peat layer in 2009 was at an elevation of 133 1 m a s l runoff data from the nemunas river are measured at the smalininkai gauging station 55 4 22 05 n 22 35 15 86 e by the lithuanian hydrometeorological survey we used this data to test and validate the tree ring based water table reconstructions from the čepkeliai raised bog the smalininkai gauging station has the longest measurement series of river runoff data in lithuania 1812 today 2 4 tree ring data in april september and october 2014 increment cores from 96 scots pine trees pinus sylvestris l were collected using a pressler increment borer trees growing near the raised bog lagg zone were sampled as low as 40 cm above the peat surface so as to maximise the number of growth rings in these slow growing samples by contrast trees growing near ešerinis lake fig 1 were sampled at conventional breast height 130 cm as growth was less suppressed in their case tree cores were air dried and sanded with increasingly finer grit until tree rings and cellular structures became clearly visible stoffel and corona 2014 thereafter tree ring widths trw chronologies were computed based on the measurements of annual growth rings with a precision of 0 01 mm using a lintab 5 measuring table and tsapwin software rinn 2003 series were then cross dated with conventional dendrochronological techniques fritts 1976 the quality of measurements and trw chronologies was evaluated with cofecha holmes 1983 which allowed removal of trees characterized by asynchronous growth 3 statistical analyses to reconstruct hydrological variability in the čepkeliai peatland a two step modelling procedure was employed to i extend the instrumental wt series via a p pet analyses and ii to reconstruct wt fluctuations based on the trw series from pinus sylvestris growing at the peatland 3 1 wt reconstruction based on p pet analysis to reconstruct fluctuations of the water table in the čepkeliai raised bog we first computed relations between annual instrumental wt iwt changes and compared them to estimated precipitation vs potential evapotranspiration p pet data for time windows ranging from 1 to 10 years to estimate possible trends and or changes thereof in evaporative demand we looked at the four primary meteorological variables wind speed atmospheric humidity radiation and air temperature as these have been shown to be particularly relevant in long term water resource assessments mcvicar et al 2012 at the varėna meteorological station net radiation is not measured which prevented the application of penmans s or priestly taylor equations sumner and jacobs 2005 to estimate evapotranspiration we therefore used an equation based on air temperature in which potential evaporation rates are obtained via empirical relationships donohue et al 2010 in concrete terms and for the purpose of our study thornthwaite s equation thornthwaite 1948 has been applied as follows 1 pet 16 10 t i a where t represents average monthly temperature i is a heat index for a given area which is the sum of 12 monthly index values i and where a is an empirically derived exponent as a function of i 2 i t 5 1 514 3 a 0 000000675 i 3 0 0000771 i 2 0 01792 i 0 49239 to model pet in the čepkeliai peatland we used average monthly temperature from the varėna meteorological station the difference d between p and pet provides a simple means to measure water surplus or deficit for the analysed time window vicente serrano et al 2010 4 d i p i pet i based on this equation we estimate that roughly 69 of total precipitation is lost through evapotranspiration in čepkeliai of which 82 takes place in during the vegetation period of trees which is locally lasting from late may to late september on average the annual potential evapotranspiration is about 469 mm relations between p pet and iwt were thereafter modeled through regression estimates and used to reconstruct wt changes for the period of available meteorological data 3 2 relation between trw and wt in a second step relations between modeled mean annual water table mwt according to the p pet analyses were contrasted with annual tree growth to extend the hydroclimatic reconstruction further back in time to minimize the influence of non climatic variations and trends related to tree age and geometry the trw data was standardised and transformed into dimensionless trw indices fritts 1976 cook and kairiukstis 1990 using the arstan 41d software cook and krusic 2006 to preserve potential low frequency variations in tree growth a flexible friedman s variable span smoother friedman 1984 was used for standardization reliability of the trw chronologies and the common variance of the single series were evaluated with the expressed population signal eps wigley et al 1984 and running rbar cook and kairiukstis 1990 respectively the limit at which the records were considered reliable and well replicated was set to the commonly accepted threshold of eps 0 85 wigley et al 1984 three different trw chronologies were created using arstan 41d a raw trw chronology raw a standardised trw chronology std and a residual trw chronology res pearson correlation analysis was used to estimate the relationship between trw series std chronology and wt fluctuations lagged correlations between hydrological meteorological and dendrochronological data were computed to quantify potential lag effects nonlinearity between trw and mwt was taken into account by nonlinear regression segmented regression with a breakpoint at the vertex of best fit second order polynomial curve was used to establish the interval of wt fluctuations in which linear regression model could be applied 3 3 wt reconstruction using trw data separate calibration 1986 2012 and independent verification 1935 1964 periods were used to validate the wt reconstruction models based on our trw series developed from the peatland pines the trw based water table reconstruction trwwt was considered only for that period for which trw data were reliable and statistically robust nemunas river runoff data was thereafter used to validate the wt reconstructions obtained for the čepkeliai raised bog 4 results and interpretation 4 1 wt reconstruction derived from p pet assessment the correlation values 2002 2014 between annual instrumental water table iwt measurements in the different wells shown in fig 2 and the ratio of precipitation vs potential evapotranspiration p pet for periods ranging from 1 to 10 years are presented in table 2 the strongest correlation coefficient r 0 92 p 0 00001 was observed between average annual iwt at well 4 a located closest to the lagg and p pet over 7 years the following regression model was used for estimates of wt fluctuations from the p pet 5 wt 0 0014 σ 7 p pet 130 79 estimates from this model were then used to extend the wt series at the lagg well 4 a for the period 1935 2002 according to our reconstructions the wt fluctuated from 133 3 m a s l to 132 1 m a s l this means that the wt has been 20 cm above the zero level in wet years at the bog lagg and that its surroundings were subject to flooding at the other extreme in very dry years the wt at well 4 a was 100 cm below the level of the peat surface 4 2 relations of trw with wt after crossdating and evaluation of the trw series 50 out of 96 trees were included in the final trw chronologies used for wt reconstructions the relatively high rejection rate of samples 48 is related to the large number of missing rings in many tree ring samples the final trw chronologies and related sample depth over time are presented in fig 3 the eps values of the raw raw standardised std and residual res trw chronologies are above the critical threshold of 0 85 between 1870 and 2014 for all series strongest correlation has been obtained between the measured wt at well 4 a and the std trw chronology a lag effect between tree growth and water level in the peatland was detected as the strongest relation between trw and mwt which was obtained with a 2 year lag in the trw record moreover the 2 year lag between trw and mwt revealed a nonlinear dependence between the two parameters fig 4 nevertheless mwt could be segmented into two distinct intervals with a threshold at the vertex of the best fit curve i e at 132 6 m a s l i e 50 cm below the peat surface as characterized by different response of trw to wt fluctuations linear negative dependence r 0 57 of trw with mwt was observed when mwt fluctuated within a 50 cm layer below the peat surface but this relation vanished and even turned to insignificantly positive after the mwt dropped below the 50 cm threshold fig 5 our records show a dry period with water levels below 132 6 m a s l between 1965 and 1985 at the beginning of this phase tree growth was fairly moderate before a growth depression started to emerge in the 1970s followed by a gradual recovery up to 1981 with the exception of the period just described before negative correlations between mwt and std trw chronology was observed suggesting that increasing peat moisture limited tree growth at the peatland the strongest significant correlation coefficient r 0 604 p 0 00001 was computed between mwt and std trw chronology with an offset of 2 yrs in trw indices see table 3 which supports the idea that the wt fluctuations have a delayed influence on radial tree growth the correlation tests show that any rise in water table results in depressed tree radial growth which is visible in the form of narrower annual growth rings except for the extremely dry period 1965 1985 in fig 6 we compare std trw indices and mwt values with their low frequency components i e a 5 yr moving average in general terms those periods associated with depressed radial growth correspond with phases with high water levels as was the case for instance during 1935 1939 1945 1950 1958 1963 1983 1994 and ever since 2004 opposite conditions were recorded for periods with low water tables during 1939 1945 1953 1956 and to a lesser extent 1995 2003 during these phases relatively dry conditions allowed better growth in trees the only exception is observed for the period 1965 1985 as this interval was characterized by water table levels 132 6 m a s l the latter did not trigger any specific trends in tree growth 4 3 wt reconstruction based on trw data a significant correlation was obtained between wt fluctuations as derived from p pet analyses for well 4 a and the std trw chronology p 0 00001 provided that the dry period comprised between 1965 and 1985 was excluded from analyses the linear regression model between both datasets was calibrated over the period 1986 2012 whereas the time window 1935 1964 was used for independent model verification the correlation coefficient between mwt and std trw chronology using an offset of 2 years is r 0 602 p 0 001 for the calibration period 1986 2012 and the linear regression model is expressed as follows 6 trwwt t 0 9564 std t 2 133 91 where trwwtt is the reconstructed wt based on trw in year t and stdt 2 is the tree ring std index with a 2 yr offset for the verification period correlation between observed and estimated wt fluctuations is 0 691 p 0 0001 based on the significance of this test our model was thereafter used to estimate wt levels at the site between 1870 and 1935 fig 7 periods with high water tables 133 0 m a s l or 0 1 m below the peat surface were reconstructed for the phases 1870 1873 1879 1888 1902 1910 1915 1919 1926 1939 1947 1950 1957 1963 1983 1990 and since 2005 low water tables 132 8 m a s l or 0 3 m below the peat surface were detected in 1874 1878 1889 1897 1920 1926 1940 1946 1952 1956 and 1995 2003 noteworthy our tree ring records are not able to reproduce prolonged periods of low water tables during which values drop below 132 6 m a s l to validate our hydrological reconstructions the čepkeliai wt data was compared to mean annual runoff data from the nemunas river at smalininkai gauging station runoff data is assumed here to represent the common hydrological situation for the entire nemunas catchment area fig 8 reconstructed long term changes for the hydrological regime at čepkeliai raised bog which is located in the central course of nemunas river are significantly correlated with river runoff data r 0 39 p 0 00001 1870 2014 the agreement between the reconstructed trwwt and nemunas runoff data further underline the robustness of our reconstruction periods with high wt correspond to narrow growth rings in the trw records and years with large overall runoff this coherence suggests that trw data developed from peatland pine trees can be used as a proxy of wt levels in peatlands the only exception was the prolonged and exceptionally dry period in which the link between trw and wt disappeared 5 discussion 5 1 wt reconstruction based on p pet the different calculation models considered in this study have allowed comparison of different approaches in a field for which data is still scarce and knowledge of processes and drivers remains fragmentary the application of thornthwaite s equation based exclusively on a temperature relationship has certain limitations and at bests a theoretical justification taylor and ashcroft 1972 since temperature and vapour pressure gradients are related to the movement of air as well as to the heating of the soil the validity of the equation should not be generalized moreover the equation has to be tested empirically whenever the climate is appreciably different from the area in which it has been tested originally skaggs 1980 nokes 1995 xu and singh 2001 we opted for thornthwaite s equation due to a lack of more complete input data but also because earlier studies by taminskas et al 2008a have obtained a reliable relationship r2 from 0 57 to 0 62 between observed actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration in a set of sites close to our study site in that study the utility of thornthwaite s estimates towards a reconstruction of variability in evapotranspiration was tested by comparing results according to thornthwaite s equation with the same month weighing lysimeter method estimates of actual evapotranspiration at three locations fig 9 our study has also demonstrated the crucial role of a dense wt monitoring network so as to accurately reconstruct wt fluctuations in peat bogs indeed correlations between p pet trw data and raised bog wt fluctuations obviously depend on piezometer location table 2 in our case the strongest correlation was obtained at the raised bog lagg which is characterized by a lack of surface runoff the lagg is located in the lowest part of the bog and might therefore be the best location for the assessment of water resources in the bog water system howie and meerveld 2011 strong correlation coefficients between precipitation and iwt in the lagg further indicate that water level in the lagg depends more on the annual amount of precipitation than wt fluctuations in the raised bog slope or in the mineral soil surrounding the peat bog interestingly the lowest correlation coefficients were recorded between p pet and annual iwt in well 6 a located on the bog slope at a distance of 150 m from the bog margin fig 2 the steepest slope in bog surface along the cross section analyzed is located close to this well and the higher influence of surface runoff at this location apparently determines a decline in the correlation coefficient in this area most often the slope gradient on the bog surface declines as soon as the distance from bog margin increases bog surface is indeed close to flat in the area where well 3 a is located at a distance of 340 m from the bog margin fig 2 in this area wt is linked to p pet rather than surface runoff from other areas in the bog complex an increase in the correlation coefficient between iwt and p pet is therefore observed again and an increase in correlation is observed between iwt recorded in well 4 g located on sand dunes and p pet as compared to well 6 a inside the bog and p pet table 2 the water level in well 4 g is however most likely affected by both water supply from the bog and groundwater levels in the bog margins stronger correlations have been observed between annual iwt and p pet in wells located in the lagg and on the raised bog as compared to well 4 g located on sand dunes table 2 furthermore comparison between well 4 g and the wells located at the bog surface shows that water level varies differently inside the bog and on mineral soil sites over the year this may depend on differences in groundwater recharge in the wells on the bog and mineral soil especially during the dry season of the year iwt data from the bog wells is therefore more suitable for trw analysis than is iwt data from wells located on mineral soils outside the bog this observation is in agreement with comparisons between pine trees growing under identical climatic conditions but different soil moisture edvardsson et al 2015a even though the trees sometimes grew only a hundred meter apart correlation was often close to absent between the trw series from the mineral and peat soil pines our studies are also in agreement with results from howie and meerved 2011 suggesting that wt in a bog lagg is more integrated indicator of hydrological regime in the wetland 5 2 trw relations with wt changes in general wt changes in peat bogs are mainly controlled by precipitation but they also tend to be influenced by temperature controlled evapo transpi ration charman et al 2004 several studies have shown that peat bogs can indeed act as water reservoirs thereby buffering water and that wt fluctuations in peat bogs therefore can lag several years behind climatic or environmental changes kilian et al 1995 linderholm et al 2002 edvardsson and hansson 2015 this lag may also explain the delayed response that is sometimes recorded in trw records to climate changes especially if the series are developed from pines growing on raised bogs vaganov and kachaev 1992 edvardsson et al 2015a in this study the strongest correlation was computed between total p pet over 7 years and std trw chronology with a 2 yr lag our results also confirm that tree growth in peatlands reflects the multiannual synthesis of moisture variability as well as a hydrological lag and or feedback responses linderholm et al 2002 edvardsson et al 2015a edvardsson and hansson 2015 wt fluctuations within the peat bog are the main driver of radial growth of bog pines the 2 yr lag observed in our records table 3 is consistent with results from the männikjärve peat bog in estonia smiljanic et al 2014 lagged responses of about 3 yrs were detected between the increases in moisture derived from δ13c isotopes in annual tree rings and decreased radial growth of subfossil pine trees in two swedish bogs edvardsson et al 2014 drivers of lag responses can be related to the progressive inhibition of root formation or root decay in water saturated environments or the availability of nutrients in peaty substrates which have been shown to be highly dependent on the activity of decomposing microbes or mycorrhizae fungi kozlowski 1997 pallardy 2008 these processes however all depend on wt fluctuations as well dimitrov et al 2010 physiological adaptation of peatland pines to extremely wet conditions and shortage of nutrients e g peculiarities in carbohydrates storage system could also influence the existence of a slower reaction to environmental changes kozlowski 1997 studies on the contribution of different carbon sources on tree growth show rather variable ratios of new carbohydrates versus remobilised reserves from previous years ranging from 71 to 35 brüggemann et al 2011 but experiments on bog pines are still lacking edvardsson et al 2016 whether and to which degree carbon allocation and carbon fluxes in the plant soil system are affected by environmental stress conditions remains one of the research questions in this field brüggemann et al 2011 water saturated peat soils create unfavourable conditions for tree growth due to a number of physical chemical and biological processes kozlowski 1997 linderholm et al 2002 edvardsson et al 2016 most often increased peat moisture result in depressed tree growth which can be analysed a posteriori through the presence of narrower annual growth rings smiljanic et al 2014 edvardsson et al 2015a high water tables also restrict the development of tree roots to the upper aerobic peat layers coutts 1982 kozlowski 1997 leuschner et al 2007 and therefore limit the nutrient pool available for trees in an already nutrient limited environment ohlson 1995 moreover low oxygen levels in peat soils can favor oxygen deficiency in the upper plant tissues and can thus cause inhibition of plant growth boggie 1977 the growth patterns observed in this study are in line with these findings but also suggest that tree growth can be depressed during extremely dry phases as well similar to smiljanic et al 2014 we observe that extremely low water levels may cause growth stress as well a fact which may result from the shallow and horizontal spreading root systems of peat trees edvardsson et al 2016 in our study a weak positive link between mwt and std trw chronology indices was observed during the unusually dry period 1965 1985 during which the wt was as low as 132 6 m a s l or even lower i e the average annual depth of the water table was 50 cm below the peat surface although the water level started to rise again in 1978 the drought signal in the trw data persisted for some more years in times with low wt the surface layers of peat dry out leaving the shallow roots in the top peat layers with very limited access to water and hence expose the trees to drought stress braekke 1983 dang and lieffers 1989 pepin et al 2002 we hypothesize that during these dry periods trw will depend less on hydrological drivers taking into consideration recent global warming and the projected intensification of extremes rimkus et al 2011 stonevičius et al 2017 one may expect more frequent droughts in the study region and thus also increased drought stress on bog trees indeed our wt reconstructions show enhanced amplitudes of wt fluctuations in the second half of the 20th century 5 3 wt reconstruction based on trw the development of a 130 year wt reconstruction from peatland trw data represents the core of this study and an important step to a more widespread application of a new proxy record for moisture variability in peatland ecosystems far beyond the period covered by monitoring data such proxy records are important due to the close relation of hydrology with carbon sequestration in peatland ecosystems in general terms our results show that moister conditions generate harsher growth conditions for bog trees and are thus in line with previous findings leuschner et al 2002 edvardsson et al 2016 at the same time however our findings also indicate that unusually dry conditions may result in unfavorable growth conditions as well once that the wt falls below a threshold of 50 cm beneath the peat surface trw indices will no longer remain statistically dependent on wt depth in other words as soon as wt fluctuations fall 50 cm below the peat surface trw records will fail to significantly estimate past wt fluctuations under current conditions such conditions must however be considered as quite exceptional to reconstruct wt depths during such extremely dry periods as well one needs to take alternative proxies into consideration by way of example stable isotopes in tree rings may offer an opportunity however isotope studies on peatland trees have remained rather limited so far sass klaassen et al 2005 edvardsson et al 2014 in the case of proxies without annually resolved proxies like e g testate amoebae could thus be added to strengthen wt reconstructions especially in a longer term perspective hendon and charman 2004 van bellen et al 2014 lamentowicz et al 2015 despite the limitations of trw data to reconstruct mwt fluctuations during extreme droughts statistically significant correlation between our reconstruction and the instrumental nemunas runoff data suggests that trw records from peatland pines can indeed be used as a reliable proxy of past wt variability in peatlands moreover the reconstructed wt fluctuations in the čepkeliai raised bog correspond to periods which are associated with dry wet conditions known from the literature balevičius et al 1984 taminskas et al 2008a b 6 conclusions the radial growth of peatland pine trees is strongly influenced by wt fluctuations which in turn depend on changes in precipitation and temperature in our case the strongest correlation between average annual iwt and p pet totals has been obtained if the latter was considered for a period of 7 years further strong correlations were obtained between mwt and std trw chronology with a 2 yr lag while this lagged response sustains the findings in other raised bog studies more thorough investigations are necessary to really understand the eco physiological factors predetermining time lags in peatland ecosystem functioning the negative dependence of trw on wt fluctuations was found in this study as well provided that the latter fluctuated within a 50 cm layer below the peat surface by contrast the correlation quickly fades as soon as the wt drops below this threshold consequently and in case of extremely low water levels narrow trw may be formed as well which could possibly result in some bias moreover a weak correlation was observed between very low wt and trw suggesting a shift in limiting factors from a moisture limited radial increment to a growth depending on other limiting environmental factors despite these limitations trw series from pine trees were used successfully in this study as a valuable proxy to reconstruct wt fluctuations in the bog lagg zone in addition the reliability of trw chronologies is further demonstrated by the significant correlation observed between our reconstruction and nemunas runoff series considering the widespread availability of pine remains in peat deposits of boreo nemoral peat bogs edvardsson et

7467,to address certain limitations with their current operational model environment and climate change canada recently developed the soil vegetation and snow svs land surface model and the representation of subsurface hydrological processes was targeted as an area for improvement the objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of hydrosvs the component of svs responsible for the vertical redistribution of water to simulate soil moisture under snow free conditions when using flux tower observations of evapotranspiration as forcing data we assessed 1 model fidelity by comparing soil moisture modelled with hydrosvs to point scale measurements of volumetric soil water content and 2 model complexity by comparing the performance of hydrosvs to that of hydrogeosphere a state of the art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model to do this we performed one dimensional soil column simulations at four sites of the ameriflux network results indicate that under mediterranean and temperate climates hydrosvs satisfactorily simulated soil moisture nash sutcliffe efficiency between 0 26 and 0 70 r2 0 80 with a performance comparable to hydrogeosphere nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 60 r2 0 80 however hydrosvs performed weakly under a semiarid climate while hydrogeosphere performed relatively well by decoupling the magnitude and sourcing of evapotranspiration this study proposes a powerful diagnostic tool to evaluate the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in land surface models overall this study highlights the potential of svs for hydrological applications keywords soil moisture land surface model svs hydrogeosphere 1 introduction land surface models describe the interactions between the atmosphere and the land surface by simulating exchanges of momentum heat and water within the earth system land surface models provide the bottom boundary conditions for atmospheric models and are a key element of numerical weather prediction systems and climate change projection modelling the ability of land surface models to capture hydrological processes is crucial to represent land atmosphere coupling clark et al 2015a maxwell et al 2007 subsurface hydrological processes are particularly important for modelling land atmosphere interactions because soil moisture plays a key role in modulating fluxes and stores of water and energy indeed soil moisture reflects precipitation storage constrains evapotranspiration under water limiting conditions and influences the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and runoff seneviratne et al 2010 despite their importance for land atmosphere coupling subsurface hydrological processes have typically been represented in a simplified form in many land surface models clark et al 2015a davison et al 2016 in particular operational land surface models geared towards weather forecasting tend to simplify the representation of hydrological processes to minimize computational costs environment and climate change canada currently uses a modified version of the interactions between soil biosphere and atmosphere isba land surface model to produce operational weather forecasts accordingly the isba model provides surface fluxes of momentum water and energy to the global environmental multiscale gem atmospheric model in isba soil moisture is modelled using a force restore approach involving only two soil layers extending to the assumed root depth bélair et al 2003 to address certain limitations with isba environment and climate change canada developed the soil vegetation and snow svs land surface model with the representation of subsurface hydrological processes targeted as an area for improvement in the hydrological module of svs hydrosvs the soil column is now represented with increased vertical resolution and the vertical movement of water through the soil is now described using a finite difference solution of richards equation for unsaturated flow alavi et al 2016 two studies recently compared the performance of svs and isba in offline mode and found that modifications implemented in svs improved the simulation of soil moisture and brightness temperature during the warm season over the north american domain alavi et al 2016 husain et al 2016 with these improvements svs coupled with a routing scheme now offers a computationally efficient tool for hydrological prediction for example svs coupled to the watroute routing scheme yielded a runoff simulation performance similar to two widely used distributed hydrological models mesh and watflood for the lake ontario watershed gaborit et al 2017 moreover land surface models also offer a tool for hydrologists to better integrate land atmosphere interactions in hydrological modelling see for instance maxwell et al 2007 soulis et al 2000 zabel and mauser 2013 various model evaluation and comparison initiatives have been undertaken in the land surface modelling community and have fuelled their rapid evolution henderson sellers et al 1995 1993 van den hurk et al 2011 while two studies have recently evaluated the global performance of svs at the continental scale alavi et al 2016 husain et al 2016 relevant diagnostics that can pinpoint problematic parameterization of processes are also needed for example point scale assessments are essential to answer questions regarding the ability of a model to capture the temporal and spatial variability of certain variables such as soil moisture an efficient evaluation of model fidelity in reproducing observations often relies on the isolation of individual processes clark et al 2015b as such in the present study subsurface hydrological processes infiltration percolation vegetation water uptake are specifically targeted while most studies generally focus on evaluating model fidelity e g the ability of the model to reproduce observations a joint evaluation of model fidelity and complexity facilitates a clear assessment of trade offs between different modelling options for instance potential performance gains associated with increased complexity can be evaluated in light of their added computational cost building upon previous evaluations of svs at a continental scale the objective of the present study is to evaluate the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in hydrosvs this study focuses on the performance of hydrosvs at the point scale over a multiyear horizon to do so we follow an evaluation framework that 1 isolates subsurface hydrological processes by targeting study sites that are part of the ameriflux network where measured surface fluxes such as evapotranspiration can be used as forcing data 2 evaluates model fidelity by comparing soil moisture modelled with hydrosvs to point scale measurements at various depths and 3 assesses model complexity by comparing the soil moisture modelling performance of hydrosvs to hydrogeosphere a state of the art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model 2 study area 2 1 description of ameriflux sites we selected four study sites from the ameriflux network baldocchi et al 2001 where surface fluxes were measured using the eddy covariance method fig 1 ameriflux sites are all subject to a series of data harmonization and quality control measures that facilitate site intercomparison the following criteria were used for site selection 1 volumetric soil water content measurements available at multiple depths and for multiple years 2 absence of snow cover to specifically target warm season subsurface hydrological processes and 3 representation of contrasting climates and vegetation types table 1 describes the four study sites and their associated climates semiarid mediterranean temperate and vegetation types grassland woody savanna deciduous broadleaf forest evergreen needleleaf forest in terms of climate and seasonality a semiarid climate prevails at us wkg and 60 of the annual precipitation occurs during the north american monsoon in july august and september moran et al 2009a scott et al 2010 the us ton site is characterized by a mediterranean climate and precipitation largely occurs during the winter months october to may with very little rainfall during the summer the us mrf site also has a mediterranean climate with a relatively dry summer but precipitation during the wet winter months is about three times greater than at us ton the us wbw site has a temperate climate with a year round supply of precipitation precipitation and water vapor flux data at a 30 min time step were extracted from the ameriflux database http ameriflux lbl gov baldocchi et al 2001 soil moisture data were extracted from the cdiac hosted database carbon dioxide information analysis center http cdiac esd ornl gov programs ameriflux data system aamer html given that observations were available at multiple depths unlike the typical two measurement levels found in the ameriflux database across the study sites soil moisture was measured with a variety of probes that generally derive volumetric soil water content by measuring an electrical property of the soil more specifically theta ml2 x probes delta t devices were deployed at us ton and us wbw miller et al 2007 stevens water hydra probe sensors at us wkg keefer et al 2008 and campbell scientific cs615 probes at us mrf kwon et al 2017 measurement accuracy typically ranges between 0 01 and 0 05 m3 m 3 for the sensors used 3 methodology 3 1 description of the svs model a detailed description of hydrosvs the hydrology scheme of svs can be found in alavi et al 2016 in hydrosvs the vertical movement of water is described by the one dimensional richards equation for unsaturated flow in a porous medium soulis et al 2000 the evolution of moisture in soil layers is described using the conservation equation 1 θ t f z s where θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 f is the water flux kg m 2 s 1 and s is the sink source term kg m 2 s 1 that includes precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff lateral flow base flow at the bottom of the soil layer as well as snow runoff melting and freezing the water flux f z t at depth z and time t is described by darcy s law 2 f z t k v z t ψ z 1 where k v z t is the vertical hydraulic conductivity m s 1 and ψ z t is the soil water potential m in hydrosvs eq 1 is solved numerically using a fourth order runge kutta finite difference method the soil column is discretized into soil layers whose depth and exact number can be defined by the user and the water flux between each layer can be computed with darcy s law the relationship between soil water content soil water potential and relative permeability follows the clapp and hornberger 1978 model among sink and source terms the evaporation and transpiration fluxes are typically derived from the svs simulation of the energy budget using a force restore approach husain et al 2016 accordingly each grid cell is divided into the three surface types found in the model bare ground low vegetation and high vegetation and a distinct energy budget is computed for each surface type instead in this study we used the eddy covariance measured water vapor flux as a forcing to the model see section 3 4 for a description of the boundary conditions with the exception of the semiarid site us wkg we assumed a land cover consisting exclusively of high vegetation in the absence of information on evapotranspiration partitioning into evaporation soil and wet canopy and transpiration we assumed that at these sites us ton us mrf us wbw the surface water vapor flux occurred exclusively through transpiration as such soil evaporation and interception were considered negligible at the semiarid site us wkg where vegetation is sparse and transpiration accounts for 79 of evapotranspiration during the monsoon period moran et al 2009b we assumed land cover was made up of bare soil at 25 and low vegetation at 75 accordingly bare soil evaporation i e 25 of the observed evapotranspiration used as forcing was removed from the top soil layer and the remaining flux occurred through transpiration as it is the case for the three other sites at all sites water uptake from transpiration was distributed over the soil column as a function of the root profile and transpiration reduction function 3 t z et obs r z f θ where t z is the evapotranspiration rate kg m 2 s 1 at depth z m et obs is observed evapotranspiration kg m 2 s 1 as measured at the flux tower r z is the root distribution function and f θ is the transpiration reduction function the proportion of roots in a soil layer n corresponds to 4 r z r z n r z n 1 where r z n is the fraction of roots above the soil layer depth z n m and is described using the equation proposed by schenk and jackson 2003 5 r z n 1 1 z n z 50 c where z 50 is the depth m above which 50 of roots are found and c is a shape parameter z 50 was set to about 40 of the maximum root depth 0 5 m at us wkg 0 3 m at us ton 1 m at us mrf 0 25 at us wbw the shape parameter c was derived from z 50 and the maximum root depth see husain et al 2016 the transpiration reduction function was parameterized as a step function given that observed rather than potential evapotranspiration was provided as a forcing 6 f θ 0 for θ θ wp 1 for θ θ wp where θ wp is the volumetric soil water content at wilting point m3 m 3 accordingly if soil moisture fell below the wilting point evapotranspiration was stopped for that soil layer and we assumed that the evapotranspiration that could not be fulfilled i e the difference between the forcing data and the modelled evapotranspiration would be supplied by water from deeper layers i e at depths greater than the maximum rooting depth this assumption appeared reasonable given the uncertainty in describing the maximum rooting depth i e using information from the literature for a single species as well as evidence that trees can tap water from deep soil layers or even groundwater miller et al 2010 thompson et al 2011 3 2 description of the hydrogeosphere model as a state of the art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model hydrogeosphere hgs offers a benchmark against which to compare hydrosvs hgs is an integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model that simultaneously solves for two dimensional overland flow and three dimensional variably saturated flow aquanty 2013 overland surface flow is simulated with the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equations and subsurface variably saturated flow is simulated with a modified form of richards equation the equations are discretized with the control volume finite element mode forsyth 1991 the surface and subsurface domains are coupled with the dual node approach which uses a first order exchange coefficient between the domains the relationship between soil water content soil water potential and relative permeability is described using the van genuchten 1980 model a detailed description of equations and their numerical implementation is found in aquanty 2013 previous studies have successfully used hgs to simulate soil moisture and the model showed an excellent ability to capture spatio temporal dynamics in a small catchment koch et al 2016 moreover the model was part of an initiative for surface subsurface model intercomparison and it successfully simulated soil saturation in a benchmark test case maxwell et al 2014 in hgs the kristensen and jensen 1975 model is implemented to simulate transpiration and evaporation as a function of potential evapotranspiration and water availability at each node within the root and evaporation zones however in this study eddy covariance measurements of evapotranspiration were used as an input to the model see section 3 4 for a description of the boundary conditions similar to the hydrosvs simulations we assumed that soil evaporation and interception were negligible and that only transpiration occurred as described in eq 3 in hgs the root distribution function r z followed a cubic law between the surface and the maximum root depth since the actual relationship at each site is unknown the transpiration reduction function f θ was parametrized either as a step function eq 6 or as a linear function according to 7 f θ 0 for θ θ wp θ θ wp θ fc θ wp for θ wp θ θ fc 1 for θ θ fc where θ fc is the volumetric soil water content at field capacity m3 m 3 according to eq 7 if soil moisture falls below field capacity transpiration is reduced and modelled evapotranspiration is thus smaller than the observed evapotranspiration used as forcing data moreover only soil water over the root zone is available for transpiration and the hgs model cannot tap deep soil layers to feed the transpiration flux 3 3 model setup hydrosvs and hgs were both set up to perform one dimensional soil column simulations fig 2 we chose to discretize the soil differently in order to reflect how each model is typically set up for operational applications in hydrosvs the soil column was 3 meter deep and divided into seven soil layers at depths of 5 10 20 40 100 200 and 300 cm in hgs the soil column was 1 meter deep and the vertical grid resolution was set to 1 cm throughout the entire column since all soil moisture measurements were performed in the first meter from the surface we constrained the hgs simulations to a one meter soil column to minimize simulation times about one hour with hgs compared to a few seconds for hydrosvs table 2 lists soil and vegetation properties shared by the two models although soil properties are known to vary with depth we assigned uniform properties for soil texture throughout the soil column since information at multiple depths was not available soil texture information was taken from the literature or metadata from the ameriflux database soil porosity was set as the maximum soil water content observed nearest to the surface at each site root depth was determined from data in the literature site specific information on root distribution was used at us wbw wilson et al 2001 while a site specific optimized maximum root depth from ichii et al 2009 was used for us ton for the two other sites maximum root depth was estimated based on the maximum root depth of the dominant species at the site as found in the literature douglas fir at us mrf in mcminn 1963 and lehmann lovegrass at us wkg in gibbens and lenz 2001 table 3 identifies key differences between soil hydraulic properties used by the two models both models used the same soil texture as input data table 2 but differences arise since we chose to use the expressions currently implemented hydrosvs or most commonly used hgs for each model to translate texture into hydraulic properties in hydrosvs saturated hydraulic conductivity is computed from the soil s sand content using the expression derived by brooks and corey 1966 hydraulic conductivity is assumed to exponentially decay with depth in hydrosvs alavi et al 2016 while we set it up as constant in hgs simulations for hgs simulations we derived saturated hydraulic conductivity and residual saturation using soil texture as an input to the rosetta model schaap et al 2002 however when the observed minimum soil water content was inferior to the rosetta computed residual saturation as was the case for two sites us wkg and us ton residual saturation was set according to the observed minimum soil water content in hydrosvs the wilting point is calculated based on the clay content of the soil table 2 using empirical equations in boone et al 1999 and the field capacity is obtained using the parameterization described by soulis et al 2011 this method assumes that field capacity is reached through drainage of an initially saturated soil until a vertical gradient of soil moisture is established such that water potential balances out gravity in hgs we defined the wilting point and field capacity as the soil water content corresponding to 1 5 and 0 033 mpa respectively based on the water retention curve models also differed in the expression of the water retention curve and relative permeability for both models soil texture information table 2 was used to derive parameters describing these relationships but different models were used clapp and hornberger model in hydrosvs and van genuchten model in hgs see sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 4 initial and boundary conditions we defined initial subsurface conditions with soil water content measurements taken at three or more depths depending on data availability at each site we used linear interpolation between soil moisture observations to assign initial conditions for the rest of the soil column for initial surface conditions we assumed a surface water depth of zero simulations were performed for a five year period with the exception of us wbw where data were only available for 2 5 years precipitation and gap filled evapotranspiration observations at a 30 min time step were used as boundary conditions for the two models indeed we bypassed the internal computation of evapotranspiration within models and we rather used eddy covariance measurements of evapotranspiration as forcing data gap filling of evapotranspiration was either performed with the reddyproc web tool reichstein et al 2005 us wkg us mrf us wbw or gap filled data were already available from the cdiac database us ton in hydrosvs water exited the model domain as surface runoff when either surface soil moisture exceeds saturation or when the precipitation rate exceeds saturated hydraulic conductivity at the surface hence infiltration capacity outflow at the bottom of the soil column occurred when soil water content exceeded field capacity and was computed with the expression developed by soulis et al 2011 eq 12 in hgs we applied a critical depth boundary at the surface to allow overland flow to exit the model domain and we applied a unit vertical hydraulic gradient at the bottom of the soil column to allow free drainage 3 5 modelling performance we evaluated the adequacy between observed and simulated values of soil water content with a series of metrics we computed the root mean square error rmse which assesses the variance of the model error we computed the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for which the optimal value is 1 and a value inferior to 0 indicates that the mean observed soil water content offers a better predictor than the model we computed the coefficient of determination r2 which is the squared value of the pearson coefficient of correlation this metric assesses the proportion of the total variance in observations that is explained by the model we computed the percent bias pbias which measures the average tendency of simulated soil water content to be larger or smaller than observations the optimal value is 0 and a positive negative value indicates an overestimation underestimation bias 4 results metrics describing the agreement between observed and modelled soil water content are presented in table 4 these metrics are presented for the middle soil layers which correspond to measurement depths of 15 20 30 and 20 cm at us wkg us ton us mrf and us wbw respectively it should be noted that these metrics were computed by comparing soil water content measurements at a single depth to modelled values corresponding to the average soil moisture over a certain soil depth depth 10 cm at us wkg and 20 cm at other sites 4 1 soil moisture modelling under a semiarid climate us wkg at the us wkg site the mean annual precipitation was 324 mm during the study period with 2013 being the driest year 264 mm and 2014 the wettest year 415 mm fig 3 a during the study period 2010 2014 2010 experienced an unusually wet winter with 110 mm in the first five months of the year compared to an average of 36 mm for the other years the performance of hydrosvs was weak at the semiarid site as illustrated by the negative value of the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse 2 69 table 4 during the dry season january to june soil moisture was completely depleted near the surface 0 5 cm in the hydrosvs simulations fig 3b while a minimum of 0 02 m3 m 3 was observed during dry periods hydrosvs simulated a soil water content of 0 m3 m 3 in four out of five years on the other hand the hgs simulation was able to capture the residual water content during dry periods and soil water content did not go below 0 05 m3 m 3 near the surface for deeper soil layers 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm fig 3c d soil moisture was generally overestimated in hydrosvs simulations with a mean value of 0 21 m3 m 3 at 10 20 cm over the five year period in comparison to a mean observed soil water content of 0 10 m3 m 3 at 15 cm for the same period excluding the 2010 217 to 2011 365 period given the gap in observations indeed the percent bias for the mid layer was 53 table 4 the only exception to this overestimation was the post 2010 monsoon period when simulated soil water content fell to 0 m3 m 3 in the 10 20 cm layer although observed soil water content never went below 0 1 m3 m 3 at a 15 cm depth the hgs model fared much better than hydrosvs at the deeper soil layers 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm fig 3c d hgs simulations of soil moisture captured the observed variability in soil moisture at the middle soil layer r2 0 56 table 4 but reduced performance was observed at the bottom soil layer r2 0 40 for example soil water content at 30 cm varied little during the 2013 monsoon period which did not match the hgs simulated increase in soil water content at the bottom layer 20 40 cm fig 3d 4 2 soil moisture modelling under a hot summer mediterranean climate us ton at us ton precipitation events were concentrated during winter months from october to may winter precipitation ranged between 511 and 557 mm during the study period with the exception of the wet winter of 2010 2011 when precipitation reached 814 mm fig 4 a hydrosvs overestimated soil moisture at all soil layers pbias 41 15 and 30 at the top middle and bottom soil layers although the model performed particularly well at the middle soil layer fig 4c nse 0 70 table 4 at the surface layer both models generally failed to predict soil water content above 0 45 m3 m 3 while the observed maximum soil water content reached 0 56 m3 m 3 fig 4b during dry months june to september hydrosvs largely overestimated soil moisture in the surface layer the minimum simulated soil water content was 0 16 m3 m 3 in the 0 5 cm layer while the observed minimum fell to 0 04 m3 m 3 at the surface fig 4b as a result of this overestimation soil moisture in the hydrosvs simulation never went below the wilting point 0 12 m3 m 3 table 3 in the bottom soil layer both models generally overestimated soil water content the minimum observed value at a 50 cm depth was 0 13 m3 m 3 while the minimum value modelled with hydrosvs was 0 20 m3 m 3 and 0 17 m3 m 3 with hgs for the zone at depths between 40 and 100 cm fig 4d 4 3 soil moisture modelling under a warm summer mediterranean climate us mrf the mean annual precipitation recorded at us mrf ranged between 964 in 2011 and 1337 in 2007 mm which was considerably lower than the long term annual average of 1820 mm fig 5 a the seasonal pattern was adequately captured by the two models and both hydrosvs and hgs were able to simulate the soil moisture decline during spring and summer months when vegetation was active in the middle and bottom soil layers soil moisture simulated with hydrosvs closely agreed with observations fig 5c d however similar to us ton soil moisture in the surface layer was overestimated by hydrosvs during drier months june to september the observed soil water content reached a minimum of 0 17 m3 m 3 at a depth of 10 cm while the simulated minimum was 0 24 m3 m 3 for the soil layer comprised between 10 and 20 cm accordingly soil moisture simulated with hydrosvs never fell below the wilting point 0 17 m3 m 3 table 3 following the rainy season october to may hgs adequately captured the soil moisture decline in the surface layer fig 5b but generally underestimated soil moisture during spring and summer months in the middle and bottom soil layers fig 5c d for example soil water content modelled with hgs at 20 40 cm dropped to 0 16 m3 m 3 while the observed minimum at a depth of 30 cm remained at 0 21 m3 m 3 both models also tended to underestimate peak soil moisture during the rainy season october to may and often failed to simulate soil water content above 0 40 m3 m 3 in the middle and bottom layers fig 5c d pbias 3 and 8 for hydrosvs and hgs table 4 towards the end of the study period second half of 2011 soil moisture appeared largely underestimated by the two models in the bottom soil layer fig 5d although we suspect that the sudden jump in soil moisture observations may be sensor related 4 4 soil moisture modelling under a temperate climate us wbw data were only available for 2 5 years at us wbw and the study period was characterized by a wet year in 2004 with 1600 mm of precipitation and a relatively dry year in 2005 with only 995 mm of precipitation fig 6 a both models satisfactorily captured the seasonal soil moisture pattern at us wbw characterized by maximum soil moisture during winter months and a decrease during spring and summer months when increased vegetation activity occurred fig 6 hydrosvs had difficulties capturing minimum soil moisture in the top and middle soil layers during the summer pbias 8 and 23 at the top and middle layers for example in the fall 2005 observed soil water content dropped to 0 05 m3 m 3 at a 5 cm depth while the minimum soil water content simulated by hydrosvs and hgs was respectively 0 16 m3 m 3 and 0 07 m3 m 3 in the top soil layer 0 5 cm fig 6a accordingly soil moisture never fell below the wilting point in the hydrosvs simulation θ wp 0 13 m 3 m 3 table 3 while it dropped slightly below the wilting point in the hgs simulation θ wp 0 07 m 3 m 3 table 3 unlike hydrosvs which adequately captured high soil water content values during the winter hgs generally underestimated soil water content in the middle soil layer during this period indeed observed soil water content generally remained above 0 25 m3 m 3 at 20 cm during the winter while hgs simulated soil water content hovered around 0 22 m3 m 3 for the soil layer ranging between 20 and 40 cm fig 6c still the two models were able to capture the short lived peaks in soil moisture during winter months at the bottom soil layer 40 100 cm fig 6 both models underestimated soil water content throughout the entire study period pbias 16 and 27 for hydrosvs and hgs for example while observed soil water content remained around 0 34 m3 m 3 during winter months simulated soil water content was generally below 0 30 m3 m 3 and 0 25 m3 m 3 for hydrosvs and hgs respectively however this underestimation could be due to a change in porosity at lower depths given that observed soil water content plateaued at lower values in surface layers 0 28 m3 m 3 at z 5 cm and 0 26 m3 m 3 at z 20 cm 5 discussion 5 1 tapping into flux tower networks to assess subsurface hydrological processes the ameriflux sites have largely been used to evaluate the representation of surface processes such as evapotranspiration in land surface models williams et al 2009 however the network also offers a great opportunity to isolate and evaluate subsurface processes evapotranspiration introduces considerable uncertainty in hydrological modelling seiller and anctil 2016 and numerous efforts have been dedicated to improve its simulation courault et al 2005 salvucci and gentine 2013 wang and bras 2011 the approach used in the present study provides new insight by decoupling two aspects of the evapotranspiration flux its magnitude and its sourcing indeed by providing data on the evapotranspiration magnitude the ameriflux dataset allowed us to focus on the sourcing portion of this flux while flux tower networks offer insight into the magnitude of water vapor fluxes eddy covariance measurements also tend to underestimate available energy with a mean imbalance of about 20 on an annual time scale stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 the energy imbalance problem is particularly acute with data at a half hourly time scale i e input data used in the present study and generally attenuates over a daily time scale leuning et al 2012 this energy imbalance may translate into an underestimation of evapotranspiration foken 2008 which could lead to an overestimation of soil moisture when using the observed evapotranspiration as forcing data in the present study no distinct pattern of under or overestimation emerged in simulations during periods of maximum evapotranspiration we observed an overestimation of soil moisture in the middle soil layer in hydrosvs simulations pbias between 15 and 53 except for 3 at us mrf table 4 while hgs generally performed well during these periods pbias between 8 and 10 table 4 thus suggesting that the input data were not responsible a larger sample size would be necessary to assess if the energy imbalance of eddy covariance measurements translates into a systematic bias in soil moisture modelling using observed evapotranspiration as forcing data an underestimation of evapotranspiration by eddy covariance measurements could also be potentially compensated by the wind induced undercatch of precipitation by rain gauges sevruk 1982 moreover a spatial mismatch can also arise between the location of soil moisture measurements and the footprint of flux tower observations of evapotranspiration indeed evapotranspiration measurements are representative of the region upwind of the flux tower typically within a distance of approximately 100 times the tower height and water availability could differ from soil moisture measurements at the foot of the flux tower such mismatch could translate into differences between observed evapotranspiration which is used as forcing data and evapotranspiration actually taking place at the soil column where moisture measurements are being performed 5 2 soil moisture modelling under a semiarid climate soil moisture modelling under a semiarid climate proved challenging for hydrosvs which resulted in a negative nash sutcliffe coefficient table 4 in the hydrosvs simulation soil moisture was underestimated and sometimes completely depleted near the surface during dry months while it was overestimated in deeper soil layers us wkg fig 3 given the ability of hgs to properly simulate soil moisture at this site the input data soil texture used to derive hydraulic soil properties do not appear to be a reasonable explanation of the relatively poor performance of hydrosvs in fact our ability to rule out this issue and raise questions about the model itself stems from our evaluation approach that not only relies on observations but also considers the comparison with another model reduced performance for hydrosvs could be in part explained by differences in water retention curve used by the two models indeed the hgs model relied on the van genuchten model to describe the water retention curve and this model involved an additional parameter residual saturation which is not part of the clapp and hornberger 1978 model implemented in hydrosvs soil moisture can thus become completely depleted in hydrosvs simulations largely as a result of drainage since evapotranspiration will stop when soil moisture goes below the wilting point instead minimum soil water content could not go below residual saturation in hgs simulations which could explain its enhanced performance during rain free periods it should also be noted that residual saturation defined in hgs simulations were adjusted based on soil moisture observations at us wkg which was not the case in hydrosvs simulations indeed residual saturation derived using soil texture data as input the rosetta model was 0 07 m3 m 3 and instead we set residual saturation to 0 02 m3 m 3 in the hgs simulation in order to match the observed minimum soil moisture when soil moisture observations are lacking to make such adjustments a correction to water retention curves could also be applied to avoid overestimation of residual soil moisture under arid climates ciocca et al 2014 5 3 soil moisture modelling under mediterranean and temperate climates under mediterranean and temperate climates hydrosvs provided realistic soil moisture time series when observed precipitation and evapotranspiration were used as inputs in general hydrosvs had a performance comparable to that of the integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model hgs model in fact increased complexity did not yield better results and hydrosvs even outperformed hgs at us mrf nse 0 70 with hydrosvs compared to nse 0 60 with hgs table 4 as such the vertical resolution in the soil column in hydrosvs appeared sufficient to capture soil moisture variability under mediterranean and temperate climates moreover simulation times for a five year period were in the order of seconds for hydrosvs in comparison to approximately one hour with hgs overall hydrosvs satisfactorily captured the time evolution of soil moisture following precipitation events and the model was able to reproduce maximum soil moisture conditions given the importance associated with the estimation of peak flows in hydrology this behavior appears particularly relevant when assessing the potential of hydrosvs for hydrological prediction gaborit et al 2017 demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the gem hydro platform where svs is combined with the watroute routing scheme for streamflow prediction in tributaries of lake ontario north america these results in terms of soil moisture and streamflow modelling are promising relative to the use of land surface models in hydrology the performance of both models hydrosvs and hgs was generally best for the middle soil layer at depths between 20 and 40 cm while the weakest performance was generally found for the bottom soil layer figs 4 6 the good agreement between observed and modelled values in the middle layers suggests adequate modelling of the root zone despite the lack of information on the latter as for the reduced modelling performance in the bottom soil layer the fact that observations represent a point measurement at a specific depth while modelled values represent mean soil water content for a 60 cm deep layer 20 cm for us wkg could explain discrepancies between observed and modelled values moreover disagreement between observed and modelled values at the bottom layer could also be associated with the challenge of capturing changes in soil properties with depth indeed we used soil texture information sampled at a single depth to define soil hydraulic properties although the texture is known to change throughout the soil profile still a previous study by alavi et al 2016 found that depth varying soil texture only had a small influence on the performance of soil moisture modelling near the surface for the hgs simulation at us mrf we parametrized the transpiration reduction function as a linear function eq 7 rather than as a step function eq 6 as was the case for all other simulations we opted for this linear parameterization given a step function led to a large underestimation of soil moisture with hgs and the more gradual onset of water stress as represented by the linear function appeared better suited little guidance is generally offered in the literature regarding the definition of water stress points e g wilting point field capacity and the shape of transpiration reduction functions under forested as opposed to agricultural settings although the formulation of these functions can have a substantial impact on water budget simulations ferguson et al 2016 for example field capacity is often used to define the upper limit of water stress conditions in models although there is little empirical evidence that this hydrological variable which describes drainage conditions can be readily associated with water stress conditions for vegetation moreover the shape of transpiration reduction functions is often hard coded in models leaving little flexibility for adjustment however vegetation can exhibit considerable variability in terms of transpiration reduction functions for example isohydric behavior in plants is associated with early stomatal closure in response to water stress which would typically translate into steep transpiration reduction functions on the other hand anisohydric behavior means plants tend to maintain stomata open thus leading to a more gradual decrease in transpiration reduction functions verhoef and egea 2014 overall more work is needed to improve the definition of transpiration reduction functions and the proposed framework i e using observed evapotranspiration as forcing data could help find answers 5 4 sources of uncertainty in simulating soil moisture using evapotranspiration observations as a forcing we were able to reduce uncertainty associated with the simulation of this flux for the most part the uncertainty associated with eddy covariance measurements of course remains thus allowing to focus on subsurface processes and properties first we discuss sources of uncertainty in hydrosvs simulations that the comparison with hgs brought out second we discuss sources of uncertainty associated with both models both models hydrosvs and hgs describe unsaturated flow using richards equation ruling out this aspect as a source of divergence between them unlike many model comparison studies breuer and huisman 2009 smith et al 2012 vansteenkiste et al 2014 the present one did not seek to compare the use of conceptual reservoir scheme versus richards equation to represent flow in an unsaturated medium while both models use the same governing equation to describe unsaturated flow the representation is simplified in mainly two ways in hydrosvs flow is simulated in one dimension as opposed to a three dimensional simulation with hgs and the soil column is represented with a lower vertical resolution with compartments that vary in size between 5 and 60 cm in the top meter as opposed to a 1 cm vertical discretization in hgs our study was not designed to specifically assess gains in performance associated with a single versus multidimensional of flow representation but koch et al 2016 showed that a three dimensional representation of unsaturated flow did not improve soil moisture simulation over a small catchment as for vertical resolution hydrosvs is particularly sensitive to the vertical root profile since it largely determined from which soil zone water uptake took place as opposed to hgs simulations that used a very fine discretization of the soil column as discussed in section 5 2 hydrosvs performed relatively poorly at the semiarid site and the use of the van genuchten model which includes a term for residual soil moisture appeared like a more suited choice to describe the water retention curve under a semiarid climate overall hydrosvs had a slightly weaker but overall comparable performance to the more complex model hgs with the exception of the semiarid site other studies have shown that simple models can perform similarly or even better than complex ones when simulating soil moisture orth et al 2015 orth and seneviratne 2015 given their lower computational demand simple models represent useful tools to sample the entire parameter space with automatic calibration to model soil moisture when only poorly resolved input data are available or to perform forecasts over large domains on the other hand complex models include an explicit and detailed description of processes which can make them better equipped to simulate changing climate or land use conditions while we have identified here a few areas of improvement for hydrosvs it should be noted that only small gains in performance were achieved when simulating soil moisture with hgs at sites with mediterranean and temperate climates this illustrates the limits of increasing model complexity and points towards other aspects such as parameter allocation i e assigning values to soil and vegetation properties to improve soil moisture simulation in this study automatic parameter calibration was not used and instead we relied on observations at the ameriflux sites values taken from the literature and pedo transfer functions ptfs to set soil and vegetation properties different ptfs were used to set soil hydraulic parameters clapp and hornberger for hydrosvs and rosetta for hgs the choice of ptfs can introduce considerable uncertainty and baroni et al 2010 found that ptfs introduced greater uncertainty in soil moisture simulations than the choice of a conceptual versus physically based hydrological model still no distinct superiority emerges in the literature among ptfs to reduce uncertainty associated with the estimation of soil hydraulic parameters we used soil water content observations to set porosity or adjust residual saturation parameters this tailoring improved model performance but given the paucity of information on soil and vegetation properties the description of other properties had to be simplified when setting soil hydraulic parameters we assigned homogeneous properties over the modelling domain except for hydraulic conductivity which varied with depth in hydrosvs simulations see section 3 3 even though soil properties generally vary with depth and the inclusion of this information has been shown to improve simulations decharme et al 2006 apart from soil hydraulic properties there is considerable uncertainty regarding the definition of stress points wilting point and field capacity in transpiration reduction functions such stress points are generally set using fixed thresholds in soil water potential 1 5 mpa and 0 033 mpa in this study however these soil water potential thresholds have been shown to vary between vegetation types emanuel et al 2007 miller et al 2007 for example wilting can be initiated at a lower threshold of water availability for vegetation in semiarid climates 2 to 4 mpa baldocchi et al 2004 and as such the wilting point at the semiarid site us wkg may have been overestimated especially in the hydrosvs simulation wilting point 0 19 m3 m 3 table 3 moreover field capacity water potential 0 033 mpa has largely been used to define the onset of water stress in vegetation although research indicates that the use of this proxy may not always be appropriate miller et al 2007 the vertical root profile also proves challenging to describe and as in hgs only the maximum rooting depth is often taken into consideration in hydrological and land surface models while an additional parameter describes the shape of the root profile in hydrosvs c in eq 5 rarely are the data available to set it in an informed way this is a good example where model capacity appears to have surpassed our ability to allocate values to parameters as it often appears to be the case for subsurface properties 5 5 limitations this project used one dimensional column simulations to assess the ability of models to simulate soil moisture this simplified representation which assumes vertical flow only appeared reasonable given the study sites were located on relatively flat terrain as are most sites of the ameriflux network lateral flow was not taken into consideration in this study although it can play an important role particularly over sloped terrain the representation of lateral flow processes has been identified as an area for improvement in land surface models davison et al 2016 and hydrosvs proposes an improved parameterization of this hydrological process alavi et al 2016 further work is needed to assess the representation of this process in hydrosvs in this study model fidelity was assessed by comparing observed and modelled values of volumetric soil water content however soil moisture exhibits substantial spatiotemporal variability for example the coefficient of variation of soil moisture measurements can range between 10 and 50 over a 100 m scale famiglietti et al 2008 gwak and kim 2017 hang et al 2016 measurements at a single location as it is the case here cannot capture this horizontal variability in soil moisture additionally uncertainty is also associated with the vertical positioning of soil moisture probes indeed a precise definition of the surface can be difficult in the presence of rocks and litter and will affect our ability to compare observed and modelled values at a given depth it should also be noted that observations are performed at a single depth while modelled values correspond to the average soil moisture over a certain soil depth that ranged between 5 and 60 cm when using evapotranspiration observations as forcing data a divergence may occur between the observed and simulated flux if soil moisture in the root zone falls below the wilting point as described in section 3 1 in this case hydrosvs was set up to tap water from deeper soil layers to fulfill the observed evapotranspiration flux in hydrosvs simulations soil moisture in the root zone did not go below the wilting point at the mediterranean and temperate sites and as such we did not encounter this issue at the semiarid site soil moisture in the top layers fell below the wilting point but modelled evapotranspiration was still able to match the forcing data by taping water from lower soil compartments within the root zone still a mismatch between the observed and simulated evapotranspiration flux is a limitation of the proposed approach that should be kept in mind and this disparity could be due to a misdefinition of either the wilting point or the root zone depth last this study focused exclusively on warm season hydrological processes and we selected only snow free sites the ability of the model to represent soil freeze thaw processes which have a considerable influence on soil moisture in colder climates was not explored to better account for these processes a new snow module isba es is currently being implemented into svs which currently relies on a simple force restore approach 6 conclusions this study used flux tower observations of evapotranspiration as forcing data to assess the ability of hydrosvs the hydrological module of the svs land surface model to simulate soil moisture under snow free conditions by decoupling two aspects of evapotranspiration i e its magnitude and its sourcing this approach provides a powerful diagnostic tool regarding the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in land surface models in this study we compared the performance of hydrosvs to soil moisture simulations performed with hgs a state of the art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model thus providing important context relative to the trade off between model fidelity and complexity overall hydrosvs provided a realistic simulation of soil moisture under mediterranean and temperature climates sites us ton us mrf us wbw and as illustrated by hgs simulations increased model complexity yielded only minor improvements in terms of soil moisture modelling as such this study provides a strong argument regarding the potential of svs for hydrological applications under a semiarid climate site us wkg soil moisture modelling proved challenging for hydrosvs the successful simulation of soil moisture with hgs suggests that certain features such as the inclusion of residual saturation when defining water retention curves can be

7467,to address certain limitations with their current operational model environment and climate change canada recently developed the soil vegetation and snow svs land surface model and the representation of subsurface hydrological processes was targeted as an area for improvement the objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of hydrosvs the component of svs responsible for the vertical redistribution of water to simulate soil moisture under snow free conditions when using flux tower observations of evapotranspiration as forcing data we assessed 1 model fidelity by comparing soil moisture modelled with hydrosvs to point scale measurements of volumetric soil water content and 2 model complexity by comparing the performance of hydrosvs to that of hydrogeosphere a state of the art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model to do this we performed one dimensional soil column simulations at four sites of the ameriflux network results indicate that under mediterranean and temperate climates hydrosvs satisfactorily simulated soil moisture nash sutcliffe efficiency between 0 26 and 0 70 r2 0 80 with a performance comparable to hydrogeosphere nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 60 r2 0 80 however hydrosvs performed weakly under a semiarid climate while hydrogeosphere performed relatively well by decoupling the magnitude and sourcing of evapotranspiration this study proposes a powerful diagnostic tool to evaluate the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in land surface models overall this study highlights the potential of svs for hydrological applications keywords soil moisture land surface model svs hydrogeosphere 1 introduction land surface models describe the interactions between the atmosphere and the land surface by simulating exchanges of momentum heat and water within the earth system land surface models provide the bottom boundary conditions for atmospheric models and are a key element of numerical weather prediction systems and climate change projection modelling the ability of land surface models to capture hydrological processes is crucial to represent land atmosphere coupling clark et al 2015a maxwell et al 2007 subsurface hydrological processes are particularly important for modelling land atmosphere interactions because soil moisture plays a key role in modulating fluxes and stores of water and energy indeed soil moisture reflects precipitation storage constrains evapotranspiration under water limiting conditions and influences the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and runoff seneviratne et al 2010 despite their importance for land atmosphere coupling subsurface hydrological processes have typically been represented in a simplified form in many land surface models clark et al 2015a davison et al 2016 in particular operational land surface models geared towards weather forecasting tend to simplify the representation of hydrological processes to minimize computational costs environment and climate change canada currently uses a modified version of the interactions between soil biosphere and atmosphere isba land surface model to produce operational weather forecasts accordingly the isba model provides surface fluxes of momentum water and energy to the global environmental multiscale gem atmospheric model in isba soil moisture is modelled using a force restore approach involving only two soil layers extending to the assumed root depth bélair et al 2003 to address certain limitations with isba environment and climate change canada developed the soil vegetation and snow svs land surface model with the representation of subsurface hydrological processes targeted as an area for improvement in the hydrological module of svs hydrosvs the soil column is now represented with increased vertical resolution and the vertical movement of water through the soil is now described using a finite difference solution of richards equation for unsaturated flow alavi et al 2016 two studies recently compared the performance of svs and isba in offline mode and found that modifications implemented in svs improved the simulation of soil moisture and brightness temperature during the warm season over the north american domain alavi et al 2016 husain et al 2016 with these improvements svs coupled with a routing scheme now offers a computationally efficient tool for hydrological prediction for example svs coupled to the watroute routing scheme yielded a runoff simulation performance similar to two widely used distributed hydrological models mesh and watflood for the lake ontario watershed gaborit et al 2017 moreover land surface models also offer a tool for hydrologists to better integrate land atmosphere interactions in hydrological modelling see for instance maxwell et al 2007 soulis et al 2000 zabel and mauser 2013 various model evaluation and comparison initiatives have been undertaken in the land surface modelling community and have fuelled their rapid evolution henderson sellers et al 1995 1993 van den hurk et al 2011 while two studies have recently evaluated the global performance of svs at the continental scale alavi et al 2016 husain et al 2016 relevant diagnostics that can pinpoint problematic parameterization of processes are also needed for example point scale assessments are essential to answer questions regarding the ability of a model to capture the temporal and spatial variability of certain variables such as soil moisture an efficient evaluation of model fidelity in reproducing observations often relies on the isolation of individual processes clark et al 2015b as such in the present study subsurface hydrological processes infiltration percolation vegetation water uptake are specifically targeted while most studies generally focus on evaluating model fidelity e g the ability of the model to reproduce observations a joint evaluation of model fidelity and complexity facilitates a clear assessment of trade offs between different modelling options for instance potential performance gains associated with increased complexity can be evaluated in light of their added computational cost building upon previous evaluations of svs at a continental scale the objective of the present study is to evaluate the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in hydrosvs this study focuses on the performance of hydrosvs at the point scale over a multiyear horizon to do so we follow an evaluation framework that 1 isolates subsurface hydrological processes by targeting study sites that are part of the ameriflux network where measured surface fluxes such as evapotranspiration can be used as forcing data 2 evaluates model fidelity by comparing soil moisture modelled with hydrosvs to point scale measurements at various depths and 3 assesses model complexity by comparing the soil moisture modelling performance of hydrosvs to hydrogeosphere a state of the art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model 2 study area 2 1 description of ameriflux sites we selected four study sites from the ameriflux network baldocchi et al 2001 where surface fluxes were measured using the eddy covariance method fig 1 ameriflux sites are all subject to a series of data harmonization and quality control measures that facilitate site intercomparison the following criteria were used for site selection 1 volumetric soil water content measurements available at multiple depths and for multiple years 2 absence of snow cover to specifically target warm season subsurface hydrological processes and 3 representation of contrasting climates and vegetation types table 1 describes the four study sites and their associated climates semiarid mediterranean temperate and vegetation types grassland woody savanna deciduous broadleaf forest evergreen needleleaf forest in terms of climate and seasonality a semiarid climate prevails at us wkg and 60 of the annual precipitation occurs during the north american monsoon in july august and september moran et al 2009a scott et al 2010 the us ton site is characterized by a mediterranean climate and precipitation largely occurs during the winter months october to may with very little rainfall during the summer the us mrf site also has a mediterranean climate with a relatively dry summer but precipitation during the wet winter months is about three times greater than at us ton the us wbw site has a temperate climate with a year round supply of precipitation precipitation and water vapor flux data at a 30 min time step were extracted from the ameriflux database http ameriflux lbl gov baldocchi et al 2001 soil moisture data were extracted from the cdiac hosted database carbon dioxide information analysis center http cdiac esd ornl gov programs ameriflux data system aamer html given that observations were available at multiple depths unlike the typical two measurement levels found in the ameriflux database across the study sites soil moisture was measured with a variety of probes that generally derive volumetric soil water content by measuring an electrical property of the soil more specifically theta ml2 x probes delta t devices were deployed at us ton and us wbw miller et al 2007 stevens water hydra probe sensors at us wkg keefer et al 2008 and campbell scientific cs615 probes at us mrf kwon et al 2017 measurement accuracy typically ranges between 0 01 and 0 05 m3 m 3 for the sensors used 3 methodology 3 1 description of the svs model a detailed description of hydrosvs the hydrology scheme of svs can be found in alavi et al 2016 in hydrosvs the vertical movement of water is described by the one dimensional richards equation for unsaturated flow in a porous medium soulis et al 2000 the evolution of moisture in soil layers is described using the conservation equation 1 θ t f z s where θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 f is the water flux kg m 2 s 1 and s is the sink source term kg m 2 s 1 that includes precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff lateral flow base flow at the bottom of the soil layer as well as snow runoff melting and freezing the water flux f z t at depth z and time t is described by darcy s law 2 f z t k v z t ψ z 1 where k v z t is the vertical hydraulic conductivity m s 1 and ψ z t is the soil water potential m in hydrosvs eq 1 is solved numerically using a fourth order runge kutta finite difference method the soil column is discretized into soil layers whose depth and exact number can be defined by the user and the water flux between each layer can be computed with darcy s law the relationship between soil water content soil water potential and relative permeability follows the clapp and hornberger 1978 model among sink and source terms the evaporation and transpiration fluxes are typically derived from the svs simulation of the energy budget using a force restore approach husain et al 2016 accordingly each grid cell is divided into the three surface types found in the model bare ground low vegetation and high vegetation and a distinct energy budget is computed for each surface type instead in this study we used the eddy covariance measured water vapor flux as a forcing to the model see section 3 4 for a description of the boundary conditions with the exception of the semiarid site us wkg we assumed a land cover consisting exclusively of high vegetation in the absence of information on evapotranspiration partitioning into evaporation soil and wet canopy and transpiration we assumed that at these sites us ton us mrf us wbw the surface water vapor flux occurred exclusively through transpiration as such soil evaporation and interception were considered negligible at the semiarid site us wkg where vegetation is sparse and transpiration accounts for 79 of evapotranspiration during the monsoon period moran et al 2009b we assumed land cover was made up of bare soil at 25 and low vegetation at 75 accordingly bare soil evaporation i e 25 of the observed evapotranspiration used as forcing was removed from the top soil layer and the remaining flux occurred through transpiration as it is the case for the three other sites at all sites water uptake from transpiration was distributed over the soil column as a function of the root profile and transpiration reduction function 3 t z et obs r z f θ where t z is the evapotranspiration rate kg m 2 s 1 at depth z m et obs is observed evapotranspiration kg m 2 s 1 as measured at the flux tower r z is the root distribution function and f θ is the transpiration reduction function the proportion of roots in a soil layer n corresponds to 4 r z r z n r z n 1 where r z n is the fraction of roots above the soil layer depth z n m and is described using the equation proposed by schenk and jackson 2003 5 r z n 1 1 z n z 50 c where z 50 is the depth m above which 50 of roots are found and c is a shape parameter z 50 was set to about 40 of the maximum root depth 0 5 m at us wkg 0 3 m at us ton 1 m at us mrf 0 25 at us wbw the shape parameter c was derived from z 50 and the maximum root depth see husain et al 2016 the transpiration reduction function was parameterized as a step function given that observed rather than potential evapotranspiration was provided as a forcing 6 f θ 0 for θ θ wp 1 for θ θ wp where θ wp is the volumetric soil water content at wilting point m3 m 3 accordingly if soil moisture fell below the wilting point evapotranspiration was stopped for that soil layer and we assumed that the evapotranspiration that could not be fulfilled i e the difference between the forcing data and the modelled evapotranspiration would be supplied by water from deeper layers i e at depths greater than the maximum rooting depth this assumption appeared reasonable given the uncertainty in describing the maximum rooting depth i e using information from the literature for a single species as well as evidence that trees can tap water from deep soil layers or even groundwater miller et al 2010 thompson et al 2011 3 2 description of the hydrogeosphere model as a state of the art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model hydrogeosphere hgs offers a benchmark against which to compare hydrosvs hgs is an integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model that simultaneously solves for two dimensional overland flow and three dimensional variably saturated flow aquanty 2013 overland surface flow is simulated with the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equations and subsurface variably saturated flow is simulated with a modified form of richards equation the equations are discretized with the control volume finite element mode forsyth 1991 the surface and subsurface domains are coupled with the dual node approach which uses a first order exchange coefficient between the domains the relationship between soil water content soil water potential and relative permeability is described using the van genuchten 1980 model a detailed description of equations and their numerical implementation is found in aquanty 2013 previous studies have successfully used hgs to simulate soil moisture and the model showed an excellent ability to capture spatio temporal dynamics in a small catchment koch et al 2016 moreover the model was part of an initiative for surface subsurface model intercomparison and it successfully simulated soil saturation in a benchmark test case maxwell et al 2014 in hgs the kristensen and jensen 1975 model is implemented to simulate transpiration and evaporation as a function of potential evapotranspiration and water availability at each node within the root and evaporation zones however in this study eddy covariance measurements of evapotranspiration were used as an input to the model see section 3 4 for a description of the boundary conditions similar to the hydrosvs simulations we assumed that soil evaporation and interception were negligible and that only transpiration occurred as described in eq 3 in hgs the root distribution function r z followed a cubic law between the surface and the maximum root depth since the actual relationship at each site is unknown the transpiration reduction function f θ was parametrized either as a step function eq 6 or as a linear function according to 7 f θ 0 for θ θ wp θ θ wp θ fc θ wp for θ wp θ θ fc 1 for θ θ fc where θ fc is the volumetric soil water content at field capacity m3 m 3 according to eq 7 if soil moisture falls below field capacity transpiration is reduced and modelled evapotranspiration is thus smaller than the observed evapotranspiration used as forcing data moreover only soil water over the root zone is available for transpiration and the hgs model cannot tap deep soil layers to feed the transpiration flux 3 3 model setup hydrosvs and hgs were both set up to perform one dimensional soil column simulations fig 2 we chose to discretize the soil differently in order to reflect how each model is typically set up for operational applications in hydrosvs the soil column was 3 meter deep and divided into seven soil layers at depths of 5 10 20 40 100 200 and 300 cm in hgs the soil column was 1 meter deep and the vertical grid resolution was set to 1 cm throughout the entire column since all soil moisture measurements were performed in the first meter from the surface we constrained the hgs simulations to a one meter soil column to minimize simulation times about one hour with hgs compared to a few seconds for hydrosvs table 2 lists soil and vegetation properties shared by the two models although soil properties are known to vary with depth we assigned uniform properties for soil texture throughout the soil column since information at multiple depths was not available soil texture information was taken from the literature or metadata from the ameriflux database soil porosity was set as the maximum soil water content observed nearest to the surface at each site root depth was determined from data in the literature site specific information on root distribution was used at us wbw wilson et al 2001 while a site specific optimized maximum root depth from ichii et al 2009 was used for us ton for the two other sites maximum root depth was estimated based on the maximum root depth of the dominant species at the site as found in the literature douglas fir at us mrf in mcminn 1963 and lehmann lovegrass at us wkg in gibbens and lenz 2001 table 3 identifies key differences between soil hydraulic properties used by the two models both models used the same soil texture as input data table 2 but differences arise since we chose to use the expressions currently implemented hydrosvs or most commonly used hgs for each model to translate texture into hydraulic properties in hydrosvs saturated hydraulic conductivity is computed from the soil s sand content using the expression derived by brooks and corey 1966 hydraulic conductivity is assumed to exponentially decay with depth in hydrosvs alavi et al 2016 while we set it up as constant in hgs simulations for hgs simulations we derived saturated hydraulic conductivity and residual saturation using soil texture as an input to the rosetta model schaap et al 2002 however when the observed minimum soil water content was inferior to the rosetta computed residual saturation as was the case for two sites us wkg and us ton residual saturation was set according to the observed minimum soil water content in hydrosvs the wilting point is calculated based on the clay content of the soil table 2 using empirical equations in boone et al 1999 and the field capacity is obtained using the parameterization described by soulis et al 2011 this method assumes that field capacity is reached through drainage of an initially saturated soil until a vertical gradient of soil moisture is established such that water potential balances out gravity in hgs we defined the wilting point and field capacity as the soil water content corresponding to 1 5 and 0 033 mpa respectively based on the water retention curve models also differed in the expression of the water retention curve and relative permeability for both models soil texture information table 2 was used to derive parameters describing these relationships but different models were used clapp and hornberger model in hydrosvs and van genuchten model in hgs see sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 4 initial and boundary conditions we defined initial subsurface conditions with soil water content measurements taken at three or more depths depending on data availability at each site we used linear interpolation between soil moisture observations to assign initial conditions for the rest of the soil column for initial surface conditions we assumed a surface water depth of zero simulations were performed for a five year period with the exception of us wbw where data were only available for 2 5 years precipitation and gap filled evapotranspiration observations at a 30 min time step were used as boundary conditions for the two models indeed we bypassed the internal computation of evapotranspiration within models and we rather used eddy covariance measurements of evapotranspiration as forcing data gap filling of evapotranspiration was either performed with the reddyproc web tool reichstein et al 2005 us wkg us mrf us wbw or gap filled data were already available from the cdiac database us ton in hydrosvs water exited the model domain as surface runoff when either surface soil moisture exceeds saturation or when the precipitation rate exceeds saturated hydraulic conductivity at the surface hence infiltration capacity outflow at the bottom of the soil column occurred when soil water content exceeded field capacity and was computed with the expression developed by soulis et al 2011 eq 12 in hgs we applied a critical depth boundary at the surface to allow overland flow to exit the model domain and we applied a unit vertical hydraulic gradient at the bottom of the soil column to allow free drainage 3 5 modelling performance we evaluated the adequacy between observed and simulated values of soil water content with a series of metrics we computed the root mean square error rmse which assesses the variance of the model error we computed the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for which the optimal value is 1 and a value inferior to 0 indicates that the mean observed soil water content offers a better predictor than the model we computed the coefficient of determination r2 which is the squared value of the pearson coefficient of correlation this metric assesses the proportion of the total variance in observations that is explained by the model we computed the percent bias pbias which measures the average tendency of simulated soil water content to be larger or smaller than observations the optimal value is 0 and a positive negative value indicates an overestimation underestimation bias 4 results metrics describing the agreement between observed and modelled soil water content are presented in table 4 these metrics are presented for the middle soil layers which correspond to measurement depths of 15 20 30 and 20 cm at us wkg us ton us mrf and us wbw respectively it should be noted that these metrics were computed by comparing soil water content measurements at a single depth to modelled values corresponding to the average soil moisture over a certain soil depth depth 10 cm at us wkg and 20 cm at other sites 4 1 soil moisture modelling under a semiarid climate us wkg at the us wkg site the mean annual precipitation was 324 mm during the study period with 2013 being the driest year 264 mm and 2014 the wettest year 415 mm fig 3 a during the study period 2010 2014 2010 experienced an unusually wet winter with 110 mm in the first five months of the year compared to an average of 36 mm for the other years the performance of hydrosvs was weak at the semiarid site as illustrated by the negative value of the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse 2 69 table 4 during the dry season january to june soil moisture was completely depleted near the surface 0 5 cm in the hydrosvs simulations fig 3b while a minimum of 0 02 m3 m 3 was observed during dry periods hydrosvs simulated a soil water content of 0 m3 m 3 in four out of five years on the other hand the hgs simulation was able to capture the residual water content during dry periods and soil water content did not go below 0 05 m3 m 3 near the surface for deeper soil layers 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm fig 3c d soil moisture was generally overestimated in hydrosvs simulations with a mean value of 0 21 m3 m 3 at 10 20 cm over the five year period in comparison to a mean observed soil water content of 0 10 m3 m 3 at 15 cm for the same period excluding the 2010 217 to 2011 365 period given the gap in observations indeed the percent bias for the mid layer was 53 table 4 the only exception to this overestimation was the post 2010 monsoon period when simulated soil water content fell to 0 m3 m 3 in the 10 20 cm layer although observed soil water content never went below 0 1 m3 m 3 at a 15 cm depth the hgs model fared much better than hydrosvs at the deeper soil layers 10 20 cm and 20 40 cm fig 3c d hgs simulations of soil moisture captured the observed variability in soil moisture at the middle soil layer r2 0 56 table 4 but reduced performance was observed at the bottom soil layer r2 0 40 for example soil water content at 30 cm varied little during the 2013 monsoon period which did not match the hgs simulated increase in soil water content at the bottom layer 20 40 cm fig 3d 4 2 soil moisture modelling under a hot summer mediterranean climate us ton at us ton precipitation events were concentrated during winter months from october to may winter precipitation ranged between 511 and 557 mm during the study period with the exception of the wet winter of 2010 2011 when precipitation reached 814 mm fig 4 a hydrosvs overestimated soil moisture at all soil layers pbias 41 15 and 30 at the top middle and bottom soil layers although the model performed particularly well at the middle soil layer fig 4c nse 0 70 table 4 at the surface layer both models generally failed to predict soil water content above 0 45 m3 m 3 while the observed maximum soil water content reached 0 56 m3 m 3 fig 4b during dry months june to september hydrosvs largely overestimated soil moisture in the surface layer the minimum simulated soil water content was 0 16 m3 m 3 in the 0 5 cm layer while the observed minimum fell to 0 04 m3 m 3 at the surface fig 4b as a result of this overestimation soil moisture in the hydrosvs simulation never went below the wilting point 0 12 m3 m 3 table 3 in the bottom soil layer both models generally overestimated soil water content the minimum observed value at a 50 cm depth was 0 13 m3 m 3 while the minimum value modelled with hydrosvs was 0 20 m3 m 3 and 0 17 m3 m 3 with hgs for the zone at depths between 40 and 100 cm fig 4d 4 3 soil moisture modelling under a warm summer mediterranean climate us mrf the mean annual precipitation recorded at us mrf ranged between 964 in 2011 and 1337 in 2007 mm which was considerably lower than the long term annual average of 1820 mm fig 5 a the seasonal pattern was adequately captured by the two models and both hydrosvs and hgs were able to simulate the soil moisture decline during spring and summer months when vegetation was active in the middle and bottom soil layers soil moisture simulated with hydrosvs closely agreed with observations fig 5c d however similar to us ton soil moisture in the surface layer was overestimated by hydrosvs during drier months june to september the observed soil water content reached a minimum of 0 17 m3 m 3 at a depth of 10 cm while the simulated minimum was 0 24 m3 m 3 for the soil layer comprised between 10 and 20 cm accordingly soil moisture simulated with hydrosvs never fell below the wilting point 0 17 m3 m 3 table 3 following the rainy season october to may hgs adequately captured the soil moisture decline in the surface layer fig 5b but generally underestimated soil moisture during spring and summer months in the middle and bottom soil layers fig 5c d for example soil water content modelled with hgs at 20 40 cm dropped to 0 16 m3 m 3 while the observed minimum at a depth of 30 cm remained at 0 21 m3 m 3 both models also tended to underestimate peak soil moisture during the rainy season october to may and often failed to simulate soil water content above 0 40 m3 m 3 in the middle and bottom layers fig 5c d pbias 3 and 8 for hydrosvs and hgs table 4 towards the end of the study period second half of 2011 soil moisture appeared largely underestimated by the two models in the bottom soil layer fig 5d although we suspect that the sudden jump in soil moisture observations may be sensor related 4 4 soil moisture modelling under a temperate climate us wbw data were only available for 2 5 years at us wbw and the study period was characterized by a wet year in 2004 with 1600 mm of precipitation and a relatively dry year in 2005 with only 995 mm of precipitation fig 6 a both models satisfactorily captured the seasonal soil moisture pattern at us wbw characterized by maximum soil moisture during winter months and a decrease during spring and summer months when increased vegetation activity occurred fig 6 hydrosvs had difficulties capturing minimum soil moisture in the top and middle soil layers during the summer pbias 8 and 23 at the top and middle layers for example in the fall 2005 observed soil water content dropped to 0 05 m3 m 3 at a 5 cm depth while the minimum soil water content simulated by hydrosvs and hgs was respectively 0 16 m3 m 3 and 0 07 m3 m 3 in the top soil layer 0 5 cm fig 6a accordingly soil moisture never fell below the wilting point in the hydrosvs simulation θ wp 0 13 m 3 m 3 table 3 while it dropped slightly below the wilting point in the hgs simulation θ wp 0 07 m 3 m 3 table 3 unlike hydrosvs which adequately captured high soil water content values during the winter hgs generally underestimated soil water content in the middle soil layer during this period indeed observed soil water content generally remained above 0 25 m3 m 3 at 20 cm during the winter while hgs simulated soil water content hovered around 0 22 m3 m 3 for the soil layer ranging between 20 and 40 cm fig 6c still the two models were able to capture the short lived peaks in soil moisture during winter months at the bottom soil layer 40 100 cm fig 6 both models underestimated soil water content throughout the entire study period pbias 16 and 27 for hydrosvs and hgs for example while observed soil water content remained around 0 34 m3 m 3 during winter months simulated soil water content was generally below 0 30 m3 m 3 and 0 25 m3 m 3 for hydrosvs and hgs respectively however this underestimation could be due to a change in porosity at lower depths given that observed soil water content plateaued at lower values in surface layers 0 28 m3 m 3 at z 5 cm and 0 26 m3 m 3 at z 20 cm 5 discussion 5 1 tapping into flux tower networks to assess subsurface hydrological processes the ameriflux sites have largely been used to evaluate the representation of surface processes such as evapotranspiration in land surface models williams et al 2009 however the network also offers a great opportunity to isolate and evaluate subsurface processes evapotranspiration introduces considerable uncertainty in hydrological modelling seiller and anctil 2016 and numerous efforts have been dedicated to improve its simulation courault et al 2005 salvucci and gentine 2013 wang and bras 2011 the approach used in the present study provides new insight by decoupling two aspects of the evapotranspiration flux its magnitude and its sourcing indeed by providing data on the evapotranspiration magnitude the ameriflux dataset allowed us to focus on the sourcing portion of this flux while flux tower networks offer insight into the magnitude of water vapor fluxes eddy covariance measurements also tend to underestimate available energy with a mean imbalance of about 20 on an annual time scale stoy et al 2013 wilson et al 2002 the energy imbalance problem is particularly acute with data at a half hourly time scale i e input data used in the present study and generally attenuates over a daily time scale leuning et al 2012 this energy imbalance may translate into an underestimation of evapotranspiration foken 2008 which could lead to an overestimation of soil moisture when using the observed evapotranspiration as forcing data in the present study no distinct pattern of under or overestimation emerged in simulations during periods of maximum evapotranspiration we observed an overestimation of soil moisture in the middle soil layer in hydrosvs simulations pbias between 15 and 53 except for 3 at us mrf table 4 while hgs generally performed well during these periods pbias between 8 and 10 table 4 thus suggesting that the input data were not responsible a larger sample size would be necessary to assess if the energy imbalance of eddy covariance measurements translates into a systematic bias in soil moisture modelling using observed evapotranspiration as forcing data an underestimation of evapotranspiration by eddy covariance measurements could also be potentially compensated by the wind induced undercatch of precipitation by rain gauges sevruk 1982 moreover a spatial mismatch can also arise between the location of soil moisture measurements and the footprint of flux tower observations of evapotranspiration indeed evapotranspiration measurements are representative of the region upwind of the flux tower typically within a distance of approximately 100 times the tower height and water availability could differ from soil moisture measurements at the foot of the flux tower such mismatch could translate into differences between observed evapotranspiration which is used as forcing data and evapotranspiration actually taking place at the soil column where moisture measurements are being performed 5 2 soil moisture modelling under a semiarid climate soil moisture modelling under a semiarid climate proved challenging for hydrosvs which resulted in a negative nash sutcliffe coefficient table 4 in the hydrosvs simulation soil moisture was underestimated and sometimes completely depleted near the surface during dry months while it was overestimated in deeper soil layers us wkg fig 3 given the ability of hgs to properly simulate soil moisture at this site the input data soil texture used to derive hydraulic soil properties do not appear to be a reasonable explanation of the relatively poor performance of hydrosvs in fact our ability to rule out this issue and raise questions about the model itself stems from our evaluation approach that not only relies on observations but also considers the comparison with another model reduced performance for hydrosvs could be in part explained by differences in water retention curve used by the two models indeed the hgs model relied on the van genuchten model to describe the water retention curve and this model involved an additional parameter residual saturation which is not part of the clapp and hornberger 1978 model implemented in hydrosvs soil moisture can thus become completely depleted in hydrosvs simulations largely as a result of drainage since evapotranspiration will stop when soil moisture goes below the wilting point instead minimum soil water content could not go below residual saturation in hgs simulations which could explain its enhanced performance during rain free periods it should also be noted that residual saturation defined in hgs simulations were adjusted based on soil moisture observations at us wkg which was not the case in hydrosvs simulations indeed residual saturation derived using soil texture data as input the rosetta model was 0 07 m3 m 3 and instead we set residual saturation to 0 02 m3 m 3 in the hgs simulation in order to match the observed minimum soil moisture when soil moisture observations are lacking to make such adjustments a correction to water retention curves could also be applied to avoid overestimation of residual soil moisture under arid climates ciocca et al 2014 5 3 soil moisture modelling under mediterranean and temperate climates under mediterranean and temperate climates hydrosvs provided realistic soil moisture time series when observed precipitation and evapotranspiration were used as inputs in general hydrosvs had a performance comparable to that of the integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model hgs model in fact increased complexity did not yield better results and hydrosvs even outperformed hgs at us mrf nse 0 70 with hydrosvs compared to nse 0 60 with hgs table 4 as such the vertical resolution in the soil column in hydrosvs appeared sufficient to capture soil moisture variability under mediterranean and temperate climates moreover simulation times for a five year period were in the order of seconds for hydrosvs in comparison to approximately one hour with hgs overall hydrosvs satisfactorily captured the time evolution of soil moisture following precipitation events and the model was able to reproduce maximum soil moisture conditions given the importance associated with the estimation of peak flows in hydrology this behavior appears particularly relevant when assessing the potential of hydrosvs for hydrological prediction gaborit et al 2017 demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the gem hydro platform where svs is combined with the watroute routing scheme for streamflow prediction in tributaries of lake ontario north america these results in terms of soil moisture and streamflow modelling are promising relative to the use of land surface models in hydrology the performance of both models hydrosvs and hgs was generally best for the middle soil layer at depths between 20 and 40 cm while the weakest performance was generally found for the bottom soil layer figs 4 6 the good agreement between observed and modelled values in the middle layers suggests adequate modelling of the root zone despite the lack of information on the latter as for the reduced modelling performance in the bottom soil layer the fact that observations represent a point measurement at a specific depth while modelled values represent mean soil water content for a 60 cm deep layer 20 cm for us wkg could explain discrepancies between observed and modelled values moreover disagreement between observed and modelled values at the bottom layer could also be associated with the challenge of capturing changes in soil properties with depth indeed we used soil texture information sampled at a single depth to define soil hydraulic properties although the texture is known to change throughout the soil profile still a previous study by alavi et al 2016 found that depth varying soil texture only had a small influence on the performance of soil moisture modelling near the surface for the hgs simulation at us mrf we parametrized the transpiration reduction function as a linear function eq 7 rather than as a step function eq 6 as was the case for all other simulations we opted for this linear parameterization given a step function led to a large underestimation of soil moisture with hgs and the more gradual onset of water stress as represented by the linear function appeared better suited little guidance is generally offered in the literature regarding the definition of water stress points e g wilting point field capacity and the shape of transpiration reduction functions under forested as opposed to agricultural settings although the formulation of these functions can have a substantial impact on water budget simulations ferguson et al 2016 for example field capacity is often used to define the upper limit of water stress conditions in models although there is little empirical evidence that this hydrological variable which describes drainage conditions can be readily associated with water stress conditions for vegetation moreover the shape of transpiration reduction functions is often hard coded in models leaving little flexibility for adjustment however vegetation can exhibit considerable variability in terms of transpiration reduction functions for example isohydric behavior in plants is associated with early stomatal closure in response to water stress which would typically translate into steep transpiration reduction functions on the other hand anisohydric behavior means plants tend to maintain stomata open thus leading to a more gradual decrease in transpiration reduction functions verhoef and egea 2014 overall more work is needed to improve the definition of transpiration reduction functions and the proposed framework i e using observed evapotranspiration as forcing data could help find answers 5 4 sources of uncertainty in simulating soil moisture using evapotranspiration observations as a forcing we were able to reduce uncertainty associated with the simulation of this flux for the most part the uncertainty associated with eddy covariance measurements of course remains thus allowing to focus on subsurface processes and properties first we discuss sources of uncertainty in hydrosvs simulations that the comparison with hgs brought out second we discuss sources of uncertainty associated with both models both models hydrosvs and hgs describe unsaturated flow using richards equation ruling out this aspect as a source of divergence between them unlike many model comparison studies breuer and huisman 2009 smith et al 2012 vansteenkiste et al 2014 the present one did not seek to compare the use of conceptual reservoir scheme versus richards equation to represent flow in an unsaturated medium while both models use the same governing equation to describe unsaturated flow the representation is simplified in mainly two ways in hydrosvs flow is simulated in one dimension as opposed to a three dimensional simulation with hgs and the soil column is represented with a lower vertical resolution with compartments that vary in size between 5 and 60 cm in the top meter as opposed to a 1 cm vertical discretization in hgs our study was not designed to specifically assess gains in performance associated with a single versus multidimensional of flow representation but koch et al 2016 showed that a three dimensional representation of unsaturated flow did not improve soil moisture simulation over a small catchment as for vertical resolution hydrosvs is particularly sensitive to the vertical root profile since it largely determined from which soil zone water uptake took place as opposed to hgs simulations that used a very fine discretization of the soil column as discussed in section 5 2 hydrosvs performed relatively poorly at the semiarid site and the use of the van genuchten model which includes a term for residual soil moisture appeared like a more suited choice to describe the water retention curve under a semiarid climate overall hydrosvs had a slightly weaker but overall comparable performance to the more complex model hgs with the exception of the semiarid site other studies have shown that simple models can perform similarly or even better than complex ones when simulating soil moisture orth et al 2015 orth and seneviratne 2015 given their lower computational demand simple models represent useful tools to sample the entire parameter space with automatic calibration to model soil moisture when only poorly resolved input data are available or to perform forecasts over large domains on the other hand complex models include an explicit and detailed description of processes which can make them better equipped to simulate changing climate or land use conditions while we have identified here a few areas of improvement for hydrosvs it should be noted that only small gains in performance were achieved when simulating soil moisture with hgs at sites with mediterranean and temperate climates this illustrates the limits of increasing model complexity and points towards other aspects such as parameter allocation i e assigning values to soil and vegetation properties to improve soil moisture simulation in this study automatic parameter calibration was not used and instead we relied on observations at the ameriflux sites values taken from the literature and pedo transfer functions ptfs to set soil and vegetation properties different ptfs were used to set soil hydraulic parameters clapp and hornberger for hydrosvs and rosetta for hgs the choice of ptfs can introduce considerable uncertainty and baroni et al 2010 found that ptfs introduced greater uncertainty in soil moisture simulations than the choice of a conceptual versus physically based hydrological model still no distinct superiority emerges in the literature among ptfs to reduce uncertainty associated with the estimation of soil hydraulic parameters we used soil water content observations to set porosity or adjust residual saturation parameters this tailoring improved model performance but given the paucity of information on soil and vegetation properties the description of other properties had to be simplified when setting soil hydraulic parameters we assigned homogeneous properties over the modelling domain except for hydraulic conductivity which varied with depth in hydrosvs simulations see section 3 3 even though soil properties generally vary with depth and the inclusion of this information has been shown to improve simulations decharme et al 2006 apart from soil hydraulic properties there is considerable uncertainty regarding the definition of stress points wilting point and field capacity in transpiration reduction functions such stress points are generally set using fixed thresholds in soil water potential 1 5 mpa and 0 033 mpa in this study however these soil water potential thresholds have been shown to vary between vegetation types emanuel et al 2007 miller et al 2007 for example wilting can be initiated at a lower threshold of water availability for vegetation in semiarid climates 2 to 4 mpa baldocchi et al 2004 and as such the wilting point at the semiarid site us wkg may have been overestimated especially in the hydrosvs simulation wilting point 0 19 m3 m 3 table 3 moreover field capacity water potential 0 033 mpa has largely been used to define the onset of water stress in vegetation although research indicates that the use of this proxy may not always be appropriate miller et al 2007 the vertical root profile also proves challenging to describe and as in hgs only the maximum rooting depth is often taken into consideration in hydrological and land surface models while an additional parameter describes the shape of the root profile in hydrosvs c in eq 5 rarely are the data available to set it in an informed way this is a good example where model capacity appears to have surpassed our ability to allocate values to parameters as it often appears to be the case for subsurface properties 5 5 limitations this project used one dimensional column simulations to assess the ability of models to simulate soil moisture this simplified representation which assumes vertical flow only appeared reasonable given the study sites were located on relatively flat terrain as are most sites of the ameriflux network lateral flow was not taken into consideration in this study although it can play an important role particularly over sloped terrain the representation of lateral flow processes has been identified as an area for improvement in land surface models davison et al 2016 and hydrosvs proposes an improved parameterization of this hydrological process alavi et al 2016 further work is needed to assess the representation of this process in hydrosvs in this study model fidelity was assessed by comparing observed and modelled values of volumetric soil water content however soil moisture exhibits substantial spatiotemporal variability for example the coefficient of variation of soil moisture measurements can range between 10 and 50 over a 100 m scale famiglietti et al 2008 gwak and kim 2017 hang et al 2016 measurements at a single location as it is the case here cannot capture this horizontal variability in soil moisture additionally uncertainty is also associated with the vertical positioning of soil moisture probes indeed a precise definition of the surface can be difficult in the presence of rocks and litter and will affect our ability to compare observed and modelled values at a given depth it should also be noted that observations are performed at a single depth while modelled values correspond to the average soil moisture over a certain soil depth that ranged between 5 and 60 cm when using evapotranspiration observations as forcing data a divergence may occur between the observed and simulated flux if soil moisture in the root zone falls below the wilting point as described in section 3 1 in this case hydrosvs was set up to tap water from deeper soil layers to fulfill the observed evapotranspiration flux in hydrosvs simulations soil moisture in the root zone did not go below the wilting point at the mediterranean and temperate sites and as such we did not encounter this issue at the semiarid site soil moisture in the top layers fell below the wilting point but modelled evapotranspiration was still able to match the forcing data by taping water from lower soil compartments within the root zone still a mismatch between the observed and simulated evapotranspiration flux is a limitation of the proposed approach that should be kept in mind and this disparity could be due to a misdefinition of either the wilting point or the root zone depth last this study focused exclusively on warm season hydrological processes and we selected only snow free sites the ability of the model to represent soil freeze thaw processes which have a considerable influence on soil moisture in colder climates was not explored to better account for these processes a new snow module isba es is currently being implemented into svs which currently relies on a simple force restore approach 6 conclusions this study used flux tower observations of evapotranspiration as forcing data to assess the ability of hydrosvs the hydrological module of the svs land surface model to simulate soil moisture under snow free conditions by decoupling two aspects of evapotranspiration i e its magnitude and its sourcing this approach provides a powerful diagnostic tool regarding the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in land surface models in this study we compared the performance of hydrosvs to soil moisture simulations performed with hgs a state of the art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model thus providing important context relative to the trade off between model fidelity and complexity overall hydrosvs provided a realistic simulation of soil moisture under mediterranean and temperature climates sites us ton us mrf us wbw and as illustrated by hgs simulations increased model complexity yielded only minor improvements in terms of soil moisture modelling as such this study provides a strong argument regarding the potential of svs for hydrological applications under a semiarid climate site us wkg soil moisture modelling proved challenging for hydrosvs the successful simulation of soil moisture with hgs suggests that certain features such as the inclusion of residual saturation when defining water retention curves can be

7468,the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of a 30 m thick surficial clayey aquitard overlying a regional aquifer at an industrial site in the mississippi river valley in louisiana was investigated via intensive hydraulic characterization using high resolution vertical hydraulic head profiles with temporal monitoring and laboratory tests a study area was instrumented with a semi circular array of piezometers at many depths in the aquitard at equal distance from a large capacity pumping well including replicate piezometers profiles showed negligible head differential to 20 m bgs below which there was an abrupt change in vertical gradients over the lower 8 10 m of the aquitard hydraulic characteristics are strongly associated with depositional environment the upper zone of minimal head differentials with depth and minimal variation over time correlates with paleo mississippi river backswamp deposits while the lower zone with large head differentials and slow but moderate head changes correlates with lacustrine deposits the lower zone restricts groundwater flow between the surface and underlying regional aquifer which is hydraulically connected to the mississippi river lab tests on lacustrine samples show low kv 8 10 11 4 10 9 m s bracketing field estimates 6 10 10 m s from 1 d model fits to piezometric data in response to large aquifer head changes the slow response indicates absence of through going open fractures in the lacustrine unit consistent with geotechnical properties high plasticity normal consolidation suggesting high integrity that protects the underlying aquifer from surficial contamination the lack of vertical gradients in the overlying backswamp unit indicates abundant secondary permeability features e g fractures rootholes consistent with depositional and weathering conditions 2 d stylized transient flow simulations including both units supports this interpretation other published reports on surficial aquitards in the gulf coast region pertain to pleistocene deposits that lack laterally extensive lacustrine units and where kv is enhanced by secondary permeability features resulting in clayey aquitards with poor integrity keywords clayey aquitard integrity hydraulic conductivity storativity hydraulic diffusivity fractures 1 introduction many potable water aquifers are overlain by surficial clayey aquitards governing groundwater recharge and providing some degree of protection from near surface sources of contamination however the literature provides few comprehensive investigations of the magnitude and nature of vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of surficial aquitards two general categories of hydraulic methods are used to determine kv laboratory measurements on core samples and field hydraulic tests where an overlying or underlying aquifer is pumped with pore pressure monitoring of response in the aquitard in depth reviews of field methods are provided by neuzil 1986 van der kamp 2001 cherry et al 2006 and batlle aguilar et al 2016 williams and farvolden 1967 were the first to report on aquitard kv based on piezometer time series hydraulic head monitoring in a clayey glacial till in illinois and concluded that the rapid piezometer responses required the aquitard to have hydraulically active vertical fractures wolff 1970 describes a field study where a surficial aquifer was pumped and piezometers in the underlying clayey aquitard responded very slowly over many weeks this slow response was accounted for quantitatively using an analytical 1 d transient flow model with input values for hydraulic diffusivity that matched well with independent laboratory tests on undisturbed core samples suggesting a lack of secondary pathways such as fractures grisak and cherry 1975 provide a much different result in an aquifer pumping test with monitoring of piezometers in an overlying surficial clayey aquitard at a waste disposal site in manitoba where rapid and strong response in some of the aquitard piezometers to the aquifer drawdown suggested the presence of through going fractures however some of the aquitard piezometers did not respond over the 30 day period of the test likely because these piezometer screens were not as proximate to widely spaced features such as fractures or other preferential pathways in such a scenario it only takes rapid response in one piezometer to indicate the presence of through going fractures the lab derived kv values from oedometer tests were about two orders of magnitude lower than the field bulk kv derived from numerical modeling of piezometer responses to pumping with the difference attributed to presence of vertical fractures davis 1972 describes use of natural hydraulic transients to study hydraulic diffusivity of aquitards including propagation of response across low permeability units from monitoring aquifers above and below the aquitard keller et al 1989 compare field scale measurements of kv derived from analysis of downward propagation of seasonal water table fluctuations in an oxidized clayey till into an underlying unoxidized till via piezometric monitoring with field slug tests and laboratory consolidation and permeameter tests at a site in saskatchewan they found that the field scale results compared well with those from the small scale laboratory tests and attributed this to lack of fractures in the unoxidized till döll and schneider 1995 applied several field methods including slug tests pumping tests of an underlying aquifer with aquitard monitoring and tidal propagation from the aquifer into the aquitard and noted larger scale field tests generally provided larger kv values than laboratory permeameter tests but at this site did not indicate the influence of secondary permeability features such as fractures the studies reported above and others show that comparison of small scale laboratory tests on core samples with larger scale field values derived from piezometer response to pumping tests or natural transients can provide some evidence for the presence or absence of secondary pathways or other types of heterogeneity relevant to the effective field scale kv for clayey aquitards however they also highlight the difficulty in conclusively showing a lack of fractures and other preferential pathways as well as the need for multiple lines of evidence this paper concerns investigations of kv of a surficial clayey aquitard in the mississippi river valley near baton rouge louisiana at a chemical manufacturing facility overlying a regional sand gravel aquifer used for water supply parts of the gulf coast region have surficial aquitards overlying aquifers and the literature specific to hydrogeologic studies of these aquitards is limited to those of pleistocene origin e g hanor 1993 1995 cramer 1988 ppg 1995 such studies indicate the major influence of secondary permeability features such as fractures rootholes or burrows or stratigraphic windows based on evidence from pleistocene deposits cramer 1988 indicates the presence of secondary pathways should be taken as the expected condition of surficial aquitards in louisiana however surficial aquitards in the mississippi river valley are comprised of holocene deposits therefore this generalization may not be applicable because of differences in depositional origins and post depositional influences between pleistocene and holocene deposits kesel 2008 a unique approach was taken to investigate the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard at the study site the mississippi river channel eroded through the entire 30 m thickness of the aquitard and therefore the hydraulic connection laterally is rapid and direct from the river outward to the aquifer domain everywhere beneath the site robust determination of aquitard kv was enhanced by this hydraulic connection where large 7 m seasonal changes of river levels cause nearly as large a variation in hydraulic head at the base of the aquitard providing the opportunity to monitor propagation of this cyclical pressure pulse upward into the aquitard the goal was to determine whether or not fractures or other preferential pathways occur in the basal part of the aquitard and influence vertical flow a semi circular array of piezometers at various depths was installed across the aquitard at a location on the facility referred to as the detailed study site or dss fig 1 for long term monitoring of pressure response due to river stage variation along with a shorter pressure pulse imposed by an aquifer pumping test laboratory consolidation and permeameter tests were conducted on core samples to evaluate small scale kv at various depths for comparison to field derived values 2 study site and geological setting the study site is a large 750 ha chemical manufacturing facility that has been in operation since the early 1950s near plaquemine louisiana situated next to the mississippi river drainage canals throughout the site control hydraulic head in the surficial part of the aquitard the selection of the study site for this comprehensive assessment of the magnitude and nature of the hydraulic conductivity of a holocene aquitard was guided by a previous study of this area by kesel 2008 who reported on the age and depositional environments of the sediment layers comprising the aquitard fig 1a shows the overall site area and proximity to the mississippi river inset shows the dss and fig 1b shows a schematic cross section from the river through the dss fig 2 shows the hydrogeologic setting and stratigraphy of the regional surficial aquitard known as the top stratum whiteman 1972 that overlies the upper pleistocene aquifer kesel 2008 examined cores and obtained numerous carbon 14 dates to determine the deposition times and rates of the top stratum at the study site these studies show the aquitard has two main parts 1 an upper unit comprised primarily of overbank and backswamp deposits associated with the ancestral mississippi river and 2 a lower unit comprised of lacustrine deposits in lakes formed of flood waters from the ancestral mississippi river both types of deposits are widespread components of the aquitard in the lower mississippi river valley krinitzsky and smith 1969 but field scale information on hydraulic conductivity of these units is lacking in addition to detailed geologic information abundant information is available from geotechnical studies conducted for facility development providing a framework for extrapolation of findings from this site to other areas in the mississippi river valley with similar deposits the impetus for the current hydraulic study was the need to assess the potential for contaminant migration through the aquitard 3 methods 3 1 core collection and laboratory tests continuous cores were collected at two locations at the dss using two methods 1 sonic techniques were used in february 2003 to collect cores for stratigraphic characterization and installation of a 1 5 m long well screened in the upper portion of the upper plaquemine aquifer pz 60 and 2 mud rotary techniques were employed in february 2005 with continuous sampling using 7 6 cm diameter thin walled shelby tubes advanced ahead of the mud rotary casing borehole designated as laob 23 these shelby samples table 1 were collected continuously in 0 61 m runs from 15 8 to 29 2 m bgs spanning the lower unit 22 samples total the ends were sealed with wax for moisture preservation in the field and the samples were shipped on ice to a geotechnical testing lab where they were stored in a cold room prior to testing these cores were extruded in early 2008 during which time the cores were examined in detail photographed and subsamples collected for various measurements including moisture content astm d2216 98 specific gravity astm d854 02 particle size distribution via hydrometer analysis astm d422 63 total organic carbon content walkley black wet oxidation method wet and dry unit weight astm d7263 09 total porosity estimated from density and specific gravity atterberg limits astm d43118 00 flexible wall permeameter tests for vertical hydraulic conductivity astm d5084 00 and consolidation oedometer tests for compressibility and vertical hydraulic conductivity astm d2435 04 using two different effective stress ranges for each sample table 1 3 2 piezometer installations and monitoring piezometers were installed in march 2003 in a semi circle equidistant around a large diameter pumping well tw 1 screened below the aquitard over the upper 30 m of the aquifer fig 3 this layout which was designed in a manner similar to wolff 1970 allows the hydraulic response during a pumping test to be similar in the aquifer below each piezometer location i e assuming radial drawdown a major component of the investigations was to determine aquitard hydraulic properties by monitoring response or hydraulic head propagation due to natural river stage fluctuations fig 4 a and during a pumping test fig 4b c upward through the lower part of the aquitard using a detailed cluster of piezometers distributed vertically across the aquitard fig 3 two piezometer types were installed 1 drive point piezometers dpps for hydraulic head monitoring and groundwater sampling and 2 vibrating wire piezometers vwps for head monitoring only dpps were comprised of stainless steel piezometer tips with a length of 40 cm and diameter of 3 1 cm perforated with many screened circular ports and wrapped on the outside with geotextile fabric the cone shaped piezometer tip had a slightly larger diameter than the rest of the piezometer to prevent clogging during installation piezometers were connected to 0 95 cm id polyethylene tubing at the top of the perforated tip extending to ground surface within 1 9 cm id steel pipe in the upper 9 m the tubing and steel pipe diameters were increased to 2 5 cm id and 3 2 cm id respectively to allow insertion of pressure transducers in situ inc minitroll non vented 1 8 cm diameter which were sealed above with an inflatable packer intended to minimize time lag effects dpps were installed within 8 2 cm od casing advanced using direct push methods to approximately 3 m above the desired installation depth and then advanced pushed or hammered to the target depth below the casing bentonite slurry was emplaced via a tremie tube to fill the annular space during casing removal vwps were geokon model 4500dp drive point piezometers with cone tips these were installed in a manner similar to the dpps except with pushing only to avoid damaging the devices and bentonite slurry was used to fill the annular space between the casing and signal cable as the casing was removed duplicate vwps two at the same depth interval and triplicate dpps three at the same depth interval were installed at two different depths at separate locations around the semi circle to evaluate variability vwps were installed at similar depths as dpps to allow comparison between piezometer types conventional short screened wells previously installed across the site including locations with paired piezometers in the upper aquitard unit and underlying aquifer provide insight on vertical gradients across the lower aquitard unit as background information for the current study the dpps were sampled shortly after installation in april 2003 and then were used only for hydraulic monitoring thereafter the dpps were monitored in different ways during the course of the study initially water levels were monitored manually during several snapshots before and after the sampling episode then continuous hydraulic monitoring was done using the pressure transducer readings at 30 min intervals transducer monitoring was conducted between mid may and early december 2003 except for a few week period following the pumping test when manual dpp monitoring was done from december 2003 to january 2005 dpp monitoring was done under open conditions via manual readings with a narrow diameter water level meter monitoring was then discontinued to minimize time lag effects during this time a 0 63 cm id polyethylene tube was sealed within the larger 2 5 cm id polyethylene tube section using a packer manual monitoring was done for about 180 snapshots at a frequency ranging from 1 to 21 days average of 2 2 days during the transducer and manual monitoring periods the dpps had issues with packers losing pressure requiring re inflation which affected some of the results when packers lost pressure the head equalized with whatever the head was in the larger tube and then had to recover to the actual and temporally variable head during the period between losing pressure and re inflation time lag effects associated with the larger diameter tubing were greater thus temporal monitoring data from the vwps are considered more accurate for hydraulic response modeling than the dpps as the vwp data are unaffected by packer issues and time lag effects however the dpps provide more spatial detail with more depths monitored across the aquitard and thus provide much insight from hydraulic head profiles the assessment of the lower aquitard unit included hydraulic head monitoring with emphasis on the lower portion of this unit during a pumping test to determine aquitard hydraulic response to induced head changes in the aquifer due to pumping a large capacity pumping well tw 1 with a diameter of 25 cm was installed for the pumping test screened in the aquifer from 30 to 60 m bgs fig 3 the pumping test was conducted over a 32 day period in september october 2003 during a period of low river stage with rates of 63 l s 1000 gpm for the first 5 days and then 88 l s 1400 gpm thereafter this pumping caused a maximum drawdown in the aquifer along the monitoring circle pz 60 of about 2 5 m fig 4b drawdown in the aquifer during the pumping test was affected by a pump failure as well as a large rise in the river stage of about 2 m during this period following the pumping test monitoring of the dpps and vwps was continued for a 15 month period from october 2003 to january 2005 during which time the head in the aquifer went through several oscillations and varied by a maximum of about 5 5 m dampened a bit from the maximum river stage variation at the site of about 7 0 m fig 4c this natural variation in aquifer head due to river stage variation turned out to be a much more useful stressor to the system for evaluation of aquitard kv than the pumping test 4 results 4 1 aquitard properties from laboratory tests fig 2c shows generalized stratigraphy at pz 60 and fig 5 shows photos of selected core samples from the lacustrine unit results of the laboratory testing on shelby samples are summarized in table 1 the lab reported coefficient of compressibility av was converted to compressibility α using α a v 1 e o where eo initial void ratio compressibility was converted to specific storage ss using s s ρ g α n β where ρ water density g gravity constant α soil compressibility n porosity and β water compressibility for these highly compressible clays water compressibility is negligible so s s ρ g α fig 6 shows laboratory derived values for porosity ss from consolidation tests and kv from flexible wall permeameter and consolidation tests versus depth within the lower aquitard unit porosity ranged from 54 to 63 with an average of 58 fig 6a and ss ranged from 2 2 10 3 to 3 9 10 3 m 1 with an average of 2 9 10 3 m 1 fig 6b α ranged from 2 3 10 7 to 4 0 10 7 m2 n with an average of 3 0 10 7 m2 n which is within the range of reported values for clays of 10 6 10 8 m2 n freeze and cherry 1979 table 2 5 kv values range from 7 10 11 to 3 10 9 m s with permeameter values grouping towards the lower end and oedometer values at the higher end of this range fig 6c average kv from permeameter and oedometer tests two effective stress ranges for the lower unit were 1 6 10 10 and 7 7 10 10 m s and the geometric means were 1 3 10 10 and 5 6 10 10 m s respectively hydraulic diffusivity d kv ss of the lower unit spans two orders of magnitude ranging from 1 5 10 8 to 1 5 10 6 m2 s with an arithmetic average of 3 0 10 7 m2 s and geometric mean of 1 9 10 7 m2 s laboratory results from this study are comparable with previous studies provided in site geotechnical reports buchanan and associates 1957 and several others summarized by fugro south inc 2002 these previous geotechnical studies also recognize based solely on test results without consideration of geological characteristics and depositional history the lower unit as a distinct entity for example the fugro south inc 2002 report separates the aquitard lithology into two distinct zones approx 0 20 m bgs as overconsolidated clays corresponding with the upper unit and approx 20 30 m bgs as normally consolidated clays corresponding with the lower unit this division is evident in a plot of overconsolidation ratio versus depth fig 2b for numerous consolidation tests on site samples preconsolidation of shallower upper unit soils can likely be attributed to desiccation and weathering processes as opposed to past geological loading as explained by terzaghi et al 1996 4 2 aquitard properties from field piezometric observations hydraulic head variation in the aquifer under two conditions were used to evaluate aquitard properties 1 short term pumping test and 2 extended period of large natural variation in river stage 4 2 1 pumping test the 32 day pumping test was conducted in september october 2003 during a period of low aquifer hydraulic head i e low river stage that followed a 6 m decline in the preceding months fig 4c during the pumping test tw 1 was initially pumped at 63 l s for the first 5 days causing a maximum drawdown of about 2 0 m in the aquifer at pz 60 then the rate was increased to 88 l s and drawdown increased to about 2 7 m fig 4b the rate increase was intended to cause larger drawdown to produce a greater hydraulic pulse for observing response in the aquitard natural variation in head in the aquifer due to river stage variation is superimposed on and affected the pumping test drawdown during the initial 8 days of the pumping test the pump and monitoring devices performed well and none of the piezometers in the lower aquitard unit showed rapid response that would suggest the presence of fractures however the large natural head variation made it difficult to separate out effects of the pumping test alone to determine aquitard hydraulic parameters then problems were encountered including pump failure and apparent breach of the annular seal around the tw 1 casing within the aquitard which allowed transmission of hydraulic response vertically in the aquitard up the annular space around the pumping well and then laterally in the aquitard within layers with higher horizontal hydraulic conductivity e g silty or sandy seams or peat beds this caused rapid and large responses and depressurization of portions of the aquitard particularly in the upper portion of the lower aquitard unit these problems resulted in the later pumping test data being unreliable effects of depressurization lingered for several months and thus these data are not included here instead the focus is on aquifer head changes imposed by river stage variation 4 2 2 river stage influence on aquifer hydraulic head aquifer head changes imposed by river stage variation were much larger than those from the pumping test and monitoring was done over a sufficiently long period to provide a more useful dataset for evaluation of aquitard properties fig 4a shows the historical record of river stage from 2000 to 2005 from a monitoring station at baton rouge btr about 12 km upstream of the site indicating a reasonably consistent annual and seasonal pattern with a typical annual range peak to trough of about 9 m the highest river stage generally occurs in the late winter or spring and the lowest in fall or early winter fig 4b shows a comparison of btr river stage with river stage at the site dock 1 fig 1 and hydraulic head at the piezometer at the top of the aquifer at the study site pz 60 between april 2003 and january 2005 variation in hydraulic head in the aquifer during the monitoring period was about 5 m and closely tracks the river although with dampened response for modeling aquitard hydraulic response a correlation was developed between pz 60 head and btr river stage data in fig 4c to take advantage of long term btr stage data from the u s army corps of engineers http www2 mvr usace army mil applying a linear correlation between the btr stage and aquifer pz 60 head provided the relation 1 synthetic aquifer head m btr stage m 0 72 0 25 this allows estimation of hydraulic head in the aquifer at the study site in the absence of pz 60 data for modeling of aquitard response the best fit r2 0 98 was obtained with pz 60 data time shifted by 2 days which may be attributed to the lag time for transmission of head changes over the 1 5 km distance between the river and study area 4 2 3 hydraulic head profiles and temporal trends the fifteen month period of hydraulic monitoring following the pumping test october 2003 to january 2005 where hydraulic head in the aquifer varies by 5 m due to river stage variation fig 4c provided the best dataset for evaluation of aquitard properties and hydraulic evidence for secondary pathways across the lower aquitard unit for a few months after the pumping test some piezometers showed lingering effects following depressurization discussed above therefore only data collected after january 2004 are presented here when these effects were largely diminished fig 7 shows hydrographs for piezometers grouped by hydrogeologic unit along with aquifer head for comparison over a one year period fig 8 shows aquifer and transition zone hydrographs over a six month period from june 2004 to january 2005 fig 8a and representative head profiles from manual dpp monitoring fig 8b piezometers in the upper unit 20 m show minimal temporal head variability fig 7a and little change with depth fig 8b the water table in this area is controlled by a nearby canal 30 m which maintains the level at about 5 1 m msl mean sea level for reference ground surface and canal bottom elevations are about 6 7 m and 3 7 m msl respectively the minimal head variability with depth suggests relatively large bulk kv of the upper unit consistent with secondary features associated with its depositional origin such as fractures rootholes and bio disturbances krinitzsky and smith 1969 which greatly enhance kv such that large vertical head differentials cannot exist the dominant general direction of flow in the upper unit must be horizontal because downward flow through the lower unit is restricted a large change in the shape of the head profiles occurs at about 20 m bgs fig 8b indicating a major change in hydrogeologic properties coincident with the interface between the upper backswamp and lower lacustrine units identified by kesel 2008 piezometers in the lacustrine unit show larger but orderly head variation fig 7b with the largest variation closer to the aquifer interface the long term average flow direction appears to be downward across the lower aquitard unit because on average the head just above the top of this unit base of upper aquitard is higher than the average head just below it transition zone and aquifer this causes the relatively steady downward slope in head profiles within the upper part of the lacustrine unit fig 8b while the lower part shows more transience as it responds to the large aquifer head variations another indication of net downward direction of flow across the lower unit is apparent from comparisons of head in the upper unit with the aquifer while pz 60 data fig 7 do not cover a sufficiently long period to establish definitive trends the longer term head in the aquifer over a 10 year period 1995 2005 was estimated using btr records and eq 1 this estimation indicated a time weighted average head of about 4 5 m msl which is about 0 6 m lower than the head in the upper unit fig 7a assuming an 8 m thickness of the lower unit indicates a long term downward hydraulic gradient of about 0 075 which is generally consistent with site estimates based on data from paired piezometers screened in the upper unit and aquifer the largest variations are observed in a thin transition zone between the top of the aquifer and the bottom of the lower aquitard unit which closely tracks the aquifer head fig 7c this zone is designated as a transition zone because the geology is transitional in its textural characteristics and has post depositional influences kesel 2008 describes the transition zone as a red to buff oxidized zone silty clay some sand and organic matter and indicates that sediments of this zone were subjected to subaerial exposure of the river deposited sediment of the aquifer prior to deposition of the lacustrine sediments the aquifer sand and gravel sediments were deposited in the ancestral mississippi river while the sediments that make up the transition zone are mostly clays and silts the apparent larger kv is likely due to effects of fractures caused by subaerial exposure or perhaps interconnected sandy seams with substantial vertical connectivity the elevated kv of the transition zone means that in the context of hydraulic head variations this zone is effectively part of the aquifer therefore the propagation of head variations upward into the lower aquitard unit effectively begins at the top of the transition zone the head differential in the aquifer cycle was about 5 m during the monitoring period but in the middle of the lower aquitard unit the maximum temporal variation was much smaller only about 1 2 m fig 7b none of the piezometers in the lower aquitard unit responded markedly to large cyclical head variation in the aquifer providing no indication of vertical pathways due to secondary permeability features the dampened hydraulic response appears to be governed by low kv and high ss producing low hydraulic diffusivity kv ss of the lacustrine sediment which is examined below 4 3 numerical modeling of aquitard hydraulic response modeling of the hydraulic response data was conducted to evaluate hydraulic properties i e hydraulic diffusivity of the lacustrine unit using 1 d simulations fit to the monitoring data from the lower aquitard unit 2 d simulations were then conducted to evaluate the transient nature of the head profiles across the entire aquitard sequence for stylistic comparison with the field profiles 4 3 1 one dimensional transient flow simulations numerical modeling of lower aquitard unit hydraulic response was performed for the 15 month post pumping test monitoring period during which time large head changes occurred in the underlying aquifer due to river stage variation the transient evolution of head perturbations in the aquifer caused by river stage into the overlying lacustrine unit assuming homogeneous and isotropic conditions with vertical flow governed by intergranular flow with absence of secondary pathways e g fractures or rootholes can be described by the 1 d equation for transient saturated flow 2 2 h z 2 s s k v h t where h hydraulic head z distance into the aquitard ss specific storage and kv vertical hydraulic conductivity hydraulic diffusivity d is defined as kv ss a numerical approach for solution of eq 2 was applied given the variable nature of the hydraulic perturbations which differs from prior studies that used analytical solutions assuming sinusoidal fluctuations e g keller et al 1989 döll and schneider 1995 the approach taken here was to incorporate a finite difference solution in an excel spreadsheet eq 2 can be expressed in finite difference form as 3 h i 1 j 2 h i j h i 1 j δ z 2 s s k h i j 1 h i j δ t where i j designate the node numbers in the spatial and temporal directions respectively and δx and δt designate the discretization letting 4 ρ k s s δ t δ z 2 allows the finite difference equation to be arranged as 5 h i j 1 1 2 ρ h i j ρ h i 1 j h i 1 j which allows the head at a node for the next time step to be calculated from the head at that node and the adjacent two nodes for the preceding time step for stability the value of 1 2ρ must be kept positive to avoid an oscillatory solution therefore ρ 1 2 which is satisfied when 6 δ t s s δ z 2 2 k spatial and temporal discretization must also consider the rate of head change at the boundary and propagation into the aquitard in this case the grid discretization applied was 0 10 m and the time step was 0 05 days tighter spatial and temporal discretization was tested to ensure simulation accuracy along with verification by comparison with simulation results from a finite element numerical model hydrogeosphere therrien and sudicky 1996 http www aquanty com hydrogeosphere the advantage of the numerical solution using excel is that effects of parameter changes are quickly displayed in graphs linked to spreadsheet rows or columns showing how the solution changes in real time as input parameters are modified thus enabling easy comparison with field data fig 9 shows the model domain and boundary conditions for the 1 d simulations the interface between the transition zone and lower aquitard unit was assumed at 28 5 m bgs midway between piezometers at 29 5 m bgs within the transition zone that closely track head in the aquifer and those at 27 4 m that show a delayed and dampened response pz 60 cores fig 2c show the aquifer interface at 32 0 m bgs which translates to an assumed transition zone thickness of 3 5 m clear evidence of a transition zone break was not evident in cores except for observations of lower plasticity and minor oxidation closer to the aquifer also the last shelby tube core from laob 23 from 28 7 to 29 3 m bgs had a higher sand content 30 than shallower cores table 1 for the lower boundary the head in the aquifer from pz 60 or synthetic head estimated from eq 1 when data were not available was applied which closely tracks head in the transition zone from vwp 97b at 29 6 m bgs fig 9b this is the most representative measure of head at the base of the lacustrine unit the upper model boundary at the top of the lower unit was assumed to occur at 20 5 m bgs midway between piezometers at 19 8 m bgs that showed no response fig 7a and those at 21 3 m bgs that responded slowly fig 7b and where the break in behavior occurs in hydraulic head profiles fig 8b thus the lower aquitard unit has an assumed thickness of 8 0 m for simulation purposes a constant head of 5 1 m was applied at the upper boundary consistent with the nearly uniform and steady head in the upper unit fig 7a 8b the graphs in fig 10 compare simulated versus field measured hydraulic head in piezometers within the lower unit at depths of 27 4 25 9 and 24 4 m bgs which represent distances of 1 2 2 7 and 4 2 m respectively from the assumed transition zone interface as shown on the graphs a value for hydraulic diffusivity of d 2 0 10 7 m2 s provides a good fit to the field profiles particularly for piezometers closest to the lower boundary fig 10a a value five times higher d 1 0 10 6 m2 s clearly overestimates the magnitude of response and five times lower d 4 0 10 8 m2 s clearly underestimates the response some of the erratic readings at dpp 85 fig 10b and to a lesser extent at dpp 80a 80b and 80c fig 10c are artifacts of packer issues discussed earlier the earlier data at dpp 85 and dpp 80a 80b and 80c also show remnant effects during recovery from the pumping test depressurization for a few months the poorer quality of the fits with distance upward into the lacustrine unit is likely an artifact of scale and spatial variability in hydraulic parameters the modeling assumes uniform parameters i e kv and ss throughout the lacustrine unit but in reality these parameters vary spatially which is evident from laboratory measurements fig 6b 6c table 1 and textural variation in cores fig 11 shows a comparison of field versus simulated hydraulic head profiles in the lower unit for several snapshots between june 2004 and january 2005 using the best fit hydraulic diffusivity demonstrating reasonable agreement with trends and magnitudes of observed responses applying the geometric mean ss derived from the lab consolidation tests 2 9 10 3 m 1 with the best fit d derived from evaluation of the field data provides a bulk kv of 5 8 10 10 m s which is at the higher end of the range obtained from laboratory tests fig 6 table 1 nearly a factor of 5 higher than the geometric mean from permeameter tests 1 3 10 10 m s but close to the mean from consolidation tests 5 6 10 10 m s these results are consistent with other aquitard studies identifying issues of scale on kv wolff 1970 prudic 1982 herzog and morse 1986 döll and schneider 1995 that generally show larger values from larger scale field hydraulic tests compared to laboratory tests on small core samples while in some cases higher kv in larger scale field measurements versus small scale lab measurements is an indication of fractures or other secondary permeability features in this case the differences are small and attributed to heterogeneity in anisotropy and 3d permeability distribution affecting field measurements in the lacustrine unit if fractures are present in the lacustrine unit they must be either discontinuous non connected fractures and or closed fractures from a hydraulic response perspective in any case the kv of the lacustrine unit derived from field data is still extremely low and consistent with hydraulic responses governed by low intergranular hydraulic conductivity and large storativity of the lacustrine sediments without influence of fractures or other preferential flow paths the average downward groundwater flow velocity v across the lower aquitard unit can be estimated using 7 v q n k v i n where q darcy flux i average hydraulic gradient and n effective porosity applying kv estimated from field data 5 8 10 10 m s a long term average gradient i 0 075 and average porosity n 0 58 gives a groundwater velocity in the lacustrine unit of about 2 mm year this estimated value for the average long term groundwater velocity in the lower unit may appear to be exceptionally small however it is of the same general magnitude obtained for other clayey aquitards of lacustrine origin remenda et al 1996 desaulniers and cherry 1988 parker et al 2004 batlle aguilar et al 2016 at such a low velocity it would take a few thousand years for a water molecule to travel through the 8 m or so thick lower aquitard unit at such low advection diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism for solutes migrating through this unit either upward or downward gillham and cherry 1982 parker et al 2004 4 3 2 two dimensional stylistic transient flow simulations two dimensional transient flow simulations illustrate contrasting conditions for two competing scenarios 1 scenario a with an aquitard with partially penetrating fractures with an underlying unfractured lacustrine zone fig 12 a as evidenced from this study and 2 scenario b with fully penetrating fractures across the lacustrine unit fig 12b these utilized two numerical models fractran sudicky and mclaren 1992 which is a 2 d model for steady state groundwater flow and transient contaminant transport in discretely fractured media and hydrogeosphere therrien and sudicky 1996 brunner and simmons 2012 which is a 3 d model that can accommodate transient flow and transport in variably saturated porous and discretely fractured media fractran was used for generation of the fracture networks and initial steady state flow simulations and then transient flow simulations were conducted using hydrogeosphere which has a built in routine for importing fractran grids and fracture networks scenarios were tailored to site conditions to the extent possible and show the general significance of the contrasting conditions however the fracture networks are hypothetical because the nature of fractures and other pathways in the upper unit was not studied in detail the model domain is cross sectional with a 30 m height consistent with the total aquitard thickness upper and lower units and width of 10 m in scenario a fig 12a fractures do not penetrate the bottom 8 m of the aquitard consistent with the lacustrine unit thickness at the site fractures have variable apertures with a mean of 100 μm in the upper 10 m that was then decreased to 50 μm concurrent with a lower fracture frequency below this depth and finally to no fractures penetrating the bottom 8 m in an alternative scenario b fig 12b fractures are fully penetrating across the lower unit the best fit hydraulic properties kv ss from the 1 d simulations were used for the entire aquitard except in the upper zone where the bulk kv is significantly enhanced by fractures flow boundary conditions consist of a constant head of 5 0 m applied to the top boundary and variable head at the bottom boundary consistent with transient aquifer head same as 1 d simulations the plots in fig 12 show the simulated fracture network and hydraulic head contours for april 2003 along with hydraulic head profiles at x 5 m for several time snapshots at four week intervals between june 2004 and january 2005 same time interval as field profiles in fig 8b and field and 1 d simulation profiles in fig 11 simulated profiles for the scenario with an unfractured lower unit fig 12a are consistent with field profiles fig 8b showing minimal variation throughout the upper fractured unit and significant variation in the lower part of the unfractured zone and even capture the nature of the bow shaped profile in the upper part of the unfractured zone simulated profiles for the alternative scenario with fully penetrating fractures fig 12b show the large hydraulic head variations at the bottom boundary penetrate upward through the entire aquitard thickness and do not match the nature of the field profiles these simulations are considered stylistic as the nature of the fracture distribution in the upper unit was not investigated in detail other than evidence in cores that it is densely fractured hydraulic response in piezometers depends on position relative to discrete fractures for example a piezometer positioned away from a vertical fracture will show a very different response than one intersecting a fracture farah et al 2012 making identification of widely spaced fractures challenging overall these simulations further support the interpretation of site conditions that show an unfractured lower aquitard unit strongly influences hydrogeologic fluxes and hydraulic response to large head changes in the underlying aquifer 5 summary of conclusions detailed hydraulic head profiles though the 30 m thick surficial aquitard at the study site show two distinct hydrogeologic units an upper unit with minimal head variation with depth and over time with the head constrained by the shallow drainage works and a lower unit that has larger but slow head variations due to the cyclical rise and fall of the mississippi river stage which is directly connected to the underlying aquifer the upper unit is comprised of interlayered backswamp and overbank deposits and flow is dominated by secondary permeability due to fractures and rootholes and other features caused by plant growth organisms and weathering in contrast the lower unit of lacustrine origin shows no evidence of secondary permeability modeling the hydraulic response of the lower unit to large head changes in the underlying aquifer provided a best fit hydraulic diffusivity kv ss and kv within but near the upper end of the range of values obtained from laboratory tests on core samples while there are minor uncertainties associated with the field scale values mostly related to the selection of the exact position of the bottom of the aquitard and influence of 3 d heterogeneity in the lacustrine unit related to small scale lens like stratification of the clay silt and fine sand components results show the hydraulic response in the lacustrine portion of the aquitard is governed by its very low intergranular k and large storativity consistent with lack of fractures or other preferential pathways although widely spaced discontinuities such as fractures or other higher k features across the lower aquitard unit cannot be ruled out definitely none of the high resolution field data and multiple lines of evidence collected to rigorously test this suggests this possibility if fractures do exist in the lacustrine unit they must either be discontinuous non connected fractures and or closed fractures at the study site scale this finding is consistent with geologic origin and geotechnical properties kesel 2008 indicates lacustrine origin with the largest sediment deposition rates for this part of the aquitard and geotechnical studies indicate that this clayey sediment is normally consolidated and very plastic the finding that the holocene age lacustrine aquitard unit has very low kv with no evidence of secondary permeability features providing excellent protection of the underlying aquifers from surficial contamination sources has relevance to other parts of the mississippi river valley where lacustrine deposits overlain by backswamp deposits are known to occur this is in contrast to existing reports on other aquitard types in louisiana that are pleistocene age where significant control of groundwater flow by secondary permeability features has been observed the general approach used in this study taking advantage of natural head perturbations in an adjacent aquifer unit in this case due to river connection with significant stage variation combined with temporal depth discrete monitoring in the aquitard has merits for application to any similar surficial clayey aquitard acknowledgements the field data for

7468,the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of a 30 m thick surficial clayey aquitard overlying a regional aquifer at an industrial site in the mississippi river valley in louisiana was investigated via intensive hydraulic characterization using high resolution vertical hydraulic head profiles with temporal monitoring and laboratory tests a study area was instrumented with a semi circular array of piezometers at many depths in the aquitard at equal distance from a large capacity pumping well including replicate piezometers profiles showed negligible head differential to 20 m bgs below which there was an abrupt change in vertical gradients over the lower 8 10 m of the aquitard hydraulic characteristics are strongly associated with depositional environment the upper zone of minimal head differentials with depth and minimal variation over time correlates with paleo mississippi river backswamp deposits while the lower zone with large head differentials and slow but moderate head changes correlates with lacustrine deposits the lower zone restricts groundwater flow between the surface and underlying regional aquifer which is hydraulically connected to the mississippi river lab tests on lacustrine samples show low kv 8 10 11 4 10 9 m s bracketing field estimates 6 10 10 m s from 1 d model fits to piezometric data in response to large aquifer head changes the slow response indicates absence of through going open fractures in the lacustrine unit consistent with geotechnical properties high plasticity normal consolidation suggesting high integrity that protects the underlying aquifer from surficial contamination the lack of vertical gradients in the overlying backswamp unit indicates abundant secondary permeability features e g fractures rootholes consistent with depositional and weathering conditions 2 d stylized transient flow simulations including both units supports this interpretation other published reports on surficial aquitards in the gulf coast region pertain to pleistocene deposits that lack laterally extensive lacustrine units and where kv is enhanced by secondary permeability features resulting in clayey aquitards with poor integrity keywords clayey aquitard integrity hydraulic conductivity storativity hydraulic diffusivity fractures 1 introduction many potable water aquifers are overlain by surficial clayey aquitards governing groundwater recharge and providing some degree of protection from near surface sources of contamination however the literature provides few comprehensive investigations of the magnitude and nature of vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of surficial aquitards two general categories of hydraulic methods are used to determine kv laboratory measurements on core samples and field hydraulic tests where an overlying or underlying aquifer is pumped with pore pressure monitoring of response in the aquitard in depth reviews of field methods are provided by neuzil 1986 van der kamp 2001 cherry et al 2006 and batlle aguilar et al 2016 williams and farvolden 1967 were the first to report on aquitard kv based on piezometer time series hydraulic head monitoring in a clayey glacial till in illinois and concluded that the rapid piezometer responses required the aquitard to have hydraulically active vertical fractures wolff 1970 describes a field study where a surficial aquifer was pumped and piezometers in the underlying clayey aquitard responded very slowly over many weeks this slow response was accounted for quantitatively using an analytical 1 d transient flow model with input values for hydraulic diffusivity that matched well with independent laboratory tests on undisturbed core samples suggesting a lack of secondary pathways such as fractures grisak and cherry 1975 provide a much different result in an aquifer pumping test with monitoring of piezometers in an overlying surficial clayey aquitard at a waste disposal site in manitoba where rapid and strong response in some of the aquitard piezometers to the aquifer drawdown suggested the presence of through going fractures however some of the aquitard piezometers did not respond over the 30 day period of the test likely because these piezometer screens were not as proximate to widely spaced features such as fractures or other preferential pathways in such a scenario it only takes rapid response in one piezometer to indicate the presence of through going fractures the lab derived kv values from oedometer tests were about two orders of magnitude lower than the field bulk kv derived from numerical modeling of piezometer responses to pumping with the difference attributed to presence of vertical fractures davis 1972 describes use of natural hydraulic transients to study hydraulic diffusivity of aquitards including propagation of response across low permeability units from monitoring aquifers above and below the aquitard keller et al 1989 compare field scale measurements of kv derived from analysis of downward propagation of seasonal water table fluctuations in an oxidized clayey till into an underlying unoxidized till via piezometric monitoring with field slug tests and laboratory consolidation and permeameter tests at a site in saskatchewan they found that the field scale results compared well with those from the small scale laboratory tests and attributed this to lack of fractures in the unoxidized till döll and schneider 1995 applied several field methods including slug tests pumping tests of an underlying aquifer with aquitard monitoring and tidal propagation from the aquifer into the aquitard and noted larger scale field tests generally provided larger kv values than laboratory permeameter tests but at this site did not indicate the influence of secondary permeability features such as fractures the studies reported above and others show that comparison of small scale laboratory tests on core samples with larger scale field values derived from piezometer response to pumping tests or natural transients can provide some evidence for the presence or absence of secondary pathways or other types of heterogeneity relevant to the effective field scale kv for clayey aquitards however they also highlight the difficulty in conclusively showing a lack of fractures and other preferential pathways as well as the need for multiple lines of evidence this paper concerns investigations of kv of a surficial clayey aquitard in the mississippi river valley near baton rouge louisiana at a chemical manufacturing facility overlying a regional sand gravel aquifer used for water supply parts of the gulf coast region have surficial aquitards overlying aquifers and the literature specific to hydrogeologic studies of these aquitards is limited to those of pleistocene origin e g hanor 1993 1995 cramer 1988 ppg 1995 such studies indicate the major influence of secondary permeability features such as fractures rootholes or burrows or stratigraphic windows based on evidence from pleistocene deposits cramer 1988 indicates the presence of secondary pathways should be taken as the expected condition of surficial aquitards in louisiana however surficial aquitards in the mississippi river valley are comprised of holocene deposits therefore this generalization may not be applicable because of differences in depositional origins and post depositional influences between pleistocene and holocene deposits kesel 2008 a unique approach was taken to investigate the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard at the study site the mississippi river channel eroded through the entire 30 m thickness of the aquitard and therefore the hydraulic connection laterally is rapid and direct from the river outward to the aquifer domain everywhere beneath the site robust determination of aquitard kv was enhanced by this hydraulic connection where large 7 m seasonal changes of river levels cause nearly as large a variation in hydraulic head at the base of the aquitard providing the opportunity to monitor propagation of this cyclical pressure pulse upward into the aquitard the goal was to determine whether or not fractures or other preferential pathways occur in the basal part of the aquitard and influence vertical flow a semi circular array of piezometers at various depths was installed across the aquitard at a location on the facility referred to as the detailed study site or dss fig 1 for long term monitoring of pressure response due to river stage variation along with a shorter pressure pulse imposed by an aquifer pumping test laboratory consolidation and permeameter tests were conducted on core samples to evaluate small scale kv at various depths for comparison to field derived values 2 study site and geological setting the study site is a large 750 ha chemical manufacturing facility that has been in operation since the early 1950s near plaquemine louisiana situated next to the mississippi river drainage canals throughout the site control hydraulic head in the surficial part of the aquitard the selection of the study site for this comprehensive assessment of the magnitude and nature of the hydraulic conductivity of a holocene aquitard was guided by a previous study of this area by kesel 2008 who reported on the age and depositional environments of the sediment layers comprising the aquitard fig 1a shows the overall site area and proximity to the mississippi river inset shows the dss and fig 1b shows a schematic cross section from the river through the dss fig 2 shows the hydrogeologic setting and stratigraphy of the regional surficial aquitard known as the top stratum whiteman 1972 that overlies the upper pleistocene aquifer kesel 2008 examined cores and obtained numerous carbon 14 dates to determine the deposition times and rates of the top stratum at the study site these studies show the aquitard has two main parts 1 an upper unit comprised primarily of overbank and backswamp deposits associated with the ancestral mississippi river and 2 a lower unit comprised of lacustrine deposits in lakes formed of flood waters from the ancestral mississippi river both types of deposits are widespread components of the aquitard in the lower mississippi river valley krinitzsky and smith 1969 but field scale information on hydraulic conductivity of these units is lacking in addition to detailed geologic information abundant information is available from geotechnical studies conducted for facility development providing a framework for extrapolation of findings from this site to other areas in the mississippi river valley with similar deposits the impetus for the current hydraulic study was the need to assess the potential for contaminant migration through the aquitard 3 methods 3 1 core collection and laboratory tests continuous cores were collected at two locations at the dss using two methods 1 sonic techniques were used in february 2003 to collect cores for stratigraphic characterization and installation of a 1 5 m long well screened in the upper portion of the upper plaquemine aquifer pz 60 and 2 mud rotary techniques were employed in february 2005 with continuous sampling using 7 6 cm diameter thin walled shelby tubes advanced ahead of the mud rotary casing borehole designated as laob 23 these shelby samples table 1 were collected continuously in 0 61 m runs from 15 8 to 29 2 m bgs spanning the lower unit 22 samples total the ends were sealed with wax for moisture preservation in the field and the samples were shipped on ice to a geotechnical testing lab where they were stored in a cold room prior to testing these cores were extruded in early 2008 during which time the cores were examined in detail photographed and subsamples collected for various measurements including moisture content astm d2216 98 specific gravity astm d854 02 particle size distribution via hydrometer analysis astm d422 63 total organic carbon content walkley black wet oxidation method wet and dry unit weight astm d7263 09 total porosity estimated from density and specific gravity atterberg limits astm d43118 00 flexible wall permeameter tests for vertical hydraulic conductivity astm d5084 00 and consolidation oedometer tests for compressibility and vertical hydraulic conductivity astm d2435 04 using two different effective stress ranges for each sample table 1 3 2 piezometer installations and monitoring piezometers were installed in march 2003 in a semi circle equidistant around a large diameter pumping well tw 1 screened below the aquitard over the upper 30 m of the aquifer fig 3 this layout which was designed in a manner similar to wolff 1970 allows the hydraulic response during a pumping test to be similar in the aquifer below each piezometer location i e assuming radial drawdown a major component of the investigations was to determine aquitard hydraulic properties by monitoring response or hydraulic head propagation due to natural river stage fluctuations fig 4 a and during a pumping test fig 4b c upward through the lower part of the aquitard using a detailed cluster of piezometers distributed vertically across the aquitard fig 3 two piezometer types were installed 1 drive point piezometers dpps for hydraulic head monitoring and groundwater sampling and 2 vibrating wire piezometers vwps for head monitoring only dpps were comprised of stainless steel piezometer tips with a length of 40 cm and diameter of 3 1 cm perforated with many screened circular ports and wrapped on the outside with geotextile fabric the cone shaped piezometer tip had a slightly larger diameter than the rest of the piezometer to prevent clogging during installation piezometers were connected to 0 95 cm id polyethylene tubing at the top of the perforated tip extending to ground surface within 1 9 cm id steel pipe in the upper 9 m the tubing and steel pipe diameters were increased to 2 5 cm id and 3 2 cm id respectively to allow insertion of pressure transducers in situ inc minitroll non vented 1 8 cm diameter which were sealed above with an inflatable packer intended to minimize time lag effects dpps were installed within 8 2 cm od casing advanced using direct push methods to approximately 3 m above the desired installation depth and then advanced pushed or hammered to the target depth below the casing bentonite slurry was emplaced via a tremie tube to fill the annular space during casing removal vwps were geokon model 4500dp drive point piezometers with cone tips these were installed in a manner similar to the dpps except with pushing only to avoid damaging the devices and bentonite slurry was used to fill the annular space between the casing and signal cable as the casing was removed duplicate vwps two at the same depth interval and triplicate dpps three at the same depth interval were installed at two different depths at separate locations around the semi circle to evaluate variability vwps were installed at similar depths as dpps to allow comparison between piezometer types conventional short screened wells previously installed across the site including locations with paired piezometers in the upper aquitard unit and underlying aquifer provide insight on vertical gradients across the lower aquitard unit as background information for the current study the dpps were sampled shortly after installation in april 2003 and then were used only for hydraulic monitoring thereafter the dpps were monitored in different ways during the course of the study initially water levels were monitored manually during several snapshots before and after the sampling episode then continuous hydraulic monitoring was done using the pressure transducer readings at 30 min intervals transducer monitoring was conducted between mid may and early december 2003 except for a few week period following the pumping test when manual dpp monitoring was done from december 2003 to january 2005 dpp monitoring was done under open conditions via manual readings with a narrow diameter water level meter monitoring was then discontinued to minimize time lag effects during this time a 0 63 cm id polyethylene tube was sealed within the larger 2 5 cm id polyethylene tube section using a packer manual monitoring was done for about 180 snapshots at a frequency ranging from 1 to 21 days average of 2 2 days during the transducer and manual monitoring periods the dpps had issues with packers losing pressure requiring re inflation which affected some of the results when packers lost pressure the head equalized with whatever the head was in the larger tube and then had to recover to the actual and temporally variable head during the period between losing pressure and re inflation time lag effects associated with the larger diameter tubing were greater thus temporal monitoring data from the vwps are considered more accurate for hydraulic response modeling than the dpps as the vwp data are unaffected by packer issues and time lag effects however the dpps provide more spatial detail with more depths monitored across the aquitard and thus provide much insight from hydraulic head profiles the assessment of the lower aquitard unit included hydraulic head monitoring with emphasis on the lower portion of this unit during a pumping test to determine aquitard hydraulic response to induced head changes in the aquifer due to pumping a large capacity pumping well tw 1 with a diameter of 25 cm was installed for the pumping test screened in the aquifer from 30 to 60 m bgs fig 3 the pumping test was conducted over a 32 day period in september october 2003 during a period of low river stage with rates of 63 l s 1000 gpm for the first 5 days and then 88 l s 1400 gpm thereafter this pumping caused a maximum drawdown in the aquifer along the monitoring circle pz 60 of about 2 5 m fig 4b drawdown in the aquifer during the pumping test was affected by a pump failure as well as a large rise in the river stage of about 2 m during this period following the pumping test monitoring of the dpps and vwps was continued for a 15 month period from october 2003 to january 2005 during which time the head in the aquifer went through several oscillations and varied by a maximum of about 5 5 m dampened a bit from the maximum river stage variation at the site of about 7 0 m fig 4c this natural variation in aquifer head due to river stage variation turned out to be a much more useful stressor to the system for evaluation of aquitard kv than the pumping test 4 results 4 1 aquitard properties from laboratory tests fig 2c shows generalized stratigraphy at pz 60 and fig 5 shows photos of selected core samples from the lacustrine unit results of the laboratory testing on shelby samples are summarized in table 1 the lab reported coefficient of compressibility av was converted to compressibility α using α a v 1 e o where eo initial void ratio compressibility was converted to specific storage ss using s s ρ g α n β where ρ water density g gravity constant α soil compressibility n porosity and β water compressibility for these highly compressible clays water compressibility is negligible so s s ρ g α fig 6 shows laboratory derived values for porosity ss from consolidation tests and kv from flexible wall permeameter and consolidation tests versus depth within the lower aquitard unit porosity ranged from 54 to 63 with an average of 58 fig 6a and ss ranged from 2 2 10 3 to 3 9 10 3 m 1 with an average of 2 9 10 3 m 1 fig 6b α ranged from 2 3 10 7 to 4 0 10 7 m2 n with an average of 3 0 10 7 m2 n which is within the range of reported values for clays of 10 6 10 8 m2 n freeze and cherry 1979 table 2 5 kv values range from 7 10 11 to 3 10 9 m s with permeameter values grouping towards the lower end and oedometer values at the higher end of this range fig 6c average kv from permeameter and oedometer tests two effective stress ranges for the lower unit were 1 6 10 10 and 7 7 10 10 m s and the geometric means were 1 3 10 10 and 5 6 10 10 m s respectively hydraulic diffusivity d kv ss of the lower unit spans two orders of magnitude ranging from 1 5 10 8 to 1 5 10 6 m2 s with an arithmetic average of 3 0 10 7 m2 s and geometric mean of 1 9 10 7 m2 s laboratory results from this study are comparable with previous studies provided in site geotechnical reports buchanan and associates 1957 and several others summarized by fugro south inc 2002 these previous geotechnical studies also recognize based solely on test results without consideration of geological characteristics and depositional history the lower unit as a distinct entity for example the fugro south inc 2002 report separates the aquitard lithology into two distinct zones approx 0 20 m bgs as overconsolidated clays corresponding with the upper unit and approx 20 30 m bgs as normally consolidated clays corresponding with the lower unit this division is evident in a plot of overconsolidation ratio versus depth fig 2b for numerous consolidation tests on site samples preconsolidation of shallower upper unit soils can likely be attributed to desiccation and weathering processes as opposed to past geological loading as explained by terzaghi et al 1996 4 2 aquitard properties from field piezometric observations hydraulic head variation in the aquifer under two conditions were used to evaluate aquitard properties 1 short term pumping test and 2 extended period of large natural variation in river stage 4 2 1 pumping test the 32 day pumping test was conducted in september october 2003 during a period of low aquifer hydraulic head i e low river stage that followed a 6 m decline in the preceding months fig 4c during the pumping test tw 1 was initially pumped at 63 l s for the first 5 days causing a maximum drawdown of about 2 0 m in the aquifer at pz 60 then the rate was increased to 88 l s and drawdown increased to about 2 7 m fig 4b the rate increase was intended to cause larger drawdown to produce a greater hydraulic pulse for observing response in the aquitard natural variation in head in the aquifer due to river stage variation is superimposed on and affected the pumping test drawdown during the initial 8 days of the pumping test the pump and monitoring devices performed well and none of the piezometers in the lower aquitard unit showed rapid response that would suggest the presence of fractures however the large natural head variation made it difficult to separate out effects of the pumping test alone to determine aquitard hydraulic parameters then problems were encountered including pump failure and apparent breach of the annular seal around the tw 1 casing within the aquitard which allowed transmission of hydraulic response vertically in the aquitard up the annular space around the pumping well and then laterally in the aquitard within layers with higher horizontal hydraulic conductivity e g silty or sandy seams or peat beds this caused rapid and large responses and depressurization of portions of the aquitard particularly in the upper portion of the lower aquitard unit these problems resulted in the later pumping test data being unreliable effects of depressurization lingered for several months and thus these data are not included here instead the focus is on aquifer head changes imposed by river stage variation 4 2 2 river stage influence on aquifer hydraulic head aquifer head changes imposed by river stage variation were much larger than those from the pumping test and monitoring was done over a sufficiently long period to provide a more useful dataset for evaluation of aquitard properties fig 4a shows the historical record of river stage from 2000 to 2005 from a monitoring station at baton rouge btr about 12 km upstream of the site indicating a reasonably consistent annual and seasonal pattern with a typical annual range peak to trough of about 9 m the highest river stage generally occurs in the late winter or spring and the lowest in fall or early winter fig 4b shows a comparison of btr river stage with river stage at the site dock 1 fig 1 and hydraulic head at the piezometer at the top of the aquifer at the study site pz 60 between april 2003 and january 2005 variation in hydraulic head in the aquifer during the monitoring period was about 5 m and closely tracks the river although with dampened response for modeling aquitard hydraulic response a correlation was developed between pz 60 head and btr river stage data in fig 4c to take advantage of long term btr stage data from the u s army corps of engineers http www2 mvr usace army mil applying a linear correlation between the btr stage and aquifer pz 60 head provided the relation 1 synthetic aquifer head m btr stage m 0 72 0 25 this allows estimation of hydraulic head in the aquifer at the study site in the absence of pz 60 data for modeling of aquitard response the best fit r2 0 98 was obtained with pz 60 data time shifted by 2 days which may be attributed to the lag time for transmission of head changes over the 1 5 km distance between the river and study area 4 2 3 hydraulic head profiles and temporal trends the fifteen month period of hydraulic monitoring following the pumping test october 2003 to january 2005 where hydraulic head in the aquifer varies by 5 m due to river stage variation fig 4c provided the best dataset for evaluation of aquitard properties and hydraulic evidence for secondary pathways across the lower aquitard unit for a few months after the pumping test some piezometers showed lingering effects following depressurization discussed above therefore only data collected after january 2004 are presented here when these effects were largely diminished fig 7 shows hydrographs for piezometers grouped by hydrogeologic unit along with aquifer head for comparison over a one year period fig 8 shows aquifer and transition zone hydrographs over a six month period from june 2004 to january 2005 fig 8a and representative head profiles from manual dpp monitoring fig 8b piezometers in the upper unit 20 m show minimal temporal head variability fig 7a and little change with depth fig 8b the water table in this area is controlled by a nearby canal 30 m which maintains the level at about 5 1 m msl mean sea level for reference ground surface and canal bottom elevations are about 6 7 m and 3 7 m msl respectively the minimal head variability with depth suggests relatively large bulk kv of the upper unit consistent with secondary features associated with its depositional origin such as fractures rootholes and bio disturbances krinitzsky and smith 1969 which greatly enhance kv such that large vertical head differentials cannot exist the dominant general direction of flow in the upper unit must be horizontal because downward flow through the lower unit is restricted a large change in the shape of the head profiles occurs at about 20 m bgs fig 8b indicating a major change in hydrogeologic properties coincident with the interface between the upper backswamp and lower lacustrine units identified by kesel 2008 piezometers in the lacustrine unit show larger but orderly head variation fig 7b with the largest variation closer to the aquifer interface the long term average flow direction appears to be downward across the lower aquitard unit because on average the head just above the top of this unit base of upper aquitard is higher than the average head just below it transition zone and aquifer this causes the relatively steady downward slope in head profiles within the upper part of the lacustrine unit fig 8b while the lower part shows more transience as it responds to the large aquifer head variations another indication of net downward direction of flow across the lower unit is apparent from comparisons of head in the upper unit with the aquifer while pz 60 data fig 7 do not cover a sufficiently long period to establish definitive trends the longer term head in the aquifer over a 10 year period 1995 2005 was estimated using btr records and eq 1 this estimation indicated a time weighted average head of about 4 5 m msl which is about 0 6 m lower than the head in the upper unit fig 7a assuming an 8 m thickness of the lower unit indicates a long term downward hydraulic gradient of about 0 075 which is generally consistent with site estimates based on data from paired piezometers screened in the upper unit and aquifer the largest variations are observed in a thin transition zone between the top of the aquifer and the bottom of the lower aquitard unit which closely tracks the aquifer head fig 7c this zone is designated as a transition zone because the geology is transitional in its textural characteristics and has post depositional influences kesel 2008 describes the transition zone as a red to buff oxidized zone silty clay some sand and organic matter and indicates that sediments of this zone were subjected to subaerial exposure of the river deposited sediment of the aquifer prior to deposition of the lacustrine sediments the aquifer sand and gravel sediments were deposited in the ancestral mississippi river while the sediments that make up the transition zone are mostly clays and silts the apparent larger kv is likely due to effects of fractures caused by subaerial exposure or perhaps interconnected sandy seams with substantial vertical connectivity the elevated kv of the transition zone means that in the context of hydraulic head variations this zone is effectively part of the aquifer therefore the propagation of head variations upward into the lower aquitard unit effectively begins at the top of the transition zone the head differential in the aquifer cycle was about 5 m during the monitoring period but in the middle of the lower aquitard unit the maximum temporal variation was much smaller only about 1 2 m fig 7b none of the piezometers in the lower aquitard unit responded markedly to large cyclical head variation in the aquifer providing no indication of vertical pathways due to secondary permeability features the dampened hydraulic response appears to be governed by low kv and high ss producing low hydraulic diffusivity kv ss of the lacustrine sediment which is examined below 4 3 numerical modeling of aquitard hydraulic response modeling of the hydraulic response data was conducted to evaluate hydraulic properties i e hydraulic diffusivity of the lacustrine unit using 1 d simulations fit to the monitoring data from the lower aquitard unit 2 d simulations were then conducted to evaluate the transient nature of the head profiles across the entire aquitard sequence for stylistic comparison with the field profiles 4 3 1 one dimensional transient flow simulations numerical modeling of lower aquitard unit hydraulic response was performed for the 15 month post pumping test monitoring period during which time large head changes occurred in the underlying aquifer due to river stage variation the transient evolution of head perturbations in the aquifer caused by river stage into the overlying lacustrine unit assuming homogeneous and isotropic conditions with vertical flow governed by intergranular flow with absence of secondary pathways e g fractures or rootholes can be described by the 1 d equation for transient saturated flow 2 2 h z 2 s s k v h t where h hydraulic head z distance into the aquitard ss specific storage and kv vertical hydraulic conductivity hydraulic diffusivity d is defined as kv ss a numerical approach for solution of eq 2 was applied given the variable nature of the hydraulic perturbations which differs from prior studies that used analytical solutions assuming sinusoidal fluctuations e g keller et al 1989 döll and schneider 1995 the approach taken here was to incorporate a finite difference solution in an excel spreadsheet eq 2 can be expressed in finite difference form as 3 h i 1 j 2 h i j h i 1 j δ z 2 s s k h i j 1 h i j δ t where i j designate the node numbers in the spatial and temporal directions respectively and δx and δt designate the discretization letting 4 ρ k s s δ t δ z 2 allows the finite difference equation to be arranged as 5 h i j 1 1 2 ρ h i j ρ h i 1 j h i 1 j which allows the head at a node for the next time step to be calculated from the head at that node and the adjacent two nodes for the preceding time step for stability the value of 1 2ρ must be kept positive to avoid an oscillatory solution therefore ρ 1 2 which is satisfied when 6 δ t s s δ z 2 2 k spatial and temporal discretization must also consider the rate of head change at the boundary and propagation into the aquitard in this case the grid discretization applied was 0 10 m and the time step was 0 05 days tighter spatial and temporal discretization was tested to ensure simulation accuracy along with verification by comparison with simulation results from a finite element numerical model hydrogeosphere therrien and sudicky 1996 http www aquanty com hydrogeosphere the advantage of the numerical solution using excel is that effects of parameter changes are quickly displayed in graphs linked to spreadsheet rows or columns showing how the solution changes in real time as input parameters are modified thus enabling easy comparison with field data fig 9 shows the model domain and boundary conditions for the 1 d simulations the interface between the transition zone and lower aquitard unit was assumed at 28 5 m bgs midway between piezometers at 29 5 m bgs within the transition zone that closely track head in the aquifer and those at 27 4 m that show a delayed and dampened response pz 60 cores fig 2c show the aquifer interface at 32 0 m bgs which translates to an assumed transition zone thickness of 3 5 m clear evidence of a transition zone break was not evident in cores except for observations of lower plasticity and minor oxidation closer to the aquifer also the last shelby tube core from laob 23 from 28 7 to 29 3 m bgs had a higher sand content 30 than shallower cores table 1 for the lower boundary the head in the aquifer from pz 60 or synthetic head estimated from eq 1 when data were not available was applied which closely tracks head in the transition zone from vwp 97b at 29 6 m bgs fig 9b this is the most representative measure of head at the base of the lacustrine unit the upper model boundary at the top of the lower unit was assumed to occur at 20 5 m bgs midway between piezometers at 19 8 m bgs that showed no response fig 7a and those at 21 3 m bgs that responded slowly fig 7b and where the break in behavior occurs in hydraulic head profiles fig 8b thus the lower aquitard unit has an assumed thickness of 8 0 m for simulation purposes a constant head of 5 1 m was applied at the upper boundary consistent with the nearly uniform and steady head in the upper unit fig 7a 8b the graphs in fig 10 compare simulated versus field measured hydraulic head in piezometers within the lower unit at depths of 27 4 25 9 and 24 4 m bgs which represent distances of 1 2 2 7 and 4 2 m respectively from the assumed transition zone interface as shown on the graphs a value for hydraulic diffusivity of d 2 0 10 7 m2 s provides a good fit to the field profiles particularly for piezometers closest to the lower boundary fig 10a a value five times higher d 1 0 10 6 m2 s clearly overestimates the magnitude of response and five times lower d 4 0 10 8 m2 s clearly underestimates the response some of the erratic readings at dpp 85 fig 10b and to a lesser extent at dpp 80a 80b and 80c fig 10c are artifacts of packer issues discussed earlier the earlier data at dpp 85 and dpp 80a 80b and 80c also show remnant effects during recovery from the pumping test depressurization for a few months the poorer quality of the fits with distance upward into the lacustrine unit is likely an artifact of scale and spatial variability in hydraulic parameters the modeling assumes uniform parameters i e kv and ss throughout the lacustrine unit but in reality these parameters vary spatially which is evident from laboratory measurements fig 6b 6c table 1 and textural variation in cores fig 11 shows a comparison of field versus simulated hydraulic head profiles in the lower unit for several snapshots between june 2004 and january 2005 using the best fit hydraulic diffusivity demonstrating reasonable agreement with trends and magnitudes of observed responses applying the geometric mean ss derived from the lab consolidation tests 2 9 10 3 m 1 with the best fit d derived from evaluation of the field data provides a bulk kv of 5 8 10 10 m s which is at the higher end of the range obtained from laboratory tests fig 6 table 1 nearly a factor of 5 higher than the geometric mean from permeameter tests 1 3 10 10 m s but close to the mean from consolidation tests 5 6 10 10 m s these results are consistent with other aquitard studies identifying issues of scale on kv wolff 1970 prudic 1982 herzog and morse 1986 döll and schneider 1995 that generally show larger values from larger scale field hydraulic tests compared to laboratory tests on small core samples while in some cases higher kv in larger scale field measurements versus small scale lab measurements is an indication of fractures or other secondary permeability features in this case the differences are small and attributed to heterogeneity in anisotropy and 3d permeability distribution affecting field measurements in the lacustrine unit if fractures are present in the lacustrine unit they must be either discontinuous non connected fractures and or closed fractures from a hydraulic response perspective in any case the kv of the lacustrine unit derived from field data is still extremely low and consistent with hydraulic responses governed by low intergranular hydraulic conductivity and large storativity of the lacustrine sediments without influence of fractures or other preferential flow paths the average downward groundwater flow velocity v across the lower aquitard unit can be estimated using 7 v q n k v i n where q darcy flux i average hydraulic gradient and n effective porosity applying kv estimated from field data 5 8 10 10 m s a long term average gradient i 0 075 and average porosity n 0 58 gives a groundwater velocity in the lacustrine unit of about 2 mm year this estimated value for the average long term groundwater velocity in the lower unit may appear to be exceptionally small however it is of the same general magnitude obtained for other clayey aquitards of lacustrine origin remenda et al 1996 desaulniers and cherry 1988 parker et al 2004 batlle aguilar et al 2016 at such a low velocity it would take a few thousand years for a water molecule to travel through the 8 m or so thick lower aquitard unit at such low advection diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism for solutes migrating through this unit either upward or downward gillham and cherry 1982 parker et al 2004 4 3 2 two dimensional stylistic transient flow simulations two dimensional transient flow simulations illustrate contrasting conditions for two competing scenarios 1 scenario a with an aquitard with partially penetrating fractures with an underlying unfractured lacustrine zone fig 12 a as evidenced from this study and 2 scenario b with fully penetrating fractures across the lacustrine unit fig 12b these utilized two numerical models fractran sudicky and mclaren 1992 which is a 2 d model for steady state groundwater flow and transient contaminant transport in discretely fractured media and hydrogeosphere therrien and sudicky 1996 brunner and simmons 2012 which is a 3 d model that can accommodate transient flow and transport in variably saturated porous and discretely fractured media fractran was used for generation of the fracture networks and initial steady state flow simulations and then transient flow simulations were conducted using hydrogeosphere which has a built in routine for importing fractran grids and fracture networks scenarios were tailored to site conditions to the extent possible and show the general significance of the contrasting conditions however the fracture networks are hypothetical because the nature of fractures and other pathways in the upper unit was not studied in detail the model domain is cross sectional with a 30 m height consistent with the total aquitard thickness upper and lower units and width of 10 m in scenario a fig 12a fractures do not penetrate the bottom 8 m of the aquitard consistent with the lacustrine unit thickness at the site fractures have variable apertures with a mean of 100 μm in the upper 10 m that was then decreased to 50 μm concurrent with a lower fracture frequency below this depth and finally to no fractures penetrating the bottom 8 m in an alternative scenario b fig 12b fractures are fully penetrating across the lower unit the best fit hydraulic properties kv ss from the 1 d simulations were used for the entire aquitard except in the upper zone where the bulk kv is significantly enhanced by fractures flow boundary conditions consist of a constant head of 5 0 m applied to the top boundary and variable head at the bottom boundary consistent with transient aquifer head same as 1 d simulations the plots in fig 12 show the simulated fracture network and hydraulic head contours for april 2003 along with hydraulic head profiles at x 5 m for several time snapshots at four week intervals between june 2004 and january 2005 same time interval as field profiles in fig 8b and field and 1 d simulation profiles in fig 11 simulated profiles for the scenario with an unfractured lower unit fig 12a are consistent with field profiles fig 8b showing minimal variation throughout the upper fractured unit and significant variation in the lower part of the unfractured zone and even capture the nature of the bow shaped profile in the upper part of the unfractured zone simulated profiles for the alternative scenario with fully penetrating fractures fig 12b show the large hydraulic head variations at the bottom boundary penetrate upward through the entire aquitard thickness and do not match the nature of the field profiles these simulations are considered stylistic as the nature of the fracture distribution in the upper unit was not investigated in detail other than evidence in cores that it is densely fractured hydraulic response in piezometers depends on position relative to discrete fractures for example a piezometer positioned away from a vertical fracture will show a very different response than one intersecting a fracture farah et al 2012 making identification of widely spaced fractures challenging overall these simulations further support the interpretation of site conditions that show an unfractured lower aquitard unit strongly influences hydrogeologic fluxes and hydraulic response to large head changes in the underlying aquifer 5 summary of conclusions detailed hydraulic head profiles though the 30 m thick surficial aquitard at the study site show two distinct hydrogeologic units an upper unit with minimal head variation with depth and over time with the head constrained by the shallow drainage works and a lower unit that has larger but slow head variations due to the cyclical rise and fall of the mississippi river stage which is directly connected to the underlying aquifer the upper unit is comprised of interlayered backswamp and overbank deposits and flow is dominated by secondary permeability due to fractures and rootholes and other features caused by plant growth organisms and weathering in contrast the lower unit of lacustrine origin shows no evidence of secondary permeability modeling the hydraulic response of the lower unit to large head changes in the underlying aquifer provided a best fit hydraulic diffusivity kv ss and kv within but near the upper end of the range of values obtained from laboratory tests on core samples while there are minor uncertainties associated with the field scale values mostly related to the selection of the exact position of the bottom of the aquitard and influence of 3 d heterogeneity in the lacustrine unit related to small scale lens like stratification of the clay silt and fine sand components results show the hydraulic response in the lacustrine portion of the aquitard is governed by its very low intergranular k and large storativity consistent with lack of fractures or other preferential pathways although widely spaced discontinuities such as fractures or other higher k features across the lower aquitard unit cannot be ruled out definitely none of the high resolution field data and multiple lines of evidence collected to rigorously test this suggests this possibility if fractures do exist in the lacustrine unit they must either be discontinuous non connected fractures and or closed fractures at the study site scale this finding is consistent with geologic origin and geotechnical properties kesel 2008 indicates lacustrine origin with the largest sediment deposition rates for this part of the aquitard and geotechnical studies indicate that this clayey sediment is normally consolidated and very plastic the finding that the holocene age lacustrine aquitard unit has very low kv with no evidence of secondary permeability features providing excellent protection of the underlying aquifers from surficial contamination sources has relevance to other parts of the mississippi river valley where lacustrine deposits overlain by backswamp deposits are known to occur this is in contrast to existing reports on other aquitard types in louisiana that are pleistocene age where significant control of groundwater flow by secondary permeability features has been observed the general approach used in this study taking advantage of natural head perturbations in an adjacent aquifer unit in this case due to river connection with significant stage variation combined with temporal depth discrete monitoring in the aquitard has merits for application to any similar surficial clayey aquitard acknowledgements the field data for

7469,the transport of water and vapour in the desert vadose zone plays a critical role in the overall water and energy balances of near surface environments in arid regions however field measurements in extremely dry environments face many difficulties and challenges so few studies have examined water and vapour transport processes in the desert vadose zone the main objective of this study is to analyse the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone depth of 350 cm by using measured and modelled data in an extremely arid environment the field experiments are implemented in an area of the gobi desert in northwestern china to measure the soil properties daily soil moisture and temperature daily water table depth and temperature and daily meteorological records from doys days of year 114 212 in 2014 growing season the hydrus 1d model which simulates the coupled transport of water vapour and heat in the vadose zone is employed to simulate the layered soil moisture and temperature regimes and analyse the transport processes of soil water and vapour the measured results show that the soil water and temperatures near the land surface have visible daily fluctuations across the entire soil profile thermal vapour movement is the most important component of the total water flux and the soil temperature gradient is the major driving factor that affects vapour transport in the desert vadose zone the most active water and heat exchange occurs in the upper soil layer depths of 0 25 cm the matric potential change from the precipitation mainly re draws the spatio temporal distribution of the isothermal liquid water in the soil near the land surface the matric potential has little effect on the isothermal vapour and thermal liquid water flux these findings offer new insights into the liquid water and vapour movement processes in the extremely arid environment keywords transport mechanism soil temperature and matric potential liquid water and vapour field experiments and simulations desert vadose zone 1 introduction the vadose zone links rainfall surface water groundwater and soil water and facilitates the exchange and allocation of the water and energy in the hydrological cycle of earth s land surface system pfletschinger et al 2014 moradi et al 2016 in arid regions where the soil water content is very low vapour movement is a particularly important component of the total water flux in the vadose zone milly 1984 saito et al 2006 zeng et al 2009a b huang et al 2016 hou et al 2016 therefore investigating the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport is critical to understanding the water and energy balances of arid regions for agricultural and ecological applications soil moisture especially near the soil surface is influenced by evaporation precipitation and other vadose zone properties soil drying is the process through which liquid water and vapour water in the vadose zone are transferred into the atmosphere via heat conduction rutten et al 2010 this process is generally separated into three distinct stages during stage one with a relatively high and stable rate soil evaporation is the maximum or potential rate of drying that occurs when the soil surface is at or near saturation and is determined by climatic conditions salvucci 1997 wilson et al 2011 during stage two with a falling rate the hydraulic conductivity of the soil controls the evaporation because the soil moisture gradually becomes scarce and no longer permits a sufficient flow to maintain the potential evaporative rate boulet et al 1997 or et al 2013 kool et al 2014 during stage three with a low and stable rate the soil moisture reaches a slow residual value so the weak and stable vapour diffusion becomes the major process of migrating to the surface tarnawski and leong 2000 wilson et al 2011 in arid regions the soil moisture approaches the soil residual water content reducing the soil hydraulic conductivity and increasing the vapour content consequently vapour movement becomes the major component of the water movement in dry soils saito et al 2006 zeng et al 2011a b the quantitative study of soil water movement began at the beginning of 1900s russell 1909 the capillary potential was expounded by buckingham 1904 and was gradually introduced to quantitatively describe soil water movement philip 1957 on the basis of the concept of capillary potential the channels in soils might be generalized as bundles of capillary tubes that control the rate of the flow of water and air through soils green and ampt 1911 richards 1931 presented a continuous flow equation of variably saturated soil hereafter the richards equation according to the gradient of soil water potential with all its components zha et al 2016 after that studying soil water movement stepped into modelling times philip and de vries 1957 provided a mathematical model of liquid water and vapour transport through soils based on the richards equation that was driven by both the pressure head isothermal and soil temperature gradients thermal hereafter the pdv model since then the pdv model has been the theoretical basis for studying the interactions among liquid water vapour and heat transports in unsaturated soils milly 1982 modified the pdv model by using the matric potential gradient instead of the soil water content gradient to investigate the mechanism of water and vapour transports in heterogeneous soils the pdv model was also later extended by nassar and horton 1989 who considered the effect of an osmotic potential gradient on the coupled transport of water solutes and heat in the vadose zone however cahill and parlange 1998 found that the soil water and vapour fluxes that were estimated by the mass and energy conservation equation were higher than and opposite those in the pdv model most of the above models were developed according to some assumptions e g a representative elementary volume and laboratory experiments while field experiments completely lacked any support for these assumptions smits et al 2011 min et al 2015 wang et al 2011 found that the soil temperature gradient significant strengthened the soil water movement when the temperature difference between the land surface and the phreatic water was greater than 10 c according to the long term observations of soil water movements saito et al 2006 developed a numerical model of coupled liquid water vapour and heat transport in the soil that included the surface water and energy balance from field experiment data zeng et al 2011a b considered the effect of the dry soil airflow on the convection of vapour by using a new model of the coupled water vapour and heat of the soil however mohanty and yang 2013 commented that zeng et al s model overestimated the influence of the soil airflow on the isothermal vapour hydraulic conductivities zeng and su 2013 thought that such claim was not systemic and the total vapour flux consists of isothermal thermal fluxes and convective fluxes and these three types of fluxes were relevant and were driven by the air pressure gradient in addition gao and shao 2015 confirmed that the soil temperature could affect soil water and vapour transport by influencing the soil texture water viscosity hydraulic conductivity vapour diffusion rate heat capacity etc although both liquid water and vapour transport are widely recognized to be closely related the mechanism of soil water and vapour transfer is complicated and requires further study in arid or semiarid regions the vapour movement in the dry vadose zone becomes very important because the soil moisture is very low such vapour transport in the dry soils occurs stage three of the soil drying process defined in this paper although this vapour transfer is low and stable the water that is lost to the atmosphere cannot be ignored because of the large areas of the global arid and semiarid regions tang and riley 2013 yuan et al 2015 therefore vapour transport in the dry vadose zone can considerably influence the regional water and energy balances and climate change in arid or semiarid regions many studies have investigated soil liquid water and vapour transport within the soil column in the laboratory gierke et al 1992 pfletschinger et al 2012 hernández lópez et al 2014 however the soil atmosphere interface is an important boundary condition that affects the subsurface movements of liquid water vapour and heat in the field especially for dry soils direct measurements of all the components that affect the water and energy balances at the soil surface over short time intervals are rarely available additionally few studies have examined the mechanisms of water and vapour transport in the vadose zone in an arid desert environment as observed in the field zeng et al 2009a b hou et al 2016 in extremely arid regions local precipitation is particularly rare very little runoff is generated so the movement of vapour from the vadose zone into the atmosphere influences the regional water and energy balances and the ecological water flow schedule and management investigating the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport is a direct approach to address the above issues in this study the ejina delta which is located within and desert environment was chosen as the study area this delta is located in the lower reaches of the heihe river basin which is the second largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwestern china systematic measurements of the soil moisture soil temperature groundwater and micrometeorological variables were recorded the hydrus 1d model which is a coupled liquid water vapour and heat transfer model was applied in the study area the objectives of this study are to 1 describe the daily patterns of the soil water and temperature regimes 2 quantify the main variables of this system soil temperature and soil matric potential and 3 analyse the effects of the soil temperature and matric potential gradients and precipitation on the liquid and vapour transports in the desert vadose zone 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the eijina delta 11 000 km2 is located in the lower reaches of the heihe river basin in the arid region of northwestern china figs 1 and 2 the climatic conditions of the study area are extremely arid and are characterized by very hot summers very cold winters sparse precipitation large evaporation capacity adequate sunshine and strong sandstorms according to climate data from the ejina weather station fig 1 during 1961 2015 the mean annual air temperature was 9 1 c with a lowest monthly average temperature of 11 2 c in january and a highest monthly average temperature of 27 1 c in july the mean annual precipitation was 35 2 mm with a maximum of 101 1 mm in 1969 and a minimum of 7 0 mm in 1983 and the annual precipitation was seasonally distributed with approximately 75 of the annual precipitation falling during june september wang et al 2014a the potential evaporation in the study area was very high approximately 1444 mm during the period of the data and was 40 times the mean annual precipitation du et al 2016 in the study area the river system which originates from the heihe river and is divided into two intermittent rivers the east and west rivers after the hydrological station flows through the extensive gobi desert ending at its terminal lakes east and west juyan lakes fig 1 the river system is the primary water source for the riparian vegetation and the shallow groundwater min et al 2013 wang et al 2014b has allowed a natural oasis to form in the gobi desert wang et al 2013 approximately 72 of the delta consists of gobi desert zhang et al 2011 the gobi desert surface is covered with scattered black gravel which is a unique protective layer in this gobi desert and can significantly affect the energy exchange at the surface the remaining 28 of the delta consists of two desert vegetation zones which are densely distributed along the riparian and scattered throughout the gobi desert zhang et al 2011 according to the groundwater table gwt the elevation of the groundwater table data from the observational wells the average water table depth is approximately 3 0 m across the delta this depth varies between 2 0 and 8 5 m from the south to the north of the delta wang et al 2014b 2 2 experimental site 2 2 1 instruments and observations observational system of the desert vadose zone requires aboveground and belowground components fig 2 the aboveground observational instrument was a micro weather station this station monitored the precipitation air temperature air pressure relative humidity and wind speed and direction the daily changes in these atmospheric conditions are shown in fig 3 a e the gwt depth and temperature are the underground factors that were monitored the gwt depth was obtained with a correction of the pressure head and the local barometric pressure the pressure head was monitored with a schlumberger mini diver pressure transducer that was located at an approximate depth of 8 7 m the mini diver had a pressure range of 10 m with a resolution of 2 mm and an accuracy of 5 mm the barometric pressure correction was taken from the micro weather station the groundwater temperature was simultaneously recorded by the transducer with a range from 20 c to 80 c a resolution of 0 01 c and an accuracy of 0 1 c fig 3f shows the corrected gwt depth and temperature at the experimental site from 24 april to 31 july 2014 six soil moisture probes fds 100 sensor that monitored the soil water contents and temperatures were installed at the following depths 20 150 210 265 300 and 320 cm fig 2c the soil texture directly affects the actual performance of the soil moisture sensor in different types of soils so the raw data from the sensor had to be calibrated by the actual transformation parameters for different soil textures the fds 100 sensor derived the volumetric soil moisture θ values from the soil dielectric capacity by using the following equation gao et al 2006 1 θ a v b where θ is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 v is the output voltage of the probe v and a and b are the transformation parameters with default values of 0 00571 and 225 2 respectively the θ and v values for calibration were obtained by measuring the voltage of the probe in dry to saturated soil samples during the laboratory experiments at the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences the calibrated soil water contents strongly matched the measured values at the experimental site 2 2 2 measurement data fig 3a e show the meteorological conditions during the experimental period from 24 april to 31 july 2014 the atmospheric pressure regularly varied between 88 5 and 90 7 kpa with a daily mean of 89 4 kpa the air temperature had a significantly increasing trend and varied from 4 8 to 32 6 c with a daily average of 23 4 c the surface temperature had similar variations with a daily average of 28 1 c the daily air relative humidity values fluctuated between 6 and 71 the daily variations in the wind speeds were very strong with a maximum of 7 6 m s 1 and a daily average of approximately 3 2 m s 1 the precipitation before 28 june 2014 was almost zero but the precipitation during 28 june and 31 july 2014 was approximately 63 2 mm comprising almost all the precipitation of this year the evaporation was larger with a mean of 3 0 mm d 1 during the experimental period the gwt observations are shown in fig 3 f during doys 114 and 191 namely from 24 april to 10 july the gwt fluctuations were stable with daily depths between 363 1 and 366 0 cm and an average of 364 9 cm in the study area the groundwater dynamic was mainly affected by the river flow regime of the east and west river channels the river flowed during june and july and the rivers were recharged by the scheduled streamflow from the upstream area of the heihe river basin therefore the gwt rapidly increased following doy 192 11 july and the minimum depth the maximum water table reached 358 cm on doy 200 as shown in fig 3b the groundwater temperature increased at an exponential rate during the experimental period at the end of april and the beginning of may the groundwater temperature was lower and almost constant with a daily mean of 12 c after doy 127 the groundwater temperature began to gradually rise from 12 c to 13 3 c 2 2 3 soil properties the soil profile was approximately 350 cm thick soil samples were collected from each of the soil layers at intervals of 50 cm along the profile to analyse the soil properties three repeated samples were excavated for every layer soil to ensure sample reliability these samples were taken to the laboratory to measure the soil particle size distribution soil bulk density and hydraulic conductivity laboratory analyses of the soil particle sizes were performed according to the soil classification system of the united states department of agriculture usda by using the vibration sieve method 0 05 mm and laser particle size analysis 0 05 mm the soil bulk density was measured by using the excavation method grossman and reinsch 2002 undisturbed soil samples were extracted by using sealed ring containers φ50 46 50 mm 100 cm3 the gravimetric and volumetric bulk densities were estimated by weighing the dry soil weights and volume the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity was measured by using a saturated permeability tester with a fixed water head method bs stxs11 1 the soil water retention curves of all the samples were obtained by using a hitachi cr21giii centrifuge the above soil experiments were completed in the laboratory of soil water processes of the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences the measured physical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 the bulk densities from the top to the bottom of the soil profiles were approximately 1 57 g cm 3 similarly all the soil samples consisted of nearly 100 sand the estimated hydraulic conductivities of the soil varied from 1250 to 1450 cm d 1 along the soil profile the soil hydraulic parameters in table 2 were obtained by a simultaneous fitting of soil water retention data with the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 table 1 showed the nse of the measured and the fitted soil water retention curves for each soil layers and the nse values were more than 0 80 which illustrated that the parameters estimated by van genuchten equation were reliable tables 1 and 2 were input into the following numerical model as the soil hydraulic parameters 2 3 numerical modelling liquid water and gaseous water vapour are two phases of soil water soil water movement includes both liquid water and vapour movement in dry soils the vapour flux is the rate of vapour movement in the soil and the total water flux is the combined rate of liquid water and vapour movement in the soil the direction of soil water movement may be upward or downward if the vapour transfer in the soil is upward from the soil surface into the atmosphere the upward vapour flux is soil evaporation the hydrus 1d model has often been used to simulate continuous changes in the water content temperature and fluxes of bare field soils huang et al 2016 therefore this study employed a hydrus 1d model that was modified by saito et al 2006 to simulate the transfer water and vapour in a desert vadose zone 2 3 1 model description the governing equation for the one dimensional vertical flow of liquid water and vapour in the vadose zone is described by the following mass conservation equation saito et al 2006 2 θ t q l z q v z s where θ is the total liquid water and water vapour content cm3 cm 3 t is the time d ql and qv are the flux rates of liquid water and vapour cm d 1 respectively z is the vertical axis which is positive upward cm and s is a general sink or source term d 1 which primarily include the root water uptake the precipitation soil evaporation infiltration bottom drainage capillary rise from groundwater table etc are generally considered as boundary conditions and not as the source or sink terms of the soil water flow equation in this study s is zero because no roots are present in the desert vadose zone the flux rate of liquid water ql is described as follows philip and de vries 1957 3 q l q lh q lt k lh h z 1 k lt t z where qlh and qlt are the isothermal and thermal liquid water flux rates cm d 1 respectively and klh cm d 1 and klt cm2 c 1 d 1 are the hydraulic conductivities of liquid water in soils from the gradients of the pressure head h cm and temperature t c respectively if we assume that the relative humidity in the soil pores remains constant with changes in temperature philip and de vries 1957 the vapour flux rate qv can also be separated into two components as follows 4 q v q vh q vt k vh h z k vt t z where qvh and qvt are the isothermal and thermal vapour flux rates cm d 1 respectively and kvh cm d 1 and kvt cm2 c 1 d 1 are the corresponding vapour hydraulic conductivities respectively if eqs 3 and 4 are brought into eq 2 the governing equation of liquid water and vapour flow can be written as follows 5 θ t z k hh h z k tt t z k lh 6 k hh k lh k vh 7 k tt k lt k vt where khh cm d 1 and ktt cm2 c 1 d 1 are the total isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities respectively therefore the vapour flux is the sum of the isothermal and thermal vapour flux and the total water flux includes the isothermal and thermal liquid water flux and the vapour flux 2 3 2 soil hydraulic parameters we chose to use the mualem van genuchten model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 to describe the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity function the isothermal hydraulic conductivity klh was estimated by using the pore size distribution model of mualem 1976 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity 8 k lh k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 se is the effective saturation and l and m are empirical parameters the parameter l was assigned a value of 0 5 as suggested by mualem 1976 and the value of m 1 1 n was determined by fitting van genuchten s analytical model to the water retention data with the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 van genuchten s analytical model is as follows 9 θ l θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 where θl is the liquid water content cm3 cm 3 θr and θs are the saturated and residual water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively and α cm 1 and n are empirical shape parameters which can be obtained by fitting the measured water retention curve data the thermal hydraulic conductivity klt is defined as follows noborio et al 1996 saito et al 2006 10 k lt k lh hg wt 1 γ 0 d γ dt where gwt is the gain factor which quantifies the temperature dependence of the

cm in depth a spatial discretization of 1 cm was used creating 381 nodes across the profile the nodes at 20 cm 150 cm 210 cm 265 cm 300 cm and 320 cm were selected to compare the calculated soil water contents and temperature with the measured values fig 3g and h the calculations were performed for a period of 99 days from 24 april to 31 july in 2014 the temporal discretization varied between a minimum and maximum time step and was controlled by a time step criterion running the program required specifying the initial conditions for the soil water content and temperature of the entire profile which were determined by interpolating the measured values from the observed depths on 24 april 2014 2 3 3 2 boundary conditions the study area is located in an extremely arid region so no ponding or surface runoff was considered thus the moisture flux out of the soil equalled to the evaporation minus the precipitation 18 q l z 0 e p where e is the evaporation rate cm d 1 and p is the precipitation rate cm d 1 surface evaporation is controlled by the atmospheric conditions surface moisture and moisture transport in the soil so the evaporation when considering all these factors is

soil water is at or near saturation the evaporation equals the potential evaporation however the evaporation is determined by the actual soil water according to eq 19 the hydrus 1d model can calculate the potential evaporation by using food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommended penman monteith combination equation allen et al 1998 and the meteorological data fig 3a e and further determine actual evaporation based on the availability of water in the soil profile and potential evaporation the groundwater level was the bottom boundary condition and was chosen according to the field monitoring results fig 3f the upper and lower boundary conditions for the heat transport were determined by the measured surface temperature and groundwater temperature 3 results 3 1 modelling results in this section the simulated soil water content and soil temperatures are compared to the measured values to describe the accuracy of the modelling results this study employed an indicator specifically the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse to evaluate the differences between the measured and simulated values the nse has been commonly used to assess the predictive power of hydrological discharge models this value is defined as follows nash and sutcliffe 1970 22 nse 1 t 1 n x o t x m t 2 t 1 n x o t x o 2 where x o t and x m t are the observed and modelled values at time t respectively x o is the mean of the observed values and n is the number of time samples the nse can range from to 1 an efficiency of 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the model and observations an efficiency of 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency of less than zero nse 0 occurs when the observed mean is a better predictor than the model this method has also been used to quantitatively assess the accuracy of other types of models such as sediment temperature and concentration models moriasi et al 2007 3 1 1 soil water contents the soil water contents of the profile were calculated by using the hydrus 1d model fig 4 depicted the simulated and measured soil water contents at depths of 20 cm 150 cm 210 cm 265 cm 300 cm and 320 cm the nses of the soil water contents at the measured depths were 0 972 0 959 0 958 0 900 0 901 and 0 994 respectively table 3 overall the simulated soil water contents at different depths agreed well with the measured data fig 4 shows different regimes for the soil water contents from the top to the bottom of the soil profile over the entire soil profile the soil water contents above a depth of 250 cm were low and their variations were between 1 5 and 5 however the soil water contents below this depth were greater with a variation range of 6 17 at a depth of 20 cm the model could capture the visible changes in the soil water content near the surface that were caused by precipitation during doys 114 and 179 which experienced no rainfall the soil water content was very low and remained stable with a daily mean variation of approximately 1 3 fig 5 according to fig 3e a relatively concentrated precipitation event occurred after doy 180 correspondingly the soil water content significantly increased from 1 3 to 4 8 because of the infiltration of the precipitation the soil water contents of the soil layers at the depths of 150 cm and 210 cm continued to linearly increase from 1 7 to 2 3 during the experiment the soil layers at depths of 150 cm and 210 cm were far from the surface and groundwater table the hydraulic conductivity of these soil layers was lower effects of the infiltration of water due to the precipitation and capillary rise from groundwater on soil water were both very weak therefore the soil water contents at depths of 150 and 210 cm were directly affected by the soil water regime of the adjacent soil layers similar soil water content regimes were present at depths of 265 cm 300 cm and 320 cm these layers remained almost constant during doys 114 and 191 but their soil water contents significantly increased after doy 192 during the experimental period the measured soil water content at a depth of 265 cm was between 10 4 and 16 8 with a daily average of 11 6 the measured values at a depth of 300 cm varied from 7 6 to 12 6 with a mean of 8 6 the measured soil moisture at 320 cm was between 6 7 and 13 3 with a mean of 7 8 as shown in figs 3f and 4 the soil moisture gradually decreased along the soil profile from 265 cm to 320 cm when the gwt was low and stable however the soil moisture increased when the gwt increased and recharged the soil near the water table via soil capillarity with this increase being greater with increasing depth moreover fig 4 shows that the model did not reflect the sudden changes in soil moisture at depths from 250 cm to 300 cm the soils between 265 cm and 300 cm depths contained some large grain gravel φ 2 cm this gravel could not be described by the current soil classification system of the united states department of agriculture usda in hydrus 1d model the hydraulic parameters were determined by rosetta model an inverse model for the water flow parameter based on the above soil particle distribution not include gravel however these parameters could not truly reflect the soil properties and water flow behaviors due to the rough or incomplete soil classification system in addition the inherent assumptions of the model e g the equilibrium inter phase mass exchange also impacted the capture of the coupled processes between solid liquid and vapour three phases which required further tests and sensitivity analyses using the direct experimental observations in the future works 3 1 2 soil temperatures in this study the soil temperature simulations needed to determine the heat transport parameters of the hydrud 1d the heat transport parameters of for layered soils mainly referred to the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the solid phase and liquid phase the volumetric heat capacity of the liquid phase was a given constant 4 2 103 j kg 1 c the volumetric heat capacity of the soil phase could be determined by physical measurements but the measurement method consumed both time and effort the measured values were not highly accurate and only a reference for model calibration in addition the thermal conductivity in this study was determined by the following equation chung and horton 1987 23 λ 0 θ b 1 b 2 θ b 3 θ 0 5 where b 1 b 2 and b 3 are empirical parameters which are generally obtained by the model calibration rather than by physical measurements therefore during the simulation of soil temperatures the heat transport parameters were obtained by model calibration for different soil layers fig 5 shows the simulated and measured soil temperatures at 20 cm 150 cm 210 cm 265 cm 300 cm and 320 cm the nses of the soil temperatures were 0 969 0 982 0 975 0 961 0 979 and 0 974 respectively this result showed that the model could simulate the soil temperature dynamics the soil temperatures at every layer gradually increased with time during the experimental period but the soil temperatures along the profile decreased with increasing depth among the measured layers the soil temperatures at 20 cm the upper layer were the highest and had significant fluctuations the variations in soil temperature were dominated by the ground surface s energy balance i e as reflected by the surface temperature however the soil temperature changes below 150 cm were smooth with minimal variations and resembled the groundwater temperature changes 3 2 effect of soil temperature on water and vapour transfer 3 2 1 soil temperature and temperature gradient fields the soil temperature regime is an indicator of changes in soil heat we must study the temperature field of the dester vadose zone to understand the variations and mechanisms of soil heat a contour map of the soil temperatures with intervals of 2 c shows the daily variations in the soil temperature profiles from doys 114 to 212 fig 6 a as shown in fig 6a the density of the contours decreased with increasing depth during the experimental period the soil temperatures changed from 6 0 c to 29 6 c at the top layer of the soil profile and from 10 1 c to 15 6 c at the bottom layer the temperature gradient of the entire profile was approximately 0 04 c cm 1 however the temperature profile was not uniformly distributed across the column the influencing depth and range of the soil temperature gradually increased as the surface temperature increased throughout the experimental period the maximum temperature of the entire profile occurred at approximately 20 50 cm depth and its location was gradually moving down with time and was not fixed at the depth of 20 cm where the sensor was located the temperature contours were dense at depths of 0 100 cm and became sparse below 100 cm additionally the variations in the soil temperature decreased with increasing depth the soil temperatures in the top layers varied considerably while those in the lower layers varied only slightly the information from the contours below 350 cm is not shown in fig 6a because almost no variations in the soil temperature occurred below this depth it should be aware that there was a wide depth interval between depths from 20 to 150 cm this was mainly due to consider the uneven distributions of soil moisture profile the soil moistures of the upper layers above the depth of 200 cm were relatively dry and had no significant changes along the profile but the soil moistures of the lower layers below 200 cm depth became greater and significantly varied along the profile in order to capture the variation of soil moisture along the profile the probes were installed according to the soil moisture profile because the upper soil was very dry the heat transfer of the upper soil was mainly affected by the soil texture solid medium and the impact of soil moisture on heat conduction could be negligible heat transport parameters of the solid medium of all layers were almost same due to the relatively uniform soil texture along the entire profile the measured soil temperatures at depths of 20 and 150 cm could control variations of the soil temperature profile and capture the characteristics of the thermal profile however the soil moisture of the lower layers varied greatly and the liquid water affected the heat transfer if the observation density of soil temperatures near the bottom were not added the sparse observations could leave some uncertainty on the characteristics of the thermal profile and its evolution as time progresses the contours of the profile became denser and gradually moved downwards along the profile thus the soil temperature of the entire profile increased and varied considerably before doy 160 temperatures were lower across the profile and any variations were weak however these characteristics reversed after doy 160 fig 6b depicts the spatio temporal temperature gradient field and clearly shows how the heat transport in the soil controlled the spatio temporal dependences of the temperature gradient profiles the variations in the contours of the temperature gradient in fig 6b matched those in fig 6a the density of the contours became sparse with increasing depth indicating that the effects of soil temperature on soil water movement become gradually weaker according to the temperature gradient profiles the contours at depths of 0 25 cm were very dense between depths of 0 cm and 25 cm the temperature gradient was negative and the mean value and maximum gradient were 0 21 c cm 1 and 0 8 c cm 1 respectively thus 0 25 cm was the most active layer for heat exchange however the gradient was 0 c cm 1 at approximately 25 cm the gradient below 25 cm was positive the gradient values decreased and the contours became sparse with increasing depth another zero gradient line occurred at 280 cm depth thus these two depths were defined as the zero heat flux planes two types of zero heat flux planes occurred one was a divergent plane with the temperature gradients above and below this plane being positive and negative upwards and downwards respectively and the other was a convergent plane with the opposite gradient directions from those of the divergent plane the upper zero heat flux plane was a divergent plane throughout the study period the soil water moved to the surface above this plane and was transported downward below this plane however the lower zero heat flux plane was a convergent plane the soil water moved downward above this plane and upward below this plane the zero heat flux plane could be regarded as a critical point at which the direction of the temperature gradient was reversed 3 2 2 thermal flux from the soil temperature according to eqs 3 and 4 the thermal liquid water qlt and vapour qvt fluxes were affected by the soil temperature fig 7 c and d show the spatio temporal distributions of the thermal liquid and vapour fluxes from the hydrus 1d model following the definitions of divergent and convergent planes in fig 6b thermal fluxes occurred in the upper convergent plane in fig 6c and d the thermal fluxes below the lower zero flux plane are almost zero this plane is neither divergent nor convergent fig 6c shows two zero thermal liquid flux planes which correspond to the zero heat flux planes during the simulation period the upper thermal liquid zero flux plane was at approximately 25 cm and was a divergent plane i e above this plane the flux was upward and positive during the period with no precipitation doys 114 179 the thermal liquid flux contour lines were sparse showing that the liquid flux from the temperature was weak however at the start of the period with precipitation doys 180 212 the thermal liquid water flux contour lines rapidly became denser and the flux magnitude increased considerably rising to 0 4 mm d 1 by the end of the experimental period the lower zero thermal liquid flux plane was approximately 250 cm deep and was a convergent plane below this plane the flux from the temperature gradient was positive upward and very weak near the saturated soil layer between the two zero thermal liquid flux planes the contours were sparse and non uniform and the negative downward flux was very low the spatio temporal distribution of the thermal vapour flux field is shown in fig 6d and was found to be similar to the distribution of the thermal liquid water flux two different zero vapour flux planes were present above the upper plane depth of 25 cm the thermal vapour water flux was still strong and rose to 0 14 mm d 1 therefore acting as the main contributor to the total water flux of the desert vadose zone between the two planes the contours were sparse and the thermal vapour flux was weak and downwards similarly the vapour flux below the lower zero flux plane was very weak because of the near saturation of the soil fig 7 depicts the distributions of the thermal liquid and vapour fluxes along the profile on doy 125 with no precipitation and doy 200 with precipitation fig 7a shows that the thermal liquid water flux of the soil profile in the desert vadose zone profile was almost zero in the absence of precipitation the soil was very dry and the liquid water in the soil pores lost its capillary connection so the soil temperature gradients had little effect on the transport of liquid water although the soil water content was very low the vapour water became the major component of the soil water in the desert vadose zone the soil temperature gradients could form a strong driving force to increase the transport of vapour water fig 7b depicts the vapour flux rate of the soil profile from soil temperature gradient fig 6b shows a stronger temperature gradient in the upper layers depths of approximately 0 100 cm correspondingly the thermal vapour fluxes of the upper layers were very high the value in the surface reached 0 1 mm d 1 however the temperature gradient rapidly decreased with increasing depth as did the thermal vapour flux when precipitation occurred on the surface the soil water content in the surface soil increased and the upward soil temperature gradient caused the liquid water to move upward precipitation only recharge the soil water within the upper layer because of the small amount of precipitation less than 6 mm d 1 with the recharge depths being approximately 30 cm fig 7c as shown in fig 7b and c the thermal vapour flux in the desert vadose zone after being recharged by precipitation was much lower than that without precipitation recharge thus precipitation could reduce or prevent the transfer of thermal vapour 3 3 effect of the matric potential on water and vapour transfer 3 3 1 soil matric potential and its gradients fields the soil water potential describes the influence of the flow of water in liquid and vapour phases in the vadose zone soil water moves from regions with high potential to regions with low potential jury and horton 2004 in this study the soil water potential consisted of the gravitational component of the water potential and matric potential the gravitational component of the water potential equalled the elevation above positive or below negative a reference datum the ground surface was used as this reference datum so the gravitational component of the water potential was negative the matric component of the soil water potential represents the influence of the adsorption and capillarity in the retention of water in the pore walls the desert soil in our study was very dry and the matric potential was therefore difficult to directly monitor so the soil moisture was measured and transformed into the matric potential by using the soil water retention curve the daily variations in the matric potential profiles are shown in fig 8 a the contours changed from dense to sparse with increasing depth thus the matric potential varied strongly in the upper layer but changed more slowly toward the lower layers the matric potential fluctuated from 6000 cm to 200 cm at the surface and varied from 30 cm to 10 cm at the bottom of the profile consequently the variations in the soil matric potential were very large the matric potential near the surface was the lowest becoming larger only with increasing depth which indicates that the gradient of the matric component of the soil water potential induced the upward flow of water in liquid and vapour phases during the measurement period fig 8b shows the spatio temporal variations in the matric potential gradients in the desert vadose zone the contours were not depicted uniformly because of the large differences in the matric potential gradients along the profile in fig 8b the patterns of the gradient were similar to the pattern of the matric potential four gradient centres were present over the spatio temporal field the first gradient centre was the low value centre which occurred at a depth between 0 cm and 10 cm the contours near the surface were the most intense therefore the gradient fluctuations were strongest near the surface the other three gradient centres had high values two gradient centres with high values matric potential 10 200 cm occurred at depths between 10 cm and 100 cm during doys 144 and 212 these results were caused by precipitation the soil water line moved downward because of the infiltration of the precipitation two zero gradient lines separated the matric gradient field into three regions as shown in fig 8b the gradients were mostly negative and tended to be larger with increasing depth 3 3 2 the isothermal flux from the soil matric potential saito et al 2006 deduced the effect of the matric potential on the isothermal liquid water qlh and vapour qvh fluxes according to pdv theory philip and de vries 1957 as determined by eqs 3 and 4 respectively fig 8c shows the variations in the isothermal liquid water flux the flux profile clearly shows how the gradient matric component of soil water potential induces the liquid water movement in space and time the pattern of the isothermal liquid water flux was similar to that of the matric potential gradients an unclosed zero flux plane occurred above 125 cm which was convergent and separated the entire profile into two different fields during the experimental period the isothermal liquid water flux pointed upwards below the zero flux plane and its mean value was approximately 0 01 mm d 1 however the isothermal liquid water flux in the upper layers pointed downward and was very strong up to 2 3 mm d 1 because of the effect of precipitation the variations in the isothermal vapour flux are shown in fig 8d the flux profile clearly shows that the matric potential had an effect on the vapour transfer in the desert vadose zone the flux fluctuation was strong in the top layer depth of approximately 10 cm the isothermal vapour flux varied from 3 8 10 6 mm d 1 to 0 006 mm d 1 at the land surface and from 4 3 10 5 mm d 1 to 2 8 10 5 mm d 1 at a depth of 5 cm almost no fluctuations occurred in the deeper layers for example the maximum and minimum fluxes at the depth of 340 cm were 2 6 10 9 mm d 1 and 4 9 10 14 mm d 1 respectively although the isothermal vapour flux was weak the direction of the flux was upward across the entire profile during the experimental period fig 9 depicts the distributions of the isothermal liquid water and vapour fluxes along the profile on doy 125 with no precipitation and doy 200 with precipitation as an example of the transport processes of the fluxes compared the liquid water flux fig 9a and c and the vapour flux fig 9a and d the matric potential had a significant effect on the liquid water transfer and almost no effect on the vapour transfer along the profile fig 9a shows that the liquid water fluxes at the upper and lower layers were upward and very weak in the absence of precipitation the matric potential gradients of the upper layers were very large and the soil water contents were very low so the capillary connections of soil pore were considerably weak as was the liquid water flux additionally the soil water contents of the lower layers were relative high but their matric potential gradients were very small and had weak effects on the liquid water transport upward however the soil water contents fig 4 and the matric potential gradients fig 8b of the middle layers on doy 125 were relatively higher so the matric potential gradients could form a stronger driving force to cause liquid water to move upward fig 9a in addition the infiltration of water due to the precipitation increased the soil water content which in turn affected the distribution of the soil matric potential profile fig 9c shows that the downward matric potential gradients significantly forced liquid water downward 4 discussions 4 1 mechanisms of the soil moisture variations in the layers at 150 and 210 cm the soil layer from 150 cm to 210 cm depth was far from the surface and groundwater table soil water contents at depths of 150 and 210 cm were directly affected by the soil water regimes of the adjacent soil layers figs 7 and 9 showed the liquid water vapour fluxes of the desert vadose zone with no precipitation and precipitation respectively and explained the mechanism of the soil moisture variations in the two layers figs 7a and b and 9b showed that for the case of no precipitation the magnitudes of the thermal liquid water flux qlt and the isothermal and thermal vapour fluxes qvh qvt were both very small less than 10 2 mm d 1 between depths of 150 cm and 250 cm fig 9c showed that the isothermal liquid water flux qlh at depths of 150 cm and 250 cm was positive and relatively large up to 0 04 mm d 1 additionally these values at depths above 150 cm and below 250 cm were almost equal to zero therefore the following conclusions could be drawn that 1 the isothermal liquid water flux was the major component of the soil moisture variations 2 there were significant soil matric potential gradients in the soil layers between depths of 150 cm and 250 cm and 3 the soil water contents between 150 cm and 210 cm depth were mainly affected by the adjacent soil layers the soil moisture above 150 cm depth was low approximately 1 3 and that below 250 cm depth was high approximately 10 12 the high permeability and upward hydraulic conductivity of the sandy soil caused the soil water below 250 cm depth to move to the layer between depths of 150 cm and 210 cm and increased the soil water content in addition soil water below the depth of 250 cm was stable during no precipitation periods therefore the soil water contents at depths from 150 cm to 210 cm increase in an approximately linear manner for the case of precipitation the thermal liquid water flux qlt and the isothermal and thermal vapour fluxes qvh qvt were very weak and can be neglected in the entire soil water regime the matric potential gradient can significantly cause liquid water transport and variations in the upper soil layers because of the influence of precipitation fig 9c showed that the infiltration depth caused by precipitation was approximately 70 cm therefore precipitation could not affect soil water variations below the depth of 100 cm in addition the liquid water flux caused by the matric potential below the 250 cm depth was almost zero which suggested that the soil water variations between depths of 150 cm and 250 cm were minimally affected or recharged by capillary rise from groundwater 4 2 the influence of the enhancement factor on thermal vapour flux according to eq 17 the value of the enhancement factor η was greater than 9 5 in this study the enhancement factor was between 9 6 and 12 5 to assess the influence of the enhancement factor on thermal vapour hydraulic conductivity kvt and vapour flux qvt we ran three sets of simulations assuming an enhancement factor of 1 5 and 10 as showed in fig 10 the distributions of the three kvt profiles corresponding to the three values of the enhancement factor were similar and their values of kvt became enlarged with the increasing of the enhancement factor similarly when the enhancement factor increased the absolute values of water vapour flux along the profile were increasing therefore the simulation is shown that the enhancement factor positively influences vapour transfer and promotes the vapour flux in dry soils however there are many discussions about the rationality and uncertainty of the enhancement factor for simulating soil water vapour and heat transport the current theory describing the coupling of soil water vapour and heat is mostly based on the diffusion vapour flow theory by philip and de vries 1957 the estimation of vapour transfer in the vadose zone has many challenges due to the lack of field and experimental observations cahill and parlange 1998 reported that there was reasonable agreement between the water vapour flux calculated by the mass transfer equation and the vapour flux calculated by the energy equation however they found that the pdv theory significantly underestimated the magnitude of the vapour flux heitman et al 2008 observed agreement between calculated and measured distributions of the soil water content and temperature however their model predictions were less similar to measured values when the boundary conditions changed drastically i e reversal of the temperature gradient the simulation using a pore scale model showed that conventional models are likely to overestimate vapour transfer in pores shahraeeni and or 2012 novak 2016 reanalysed coupled soil moisture and heat flow using the field measurements of cahill and parlange 1998 and found that the results of cahill and parlange 1998 model were not consistent with those based on philip and de vries 1957 therefore conclusions of cahill and parlange 1998 and parlange et al 1998 both included errors these differences between studies indicate that the current theory of vapour flux does not account for some important physical processes because of the absence of direct experimental studies of vapour transport through porous media therefore it is necessary to further develop the theory of diffusion vapour flow in order to better describe the water vapour transport mechanism in laboratory and field conditions 5 conclusions this paper studied the ejina delta which is mostly covered by the gobi desert to better understand the processes of water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone field experiments were conducted to observe the evolution of the water content and thermal profiles of the soil and the depth of the water table during doys 114 and 212 24 april 31 july 2014 the hydrus 1d model was employed to investigate the mechanisms of liquid water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone the hydrus 1d model accurately simulated the soil moisture and temperature regimes of the desert vadose zone in the extremely arid environment of the study area the soil water and temperatures near the land surface were the lowest and highest respectively for the entire soil profile and both factors exhibited visible daily fluctuations the soil temperature significantly affected the movement of vapour the movement of vapour was the most important component of the total water flux system in the desert vadose zone the thermal vapour flux from the soil temperature gradient comprised almost the total water flux in the desert vadose zone and occurred only in the upper layer of this zone the thermal liquid flux and isothermal water and vapour fluxes approached 0 mm d 1 and could be ignored with respect to the total water flux of the dry soil however the isothermal liquid flux near the land surface that was caused by the matric potential gradient had a significant downward vector 2 3 mm d 1 because of the effect of precipitation therefore the matric potential gradient caused by the precipitation became the main driving factor in the spatio temporal distribution of the liquid water in the soil near the land surface the precipitation also prevented or weakened the vapour flux in the desert vadose zone

7469,the transport of water and vapour in the desert vadose zone plays a critical role in the overall water and energy balances of near surface environments in arid regions however field measurements in extremely dry environments face many difficulties and challenges so few studies have examined water and vapour transport processes in the desert vadose zone the main objective of this study is to analyse the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone depth of 350 cm by using measured and modelled data in an extremely arid environment the field experiments are implemented in an area of the gobi desert in northwestern china to measure the soil properties daily soil moisture and temperature daily water table depth and temperature and daily meteorological records from doys days of year 114 212 in 2014 growing season the hydrus 1d model which simulates the coupled transport of water vapour and heat in the vadose zone is employed to simulate the layered soil moisture and temperature regimes and analyse the transport processes of soil water and vapour the measured results show that the soil water and temperatures near the land surface have visible daily fluctuations across the entire soil profile thermal vapour movement is the most important component of the total water flux and the soil temperature gradient is the major driving factor that affects vapour transport in the desert vadose zone the most active water and heat exchange occurs in the upper soil layer depths of 0 25 cm the matric potential change from the precipitation mainly re draws the spatio temporal distribution of the isothermal liquid water in the soil near the land surface the matric potential has little effect on the isothermal vapour and thermal liquid water flux these findings offer new insights into the liquid water and vapour movement processes in the extremely arid environment keywords transport mechanism soil temperature and matric potential liquid water and vapour field experiments and simulations desert vadose zone 1 introduction the vadose zone links rainfall surface water groundwater and soil water and facilitates the exchange and allocation of the water and energy in the hydrological cycle of earth s land surface system pfletschinger et al 2014 moradi et al 2016 in arid regions where the soil water content is very low vapour movement is a particularly important component of the total water flux in the vadose zone milly 1984 saito et al 2006 zeng et al 2009a b huang et al 2016 hou et al 2016 therefore investigating the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport is critical to understanding the water and energy balances of arid regions for agricultural and ecological applications soil moisture especially near the soil surface is influenced by evaporation precipitation and other vadose zone properties soil drying is the process through which liquid water and vapour water in the vadose zone are transferred into the atmosphere via heat conduction rutten et al 2010 this process is generally separated into three distinct stages during stage one with a relatively high and stable rate soil evaporation is the maximum or potential rate of drying that occurs when the soil surface is at or near saturation and is determined by climatic conditions salvucci 1997 wilson et al 2011 during stage two with a falling rate the hydraulic conductivity of the soil controls the evaporation because the soil moisture gradually becomes scarce and no longer permits a sufficient flow to maintain the potential evaporative rate boulet et al 1997 or et al 2013 kool et al 2014 during stage three with a low and stable rate the soil moisture reaches a slow residual value so the weak and stable vapour diffusion becomes the major process of migrating to the surface tarnawski and leong 2000 wilson et al 2011 in arid regions the soil moisture approaches the soil residual water content reducing the soil hydraulic conductivity and increasing the vapour content consequently vapour movement becomes the major component of the water movement in dry soils saito et al 2006 zeng et al 2011a b the quantitative study of soil water movement began at the beginning of 1900s russell 1909 the capillary potential was expounded by buckingham 1904 and was gradually introduced to quantitatively describe soil water movement philip 1957 on the basis of the concept of capillary potential the channels in soils might be generalized as bundles of capillary tubes that control the rate of the flow of water and air through soils green and ampt 1911 richards 1931 presented a continuous flow equation of variably saturated soil hereafter the richards equation according to the gradient of soil water potential with all its components zha et al 2016 after that studying soil water movement stepped into modelling times philip and de vries 1957 provided a mathematical model of liquid water and vapour transport through soils based on the richards equation that was driven by both the pressure head isothermal and soil temperature gradients thermal hereafter the pdv model since then the pdv model has been the theoretical basis for studying the interactions among liquid water vapour and heat transports in unsaturated soils milly 1982 modified the pdv model by using the matric potential gradient instead of the soil water content gradient to investigate the mechanism of water and vapour transports in heterogeneous soils the pdv model was also later extended by nassar and horton 1989 who considered the effect of an osmotic potential gradient on the coupled transport of water solutes and heat in the vadose zone however cahill and parlange 1998 found that the soil water and vapour fluxes that were estimated by the mass and energy conservation equation were higher than and opposite those in the pdv model most of the above models were developed according to some assumptions e g a representative elementary volume and laboratory experiments while field experiments completely lacked any support for these assumptions smits et al 2011 min et al 2015 wang et al 2011 found that the soil temperature gradient significant strengthened the soil water movement when the temperature difference between the land surface and the phreatic water was greater than 10 c according to the long term observations of soil water movements saito et al 2006 developed a numerical model of coupled liquid water vapour and heat transport in the soil that included the surface water and energy balance from field experiment data zeng et al 2011a b considered the effect of the dry soil airflow on the convection of vapour by using a new model of the coupled water vapour and heat of the soil however mohanty and yang 2013 commented that zeng et al s model overestimated the influence of the soil airflow on the isothermal vapour hydraulic conductivities zeng and su 2013 thought that such claim was not systemic and the total vapour flux consists of isothermal thermal fluxes and convective fluxes and these three types of fluxes were relevant and were driven by the air pressure gradient in addition gao and shao 2015 confirmed that the soil temperature could affect soil water and vapour transport by influencing the soil texture water viscosity hydraulic conductivity vapour diffusion rate heat capacity etc although both liquid water and vapour transport are widely recognized to be closely related the mechanism of soil water and vapour transfer is complicated and requires further study in arid or semiarid regions the vapour movement in the dry vadose zone becomes very important because the soil moisture is very low such vapour transport in the dry soils occurs stage three of the soil drying process defined in this paper although this vapour transfer is low and stable the water that is lost to the atmosphere cannot be ignored because of the large areas of the global arid and semiarid regions tang and riley 2013 yuan et al 2015 therefore vapour transport in the dry vadose zone can considerably influence the regional water and energy balances and climate change in arid or semiarid regions many studies have investigated soil liquid water and vapour transport within the soil column in the laboratory gierke et al 1992 pfletschinger et al 2012 hernández lópez et al 2014 however the soil atmosphere interface is an important boundary condition that affects the subsurface movements of liquid water vapour and heat in the field especially for dry soils direct measurements of all the components that affect the water and energy balances at the soil surface over short time intervals are rarely available additionally few studies have examined the mechanisms of water and vapour transport in the vadose zone in an arid desert environment as observed in the field zeng et al 2009a b hou et al 2016 in extremely arid regions local precipitation is particularly rare very little runoff is generated so the movement of vapour from the vadose zone into the atmosphere influences the regional water and energy balances and the ecological water flow schedule and management investigating the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport is a direct approach to address the above issues in this study the ejina delta which is located within and desert environment was chosen as the study area this delta is located in the lower reaches of the heihe river basin which is the second largest inland river basin in the arid region of northwestern china systematic measurements of the soil moisture soil temperature groundwater and micrometeorological variables were recorded the hydrus 1d model which is a coupled liquid water vapour and heat transfer model was applied in the study area the objectives of this study are to 1 describe the daily patterns of the soil water and temperature regimes 2 quantify the main variables of this system soil temperature and soil matric potential and 3 analyse the effects of the soil temperature and matric potential gradients and precipitation on the liquid and vapour transports in the desert vadose zone 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the eijina delta 11 000 km2 is located in the lower reaches of the heihe river basin in the arid region of northwestern china figs 1 and 2 the climatic conditions of the study area are extremely arid and are characterized by very hot summers very cold winters sparse precipitation large evaporation capacity adequate sunshine and strong sandstorms according to climate data from the ejina weather station fig 1 during 1961 2015 the mean annual air temperature was 9 1 c with a lowest monthly average temperature of 11 2 c in january and a highest monthly average temperature of 27 1 c in july the mean annual precipitation was 35 2 mm with a maximum of 101 1 mm in 1969 and a minimum of 7 0 mm in 1983 and the annual precipitation was seasonally distributed with approximately 75 of the annual precipitation falling during june september wang et al 2014a the potential evaporation in the study area was very high approximately 1444 mm during the period of the data and was 40 times the mean annual precipitation du et al 2016 in the study area the river system which originates from the heihe river and is divided into two intermittent rivers the east and west rivers after the hydrological station flows through the extensive gobi desert ending at its terminal lakes east and west juyan lakes fig 1 the river system is the primary water source for the riparian vegetation and the shallow groundwater min et al 2013 wang et al 2014b has allowed a natural oasis to form in the gobi desert wang et al 2013 approximately 72 of the delta consists of gobi desert zhang et al 2011 the gobi desert surface is covered with scattered black gravel which is a unique protective layer in this gobi desert and can significantly affect the energy exchange at the surface the remaining 28 of the delta consists of two desert vegetation zones which are densely distributed along the riparian and scattered throughout the gobi desert zhang et al 2011 according to the groundwater table gwt the elevation of the groundwater table data from the observational wells the average water table depth is approximately 3 0 m across the delta this depth varies between 2 0 and 8 5 m from the south to the north of the delta wang et al 2014b 2 2 experimental site 2 2 1 instruments and observations observational system of the desert vadose zone requires aboveground and belowground components fig 2 the aboveground observational instrument was a micro weather station this station monitored the precipitation air temperature air pressure relative humidity and wind speed and direction the daily changes in these atmospheric conditions are shown in fig 3 a e the gwt depth and temperature are the underground factors that were monitored the gwt depth was obtained with a correction of the pressure head and the local barometric pressure the pressure head was monitored with a schlumberger mini diver pressure transducer that was located at an approximate depth of 8 7 m the mini diver had a pressure range of 10 m with a resolution of 2 mm and an accuracy of 5 mm the barometric pressure correction was taken from the micro weather station the groundwater temperature was simultaneously recorded by the transducer with a range from 20 c to 80 c a resolution of 0 01 c and an accuracy of 0 1 c fig 3f shows the corrected gwt depth and temperature at the experimental site from 24 april to 31 july 2014 six soil moisture probes fds 100 sensor that monitored the soil water contents and temperatures were installed at the following depths 20 150 210 265 300 and 320 cm fig 2c the soil texture directly affects the actual performance of the soil moisture sensor in different types of soils so the raw data from the sensor had to be calibrated by the actual transformation parameters for different soil textures the fds 100 sensor derived the volumetric soil moisture θ values from the soil dielectric capacity by using the following equation gao et al 2006 1 θ a v b where θ is the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 v is the output voltage of the probe v and a and b are the transformation parameters with default values of 0 00571 and 225 2 respectively the θ and v values for calibration were obtained by measuring the voltage of the probe in dry to saturated soil samples during the laboratory experiments at the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences the calibrated soil water contents strongly matched the measured values at the experimental site 2 2 2 measurement data fig 3a e show the meteorological conditions during the experimental period from 24 april to 31 july 2014 the atmospheric pressure regularly varied between 88 5 and 90 7 kpa with a daily mean of 89 4 kpa the air temperature had a significantly increasing trend and varied from 4 8 to 32 6 c with a daily average of 23 4 c the surface temperature had similar variations with a daily average of 28 1 c the daily air relative humidity values fluctuated between 6 and 71 the daily variations in the wind speeds were very strong with a maximum of 7 6 m s 1 and a daily average of approximately 3 2 m s 1 the precipitation before 28 june 2014 was almost zero but the precipitation during 28 june and 31 july 2014 was approximately 63 2 mm comprising almost all the precipitation of this year the evaporation was larger with a mean of 3 0 mm d 1 during the experimental period the gwt observations are shown in fig 3 f during doys 114 and 191 namely from 24 april to 10 july the gwt fluctuations were stable with daily depths between 363 1 and 366 0 cm and an average of 364 9 cm in the study area the groundwater dynamic was mainly affected by the river flow regime of the east and west river channels the river flowed during june and july and the rivers were recharged by the scheduled streamflow from the upstream area of the heihe river basin therefore the gwt rapidly increased following doy 192 11 july and the minimum depth the maximum water table reached 358 cm on doy 200 as shown in fig 3b the groundwater temperature increased at an exponential rate during the experimental period at the end of april and the beginning of may the groundwater temperature was lower and almost constant with a daily mean of 12 c after doy 127 the groundwater temperature began to gradually rise from 12 c to 13 3 c 2 2 3 soil properties the soil profile was approximately 350 cm thick soil samples were collected from each of the soil layers at intervals of 50 cm along the profile to analyse the soil properties three repeated samples were excavated for every layer soil to ensure sample reliability these samples were taken to the laboratory to measure the soil particle size distribution soil bulk density and hydraulic conductivity laboratory analyses of the soil particle sizes were performed according to the soil classification system of the united states department of agriculture usda by using the vibration sieve method 0 05 mm and laser particle size analysis 0 05 mm the soil bulk density was measured by using the excavation method grossman and reinsch 2002 undisturbed soil samples were extracted by using sealed ring containers φ50 46 50 mm 100 cm3 the gravimetric and volumetric bulk densities were estimated by weighing the dry soil weights and volume the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity was measured by using a saturated permeability tester with a fixed water head method bs stxs11 1 the soil water retention curves of all the samples were obtained by using a hitachi cr21giii centrifuge the above soil experiments were completed in the laboratory of soil water processes of the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences the measured physical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 the bulk densities from the top to the bottom of the soil profiles were approximately 1 57 g cm 3 similarly all the soil samples consisted of nearly 100 sand the estimated hydraulic conductivities of the soil varied from 1250 to 1450 cm d 1 along the soil profile the soil hydraulic parameters in table 2 were obtained by a simultaneous fitting of soil water retention data with the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 table 1 showed the nse of the measured and the fitted soil water retention curves for each soil layers and the nse values were more than 0 80 which illustrated that the parameters estimated by van genuchten equation were reliable tables 1 and 2 were input into the following numerical model as the soil hydraulic parameters 2 3 numerical modelling liquid water and gaseous water vapour are two phases of soil water soil water movement includes both liquid water and vapour movement in dry soils the vapour flux is the rate of vapour movement in the soil and the total water flux is the combined rate of liquid water and vapour movement in the soil the direction of soil water movement may be upward or downward if the vapour transfer in the soil is upward from the soil surface into the atmosphere the upward vapour flux is soil evaporation the hydrus 1d model has often been used to simulate continuous changes in the water content temperature and fluxes of bare field soils huang et al 2016 therefore this study employed a hydrus 1d model that was modified by saito et al 2006 to simulate the transfer water and vapour in a desert vadose zone 2 3 1 model description the governing equation for the one dimensional vertical flow of liquid water and vapour in the vadose zone is described by the following mass conservation equation saito et al 2006 2 θ t q l z q v z s where θ is the total liquid water and water vapour content cm3 cm 3 t is the time d ql and qv are the flux rates of liquid water and vapour cm d 1 respectively z is the vertical axis which is positive upward cm and s is a general sink or source term d 1 which primarily include the root water uptake the precipitation soil evaporation infiltration bottom drainage capillary rise from groundwater table etc are generally considered as boundary conditions and not as the source or sink terms of the soil water flow equation in this study s is zero because no roots are present in the desert vadose zone the flux rate of liquid water ql is described as follows philip and de vries 1957 3 q l q lh q lt k lh h z 1 k lt t z where qlh and qlt are the isothermal and thermal liquid water flux rates cm d 1 respectively and klh cm d 1 and klt cm2 c 1 d 1 are the hydraulic conductivities of liquid water in soils from the gradients of the pressure head h cm and temperature t c respectively if we assume that the relative humidity in the soil pores remains constant with changes in temperature philip and de vries 1957 the vapour flux rate qv can also be separated into two components as follows 4 q v q vh q vt k vh h z k vt t z where qvh and qvt are the isothermal and thermal vapour flux rates cm d 1 respectively and kvh cm d 1 and kvt cm2 c 1 d 1 are the corresponding vapour hydraulic conductivities respectively if eqs 3 and 4 are brought into eq 2 the governing equation of liquid water and vapour flow can be written as follows 5 θ t z k hh h z k tt t z k lh 6 k hh k lh k vh 7 k tt k lt k vt where khh cm d 1 and ktt cm2 c 1 d 1 are the total isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities respectively therefore the vapour flux is the sum of the isothermal and thermal vapour flux and the total water flux includes the isothermal and thermal liquid water flux and the vapour flux 2 3 2 soil hydraulic parameters we chose to use the mualem van genuchten model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 to describe the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity function the isothermal hydraulic conductivity klh was estimated by using the pore size distribution model of mualem 1976 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity 8 k lh k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 se is the effective saturation and l and m are empirical parameters the parameter l was assigned a value of 0 5 as suggested by mualem 1976 and the value of m 1 1 n was determined by fitting van genuchten s analytical model to the water retention data with the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 van genuchten s analytical model is as follows 9 θ l θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 where θl is the liquid water content cm3 cm 3 θr and θs are the saturated and residual water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively and α cm 1 and n are empirical shape parameters which can be obtained by fitting the measured water retention curve data the thermal hydraulic conductivity klt is defined as follows noborio et al 1996 saito et al 2006 10 k lt k lh hg wt 1 γ 0 d γ dt where gwt is the gain factor which quantifies the temperature dependence of the soil water retention curve and was 7 for the sandy soil in this study nimmo and miller 1986 γ is the surface tension of the soil water j cm2 and γ 0 is the surface tension at 25 c 71 89 g s 2 saito et al 2006 the temperature dependence of γ is provided by 11 γ 75 6 0 1425 t 2 38 10 4 t 2 where t is in c the isothermal kvh and thermal kvt vapour hydraulic conductivities are described as follows nassar and horton 1989 noborio et al 1996 12 k vh d ρ w ρ sv mg rt h r 13 k vt d ρ w η h r d ρ sv dt where d is the vapour diffusivity in the soil cm2 d 1 ρw and ρsv are the densities of liquid water and saturated vapour g cm 3 respectively m is the molecular weight of water g mol 1 g is the gravitational acceleration cm s 2 r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 c 1 hr is the relative humidity and η is the enhancement factor these parameters were taken from the work of saito et al 2006 the vapour diffusivity d of the soil is defined as follows 14 d τ θ a d a where θa is the air filled porosity cm3 cm 3 τ θ a 7 3 θ s 2 is the tortuosity factor millington and quirk 1961 and da is the diffusivity of water vapour in air at temperature t c the mathematical expression of hr is described as follows 15 h r exp hmg rt the saturated vapour density ρsv as a function of temperature is expressed as 16 ρ sv 10 3 1 t exp 31 716 6014 79 t 7 92495 10 3 t because the mass fractions of clay in all soil layers are zero table 1 the enhancement factor may be abbreviated as campbell 1985 17 η 9 5 3 θ θ s 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions 2 3 3 1 initial conditions the soil profile was 380 cm in depth a spatial discretization of 1 cm was used creating 381 nodes across the profile the nodes at 20 cm 150 cm 210 cm 265 cm 300 cm and 320 cm were selected to compare the calculated soil water contents and temperature with the measured values fig 3g and h the calculations were performed for a period of 99 days from 24 april to 31 july in 2014 the temporal discretization varied between a minimum and maximum time step and was controlled by a time step criterion running the program required specifying the initial conditions for the soil water content and temperature of the entire profile which were determined by interpolating the measured values from the observed depths on 24 april 2014 2 3 3 2 boundary conditions the study area is located in an extremely arid region so no ponding or surface runoff was considered thus the moisture flux out of the soil equalled to the evaporation minus the precipitation 18 q l z 0 e p where e is the evaporation rate cm d 1 and p is the precipitation rate cm d 1 surface evaporation is controlled by the atmospheric conditions surface moisture and moisture transport in the soil so the evaporation when considering all these factors is often calculated as camillo and gurney 1986 campbell 1985 19 e ρ v ρ a r v r a 20 r v 1 8 64 10 6 1 u k ln z ref d z h z h ϕ h 21 r a 1 8 64 10 6 805 4140 θ s θ top where ρv is the vapour density at the soil surface g cm 3 ρa is the atmospheric vapour density g cm 3 rv is the aerodynamic resistance to water vapour flow d cm 1 and ra is the soil surface resistance to vapour flow d cm 1 when the soil water is at or near saturation the evaporation equals the potential evaporation however the evaporation is determined by the actual soil water according to eq 19 the hydrus 1d model can calculate the potential evaporation by using food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommended penman monteith combination equation allen et al 1998 and the meteorological data fig 3a e and further determine actual evaporation based on the availability of water in the soil profile and potential evaporation the groundwater level was the bottom boundary condition and was chosen according to the field monitoring results fig 3f the upper and lower boundary conditions for the heat transport were determined by the measured surface temperature and groundwater temperature 3 results 3 1 modelling results in this section the simulated soil water content and soil temperatures are compared to the measured values to describe the accuracy of the modelling results this study employed an indicator specifically the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse to evaluate the differences between the measured and simulated values the nse has been commonly used to assess the predictive power of hydrological discharge models this value is defined as follows nash and sutcliffe 1970 22 nse 1 t 1 n x o t x m t 2 t 1 n x o t x o 2 where x o t and x m t are the observed and modelled values at time t respectively x o is the mean of the observed values and n is the number of time samples the nse can range from to 1 an efficiency of 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the model and observations an efficiency of 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency of less than zero nse 0 occurs when the observed mean is a better predictor than the model this method has also been used to quantitatively assess the accuracy of other types of models such as sediment temperature and concentration models moriasi et al 2007 3 1 1 soil water contents the soil water contents of the profile were calculated by using the hydrus 1d model fig 4 depicted the simulated and measured soil water contents at depths of 20 cm 150 cm 210 cm 265 cm 300 cm and 320 cm the nses of the soil water contents at the measured depths were 0 972 0 959 0 958 0 900 0 901 and 0 994 respectively table 3 overall the simulated soil water contents at different depths agreed well with the measured data fig 4 shows different regimes for the soil water contents from the top to the bottom of the soil profile over the entire soil profile the soil water contents above a depth of 250 cm were low and their variations were between 1 5 and 5 however the soil water contents below this depth were greater with a variation range of 6 17 at a depth of 20 cm the model could capture the visible changes in the soil water content near the surface that were caused by precipitation during doys 114 and 179 which experienced no rainfall the soil water content was very low and remained stable with a daily mean variation of approximately 1 3 fig 5 according to fig 3e a relatively concentrated precipitation event occurred after doy 180 correspondingly the soil water content significantly increased from 1 3 to 4 8 because of the infiltration of the precipitation the soil water contents of the soil layers at the depths of 150 cm and 210 cm continued to linearly increase from 1 7 to 2 3 during the experiment the soil layers at depths of 150 cm and 210 cm were far from the surface and groundwater table the hydraulic conductivity of these soil layers was lower effects of the infiltration of water due to the precipitation and capillary rise from groundwater on soil water were both very weak therefore the soil water contents at depths of 150 and 210 cm were directly affected by the soil water regime of the adjacent soil layers similar soil water content regimes were present at depths of 265 cm 300 cm and 320 cm these layers remained almost constant during doys 114 and 191 but their soil water contents significantly increased after doy 192 during the experimental period the measured soil water content at a depth of 265 cm was between 10 4 and 16 8 with a daily average of 11 6 the measured values at a depth of 300 cm varied from 7 6 to 12 6 with a mean of 8 6 the measured soil moisture at 320 cm was between 6 7 and 13 3 with a mean of 7 8 as shown in figs 3f and 4 the soil moisture gradually decreased along the soil profile from 265 cm to 320 cm when the gwt was low and stable however the soil moisture increased when the gwt increased and recharged the soil near the water table via soil capillarity with this increase being greater with increasing depth moreover fig 4 shows that the model did not reflect the sudden changes in soil moisture at depths from 250 cm to 300 cm the soils between 265 cm and 300 cm depths contained some large grain gravel φ 2 cm this gravel could not be described by the current soil classification system of the united states department of agriculture usda in hydrus 1d model the hydraulic parameters were determined by rosetta model an inverse model for the water flow parameter based on the above soil particle distribution not include gravel however these parameters could not truly reflect the soil properties and water flow behaviors due to the rough or incomplete soil classification system in addition the inherent assumptions of the model e g the equilibrium inter phase mass exchange also impacted the capture of the coupled processes between solid liquid and vapour three phases which required further tests and sensitivity analyses using the direct experimental observations in the future works 3 1 2 soil temperatures in this study the soil temperature simulations needed to determine the heat transport parameters of the hydrud 1d the heat transport parameters of for layered soils mainly referred to the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the solid phase and liquid phase the volumetric heat capacity of the liquid phase was a given constant 4 2 103 j kg 1 c the volumetric heat capacity of the soil phase could be determined by physical measurements but the measurement method consumed both time and effort the measured values were not highly accurate and only a reference for model calibration in addition the thermal conductivity in this study was determined by the following equation chung and horton 1987 23 λ 0 θ b 1 b 2 θ b 3 θ 0 5 where b 1 b 2 and b 3 are empirical parameters which are generally obtained by the model calibration rather than by physical measurements therefore during the simulation of soil temperatures the heat transport parameters were obtained by model calibration for different soil layers fig 5 shows the simulated and measured soil temperatures at 20 cm 150 cm 210 cm 265 cm 300 cm and 320 cm the nses of the soil temperatures were 0 969 0 982 0 975 0 961 0 979 and 0 974 respectively this result showed that the model could simulate the soil temperature dynamics the soil temperatures at every layer gradually increased with time during the experimental period but the soil temperatures along the profile decreased with increasing depth among the measured layers the soil temperatures at 20 cm the upper layer were the highest and had significant fluctuations the variations in soil temperature were dominated by the ground surface s energy balance i e as reflected by the surface temperature however the soil temperature changes below 150 cm were smooth with minimal variations and resembled the groundwater temperature changes 3 2 effect of soil temperature on water and vapour transfer 3 2 1 soil temperature and temperature gradient fields the soil temperature regime is an indicator of changes in soil heat we must study the temperature field of the dester vadose zone to understand the variations and mechanisms of soil heat a contour map of the soil temperatures with intervals of 2 c shows the daily variations in the soil temperature profiles from doys 114 to 212 fig 6 a as shown in fig 6a the density of the contours decreased with increasing depth during the experimental period the soil temperatures changed from 6 0 c to 29 6 c at the top layer of the soil profile and from 10 1 c to 15 6 c at the bottom layer the temperature gradient of the entire profile was approximately 0 04 c cm 1 however the temperature profile was not uniformly distributed across the column the influencing depth and range of the soil temperature gradually increased as the surface temperature increased throughout the experimental period the maximum temperature of the entire profile occurred at approximately 20 50 cm depth and its location was gradually moving down with time and was not fixed at the depth of 20 cm where the sensor was located the temperature contours were dense at depths of 0 100 cm and became sparse below 100 cm additionally the variations in the soil temperature decreased with increasing depth the soil temperatures in the top layers varied considerably while those in the lower layers varied only slightly the information from the contours below 350 cm is not shown in fig 6a because almost no variations in the soil temperature occurred below this depth it should be aware that there was a wide depth interval between depths from 20 to 150 cm this was mainly due to consider the uneven distributions of soil moisture profile the soil moistures of the upper layers above the depth of 200 cm were relatively dry and had no significant changes along the profile but the soil moistures of the lower layers below 200 cm depth became greater and significantly varied along the profile in order to capture the variation of soil moisture along the profile the probes were installed according to the soil moisture profile because the upper soil was very dry the heat transfer of the upper soil was mainly affected by the soil texture solid medium and the impact of soil moisture on heat conduction could be negligible heat transport parameters of the solid medium of all layers were almost same due to the relatively uniform soil texture along the entire profile the measured soil temperatures at depths of 20 and 150 cm could control variations of the soil temperature profile and capture the characteristics of the thermal profile however the soil moisture of the lower layers varied greatly and the liquid water affected the heat transfer if the observation density of soil temperatures near the bottom were not added the sparse observations could leave some uncertainty on the characteristics of the thermal profile and its evolution as time progresses the contours of the profile became denser and gradually moved downwards along the profile thus the soil temperature of the entire profile increased and varied considerably before doy 160 temperatures were lower across the profile and any variations were weak however these characteristics reversed after doy 160 fig 6b depicts the spatio temporal temperature gradient field and clearly shows how the heat transport in the soil controlled the spatio temporal dependences of the temperature gradient profiles the variations in the contours of the temperature gradient in fig 6b matched those in fig 6a the density of the contours became sparse with increasing depth indicating that the effects of soil temperature on soil water movement become gradually weaker according to the temperature gradient profiles the contours at depths of 0 25 cm were very dense between depths of 0 cm and 25 cm the temperature gradient was negative and the mean value and maximum gradient were 0 21 c cm 1 and 0 8 c cm 1 respectively thus 0 25 cm was the most active layer for heat exchange however the gradient was 0 c cm 1 at approximately 25 cm the gradient below 25 cm was positive the gradient values decreased and the contours became sparse with increasing depth another zero gradient line occurred at 280 cm depth thus these two depths were defined as the zero heat flux planes two types of zero heat flux planes occurred one was a divergent plane with the temperature gradients above and below this plane being positive and negative upwards and downwards respectively and the other was a convergent plane with the opposite gradient directions from those of the divergent plane the upper zero heat flux plane was a divergent plane throughout the study period the soil water moved to the surface above this plane and was transported downward below this plane however the lower zero heat flux plane was a convergent plane the soil water moved downward above this plane and upward below this plane the zero heat flux plane could be regarded as a critical point at which the direction of the temperature gradient was reversed 3 2 2 thermal flux from the soil temperature according to eqs 3 and 4 the thermal liquid water qlt and vapour qvt fluxes were affected by the soil temperature fig 7 c and d show the spatio temporal distributions of the thermal liquid and vapour fluxes from the hydrus 1d model following the definitions of divergent and convergent planes in fig 6b thermal fluxes occurred in the upper convergent plane in fig 6c and d the thermal fluxes below the lower zero flux plane are almost zero this plane is neither divergent nor convergent fig 6c shows two zero thermal liquid flux planes which correspond to the zero heat flux planes during the simulation period the upper thermal liquid zero flux plane was at approximately 25 cm and was a divergent plane i e above this plane the flux was upward and positive during the period with no precipitation doys 114 179 the thermal liquid flux contour lines were sparse showing that the liquid flux from the temperature was weak however at the start of the period with precipitation doys 180 212 the thermal liquid water flux contour lines rapidly became denser and the flux magnitude increased considerably rising to 0 4 mm d 1 by the end of the experimental period the lower zero thermal liquid flux plane was approximately 250 cm deep and was a convergent plane below this plane the flux from the temperature gradient was positive upward and very weak near the saturated soil layer between the two zero thermal liquid flux planes the contours were sparse and non uniform and the negative downward flux was very low the spatio temporal distribution of the thermal vapour flux field is shown in fig 6d and was found to be similar to the distribution of the thermal liquid water flux two different zero vapour flux planes were present above the upper plane depth of 25 cm the thermal vapour water flux was still strong and rose to 0 14 mm d 1 therefore acting as the main contributor to the total water flux of the desert vadose zone between the two planes the contours were sparse and the thermal vapour flux was weak and downwards similarly the vapour flux below the lower zero flux plane was very weak because of the near saturation of the soil fig 7 depicts the distributions of the thermal liquid and vapour fluxes along the profile on doy 125 with no precipitation and doy 200 with precipitation fig 7a shows that the thermal liquid water flux of the soil profile in the desert vadose zone profile was almost zero in the absence of precipitation the soil was very dry and the liquid water in the soil pores lost its capillary connection so the soil temperature gradients had little effect on the transport of liquid water although the soil water content was very low the vapour water became the major component of the soil water in the desert vadose zone the soil temperature gradients could form a strong driving force to increase the transport of vapour water fig 7b depicts the vapour flux rate of the soil profile from soil temperature gradient fig 6b shows a stronger temperature gradient in the upper layers depths of approximately 0 100 cm correspondingly the thermal vapour fluxes of the upper layers were very high the value in the surface reached 0 1 mm d 1 however the temperature gradient rapidly decreased with increasing depth as did the thermal vapour flux when precipitation occurred on the surface the soil water content in the surface soil increased and the upward soil temperature gradient caused the liquid water to move upward precipitation only recharge the soil water within the upper layer because of the small amount of precipitation less than 6 mm d 1 with the recharge depths being approximately 30 cm fig 7c as shown in fig 7b and c the thermal vapour flux in the desert vadose zone after being recharged by precipitation was much lower than that without precipitation recharge thus precipitation could reduce or prevent the transfer of thermal vapour 3 3 effect of the matric potential on water and vapour transfer 3 3 1 soil matric potential and its gradients fields the soil water potential describes the influence of the flow of water in liquid and vapour phases in the vadose zone soil water moves from regions with high potential to regions with low potential jury and horton 2004 in this study the soil water potential consisted of the gravitational component of the water potential and matric potential the gravitational component of the water potential equalled the elevation above positive or below negative a reference datum the ground surface was used as this reference datum so the gravitational component of the water potential was negative the matric component of the soil water potential represents the influence of the adsorption and capillarity in the retention of water in the pore walls the desert soil in our study was very dry and the matric potential was therefore difficult to directly monitor so the soil moisture was measured and transformed into the matric potential by using the soil water retention curve the daily variations in the matric potential profiles are shown in fig 8 a the contours changed from dense to sparse with increasing depth thus the matric potential varied strongly in the upper layer but changed more slowly toward the lower layers the matric potential fluctuated from 6000 cm to 200 cm at the surface and varied from 30 cm to 10 cm at the bottom of the profile consequently the variations in the soil matric potential were very large the matric potential near the surface was the lowest becoming larger only with increasing depth which indicates that the gradient of the matric component of the soil water potential induced the upward flow of water in liquid and vapour phases during the measurement period fig 8b shows the spatio temporal variations in the matric potential gradients in the desert vadose zone the contours were not depicted uniformly because of the large differences in the matric potential gradients along the profile in fig 8b the patterns of the gradient were similar to the pattern of the matric potential four gradient centres were present over the spatio temporal field the first gradient centre was the low value centre which occurred at a depth between 0 cm and 10 cm the contours near the surface were the most intense therefore the gradient fluctuations were strongest near the surface the other three gradient centres had high values two gradient centres with high values matric potential 10 200 cm occurred at depths between 10 cm and 100 cm during doys 144 and 212 these results were caused by precipitation the soil water line moved downward because of the infiltration of the precipitation two zero gradient lines separated the matric gradient field into three regions as shown in fig 8b the gradients were mostly negative and tended to be larger with increasing depth 3 3 2 the isothermal flux from the soil matric potential saito et al 2006 deduced the effect of the matric potential on the isothermal liquid water qlh and vapour qvh fluxes according to pdv theory philip and de vries 1957 as determined by eqs 3 and 4 respectively fig 8c shows the variations in the isothermal liquid water flux the flux profile clearly shows how the gradient matric component of soil water potential induces the liquid water movement in space and time the pattern of the isothermal liquid water flux was similar to that of the matric potential gradients an unclosed zero flux plane occurred above 125 cm which was convergent and separated the entire profile into two different fields during the experimental period the isothermal liquid water flux pointed upwards below the zero flux plane and its mean value was approximately 0 01 mm d 1 however the isothermal liquid water flux in the upper layers pointed downward and was very strong up to 2 3 mm d 1 because of the effect of precipitation the variations in the isothermal vapour flux are shown in fig 8d the flux profile clearly shows that the matric potential had an effect on the vapour transfer in the desert vadose zone the flux fluctuation was strong in the top layer depth of approximately 10 cm the isothermal vapour flux varied from 3 8 10 6 mm d 1 to 0 006 mm d 1 at the land surface and from 4 3 10 5 mm d 1 to 2 8 10 5 mm d 1 at a depth of 5 cm almost no fluctuations occurred in the deeper layers for example the maximum and minimum fluxes at the depth of 340 cm were 2 6 10 9 mm d 1 and 4 9 10 14 mm d 1 respectively although the isothermal vapour flux was weak the direction of the flux was upward across the entire profile during the experimental period fig 9 depicts the distributions of the isothermal liquid water and vapour fluxes along the profile on doy 125 with no precipitation and doy 200 with precipitation as an example of the transport processes of the fluxes compared the liquid water flux fig 9a and c and the vapour flux fig 9a and d the matric potential had a significant effect on the liquid water transfer and almost no effect on the vapour transfer along the profile fig 9a shows that the liquid water fluxes at the upper and lower layers were upward and very weak in the absence of precipitation the matric potential gradients of the upper layers were very large and the soil water contents were very low so the capillary connections of soil pore were considerably weak as was the liquid water flux additionally the soil water contents of the lower layers were relative high but their matric potential gradients were very small and had weak effects on the liquid water transport upward however the soil water contents fig 4 and the matric potential gradients fig 8b of the middle layers on doy 125 were relatively higher so the matric potential gradients could form a stronger driving force to cause liquid water to move upward fig 9a in addition the infiltration of water due to the precipitation increased the soil water content which in turn affected the distribution of the soil matric potential profile fig 9c shows that the downward matric potential gradients significantly forced liquid water downward 4 discussions 4 1 mechanisms of the soil moisture variations in the layers at 150 and 210 cm the soil layer from 150 cm to 210 cm depth was far from the surface and groundwater table soil water contents at depths of 150 and 210 cm were directly affected by the soil water regimes of the adjacent soil layers figs 7 and 9 showed the liquid water vapour fluxes of the desert vadose zone with no precipitation and precipitation respectively and explained the mechanism of the soil moisture variations in the two layers figs 7a and b and 9b showed that for the case of no precipitation the magnitudes of the thermal liquid water flux qlt and the isothermal and thermal vapour fluxes qvh qvt were both very small less than 10 2 mm d 1 between depths of 150 cm and 250 cm fig 9c showed that the isothermal liquid water flux qlh at depths of 150 cm and 250 cm was positive and relatively large up to 0 04 mm d 1 additionally these values at depths above 150 cm and below 250 cm were almost equal to zero therefore the following conclusions could be drawn that 1 the isothermal liquid water flux was the major component of the soil moisture variations 2 there were significant soil matric potential gradients in the soil layers between depths of 150 cm and 250 cm and 3 the soil water contents between 150 cm and 210 cm depth were mainly affected by the adjacent soil layers the soil moisture above 150 cm depth was low approximately 1 3 and that below 250 cm depth was high approximately 10 12 the high permeability and upward hydraulic conductivity of the sandy soil caused the soil water below 250 cm depth to move to the layer between depths of 150 cm and 210 cm and increased the soil water content in addition soil water below the depth of 250 cm was stable during no precipitation periods therefore the soil water contents at depths from 150 cm to 210 cm increase in an approximately linear manner for the case of precipitation the thermal liquid water flux qlt and the isothermal and thermal vapour fluxes qvh qvt were very weak and can be neglected in the entire soil water regime the matric potential gradient can significantly cause liquid water transport and variations in the upper soil layers because of the influence of precipitation fig 9c showed that the infiltration depth caused by precipitation was approximately 70 cm therefore precipitation could not affect soil water variations below the depth of 100 cm in addition the liquid water flux caused by the matric potential below the 250 cm depth was almost zero which suggested that the soil water variations between depths of 150 cm and 250 cm were minimally affected or recharged by capillary rise from groundwater 4 2 the influence of the enhancement factor on thermal vapour flux according to eq 17 the value of the enhancement factor η was greater than 9 5 in this study the enhancement factor was between 9 6 and 12 5 to assess the influence of the enhancement factor on thermal vapour hydraulic conductivity kvt and vapour flux qvt we ran three sets of simulations assuming an enhancement factor of 1 5 and 10 as showed in fig 10 the distributions of the three kvt profiles corresponding to the three values of the enhancement factor were similar and their values of kvt became enlarged with the increasing of the enhancement factor similarly when the enhancement factor increased the absolute values of water vapour flux along the profile were increasing therefore the simulation is shown that the enhancement factor positively influences vapour transfer and promotes the vapour flux in dry soils however there are many discussions about the rationality and uncertainty of the enhancement factor for simulating soil water vapour and heat transport the current theory describing the coupling of soil water vapour and heat is mostly based on the diffusion vapour flow theory by philip and de vries 1957 the estimation of vapour transfer in the vadose zone has many challenges due to the lack of field and experimental observations cahill and parlange 1998 reported that there was reasonable agreement between the water vapour flux calculated by the mass transfer equation and the vapour flux calculated by the energy equation however they found that the pdv theory significantly underestimated the magnitude of the vapour flux heitman et al 2008 observed agreement between calculated and measured distributions of the soil water content and temperature however their model predictions were less similar to measured values when the boundary conditions changed drastically i e reversal of the temperature gradient the simulation using a pore scale model showed that conventional models are likely to overestimate vapour transfer in pores shahraeeni and or 2012 novak 2016 reanalysed coupled soil moisture and heat flow using the field measurements of cahill and parlange 1998 and found that the results of cahill and parlange 1998 model were not consistent with those based on philip and de vries 1957 therefore conclusions of cahill and parlange 1998 and parlange et al 1998 both included errors these differences between studies indicate that the current theory of vapour flux does not account for some important physical processes because of the absence of direct experimental studies of vapour transport through porous media therefore it is necessary to further develop the theory of diffusion vapour flow in order to better describe the water vapour transport mechanism in laboratory and field conditions 5 conclusions this paper studied the ejina delta which is mostly covered by the gobi desert to better understand the processes of water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone field experiments were conducted to observe the evolution of the water content and thermal profiles of the soil and the depth of the water table during doys 114 and 212 24 april 31 july 2014 the hydrus 1d model was employed to investigate the mechanisms of liquid water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone the hydrus 1d model accurately simulated the soil moisture and temperature regimes of the desert vadose zone in the extremely arid environment of the study area the soil water and temperatures near the land surface were the lowest and highest respectively for the entire soil profile and both factors exhibited visible daily fluctuations the soil temperature significantly affected the movement of vapour the movement of vapour was the most important component of the total water flux system in the desert vadose zone the thermal vapour flux from the soil temperature gradient comprised almost the total water flux in the desert vadose zone and occurred only in the upper layer of this zone the thermal liquid flux and isothermal water and vapour fluxes approached 0 mm d 1 and could be ignored with respect to the total water flux of the dry soil however the isothermal liquid flux near the land surface that was caused by the matric potential gradient had a significant downward vector 2 3 mm d 1 because of the effect of precipitation therefore the matric potential gradient caused by the precipitation became the main driving factor in the spatio temporal distribution of the liquid water in the soil near the land surface the precipitation also prevented or weakened the vapour flux in the desert vadose zone
