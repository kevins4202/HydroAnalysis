significant knowledge for decision makers on establishing a robust wqmn in surface water during road construction projects keywords water quality monitoring network ccme wqi value of information transinformationentropy nsga ii and nsga iii multi criteria decision making models 1 introduction road construction makes physical chemical and biological impacts on receiving aquatic environments the spatiotemporal impacts of road construction may cause acute alterations vikan and meland 2013 hence it is vital to assess the receiving water quality during road construction water quality monitoring networks wqmn are designed for quantitative data on the spatiotemporal variation of water quality the provided information is applied by decision makers for reliable assessment of water quality and supporting adopted policies for protecting the water resources alfonso and price 2012 behmel et al 2016 the importance of surface water in delivering water demands with adequate quality and the significant economic burden of the monitoring systems necessitates an optimum design of wqmn optimization of wqmn balances the fiscal burden of monitoring networks while a sufficient source of qualitative information is provided alizadeh et al 2018 alilou et al 2019 this optimization will allow decision makers to check deviations from set water quality standards in national and international water regulations pourshahabi et al 2018a maymandi et al 2018 the design of a robust wqmn is still a debatable topic in which the selection of optimal locations for stations is crucial alilou et al 2019 several studies focused on the difficulties in determining the sampling objectives water quality parameters to be monitored location of stations alilou et al 2018 2019 and variations in sampling frequency karamouz et al 2009 zeng et al 2016 khorshidi et al 2018 the optimization process is a key step towards a comprehensive monitoring program in which every element of the existing wqmn is evaluated and the monitoring objectives are met behmel et al 2016 pourshahabi et al 2018b utilizing an optimized monitoring system has been extensively considered in water resources management owing to their better performance compared to opinion and rule based methods khorshidi et al 2018 a review of previous studies indicates the lack of knowledge on the optimization of the wqmn in surface water during road construction hence in this paper two information theoretic techniques including value of information voi and transinformation entropy te were integrally pourshahabi et al 2018a khorshidi et al 2020 used for the optimal design of wqmn in a road construction project information obtained from stations in receiving streams may provide diverse signals with different values to the decision maker therefore an information theory based method the concept of voi was applied to design an optimized wqmn with the highest value for qualitative information from the stations maximum voi which could provide a reasonable view of the whole system on the other hand monitoring networks with the same number of stations but separate locations and comparable voi may bring in a different level of information redundancy thus the te method was employed for minimizing the mutual redundant information in the selected monitoring network as an example the spatial distance of monitoring stations can affect the te level in any pair of potential stations therefore minimizing the te value would in this case result in a monitoring network with a more spatial distribution of monitoring sites and subsequently a better understanding of water quality variations khorshidi et al 2018 very few works have been published using the combination of voi and te in these optimum sensor placement khorshidi et al 2018 and optimum wqmn in reservoirs pourshahabi et al 2018a b maymandi et al 2018 were explored however the lack of an integrated method capable of taking the advantages of both methods in surface water quality is quite apparent also one of the most significant challenges related to the application of information theory in surface water quality monitoring is related to the type of applied data for computing prior and posterior probabilities therefore in this study using the sampling data from the field a hybrid form of information theoretic techniques was proposed for the optimum design of a wqmn in surface water and a road construction project the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii and iii nsga ii and nsga iii were then developed according to three objectives including 1 minimizing the number of monitoring stations 2 minimizing redundant information among monitoring stations and 3 maximizing voi in the selected wqmn finally three different multi criteria decision making mcdm models including technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluations promethee and analytical hierarchy process ahp were used to achieve the best alternative on the pareto optimal solutions the paper contributes to filling the knowledge gap in the following cases which have not been adequately attended in previous assessments 1 computing the prior and posterior probabilities in the information theory based on water quality data from the field sampling and experimental analyses 2 application of the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme water quality index wqi in surface water for optimization of wqmn during the road construction project 3 utilizing nsga iii for optimization of the wqmn in surface water and road project 4 proposing a feasible framework consists of a water quality index an integrated form of information theory techniques efficient optimization and decision making models for monitoring network in surface water the feasibility of the proposed framework was assessed over a 22 km length of a new highway in southern norway 2 material and methods for optimization of the wqmn a six step approach outlined in fig 1 is developed by coding in matlab ver r2016b the first step is to select potential stations based on existing datasets notably the dataset consists of a pre construction monitoring and b monitoring during the construction phase however the methodology is developed based on the latter part including 42 measurements for each station for all stations the water quality index step 2 the value of information step 3 and the transinformation entropy step 4 are calculated thereafter the nsga ii and iii based optimization models were developed step 5 and finally the best solution was chosen using the mcdm models step 6 in the next sub sections the applied methods are explained in more detail 2 1 data collection the study area was the construction site of the new 22 km long highway e18 from arendal to tvedestrand in the southern part of norway fig 2 includes a map of the area the construction area consisted of seven catchments the first digit in the number of stations shows the number of discharge area see fig 2 there are different main streams and side streams that are connected the construction activities e g excavation drilling and blasting transport tunnel and bridge construction and the resulted runoff is the main source of pollution in surface water during road construction several monitoring stations were irregularly established on receiving main streams and side streams to assess spatiotemporal variation of surface water quality due to construction activities fig 2 the location of stations is not dependent on the hydrological aspects in the catchment hence the water flow in these streams and the amount of road construction runoff are not the subjects of the proposed methodology and consequently are not simulated samples for analysis were collected regularly throughout the pre construction 2015 2016 and construction phase 2017 2019 the parameters included general water quality parameters ph alkalinity conductivity fe mn na cl ca mg k al and so₄2 trace elements as ba cd co cr cu ni mo pb hg and zn nutrients nh4 n no3 n total n total p organic matter parameters color chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon particulate matter parameters suspended solids and turbidity and organic micropollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the pah16epa group of the time series from all established stations the stations with relatively complete time series over the total sampling period were selected which are shown by green circles in fig 2 hereafter called potential monitoring stations reference stations which were not affected by road construction activities were not included as potential monitoring stations the red circles in fig 2 show both reference stations and the stations with relatively incomplete time series 2 2 water quality index wqi monitoring programs provide detailed qualitative data including many water quality variables and it is challenging to evaluate the experienced water quality for sensitive aquatic organisms nikoo et al 2011 the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme water quality index wqi see khan et al 2005 and nikoo et al 2011 is a useful management tool for producing a meaningful interpretation of qualitative data i e for evaluation of water quality terrado et al 2010 nikoo et al 2011 munna et al 2013 classification of water quality boyacioglu 2010 nikoo and mahjouri 2013 and water management khan et al 2005 since optimization of wqmn given a specific water quality variable may not be necessarily reliable in terms of other qualitative variables the ccme wqi was utilized to get a more comprehensive view of the water quality in receiving streams the ccme index operates according to different end use objectives and is thereby flexible in selecting suitable parameters nikoo et al 2011 the index allows site specific reference objectives and standards to be integrated into the rankings process khan et al 2005 therefore this index can be developed based on different national water quality criteria and limits nikoo et al 2011 the ccme wqi incorporates three variance values scope frequency and amplitude to achieve the overall water quality state in the form of a unitless number between 0 and 100 there are five categories based on the values of ccme wqi including poor 44 marginal 45 64 fair 65 79 good 80 94 and excellent 95 100 the application of the ccme wqi necessitates water quality guidelines or water quality objectives mahagamage and manage 2014 hence in this study the water quality regulations set by the discharge permit for the construction phase of e18 arendal tvedestrand released by the environment department of agder county norway was applied for every single station see table a1 in this permit regarding the location of stations each one has specific limits for water quality parameters more information related to ccme wqi is presented in appendix 1 the ccme wqi was applied to determine the water quality at the potential monitoring stations based on five categories excellent good fair marginal poor as prior and posterior probabilities and define the value matrix that shows the cost value or damage of decision makers act given the various states in each station 2 3 value of information voi the voi technique was developed by grayson 1960 to evaluate the importance of obtained new information in the decision making process over the past few decades the voi technique has been widely used for time series analysis in water related topics including optimal monitoring network in reservoirs maymandi et al 2018 design of groundwater quality monitoring networks hosseini and kerachian 2017a b designing contamination warning system roberts et al 2009 khorshidi et al 2018 and impact assessment and flood monitoring verkade and werner 2011 alfonso and price 2012 alfonso et al 2016 each monitoring station might have different states e g excellent good fair marginal and poor and can contribute with relevant water quality information message to other stations each message of water quality from each station affects the decision about the state of the system and if it is true or false the message can be of value or damage respectively therefore by measuring at a potential monitoring station prior probabilities could be corrected using baye s theorem the voi theory evaluates the importance of new information and updates the earlier probability p s about the state of a system alfonso and price 2012 pourshahabi et al 2018a in bayes theorem the posterior updated probability considering the new information is represented as eq 1 khorshidi et al 2018 1 p s m p m s p s p m where p s earlier probability for being in state s p m probability for receiving message m given new data p m s conditional probability of receiving the message m when the system is in state s p s m the posterior updated probability for state of system following the delivery of message m given new data when new information appears if the message m from station i is sent for the decision maker to sense the state s in station j the voi of the station i for this process is calculated by eq 2 alfonso and price 2012 2 vo i i j m p m max a s c a s p s m max a s c a s p s where c a s shows the value cost of the action a chosen among available alternatives to coupe up with the state s in the monitoring station j the action a is valued by its distance to the state s the closer it is to s the more valuable the action a is pourshahabi et al 2018a the c a s is defined through the value matrix in which arrays are the differences between the mid values of five categories in ccme wqi see section 2 2 and show the cost value or damage of each action regarding the various states in potential stations the arrays of value matrix have an active role in computing the voi i j hence the matrix should be determined based on a valid standard which in this study is ccmw wqi the applied value matrix is presented in table 1 because all arrays in table 1 show damage they are negative values the rows represent the activities a of decision maker according to their belief about the water quality at the monitoring station and columns indicate the various states of the monitoring station s that may occur for example if the water quality at the station i is in good condition wqi value 80 94 and the mid value of this category is 87 and the decision maker declares it to be poor wqi value 0 44 and the mid value of this category is 22 this wrong decision will lead to 87 22 65 65 units of damage cost in the scale of ccme wqi considerably the arrays on the matrix diameter are set to one instead of zero to keep the probabilities multiplied by the matrix diameters and play their role in voi calculation 2 4 transinformation entropy te the core idea behind the theory of entropy is the evaluation of the information content for a series of data shannon 1948 in this method te quantifies the mutual redundant information between two variables or dataset pourshahabi et al 2018b the entropy method can also predict the probabilities of possible water quality levels at upstream stations based on observed variation in quality levels of a downstream location karamouz et al 2009 different functional forms of this method have also been effectively utilized for qualitative analyses management and network design in groundwater mogheir et al 2009 masoumi and kerachian 2010 owlia et al 2011 mondal and singh 2012 alizadeh and mahjouri 2017 keum et al 2017 hosseini and kerachian 2017a b reservoirs lee et al 2014 nikoo et al 2016a b maymandi et al 2018 rivers jha and singh 2008 karamouz et al 2009 mahjouri and kerachian 2011 memarzadeh et al 2013 pourshahabi et al 2018a b and rainfall and streamflow monitoring networks krstanovic and singh 1992a b stosic et al 2017 a new monitoring station provides more qualitative information and consequently reduces the uncertainty in the water quality evaluation the additional value of each new station may vary however te can show the redundant information in a wqmn which is mainly because of spatiotemporal correlation among the qualitative variables therefore te is efficiently applicable to the optimization of wqmn design karamouz et al 2009 in the proposed framework the concept of te is employed to achieve the amount of mutual information between stations and help to identify essential and unnecessary stations in most of the wqmns many qualitative variables are measured which their time series have non normal asymmetrical probability distribution function and necessitates applying the discrete form of entropy theory for evaluating the efficiency of the monitoring system memarzadeh et al 2013 alizadeh et al 2018 there are different basic ways to measure information according to entropy including marginal joint conditional and transinformation entropies karamouz et al 2009 given a discrete random variable x the marginal entropy is defined by h x as eq 3 3 h x i 1 n p x i l o g p x i where n characterizes the number of events such as x i with the probability of p x i i 1 n the joint total entropy for two independent random variables e g x and y is the probability of accruing both of them simultaneously and expressed as the sum of their marginal entropies 4 h x y h x h y conditional entropy of x given y is the uncertainty remaining in x when y is known and vice versa 5 h x y h x y h y transinformation entropy calculates the mutual redundant information between each pair of stations e g x and y and is calculated by the following equation pourshahabi et al 2018a 2018b khorshidi et al 2020 6 t e x y i 1 n j 1 n p x i y j l n p x i y j p x i p y j where n the number of stations p x i the occurrence probability of x i p y j the occurrence probability of y j p x i y j the joint probability for x i and y j in this study the amount of transformed information was determined for each pair of potential monitoring stations 2 5 optimization models the nsga ii deb et al 2002 algorithm utilizes non dominant sorting and crowded comparison approaches in a single objective form of the genetic algorithm to evaluate variety between non dominatedoptions on the other hand the non dominating sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii is a multi objective algorithm with the basic structure similar to the nsga ii which maintains diversity based on reference points deb and jain 2014 nsga iii does not require additional parameters compare to nsga ii and eliminates the weaknesses of nsga ii considering the lack of uniform diversity and absence of lateral diversity preserving operator among the current best non dominated solutions deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 the nsga ii and iii based optimization models were developed according to the three following objectives i minimizing the number of potential monitoring stations u 1 ii maximizing the voi in the selected network u 2 and iii minimizing redundant information among the selected stations u 3 hence voi and te were determined for all pairs of potential stations in a wqmn and resulted in two square matrices in which the arrays in i th row and j th column define voi i j and te i j respectively accordingly the optimization models were formulated as in eqs 7 10 to achieve an optimal wqmn 7 minimize u 1 i 1 m p ρ i 8 maximize u 2 j max i ρ i v o i i j 9 minimize u 3 i 1 m p j i t e i j t e m i n i t e m a x i t e m i n i 10 i 1 m p ρ i m opt where u i the values for the utility functions of the objectives m opt the optimized number of monitoring stations m p the number of potential monitoring stations ρ i binary variable 0ifpotential station i isnot selected as a monitoring station otherwise1 voi i j value of information in i th station for detecting the state of j th monitoring station te i j the transinformation entropy between station i and station j te m i n i j the minimum transinformation entropy between station i and other stations te m a x i j the maximum transinformation entropy between station i and other stations the characteristics of the best structure for the nsga ii and iii algorithms including population size and the number of generations were achieved over a sensitivity analysis the optimization models deliver the pareto front trade off curve between objectives alizadeh et al 2017 ghorbani mooselu et al 2020 which consists of the right answers for the optimization problem so the mcdms next paragraph are required for the decision maker to get the best solution 2 6 multi criteria decision making models in this study three mcdm models including topsis hwang and yoon 1981 promethee mareschal et al 1984 and ahp saaty 1988 were utilized to reach the best wqmn among the alternatives on the trade off curve besides to evaluate the effects of weighing scenarios on results different weighting scenarios were assigned to objectives by experts topsis model attends the alternatives distance from ideal and negative ideal solutions which both are achieved by normalizing the alternatives in the decision matrix and then weighing them based on the assigned weights to decision criteria the best solution in this method has the lowest distance from the ideal solution mooselu et al 2019 also promethee as a flexible and straightforward decision making model is extensively applied in water resources management kuang et al 2015 pourshahabi et al 2018a sapkota et al 2018 mooselu et al 2019 promethee focuses on pairwise comparison in the ranking process in this study complete ranking promethee ii was employed which ranks a set of alternatives a a 1 a 2 a n given a set of criteria z z 1 z 2 z m in four steps zhang et al 2009 first the weighting of the criteria by expert s opinions that show their relative importance compared to one another then preference function is adopted that conveys the priority of each pair of alternatives e g a i a j in comparison to each other based on a single criterion such as z i in this study the v shape with indifference preference function was utilized which provides a sensible pairwise comparison between alternatives in the third step for any pair in the set of alternatives a the global preference index π a i a j is defined and indicates the preference of a i over a j the higher value for π o i o j the more preference of a i compared to a j in the final step named outranking flows for ranking the a i among other alternatives in the set of alternatives a the positive outranking flow or φ a i the values of preference of a i and negative outranking flow or φ a i not preferring of a i over the other alternatives have to be computed the alternative with the highest value of the net outranking flow φ a i φ a i φ a i is selected as the best solution more applications and information about promethee are provided by pourshahabi et al 2018a mooselu et al 2019 ahp is a suitable method for multi objective analyses in discrete mode which can enter qualitative and quantitative factors criteria in the decision model it derives priorities among criteria and alternatives and simplifies preference ratings among decision criteria using pairwise comparisons saaty 1988 the basic procedure in ahp consists of three steps including 1 developing the scores for each decision alternative for each criterion 2 determining the weights of criteria and 3 calculating the weighted average rating for each decision alternative the details of ahp is presented in saaty 1988 3 results and discussion the ccme wqi was computed for all potential monitoring stations and for all time steps during the construction period 2017 2019 the states of the potential monitoring stations in two different random time steps are presented in fig 3 this figure clearly shows that a single station could have different states in various time steps depending on different reasons such as weather situation e g sampling conducted after a rain episode or after a longer dry period and the type of activity being performed at the station hence these issues will affect the water quality and consequently the prior probabilities resulting from ccme wqi given the five categories in ccme wqi poor marginal fair good excellent the value matrix was calculated which is highly influential on the final results of the voi method accordingly voi and te were computed for all pairs of the potential monitoring stations and the results were two square matrices 44 44 of voi i j and te i j fig 4 a provides a graphical interpretation for voi i j in which the normalized values of voi in station 4 4 voi 4 4 j for detecting the state of all other potential monitoring stations is mapped besides fig 4b demonstrates the redundancy of information given station 4 4 against all other potential monitoring stations te 4 4 j fig 4 clearly shows the concept of spatial distribution for te and voi given each monitoring station here station 4 4 te i j is measured between an origin station i and a goal station j and shows that how much information from station j is achievable by the station i the closer the values of normalized te i j to 1 the more accessible the information of the station j through station i by moving away from station 4 4 the voi obtained from this station to determine the quality status of other stations will be reduced the spatial distribution of te in station 4 4 shows that for other stations in the same catchment area e g 4 1 4 2 4 21 and 4 3 the amount of mutual information is more than other stations after that running the optimization models for three objectives led to the trade off curves composed of 27 and 18 optimal solutions for nsga ii and nsga iii which are the best match for the selected objectives fig 5 nsga ii uses crowding distance to keep uniform coverage of pareto solutions while nsga iii takes advantage of the reference point mechanism as its selection operator to look at the solution space and preserve diversity deb and jain 2014 comparing the results of the optimization models the nsga ii based optimization model provides optimal solutions with higher voi and broader range for the number of stations in the wqmn in contrast nsga iii based optimization model delivers more solutions with a minimum value of redundant information from a decision making perspective it seems that nsga ii is more applicable since it can offer more optimized alternatives to decision makers the values of normalized transinformation entropy in some of the optimal solutions both nsga ii and iii were zero it is mainly because the third objective function of the optimization model is defined to minimize the summation of the normalized te values between the selected stations in the optimized network eq 9 consequently by selecting the minimum values for te i j the final value of this objective function would be zero therefore the optimal solutions selected set of stations meet the objective of the problem minimizing the redundancy between stations however the outlier point in the pareto front of nsga ii model shows the optimal solutions that have a different value of te i j both optimization models showed acceptable performance by providing the solutions that meet the selected criteria the optimum alternative on the pareto front space was obtained by three different mcdm models including topsis promethee and ahp for different weighing scenarios which are assigned to criteria based on experts opinions in fact the weighting scenarios show the priority of objectives in order to achieve optimum wqmn table 2 shows various weighing scenarios and corresponding solutions selected by topsis and promethee models due to te values in optimal solutions which in the majority of the optimal solution is zero and shows the high performance of the model in minimizing the transinformation entropy inmostofthelisted weighing scenarios the assigned weight to this objective was adopted less than other two objectives as can be seen for the results of the nsga ii if the objective function 1 number of monitoring stations receives more importance e g weighing scenarios of 7 8 and 9 topsis selects solution 14 with 33 monitoring stations while promethee and ahp pick three different solutions when the first and third objective functions have the same importance e g weighing scenarios of 3 4 6 and 10 promethee and ahp certainly chose the solution 18 with 28 monitoring stations and topsis has two different choices solutions 14 and 4 if the experts prioritize the voi as the most significant objective e g weighing scenarios of 1 2 and 5 all mcdm models deliver different solutions depending on the assigned weights finally solution 14 and 18 were recognized as the preferable solutions by mcdm models respectively for the pareto optimal solutions of the nsga iii based optimization model the performance of mcdms was different from that for the nsga ii based model in most of the weighing scenarios topsis selected solution 1 with 30 stations in the network while promethee as well as ahp picked the solution 9 with 29 stations the objective values in the selected solutions are presented in table 3 the selected solutions provided the optimum wqmn during road construction with the optimum number of stations and minimum redundant information among stations while maximizing the value of information for the monitoring stations in wqmn this network facilitates the situation for decision makers to update their judgment about the quality of water in the road construction area as an example the selected wqmns from the solutions of the nsga ii model solutions 14 and 18 are presented in fig 6 it is vivid that both wqmns have a reasonable spatial distribution over the seven catchment areas which provides a reliable evaluation of the impact of road construction activities on receiving streams however the reference stations were not considered in selected stations and only affected potential stations were attended in order to analyze the selected solutions based on provided voi and te the union of the voi i curves in the selected wqmns and te among the selected stations in both optimum solutions 14 and 18 are presented in fig 7 a b and fig 7c d respectively the best state of the monitoring system regarding the value of information is achieved by having all the potential stations in the final wqmn maximizing the value of voi guarantees that the selected wqmn with fewer stations is approached to having the monitoring station in all potential points however the locations of the selected stations could have different distributions therefore minimizing the te secures that the selected stations have the best spatial distribution over the catchment areas as shown both solutions have almost the same status in satisfying the objectives voi i and te consequently the same situation given voi i and te provides a suitable condition for the decision maker to confidently select the best solution based on the number of stations hence solution 18 with 28 stations distributed in all seven catchment areas is the final wqmn with the same logic for the selected wqmns from the nsga iii solution 9 with 29 well distributed stations is the ultimate solution the optimized wqmns are the cost effective solutions with fewer monitoring stations in comparison with the current monitoring program while provides reliable information on the water quality along the construction site 4 summary and conclusion this study proposed an applicable methodology for spatial multi objective optimization of wqmn during a road construction project included are the ccme wqi the information theoretic approaches voi and te nsga ii and iii and mcdm models the approach was applied to a monitoring program consisting of 44 potential monitoring stations in seven catchment areas which received runoff from the construction of a 22 km long e18 highway in southern norway ccme wqi was determined considering qualitative parameters in the time series dataset over the construction period there were three main objectives including i minimizing the number of monitoring stations ii maximizing the value of information among stations and iii minimizing te redundant information in the selected wqmn accordingly the nsga ii and nsga iii based optimization models were utilized to achieve the pareto front of optimal solutions then given different weighting scenarios selected by experts opinion for objective functions the best solution was found using the topsis promethee and ahp multi criteria decision making methods the application of the proposed methodology for optimizing wqmn during road construction provides feasible knowledge regarding the surface water quality and contributes to filling the information gap in utilizing ccme wqi a hybrid voi te method and nsga iii for optimization of the wqmn during the road construction project the resulting extent of measurements has minimum redundancy and maximum value for the decision making process having optimized the spatial part of wqmn the distribution of monitoring stations a temporal optimization and selection of an optimal sampling frequency could be the next steps besides the bayesian maximum entropy bme method hosseini and kerachian 2017a b can be applied to get a reliable spatiotemporal fit of wqi also the uncertainty in determining the wqi could be analyzed by interval number programming nikoo et al 2013 nikoo et al 2016a b ccme wqi needs the same time series for all qualitative parameters in each assessment which in practice leads to a decrease in the number of parameters examined hence the results of this study using the ccme index could be compared with other water quality indices such as the eu water framework directive wfd or leachate pollution index lpi credit authorship contribution statement mehrdad

methodology for spatial optimization of the water quality monitoring network wqmn in surface water during road construction using the field data first using the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme method the water quality index wqi was computed in each potential monitoring station during construction then the integrated form of the information theoretic techniques consists of the transinformation entropy te and the value of information voi were calculated for the potential stations to achieve the optimal wqmns the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii and iii nsga ii

significant knowledge for decision makers on establishing a robust wqmn in surface water during road construction projects keywords water quality monitoring network ccme wqi value of information transinformationentropy nsga ii and nsga iii multi criteria decision making models 1 introduction road construction makes physical chemical and biological impacts on receiving aquatic environments the spatiotemporal impacts of road construction may cause acute alterations vikan and meland 2013 hence it is vital to assess the receiving water quality during road construction water quality monitoring networks wqmn are designed for quantitative data on the spatiotemporal variation of water quality the provided information is applied by decision makers for reliable assessment of water quality and supporting adopted policies for protecting the water resources alfonso and price 2012 behmel et al 2016 the importance of surface water in delivering water demands with adequate quality and the significant economic burden of the monitoring systems necessitates an optimum design of wqmn optimization of wqmn balances the fiscal burden of monitoring networks while a sufficient source of qualitative information is provided alizadeh et al 2018 alilou et al 2019 this optimization will allow decision makers to check deviations from set water quality standards in national and international water regulations pourshahabi et al 2018a maymandi et al 2018 the design of a robust wqmn is still a debatable topic in which the selection of optimal locations for stations is crucial alilou et al 2019 several studies focused on the difficulties in determining the sampling objectives water quality parameters to be monitored location of stations alilou et al 2018 2019 and variations in sampling frequency karamouz et al 2009 zeng et al 2016 khorshidi et al 2018 the optimization process is a key step towards a comprehensive monitoring program in which every element of the existing wqmn is evaluated and the monitoring objectives are met behmel et al 2016 pourshahabi et al 2018b utilizing an optimized monitoring system has been extensively considered in water resources management owing to their better performance compared to opinion and rule based methods khorshidi et al 2018 a review of previous studies indicates the lack of knowledge on the optimization of the wqmn in surface water during road construction hence in this paper two information theoretic techniques including value of information voi and transinformation entropy te were integrally pourshahabi et al 2018a khorshidi et al 2020 used for the optimal design of wqmn in a road construction project information obtained from stations in receiving streams may provide diverse signals with different values to the decision maker therefore an information theory based method the concept of voi was applied to design an optimized wqmn with the highest value for qualitative information from the stations maximum voi which could provide a reasonable view of the whole system on the other hand monitoring networks with the same number of stations but separate locations and comparable voi may bring in a different level of information redundancy thus the te method was employed for minimizing the mutual redundant information in the selected monitoring network as an example the spatial distance of monitoring stations can affect the te level in any pair of potential stations therefore minimizing the te value would in this case result in a monitoring network with a more spatial distribution of monitoring sites and subsequently a better understanding of water quality variations khorshidi et al 2018 very few works have been published using the combination of voi and te in these optimum sensor placement khorshidi et al 2018 and optimum wqmn in reservoirs pourshahabi et al 2018a b maymandi et al 2018 were explored however the lack of an integrated method capable of taking the advantages of both methods in surface water quality is quite apparent also one of the most significant challenges related to the application of information theory in surface water quality monitoring is related to the type of applied data for computing prior and posterior probabilities therefore in this study using the sampling data from the field a hybrid form of information theoretic techniques was proposed for the optimum design of a wqmn in surface water and a road construction project the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii and iii nsga ii and nsga iii were then developed according to three objectives including 1 minimizing the number of monitoring stations 2 minimizing redundant information among monitoring stations and 3 maximizing voi in the selected wqmn finally three different multi criteria decision making mcdm models including technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluations promethee and analytical hierarchy process ahp were used to achieve the best alternative on the pareto optimal solutions the paper contributes to filling the knowledge gap in the following cases which have not been adequately attended in previous assessments 1 computing the prior and posterior probabilities in the information theory based on water quality data from the field sampling and experimental analyses 2 application of the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme water quality index wqi in surface water for optimization of wqmn during the road construction project 3 utilizing nsga iii for optimization of the wqmn in surface water and road project 4 proposing a feasible framework consists of a water quality index an integrated form of information theory techniques efficient optimization and decision making models for monitoring network in surface water the feasibility of the proposed framework was assessed over a 22 km length of a new highway in southern norway 2 material and methods for optimization of the wqmn a six step approach outlined in fig 1 is developed by coding in matlab ver r2016b the first step is to select potential stations based on existing datasets notably the dataset consists of a pre construction monitoring and b monitoring during the construction phase however the methodology is developed based on the latter part including 42 measurements for each station for all stations the water quality index step 2 the value of information step 3 and the transinformation entropy step 4 are calculated thereafter the nsga ii and iii based optimization models were developed step 5 and finally the best solution was chosen using the mcdm models step 6 in the next sub sections the applied methods are explained in more detail 2 1 data collection the study area was the construction site of the new 22 km long highway e18 from arendal to tvedestrand in the southern part of norway fig 2 includes a map of the area the construction area consisted of seven catchments the first digit in the number of stations shows the number of discharge area see fig 2 there are different main streams and side streams that are connected the construction activities e g excavation drilling and blasting transport tunnel and bridge construction and the resulted runoff is the main source of pollution in surface water during road construction several monitoring stations were irregularly established on receiving main streams and side streams to assess spatiotemporal variation of surface water quality due to construction activities fig 2 the location of stations is not dependent on the hydrological aspects in the catchment hence the water flow in these streams and the amount of road construction runoff are not the subjects of the proposed methodology and consequently are not simulated samples for analysis were collected regularly throughout the pre construction 2015 2016 and construction phase 2017 2019 the parameters included general water quality parameters ph alkalinity conductivity fe mn na cl ca mg k al and so₄2 trace elements as ba cd co cr cu ni mo pb hg and zn nutrients nh4 n no3 n total n total p organic matter parameters color chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon particulate matter parameters suspended solids and turbidity and organic micropollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the pah16epa group of the time series from all established stations the stations with relatively complete time series over the total sampling period were selected which are shown by green circles in fig 2 hereafter called potential monitoring stations reference stations which were not affected by road construction activities were not included as potential monitoring stations the red circles in fig 2 show both reference stations and the stations with relatively incomplete time series 2 2 water quality index wqi monitoring programs provide detailed qualitative data including many water quality variables and it is challenging to evaluate the experienced water quality for sensitive aquatic organisms nikoo et al 2011 the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme water quality index wqi see khan et al 2005 and nikoo et al 2011 is a useful management tool for producing a meaningful interpretation of qualitative data i e for evaluation of water quality terrado et al 2010 nikoo et al 2011 munna et al 2013 classification of water quality boyacioglu 2010 nikoo and mahjouri 2013 and water management khan et al 2005 since optimization of wqmn given a specific water quality variable may not be necessarily reliable in terms of other qualitative variables the ccme wqi was utilized to get a more comprehensive view of the water quality in receiving streams the ccme index operates according to different end use objectives and is thereby flexible in selecting suitable parameters nikoo et al 2011 the index allows site specific reference objectives and standards to be integrated into the rankings process khan et al 2005 therefore this index can be developed based on different national water quality criteria and limits nikoo et al 2011 the ccme wqi incorporates three variance values scope frequency and amplitude to achieve the overall water quality state in the form of a unitless number between 0 and 100 there are five categories based on the values of ccme wqi including poor 44 marginal 45 64 fair 65 79 good 80 94 and excellent 95 100 the application of the ccme wqi necessitates water quality guidelines or water quality objectives mahagamage and manage 2014 hence in this study the water quality regulations set by the discharge permit for the construction phase of e18 arendal tvedestrand released by the environment department of agder county norway was applied for every single station see table a1 in this permit regarding the location of stations each one has specific limits for water quality parameters more information related to ccme wqi is presented in appendix 1 the ccme wqi was applied to determine the water quality at the potential monitoring stations based on five categories excellent good fair marginal poor as prior and posterior probabilities and define the value matrix that shows the cost value or damage of decision makers act given the various states in each station 2 3 value of information voi the voi technique was developed by grayson 1960 to evaluate the importance of obtained new information in the decision making process over the past few decades the voi technique has been widely used for time series analysis in water related topics including optimal monitoring network in reservoirs maymandi et al 2018 design of groundwater quality monitoring networks hosseini and kerachian 2017a b designing contamination warning system roberts et al 2009 khorshidi et al 2018 and impact assessment and flood monitoring verkade and werner 2011 alfonso and price 2012 alfonso et al 2016 each monitoring station might have different states e g excellent good fair marginal and poor and can contribute with relevant water quality information message to other stations each message of water quality from each station affects the decision about the state of the system and if it is true or false the message can be of value or damage respectively therefore by measuring at a potential monitoring station prior probabilities could be corrected using baye s theorem the voi theory evaluates the importance of new information and updates the earlier probability p s about the state of a system alfonso and price 2012 pourshahabi et al 2018a in bayes theorem the posterior updated probability considering the new information is represented as eq 1 khorshidi et al 2018 1 p s m p m s p s p m where p s earlier probability for being in state s p m probability for receiving message m given new data p m s conditional probability of receiving the message m when the system is in state s p s m the posterior updated probability for state of system following the delivery of message m given new data when new information appears if the message m from station i is sent for the decision maker to sense the state s in station j the voi of the station i for this process is calculated by eq 2 alfonso and price 2012 2 vo i i j m p m max a s c a s p s m max a s c a s p s where c a s shows the value cost of the action a chosen among available alternatives to coupe up with the state s in the monitoring station j the action a is valued by its distance to the state s the closer it is to s the more valuable the action a is pourshahabi et al 2018a the c a s is defined through the value matrix in which arrays are the differences between the mid values of five categories in ccme wqi see section 2 2 and show the cost value or damage of each action regarding the various states in potential stations the arrays of value matrix have an active role in computing the voi i j hence the matrix should be determined based on a valid standard which in this study is ccmw wqi the applied value matrix is presented in table 1 because all arrays in table 1 show damage they are negative values the rows represent the activities a of decision maker according to their belief about the water quality at the monitoring station and columns indicate the various states of the monitoring station s that may occur for example if the water quality at the station i is in good condition wqi value 80 94 and the mid value of this category is 87 and the decision maker declares it to be poor wqi value 0 44 and the mid value of this category is 22 this wrong decision will lead to 87 22 65 65 units of damage cost in the scale of ccme wqi considerably the arrays on the matrix diameter are set to one instead of zero to keep the probabilities multiplied by the matrix diameters and play their role in voi calculation 2 4 transinformation entropy te the core idea behind the theory of entropy is the evaluation of the information content for a series of data shannon 1948 in this method te quantifies the mutual redundant information between two variables or dataset pourshahabi et al 2018b the entropy method can also predict the probabilities of possible water quality levels at upstream stations based on observed variation in quality levels of a downstream location karamouz et al 2009 different functional forms of this method have also been effectively utilized for qualitative analyses management and network design in groundwater mogheir et al 2009 masoumi and kerachian 2010 owlia et al 2011 mondal and singh 2012 alizadeh and mahjouri 2017 keum et al 2017 hosseini and kerachian 2017a b reservoirs lee et al 2014 nikoo et al 2016a b maymandi et al 2018 rivers jha and singh 2008 karamouz et al 2009 mahjouri and kerachian 2011 memarzadeh et al 2013 pourshahabi et al 2018a b and rainfall and streamflow monitoring networks krstanovic and singh 1992a b stosic et al 2017 a new monitoring station provides more qualitative information and consequently reduces the uncertainty in the water quality evaluation the additional value of each new station may vary however te can show the redundant information in a wqmn which is mainly because of spatiotemporal correlation among the qualitative variables therefore te is efficiently applicable to the optimization of wqmn design karamouz et al 2009 in the proposed framework the concept of te is employed to achieve the amount of mutual information between stations and help to identify essential and unnecessary stations in most of the wqmns many qualitative variables are measured which their time series have non normal asymmetrical probability distribution function and necessitates applying the discrete form of entropy theory for evaluating the efficiency of the monitoring system memarzadeh et al 2013 alizadeh et al 2018 there are different basic ways to measure information according to entropy including marginal joint conditional and transinformation entropies karamouz et al 2009 given a discrete random variable x the marginal entropy is defined by h x as eq 3 3 h x i 1 n p x i l o g p x i where n characterizes the number of events such as x i with the probability of p x i i 1 n the joint total entropy for two independent random variables e g x and y is the probability of accruing both of them simultaneously and expressed as the sum of their marginal entropies 4 h x y h x h y conditional entropy of x given y is the uncertainty remaining in x when y is known and vice versa 5 h x y h x y h y transinformation entropy calculates the mutual redundant information between each pair of stations e g x and y and is calculated by the following equation pourshahabi et al 2018a 2018b khorshidi et al 2020 6 t e x y i 1 n j 1 n p x i y j l n p x i y j p x i p y j where n the number of stations p x i the occurrence probability of x i p y j the occurrence probability of y j p x i y j the joint probability for x i and y j in this study the amount of transformed information was determined for each pair of potential monitoring stations 2 5 optimization models the nsga ii deb et al 2002 algorithm utilizes non dominant sorting and crowded comparison approaches in a single objective form of the genetic algorithm to evaluate variety between non dominatedoptions on the other hand the non dominating sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii is a multi objective algorithm with the basic structure similar to the nsga ii which maintains diversity based on reference points deb and jain 2014 nsga iii does not require additional parameters compare to nsga ii and eliminates the weaknesses of nsga ii considering the lack of uniform diversity and absence of lateral diversity preserving operator among the current best non dominated solutions deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 the nsga ii and iii based optimization models were developed according to the three following objectives i minimizing the number of potential monitoring stations u 1 ii maximizing the voi in the selected network u 2 and iii minimizing redundant information among the selected stations u 3 hence voi and te were determined for all pairs of potential stations in a wqmn and resulted in two square matrices in which the arrays in i th row and j th column define voi i j and te i j respectively accordingly the optimization models were formulated as in eqs 7 10 to achieve an optimal wqmn 7 minimize u 1 i 1 m p ρ i 8 maximize u 2 j max i ρ i v o i i j 9 minimize u 3 i 1 m p j i t e i j t e m i n i t e m a x i t e m i n i 10 i 1 m p ρ i m opt where u i the values for the utility functions of the objectives m opt the optimized number of monitoring stations m p the number of potential monitoring stations ρ i binary variable 0ifpotential station i isnot selected as a monitoring station otherwise1 voi i j value of information in i th station for detecting the state of j th monitoring station te i j the transinformation entropy between station i and station j te m i n i j the minimum transinformation entropy between station i and other stations te m a x i j the maximum transinformation entropy between station i and other stations the characteristics of the best structure for the nsga ii and iii algorithms including population size and the number of generations were achieved over a sensitivity analysis the optimization models deliver the pareto front trade off curve between objectives alizadeh et al 2017 ghorbani mooselu et al 2020 which consists of the right answers for the optimization problem so the mcdms next paragraph are required for the decision maker to get the best solution 2 6 multi criteria decision making models in this study three mcdm models including topsis hwang and yoon 1981 promethee mareschal et al 1984 and ahp saaty 1988 were utilized to reach the best wqmn among the alternatives on the trade off curve besides to evaluate the effects of weighing scenarios on results different weighting scenarios were assigned to objectives by experts topsis model attends the alternatives distance from ideal and negative ideal solutions which both are achieved by normalizing the alternatives in the decision matrix and then weighing them based on the assigned weights to decision criteria the best solution in this method has the lowest distance from the ideal solution mooselu et al 2019 also promethee as a flexible and straightforward decision making model is extensively applied in water resources management kuang et al 2015 pourshahabi et al 2018a sapkota et al 2018 mooselu et al 2019 promethee focuses on pairwise comparison in the ranking process in this study complete ranking promethee ii was employed which ranks a set of alternatives a a 1 a 2 a n given a set of criteria z z 1 z 2 z m in four steps zhang et al 2009 first the weighting of the criteria by expert s opinions that show their relative importance compared to one another then preference function is adopted that conveys the priority of each pair of alternatives e g a i a j in comparison to each other based on a single criterion such as z i in this study the v shape with indifference preference function was utilized which provides a sensible pairwise comparison between alternatives in the third step for any pair in the set of alternatives a the global preference index π a i a j is defined and indicates the preference of a i over a j the higher value for π o i o j the more preference of a i compared to a j in the final step named outranking flows for ranking the a i among other alternatives in the set of alternatives a the positive outranking flow or φ a i the values of preference of a i and negative outranking flow or φ a i not preferring of a i over the other alternatives have to be computed the alternative with the highest value of the net outranking flow φ a i φ a i φ a i is selected as the best solution more applications and information about promethee are provided by pourshahabi et al 2018a mooselu et al 2019 ahp is a suitable method for multi objective analyses in discrete mode which can enter qualitative and quantitative factors criteria in the decision model it derives priorities among criteria and alternatives and simplifies preference ratings among decision criteria using pairwise comparisons saaty 1988 the basic procedure in ahp consists of three steps including 1 developing the scores for each decision alternative for each criterion 2 determining the weights of criteria and 3 calculating the weighted average rating for each decision alternative the details of ahp is presented in saaty 1988 3 results and discussion the ccme wqi was computed for all potential monitoring stations and for all time steps during the construction period 2017 2019 the states of the potential monitoring stations in two different random time steps are presented in fig 3 this figure clearly shows that a single station could have different states in various time steps depending on different reasons such as weather situation e g sampling conducted after a rain episode or after a longer dry period and the type of activity being performed at the station hence these issues will affect the water quality and consequently the prior probabilities resulting from ccme wqi given the five categories in ccme wqi poor marginal fair good excellent the value matrix was calculated which is highly influential on the final results of the voi method accordingly voi and te were computed for all pairs of the potential monitoring stations and the results were two square matrices 44 44 of voi i j and te i j fig 4 a provides a graphical interpretation for voi i j in which the normalized values of voi in station 4 4 voi 4 4 j for detecting the state of all other potential monitoring stations is mapped besides fig 4b demonstrates the redundancy of information given station 4 4 against all other potential monitoring stations te 4 4 j fig 4 clearly shows the concept of spatial distribution for te and voi given each monitoring station here station 4 4 te i j is measured between an origin station i and a goal station j and shows that how much information from station j is achievable by the station i the closer the values of normalized te i j to 1 the more accessible the information of the station j through station i by moving away from station 4 4 the voi obtained from this station to determine the quality status of other stations will be reduced the spatial distribution of te in station 4 4 shows that for other stations in the same catchment area e g 4 1 4 2 4 21 and 4 3 the amount of mutual information is more than other stations after that running the optimization models for three objectives led to the trade off curves composed of 27 and 18 optimal solutions for nsga ii and nsga iii which are the best match for the selected objectives fig 5 nsga ii uses crowding distance to keep uniform coverage of pareto solutions while nsga iii takes advantage of the reference point mechanism as its selection operator to look at the solution space and preserve diversity deb and jain 2014 comparing the results of the optimization models the nsga ii based optimization model provides optimal solutions with higher voi and broader range for the number of stations in the wqmn in contrast nsga iii based optimization model delivers more solutions with a minimum value of redundant information from a decision making perspective it seems that nsga ii is more applicable since it can offer more optimized alternatives to decision makers the values of normalized transinformation entropy in some of the optimal solutions both nsga ii and iii were zero it is mainly because the third objective function of the optimization model is defined to minimize the summation of the normalized te values between the selected stations in the optimized network eq 9 consequently by selecting the minimum values for te i j the final value of this objective function would be zero therefore the optimal solutions selected set of stations meet the objective of the problem minimizing the redundancy between stations however the outlier point in the pareto front of nsga ii model shows the optimal solutions that have a different value of te i j both optimization models showed acceptable performance by providing the solutions that meet the selected criteria the optimum alternative on the pareto front space was obtained by three different mcdm models including topsis promethee and ahp for different weighing scenarios which are assigned to criteria based on experts opinions in fact the weighting scenarios show the priority of objectives in order to achieve optimum wqmn table 2 shows various weighing scenarios and corresponding solutions selected by topsis and promethee models due to te values in optimal solutions which in the majority of the optimal solution is zero and shows the high performance of the model in minimizing the transinformation entropy inmostofthelisted weighing scenarios the assigned weight to this objective was adopted less than other two objectives as can be seen for the results of the nsga ii if the objective function 1 number of monitoring stations receives more importance e g weighing scenarios of 7 8 and 9 topsis selects solution 14 with 33 monitoring stations while promethee and ahp pick three different solutions when the first and third objective functions have the same importance e g weighing scenarios of 3 4 6 and 10 promethee and ahp certainly chose the solution 18 with 28 monitoring stations and topsis has two different choices solutions 14 and 4 if the experts prioritize the voi as the most significant objective e g weighing scenarios of 1 2 and 5 all mcdm models deliver different solutions depending on the assigned weights finally solution 14 and 18 were recognized as the preferable solutions by mcdm models respectively for the pareto optimal solutions of the nsga iii based optimization model the performance of mcdms was different from that for the nsga ii based model in most of the weighing scenarios topsis selected solution 1 with 30 stations in the network while promethee as well as ahp picked the solution 9 with 29 stations the objective values in the selected solutions are presented in table 3 the selected solutions provided the optimum wqmn during road construction with the optimum number of stations and minimum redundant information among stations while maximizing the value of information for the monitoring stations in wqmn this network facilitates the situation for decision makers to update their judgment about the quality of water in the road construction area as an example the selected wqmns from the solutions of the nsga ii model solutions 14 and 18 are presented in fig 6 it is vivid that both wqmns have a reasonable spatial distribution over the seven catchment areas which provides a reliable evaluation of the impact of road construction activities on receiving streams however the reference stations were not considered in selected stations and only affected potential stations were attended in order to analyze the selected solutions based on provided voi and te the union of the voi i curves in the selected wqmns and te among the selected stations in both optimum solutions 14 and 18 are presented in fig 7 a b and fig 7c d respectively the best state of the monitoring system regarding the value of information is achieved by having all the potential stations in the final wqmn maximizing the value of voi guarantees that the selected wqmn with fewer stations is approached to having the monitoring station in all potential points however the locations of the selected stations could have different distributions therefore minimizing the te secures that the selected stations have the best spatial distribution over the catchment areas as shown both solutions have almost the same status in satisfying the objectives voi i and te consequently the same situation given voi i and te provides a suitable condition for the decision maker to confidently select the best solution based on the number of stations hence solution 18 with 28 stations distributed in all seven catchment areas is the final wqmn with the same logic for the selected wqmns from the nsga iii solution 9 with 29 well distributed stations is the ultimate solution the optimized wqmns are the cost effective solutions with fewer monitoring stations in comparison with the current monitoring program while provides reliable information on the water quality along the construction site 4 summary and conclusion this study proposed an applicable methodology for spatial multi objective optimization of wqmn during a road construction project included are the ccme wqi the information theoretic approaches voi and te nsga ii and iii and mcdm models the approach was applied to a monitoring program consisting of 44 potential monitoring stations in seven catchment areas which received runoff from the construction of a 22 km long e18 highway in southern norway ccme wqi was determined considering qualitative parameters in the time series dataset over the construction period there were three main objectives including i minimizing the number of monitoring stations ii maximizing the value of information among stations and iii minimizing te redundant information in the selected wqmn accordingly the nsga ii and nsga iii based optimization models were utilized to achieve the pareto front of optimal solutions then given different weighting scenarios selected by experts opinion for objective functions the best solution was found using the topsis promethee and ahp multi criteria decision making methods the application of the proposed methodology for optimizing wqmn during road construction provides feasible knowledge regarding the surface water quality and contributes to filling the information gap in utilizing ccme wqi a hybrid voi te method and nsga iii for optimization of the wqmn during the road construction project the resulting extent of measurements has minimum redundancy and maximum value for the decision making process having optimized the spatial part of wqmn the distribution of monitoring stations a temporal optimization and selection of an optimal sampling frequency could be the next steps besides the bayesian maximum entropy bme method hosseini and kerachian 2017a b can be applied to get a reliable spatiotemporal fit of wqi also the uncertainty in determining the wqi could be analyzed by interval number programming nikoo et al 2013 nikoo et al 2016a b ccme wqi needs the same time series for all qualitative parameters in each assessment which in practice leads to a decrease in the number of parameters examined hence the results of this study using the ccme index could be compared with other water quality indices such as the eu water framework directive wfd or leachate pollution index lpi credit authorship contribution statement mehrdad

and incurring us 46 billion in economic losses in this paper we re evaluate the flood event to identify the root source of the catastrophe by analyzing hydrological data from gauge stations along the chao phraya river cpr and remote sensing data we decoupled the volumetric contributions of river overflow and local rainfall to the lowland reach of the basin and found that the latter contributed most to the flooding more specifically out of the total of 77 6 km3 of floodwaters estimated 73 7 was from precipitation while only 26 3 was from river discharges this finding differs from the official reports or previous studies which attributed the main cause of the river overbank flow therefore it is also inferred that the upstream dam operations would have been only marginally helpful in mitigating the flood since rainfall made up most of the floodwaters in the downstream reach of the river our finding offers a new perspective that the local rainfall could be a significant source of the floodwater rather than river overflow in the lower reaches of a large monsoonal river system in southeast asia thus this paper contributes to the understanding of complex flood processes in large river basins and provides fresh insights for efficient flood control and stormwater management keywords flood natural disaster river rainfall inundation thailand southeast asia 1 introduction one of the greatest floods in thai history occurred in 2011 between august and december with an estimated floodwater volume of around 15 billion m3 komori et al 2012 rakwatin et al 2013 this major disaster resulted in 813 casualties and three missing people world bank 2012 the flood covered a spatial extent of approximately 97 000 km2 which is around 4 of the country and affected over 66 out of the 77 provinces in thailand it also destroyed more than 1 8 million homes and displaced 2 5 million people in 6 months august to january 2012 dhi 2012 aon benfield 2012 although these statistics do not rank amongst the top ten global floods that have been reported since 1982 this flooding event surpasses these flood events in terms of economic damages which totalled up to approximately us 45 5 billion hence it is one of the most catastrophic and costliest in land flood disasters recorded in modern history world bank 2012 poosuwan 2020 this is evident from how thailand s economic growth in 2011 drastically dropped from 3 7 to 0 1 which was primarily due to the losses in physical assets products raw materials machinery and shelters bidorn et al 2015 previous studies which attempted to investigate the 2011 catastrophe in thailand include international journal articles e g komori et al 2012 poapongsakorn and meethom 2012 rakwatin et al 2013 haraguchi and lall 2015 technical reports from international organizations e g aon benfield 2012 2 ministry of agriculture and cooperatives japan international cooperation agency jica 2013 or individual experts meehan 2012 and local reports in thais such as thaiwater net 2012 royal irrigation department rid 2011 and electricity generating authority of thailand egat 2011 or sarapin 2012 the causes accordingly have been identified as both natural i e the exceptionally adverse weather conditions and anthropogenic i e ineffective water management decisions of the two the former has been reported from very different angles for example gale and saunders 2013 s evaluation of the event s return periods bidorn et al 2015 s focus on the river sediment discharges or komori et al 2012 who emphasized the intensities of the five tropical cyclones meehan 2012 also speculated that rainfall might have also contributed considerably to the floodwaters in 2011 however without quantitative analysis the latter has been reported to be predominantly related to the debates over the operation decisions of the two upstream dam reservoirs bhumibol and sirikit e g suwan 2012 thaiwater net 2011 in thais aon benfield 2012 another commonly cited cause was the inconsistent weather forecasts that led to miscalculating the timings of the storage and discharge of the dams bauhgh et al 2016 cowling et al krajewsiki et al 2017 as such people such as sarapin 2012 assumed that the adverse impacts experienced in the cpr basin could have been avoidable or at least mitigated had the two upstream dam reservoirs operated differently it should be noted that government agencies have critically limited access to hydrologic and operating data in the years following the flood event although there is valuable information communicated amongst scientific communities about the flood event they are scattered across different disciplines as mentioned above in other words there has yet to be any systematic assessment at a basin scale for instance the exploration of the links between the tropical cyclones that landed on different parts of the country due to the heterogeneous rainfall over the cpr basin which led to the downstream floods is currently absent from the literature we believe that the lack of basin scale understanding of the event connecting the heterogeneous rainfall patterns to the river induced flooding downstream had been reinforced by public media e g thaiwater net 2011 2019a b gotoknow 2011 gotoknow 2020 these biases collectively led to an oversimplified consensus that attributes the causes of the 2011 mega floods to i the series of cyclones that hit the northern part of the country and ii poor management of the two upstream dams consequently although the characteristics of the flood event have been reported in vast detail the root cause of the 2011 catastrophic flood in thailand still remains a mystery that was never examined thoroughly via data driven approaches to fill this glaring knowledge gap this paper re evaluates the root causes of the event by synthesizing a remarkable volume of hydrological data from the gauge stations along the entire cpr basin specifically we analyzed daily water level discharge and rainfall data from over 23 gauge stations across cpr basin in 2011 we decoupled the different sources of floodwater i e river water fluvial versus rainfall pluvial in terms of their volumes that covered the lower reach of the basin one of the key findings in this study is that most of the floodwater that inundated the lower cpr basin area originated from local rainfall therefore unlike the common consensus that the 2011 thailand flood disaster was primarily caused by overbank flooding of the river i e liew et al 2016 we provide evidence that the local rainfall was the main contributor to the extensive inundation of the lower cpr basin this led to our conclusion that better accuracy of weather forecasts and management of the upstream dam would have little effect on mitigating the flood impact this paper contributes to the understanding of the flooding dynamics in south east asian river systems and beyond showing local rainfall can be a major source of the floodwater in the lower reach of the monsoonal rivers this would deepen our current understanding of the complex mechanisms of flood in large river basins provide valuable alternative insights and implications on other flood related subject domains and also offers fresh perspectives for efficient flood control and stormwater management 2 data and methods 2 1 the chao phraya river cpr basin cpr is thailand s largest drainage basin 157 924 km2 and accounts for 35 of the country s total area the cpr river is the fifth largest in southeast asia with a mean annual runoff of 4925 million m3 water environment partnership wepa the cpr emerges near the thai myanmar laos triangular borders flowing southwards for 372 km before draining into the sea at the gulf of thailand alford 1992 fig 1 a in the northern part the cpr basin is mostly hilly where four major tributaries the ping wang yom and nan drain into cpr at nakhon sawan a local geological nodal point where these rivers merge downstream of nakhon sawan the channel slope becomes gentle 0 2 m km fig 1b as the cpr enters the lowland of the basin the river starts to distribute due to avulsion and extensive development of irrigation canals the lowland portion of the basin is the main focus of this paper which encompasses areas 50 m above sea level occupying 23 of the basin area fig 1c the lower cpr sub basin is a vast flat lowland where distributaries such as tha chin diverge from the main river around chai nat and flow directly to the sea other distributaries such as the sakae krang and the pasak join cpr at uthai thani and ayutthaya respectively fig 1a shows the geographical coverage of cpr and table 1 summarizes the basin areas lengths and the total annual discharge volumes of the main tributaries 2 2 hydrological dataset and analysis the data sets of water discharge and rainfall collected by both the thailand meteorological department tmd and the royal irrigation department rid were used to investigate the hydro meteorological characteristics of the cpr basin hydrological water levels and discharges data collected consists of daily records from 8 automatic stations including three along with the cpr c 2 c 13 and c 7a upstream tributaries ping p 2a and p 17 and nan n 67 downstream tributaries sakae krang ct 19 thachin t 12 and noi ni 2 and two irrigation canals chainat ayutthaya and makhamthao uthong measured at the respective floodgates fig 1a in addition we also collected the operating information of bhumibol and sirikit dams which includes daily inflows outflows and storage progression in three consecutive years from 2009 to 2011 for the daily rainfall data the focus was given to the stations located on the lower sub basin including nakhon sawan chainat lopburi suphanburi ayutthaya pathumthani and bangkok in addition operational water level and discharge data of two upstream reservoirs bhumibol and sirikit was also obtained from the thailand royal irrigation department rid we also incorporated the loss of water volume over floodplain through evapotranspiration et using the validated modis et product modis global terrestrial evapotranspiration 8 day extract mod16a2 over the cpr basin kosa and pongput 2007 mu et al 2011 2 3 decoupling river water versus rainfall water in this section we presented a method to decouple the floodwaters from rainfall and river discharges and use the cpr reach between c 2 and c 7a the landscape in the reach is flat and the cpr presents a meandering pattern with a sinuosity index of around 1 46 this reach is also the most impacted reach by the flood in 2011 si fig 1 time wise we specifically focused on the period of the main floods from april to november 2011 in essence we compared the volumes of water that contributed to the floods from two sources fluvial and pluvial for the fluvial component we conceptualized the complex hydrographic network tributaries distributaries and irrigation canals diversion detailed map is given in fig 5a and derived the following equation 1 fluvial f l o o d w a t e r s u p s t r e a m σ d i s t r i b u t a r i e s σ c a n a l s d o w n s t r e a m where all the terms are cumulative sums of daily discharge in m3 from april to november in 2011 at the respective gauge stations more specifically the upstream consists of flows at c 2 combined with its tributary ct 19 distributaries include t 12 and ni 2 canals is the total discharge of the two irrigation canals and the downstream is the discharge measured at c 7a it should be noted that these irrigation canals are generally limited in their sizes and discharges compared to the cpr main channel or branches for example makamthao uthong is the main canal between c 2 and c 7a which has a mean annual discharge m a d of around 35 m3 s i e only around 3 of the m a d of cpr at c 2 however to provide the most refined possible floodplain water budget we considered the two main irrigation canals in this reach i e makamthao uthong and chainat ayutthaya fig 5 discharge diversion to the lopburi branch was not considered in the budget equation because most of the floodplain along the branch is upstream of c 7a and also rejoins the main cpr soon downstream the 2011 flood was a long event that lasted for almost a year therefore both precipitation and evapotranspiration et were considered for the pluvial component of floodwaters as follows 2 pluvial f l o o d w a t e r s p r e c i p i t a t i o n e t where all the terms are cumulative sums of daily volume in m3 from april to november similar to eq 1 precipitation is estimated by multiplying the rainfall depths with the respective sub catchment areas for the rainfall depths we used the daily records of seven meteorological stations in the lower cpr sub basin fig 4 we then spatially delineated the lower cpr sub basin into thiessen polygons using the geographical locations of the seven stations being analyzed şen 1998 bayraktar et al 2005 faisal and gaffar 2012 fiedler 2003 to calculate et we first extracted the et rate from the modis product for april to november 2011 over the cpr basin images in the same month were summed up to obtain one raster per month with absolute monthly et to fill gaps in the data we used inverse distance weight idw to obtain a seamless raster for each month we first calculated the mean et rate for each pixel which was then multiplied with the number of pixels covering the lower cpr sub basin the resulting multiplication was finally divided by eight given the original et unit being kg m2 8 days we consider the water loss due to groundwater seepage is negligible because the soils along the floodplain had already been saturated by the early floods in march see section 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 the chronicle overview of the tropical cyclones and flood prior to the main event the northern central eastern and southern regions of thailand had received significantly well above average amounts of rainfall in march 2011 aon benfield 2012 megotoknow org in thais on the national scale the regions that saw excessive rainfall totals and their percentages above normal in march include the north 334 central 305 eastern 113 south 1005 east coast and 502 west coast this forced ten southern provinces to be declared as disaster zones when the floodwaters killed 53 people affected more than two million people and damaged 603 486 homes aon benfield 2012 consequently these early floods had saturated the soils along the flood paths and increased the surface runoffs by lowering the infiltration rates laying the deadly groundworks for the impending disastrous flooding event promchete et al 2016 the main floods first emerged from northern thailand at the beginning of the monsoon season in late july in combination with tropical storm nok ten see si fig 1 july severe floods occurred across the northern and north eastern parts of the country in between august and december 2011 torrential downpours flash floods fluvial floods and landslides became increasingly prevalent in the northern and central parts of the country after the arrival of three additional tropical storms haitang nesat and nagael aon benfield 2012 and from www thairat co th 2011 in thai these three tropical storms dramatically exacerbated the magnitudes of already severe rainfall and flooding from june to august 2011 ping wang yom and nan rivers discharged 9885 million m3 of water equivalent to 50 of annual cumulative discharge during standard hydrological conditions aon benfield 2012 looking back in history the country has encountered at least one tropical cyclone every year since 1952 aon benfield 2012 thailand received seven major tropical storms in 1970 and 1971 each nevertheless the flood extent and the associated damages experienced in 2011 was unparalleled gale and sanders 2013 what really distinguished the 2011 event was the location of the tropical storms which triggered the reconsideration of the efficiency of the cpr in the downstream flood wave transmission discussed in more detail in section 3 3 the monthly spatial extent of flooding i e from june to december is illustrated in si fig 1 alongside the locations of two upstream dams and two major hydrological stations of cpr used in this study i e c 2 and c 7a 3 2 analyses of river discharges and local rainfalls what can they tell us about the source of the flood disaster 3 2 1 river discharge patterns during the 2011 flood this paper focused on eight stations including three along the cpr c 2 c 13 and c 7a upstream tributaries ping p 2a and p 17 and nom n 67 which are downstream tributaries sakae krang ct 19 thachin t 12 and noi ni 2 and two irrigation canals chainat ayutthaya and makhamthao uthong measured at the respective floodgates the daily discharges of these rivers were plotted in fig 2 alongside their respective capacity as designated by the rid among the analyzed stations we note that c 2 acts like a bottleneck of the entire cpr basin that collects upstream fluxes from the two main upstream tributaries ping and nan thereby representing the cpr discharge before downstream bifurcations and water loss to the floodplains see fig 3 the grey shaded polygons depict the volumes of water loss after the river capacities had been breached at three stations p 2a c 2 and c 13 the numbers in brackets are relative comparisons with the mean annual discharge m a d respectively of the station river in addition a plateau was observed in the discharge hydrographs of c 2 and c 13 suggesting the river had efficiently transferred water to the surrounding floodplain in that period for instance this value was estimated to be 2 231 million m3 which is approximately 8 of the river m a d thus we infer that at this moment the river reached both its peak discharge and the maximum channel capacity in general most hydrographs peaked around early mid october in 2011 suggesting significantly short lag times in spite of the vast geographical distances between the stations therefore we believe that these temporally concentrated peaking patterns of discharge across an extensive basin were due to the role of the local precipitations during the flood for the upper cpr sub basin the two gauge stations in the ping river basin p 2a and p 17 are more than 120 km apart from each other the downstream station p 17 reached its first peak discharge on september 15th at 2292 m3 s considerably higher than the same day measurement at the upstream station p 2a being merely 932 m3 s three weeks after on october 7th p 17 reached the second peak one day earlier than p 2a this is hydrologically impossible in a tributary system where the channel is sourced only with the upstream hydrological flux the reach between the two stations has a mostly flat terrain with no major inputs from tributaries except extensive paddy fields where intensive water extractions are common this indicates that the local precipitation has significantly contributed to the river discharge other than sourced from upstream also the total discharge in october 2011 at c 2 exceeded the sum of the two immediate upstream stations i e p 17 and n 67 by 42 5 similar patterns were observed in the lower cpr sub basin more specifically c 13 which is located at about 60 km downstream from c 2 already presented its peak discharge on september 20th 2011 almost a month before c 2 fig 2b similarly c 7a also presented its peak on october 10th 2011 also a few days earlier than the c 2 in fact the timing of the peaks for both c 13 and c 7a correlates with the arrival of tropical cyclones nesat and nalgae which hit the middle cpr basin around late september to early october in 2011 si fig 1 for the lower cpr sub basin we also included the main tributaries i e sakae krang ct 19 thachin t 12 and noi ni 2 and two irrigation canals chainat ayutthaya and makhamthao uthong as shown in fig 3a among these only the sakae krang river drains to the cpr while the others divert from the river of which the flows are plotted in fig 3c the discharges of cpr main river which are re plotted in fig 3b exceed that of the combined discharge of tributaries combined using eq 1 the total monthly budget from april to november 2011 of the cpr reach between c 2 and c 7a reach was calculated and summarized in fig 3d to reflect the progression of the floods in a nutshell it would be impossible for c 13 and c 7a which are about 60 and 150 km downstream from the c 2 respectively to reach their peak discharges before c 2 without the inputs from local precipitation based on the analysis of climatic data promchete et al 2016 also speculated that the series of tropical cyclones that struck the northern part of thailand in 2011 were less likely to cause the catastrophic flood hazard downstream though without a quantification 3 2 2 analysis of the river discharge against the local rainfalls what was the primary source of flooding this section examines the significance of the local precipitation in the lower cpr sub basin through a comparison with the ultimate river discharge for the readers convenience fig 4a depicts the locations of the discharge and rainfall stations which were used in our analysis to decouple the floodwaters into fluvial and pluvial components fig 4b presents the daily discharges in three consecutive years 2009 2010 2011 of six major stations three along with the cpr c 2 c 13 and c 7a with the remaining from upstream tributaries including ping p 2a and p 17 and nom n 67 the volume of precipitation over the lower cpr sub basin was calculated using daily rainfall measurements over seven rain gauges nakhon sawan chainat lopburi suphan buri ayutthaya pathumthani and bangkok as illustrated in fig 4c using eq 2 the daily volumes contributed from precipitation and the loss from et was calculated finally the contributions from fluvial and pluvial components are compared in terms of cumulative volumes of floodwaters fig 5a and the monthly ratios between the two fig 5b in general the pluvial cumulative volume was 57 2 km3 73 7 whereas the fluvial waters contributed 20 4 km3 23 7 the loss through et however was found to be comparatively minor at 0 002 km3 in addition the monthly ratios of volumes from precipitation and discharges are constantly well over 2 even exceeding 5 during the typhoon period from june to september fig 5b in particular the highest ratio found in june also coincides with the arrival time of the first cyclone haima most critically these results confirm the significant yet overlooked responsibility of local rainfall in the 2011 megafloods in thailand especially in the lower cpr sub basin 3 3 revisiting the dam operations could a different operation have mitigated the catastrophe in the aftermath of the flood disaster the operators of two upstream dams received severe backlash from the mass media thaiwater 2012 in thais which accused them of regulating the dams poorly and consequently implying that the flood event was a human disaster additionally the general consensus amongst thailand s population was that the main cause of the disastrous flood was the inaccurate rainfall prediction in the cpr basin despite the significant drought over the past two years that may have skewed the prediction in 2011 isrnews org 2012 in thai however if the catastrophe were in fact more localized pluvial than centralized fluvial would the impacts have been much less dire if the upstream dams had stored more water during the wet season particularly after august of 2011 to address this burning question we revisited the operations of the two dams in three consecutive years 2009 2010 and 2011 specifically the storage progression inflows and outflow curves of bhumibol and sirikit dam reservoirs were collected and analyzed fig 6 the two dams named after the country s his and her majesty king bhumibol and queen sirikit are situated in two different river basins ping and nan respectively on a yearly basis both reservoirs would see their storages continuously drawn down from january to april this is typical for summer seasons fig 2a and b of particular interest is how 2009 and 2010 saw back to back historical droughts which resulted in both reservoirs reaching their dead storage levels thaiwater net 2011 2019a and b in thais by the end of may the two reservoirs started to see their storage curves picking up the rising limbs and achieved their respective operational zones between urc and lrc on may 31st for bhumibol and june 27th for sirikit these were far earlier than the two previous years during which the two dam reservoirs could not reach their respective lrc by october in fact the storage curve of the sirikit reservoir in 2009 did not even reach the lrc level fig 6a and b this was the very first sign of abnormalities in 2011 geographically between the two mega structures sirikit is more prone to the risks from ocean emerged extreme weather conditions the 2011 flood event is a testament to this this is even more critical as the storage capacity of sirikit reservoirs is approximately 30 less than the reservoir on the ping river so even if the sirikit reservoir had been able to store an additional 2500 million m3 equivalent to the operational storage the volume of floodwaters could have only been reduced by 2 nevertheless in the 2011 flood event the sirikit dam was constantly hit by the tropical storms firstly by haima in late july followed by nokten in late august and then the trio of haitang nesat and nagael in late september the monsoon troughs arriving intermittently between these cyclones increased the inflow dramatically fig 6d quickly filling up the reservoir thereby forcing the dam operators to maximize its outflows while having to open the spillway for dam safety from early august until the middle of october fig 6b unaffected by haima in june bhumibol only encountered the first storm the nokten one month later between july and august while the sirikit dam was being struck by the first cyclone discharge from the bhumibol dam reservoir was still restricted this was partly due to little demand for water downstream with the larger storage capacity the dam operator should have had more flexibility and there was no reason not to believe so because by august the bhumibol reservoir had only been 63 full compared to 80 of sirikit if this additional storage had been used to store the floodwaters the total volume would have been reduced by another 3 however by the end of august when bhumibol operators decided to increase the outflows they could only do so in a restricted manner due to the already severe floods in the upper cpr sub basin see si fig 1 august the situation continued to rapidly exacerbate in the following month until ultimately dam operators were forced to maximize the outflow of the bhumibol reservoir and open the spillway to avoid dam failure but this was not until september fig 6a collectively even if the two reservoirs had stored more water the total volume of floodwater channeled to the lower cpr would have only decreased by approximately 5 in other words even if dam operators were armed with more accurate weather forecasts the lower cpr would have experienced an essentially similar level of flooding and damages regardless simply because the main flooding source was local rainfall and not water from the river it should be underscored here that others such as komori et al 2012 might contend against our estimation by positing the following the volume of floodwaters would be reduced if water from the dams had been released sooner even if it meant inundating immediate downstream areas for instance mateo et al 2014 or jamrussri and toda 2017 estimated that the two reservoirs combined could have reduced up to 20 of the flood extents however it should be noted that these speculations were done based on numerical modeling while our results were based explicitly on observational data nevertheless the debate over an accurate percentage is not the goal of this study moreover re investigating the operations in 2011 in comparison with the two consecutive hydrological years have shown that the operating decisions at every specific point of time were understandable storm surges could also possibly become a source of floodwater in the lowland areas around bangkok during the cyclone however the lowermost gauge station i e c 7a that we analyzed in this study is around 100 km upstream from the gulf of thailand given this large distance it would be implausible for water from the storm surge to reach that far upstream to contribute to the flooding 4 summary and remarks in this paper we revisited the great 2011 thailand flood in the chao phraya river cpr and identified its root cause this was achieved by analyzing hydro meteorological data from several gauge stations across the cpr basin this study has a significant advantage over previously published works in that we were able to access new data sets that were originally off limits during the time of the event this allowed us to contribute to existing conceptual understandings on the causes of the catastrophic flood specifically by decoupling the flood water sources river overflow versus local rainfall we found that most of the floodwater along the lower cpr was contributed by the local precipitation 73 7 almost three times the contribution from the river discharges 27 3 this goes against the conventional belief thus far that the overflow of the river was the main culprit of the catastrophe most of the hydrographs of the cpr tributaries peaked around early mid october in 2011 which is significantly short given the geographical distances between the stations this suggests that these temporally concentrated peaking patterns of discharge across the vast basin was related to the role of the local precipitations during the flood in addition to relying on the operations of the large reservoirs to regulate the basin scale flows tebaraki et al 2012 perhaps decentralized retrofitting responses to handle pluvial flood risks could be worth exploring loc et al 2017 loc et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 with specific respect to the operations of the two upstream reservoirs the gauge station data driven reasoning of this paper has proved that even if more water had been stored in the upstream dams due to better rainfall predictions it would have done little to ameliorate the magnitude of flooding in the case of the sirikit dam which encountered the first cyclone one month earlier than the bhumibol and had a smaller storage capacity the operators therefore were left with very little options large rivers in southeast asia have always played a vital role in people s livelihoods in many aspects such as providing hydro powers water for irrigation and transportation in fact seasonal floods from the major rivers in southeast asia play an indispensable role in feeding water and sediments to the agricultural production in lowland regions dang et al 2011 dinh et al 2012 park et al 2020 tri et al 2013 the extreme floods however can cause extensive loss of life and property and are becoming increasingly prevalent in southeast asia garbero and muttarak 2013 most of the major cities in this region with the largest population growth rates are located on a floodplain thereby rendering them highly vulnerable to flood disasters from the rivers the general association of floods with overbank flow created overwhelmingly pressures for the river managers especially during the aftermath of flood events even though other factors which also can be comparable relevance could have escaped the spotlight this paper has provided such a case in point in that whilst the contribution of precipitation to flooding has been widely recognized their role in flooding events has always been prematurely regarded to be minor e g kesel 2003 mohapatra and singh 2003 yin and li 2001 park and latrubesse 2017 park 2020 by re analyzing one of the most catastrophic flood events in southeast asian history we have established how local rainfall can be the primary source and cause of flooding in the lower reach of a river we expect that the findings of this paper will help improve our understanding of the complex mechanisms of flood in large river basins with the hope that this novel insight will encourage a critical re evaluation of our conceptual understanding of the role of

5286,the great 2011 thailand flood is one of the most catastrophic flood disasters recorded worldwide in modern history which covered about 100 000 km2 of the country and resulted in 813 casualties and incurring us 46 billion in economic losses in this paper we re evaluate the flood event to identify the root source of the catastrophe by analyzing hydrological data from gauge stations along the chao phraya river cpr and remote sensing data we decoupled the volumetric contributions of river overflow and local rainfall to the lowland reach of the basin and found that the latter contributed most to the flooding more specifically out of the total of 77 6 km3 of floodwaters estimated 73 7 was from precipitation while only 26 3 was from river discharges this finding differs from the official reports or previous studies which attributed the main cause of the river overbank flow therefore it is also inferred that the upstream dam operations would have been only marginally helpful in mitigating the flood since rainfall made up most of the floodwaters in the downstream reach of the river our finding offers a new perspective that the local rainfall could be a significant source of the floodwater rather than river overflow in the lower reaches of a large monsoonal river system in southeast asia thus this paper contributes to the understanding of complex flood processes in large river basins and provides fresh insights for efficient flood control and stormwater management keywords flood natural disaster river rainfall inundation thailand southeast asia 1 introduction one of the greatest floods in thai history occurred in 2011 between august and december with an estimated floodwater volume of around 15 billion m3 komori et al 2012 rakwatin et al 2013 this major disaster resulted in 813 casualties and three missing people world bank 2012 the flood covered a spatial extent of approximately 97 000 km2 which is around 4 of the country and affected over 66 out of the 77 provinces in thailand it also destroyed more than 1 8 million homes and displaced 2 5 million people in 6 months august to january 2012 dhi 2012 aon benfield 2012 although these statistics do not rank amongst the top ten global floods that have been reported since 1982 this flooding event surpasses these flood events in terms of economic damages which totalled up to approximately us 45 5 billion hence it is one of the most catastrophic and costliest in land flood disasters recorded in modern history world bank 2012 poosuwan 2020 this is evident from how thailand s economic growth in 2011 drastically dropped from 3 7 to 0 1 which was primarily due to the losses in physical assets products raw materials machinery and shelters bidorn et al 2015 previous studies which attempted to

from international organizations e g aon benfield 2012 2 ministry of agriculture and cooperatives japan international cooperation agency jica 2013 or individual experts meehan 2012 and local reports in thais such as thaiwater net 2012 royal irrigation department rid 2011 and electricity generating authority of thailand egat 2011 or sarapin 2012 the causes accordingly have been identified as both natural i e the exceptionally adverse weather conditions and anthropogenic i e ineffective water management decisions of the two the former has been reported from very different angles for example gale and saunders 2013 s evaluation of the event s return periods bidorn et al 2015 s focus on the river sediment discharges or komori et al 2012 who emphasized the intensities of the five tropical cyclones meehan 2012 also speculated that rainfall might have also contributed considerably to the floodwaters in 2011 however without quantitative analysis the latter has been reported to be predominantly related to the debates over the operation decisions of the two upstream dam reservoirs bhumibol and sirikit e g suwan 2012 thaiwater net 2011 in thais aon benfield 2012 another commonly cited cause was the inconsistent weather forecasts that led to miscalculating the timings of the storage and discharge of the dams bauhgh et al 2016 cowling et al krajewsiki et al 2017 as such people such as sarapin 2012 assumed that the adverse impacts experienced in the cpr basin could have been avoidable or at least mitigated had the two upstream dam reservoirs operated differently it should be noted that government agencies have critically limited access to hydrologic and operating data in the years following the flood event although there is valuable information communicated amongst scientific communities about the flood event they are scattered across different disciplines as mentioned above in other words there has yet to be any systematic assessment at a basin scale for instance the exploration of the links between the tropical cyclones that landed on different parts of the country due to the heterogeneous rainfall over the cpr basin which led to the downstream floods is currently absent from the literature we believe that the lack of basin scale understanding of the event connecting the heterogeneous rainfall patterns to the river induced flooding downstream had been reinforced by public media e g thaiwater net 2011 2019a b gotoknow 2011 gotoknow 2020 these biases collectively led to an oversimplified consensus that attributes the causes of the 2011 mega floods to i the series of cyclones that hit the northern part of the country and ii poor management of the two upstream dams consequently although the characteristics of the flood event have been reported in vast detail the root cause of the 2011 catastrophic flood in thailand still remains a mystery that was never examined thoroughly via data driven approaches to fill this glaring knowledge gap this paper re evaluates the root causes of the event by synthesizing a remarkable volume of hydrological data from the gauge stations along the entire cpr basin specifically we analyzed daily water level discharge and rainfall data from over 23 gauge stations across cpr basin in 2011 we decoupled the different sources of floodwater i e river water fluvial versus rainfall pluvial in terms of their volumes that covered the lower reach of the basin one of the key findings in this study is that most of the floodwater that inundated the lower cpr basin area originated from local rainfall therefore unlike the common consensus that the 2011 thailand flood disaster was primarily caused by overbank flooding of the river i e liew et al 2016 we provide evidence that the local rainfall was the main contributor to the extensive inundation of the lower cpr basin this led to our conclusion that better accuracy of weather forecasts and management of the upstream dam would have little effect on mitigating the flood impact this paper contributes to the understanding of the flooding dynamics in south east asian river systems and beyond showing local rainfall can be a major source of the floodwater in the lower reach of the monsoonal rivers this would deepen our current understanding of the complex mechanisms of flood in large river basins provide valuable alternative insights and implications on other flood related subject domains and also offers fresh perspectives for efficient flood control and stormwater management 2 data and methods 2 1 the chao phraya river cpr basin cpr is thailand s largest drainage basin 157 924 km2 and accounts for 35 of the country s total area the cpr river is the fifth largest in southeast asia with a mean annual runoff of 4925 million m3 water environment partnership wepa the cpr emerges near the thai myanmar laos triangular borders flowing southwards for 372 km before draining into the sea at the gulf of thailand alford 1992 fig 1 a in the northern part the cpr basin is mostly hilly where four major tributaries the ping wang yom and nan drain into cpr at nakhon sawan a local geological nodal point where these rivers merge downstream of nakhon sawan the channel slope becomes gentle 0 2 m km fig 1b as the cpr enters the lowland of the basin the river starts to distribute due to avulsion and extensive development of irrigation canals the lowland portion of the basin is the main focus of this paper which encompasses areas 50 m above sea level occupying 23 of the basin area fig 1c the lower cpr sub basin is a vast flat lowland where distributaries such as tha chin diverge from the main river around chai nat and flow directly to the sea other distributaries such as the sakae krang and the pasak join cpr at uthai thani and ayutthaya respectively fig 1a shows the geographical coverage of cpr and table 1 summarizes the basin areas lengths and the total annual discharge volumes of the main tributaries 2 2 hydrological dataset and analysis the data sets of water discharge and rainfall collected by both the thailand meteorological department tmd and the royal irrigation department rid were used to investigate the hydro meteorological characteristics of the cpr basin hydrological water levels and discharges data collected consists of daily records from 8 automatic stations including three along with the cpr c 2 c 13 and c 7a upstream tributaries ping p 2a and p 17 and nan n 67 downstream tributaries sakae krang ct 19 thachin t 12 and noi ni 2 and two irrigation canals chainat ayutthaya and makhamthao uthong measured at the respective floodgates fig 1a in addition we also collected the operating information of bhumibol and sirikit dams which includes daily inflows outflows and storage progression in three consecutive years from 2009 to 2011 for the daily rainfall data the focus was given to the stations located on the lower sub basin including nakhon sawan chainat lopburi suphanburi ayutthaya pathumthani and bangkok in addition operational water level and discharge data of two upstream reservoirs bhumibol and sirikit was also obtained from the thailand royal irrigation department rid we also incorporated the loss of water volume over floodplain through evapotranspiration et using the validated modis et product modis global terrestrial evapotranspiration 8 day extract mod16a2 over the cpr basin kosa and pongput 2007 mu et al 2011 2 3 decoupling river water versus rainfall water in this section we presented a method to decouple the floodwaters from rainfall and river discharges and use the cpr reach between c 2 and c 7a the landscape in the reach is flat and the cpr presents a meandering pattern with a sinuosity index of around 1 46 this reach is also the most impacted reach by the flood in 2011 si fig 1 time wise we specifically focused on the period of the main floods from april to november 2011 in essence we compared the volumes of water that contributed to the floods from two sources fluvial and pluvial for the fluvial component we conceptualized the complex hydrographic network tributaries distributaries and irrigation canals diversion detailed map is given in fig 5a and derived the following equation 1 fluvial f l o o d w a t e r s u p s t r e a m σ d i s t r i b u t a r i e s σ c a n a l s d o w n s t r e a m where all the terms are cumulative sums of daily discharge in m3 from april to november in 2011 at the respective gauge stations more specifically the upstream consists of flows at c 2 combined with its tributary ct 19 distributaries include t 12 and ni 2 canals is the total discharge of the two irrigation canals and the downstream is the discharge measured at c 7a it should be noted that these irrigation canals are generally limited in their sizes and discharges compared to the cpr main channel or branches for example makamthao uthong is the main canal between c 2 and c 7a which has a mean annual discharge m a d of around 35 m3 s i e only around 3 of the m a d of cpr at c 2 however to provide the most refined possible floodplain water budget we considered the two main irrigation canals in this reach i e makamthao uthong and chainat ayutthaya fig 5 discharge diversion to the lopburi branch was not considered in the budget equation because most of the floodplain along the branch is upstream of c 7a and also rejoins the main cpr soon downstream the 2011 flood was a long event that lasted for almost a year therefore both precipitation and evapotranspiration et were considered for the pluvial component of floodwaters as follows 2 pluvial f l o o d w a t e r s p r e c i p i t a t i o n e t where all the terms are cumulative sums of daily volume in m3 from april to november similar to eq 1 precipitation is estimated by multiplying the rainfall depths with the respective sub catchment areas for the rainfall depths we used the daily records of seven meteorological stations in the lower cpr sub basin fig 4 we then spatially delineated the lower cpr sub basin into thiessen polygons using the geographical locations of the seven stations being analyzed şen 1998 bayraktar et al 2005 faisal and gaffar 2012 fiedler 2003 to calculate et we first extracted the et rate from the modis product for april to november 2011 over the cpr basin images in the same month were summed up to obtain one raster per month with absolute monthly et to fill gaps in the data we used inverse distance weight idw to obtain a seamless raster for each month we first calculated the mean et rate for each pixel which was then multiplied with the number of pixels covering the lower cpr sub basin the resulting multiplication was finally divided by eight given the original et unit being kg m2 8 days we consider the water loss due to groundwater seepage is negligible because the soils along the floodplain had already been saturated by the early floods in march see section 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 the chronicle overview of the tropical cyclones and flood prior to the main event the northern central eastern and southern regions of thailand had received significantly well above average amounts of rainfall in march 2011 aon benfield 2012 megotoknow org in thais on the national scale the regions that saw excessive rainfall totals and their percentages above normal in march include the north 334 central 305 eastern 113 south 1005 east coast and 502 west coast this forced ten southern provinces to be declared as disaster zones when the floodwaters killed 53 people affected more than two million people and damaged 603 486 homes aon benfield 2012 consequently these early floods had saturated the soils along the flood paths and increased the surface runoffs by lowering the infiltration rates laying the deadly groundworks for the impending disastrous flooding event promchete et al 2016 the main floods first emerged from northern thailand at the beginning of the monsoon season in late july in combination with tropical storm nok ten see si fig 1 july severe floods occurred across the northern and north eastern parts of the country in between august and december 2011 torrential downpours flash floods fluvial floods and landslides became increasingly prevalent in the northern and central parts of the country after the arrival of three additional tropical storms haitang nesat and nagael aon benfield 2012 and from www thairat co th 2011 in thai these three tropical storms dramatically exacerbated the magnitudes of already severe rainfall and flooding from june to august 2011 ping wang yom and nan rivers discharged 9885 million m3 of water equivalent to 50 of annual cumulative discharge during standard hydrological conditions aon benfield 2012 looking back in history the country has encountered at least one tropical cyclone every year since 1952 aon benfield 2012 thailand received seven major tropical storms in 1970 and 1971 each nevertheless the flood extent and the associated damages experienced in 2011 was unparalleled gale and sanders 2013 what really distinguished the 2011 event was the location of the tropical storms which triggered the reconsideration of the efficiency of the cpr in the downstream flood wave transmission discussed in more detail in section 3 3 the monthly spatial extent of flooding i e from june to december is illustrated in si fig 1 alongside the locations of two upstream dams and two major hydrological stations of cpr used in this study i e c 2 and c 7a 3 2 analyses of river discharges and local rainfalls what can they tell us about the source of the flood disaster 3 2 1 river discharge patterns during the 2011 flood this paper focused on eight stations including three along the cpr c 2 c 13 and c 7a upstream tributaries ping p 2a and p 17 and nom n 67 which are downstream tributaries sakae krang ct 19 thachin t 12 and noi ni 2 and two irrigation canals chainat ayutthaya and makhamthao uthong measured at the respective floodgates the daily discharges of these rivers were plotted in fig 2 alongside their respective capacity as designated by the rid among the analyzed stations we note that c 2 acts like a bottleneck of the entire cpr basin that collects upstream fluxes from the two main upstream tributaries ping and nan thereby representing the cpr discharge before downstream bifurcations and water loss to the floodplains see fig 3 the grey shaded polygons depict the volumes of water loss after the river capacities had been breached at three stations p 2a c 2 and c 13 the numbers in brackets are relative comparisons with the mean annual discharge m a d respectively of the station river in addition a plateau was observed in the discharge hydrographs of c 2 and c 13 suggesting the river had efficiently transferred water to the surrounding floodplain in that period for instance this value was estimated to be 2 231 million m3 which is approximately 8 of the river m a d thus we infer that at this moment the river reached both its peak discharge and the maximum channel capacity in general most hydrographs peaked around early mid october in 2011 suggesting significantly short lag times in spite of the vast geographical distances between the stations therefore we believe that these temporally concentrated peaking patterns of discharge across an extensive basin were due to the role of the local precipitations during the flood for the upper cpr sub basin the two gauge stations in the ping river basin p 2a and p 17 are more than 120 km apart from each other the downstream station p 17 reached its first peak discharge on september 15th at 2292 m3 s considerably higher than the same day measurement at the upstream station p 2a being merely 932 m3 s three weeks after on october 7th p 17 reached the second peak one day earlier than p 2a this is hydrologically impossible in a tributary system where the channel is sourced only with the upstream hydrological flux the reach between the two stations has a mostly flat terrain with no major inputs from tributaries except extensive paddy fields where intensive water extractions are common this indicates that the local precipitation has significantly contributed to the river discharge other than sourced from upstream also the total discharge in october 2011 at c 2 exceeded the sum of the two immediate upstream stations i e p 17 and n 67 by 42 5 similar patterns were observed in the lower cpr sub basin more specifically c 13 which is located at about 60 km downstream from c 2 already presented its peak discharge on september 20th 2011 almost a month before c 2 fig 2b similarly c 7a also presented its peak on october 10th 2011 also a few days earlier than the c 2 in fact the timing of the peaks for both c 13 and c 7a correlates with the arrival of tropical cyclones nesat and nalgae which hit the middle cpr basin around late september to early october in 2011 si fig 1 for the lower cpr sub basin we also included the main tributaries i e sakae krang ct 19 thachin t 12 and noi ni 2 and two irrigation canals chainat ayutthaya and makhamthao uthong as shown in fig 3a among these only the sakae krang river drains to the cpr while the others divert from the river of which the flows are plotted in fig 3c the discharges of cpr main river which are re plotted in fig 3b exceed that of the combined discharge of tributaries combined using eq 1 the total monthly budget from april to november 2011 of the cpr reach between c 2 and c 7a reach was calculated and summarized in fig 3d to reflect the progression of the floods in a nutshell it would be impossible for c 13 and c 7a which are about 60 and 150 km downstream from the c 2 respectively to reach their peak discharges before c 2 without the inputs from local precipitation based on the analysis of climatic data promchete et al 2016 also speculated that the series of tropical cyclones that struck the northern part of thailand in 2011 were less likely to cause the catastrophic flood hazard downstream though without a quantification 3 2 2 analysis of the river discharge against the local rainfalls what was the primary source of flooding this section examines the significance of the local precipitation in the lower cpr sub basin through a comparison with the ultimate river discharge for the readers convenience fig 4a depicts the locations of the discharge and rainfall stations which were used in our analysis to decouple the floodwaters into fluvial and pluvial components fig 4b presents the daily discharges in three consecutive years 2009 2010 2011 of six major stations three along with the cpr c 2 c 13 and c 7a with the remaining from upstream tributaries including ping p 2a and p 17 and nom n 67 the volume of precipitation over the lower cpr sub basin was calculated using daily rainfall measurements over seven rain gauges nakhon sawan chainat lopburi suphan buri ayutthaya pathumthani and bangkok as illustrated in fig 4c using eq 2 the daily volumes contributed from precipitation and the loss from et was calculated finally the contributions from fluvial and pluvial components are compared in terms of cumulative volumes of floodwaters fig 5a and the monthly ratios between the two fig 5b in general the pluvial cumulative volume was 57 2 km3 73 7 whereas the fluvial waters contributed 20 4 km3 23 7 the loss through et however was found to be comparatively minor at 0 002 km3 in addition the monthly ratios of volumes from precipitation and discharges are constantly well over 2 even exceeding 5 during the typhoon period from june to september fig 5b in particular the highest ratio found in june also coincides with the arrival time of the first cyclone haima most critically these results confirm the significant yet overlooked responsibility of local rainfall in the 2011 megafloods in thailand especially in the lower cpr sub basin 3 3 revisiting the dam operations could a different operation have mitigated the catastrophe in the aftermath of the flood disaster the operators of two upstream dams received severe backlash from the mass media thaiwater 2012 in thais which accused them of regulating the dams poorly and consequently implying that the flood event was a human disaster additionally the general consensus amongst thailand s population was that the main cause of the disastrous flood was the inaccurate rainfall prediction in the cpr basin despite the significant drought over the past two years that may have skewed the prediction in 2011 isrnews org 2012 in thai however if the catastrophe were in fact more localized pluvial than centralized fluvial would the impacts have been much less dire if the upstream dams had stored more water during the wet season particularly after august of 2011 to address this burning question we revisited the operations of the two dams in three consecutive years 2009 2010 and 2011 specifically the storage progression inflows and outflow curves of bhumibol and sirikit dam reservoirs were collected and analyzed fig 6 the two dams named after the country s his and her majesty king bhumibol and queen sirikit are situated in two different river basins ping and nan respectively on a yearly basis both reservoirs would see their storages continuously drawn down from january to april this is typical for summer seasons fig 2a and b of particular interest is how 2009 and 2010 saw back to back historical droughts which resulted in both reservoirs reaching their dead storage levels thaiwater net 2011 2019a and b in thais by the end of may the two reservoirs started to see their storage curves picking up the rising limbs and achieved their respective operational zones between urc and lrc on may 31st for bhumibol and june 27th for sirikit these were far earlier than the two previous years during which the two dam reservoirs could not reach their respective lrc by october in fact the storage curve of the sirikit reservoir in 2009 did not even reach the lrc level fig 6a and b this was the very first sign of abnormalities in 2011 geographically between the two mega structures sirikit is more prone to the risks from ocean emerged extreme weather conditions the 2011 flood event is a testament to this this is even more critical as the storage capacity of sirikit reservoirs is approximately 30 less than the reservoir on the ping river so even if the sirikit reservoir had been able to store an additional 2500 million m3 equivalent to the operational storage the volume of floodwaters could have only been reduced by 2 nevertheless in the 2011 flood event the sirikit dam was constantly hit by the tropical storms firstly by haima in late july followed by nokten in late august and then the trio of haitang nesat and nagael in late september the monsoon troughs arriving intermittently between these cyclones increased the inflow dramatically fig 6d quickly filling up the reservoir thereby forcing the dam operators to maximize its outflows while having to open the spillway for dam safety from early august until the middle of october fig 6b unaffected by haima in june bhumibol only encountered the first storm the nokten one month later between july and august while the sirikit dam was being struck by the first cyclone discharge from the bhumibol dam reservoir was still restricted this was partly due to little demand for water downstream with the larger storage capacity the dam operator should have had more flexibility and there was no reason not to believe so because by august the bhumibol reservoir had only been 63 full compared to 80 of sirikit if this additional storage had been used to store the floodwaters the total volume would have been reduced by another 3 however by the end of august when bhumibol operators decided to increase the outflows they could only do so in a restricted manner due to the already severe floods in the upper cpr sub basin see si fig 1 august the situation continued to rapidly exacerbate in the following month until ultimately dam operators were forced to maximize the outflow of the bhumibol reservoir and open the spillway to avoid dam failure but this was not until september fig 6a collectively even if the two reservoirs had stored more water the total volume of floodwater channeled to the lower cpr would have only decreased by approximately 5 in other words even if dam operators were armed with more accurate weather forecasts the lower cpr would have experienced an essentially similar level of flooding and damages regardless simply because the main flooding source was local rainfall and not water from the river it should be underscored here that others such as komori et al 2012 might contend against our estimation by positing the following the volume of floodwaters would be reduced if water from the dams had been released sooner even if it meant inundating immediate downstream areas for instance mateo et al 2014 or jamrussri and toda 2017 estimated that the two reservoirs combined could have reduced up to 20 of the flood extents however it should be noted that these speculations were done based on numerical modeling while our results were based explicitly on observational data nevertheless the debate over an accurate percentage is not the goal of this study moreover re investigating the operations in 2011 in comparison with the two consecutive hydrological years have shown that the operating decisions at every specific point of time were understandable storm surges could also possibly become a source of floodwater in the lowland areas around bangkok during the cyclone however the lowermost gauge station i e c 7a that we analyzed in this study is around 100 km upstream from the gulf of thailand given this large distance it would be implausible for water from the storm surge to reach that far upstream to contribute to the flooding 4 summary and remarks in this paper we revisited the great 2011 thailand flood in the chao phraya river cpr and identified its root cause this was achieved by analyzing hydro meteorological data from several gauge stations across the cpr basin this study has a significant advantage over previously published works in that we were able to access new data sets that were originally off limits during the time of the event this allowed us to contribute to existing conceptual understandings on the causes of the catastrophic flood specifically by decoupling the flood water sources river overflow versus local rainfall we found that most of the floodwater along the lower cpr was contributed by the local precipitation 73 7 almost three times the contribution from the river discharges 27 3 this goes against the conventional belief thus far that the overflow of the river was the main culprit of the catastrophe most of the hydrographs of the cpr tributaries peaked around early mid october in 2011 which is significantly short given the geographical distances between the stations this suggests that these temporally concentrated peaking patterns of discharge across the vast basin was related to the role of the local precipitations during the flood in addition to relying on the operations of the large reservoirs to regulate the basin scale flows tebaraki et al 2012 perhaps decentralized retrofitting responses to handle pluvial flood risks could be worth exploring loc et al 2017 loc et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 with specific respect to the operations of the two upstream reservoirs the gauge station data driven reasoning of this paper has proved that even if more water had been stored in the upstream dams due to better rainfall predictions it would have done little to ameliorate the magnitude of flooding in the case of the sirikit dam which encountered the first cyclone one month earlier than the bhumibol and had a smaller storage capacity the operators therefore were left with very little options large rivers in southeast asia have always played a vital role in people s livelihoods in many aspects such as providing hydro powers water for irrigation and transportation in fact seasonal floods from the major rivers in southeast asia play an indispensable role in feeding water and sediments to the agricultural production in lowland regions dang et al 2011 dinh et al 2012 park et al 2020 tri et al 2013 the extreme floods however can cause extensive loss of life and property and are becoming increasingly prevalent in southeast asia garbero and muttarak 2013 most of the major cities in this region with the largest population growth rates are located on a floodplain thereby rendering them highly vulnerable to flood disasters from the rivers the general association of floods with overbank flow created overwhelmingly pressures for the river managers especially during the aftermath of flood events even though other factors which also can be comparable relevance could have escaped the spotlight this paper has provided such a case in point in that whilst the contribution of precipitation to flooding has been widely recognized their role in flooding events has always been prematurely regarded to be minor e g kesel 2003 mohapatra and singh 2003 yin and li 2001 park and latrubesse 2017 park 2020 by re analyzing one of the most catastrophic flood events in southeast asian history we have established how local rainfall can be the primary source and cause of flooding in the lower reach of a river we expect that the findings of this paper will help improve our understanding of the complex mechanisms of flood in large river basins with the hope that this novel insight will encourage a critical re evaluation of our conceptual understanding of the role of precipitation in flooding credit authorship contribution statement huu loc ho conceptualization data curation formal analysis methodology writing original draft writing review editing edward park

5287,the development of shallow landslides is strongly connected to the changes in the water content of soils on hillslopes their clay content and permeability distribution which in turn are playing an important role regarding their hydro mechanical properties a non intrusive geophysical method able to map these properties would be very helpful the most common geoelectrical method dc direct current resistivity cannot be used as a stand alone technique for this purpose since it depends on two contributions bulk and surface conductivities which depend on the water content and the cation exchange capacity cec of the material induced polarization is a geophysical method that can be now used to complement dc resistivity in providing key material properties that can be used to diagnose potential risks for failure we first recall the basic principles behind the induced polarization method from laboratory to field scales and key findings in the underlying petrophysics needed to jointly interpret electrical conductivity and normalized chargeability tomograms then we apply these relationships to a field survey carried out over a shallow landslide at claix isère france close to grenoble a 3d induced polarization survey was carried out and interpreted in terms of the clay content water content and permeability distributions we demonstrate that the landslide is associated with a channel of high water content corresponding with the presence of travertine a flow path and a permeability barrier downslope corresponding to the presence of plastic clays this study demonstrates that induced polarization can be used to characterize the impacted volume and therefore might have been useful to map the area before the landslide to assess the possible risk of failure this methodology could play a key role in mitigation planning keywords induced polarization landslides flow path permeability 1 introduction because of the threat that landslides pose to public safety

type porous crusting on december 30 2017 a shallow landslide occurred over an area of 30 17 m2 fig 1 it mobilized roughly 1000 to 1500 m3 of earth material killing one person in a house downslope that was partly destroyed by the landslide the landslide occurred after ten days of rain associated with significant variations in temperature which could allow snowfall as well as the melting of the snowpack in order to better understand why the landslide occurred in this area a geophysical campaign was undertaken in june 2018 using induced polarization and dc resistivity four samples were collected at different outcrops to characterize the electrical properties of the lithological end members an additional sample of a clean limestone not from the test site was added to this collection to represent the unweathered bedrock 3 induced polarization from the laboratory to the field scale 3 1 spectral induced polarization in this section we first describe the theoretical background associated with induced polarization of porous materials a sketch of the polarization of the electrical double layer is shown in fig 2 the electrical conductivity and polarization of a porous material can be characterized by an amplitude σ in s m 1 obtained using ohm s law and a phase shift φ in rad between an injected harmonic current and its associated electrical field we define the complex valued conductivity σ ω as 1 σ ω σ e i φ σ ω i σ ω where i 2 1 σ and σ both in s m 1 denote the in phase and quadrature conductivity respectively the complex conductivity is introduced to separate the effect of conduction real part from the effect of polarization imaginary part the dynamic stern layer model developed by revil et al 2017a b c represents a key concept developed to understand and rationalize the underlying physics of induced polarization according to this model the complex conductivity is given by 2 σ ω σ m n 0 h τ 1 i ω τ 1 2 d τ i ω ε 3 σ θ m σ w θ m 1 ρ g b cec 4 σ 0 θ m σ

revil et al 2017a b c as r λ b 0 10 0 02 considering the quadrature conductivity at the geometric mean frequency of two frequencies f 1 and f 2 and the normalized chargeability defined as the difference between the in phase conductivity at the frequency f 2 f 1 and the in phase conductivity at the lower frequency f 1 we can connect the quadrature conductivity and the normalized chargeability with revil et al 2017a 6 σ f 1 f 2 m n f 1 f 2 α and α 2 π ln a where a is the number of decades between f1 andf2 for instance for 3 decades a 103 and α 4 4 from eq 6 and the expression

2020b the permeability can be determined as 7 k k 0 θ 6 ρ g c e c 2 with k 0 10 4 30 and k is expressed in m2 so the permeability can be determined from the water content θ and the cec since the cec can be related to the pore size eq 7 can be considered as an extension of the kozeny carman equation revil and cathles 1999 equations 1 7 constitute a good conceptual model but the coefficients for the various parameters would vary from site to site this is why a petrophysical study is recommended these set of equations can be however used to bridge the lithology to the electrical parameters of interest in hydrogeophysics 3 2 time domain induced polarization we discuss now how time domain induced polarization measurements are performed this is important to connect the field data collected through this approach and the laboratory data for which we use spectral frequency domain induced polarization in time domain induced polarization a box current of a period t is injected in the ground through two current electrodes a and b figs 3 and 4 see for instance titov et al 2002 the voltage difference is measured at two voltage electrodes m and n over time during and after the injection and the shut down of the current respectively the apparent partial chargeability can be computed as a function of the decaying voltage generated after the current shutdown as 8 m a 1 δ ψ 0 t i t i 1 δ ψ mn t d t where δ ψ mn t is the time dependent decaying voltage recorded between electrodes m and n ψ 0 is the potential difference between the electrodes m and n recorded just before the shutdown of the primary current ti and ti 1 are the limits of the window wi used for recording the secondary voltage t i 1 t i 100 m s in our case and t denotes time see figs 3 and 4 numerically we can simulate the apparent chargeability signal by the means of a forward modelling code in our case using the finite element method solving for the associated elliptic equation with the appropriate boundary conditions the electric potential is the solution of the following elliptic partial differential equation governing the forward model 9 σ ψ ℑ where σ sm 1 denotes the electrical conductivity of the medium ψ v is the electrical potential and ℑ represents a volumetric source current term a m 3 this source sink term is given by the current injected at a given set of electrodes positive for injection and negative for current retrieval times the delta function localizing the electrodes and using the superposition principle the boundary condition at the ground surface is an insulating boundary condition while the potential vanished to zero in the ground far from the source sink current electrodes the conductivity is in between an instantaneous value σ and a steady state dc value σ 0 σ equation 9 is used to compute the forward response of the medium i e resistance and apparent chargeability as follows 10 r a δ ψ i 11 m a ψ σ 1 m ψ σ ψ σ 1 m where ra in ohm is the apparent resistance δ ψ in v is the electrical potential difference between two voltage electrodes m and n figs 3 and 4 and ma denotes the apparent chargeability dimensionless but often expressed in mv v ψ defines the forward operator given by eq 9 and m dimensionless denotes the intrinsic chargeability of the medium equation 11 is of high convenience because it stipulates that computing the apparent chargeability does not require a new equation beside the one involved for the widely used electrical resistivity tomography for taking into account the polarization effects of the medium we only need to solve the electrical potential elliptic equation twice 3 3 a strategy to interpret the field data from eqs 3 and 5 we can get the distribution of the cec and water content from the normalized chargeability and the instantaneous conductivity according to 12 cec m n θ m 1 ρ g λ 13 θ 1 σ w σ m n r 1 m this can be done for each element of the tomogram then in turn we can use eq 7 to image the permeability field 4 laboratory experiments four samples were cored at the site the experiments were carried out with spring water equilibrated with the rock pore water conductivity 0 0388 s m 1 at 25 c and ph 8 7 8 9 a fifth sample corresponding to a clean carbonate rock was added to the collection of core samples to get the induced polarization properties of the unweathered carbonate rock the porosity of the core samples was estimated with weight and volume measurements the cation exchange capacity was obtained with the cobalthexamine titration method ciesielski et al 1997 the cec of the clay sample c1 is 7 2 meq 100 g while the cec of the travertin is 0 9 meq 100 g and we obtained 0 3 meq 100 g for the limestone frequency domain induced polarization measurements were performed over the frequency range from 10 mhz to 45 khz using the zelsip04 v02 impedance meter zimmermann et al 2008 see fig 5 the complex conductivity spectra are shown in figs 6 and 7 the clayey materials are more conductive and polarizable than the carbonate rocks the clean carbonate rock sample c2 is characterized by very low conductivity and normalized chargeability values because of its porosity the travertine rock sample is quite conductive and it is characterized by a relative low polarization fig 8 shows the normalized chargeability versus the quadrature conductivity according to eq 8 these two parameters are proportional to each other in agreement with the results shown in fig 8 in figs 9 and 10 we compare the dependence of the surface conductivity and quadrature conductivity of our samples on the cation exchange capacity cec we use also data from the literature the data are consistent with the prediction of eqs 3 6 which are predicting a linear relationship between the surface conductivity and quadrature conductivity with the cec these data confirm that induced polarization measurements in the field should be able to discriminate between clay materials and carbonates then eqs 12 and 13 can be used to image the water content and the cec this is done in the next section 5 field data acquisition interpretation and use of petrophysical models 5 1 acquisition of the field data six induced polarization profiles have been laid out in the field with a length of 165 m fig 1d the topography is shown in fig 11 the topography was built from a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 1 m it was difficult to get a better resolution in a woody area the locations of the 384 electrodes and the mesh are shown in fig 12 the mesh was refined around theses electrodes to ensure that the precision of the computations is higher around the points of measurements we collected 5971 resistance and 653 apparent chargeability measurements with an abem sas4000 the number of resistance data was higher because few longer lines were performed with just resistivity measurements the simulation domain is discretized into 14 524 elements and the finite element method is used for the forward modeling fig 12 some examples of decay curves are shown in fig 13 we see the good quality of the measurements 5 2 tomography the inversion was performed with the code described in soueid ahmed et al 2018 2019 we first estimate the conductivity field and then we use it in the estimation the intrinsic chargeability the convergence of the conductivity and chargeability inversion processes has been obtained after 8 iterations fig 14 shows the estimated electrical conductivity distribution the conductivity tomograms put in evidence the presence of a conductive anomaly corresponding to clays below which lies a more resistive carbonate formation similarly fig 15 shows the normalized chargeability clays are more chargeable than carbonates and are therefore characterized by higher normalized chargeabilities the plots of the measured and observed data fig 16 show clear linear trends this means that the computed data match the observed data very well 5 3 use of the petrophysical transforms by using the eqs 12 and 13 we can estimate the water content and cec distributions see figs 17 and 18 as expected the clays appear to have larger water content due to their high water retention ability the cec distribution see fig 18 which is obtained from the water content distribution associates a higher cec reaching 3 meq 100 g to the clays close to the value reported in table 1 7 meq 100 g the estimated permeability magnitudes see fig 19 vary between 10 18 m2 and 10 13 m2 which are very reasonable values for such materials revil and cathles 1999 5 4 normalized chargeability versus conductivity the normalized chargeability versus the conductivity is shown in fig 20 we compare here the field data and the laboratory data there are two poles corresponding to the clay pole and the clean carbonate pole we see that for the clay pole the slope of the trend is close to r 0 10 which means that the conductivity is dominated by the surface conductivity along the surface of the grains for the clean carbonate the conductivity is dominated by the conductivity of the pore water 6 discussion we have no information regarding the failure process except that it has been very likely triggered by the heavy rains during the 10 days preceding the event and in particular the day before the landslide occurs because of a sudden trigger and the clay material liquefied and flow out of the scar damaging the house downslope retrogression see e g torrence 2012 solberg et al 2016 for landslides in clayey materials the hydrologic and geomorphic interaction between landslides and the drainage network is generally very narrow the tomograms of the permeability and water content show that the landslide is located on a preferential flow path with a clay permeability barrier downslope at claix the stratigraphy thus controlled the relative permeability as well as the pore pressures while water flowing from the path could exert a flow force fig 21 the water saturated conditions may have favored deformation accompanying the initiation of the failure and causing microstructural collapse sidle et al 2006 picarelli et al 2012 it could have also generated pore water pressure varying significantly over a period of hours during heavy rainfall due to direct infiltration and surface flow onto the slope that facilitated rapid undrained progress of the failure salciarini et al 2006 tsai et al 2008 not countered by a stop effect of the materials downstream due to the presence of the road cutting the slope the picture shown in fig 22 corroborates it indicating the existence of a small karstic conduit in the position of the landslide we can make the assumption that the karstic conduit formed in the travertine has generated water pore pressure under into the rock mass that initiated the collapse as sketched in fig 21 this would have quickly generated an overpressure allowing the shallow earth materials to slide easily downslope 7 conclusions we investigated the value of induced polarization as a non intrusive auscultation technique to characterize shallow earth materials an application was made on the slope of a woody slope characterized by shallow landslides a few decimeters to a few meters thick we first carried out a petrophysical study using four samples from the test site plus a fifth sample corresponding to a clean carbonate rock similar to the carbonate bedrock known to be present at the site these petrophysical measurements were consistent with a recent mechanistic model called the dynamic stern layer model and used to provide a fundamental mechanistic understanding of induced polarization then we applied this petrophysical model to interpret the conductivity and normalized chargeability tomograms obtained in the field using time domain induced polarization we developed a procedure to image the water content the cation exchange capacity and the permeability distribution at the test site the cation exchange capacity tomogram provides an image of the 3d repartition of the clay in the field the permeability field shows that the landslide is associated with a high permeability channel that could have triggered the landslide during an episode of intense rain these distributions provide some clue regarding the reasons associated with the localization of the landslide a flow pipe has been identified on the exposed material in the scarp let by the landslide as the societal landslide risk will probably increase in the future partly due to the forecast climatic change that may increase the incidence of landslides in many areas geophysics will undoubtedly have a growing place as a tool to understand and diagnose triggering processes high permeability flow path that are channeling ground water can for example be highlighted credit authorship contribution statement a revil methodology writing original draft writing review editing data curation

5287,the development of shallow landslides is strongly connected to the changes in the water content of soils on hillslopes their clay content and permeability distribution which in turn are playing an important role regarding their hydro mechanical properties a non intrusive geophysical method able to map these properties would be very helpful the most common geoelectrical method dc direct current resistivity cannot be used as a stand alone technique for this purpose since it depends on two contributions bulk and surface conductivities which depend on the water content and the cation exchange capacity cec of the material induced polarization is a geophysical method that can be now used to complement dc resistivity in providing key material properties that can be used to diagnose potential risks for failure we first recall the basic principles behind the induced polarization method from laboratory to field scales and key findings in the underlying petrophysics needed to jointly interpret electrical conductivity and normalized chargeability tomograms then we apply these relationships to a field survey carried out over a shallow landslide at claix isère france close to grenoble a 3d induced polarization survey was carried out and interpreted in terms of the clay content water content and permeability distributions we demonstrate that the landslide is associated with a channel of high water content corresponding with the presence of travertine a flow path and a permeability barrier downslope corresponding to the presence of plastic clays this study demonstrates that induced polarization can be used to characterize the impacted volume and therefore might have been useful to map the area before the landslide to assess the possible risk of failure this methodology could play a key role in mitigation planning keywords induced polarization landslides flow path permeability 1 introduction because of the threat that landslides pose to public safety

explain all aspects of induced polarization revil et al 2017a b c and based on a mechanistic understanding of the underlying physico chemistry induced polarization has become a powerful quantitative method useable in the field to characterize landslides and their environments for the first time we present a quantitative investigation of induced polarization phenomena to a shallow landslide in the french alps the present case study corresponds to the case of claix an area already known for its rock slope movements bertran 2003 which was responsible for a death in 2017 we discuss both laboratory

normalized chargeability versus conductivity the normalized chargeability versus the conductivity is shown in fig 20 we compare here the field data and the laboratory data there are two poles corresponding to the clay pole and the clean carbonate pole we see that for the clay pole the slope of the trend is close to r 0 10 which means that the conductivity is dominated by the surface conductivity along the surface of the grains for the clean carbonate the conductivity is dominated by the conductivity of the pore water 6 discussion we have no information regarding the failure process except that it has been very likely triggered by the heavy rains during the 10 days preceding the event and in particular the day before the landslide occurs because of a sudden trigger and the clay material liquefied and flow out of the scar damaging the house downslope retrogression see e g torrence 2012 solberg et al 2016 for landslides in clayey materials the hydrologic and geomorphic interaction between landslides and the drainage network is generally very narrow the tomograms of the permeability and water content show that the landslide is located on a preferential flow path with a clay permeability barrier downslope at claix the stratigraphy thus controlled the relative permeability as well as the pore pressures while water flowing from the path could exert a flow force fig 21 the water saturated conditions may have favored deformation accompanying the initiation of the failure and causing microstructural collapse sidle et al 2006 picarelli et al 2012 it could have also generated pore water pressure varying significantly over a period of hours during heavy rainfall due to direct infiltration and surface flow onto the slope that facilitated rapid undrained progress of the failure salciarini et al 2006 tsai et al 2008 not countered by a stop effect of the materials downstream due to the presence of the road cutting the slope the picture shown in fig 22 corroborates it indicating the existence of a small karstic conduit in the position of the landslide we can make the assumption that the karstic conduit formed in the travertine has generated water pore pressure under into the rock mass that initiated the collapse as sketched in fig 21 this would have quickly generated an overpressure allowing the shallow earth materials to slide easily downslope 7 conclusions we investigated the value of induced polarization as a non intrusive auscultation technique to characterize shallow earth materials an application was made on the slope of a woody slope characterized by shallow landslides a few decimeters to a few meters thick we first carried out a petrophysical study using four samples from the test site plus a fifth sample corresponding to a clean carbonate rock similar to the carbonate bedrock known to be present at the site these petrophysical measurements were consistent with a recent mechanistic model called the dynamic stern layer model and used to provide a fundamental mechanistic understanding of induced polarization then we applied this petrophysical model to interpret the conductivity and normalized chargeability tomograms obtained in the field using time domain induced polarization we developed a procedure to image the water content the cation exchange capacity and the permeability distribution at the test site the cation exchange capacity tomogram provides an image of the 3d repartition of the clay in the field the permeability field shows that the landslide is associated with a high permeability channel that could have triggered the landslide during an episode of intense rain these distributions provide some clue regarding the reasons associated with the localization of the landslide a flow pipe has been identified on the exposed material in the scarp let by the landslide as the societal landslide risk will probably increase in the future partly due to the forecast climatic change that may increase the incidence of landslides in many areas geophysics will undoubtedly have a growing place as a tool to understand and diagnose triggering processes high permeability

5288,estimation of reliable design discharges under variable climate is a key challenge for today s engineers therefore researchers are intensively exploring different alternative approaches in order to improve standard methods for design discharge estimation paper investigates the performance of time invariant time trend and precipitation informed models based on generalized extreme value gev distribution for 31 slovenian discharge gauging stations with data availability from 1961 until 2015 different rainfall durations are used as covariates in the case of precipitation informed models the selected catchments are located in different climate regions and characterized by five flow regimes the results indicate that in most cases precipitation informed models gave better fit to the measured data comparing to time invariant and time trend informed models relative differences in the design discharge estimations associated with 10 and 100 year return periods using time trend and precipitation informed models compared to time invariant model were up to 60 additionally the results indicate that identified best fitting model of individual gauging station can to some extent be related to its flow regime keywords flood change attribution trends flood frequency analysis return period design discharge climate variability 1 introduction numerous studies have investigated trends in meteorological or hydrological variables in the last decades at the local and regional scale for example jones et al 1999 as well as pachauri et al 2014 reported the significant increase in air temperatures around the world warmer atmosphere has greater water holding capacity which may be the reason for more intense meteorological processes causing more frequent and intense precipitation at different locations around the globe dessens 1995 trenberth et al 2003 groisman et al 2005 ipcc 2012 a physical explanation of the impact of global warming on an increase in extreme precipitation can be found in trenberth et al 2003 many researchers reported an increase in heavy precipitation in different parts of the world e g south africa siberia eastern mediterranean central mexico northern japan united states in the last decades sun and groisman 2000 easterling et al 2000 alpert et al 2002 trenberth et al 2003 trenberth et al 2003 also argued that as the consequence of climatic variability changes in extreme precipitation are more likely than changes in annual mean precipitation in the future however pachauri et al 2014 detected also an increase in the mean annual precipitation in the north of europe and a decrease in the south of europe as a consequence of the climate variability also changes in flood discharges could be expected however detected trend in precipitation is difficult to directly relate to the trends in discharges of the rivers because runoff is a complex process and depends also on other factors such as antecedent soil moisture snow melting geological conditions morphology human impacts etc šraj et al 2016b blöschl et al 2017 blöschl et al 2019 according to merz et al 2012 drivers of flood change can be divided into three main groups namely atmospheric catchment and river system processes recent studies have demonstrated that no uniform pattern in trends of flood discharge series can be found around the globe e g douglas et al 2000 zhang et al 2001 kundzewicz et al 2005 stahl et al 2010 hannaford 2015 blöschl et al 2019 this is true for europe as well blöschl et al 2019 identified three regional patterns of both increasing and decreasing trends in flood discharges in europe in the past five decades they reported increasing flood discharges in the northwestern europe as a result of increasing autumn and winter rainfall and on the other hand decreasing flood discharges in medium and large catchments of southern europe as a result of decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation moreover they documented decreasing flood discharges in eastern europe which they attributed to decreasing snow cover and snowmelt as a consequence of warmer climate reported changes in flood discharges may have a noticeable implications on flood protection and flood management in the future blöschl et al 2019 therefore the estimation of future floods and reliable design discharges in variable climate is a key challenge for today s engineers due to demonstrated changes in flood discharge series as a result of changing climate as well as anthropogenic influences in many parts of the world standard methods for estimation of flood risk may no longer be valid e g strupczewski et al 2001 milly et al 2008 villarini et al 2009 vogel et al 2011 merz et al 2012 kjeldsen et al 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 blöschl et al 2015 šraj et al 2016b schlef et al 2018 blöschl et al 2019 therefore we are facing with a problem how to efficiently modify standard methods that are used for the design discharge estimation in response many alternative approaches have been explored in recent years see review papers of khaliq et al 2006 françois et al 2019 a lot of attention has been paid to the so called non stationary frequency analysis methods although several researchers have argued that these models may in some cases highly influence on a reduction of their predictive capabilities e g lins and cohn 2011 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 numerous studies conducted in the last decade exposed the need for the use of modified models in order to improve the estimation of flood quantiles with adjusting them to climate change or anthropogenic impacts e g gilroy and mccuen 2011 lopez and frances 2013 cheng et al 2014 delgado et al 2014 gül et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2014 condon et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 šraj et al 2016b kim et al 2017 luke et al 2017 li et al 2018 bertola et al 2019 steirou et al 2019 most of these studies embedded time trends into parameters of different distribution functions for example delgado et al 2010 implemented a time trend of the mekong river annual maximum discharge series into the location and scale parameter of the generalized extreme value gev distribution they argued that the introduction of a time varying scale parameter in the gev distribution allowed to isolate flood variability from the trend and provided a broader insight into the changes moreover they demonstrated an increasing probability of the occurrence of extreme floods in the last half of the 20th century although the probability of an average flood decreased during the same period employing the time trend informed two parameter lognormal probability distribution function for the flood data series across the us vogel et al 2011 found that today s 100 year flood may become more frequent in the future in many watersheds not only due to the impact of climate change but also other sources of change e g urbanisation strupczewski et al 2001 carried flood frequency analysis ffa with respect to seasonal and annual peak flow series of 38 polish gauging stations using the gamma and log normal probability distribution functions with time trends implementing in the first two parameters of the probability distribution function they argued that in the case that seasonal time series of peak flows exhibit non stationary characteristics the non stationary ffa should be based on the seasonal peak flow series gül et al 2014 performed ffa applying gev cdn gev conditional density estimation network model with parameters allowing to vary with time results indicated the need for considering the time trends of discharges in flood studies additionally to the models with parameters dependent on time also alternative models have been developed correlating the distribution parameters to different other variables such us climatological hydrological or anthropogenic indices e g pacific decadal oscillation pdo southern oscillation index soi mediterranean oscillation index moi north atlantic oscillation nao land use population measures etc for example steirou et al 2019 fitted a climate informed gev models to discharge series of 600 gauging stations in europe using five different covariates namely north atlantic oscillation the east atlantic pattern the east atlantic western russian pattern the scandinavia pattern and the polar eurasian pattern they demonstrated considerably different flood estimates for individual years in some regions such as northwestern scandinavia and the british isles comparing to the results of classical gev model with parameters invariant in time furthermore villarini et al 2009 examined flood peaks change based on a covariate analysis using time population density and daily maximum rainfall for a flood frequency analysis with the generalized additive models for location scale and shape parameters gamlss model for several basins in the us they demonstrated that gamlss is a usable modelling tool for incorporating potential flood change drivers in ffa they concluded that the return interval of extreme events in variable climate can varied dramatically bertola et al 2019 applied two parameter gumbel model for the attribution of flood changes to three potential drivers namely atmospheric catchment and river system to a large number of catchments in upper austria they found out that land use changes did not show significant correlation with flood changes furthermore they argued that annual precipitation is not as good as extreme precipitation in explaining the long term evolution of floods in half of the catchments with detected significant trends in floods the model with extreme precipitation as covariate outperformed the time invariant model due to the fact that previous studies have demonstrated statistically significant trends in annual maximum am flood series for some gauging stations in slovenia kobold et al 2012 bezak et al 2015a b šraj et al 2016a b and the study of šraj et al 2016b have already demonstrated the outperformance of precipitation informed model over the models with time varying distribution parameters for two gauging stations in slovenia the need for further investigation also for other stations has arisen moreover according to luke et al 2017 physically based covariates are proposed to be a better predictor of changes than time trends in case the dominant mechanisms responsible for changes in floods are known furthermore models using shorter durations of precipitation as a covariate rather than annual precipitation were investigated in the study given that extreme floods are in general the consequence of extreme precipitation events as high precipitation is being associated with more efficient runoff generation perdigão and blöschl 2014 thus the main objective of the study is to extend the previous work šraj et al 2016b by comparing time invariant time trend informed and precipitation informed using different precipitation durations models based on the gev distribution for gauging stations in slovenia belonging to different climate zones 2 data and methods in order to investigate the main aim of the presented study 31 catchments located in slovenia europe were selected table 1 shows main characteristics of the considered catchments and fig 1 presents location of discharge gauging stations on the map of slovenia discharge gauging stations were selected based on data availability this means that all stations that have information about annual maximum am peak discharge available for the period from 1961 until 2015 were used in the analysis data was provided by the slovenian environment agency arso 2019 additionally the presence of serial correlation in data series was investigated in order to avoid incorrectly detected significant trends of the mean in time series douglas et al 2000 yue et al 2002 vogel et al 2011 for this purpose the box pierce test box and pierce 1970 ljung and box 1978 and autocorrelation function acf plots were used to examine the null hypothesis of independence a significance level of 1 was applied to remove stations with significant serial correlation finally as a result of above considered conditions a list of 31 stations was defined in general slovenia can be divided into 3 climate zones temperate continental sub mediterranean and mountain e g dolšak et al 2016 ogrin 1996 it should be noted that temperate continental climate covers the largest part of the country which means that most of the catchments are located in this climate type however especially larger catchments such as sava or ljubljanica river catchments with areas of more than 1 500 km2 are belonging to two different climate zones at the same time e g mountain and temperate continental or sub mediterranean and temperate continental annual precipitation in slovenia varies from less than 900 mm per year in the eastern part of the country to more than 3000 mm per year in the western mountainous part table 1 in almost all investigated catchments snow fall can occur and contribute to runoff e g frantar et al 2008 parajka et al 2018 due to these characteristics also various types of flow regimes can be found among the investigated catchments such as alpine nival pluvial alpine pluvial nival dinaric pluvial nival panonnian pluvial nival and meditereranean regime based on the classification done by frantar and hrvatin 2005 thus also flood characteristics among investigated catchment vary relatively significantly e g bezak et al 2015b which can also be seen from fig 2 one can notice that in some specific years e g 1980 1990 2010 almost all gauging stations had the maximum peak discharge values in the same month these are the years in which extreme or even catastrophic flood events occurred in almost all investigated catchments as an extension of the previous work šraj et al 2016b the performance of precipitation informed models where the location parameter was assumed to be a function of precipitation amount of different durations was investigated in this study monthly precipitation amount data was used in order to define the 1 month p1 3 months p3 6 months p6 and 12 months p12 precipitation amounts for corresponding years these monthly values were determined based on the timing of the peak discharge values fig 2 thus p1 is the monthly precipitation in the month with the maximum peak discharge value p3 was defined in similar manner considering seasons i e jan mar apr jun jul sep oct dec furthermore for the p6 values year was divided into two sub sets i e jan jun and jul dec for example if maximum peak discharge value occurred in february then corresponding p1 was monthly precipitation in february p3 was rainfall sum for the january march period and p6 was monthly sum for the january june period p12 variable is annual rainfall for the specific calendar year for this purpose we used interpolated monthly precipitation amounts 1 km grid cell for all months in the period from 1961 until 2015 interpolation based on measured point data was performed by the slovenian environment agency based on the interpolated grid data areal monthly precipitation amounts have been calculated for all selected catchments using catchment boundary information arso 2019 in order to detect trends in the am p1 p3 p6 and p12 samples non parametric mann kendall mk test was applied e g kendall 1975 douglas et al 2000 mk test is one of the most widely accepted tests to detect trends in hydro meteorological data because it is robust against ties in the data and missing values and does not require data normality e g douglas et al 2000 strupczewski et al 2001 bates et al 2010 singh et al 2013 the null hypothesis of the mk test is that there is no monotonic trend present in the investigated sample and the alternative hypothesis states that there is either positive or negative trend present in the data the mk test was carried out using kendall package mcleod 2011 that is implemented in r software r core team 2013 a significance level of 0 01 was applied to identify statistical significance of the trend in order to calculate the significance of linear correlation between the pairs of samples am p1 am p3 am p6 and am p12 function cor test implemented in r software was used r core team 2013 one of the most commonly accepted non stationary models is based on the generalized extreme value gev model katz et al 2002 delgado et al 2010 gilleland and katz 2011 singh et al 2013 gül et al 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 prosdocimi et al 2015 šraj et al 2016b kim et al 2017 steirou et al 2019 the reason for a wide use is skewed character of annual maximum flows and fairly easy inclusion of covariates in the parameters of the gev distribution function šraj et al 2016b the cumulative distribution function cdf of the gev distribution can be defined as 1 f x μ κ e x p 1 κ x μ α 1 κ κ 0 and gev quantile function qf associated with a given return period rt can be defined as 2 x t μ α κ 1 l n t t 1 κ where μ and κ are location scale and shape parameters of the gev distribution respectively more information about gev distribution can be found e g in gilleland and katz 2011 parameters of the gev distribution can be estimated using different methods however the maximum likelihood method mle have already yielded good results in the previous study conducted in slovenia šraj et al 2016b thus it was also applied in this study furthermore mle method is usually applied in the similar studies obeysekera and salas 2014 condon et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 detailed description of the method can be found in coles 2001 the climate induced flood changes and estimates of design discharges of different return periods in changing climate are usually investigated using time trend or climate informed models in case of climate informed models different climate variables are used as covariates in this study we used precipitation as climate variable and compared the following models that are presented in table 2 a log link function was used in the gevt2 model in order to ensure the positive value of the scale parameter α of the gev distribution el adlouni et al 2007 salas and obeysekera 2014 the shape parameter κ of the gev distribution was assumed to be constant which is often an assumption in similar studies e g coles 2001 salas and obeysekera 2014 prosdocimi et al 2015 in order to select the best fitting model for considered catchments akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and bayesian information criterion bic were applied in the first step these tests are commonly performed for model selection in cases where model parameters are estimated using the mle method e g gül et al 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 šraj et al 2016b steirou et al 2019 the model associated with the smallest aic and bic values indicates the best model performance in the second step the initial model choice from the first step was additionally validated with a likelihood ratio test lrt using the significance level of 0 01 the lrt is a simple test procedure which helps selecting the best model between two nested models coles 2001 it was applied to select the best model between stationary model and more complex non stationary models more complex model structure may provide a better fit but added complexity does not necessary bring significant improvement of the model s capacity to explain the data the null hypothesis of the lrt is that the am discharge series follows the time invariant model gev and the alternative hypothesis states that the am discharge series follows one of the time trend and precipitation informed models selected by aic and bic criteria detailed description of testing methods can be found in coles 2001 and wilcox et al 2018 additionally various diagnostic plots based on standardized version of the data e g residual probability plot residual quantile plot were investigated to evaluate the overall performance of the fitted models see coles 2001 all the above mentioned analyses were conducted using r software r core team 2013 and extremes package gilleland and katz 2011 3 results and discussion in the first step of the study the trends in the am discharge series for 31 selected stations were investigated the statistically significant trend results are presented in fig 3 one can notice that for one station 7380 a statistically significant positive trend significance level of 0 01 was detected on the other hand one station 9210 exhibited statistically significant negative trend for the am discharge series among stations with statistically non significant trend 19 stations had negative trend and 9 stations had positive trend in the am discharge series additionally we also investigated trends in the p1 p3 p6 and p12 samples results show that none of the considered stations demonstrated statistically significant trend significance level of 0 01 in precipitation series however additional linear correlation analysis demonstrated obvious relationship between am and precipitation of different durations p1 p3 p6 and p12 for almost all cases in the next step the models presented in table 2 were fitted to the am discharge series of all considered stations figs 4 and 5 show an example of the performance of all considered models for one of the selected gauging stations i e station 7380 gauging station skocjan on the radulja river with statistically significant positive trend this station has been already investigated by šraj et al 2016b but for two years shorter period 1961 2013 however in 2014 the highest flood in the considered period was recorded at the aforementioned gauging station fig 4 furthermore bezak and mikoš 2014 demonstrated that the consideration of one wet year in the data sample could have an influence on the relationship between design variable and return period the results for the station 7380 show that the time invariant gev model significantly underestimate the highest flood that occurred in 2014 as well as the second highest flood from 2010 fig 4 similar findings have been reported by šraj et al 2016b however because of the highest flood in 2014 the underestimation in this study is even more pronounced additional two years of data availability have raised the 100 year flood quantile estimate in time invariant conditions for 13 from 57 m3 s to 64 m3 s incorporation of the time trend into the location parameter of the model gevt did not improve the results significantly however further incorporation of the time trend into the scale parameter of gevt2 model yields a significant improvement over the gev and gevt models according to the selected criteria in the case of the station 7380 estimated 100 year flood according to the gevt2 model is 70 m3 s this is in accordance with detected variability of floods for this station showing an increase of floods during the 21st century in fact seven of the highest 10 floods at this station in the considered period 1961 2015 occurred after 2004 the inclusion of precipitation as a covariate into the location parameter did not demonstrate a significant improvement over the time trend informed gevt2 model in the case of the gauging station 7380 however this station was one of two out of 31 where time trend informed model gevt2 yielded the best fit the second best fit for this station gave gevp6 model the results of the precipitation informed models for the station 7380 are presented in fig 5 the results demonstrate that 100 year flood in time invariant conditions 64 m3 s corresponds to a flood associated with rainfall p1 of 265 mm p3 of 417 mm p6 of 555 mm and p12 of 1031 mm according to the gevp1 gevp3 gevp6 and gevp12 respectively these values of precipitation correspond to 93rd 81st 26th and 19th percentile of measured precipitation 1961 2015 for the station 7380 it should be noted that average precipitation p1 p3 p6 and p12 of the corresponding duration for the considered catchment is 154 mm 346 mm 639 mm and 1159 mm respectively the results of precipitation informed models demonstrate that 100 year flood in time invariant conditions 64 m3 s is underestimated as in case of p6 and p12 already below average precipitation causes aforementioned discharge fig 5 each additional 100 mm of precipitation p1 p3 p6 and p12 increases the 100 year flood quantiles by 5 7 4 4 3 6 and 2 6 m3 s respectively in case of maximum observed values of p1 p3 p6 and p12 299 mm 592 mm 878 mm and 1447 mm in the period 1961 2015 the 100 year discharge of 64 m3 s would have the return periods of 80 40 45 and 40 years respectively fig 5 using the selected criteria where aic bic and lrt were considered the best fitting model was identified for each individual station fig 3 shows the results of this procedure the time invariant gev model was identified as the best fitting model according to the selected lrt criteria only for one 5770 of the considered stations and time trend informed gevt model for none of them according to the lrt the inclusion of the time trend into the location parameter gevt resulted in a significant improvement over the time invariant gev model only for the stations with significant trend in am discharge series 7380 9210 additional inclusion of the time trend into the scale parameter gevt2 yielded further improvement for some of the stations in fact for two stations 4480 7380 gevt2 model yielded the best performance fig 3 it is worth to mention that both stations demonstrated significant p value 0 008 or almost significant p value 0 015 trend in am discharge series furthermore the inclusion of precipitation as a covariate into the location parameter demonstrated further improvement over the time trend informed models for most of the considered stations except previous mentioned two however for both stations gevp6 model demonstrated the second best fit fig 6 shows comparison among all tested models according to the models ranking based on the aic results using violin plots as it can be seen all four precipitation informed models generally yielded better fit to the data than other tested models it should be noted that differences in the aic and bic values between precipitation informed models and other three tested models were mostly larger than 10 which means that based on available guidelines e g hilbe 2011 the model with the lowest aic or bic value should be preferred quite interestingly according to the median rank aic values the gev model outperforms the gevt and gevt2 models however in case of some stations differences among the aic and bic results for different models were smaller than 10 which could indicate that there is no significant difference among models e g hilbe 2011 similarly according to the median aic value gevp6 model yields better performance than other three tested precipitation informed models again differences in the aic and bic results among these models were mostly smaller than 10 as presented in fig 3 gevp3 and gevp6 models were selected as the most suitable for 8 gauging stations each gevp12 for 7 gauging stations and gevp1 for 5 stations these results demonstrate that for almost all stations precipitation informed models exhibit better fitting than time trend informed models or time invariant model this is consistent with the results from some previous studies prosdocimi et al 2014 bertola et al 2019 it is interesting that also for the stations with statistically non significant trend in am series precipitation informed models outperformed time invariant model a fact which has also been reported by bertola et al 2019 for some austrian catchments they argued that through precipitation informed models long term flood fluctuations are related to the covariates even in cases where no statistically significant trend in time is detected their finding is in accordance with the finding of this study since stations where gevp1 gevp3 gevp6 and gevp12 models yielded the best performance in general had statistically significant correlations for the am p1 am p3 am p6 and am p12 samples in most cases the higher correlation was also connected to the best model performance this means that in case the correlation for the am p12 sample was the highest higher than for am p6 am p3 and am p1 samples the gevp12 model also yielded the best performance according to the selected criteria the results demonstrate that the choice of the best fitting model is to some extent connected also with the flow regime for most of the gauging stations at the rivers with mediterranean south western part of slovenia or panonnian pluvial nival north eastern part regime and one of the stations at the rivers with dinaric pluvial nival regime southern part gevp12 model exhibit the best fit fig 3 on the other hand for most of the stations at the rivers with alpine nival pluvial regime northern part gevp3 model demonstrate the best fit gevp1 and gevp6 models gave the best fit mostly to the stations at the rivers with alpine pluvial nival and dinaric pluvial nival regime however it should also be noted that these two regimes cover the largest part of the country and larger number of stations is characterized by these two regimes nevertheless a possible reason for such behaviour could be that catchments with slower runoff response i e panonnian and mediterranean regimes are mainly related to the precipitation informed models with annual rainfall p12 and catchments in the north west and central part of the country i e alpine nival pluvial alpine pluvial nival and dinaric pluvial nival are to a greater extent related to the precipitation informed models with shorter rainfall durations i e p6 p3 p1 this is in accordance with the results of bezak et al 2015b who carried out classification of slovene catchments based on catchment area strength of flood seasonality and flood timescale which was defined as ratio between runoff volume and peak discharge the results of this study also demonstrate that stations with less explicit seasonality are more closely related to the precipitation informed models with longer durations further investigation of the results of time trend informed models demonstrates that the relative differences of the flood quantiles associated with 10 and 100 year return periods for the past and future time regarding to the current situation i e year 2015 using the gevt2 model are higher comparing to changes given by gevt model larger relative differences were expected since gevt2 model also accounts for the time variability of the scale parameter of the gev distribution in addition to the station 7380 with statistically significant increasing trend in am flood series also some stations with statistically non significant trends in am series demonstrate relatively large differences between flood quantiles comparing past and current situation for both considered return periods e g stations 4480 5770 fig 7 on the other hand station 9210 with statistically significant decreasing trend in am flood series demonstrates almost no changes in this case additional comparison of time trend informed model results with time invariant model results demonstrate that for the stations yielding the highest differences between the flood quantiles of the past and current situation i e year 2015 fig 7 also considerable changes in the return period of flood quantiles were detected for example in the case of the station 7380 with statistically significant increasing trend in flood series a flood with the return period of 100 years under time invariant conditions becomes today a flood with the return period of only 23 years using time trend informed gevt2 model which gave the best fit to the flood data at this station the changes are even more pronounced in the case of the station 4480 despite the fact that trend in am flood series was statistically non significant at the significance level of 0 01 p value 0 015 in case of this station 100 year return period under time invariant conditions changes to the return period of 15 years applying the best fitting gevt2 model in other words an exceedance probability increased from 0 01 to 0 07 demonstrated changes are consistent with the results of salas and obeysekera 2014 4 conclusions comparison of time invariant time trend informed and precipitation informed using different precipitation durations models based on the gev distribution fitted to the am series of 31 gauging stations in slovenia for the period from 1961 until 2015 was conducted in the study based on the aic and bic criteria as well as the lrt the best fitting model was identified for each individual station results demonstrate that for almost all considered stations precipitation informed models gevp1 gevp3 gevp6 and gevp12 yielded better fitting than time trend informed models gevt gevt2 and time invariant model gev as time invariant gev was identified as the best fitting model for only one station and time trend informed gevt model for none of the stations according to the selected criteria furthermore in the case of two stations which demonstrated significant p value 0 008 or almost significant p value 0 015 trend in am discharge series the time trend informed model gevt2 with additional inclusion of the time trend into the scale parameter outperformed the precipitation informed models detailed investigation of the results of time trend informed models for two mentioned stations related to the flood quantiles associated with 10 and 100 year return periods for the past and future time regarding to the current situation demonstrated large relative differences even more pronounced applying gevt2 model for example a flood with the return period of 100 years under time invariant conditions becomes today a flood with the return period of only 23 years in case of station 7380 and 15 years in case of station 4480 applying the best fitting gevt2 model if we want to ensure today s level of flood protection associated with a return period of 100 years under variable climate conditions after 10 years the design discharge should be increased by almost 20 and 38 for stations 7380 and 4480 respectively moreover additional comparison of the results with the results of the previous study of šraj et al 2016b demonstrates that in climate variable conditions additional new data can significantly influence on the estimated flood quantiles as only two additional new years of data increased the 100 year flood quantile for 13 and 12 applying time invariant and time variable conditions gevt2 respectively comparison of precipitation informed models based on precipitation with different durations 1 3 6 12 months as a covariate demonstrates that gevp3 gevp6 models were selected as the best fitting models according to the selected criteria for 8 gauging stations each gevp12 for 7 gauging stations whereas gevp1 model was selected for 5 gauging stations in most cases the higher correlation between am series and corresponding precipitation of the selected duration matches to the corresponding best fitting model furthermore the results of the study illustrate that identified best fitting model of individual gauging station is to some extent connected also with the flow regime as for most of the stations with the same flow regime also the same best fitting distribution was identified however it should be noted that differences in the aic and bic results in case of the precipitation informed models were in most cases smaller than 10 hilbe 2011 which could indicate that all precipitation informed models yield similar fit to the data we can conclude that precipitation informed models can in most cases adequately simulate the variability of floods in a changing climate even more successfully than time trend informed models furthermore the results of the study confirm the finding of bertola et al 2019 who argued that precipitation informed models are able to simulate long term flood fluctuations even in cases where no statistically significant trend in am series is detected credit authorship contribution statement mojca šraj conceptualization writing original

5288,estimation of reliable design discharges under variable climate is a key challenge for today s engineers therefore researchers are intensively exploring different alternative approaches in order to improve standard methods for design discharge estimation paper investigates the performance of time invariant time trend and precipitation informed models based on generalized extreme value gev distribution for 31 slovenian discharge gauging stations with data availability from 1961 until 2015 different rainfall durations are used as covariates in the case of precipitation informed models the selected catchments are located in different climate regions and characterized by five flow regimes the results indicate that in most cases precipitation informed models gave better fit to the measured data comparing to time invariant and time trend informed models relative differences in the design discharge estimations associated with 10 and 100 year return periods using time trend and precipitation informed models compared to time invariant model were up to 60 additionally the results indicate that identified best fitting model of individual gauging station can to some extent be related to its flow regime keywords flood change attribution trends flood frequency analysis return period design discharge climate variability 1 introduction numerous studies have investigated trends in meteorological or hydrological variables in the last decades at the local and regional scale for example jones et al 1999 as well as pachauri et al 2014 reported the significant increase in air temperatures around the world warmer atmosphere has greater water holding capacity which may be the reason for more intense meteorological processes causing more frequent and intense precipitation at different locations around the globe dessens 1995 trenberth et al 2003 groisman et al 2005 ipcc 2012 a physical explanation of the impact of global warming on an increase in extreme precipitation can be found in trenberth et al 2003 many researchers reported an increase in heavy precipitation in different parts of the world e g south africa siberia eastern mediterranean central mexico northern japan united states in the last decades sun and groisman 2000 easterling et al 2000 alpert et al 2002 trenberth et al 2003 trenberth et al 2003 also argued that as the consequence of climatic variability changes in extreme precipitation are more likely than changes in annual mean precipitation in the future however pachauri et al 2014 detected also an increase in the mean annual precipitation in the north of europe and a decrease in the south of europe as a consequence of the climate variability also changes in flood discharges could be expected however detected trend in precipitation is difficult to directly relate to the trends in discharges of the rivers because runoff is a complex process and depends also on other factors such as antecedent soil moisture snow melting geological conditions morphology human impacts etc šraj et al 2016b blöschl et al 2017 blöschl et al 2019 according to merz et al 2012 drivers of flood change can be divided into three main groups namely atmospheric catchment and river system processes recent studies have demonstrated that no uniform pattern in trends of flood discharge series can be found around the globe e g douglas et al 2000 zhang et al 2001 kundzewicz et al 2005 stahl et al 2010 hannaford 2015 blöschl et al 2019 this is true for europe as well blöschl et al 2019 identified three regional patterns of both increasing and decreasing trends in flood discharges in europe in the past five decades they reported increasing flood discharges in the northwestern europe as a result of increasing autumn and winter rainfall and on the other hand decreasing flood discharges in medium and large catchments of southern europe as a result of decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation moreover they documented decreasing flood discharges in eastern europe which they attributed to decreasing snow cover and snowmelt as a consequence of warmer climate reported changes in flood discharges may have a noticeable implications on flood protection and flood management in the future blöschl et al 2019 therefore the estimation of future floods and reliable design discharges in variable climate is a key challenge for today s engineers due to demonstrated changes in flood discharge series as a result of changing climate as well as anthropogenic influences in many parts of the world standard methods for estimation of flood risk may no longer be valid e g strupczewski et al 2001 milly et al 2008 villarini et al 2009 vogel et al 2011 merz et al 2012 kjeldsen et al 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 blöschl et al 2015 šraj et al 2016b schlef et al 2018 blöschl et al 2019 therefore we are facing with a problem how to efficiently modify standard methods that are used for the design discharge estimation in response many alternative approaches have been explored in recent years see review papers of khaliq et al 2006 françois et al 2019 a lot of attention has been paid to the so called non stationary frequency analysis methods although several researchers have argued that these models may in some cases highly influence on a reduction of their predictive capabilities e g lins and cohn 2011 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 numerous studies conducted in the last decade exposed the need for the use of modified models in order to improve the estimation of flood quantiles with adjusting them to climate change or anthropogenic impacts e g gilroy and mccuen 2011 lopez and frances 2013 cheng et al 2014 delgado et al 2014 gül et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2014 condon et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 šraj et al 2016b kim et al 2017 luke et al 2017 li et al 2018 bertola et al 2019 steirou et al 2019 most of these studies embedded time trends into parameters of different distribution functions for example delgado et al 2010 implemented a time trend of the mekong river annual maximum discharge series into the location and scale parameter of the generalized extreme value gev distribution they argued that the introduction of a time varying scale parameter in the gev distribution allowed to isolate flood variability from the trend and provided a broader insight into the changes moreover they demonstrated an increasing probability of the occurrence of extreme floods in the last half of the 20th century although the probability of an average flood decreased during the same period employing the time trend informed two parameter lognormal probability distribution function for the flood data series across the us vogel et al 2011 found that today s 100 year flood may become more frequent in the future in many watersheds not only due to the impact of climate change but also other sources of change e g urbanisation strupczewski et al 2001 carried flood frequency analysis ffa with respect to seasonal and annual peak flow series of 38 polish gauging stations using the gamma and log normal probability distribution functions with time trends implementing in the first two parameters of the probability distribution function they argued that in the case that seasonal time series of peak flows exhibit non stationary characteristics the non stationary ffa should be based on the seasonal peak flow series gül et al 2014 performed ffa applying gev cdn gev conditional density estimation network model with parameters allowing to vary with time results indicated the need for considering the time trends of discharges in flood studies additionally to the models with parameters dependent on time also alternative models have been developed correlating the distribution parameters to different other variables such us climatological hydrological or anthropogenic indices e g pacific decadal oscillation pdo southern oscillation index soi mediterranean oscillation index moi north atlantic oscillation nao land use population measures etc for example steirou et al 2019 fitted a climate informed gev models to discharge series of 600 gauging stations in europe using five different covariates namely north atlantic oscillation the east atlantic pattern the east atlantic western russian pattern the scandinavia pattern and the polar eurasian pattern they demonstrated considerably different flood estimates for individual years in some regions such as northwestern scandinavia and the british isles comparing to the results of classical gev model with parameters invariant in time furthermore villarini et al 2009 examined flood peaks change based on a covariate analysis using time population density and daily maximum rainfall for a flood frequency analysis with the generalized additive models for location scale and shape parameters gamlss model for several basins in the us they demonstrated that gamlss is a usable modelling tool for incorporating potential flood change drivers in ffa they concluded that the return interval of extreme events in variable climate can varied dramatically bertola et al 2019 applied two parameter gumbel model for the attribution of flood changes to three potential drivers namely atmospheric catchment and river system to a large number of catchments in upper austria they found out that land use changes did not show significant correlation with flood changes furthermore they argued that annual precipitation is not as good as extreme precipitation in explaining the long term evolution of floods in half of the catchments with detected significant trends in floods the model with extreme precipitation as covariate outperformed the time invariant model due to the fact that previous studies have demonstrated statistically significant trends in annual maximum am flood series for some gauging stations in slovenia kobold et al 2012 bezak et al 2015a b šraj et al 2016a b and the study of šraj et al 2016b have already demonstrated the outperformance of precipitation informed model over the models with time varying distribution parameters for two gauging stations in slovenia the need for further investigation also for other stations has arisen moreover according to luke et al 2017 physically based covariates are proposed to be a better predictor of changes than time trends in case the dominant mechanisms responsible for changes in floods are known furthermore models using shorter durations of precipitation as a covariate rather than annual precipitation were investigated in the study given that extreme floods are in general the consequence of extreme precipitation events as high precipitation is being associated with more efficient runoff generation perdigão and blöschl 2014 thus the main objective of the study is to extend the previous work šraj et al 2016b by comparing time invariant time trend informed and precipitation informed using different precipitation durations models based on the gev distribution for gauging stations in slovenia belonging to different climate zones 2 data and methods in order to investigate the main aim of the presented study 31 catchments located in slovenia europe were selected table 1 shows main characteristics of the considered catchments and fig 1 presents location of discharge gauging stations on the map of slovenia discharge gauging stations were selected based on data availability this means that all stations that have information about annual maximum am peak discharge available for the period from 1961 until 2015 were used in the analysis data was provided by the slovenian environment agency arso 2019 additionally the presence of serial correlation in data series was investigated in order to avoid incorrectly detected significant trends of the mean in time series douglas et al 2000 yue et al 2002 vogel et al 2011 for this purpose the box pierce test box and pierce 1970 ljung and box 1978 and autocorrelation function acf plots were used to examine the null hypothesis of independence a significance level of 1 was applied to remove stations with significant serial correlation finally as a result of above considered conditions a list of 31 stations was defined in general slovenia can be divided into 3 climate zones temperate continental sub mediterranean and mountain e g dolšak et al 2016 ogrin 1996 it should be noted that temperate continental climate covers the largest part of the country which means that most of the catchments are located in this climate type however especially larger catchments such as sava or ljubljanica river catchments with areas of more than 1 500 km2 are belonging to two different climate zones at the same time e g mountain and temperate continental or sub mediterranean and temperate continental annual precipitation in slovenia varies from less than 900 mm per year in the eastern part of the country to more than 3000 mm per year in the western mountainous part table 1 in almost all investigated catchments snow fall can occur and contribute to runoff e g frantar et al 2008 parajka et al 2018 due to these characteristics also various types of flow regimes can be found among the investigated catchments such as alpine nival pluvial alpine pluvial nival dinaric pluvial nival panonnian pluvial nival and meditereranean regime based on the classification done by frantar and hrvatin 2005 thus also flood characteristics among investigated catchment vary relatively significantly e g bezak et al 2015b which can also be seen from fig 2 one can notice that in some specific years e g 1980 1990 2010 almost all gauging stations had the maximum peak discharge values in the same month these are the years in which extreme or even catastrophic flood events occurred in almost all investigated catchments as an extension of the previous work šraj et al 2016b the performance of precipitation informed models where the location parameter was assumed to be a function of precipitation amount of different durations was investigated in this study monthly precipitation amount data was used in order to define the 1 month p1 3 months p3 6 months p6 and 12 months p12 precipitation amounts for corresponding years these monthly values were determined based on the timing of the peak discharge values fig 2 thus p1 is the monthly precipitation in the month with the maximum peak discharge value p3 was defined in similar manner considering seasons i e jan mar apr jun jul sep oct dec furthermore for the p6 values year was divided into two sub sets i e jan jun and jul dec for example if maximum peak discharge value occurred in february then corresponding p1 was monthly precipitation in february p3 was rainfall sum for the january march period and p6 was monthly sum for the january june period p12 variable is annual rainfall for the specific calendar year for this purpose we used interpolated monthly precipitation amounts 1 km grid cell for all months in the period from 1961 until 2015 interpolation based on measured point data was performed by the slovenian environment agency based on the interpolated grid data areal monthly precipitation amounts have been calculated for all selected catchments using catchment boundary information arso 2019 in order to detect trends in the am p1 p3 p6 and p12 samples non parametric mann kendall mk test was applied e g kendall 1975 douglas et al 2000 mk test is one of the most widely accepted tests to detect trends in hydro meteorological data because it is robust against ties in the data and missing values and does not require data normality e g douglas et al 2000 strupczewski et al 2001 bates et al 2010 singh et al 2013 the null hypothesis of the mk test is that there is no monotonic trend present in the investigated sample and the alternative hypothesis states that there is either positive or negative trend present in the data the mk test was carried out using kendall package mcleod 2011 that is implemented in r software r core team 2013 a significance level of 0 01 was applied to identify statistical significance of the trend in order to calculate the significance of linear correlation between the pairs of samples am p1 am p3 am p6 and am p12 function cor test implemented in r software was used r core team 2013 one of the most commonly accepted non stationary models is based on the generalized extreme value gev model katz et al 2002 delgado et al 2010 gilleland and katz 2011 singh et al 2013 gül et al 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 prosdocimi et al 2015 šraj et al 2016b kim et al 2017 steirou et al 2019 the reason for a wide use is skewed character of annual maximum flows and fairly easy inclusion of covariates in the parameters of the gev distribution function šraj et al 2016b the cumulative distribution function cdf of the gev distribution can be defined as 1 f x μ κ e x p 1 κ x μ α 1 κ κ 0 and gev quantile function qf associated with a given return period rt can be defined as 2 x t μ α κ 1 l n t t 1 κ where μ and κ are location scale and shape parameters of the gev distribution respectively more information about gev distribution can be found e g in gilleland and katz 2011 parameters of the gev distribution can be estimated using different methods however the maximum likelihood method mle have already yielded good results in the previous study conducted in slovenia šraj et al 2016b thus it was also applied in this study furthermore mle method is usually applied in the similar studies obeysekera and salas 2014 condon et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 detailed description of the method can be found in coles 2001 the climate induced flood changes and estimates of design discharges of different return periods in changing climate are usually investigated using time trend or climate informed models in case of climate informed models different climate variables are used as covariates in this study we used precipitation as climate variable and compared the following models that are presented in table 2 a log link function was used in the gevt2 model in order to ensure the positive value of the scale parameter α of the gev distribution el adlouni et al 2007 salas and obeysekera 2014 the shape parameter κ of the gev distribution was assumed to be constant which is often an assumption in similar studies e g coles 2001 salas and obeysekera 2014 prosdocimi et al 2015 in order to select the best fitting model for considered catchments akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and bayesian information criterion bic were applied in the first step these tests are commonly performed for model selection in cases where model parameters are estimated using the mle method e g gül et al 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 šraj et al 2016b steirou et al 2019 the model associated with the smallest aic and bic values indicates the best model performance in the second step the initial model choice from the first step was additionally validated with a likelihood ratio test lrt using the significance level of 0 01 the lrt is a simple test procedure which helps selecting the best model between two nested models coles 2001 it was applied to select the best model between stationary model and more complex non stationary models more complex model structure may provide a better fit but added complexity does not necessary bring significant improvement of the model s capacity to explain the data the null hypothesis of the lrt is that the am discharge series follows the time invariant model gev and the alternative hypothesis states that the am discharge series follows one of the time trend and precipitation informed models selected by aic and bic criteria detailed description of testing methods can be found in coles 2001 and wilcox et al 2018 additionally various diagnostic plots based on standardized version of the data e g residual probability plot residual quantile plot were investigated to evaluate the overall performance of the fitted models see coles 2001 all the above mentioned analyses were conducted using r software r core team 2013 and extremes package gilleland and katz 2011 3 results and discussion in the first step of the study the trends in the am discharge series for 31 selected stations were investigated the statistically significant trend results are presented in fig 3 one can notice that for one station 7380 a statistically significant positive trend significance level of 0 01 was detected on the other hand one station 9210 exhibited statistically significant negative trend for the am discharge series among stations with statistically non significant trend 19 stations had negative trend and 9 stations had positive trend in the am discharge series additionally we also investigated trends in the p1 p3 p6 and p12 samples results show that none of the considered stations demonstrated statistically significant trend significance level of 0 01 in precipitation series however additional linear correlation analysis demonstrated obvious relationship between am and precipitation of different durations p1 p3 p6 and p12 for almost all cases in the next step the models presented in table 2 were fitted to the am discharge series of all considered stations figs 4 and 5 show an example of the performance of all considered models for one of the selected gauging stations i e station 7380 gauging station skocjan on the radulja river with statistically significant positive trend this station has been already investigated by šraj et al 2016b but for two years shorter period 1961 2013 however in 2014 the highest flood in the considered period was recorded at the aforementioned gauging station fig 4 furthermore bezak and mikoš 2014 demonstrated that the consideration of one wet year in the data sample could have an influence on the relationship between design variable and return period the results for the station 7380 show that the time invariant gev model significantly underestimate the highest flood that occurred in 2014 as well as the second highest flood from 2010 fig 4 similar findings have been reported by šraj et al 2016b however because of the highest flood in 2014 the underestimation in this study is even more pronounced additional two years of data availability have raised the 100 year flood quantile estimate in time invariant conditions for 13 from 57 m3 s to 64 m3 s incorporation of the time trend into the location parameter of the model gevt did not improve the results significantly however further incorporation of the time trend into the scale parameter of gevt2 model yields a significant improvement over the gev and gevt models according to the selected criteria in the case of the station 7380 estimated 100 year flood according to the gevt2 model is 70 m3 s this is in accordance with detected variability of floods for this station showing an increase of floods during the 21st century in fact seven of the highest 10 floods at this station in the considered period 1961 2015 occurred after 2004 the inclusion of precipitation as a covariate into the location parameter did not demonstrate a significant improvement over the time trend informed gevt2 model in the case of the gauging station 7380 however this station was one of two out of 31 where time trend informed model gevt2 yielded the best fit the second best fit for this station gave gevp6 model the results of the precipitation informed models for the station 7380 are presented in fig 5 the results demonstrate that 100 year flood in time invariant conditions 64 m3 s corresponds to a flood associated with rainfall p1 of 265 mm p3 of 417 mm p6 of 555 mm and p12 of 1031 mm according to the gevp1 gevp3 gevp6 and gevp12 respectively these values of precipitation correspond to 93rd 81st 26th and 19th percentile of measured precipitation 1961 2015 for the station 7380 it should be noted that average precipitation p1 p3 p6 and p12 of the corresponding duration for the considered catchment is 154 mm 346 mm 639 mm and 1159 mm respectively the results of precipitation informed models demonstrate that 100 year flood in time invariant conditions 64 m3 s is underestimated as in case of p6 and p12 already below average precipitation causes aforementioned discharge fig 5 each additional 100 mm of precipitation p1 p3 p6 and p12 increases the 100 year flood quantiles by 5 7 4 4 3 6 and 2 6 m3 s respectively in case of maximum observed values of p1 p3 p6 and p12 299 mm 592 mm 878 mm and 1447 mm in the period 1961 2015 the 100 year discharge of 64 m3 s would have the return periods of 80 40 45 and 40 years respectively fig 5 using the selected criteria where aic bic and lrt were considered the best fitting model was identified for each individual station fig 3 shows the results of this procedure the time invariant gev model was identified as the best fitting model according to the selected lrt criteria only for one 5770 of the considered stations and time trend informed gevt model for none of them according to the lrt the inclusion of the time trend into the location parameter gevt resulted in a significant improvement over the time invariant gev model only for the stations with significant trend in am discharge series 7380 9210 additional inclusion of the time trend into the scale parameter gevt2 yielded further improvement for some of the stations in fact for two stations 4480 7380 gevt2 model yielded the best performance fig 3 it is worth to mention that both stations demonstrated significant p value 0 008 or almost significant p value 0 015 trend in am discharge series furthermore the inclusion of precipitation as a covariate into the location parameter demonstrated further improvement over the time trend informed models for most of the considered stations except previous mentioned two however for both stations gevp6 model demonstrated the second best fit fig 6 shows comparison among all tested models according to the models ranking based on the aic results using violin plots as it can be seen all four precipitation informed models generally yielded better fit to the data than other tested models it should be noted that differences in the aic and bic values between precipitation informed models and other three tested models were mostly larger than 10 which means that based on available guidelines e g hilbe 2011 the model with the lowest aic or bic value should be preferred quite interestingly according to the median rank aic values the gev model outperforms the gevt and gevt2 models however in case of some stations differences among the aic and bic results for different models were smaller than 10 which could indicate that there is no significant difference among models e g hilbe 2011 similarly according to the median aic value gevp6 model yields better performance than other three tested precipitation informed models again differences in the aic and bic results among these models were mostly smaller than 10 as presented in fig 3 gevp3 and gevp6 models were selected as the most suitable for 8 gauging stations each gevp12 for 7 gauging stations and gevp1 for 5 stations these results demonstrate that for almost all stations precipitation informed models exhibit better fitting than time trend informed models or time invariant model this is consistent with the results from some previous studies prosdocimi et al 2014 bertola et al 2019 it is interesting that also for the stations with statistically non significant trend in am series precipitation informed models outperformed time invariant model a fact which has also been reported by bertola et al 2019 for some austrian catchments they argued that through precipitation informed models long term flood fluctuations are related to the covariates even in cases where no statistically significant trend in time is detected their finding is in accordance with the finding of this study since stations where gevp1 gevp3 gevp6 and gevp12 models yielded the best performance in general had statistically significant correlations for the am p1 am p3 am p6 and am p12 samples in most cases the higher correlation was also connected to the best model performance this means that in case the correlation for the am p12 sample was the highest higher than for am p6 am p3 and am p1 samples the gevp12 model also yielded the best performance according to the selected criteria the results demonstrate that the choice of the best fitting model is to some extent connected also with the flow regime for most of the gauging stations at the rivers with mediterranean south western part of slovenia or panonnian pluvial nival north eastern part regime and one of the stations at the rivers with dinaric pluvial nival regime southern part gevp12 model exhibit the best fit fig 3 on the other hand for most of the stations at the rivers with alpine nival pluvial regime northern part gevp3 model demonstrate the best fit gevp1 and gevp6 models gave the best fit mostly to the stations at the rivers with alpine pluvial nival and dinaric pluvial nival regime however it should also be noted that these two regimes cover the largest part of the country and larger number of stations is characterized by these two regimes nevertheless a possible reason for such behaviour could be that catchments with slower runoff response i e panonnian and mediterranean regimes are mainly related to the precipitation informed models with annual rainfall p12 and catchments in the north west and central part of the country i e alpine nival pluvial alpine pluvial nival and dinaric pluvial nival are to a greater extent related to the precipitation informed models with shorter rainfall durations i e p6 p3 p1 this is in accordance with the results of bezak et al 2015b who carried out classification of slovene catchments based on catchment area strength of flood seasonality and flood timescale which was defined as ratio between runoff volume and peak discharge the results of this study also demonstrate that stations with less explicit seasonality are more closely related to the precipitation informed models with longer durations further investigation of the results of time trend informed models demonstrates that the relative differences of the flood quantiles associated with 10 and 100 year return periods for the past and future time regarding to the current situation i e year 2015 using the gevt2 model are higher comparing to changes given by gevt model larger relative differences were expected since gevt2 model also accounts for the time variability of the scale parameter of the gev distribution in addition to the station 7380 with statistically significant increasing trend in am flood series also some stations with statistically non significant trends in am series demonstrate relatively large differences between flood quantiles comparing past and current situation for both considered return periods e g stations 4480 5770 fig 7 on the other hand station 9210 with statistically significant decreasing trend in am flood series demonstrates almost no changes in this case additional comparison of time trend informed model results with time invariant model results demonstrate that for the stations yielding the highest differences between the flood quantiles of the past and current situation i e year 2015 fig 7 also considerable changes in the return period of flood quantiles were detected for example in the case of the station 7380 with statistically significant increasing trend in flood series a flood with the return period of 100 years under time invariant conditions becomes today a flood with the return period of only 23 years using time trend informed gevt2 model which gave the best fit to the flood data at this station the changes are even more pronounced in the case of the station 4480 despite the fact that trend in am flood series was statistically non significant at the significance level of 0 01 p value 0 015 in case of this station 100 year return period under time invariant conditions changes to the return period of 15 years applying the best fitting gevt2 model in other words an exceedance probability increased from 0 01 to 0 07 demonstrated changes are consistent with the results of salas and obeysekera 2014 4 conclusions comparison of time invariant time trend informed and precipitation informed using different precipitation durations models based on the gev distribution fitted to the am series of 31 gauging stations in slovenia for the period from 1961 until 2015 was conducted in the study based on the aic and bic criteria as well as the lrt the best fitting model was identified for each individual station results demonstrate that for almost all considered stations precipitation informed models gevp1 gevp3 gevp6 and gevp12 yielded better fitting than time trend informed models gevt gevt2 and time invariant model gev as time invariant gev was identified as the best fitting model for only one station and time trend informed gevt model for none of the stations according to the selected criteria furthermore in the case of two stations which demonstrated significant p value 0 008 or almost significant p value 0 015 trend in am discharge series the time trend informed model gevt2 with additional inclusion of the time trend into the scale parameter outperformed the precipitation informed models detailed investigation of the results of time trend informed models for two mentioned stations related to the flood quantiles associated with 10 and 100 year return periods for the past and future time regarding to the current situation demonstrated large relative differences even more pronounced applying gevt2 model for example a flood with the return period of 100 years under time invariant conditions becomes today a flood with the return period of only 23 years in case of station 7380 and 15 years in case of station 4480 applying the best fitting gevt2 model if we want to ensure today s level of flood protection associated with a return period of 100 years under variable climate conditions after 10 years the design discharge should be increased by almost 20 and 38 for stations 7380 and 4480 respectively moreover additional comparison of the results with the results of the previous study of šraj et al 2016b demonstrates that in climate variable conditions additional new data can significantly influence on the estimated flood quantiles as only two additional new years of data increased the 100 year flood quantile for 13 and 12 applying time invariant and time variable conditions gevt2 respectively comparison of precipitation informed models based on precipitation with different durations 1 3 6 12 months as a covariate demonstrates that gevp3 gevp6 models were selected as the best fitting models according to the selected criteria for 8 gauging stations each gevp12 for 7 gauging stations whereas gevp1 model was selected for 5 gauging stations in most cases the higher correlation between am series and corresponding precipitation of the selected duration matches to the corresponding best fitting model furthermore the results of the study illustrate that identified best fitting model of individual gauging station is to some extent connected also with the flow regime as for most of the stations with the same flow regime also the same best fitting distribution was identified however it should be noted that differences in the aic and bic results in case of the precipitation informed models were in most cases smaller than 10 hilbe 2011 which could indicate that all precipitation informed models yield similar fit to the data we can conclude that precipitation informed models can in most cases adequately simulate the variability of floods in a changing climate even more successfully than time trend informed models furthermore the results of the study confirm the finding of bertola et al 2019 who argued that precipitation informed models are able to simulate long term flood fluctuations even in cases where no statistically significant trend in am series is detected credit authorship contribution statement mojca šraj conceptualization writing original

5289,this study aims to investigate the hydrologic applicability of an error correction method srem2d two dimensional stochastic satellite rainfall error model to three satellite precipitation products in streamflow simulations three satellite precipitation products including the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multiple satellite precipitation analysis tmpa real time 3b42 product 3b42rt the climate prediction centre cpc morphing technique cmorph gauge merged product cmorph bld and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data record persiann cdr are corrected using srem2d over the upper huaihe river basin streamflow ensemble simulations are derived by forcing the distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model with the srem2d based rainfall ensemble after applying srem2d to satellite precipitation products the streamflow simulations forced by tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr rainfall ensembles are capable to capture flood peaks however the streamflow simulations forced by cmorph bld rainfall ensemble show poor performance for the extreme events but exhibit good accuracy in non flood flow simulation the calibration of the model over the headwater subbasin betters the streamflow simulation especially for reproducing extreme events during the main flood cases overall srem2d provides great potential to facilitate the application of satellite precipitation products in water management and decision making over chinese river basins keywords srem2d satellite precipitation correction streamflow ensemble 1 introduction streamflow forecasts usually integrate gauge rainfall data into hydrologic models to derive discharge however the simulation of rainfall runoff process has been constrained in regions where gauge rainfall observations are sparse and large areas where point gauges have difficulty in delineating areal rainfall with the development of satellites and retrieval algorithms an increasing number of quasi global satellite rainfall products have been accessible in various temporal and spatial resolutions huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 kubota et al 2007 sorooshian et al 2000 previous researches have indicated that the emerging various satellite precipitation products are valuable alternative forcings for hydrologic simulation and they have shown great potential in different hydrometeorological applications including flood warning drought monitoring and water resource management domeneghetti et al 2019 harris et al 2007 pereira filho et al 2010 sun et al 2016 sun et al 2018 toté et al 2015 however the uncertainties of satellite rainfall estimation arising from different sources hong et al 2006 tian and peters lidard 2010 including the observation error retrieval error and bias adjustment procedure could result in large uncertainties in streamflow simulation falck et al 2015 hossain et al 2004 maggioni et al 2013 sun et al 2018 therefore correction of satellite rainfall estimation prior to hydrologic application is of great significance beaufort et al 2019 saber and yilmaz 2016 there are two main kinds of bias correction methods have been developed for satellite rainfall estimates including the conventional error correction methods piani et al 2010 sachindra et al 2014 terink et al 2010 which derive the statistical relationship between satellite rainfall estimates and the reference e g ground observations and the error correction models considering the uncertainties by adding perturbations to the rainfall estimates falck et al 2015 gebremichael et al 2011 hong et al 2006 hossain and anagnostou 2006a maggioni et al 2014 2016 conventional error correction methods usually assume that the satellite rainfall estimates and rainfall observations yield a statistical relationship fang et al 2015 kimani et al 2018 lenderink et al 2007 and then the fitted statistical relationship is applied to correct satellite rainfall estimates for generating deterministic hydrologic forcings for example statistical intensity distribution method was applied on gcm precipitation output over europe piani et al 2010 while fitted mean and coefficient of variation method was used to downscale the era15 data terink et al 2010 sachindra et al 2014 applied equidistant quantile mapping monthly bias correction and nested bias correction methods to hadcm3 model output in australia these conventional methods can be grouped into three major types regression methods weather classification and weather generator fang et al 2015 compared hydrologic impact of several bias correction methods in downscaling precipitation and temperature and indicated that different methods perform distinctly in downscaling precipitation and streamflow simulations ahmed et al 2013 lafon et al 2013 berg et al 2003 habib et al 2014 also the selection of the appropriate correction method strongly depends on the study case and region fang et al 2015 jie et al 2013 luo et al 2018 because the error characteristics of satellite rainfall estimates greatly vary under diverse hydrometeorological or topographic conditions obled et al 1994 woods and sivapalan 1999 for drainage basins featured with complex landscape or dramatically changed weather systems these deterministic correction methods obviously cannot represent the precipitation uncertainty information in hydrologic simulations therefore bias correction methods accounting for precipitation uncertainties need to be investigated gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 hossain and anagnostou 2006b teutschbein and seibert 2012 error model methods which are usually accomplished by perturbing the original rainfall product to statistically generate equiprobable rainfall fields have shown great potential in promoting streamflow simulation falck et al 2018 maggioni et al 2013 such as the nonlinear function error model hong et al 2006 the two dimensional error model srem2d developed by hossain and anagnostou 2006a push model maggioni et al 2014 2016 and nonparametric error model gebremichael et al 2011 in particular srem2d is an error model that can characterize multidimensional error structure of satellite rainfall estimates with respect to the reference precipitation falck et al 2015 hossain and anagnostou 2006a it can model the rainy and non rainy areas as well as the verification metrics miss and false alarms jointly that are not accounted by conventional correction methods the application of srem2d to satellite and radar rainfall estimates has improved flood monitoring in hydrological models across a range of basin scales under different topography mountain area and vast plain and hydrometeorological conditions north carolina in usa tocantins araguaia and iguaçu river basin in brazil falck et al 2015 2018 maggioni et al 2013 however there are still some unsolved questions with srem2d for example maggioni et al 2013 pointed out that all the srem2d generated streamflow simulations underestimate the actual error variability in addition falck et al 2015 suggested that the ability of srem2d is limited in improving streamflow simulations for basins smaller than 139 000 km2 the huaihe river basin hrb is located in the north south climate transitional belt of china which has extreme complexity in climate terrain landscape and hydrology ma et al 2014 with the intensification of global warming the drought flood abrupt alternation over the hrb has increased significantly over the past decades moreover the flood prone plain of hrb is inhabited by 13 of population of china and produces 25 of the commodity grain for the entire country qian and wang 2017 therefore an accurate and reliable flood monitoring system is essential and urgent for the socio economic development over the hrb the srem2d has not been applied over a catchment in the east asian monsoon region which has extremely complex hydrological scenarios and different climate conditions from the previous applications it is of great significance to investigate the capability of srem2d in the bias removal of satellite rainfall estimates and facilitate streamflow simulations in such a heterogeneous basin with large variability of floods and droughts in this study the srem2d is applied over the upper hrb to correct three satellite rainfall products and the hydrologic performance of srem2d generated ensembles is investigated to reduce the great impact of human activities downstream the upper region of hrb with a drainage area of 121 300 km2 is selected as the study basin the basin size smaller than 139 000 km2 is also challenging for the srem2d application falck et al 2015 the three widely used satellite products include the products that have not been gauge corrected tmpa 3b42rt and gauge adjusted persiann cdr and cmorph bld therefore the different performance of srem2d generated ensemble across product quality may reveal the impact of gauge adjustment and further help to understand how to choose products for specific hydrologic purposes in addition the calibration of the hydrologic model is conducted over the headwater subbasin to better characterizing the large uncertainty in the upstream area because increased uncertainties in physical characteristics and orographic effect over upstream liu et al 2016 strongly impact the runoff generation downstream wang et al 2014 also the streamflow simulation performance is verified over the basin interior stations and basin outlet which demonstrates the potential of srem2d to correct the rainfall bias for distributed hydrologic models section 2 provides a depiction of the study basin and dataset section 3 introduces the methods including the hydrologic model vic calibration and parameters and rainfall error model srem2d section 4 comprehensively evaluates the results of srem2d ensembles and section 5 presents the summary and discussion and the verification metrics for streamflow prediction are listed in the appendix 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin hrb is the sixth largest chinese river basin which has a drainage area of 270 000 km2 and classified as a humid and monsoon region in average 52 of the annual precipitation falls between june and august i e the main flood season of hrb wang et al 2009 the hrb is an important agricultural area with grain yield accounting for 17 of national grain production in china featured with dense population and frequent flood control there are 5674 reservoirs and 5427 floodgates over this basin carrying out functions like flood damage reduction crop irrigation and hydropower generation thus the observed streamflow of hrb is different from natural streamflow because of relatively fewer human activities the upper region of hrb with a drainage area of 121 300 km2 is selected in this study sun et al 2016 characterized by a wide plain the upper hrb has the elevation range from 300 to 2000 m bounded by the dabie mountains in the south basin and funiu mountains in the north edge the catchment is partitioned into six hydrologic subbasins including five subbasin stations and the bengbu outlet fig 2 2 2 data the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa selected as the precipitation observation is a daily precipitation analysis with a spatial resolution of 0 25 over mainland china the product has been developed from the measurements of 2400 meteorological stations using the optimal interpolation oi method and is recognized as the high quality preipitation product for various applications over mainland china shen and xiong 2016 all the report data for cgdpa are subject to strict quality control qc such as extreme and consistency test it provides the daily accumulated rainfall record ending at 00 utc and the minimum detectable rainfall intensity is 0 1 mm h the first selected satellite precipitation product is the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multiple satellite precipitation analysis tmpa real time 3b42 product 3b42rt produced by tmpa algorithm huffman et al 2007 2010 this algorithm first adjusts and calibrates estimates from different passive microwave retrieves pmw using observation from trmm satellite and then combines estimates from pmw and pmw calibrated infrared data the tmpa is 3 hourly and covers 50 n 50 s 180 w 180 e on a 0 25 grid both as post analysis 3b42 research product and in real time 3b42 rt gauge correction is not performed on 3b42rt which has worse quality than the research product 3b42 while 3b42rt can be accessible within the latency of a few hours for the application of real time product in flood monitoring the latest version 7 of the real time product 3b42rt v7 is chosen in this study the second product is the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data record persiann cdr the precipitation product is generated by first estimating precipitation using the artificial neural network ann to convert the input ir data into rain data the ann is trained using rainfall estimates from ncep stage iv hourly data then the bias is corrected with monthly global precipitation climatology project monthly data the persiann cdr dataset provides daily rainfall estimates covering 60 s to 60 n at 0 25 spatial resolution for the period of 1983 to present it can capture the spatial temporal variability of extreme event especially in the eastern china monsoon region miao et al 2015 the third product is the climate prediction centre cpc morphing technique cmorph gauge satellite merged product cmorph bld joyce et al 2004 the product is generated by using oi to merge the cmorph crt product with gauge observation cmorph crt product is generated by performing bias adjustment on cpc daily gauge analysis the cmorph bld product provides temporal and spatial resolutions of half hour and 8 km respectively covering 60 s to 60 n from january 1998 to present the daily discharge data of the bengbu hydrologic station sun et al 2016 from 2005 to 2012 is used divided into the calibration 2005 2008 and verification 2009 2012 period for interior stations fig 2 the daily discharge data is available from 2005 to 2012 in wangjiaba station while it can only be accessed from 2010 to 2012 for xixian fuyang and lutaizi stations thus the streamflow simulations are evaluated and compared at four interior stations for the overlapping period of 2010 2012 in addition the streamflow at wangjiaba station is simulated and verified using parameters calibrated at both the whole basin outlet bengbu and the headwater subbasin outlet wangjiaba respectively the daily meteorological data from 2005 to 2012 was collected at the china meteorological administration cma weather stations including daily average wind speed maximum and minimum air temperature 3 methodology 3 1 hydrologic model the vic model is a large scale and semi distributed hydrologic model liang et al 1994 1996 which has been widely used in flood warning water resource management land surface interactions and other hydrological applications chen et al 2018 umair et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 the current vic model has three layer soil model vic 3l assigning each model grid with different landcover types vegetation or bare soil the plant leaf area index lai the minimum leaf surface stomatal impedance albedo and the distribution ratio of roots in different soil layers the vic 3l model balances energy and moisture within each grid cell and parametrizes the impact of spatial variability of vegetation cover on land surface energy exchanges the surface flow is generated by the two top soil layers only following two major mechanism excess infiltration and excess saturation 3 1 1 hydrologic model implementation the vic model is implemented in water balance mode energy balance is closed at the 0 25 resolution driven by daily satellite precipitation products and cgdpa grid cell runoff is routed through the routing model lohmann et al 1996 1998 through a grid based stream network other forcing data of the vic model include daily meteorological data average wind speed maximum and minimum air temperature on cma weather stations elevation flow direction cumulative flow and slope data are provided by the hydro1k which is a 30 arc second global digital elevation model dataset released by the united states geological survey usgs vegetation information is extracted from the university of maryland global land cover information which is available at 1 km resolution the soil classification information in study is obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa all data are processed as the model grid at the 0 25 resolution 3 1 2 parameters and calibration model calibration is carried out using the markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm dreamzs vrugt et al 2009 dreamzs is developed from the original dream different evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm which runs multiple markov chains simultaneously in this paper three parallel chains are used and each chain contained 1000 iterations the optimal parameters set are finally obtained after each chain s convergence altogether 3000 samples with the objective function of nash sutcliffe efficiency incorporated in the implementation of the algorithm the vic model has many parameters however most of which can be directly derived from the land surface dataset the common implementation nijssen et al 1997 shi et al 2008 sun et al 2016 approach involves the calibration of six parameters which are 1 the infiltration capacity curve parameter b which influence the partitioning of rainfall into direct runoff or infiltration 2 d2 and d3 the second and third soil layer thickness which influence the availability of water for transpiration and baseflow respectively 3 the maximum baseflow velocity dsmax the fraction of maximum baseflow velocity ds the fraction of maximum soil moisture content of the third layer ws which affect the time the water stored in the third layer to evacuate as baseflow the calibration is performed for two scenarios first the vic model is calibrated for the whole basin at the bengbu hydrologic station then the model is calibrated for the headwater subbasin which has the outlet of wangjiaba station fig 2 to better consider the uncertainty in the upstream area of large basin hereafter the streamflow simulations at wangjiaba station using calibrated parameters over the subbasin is named wangjiaba sub 3 2 srem2d model the two dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d was initially developed to characterize the multidimensional error structure in the satellite precipitation product hossain and anagnostou 2006a based on the high quality reference product i e ground observation maggioni et al 2013 redefined the srem2d procedure as three steps firstly the multidimensional error structure from the reference rainfall is derived with respect to each satellite rainfall product respectively then the error structure is used to perturb each original satellite product to generate reference like ensemble finally the generated reference like ensemble is used to force the hydrologic models to derive ensembles of streamflow simulations in this study the srem2d parameters table 1 are calibrated for each satellite product from january 2005 to december 2008 using the rain gauge observations as reference over the upper hrb the period from january 1 2009 to december 31 2012 is used for validation purpose 3 2 1 main modeling structure srem2d models 4 scenarios 2 2 contingency table in fig 1 hit miss false alarm and correct rejection accounting for three dimensional metrics 1 temporal error error varies in time 2 spatial error error varies in space 3 retrieval error magnitude of error in rainy areas falck et al 2015 3 2 2 model flowchart for the 2 2 contingency table fig 1 two sets of spatially correlated u 0 1 random fields controlled by parameters of rain and no rain correlation length respectively are generated for carrying out bernoulli trials to model the satellite s delineation of rainy and non rainy areas srem2d assigns a zero or non zero value to the corresponding simulation pixel through a bernoulli trail based on the reference rain rate if uniform u 0 1 random number in the corresponding pixel is less than podrain the simulation pixel is set as a nonzero value based on r sat r ref ε s where ε s is spatially and temporally autocorrelated controlled by parameters of μ σ ρ and retrieval error length otherwise the simulation pixel is set to zero similarly for non rainy area if uniform u 0 1 random number in this pixel is less than podnorain the simulation pixel is set to be zero otherwise the simulation pixel is assigned as a value statistically generated from the false alarm rain rate distribution this procedure is repeated multiple times to generate ensembles of synthetic satellite rainfall fields hossain and anagnostou 2006b 3 2 3 parameters all parameters hossain et al 2010 are calibrated based on the satellite rainfall estimates and ground observations reference mean and standard deviation μ and σ are defined in the error distribution the conditional i e reference 0 satellite rain rates r sat are statistically associated with the corresponding conditional reference rain rates reference 0 r ref as r sat r ref ε s where ε s is the satellite retrieval error and assumed to be log normally distributed a log transformation log r sat l o g r ref of this equation makes the ε s to be mapped to gaussian μ σ where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation podrain and podnorain are the frequency of detection for rain and no rain events which are calculated by the 2 2 contingency table fig 1 as p o d r a i n n a n a n c p o d n o r a i n n d n b n d podrain is also associated with the magnitude of reference rainfall in the form of sigmoidal function as follows pod rain r ref 1 a e x p b r ref where a and b are the required srem2d parameters false alarm rain rate distribution delineates the probability distribution of the satellite rainfall estimates when there are misses over non rainy areas it appears exponential like form as d false r ref λ e x p λ r sat the mean expected value of this distribution is the srem2d parameter 1 λ lag one temporal correlation is used to model the temporal variability of the u i e satellite rainfall bias as follows u i u ρ u i u where i denotes the time step it is identified by an autoregressive function with pertinent metric being the lag one temporal correlation in this paper the lag one correlation parameter is set to zero not used as the temporal correlation in the passive microwave retrieval error tmpa is found to have a negligible effect on streamflow prediction hossain et al 2004 maggioni et al 2013 correlation length rain length no rain length and retrieval error length in srem2d means the separation distance at which the correlation 0 3678 before calibrating the parameter all successfully detected rainy non rainy pixels are set to 1 and other pixels are set to 0 an empirical semi variogram γ h is then computed as follows γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where z x i and z x i h are pixel values at the distance of x i and x i h h is the lag distance km and n denotes the number of points between x i and x i h then the empirical function is assumed to be best characterized by an exponential model and be fitted as follows γ h c 0 c 1 e h c l where c 0 denotes the nugget variance c denotes sill variance and cl is the rain no rain correlation length for the retrieval error correlation length similar procedures are adopted using the difference between the non zero reference and non zero satellite pixel values 3 3 verification methods both deterministic and probabilistic verification methods are applied in this study to comprehensively evaluate the performance of corrected precipitation and derived streamflow ensemble deterministic methods include nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce bias root mean square error rmse relative bias rbias relative rmse rrmse frequency bias fb ets pod far pearson correlation coefficient cc probabilistic verification methods are applied to quantify skill of precipitation and streamflow ensembles including continuous ranked probability skill score crpss the spread rmse relationship cover rate cr and the d factor the detailed explanations and equations of the verification methods can be found in the appendix 4 results 4 1 hydrologic model calibration table 3 shows the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficient nsce results of the simulated streamflow forced by cgdpa and three satellite products during the calibration and validation periods at the interior stations xixian lutaizi and fuyang and the basin outlet bengbu station note that the vic hydrologic model has been calibrated by using cgdpa as input at the basin outlet whole basin calibration in the calibration period the cgdpa forced streamflow has the highest nsce of 0 8 followed by cmorph bld 0 76 and the similar nsce of streamflow forced by the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr products in the validation period the nsce of cgdpa forced streamflow is still the highest and the streamflow simulations forced by satellite rainfall products vary with year and product in 2010 when record breaking long and extreme rainfall and flood hit the basin the nsce of tmpa 3b42rt forced streamflow shows the best performance the performance of cmorph bld forced streamflow is comparable to the quality of cgdpa forced streamflow in year 2011 and 2012 when the basin is featured by drought and low flow table 4 shows the nsce of the simulated streamflow forced by different rainfall products at wangjiaba station using whole basin calibrated and subbasin calibrated hydrologic model parameters similar to the findings in table 3 the results of tmpa 3b42rt exhibits the best performance in 2010 while cmorph bld performs better in year 2011 and 2012 comparing to the simulations using the whole basin calibrated parameters the subbasin calibrated model exhibits excellent performance in 2010 while also shows relatively unstable performance in 2011 and 2012 it may be because that the rainfall and streamflow in the calibration period is generally larger than that in the validation period and then the derived hydrologic model parameters may suffer from large uncertainties such as irrigation in the relatively dry years of 2011 and 2012 furthermore small subbasin over the upstream is more sensitive to rainfall input 4 2 evaluation of srem2d precipitation ensembles fig 3 presents time series of cumulative precipitation for observation reference and the tmpa 3b42rt persiann cdr and cmorph bld products for each year during the validation period by perturbing each satellite product using srem2d error model the corresponding srem2d ensembles are generated and the cumulative precipitation is also shown fig 3 for comparison before applying srem2d cmorph bld exhibits the best performance while persiann cdr shows a positive bias and tmpa 3b42rt exhibits the largest overestimation it can be ascribed to the fact that an elaborated probability density function optimal interpolation pdf oi gauge correction method xie and xiong 2011 has been performed on cmorph bld while persiann cdr just adopts a simple gauge adjustment and tmpa 3b42rt has not been corrected using ground observations the three srem2d ensembles show different performance fig 3 the tmpa 3b42rt precipitation ensemble encapsulates the reference cumulative precipitation in 2009 however for the following three years the ensemble just partially reduces the bias by approaching the reference precipitation as the original product exhibits a large positive bias and srem2d cannot conduct enough bias correction the persiann cdr ensemble can envelop the unperturbed product and partially reference precipitation during most of the validation period maggioni et al 2013 the original cmorph bld product is nearly unbiased in 2010 and 2011 thus srem2d performs strong bias correction and the ensemble deviates from the unperturbed product for 2009 and 2011 the precipitation ensemble can obviously encapsulate the reference precipitation while the ensemble mean is much closed to the observed cumulative precipitation generally the unperturbed tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr products have relatively low quality leading to large spread and partial coverage of the reference precipitation in their ensembles for the cmorph bld product with higher quality srem2d largely corrects the bias in the generated precipitation ensemble for the overestimated year 2009 and 2012 while induces a slightly negative bias in the nearly unbiased year 2010 and 2011 to quantitatively evaluate the corrected precipitation ensemble the deterministic metrics including rmse bias rrmse rbias and frequency bias are present for the tmpa 3b42rt product the precipitation ensemble corrects its positive bias and decrease its error in each validation year fig 4 the persiann cdr precipitation ensemble shows a similar performance as tmpa 3b42rt product but generates a much larger correction in bias and rmse the cumulative precipitation verification of the original cmorph bld product is nearly unbiased in 2010 and 2011 fig 3 while the precipitation ensemble introduces a negative bias but simulates the random error fig 4 for 2009 and 2012 the cmorph bld precipitation ensemble corrects its positive bias or captures the reference random error fig 5 shows the rrmse and rbias at different precipitation threshold bins for the srem2d ensembles for the tmpa 3b42rt ensemble the bias and error at the 0 10 mm threshold are improved compared to the original product for the higher threshold bins 10 25 mm 25 50 mm and 50 200 mm the bias and error of the ensemble members are perturbed around the reference statistics for the persiann cdr product the bias and error at each bin threshold bin are corrected by the srem2d ensemble overall the generated precipitation ensemble can model the reference error and correct the bias at most precipitation bins for the original products with relatively lower quality tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr as the original cmorph bld product has relatively higher quality fig 3 the corresponding precipitation ensemble corrects its positive bias and error at the 0 10 mm threshold while it introduces a negative bias for other higher threshold bins fig 6 shows the frequency bias for the three products the tmpa 3b42rt precipitation ensemble corrects the frequency bias of its original product at the 0 1 mm light rain 10 mm moderate rain and 25 mm heavy rain thresholds while the ensemble has deteriorated performance at the 50 mm torrential rain threshold this may be because that the torrential precipitation in the training period for srem2d 2005 2008 is more frequent than that in the validation period 2009 2012 as for the persiann cdr product the precipitation ensemble corrects the frequency bias at each threshold for the cmorph bld product the precipitation ensemble corrects the negative and positive frequency bias at the 0 1 mm and 50 mm thresholds by contrast at the 10 mm and 25 mm thresholds the original product has a relatively small bias and the ensemble introduces a negative bias the probabilistic metrics are also applied to evaluate the srem2d precipitation ensembles the crpss and the relationship between the ensemble spread and the rmse of ensemble mean are used in this study table 2 shows the crpss of the srem2d precipitation ensembles and the improvement relative to the crpss of the corresponding original products all the crpss values indicates skillful positive and larger than 0 39 performance of the srem2d ensembles referenced to the climatological precipitation also the three ensembles show improves the original product with the increasing crpss values indicating that the srem2d ensemble can greatly enhance the reliability of precipitation the persiann cdr ensemble shows the largest skill improvement relative to the corresponding original product followed by the tmpa 3b42rt ensemble in general the cmorph bld ensemble exhibits the highest crpss larger than 0 8 but the smallest improvement which can be owing to the fact that the cmorph bld original product is relatively reliable fig 7 shows the spread rmse relationship of the precipitation ensembles for individual calibration and validation years for an ideal ensemble system the rmse of the ensemble mean should have the similar ensemble spread of the ensemble members in order to fully characterize the uncertainty information all of the spread rmse pairs are located around the diagonal line 1 1 perfect line for lower and moderate precipitation errors indicating that the ensemble members are fine to represent the precipitation uncertainty for extremely low errors such as the lowest error of the cmoprh product the ensemble appears overdispersive with the pairs above the diagonal line i e the variance of the ensemble members is much more than the small error for the higher errors the ensemble spread tends to underestimate the rmse suggesting that the srem2d precipitation ensemble is underdispersive i e the variance among the ensemble members is insufficient to match the larger error in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic verification the correction performance of the srem2d ensemble varies with the quality of the original product for the relative poor quality products tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr srem2d is able to correct its bias and encapsulate the reference random error for the cmorph bld product with relatively high quality srem2d can partially correct the bias while the original product has a large bias in general the spread rmse relationship reveals that the srem2d ensemble can represent the precipitation uncertainty especially for lower and moderate errors 4 3 application of satellite ensembles in streamflow simulations 4 3 1 forecast errors of srem2d streamflow ensembles time series of streamflow from the vic hydrologic model is simulated using the three satellite srem2d ensembles fig 8 over the upper hrb firstly original satellite precipitation products are applied to generate streamflow predictions tmpa 3b42rt product fig 8a shows the best performance in flood monitoring while highly overestimates non flood flow the persiann cdr product fig 8b underestimates the peak flow and highly overestimates non flood flow by contrast the cmorph bld product fig 8c performs the worst in peak flow simulation while produces better non flood flow simulation after applying srem2d the streamflow simulations of the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles improve the extreme event detection fig 8a b the peak flows can be enveloped by the ensemble intervals at both the hydrologic stations upstream xixian fuyang wangjiaba and wangjiaba sub and the hydrologic stations downstream lutaizi and bengbu here only the results at bengbu are present as other stations show similar performance the streamflow performance at the interior and outlet stations demonstrates the potential of srem2d to improve the streamflow simulations of distributed hydrologic model for the propagation error from rainfall to streamflow different product exhibits different bias of streamflow simulation although the error and bias of the tmpa rainfall ensemble figs 5 and 6 are partially reduced the tmpa streamflow ensemble fig 8a has not been improved compared to the corresponding original product because the hydrologic model parameters are calibrated using the reference precipitation ground observation the calibrated parameters in the vic hydrologic model may be inappropriate to deal with the overestimation in the tmpa rainfall ensemble which may induce more errors in streamflow predictions fig 8a the persiann cdr product shows a negative bias which can be corrected by srem2d in the streamflow simulation in the validation period fig 8b the persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42rt ensembles yield a larger spread to partially envelop the observed streamflow for all the interior stations and basin outlet for the cmorph bld product the underestimation errors of srem2d generated streamflow are partially propagated from the rainfall cumulative time series fig 3 causing a negative bias and a narrow spread in the streamflow ensemble fig 8c except for the cmorph bld ensemble of wangjiaba sub compared with the performance of streamflow simulation calibrated using the whole basin in wangjiaba station fig 9 the subbasin calibrated model wangjiaba sub shows better capability in flood monitoring for all the three products for the tmpa product and its corresponding streamflow ensemble of wangjiaba sub although the overestimation in rainfall leads to overestimated streamflow simulation the peak flow is improved compared to the whole basin calibrated simulations persiann cdr exhibits a similar performance as tmpa in the comparison between wangjiaba station and wangjiaba sub table 4 as for the cmorph bld product the streamflow improvement using the subbasin calibration is significant compared to the whole basin calibration the simulated streamflow after the subbasin recalibration also has the best performance among the three satellite precipitation products the observed streamflow is well depicted with slight overestimation of baseflow the subbasin recalibration procedure reduces the large uncertainty of model parameters over the headwater basin and thus improves the streamflow simulations in the upper subbasin outlet however for the subbasin calibrated models there are still some issues subbasin calibrated parameters are more sensitive to the rainfall input which could have more uncertainty in a small area therefore the simulated streamflow could be more easily affected by the difference of hydrometeorological conditions between the calibration and validation periods leading to the deteriorated performance in the validation period table 4 the forecast bias and forecast error figs 10 and 11 of simulated streamflow ensembles are calculated for different quantile bins 0 20 20 50 50 80 80 100 of the observed streamflow for all the interior stations and basin outlet similar to the overall performance fig 8 both the errors and biases for each bin of 3b42rt product indicate that the improvement gained by applying srem2d is limited the persiann cdr srem2d based rainfall ensemble corrects the negative bias in streamflow simulation for the high flow 80 100 quantile while the performance is slightly deteriorated for the rest quantiles by contrast the cmorph bld ensemble exhibits improved results for the lower flow intervals below 80 quantile while the deteriorated performance for the high flow accounts for the negative bias of the cmorph bld ensemble figs 3 and 5 as for wangjiaba station and wangjiaba sub the performance of wangjiaba station is superior to wangjiaba sub for the flow intervals below 80 because the observed rainfall and streamflow decreases significantly in the validation period the effect of the underestimation of simulation of wangjiaba is magnified while the simulation of wangjiaba sub turns into overestimation in the validation period the deterministic verification of streamflow ensemble is implemented at bengbu station other stations have similar performance not shown including the cc fig 12 a of simulated daily streamflow for each validation year and the ets pod and far fig 12b d at the observed thresholds 20 50 and 90 quantiles the cc of most streamflow ensemble members is larger than the original products indicating that the srem2d generated streamflow ensemble can delineate the hydrological process more accurately although the improvement may not be superior to some original products where the black dots are within the boxes fig 12a the streamflow reference error can still be modeled with added perturbations the ets of the persiann cdr ensemble is largely improved at the 90 exceedance probability while encapsulates the reference random error at the 20 and 50 quantiles on the contrary the cmorph bld ensemble exhibits improved ets at the 20 and 50 quantiles while is deteriorated at the 90 quantile the pod of the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles is improved at the 50 quantile while the cmorph bld ensemble shows improved far for all thresholds the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles show relatively good capability in identifying high streamflow events ets pod and far by contrast the cmorph bld ensemble corrects the bias for low and middle flows ets and far but decreases the performance in the high flow simulation ets and pod which may be associated with the large bias introduced by srem2d for heavy precipitation correction in the cmorph bld precipitation ensemble figs 5 and 6 overall all the streamflow ensembles are able to correct the bias or simulate the reference random error combining the performance of the four metrics fig 12 table 5 shows the skillful probabilistic simulations positive crpss for each validation period at bengbu station indicating the reliability of srem2d generated streamflow ensembles for three products the crpss value is largest in 2010 high flow year for the tmpa and persiann cdr ensembles while the cmorph bld ensemble is the most superior in three low and middle flow years 2009 2011 and 2012 for hydrometeorological application the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles may produce more reliable probabilistic information in flood risk management while the cmorph bld ensemble has good potential for middle and low flow water resources management table 6 shows the cr and d factor for three streamflow ensembles in each validation year at the interior and bengbu stations for the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles there are relatively large cover rates and small ensemble intervals d factor smaller than 1 in the high flow year of 2010 and relatively modest cover rates in 2011 and 2012 from the upstream to the downstream the cr gradually decreases as runoff simulation error has been accumulated along the river channel but it performs more stable and reliable for the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles in the high flow year on the contrary the cmorph bld ensemble shows superior performance than the other two products in 2011 and 2012 for all the stations across the basin in summary the products with large bias can be perturbed to envelop the observed streamflow especially for peak flow the deterministic rrmse rbias cc ets pod and far and probabilistic crpss cr and d factor verification metrics reveal the improved reliability and accuracy of the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr streamflow ensembles at high flow simulations for the products with relatively high quality though srem2d may introduce forecast bias in peak flow simulations it still may partially correct its systematic bias non flood flow simulation in this study in addition for each quantile bin there always exists at least one streamflow ensemble that outperforms the reference streamflow which suggests that a more accurate prediction can be derived by merging the three streamflow ensembles also it is recommended to calibrate the hydrologic model over the headwater basin and it can help to produce more accurate streamflow simulations especially for extreme events 4 3 2 event based performance this section examines the event based performance of the eight largest flood events table 7 selected from 2010 to 2012 figs 13 and 14 show the hydrographs of the eight flood cases forced by the srem2d ensembles unperturbed satellite rainfall products and ground based rainfall product for bengbu wangjiaba and wangjiaba sub the results of other interior stations xixian lutaizi and fuyang not shown present similar performance to that of bengbu for wangjiaba station the streamflow simulations forced by ground rainfall observation reference flow underestimates the peaks for all of the cases fig 14a while original persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42rt products can reproduce several peaks although they are underestimated in most cases however by perturbing the satellite rainfall products using srem2d the streamflow ensemble is able to encapsulate flood peaks almost in all of the cases for the cmorph bld product the original product forced streamflow underestimates most of the flood peaks and the streamflow ensemble fails to correct the underestimation of high flow for wangjiaba sub fig 14b the subbasin calibrated hydrologic model can obviously improve the capability of capturing the flood peaks of all the cases for three ensembles furthermore not only flood peaks but the whole flood hydrograph can be encapsulated by the three ensemble intervals it suggests that the subbasin calibration over the headwater basin shows great potential to improve the extreme event monitoring for bengbu station cgdpa forced and satellite forced streamflow underestimate several peaks while the srem2d ensembles encapsulate nearly all of the peaks the poor performance of the cmorph bld ensemble in high flow simulation is associated with ineffective bias correction of the underestimation in the original product the results of interior stations xixian lutaizi and fuyang are similar to that of bengbu it demonstrates the potential of srem2d to monitor flood hazards at all the major stations over a large basin in summary the srem2d based streamflow ensemble has the potential to provide valuable probabilistic information for extreme event monitoring calibration of the vic model over the upper basin can also help to improve the extreme event monitoring 5 summary and discussions previous applications of error correction ensembles in satellite precipitation products have achieved success in the improvement of streamflow simulation over various basins in the united states and brazil such as the srem2d error model this study has applies the srem2d error correction ensembles to three sets of satellite precipitation products and the corrected precipitation products are used to improve streamflow ensemble simulation in the vic model over the upper huaihe river basin an extremely complex watershed of china the srem2d error model can simulate comprehensive error structure of rainfall thus shows greater potential to improve streamflow simulation in addition this calibration of the vic model over the headwater area may improve the flood peak simulation the srem2d based precipitation ensembles are evaluated compared with the cgdpa gauge analysis which is also used as the reference rainfall for the cmorph bld product with higher quality because of gauge adjustment srem2d reduces the overestimation of the cmorph product in light precipitation but introduces a slight dry bias by contrast for the tmpa and persiann products with relatively modest quality srem2d generates a large ensemble spread to encapsulate reference rainfall and reduces the positive bias of the two products the streamflow ensemble further demonstrates that srem2d improves the simulation capability of the cmorph bld ensemble by correcting the bias rrmse and rbias in low and middle flows at all stations indicating that the corrected cmorph has high potential for drought monitoring the deterministic and probabilistic verification of streamflow ensemble forced by the tmpa and persiann srem2d based precipitation ensembles shows high accuracy rrmse rbias cc ets pod and far and reliability crpss cr and d factor for high flows indicating that these two corrected precipitation ensembles have high potential for flood monitoring obviously the combination of srem2d with different precipitation products can effectively monitor different types of disasters over the upper huaihe river basin and thus more efficiently manage the risk of the drought flood abrupt alternation therefore it is insufficient to choose a single satellite product to conduct streamflow simulations according to its overall performance over a region such as mainland china as various remote sensing products are emerging more satellite products can be chosen according to the error structure characteristics over a basin and then these products can be perturbed such as srem2d to construct precipitation ensemble to achieve specific hydrologic goals the calibration procedure for the hydrologic model over the upper basin generally improves the performance of streamflow simulations it suggests that the distributed hydrologic simulation needs to consider the subbasin uncertainty liu et al 2016 moreover the interior stations and outlet stations of the basin exhibit similar improvements of streamflow simulation which further verify the ability of srem2d to correct the spatial bias of rainfall in summary the srem2d is an effective method to improve the streamflow simulations and provide useful information for water resource management and flood risk management over a heterogeneous hydrologic region in china however only three sets of satellite precipitations estimates are examined in this study more satellite precipitation products such as gsmap kubota et al 2007 and various basins are needed to be investigated furthermore the hydrologic model structure uncertainty is also needed to be accounted for better characterizing the streamflow prediction uncertainty additional information such as the water usage over a basin may also contribute to the improved calibration of the distributed hydrologic model credit authorship contribution statement fangliang chen conceptualization methodology resources data curation formal analysis visualization

5289,this study aims to investigate the hydrologic applicability of an error correction method srem2d two dimensional stochastic satellite rainfall error model to three satellite precipitation products in streamflow simulations three satellite precipitation products including the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multiple satellite precipitation analysis tmpa real time 3b42 product 3b42rt the climate prediction centre cpc morphing technique cmorph gauge merged product cmorph bld and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data record persiann cdr are corrected using srem2d over the upper huaihe river basin streamflow ensemble simulations are derived by forcing the distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model with the srem2d based rainfall ensemble after applying srem2d to satellite precipitation products the streamflow simulations forced by tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr rainfall ensembles are capable to capture flood peaks however the streamflow simulations forced by cmorph bld rainfall ensemble show poor performance for the extreme events but exhibit good accuracy in non flood flow simulation the calibration of the model over the headwater subbasin betters the streamflow simulation especially for reproducing extreme events during the main flood cases overall srem2d provides great potential to facilitate the application of satellite precipitation products in water management and decision making over chinese river basins keywords srem2d satellite precipitation correction streamflow ensemble 1 introduction streamflow forecasts usually integrate gauge rainfall data into hydrologic models to derive discharge however the simulation of rainfall runoff process has been constrained in regions where gauge rainfall observations are sparse and large areas where point gauges have difficulty in delineating areal rainfall with the development of satellites and retrieval algorithms an increasing number of quasi global satellite rainfall products have been accessible in various temporal and spatial resolutions huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 kubota et al 2007 sorooshian et al 2000 previous researches have indicated that the emerging various satellite precipitation products are valuable alternative forcings for hydrologic simulation and they have shown great potential in different hydrometeorological applications including flood warning drought monitoring and water resource management domeneghetti et al 2019 harris et al 2007 pereira filho et al 2010 sun et al 2016 sun et al 2018 toté et al 2015 however the uncertainties of satellite rainfall estimation arising from different sources hong et al 2006 tian and peters lidard 2010 including the observation error retrieval error and bias adjustment procedure could result in large uncertainties in streamflow simulation falck et al 2015 hossain et al 2004 maggioni et al 2013 sun et al 2018 therefore correction of satellite rainfall estimation prior to hydrologic application is of great significance beaufort et al 2019 saber and yilmaz 2016 there are two main kinds of bias correction methods have been developed for satellite rainfall estimates including the conventional error correction methods piani et al 2010 sachindra et al 2014 terink et al 2010 which derive the statistical relationship between satellite rainfall estimates and the reference e g ground observations and the error correction models considering the uncertainties by adding perturbations to the rainfall estimates falck et al 2015 gebremichael et al 2011 hong et al 2006 hossain and anagnostou 2006a maggioni et al 2014 2016 conventional error correction methods usually assume that the satellite rainfall estimates and rainfall observations yield a statistical relationship fang et al 2015 kimani et al 2018 lenderink et al 2007 and then the fitted statistical relationship is applied to correct satellite rainfall estimates for generating deterministic hydrologic forcings for example statistical intensity distribution method was applied on gcm precipitation output over europe piani et al 2010 while fitted mean and coefficient of variation method was used to downscale the era15 data terink et al 2010 sachindra et al 2014 applied equidistant quantile mapping monthly bias correction and nested bias correction methods to hadcm3 model output in australia these conventional methods can be grouped into three major types regression methods weather classification and weather generator fang et al 2015 compared hydrologic impact of several bias correction methods in downscaling precipitation and temperature and indicated that different methods perform distinctly in downscaling precipitation and streamflow simulations ahmed et al 2013 lafon et al 2013 berg et al 2003 habib et al 2014 also the selection of the appropriate correction method strongly depends on the study case and region fang et al 2015 jie et al 2013 luo et al 2018 because the error characteristics of satellite rainfall estimates greatly vary under diverse hydrometeorological or topographic conditions obled et al 1994 woods and sivapalan 1999 for drainage basins featured with complex landscape or dramatically changed weather systems these deterministic correction methods obviously cannot represent the precipitation uncertainty information in hydrologic simulations therefore bias correction methods accounting for precipitation uncertainties need to be investigated gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 hossain and anagnostou 2006b teutschbein and seibert 2012 error model methods which are usually accomplished by perturbing the original rainfall product to statistically generate equiprobable rainfall fields have shown great potential in promoting streamflow simulation falck et al 2018 maggioni et al 2013 such as the nonlinear function error model hong et al 2006 the two dimensional error model srem2d developed by hossain and anagnostou 2006a push model maggioni et al 2014 2016 and nonparametric error model gebremichael et al 2011 in particular srem2d is an error model that can characterize multidimensional error structure of satellite rainfall estimates with respect to the reference precipitation falck et al 2015 hossain and anagnostou 2006a it can model the rainy and non rainy areas as well as the verification metrics miss and false alarms jointly that are not accounted by conventional correction methods the application of srem2d to satellite and radar rainfall estimates has improved flood monitoring in hydrological models across a range of basin scales under different topography mountain area and vast plain and hydrometeorological conditions north carolina in usa tocantins araguaia and iguaçu river basin in brazil falck et al 2015 2018 maggioni et al 2013 however there are still some unsolved questions with srem2d for example maggioni et al 2013 pointed out that all the srem2d generated streamflow simulations underestimate the actual error variability in addition falck et al 2015 suggested that the ability of srem2d is limited in improving streamflow simulations for basins smaller than 139 000 km2 the huaihe river basin hrb is located in the north south climate transitional belt of china which has extreme complexity in climate terrain landscape and hydrology ma et al 2014 with the intensification of global warming the drought flood abrupt alternation over the hrb has increased significantly over the past decades moreover the flood prone plain of hrb is inhabited by 13 of population of china and produces 25 of the commodity grain for the entire country qian and wang 2017 therefore an accurate and reliable flood monitoring system is essential and urgent for the socio economic development over the hrb the srem2d has not been applied over a catchment in the east asian monsoon region which has extremely complex hydrological scenarios and different climate conditions from the previous applications it is of great significance to investigate the capability of srem2d in the bias removal of satellite rainfall estimates and facilitate streamflow simulations in such a heterogeneous basin with large variability of floods and droughts in this study the srem2d is applied over the upper hrb to correct three satellite rainfall products and the hydrologic performance of srem2d generated ensembles is investigated to reduce the great impact of human activities downstream the upper region of hrb with a drainage area of 121 300 km2 is selected as the study basin the basin size smaller than 139 000 km2 is also challenging for the srem2d application falck et al 2015 the three widely used satellite products include the products that have not been gauge corrected tmpa 3b42rt and gauge adjusted persiann cdr and cmorph bld therefore the different performance of srem2d generated ensemble across product quality may reveal the impact of gauge adjustment and further help to understand how to choose products for specific hydrologic purposes in addition the calibration of the hydrologic model is conducted over the headwater subbasin to better characterizing the large uncertainty in the upstream area because increased uncertainties in physical characteristics and orographic effect over upstream liu et al 2016 strongly impact the runoff generation downstream wang et al 2014 also the streamflow simulation performance is verified over the basin interior stations and basin outlet which demonstrates the potential of srem2d to correct the rainfall bias for distributed hydrologic models section 2 provides a depiction of the study basin and dataset section 3 introduces the methods including the hydrologic model vic calibration and parameters and rainfall error model srem2d section 4 comprehensively evaluates the results of srem2d ensembles and section 5 presents the summary and discussion and the verification metrics for streamflow prediction are listed in the appendix 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin hrb is the sixth largest chinese river basin which has a drainage area of 270 000 km2 and classified as a humid and monsoon region in average 52 of the annual precipitation falls between june and august i e the main flood season of hrb wang et al 2009 the hrb is an important agricultural area with grain yield accounting for 17 of national grain production in china featured with dense population and frequent flood control there are 5674 reservoirs and 5427 floodgates over this basin carrying out functions like flood damage reduction crop irrigation and hydropower generation thus the observed streamflow of hrb is different from natural streamflow because of relatively fewer human activities the upper region of hrb with a drainage area of 121 300 km2 is selected in this study sun et al 2016 characterized by a wide plain the upper hrb has the elevation range from 300 to 2000 m bounded by the dabie mountains in the south basin and funiu mountains in the north edge the catchment is partitioned into six hydrologic subbasins including five subbasin stations and the bengbu outlet fig 2 2 2 data the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa selected as the precipitation observation is a daily precipitation analysis with a spatial resolution of 0 25 over mainland china the product has been developed from the measurements of 2400 meteorological stations using the optimal interpolation oi method and is recognized as the high quality preipitation product for various applications over mainland china shen and xiong 2016 all the report data for cgdpa are subject to strict quality control qc such as extreme and consistency test it provides the daily accumulated rainfall record ending at 00 utc and the minimum detectable rainfall intensity is 0 1 mm h the first selected satellite precipitation product is the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multiple satellite precipitation analysis tmpa real time 3b42 product 3b42rt produced by tmpa algorithm huffman et al 2007 2010 this algorithm first adjusts and calibrates estimates from different passive microwave retrieves pmw using observation from trmm satellite and then combines estimates from pmw and pmw calibrated infrared data the tmpa is 3 hourly and covers 50 n 50 s 180 w 180 e on a 0 25 grid both as post analysis 3b42 research product and in real time 3b42 rt gauge correction is not performed on 3b42rt which has worse quality than the research product 3b42 while 3b42rt can be accessible within the latency of a few hours for the application of real time product in flood monitoring the latest version 7 of the real time product 3b42rt v7 is chosen in this study the second product is the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data record persiann cdr the precipitation product is generated by first estimating precipitation using the artificial neural network ann to convert the input ir data into rain data the ann is trained using rainfall estimates from ncep stage iv hourly data then the bias is corrected with monthly global precipitation climatology project monthly data the persiann cdr dataset provides daily rainfall estimates covering 60 s to 60 n at 0 25 spatial resolution for the period of 1983 to present it can capture the spatial temporal variability of extreme event especially in the eastern china monsoon region miao et al 2015 the third product is the climate prediction centre cpc morphing technique cmorph gauge satellite merged product cmorph bld joyce et al 2004 the product is generated by using oi to merge the cmorph crt product with gauge observation cmorph crt product is generated by performing bias adjustment on cpc daily gauge analysis the cmorph bld product provides temporal and spatial resolutions of half hour and 8 km respectively covering 60 s to 60 n from january 1998 to present the daily discharge data of the bengbu hydrologic station sun et al 2016 from 2005 to 2012 is used divided into the calibration 2005 2008 and verification 2009 2012 period for interior stations fig 2 the daily discharge data is available from 2005 to 2012 in wangjiaba station while it can only be accessed from 2010 to 2012 for xixian fuyang and lutaizi stations thus the streamflow simulations are evaluated and compared at four interior stations for the overlapping period of 2010 2012 in addition the streamflow at wangjiaba station is simulated and verified using parameters calibrated at both the whole basin outlet bengbu and the headwater subbasin outlet wangjiaba respectively the daily meteorological data from 2005 to 2012 was collected at the china meteorological administration cma weather stations including daily average wind speed maximum and minimum air temperature 3 methodology 3 1 hydrologic model the vic model is a large scale and semi distributed hydrologic model liang et al 1994 1996 which has been widely used in flood warning water resource management land surface interactions and other hydrological applications chen et al 2018 umair et al 2018 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 the current vic model has three layer soil model vic 3l assigning each model grid with different landcover types vegetation or bare soil the plant leaf area index lai the minimum leaf surface stomatal impedance albedo and the distribution ratio of roots in different soil layers the vic 3l model balances energy and moisture within each grid cell and parametrizes the impact of spatial variability of vegetation cover on land surface energy exchanges the surface flow is generated by the two top soil layers only following two major mechanism excess infiltration and excess saturation 3 1 1 hydrologic model implementation the vic model is implemented in water balance mode energy balance is closed at the 0 25 resolution driven by daily satellite precipitation products and cgdpa grid cell runoff is routed through the routing model lohmann et al 1996 1998 through a grid based stream network other forcing data of the vic model include daily meteorological data average wind speed maximum and minimum air temperature on cma weather stations elevation flow direction cumulative flow and slope data are provided by the hydro1k which is a 30 arc second global digital elevation model dataset released by the united states geological survey usgs vegetation information is extracted from the university of maryland global land cover information which is available at 1 km resolution the soil classification information in study is obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa all data are processed as the model grid at the 0 25 resolution 3 1 2 parameters and calibration model calibration is carried out using the markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm dreamzs vrugt et al 2009 dreamzs is developed from the original dream different evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm which runs multiple markov chains simultaneously in this paper three parallel chains are used and each chain contained 1000 iterations the optimal parameters set are finally obtained after each chain s convergence altogether 3000 samples with the objective function of nash sutcliffe efficiency incorporated in the implementation of the algorithm the vic model has many parameters however most of which can be directly derived from the land surface dataset the common implementation nijssen et al 1997 shi et al 2008 sun et al 2016 approach involves the calibration of six parameters which are 1 the infiltration capacity curve parameter b which influence the partitioning of rainfall into direct runoff or infiltration 2 d2 and d3 the second and third soil layer thickness which influence the availability of water for transpiration and baseflow respectively 3 the maximum baseflow velocity dsmax the fraction of maximum baseflow

scenarios first the vic model is calibrated for the whole basin at the bengbu hydrologic station then the model is calibrated for the headwater subbasin which has the outlet of wangjiaba station fig 2 to better consider the uncertainty in the upstream area of large basin hereafter the streamflow simulations at wangjiaba station using calibrated parameters over the subbasin is named wangjiaba sub 3 2 srem2d model the two dimensional satellite rainfall error model srem2d was initially developed to characterize the multidimensional error structure in the satellite precipitation product hossain and anagnostou 2006a based on the high quality reference product i e ground observation maggioni et al 2013 redefined the srem2d procedure as three steps firstly the multidimensional error structure from the reference rainfall is derived with respect to each satellite rainfall product respectively then the error structure is used to perturb each original satellite product to generate reference like ensemble finally the generated reference like ensemble is used to force the hydrologic models to derive ensembles of streamflow simulations in this study the srem2d parameters table 1 are calibrated for each satellite product from january 2005 to december 2008 using the rain gauge observations as reference over the upper hrb the period from january 1 2009 to december 31 2012 is used for validation purpose 3 2 1 main modeling structure srem2d models 4 scenarios 2 2 contingency table in fig 1 hit miss false alarm and correct rejection accounting for three dimensional metrics 1 temporal

of spatially correlated u 0 1 random fields controlled by parameters of rain and no rain correlation length respectively are generated for carrying out bernoulli trials to model the satellite s delineation of rainy and non rainy areas srem2d assigns a zero or non zero value to the corresponding simulation pixel through a bernoulli trail based on the reference rain rate if uniform u 0 1 random number in the corresponding pixel is less than podrain the simulation pixel is set as a nonzero value based on r sat r ref ε s where ε s is spatially and temporally autocorrelated controlled by parameters of μ σ ρ and retrieval error length otherwise the simulation pixel is set to zero similarly for non rainy area if uniform u 0 1 random number in this pixel is less than podnorain the simulation pixel is set to be zero otherwise the simulation pixel is assigned as a value statistically generated from the false alarm rain rate distribution this procedure is repeated multiple times to generate ensembles of synthetic satellite rainfall fields hossain and anagnostou 2006b 3 2 3 parameters all parameters hossain et al 2010 are calibrated based on the satellite rainfall estimates

and n denotes the number of points between x i and x i h then the empirical function is assumed to be best characterized by an exponential model and be fitted as follows γ h c 0 c 1 e h c l where c 0 denotes the nugget variance c denotes sill variance and cl is the rain no rain correlation length for the retrieval error correlation length similar procedures are adopted using the difference between the non zero reference and non zero satellite pixel values 3 3 verification methods both deterministic and probabilistic verification methods are applied in this study to comprehensively evaluate the performance of corrected precipitation and derived streamflow ensemble deterministic methods include nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce bias root mean square error rmse relative bias rbias relative rmse rrmse frequency bias fb ets pod far pearson correlation coefficient cc probabilistic verification methods are applied to quantify skill of precipitation and streamflow ensembles including continuous ranked probability skill score crpss the spread rmse relationship cover rate cr and the d factor the detailed explanations and equations of the verification methods can be found in the appendix 4 results 4 1 hydrologic model calibration table 3 shows the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficient nsce results of the simulated streamflow forced by cgdpa and three satellite products during the calibration and validation periods at the interior stations xixian lutaizi and fuyang and the basin outlet bengbu station note that the vic hydrologic model has been calibrated by using cgdpa as input at the basin outlet whole basin calibration in the calibration period the cgdpa forced streamflow has the highest nsce of 0 8 followed by cmorph bld 0 76 and the similar nsce of streamflow forced by the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr products in the validation period the nsce of cgdpa forced streamflow is still the highest and the streamflow simulations forced by satellite rainfall products vary with year and product in 2010 when record breaking long and extreme rainfall and flood hit the basin the nsce of tmpa 3b42rt forced streamflow shows the best performance the performance of cmorph bld forced streamflow is comparable to the quality of cgdpa forced streamflow in year 2011 and 2012 when the basin is featured by drought and low flow table 4 shows the nsce of the simulated streamflow forced by different rainfall products at wangjiaba station using whole basin calibrated and subbasin calibrated hydrologic model parameters similar to the findings in table 3 the results of tmpa 3b42rt exhibits the best performance in 2010 while cmorph bld performs better in year 2011 and 2012 comparing to the simulations using the whole basin calibrated parameters the subbasin calibrated model exhibits excellent performance in 2010 while also shows relatively unstable performance in 2011 and 2012 it may be because that the rainfall and streamflow in the calibration period is generally larger than that in the validation period and then the derived hydrologic model parameters may suffer from large uncertainties such as irrigation in the relatively dry years of 2011 and 2012 furthermore small subbasin over the upstream is more sensitive to rainfall input 4 2 evaluation of srem2d precipitation ensembles fig 3 presents time series of cumulative precipitation for observation reference and the tmpa 3b42rt persiann cdr and cmorph bld products for each year during the validation period by perturbing each satellite product using srem2d error model the corresponding srem2d ensembles are generated and the cumulative precipitation is also shown fig 3 for comparison before applying srem2d cmorph bld exhibits the best performance while persiann cdr shows a positive bias and tmpa 3b42rt exhibits the largest overestimation it can be ascribed to the fact that an elaborated probability density function optimal interpolation pdf oi gauge correction method xie and xiong 2011 has been performed on cmorph bld while persiann cdr just adopts a simple gauge adjustment and tmpa 3b42rt has not been corrected using ground observations the three srem2d ensembles show different performance fig 3 the tmpa 3b42rt precipitation ensemble encapsulates the reference cumulative precipitation in 2009 however for the following three years the ensemble just partially reduces the bias by approaching the reference precipitation as the original product exhibits a large positive bias and srem2d cannot conduct enough bias correction the persiann cdr ensemble can envelop the unperturbed product and partially reference precipitation during most of the validation period maggioni et al 2013 the original cmorph bld product is nearly unbiased in 2010 and 2011 thus srem2d performs strong bias correction and the ensemble deviates from the unperturbed product for 2009 and 2011 the precipitation ensemble can obviously encapsulate the reference precipitation while the ensemble mean is much closed to the observed cumulative precipitation generally the unperturbed tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr products have relatively low quality leading to large spread and partial coverage of the reference precipitation in their ensembles for the cmorph bld product with higher quality srem2d largely corrects the bias in the generated precipitation ensemble for the overestimated year 2009 and 2012 while induces a slightly negative bias in the nearly unbiased year 2010 and 2011 to quantitatively evaluate the corrected precipitation ensemble the deterministic metrics including rmse bias rrmse rbias and frequency bias are present for the tmpa 3b42rt product the precipitation ensemble corrects its positive bias and decrease its error in each validation year fig 4 the persiann cdr precipitation ensemble shows a similar performance as tmpa 3b42rt product but generates a much larger correction in bias and rmse the cumulative precipitation verification of the original cmorph bld product is nearly unbiased in 2010 and 2011 fig 3 while the precipitation ensemble introduces a negative bias but simulates the random error fig 4 for 2009 and 2012 the cmorph bld precipitation ensemble corrects its positive bias or captures the reference random error fig 5 shows the rrmse and rbias at different precipitation threshold bins for the srem2d ensembles for the tmpa 3b42rt ensemble the bias and error at the 0 10 mm threshold are improved compared to the original product for the higher threshold bins 10 25 mm 25 50 mm and 50 200 mm the bias and error of the ensemble members are perturbed around the reference statistics for the persiann cdr product the bias and error at each bin threshold bin are corrected by the srem2d ensemble overall the generated precipitation ensemble can model the reference error and correct the bias at most precipitation bins for the original products with relatively lower quality tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr as the original cmorph bld product has relatively higher quality fig 3 the corresponding precipitation ensemble corrects its positive bias and error at the 0 10 mm threshold while it introduces a negative bias for other higher threshold bins fig 6 shows the frequency bias for the three products the tmpa 3b42rt precipitation ensemble corrects the frequency bias of its original product at the 0 1 mm light rain 10 mm moderate rain and 25 mm heavy rain thresholds while the ensemble has deteriorated performance at the 50 mm torrential rain threshold this may be because that the torrential precipitation in the training period for srem2d 2005 2008 is more frequent than that in the validation period 2009 2012 as for the persiann cdr product the precipitation ensemble corrects the frequency bias at each threshold for the cmorph bld product the precipitation ensemble corrects the negative and positive frequency bias at the 0 1 mm and 50 mm thresholds by contrast at the 10 mm and 25 mm thresholds the original product has a relatively small bias and the ensemble introduces a negative bias the probabilistic metrics are also applied to evaluate the srem2d precipitation ensembles the crpss and the relationship between the ensemble spread and the rmse of ensemble mean are used in this study table 2 shows the crpss of the srem2d precipitation ensembles and the improvement relative to the crpss of the corresponding original products all the crpss values indicates skillful positive and larger than 0 39 performance of the srem2d ensembles referenced to the climatological precipitation also the three ensembles show improves the original product with the increasing crpss values indicating that the srem2d ensemble can greatly enhance the reliability of precipitation the persiann cdr ensemble shows the largest skill improvement relative to the corresponding original product followed by the tmpa 3b42rt ensemble in general the cmorph bld ensemble exhibits the highest crpss larger than 0 8 but the smallest improvement which can be owing to the fact that the cmorph bld original product is relatively reliable fig 7 shows the spread rmse relationship of the precipitation ensembles for individual calibration and validation years for an ideal ensemble system the rmse of the ensemble mean should have the similar ensemble spread of the ensemble members in order to fully characterize the uncertainty information all of the spread rmse pairs are located around the diagonal line 1 1 perfect line for lower and moderate precipitation errors indicating that the ensemble members are fine to represent the precipitation uncertainty for extremely low errors such as the lowest error of the cmoprh product the ensemble appears overdispersive with the pairs above the diagonal line i e the variance of the ensemble members is much more than the small error for the higher errors the ensemble spread tends to underestimate the rmse suggesting that the srem2d precipitation ensemble is underdispersive i e the variance among the ensemble members is insufficient to match the larger error in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic verification the correction performance of the srem2d ensemble varies with the quality of the original product for the relative poor quality products tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr srem2d is able to correct its bias and encapsulate the reference random error for the cmorph bld product with relatively high quality srem2d can partially correct the bias while the original product has a large bias in general the spread rmse relationship reveals that the srem2d ensemble can represent the precipitation uncertainty especially for lower and moderate errors 4 3 application of satellite ensembles in streamflow simulations 4 3 1 forecast errors of srem2d streamflow ensembles time series of streamflow from the vic hydrologic model is simulated using the three satellite srem2d ensembles fig 8 over the upper hrb firstly original satellite precipitation products are applied to generate streamflow predictions tmpa 3b42rt product fig 8a shows the best performance in flood monitoring while highly overestimates non flood flow the persiann cdr product fig 8b underestimates the peak flow and highly overestimates non flood flow by contrast the cmorph bld product fig 8c performs the worst in peak flow simulation while produces better non flood flow simulation after applying srem2d the streamflow simulations of the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles improve the extreme event detection fig 8a b the peak flows can be enveloped by the ensemble intervals at both the hydrologic stations upstream xixian fuyang wangjiaba and wangjiaba sub and the hydrologic stations downstream lutaizi and bengbu here only the results at bengbu are present as other stations show similar performance the streamflow performance at the interior and outlet stations demonstrates the potential of srem2d to improve the streamflow simulations of distributed hydrologic model for the propagation error from rainfall to streamflow different product exhibits different bias of streamflow simulation although the error and bias of the tmpa rainfall ensemble figs 5 and 6 are partially reduced the tmpa streamflow ensemble fig 8a has not been improved compared to the corresponding original product because the hydrologic model parameters are calibrated using the reference precipitation ground observation the calibrated parameters in the vic hydrologic model may be inappropriate to deal with the overestimation in the tmpa rainfall ensemble which may induce more errors in streamflow predictions fig 8a the persiann cdr product shows a negative bias which can be corrected by srem2d in the streamflow simulation in the validation period fig 8b the persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42rt ensembles yield a larger spread to partially envelop the observed streamflow for all the interior stations and basin outlet for the cmorph bld product the underestimation errors of srem2d generated streamflow are partially propagated from the rainfall cumulative time series fig 3 causing a negative bias and a narrow spread in the streamflow ensemble fig 8c except for the cmorph bld ensemble of wangjiaba sub compared with the performance of streamflow simulation calibrated using the whole basin in wangjiaba station fig 9 the subbasin calibrated model wangjiaba sub shows better capability in flood monitoring for all the three products for the tmpa product and its corresponding streamflow ensemble of wangjiaba sub although the overestimation in rainfall leads to overestimated streamflow simulation the peak flow is improved compared to the whole basin calibrated simulations persiann cdr exhibits a similar performance as tmpa in the comparison between wangjiaba station and wangjiaba sub table 4 as for the cmorph bld product the streamflow improvement using the subbasin calibration is significant compared to the whole basin calibration the simulated streamflow after the subbasin recalibration also has the best performance among the three satellite precipitation products the observed streamflow is well depicted with slight overestimation of baseflow the subbasin recalibration procedure reduces the large uncertainty of model parameters over the headwater basin and thus improves the streamflow simulations in the upper subbasin outlet however for the subbasin calibrated models there are still some issues subbasin calibrated parameters are more sensitive to the rainfall input which could have more uncertainty in a small area therefore the simulated streamflow could be more easily affected by the difference of hydrometeorological conditions between the calibration and validation periods leading to the deteriorated performance in the validation period table 4 the forecast bias and forecast error figs 10 and 11 of simulated streamflow ensembles are calculated for different quantile bins 0 20 20 50 50 80 80 100 of the observed streamflow for all the interior stations and basin outlet similar to the overall performance fig 8 both the errors and biases for each bin of 3b42rt product indicate that the improvement gained by applying srem2d is limited the persiann cdr srem2d based rainfall ensemble corrects the negative bias in streamflow simulation for the high flow 80 100 quantile while the performance is slightly deteriorated for the rest quantiles by contrast the cmorph bld ensemble exhibits improved results for the lower flow intervals below 80 quantile while the deteriorated performance for the high flow accounts for the negative bias of the cmorph bld ensemble figs 3 and 5 as for wangjiaba station and wangjiaba sub the performance of wangjiaba station is superior to wangjiaba sub for the flow intervals below 80 because the observed rainfall and streamflow decreases significantly in the validation period the effect of the underestimation of simulation of wangjiaba is magnified while the simulation of wangjiaba sub turns into overestimation in the validation period the deterministic verification of streamflow ensemble is implemented at bengbu station other stations have similar performance not shown including the cc fig 12 a of simulated daily streamflow for each validation year and the ets pod and far fig 12b d at the observed thresholds 20 50 and 90 quantiles the cc of most streamflow ensemble members is larger than the original products indicating that the srem2d generated streamflow ensemble can delineate the hydrological process more accurately although the improvement may not be superior to some original products where the black dots are within the boxes fig 12a the streamflow reference error can still be modeled with added perturbations the ets of the persiann cdr ensemble is largely improved at the 90 exceedance probability while encapsulates the reference random error at the 20 and 50 quantiles on the contrary the cmorph bld ensemble exhibits improved ets at the 20 and 50 quantiles while is deteriorated at the 90 quantile the pod of the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles is improved at the 50 quantile while the cmorph bld ensemble shows improved far for all thresholds the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles show relatively good capability in identifying high streamflow events ets pod and far by contrast the cmorph bld ensemble corrects the bias for low and middle flows ets and far but decreases the performance in the high flow simulation ets and pod which may be associated with the large bias introduced by srem2d for heavy precipitation correction in the cmorph bld precipitation ensemble figs 5 and 6 overall all the streamflow ensembles are able to correct the bias or simulate the reference random error combining the performance of the four metrics fig 12 table 5 shows the skillful probabilistic simulations positive crpss for each validation period at bengbu station indicating the reliability of srem2d generated streamflow ensembles for three products the crpss value is largest in 2010 high flow year for the tmpa and persiann cdr ensembles while the cmorph bld ensemble is the most superior in three low and middle flow years 2009 2011 and 2012 for hydrometeorological application the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles may produce more reliable probabilistic information in flood risk management while the cmorph bld ensemble has good potential for middle and low flow water resources management table 6 shows the cr and d factor for three streamflow ensembles in each validation year at the interior and bengbu stations for the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles there are relatively large cover rates and small ensemble intervals d factor smaller than 1 in the high flow year of 2010 and relatively modest cover rates in 2011 and 2012 from the upstream to the downstream the cr gradually decreases as runoff simulation error has been accumulated along the river channel but it performs more stable and reliable for the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr ensembles in the high flow year on the contrary the cmorph bld ensemble shows superior performance than the other two products in 2011 and 2012 for all the stations across the basin in summary the products with large bias can be perturbed to envelop the observed streamflow especially for peak flow the deterministic rrmse rbias cc ets pod and far and probabilistic crpss cr and d factor verification metrics reveal the improved reliability and accuracy of the tmpa 3b42rt and persiann cdr streamflow ensembles at high flow simulations for the products with relatively high quality though srem2d may introduce forecast bias in peak flow simulations it still may partially correct its systematic bias non flood flow simulation in this study in addition for each quantile bin there always exists at least one streamflow ensemble that outperforms the reference streamflow which suggests that a more accurate prediction can be derived by merging the three streamflow ensembles also it is recommended to calibrate the hydrologic model over the headwater basin and it can help to produce more accurate streamflow simulations especially for extreme events 4 3 2 event based performance this section examines the event based performance of the eight largest flood events table 7 selected from 2010 to 2012 figs 13 and 14 show the hydrographs of the eight flood cases forced by the srem2d ensembles unperturbed satellite rainfall products and ground based rainfall product for bengbu wangjiaba and wangjiaba sub the results of other interior stations xixian lutaizi and fuyang not shown present similar performance to that of bengbu for wangjiaba station the streamflow simulations forced by ground rainfall observation reference flow underestimates the peaks for all of the cases fig 14a while original persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42rt products can reproduce several peaks although they are underestimated in most cases however by perturbing the satellite rainfall products using srem2d the streamflow ensemble is able to encapsulate flood peaks almost in all of the cases for the cmorph bld product the original product forced streamflow underestimates most of the flood peaks and the streamflow ensemble fails to correct the underestimation of high flow for wangjiaba sub fig 14b the subbasin calibrated hydrologic model can obviously improve the capability of capturing the flood peaks of all the cases for three ensembles furthermore not only flood peaks but the whole flood hydrograph can be encapsulated by the three ensemble intervals it suggests that the subbasin calibration over the headwater basin shows great potential to improve the extreme event monitoring for bengbu station cgdpa forced and satellite forced streamflow underestimate several peaks while the srem2d ensembles encapsulate nearly all of the peaks the poor performance of the cmorph bld ensemble in high flow simulation is associated with ineffective bias correction of the underestimation in the original product the results of interior stations xixian lutaizi and fuyang are similar to that of bengbu it demonstrates the potential of srem2d to monitor flood hazards at all the major stations over a large basin in summary the srem2d based streamflow ensemble has the potential to provide valuable probabilistic information for extreme event monitoring calibration of the vic model over the upper basin can also help to improve the extreme event monitoring 5 summary and discussions previous applications of error correction ensembles in satellite precipitation products have achieved success in the improvement of streamflow simulation over various basins in the united states and brazil such as the srem2d error model this study has applies the srem2d error correction ensembles to three sets of satellite precipitation products and the corrected precipitation products are used to improve streamflow ensemble simulation in the vic model over the upper huaihe river basin an extremely complex watershed of china the srem2d error model can simulate comprehensive error structure of rainfall thus shows greater potential to improve streamflow simulation in addition this calibration of the vic model over the headwater area may improve the flood peak simulation the srem2d based precipitation ensembles are evaluated compared with the cgdpa gauge analysis which is also used as the reference rainfall for the cmorph bld product with higher quality because of gauge adjustment srem2d reduces the overestimation of the cmorph product in light precipitation but introduces a slight dry bias by contrast for the tmpa and persiann products with relatively modest quality srem2d generates a large ensemble spread to encapsulate reference rainfall and reduces the positive bias of the two products the streamflow ensemble further demonstrates that srem2d improves the simulation capability of the cmorph bld ensemble by correcting the bias rrmse and rbias in low and middle flows at all stations indicating that the corrected cmorph has high potential for drought monitoring the deterministic and probabilistic verification of streamflow ensemble forced by the tmpa and persiann srem2d based precipitation ensembles shows high accuracy rrmse rbias cc ets pod and far and reliability crpss cr and d factor for high flows indicating that these two corrected precipitation ensembles have high potential for flood monitoring obviously the combination of srem2d with different precipitation products can effectively monitor different types of disasters over the upper huaihe river basin and thus more efficiently manage the risk of the drought flood abrupt alternation therefore it is insufficient to choose a single satellite product to conduct streamflow simulations according to its overall performance over a region such as mainland china as various remote sensing products are emerging more satellite products can be chosen according to the error structure characteristics over a basin and then these products can be perturbed such as srem2d to construct precipitation ensemble to achieve specific hydrologic goals the calibration procedure for the hydrologic model over the upper basin generally improves the performance of streamflow simulations it suggests that the distributed hydrologic simulation needs to consider the subbasin uncertainty liu et al 2016 moreover the interior stations and outlet stations of the basin exhibit similar improvements of streamflow simulation which further verify the ability of srem2d to correct the spatial bias of rainfall in summary the srem2d is an effective method to improve the streamflow simulations and provide useful information for water resource management and flood risk management over a heterogeneous hydrologic region in china however only three sets of satellite precipitations estimates are examined in this study more satellite precipitation products such as gsmap kubota et al 2007 and various basins are needed to be investigated furthermore the hydrologic model structure uncertainty is also needed to be accounted for better characterizing the streamflow prediction uncertainty additional information such as the water usage over a basin may also contribute to the improved calibration of the distributed hydrologic model credit authorship contribution statement fangliang chen conceptualization methodology resources data curation formal analysis visualization
